J	Lazareno, S; Birdsall, NJM				Lazareno, S; Birdsall, NJM			Effects of contamination on radioligand binding parameters	TRENDS IN PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article								Radioligand binding studies are used to provide quantitative estimates of parameters such as the receptor density of a tissue and the affinity values of labelled and unlabelled ligands. The presence of an unlabelled competing contaminant, which might be present because of actual contamination, inadequate radioligand purification or the breakdown of the radioligand to an active species, has surprising effects on these estimates: the apparent affinity of the radioligand is increased but the K-i values of unlabelled ligands are unaffected. The most striking and sensitive effects are on radioligand association kinetics, which become independent of radioligand concentration at high radioligand concentrations.

There are three basic types of radioligand binding experiments: (1) saturation experiments from which the affinity of the radioligand for the receptor and the binding site density can be determined; (2) inhibition experiments from which the affinity of a competing, unlabeled compound for the receptor can be determined; and (3) kinetic experiments from which the forward and reverse rate constants for radioligand binding can be determined. Detailed methods for typical radioligand binding assays for G protein-coupled receptors in membranes and intact cells are presented for these types of experiments. Detailed procedures for analysis of the data obtained from these experiments are also given.

The method uses positron emission tomography (PET) of [C-11] yohimbine binding in brain to quantify the density and affinity of alpha(2) adrenoceptors under condition of changing radioligand binding to plasma proteins. We obtained dynamic PET recordings from brain of Spraque Dawley rats at baseline, followed by pharmacological challenge with unlabeled yohimbine (0.3 mg/kg). The challenge with unlabeled ligand failed to diminish radioligand accumulation in brain tissue, due to the blocking of radioligand binding to plasma proteins that elevated the free fractions of the radioligand in plasma. We devised a method that graphically resolved the masking of unlabeled ligand binding by the increase of radioligand free fractions in plasma. The Extended Inhibition Plot introduced here yielded an estimate of the volume of distribution of non-displaceable ligand in brain tissue that increased with the increase of the free fraction of the radioligand in plasma. The resulting binding potentials of the radioligand declined by 50-60% in the presence of unlabeled ligand. The kinetic unmasking of inhibited binding reflected in the increase of the reference volume of distribution yielded estimates of receptor saturation consistent with the binding of unlabeled ligand.

PSMA is basis for new diagnostics and theranostics. PET/CT using PSMA is more sensitive than choline PET/CT. Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy is mainly used for patients with end-stage prostate cancer. This report describes a patient with a third recurrence in lymph nodes. The recurrence was treated with Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy instead of chemotherapy with docetaxel. The effect was in part evaluated relative to that of two established salvage treatments. Prior salvage radiotherapy and abiraterone of the first and second recurrence in lymph nodes had given only a partial reduction of PSA. Nevertheless within five months of follow-up, Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy of the third recurrence in lymph nodes reduced PSA for a period to unmeasurable levels. Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy gave only mild adverse effects. In conclusion, for a patient with lymph node metastatic prostate cancer, Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy had an attractive therapeutic profile. A follow-up study of similar patients is being planned.

Muscarinic receptors mediate a wide array of physiological functions and impairment of muscarinic signaling is involved in numerous pathological conditions including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Reliable radioligand binding techniques allow study of involvement of individual muscarinic receptor subtypes in the physiology and pathology of muscarinic signaling, and study of the structure of muscarinic receptors and structure-activation relationship of muscarinic ligands. Here we discuss the current state of knowledge of radioligand binding experiments at muscarinic receptors from the perspective of available radioligands and selective unlabeled muscarinic ligands. We relate binding properties of muscarinic ligands to experimental design (e. g., nonspecific binding determination, incubation conditions, buffers, temperature). We also list tissue/cell sources of muscarinic receptors suitable for radioligand binding studies and describe procedures of cell and tissue preparation for radioligand binding experiments. We also describe several techniques of receptor-bound ligand separation applicable at muscarinic receptors and provide basic information for binding data analysis.

New tracers and combinations in radioligand therapy for prostate cancer	UROLOGIE			German	Article						Prostate-specific membrane antigen; (177)Lutetium; mCRPC; Targeted therapy; Radionuclide therapy		Background:(177)Lutetium radioligand therapy directed against the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a new approved option for the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer associated with a favorable toxicity profile.Objectives: What are new or emerging developments in radioligand therapy for prostate cancer? Materials and methods: A review of the current literature was performed. Results: The further development of radioligand therapy for prostate cancer is currently taking place primarily in the following areas: application in earlier stages of the disease, use of alternative isotopes, development and use of new ligands, search for new target structures and combination with other forms of therapy. Conclusions: Radioligand therapy has become an integral part of the therapy algorithm in the treatment of metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer. Application in earlier stages of the disease is foreseeable. In the future, new ligands, alternative isotopes, new targets or combination therapies may increase efficacy and reduce toxicity.

Radioligand binding exhibited high affinity, K-d = 2 nM, commensurate with its inhibitory potency against BACE1. Inhibition of radioligand binding in the presence of a range of different BACE1 inhibitors exhibited the same rank order of potency as for inhibition of BACE1 enzymatic activity. BACE1-dependent binding of the radioligand was also demonstrated in mouse brain homogenates, where genetic ablation of BACE1 eliminated high affinity binding. Thus, the radioligand [H-3] BMS-599240 is a novel tool potentially useful for evaluation of BACE1 enzyme in biological samples, and for evaluation of inhibitor binding to BACE1.

Here, we report the preparation and pharmacokinetic profile of its carbon-11 (t (1/2) = 20.4 min) labeled isotopolog [C-11]AZD4694 and compare [C-11]AZD4694 with the hitherto most widely applied amyloid PET radioligand [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB). The immediate unlabeled precursor to [C-11]AZD4694 was prepared in a four-step convergent synthesis. Subsequent N-C-11-methylation of this precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide yielded [C-11]AZD4694, which after isolation and formulation was injected into cynomolgus monkeys. The radioactivity in nonhuman primate brain following injection of [C-11]AZD4694 and [C-11]PiB was measured using PET. [C-11]AZD4694 was prepared in a 60 % incorporation yield. In a head to head comparison with [C-11]PiB, it appeared that [C-11]AZD4694 displayed slightly lower nonspecific binding in white matter than [C-11]PiB as well as more rapid pharmacokinetics in the brain. The advantageous pharmacokinetic profile and low nonspecific binding render [C-11]AZD4694 a promising PET radioligand for imaging of amyloid beta in the human brain with PET.

Characterization of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]LS-3-134, a novel arylamide phenylpiperazine D3 dopamine receptor selective radioligand	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						D2-like dopamine receptors; D3 dopamine receptors; dopamine receptors; radioligand binding	D-3 RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; MOLECULAR-CLONING; D1 RECEPTOR; BINDING; RAT; PHOSPHORYLATION; ACTIVATION; SODIUM; LIGAND	LS-3-134 is a substituted N-phenylpiperazine derivative that has been reported to exhibit: (i) high-affinity binding (K-i value 0.2nM) at human D3 dopamine receptors, (ii) >100-fold D3 versus D2 dopamine receptor subtype binding selectivity, and (iii) low-affinity binding (K-i>5000nM) at sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors. Based upon a forskolin-dependent activation of the adenylyl cyclase inhibition assay, LS-3-134 is a weak partial agonist at both D2 and D3 dopamine receptor subtypes (29% and 35% of full agonist activity, respectively). In this study, [H-3]-labeled LS-3-134 was prepared and evaluated to further characterize its use as a D3 dopamine receptor selective radioligand. Kinetic and equilibrium radioligand binding studies were performed. This radioligand rapidly reaches equilibrium (10-15min at 37 degrees C) and binds with high affinity to both human (K-d=0.06 +/- 0.01nM) and rat (K-d=0.2 +/- 0.02nM) D3 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Direct and competitive radioligand binding studies using rat caudate and nucleus accumbens tissue indicate that [H-3]LS-3-134 selectively binds a homogeneous population of binding sites with a dopamine D3 receptor pharmacological profile. Based upon these studies, we propose that [H-3]LS-3-134 represents a novel D3 dopamine receptor selective radioligand that can be used for studying the expression and regulation of the D3 dopamine receptor subtype.

Among a variety of experimental systems, the radioligand binding assay has remained as one of the main methods in this field for decades. Usually cell membranes or tissues are used in these experiments, however in this article we demonstrate that baculoviruses produced in Sf9 cells display recombinant receptors on their surface and therefore can be used in radioligand binding assay. Methods: We have used baculoviruses with dopamine D-1 receptors as a model system to validate the usage of this receptor preparation in radioligand binding experiments. In order to collect membrane receptors and separate free radioligand, we have applied FilterMate Harvester with Filtermat B. Results: Using baculoviruses with dopamine D-1 receptors as a model system, we have shown that this is a suitable preparation for conventional radioligand binding assay. Here, all the experiments were performed using the dopamine D-1-like receptor specific radioligand [H-3]SCH23390. There were no significant differences between binding parameters determined in membranes of Sf9 cells and baculovirus particles. Similar pIC50 and Ki values were also determined in competition binding assays with HEK293 cell membranes. Discussion: All the results obtained with baculovirus preparation were in good agreement with the data obtained in parallel experiments with membrane preparations from Sf9 and HEK293 cells expressing dopamine D-1 receptors. Shape uniformity, homogeneous distribution and slow sedimentation of the membranes are some of the advantages of baculovirus preparations, which prove them as promising source of membrane proteins for routine and high throughput analysis.

New analogs of mu-opioid receptors are introduced because they may have less adverse effects and better efficacy. However, these new analogs have to be screened for their receptor affinity before entering clinical trial phases. A common method to do such screening is using radioligand-binding-assay, which is a fast and precise screening technique if the assays are done at an optimum condition. One of the main challenges in this type of screening is to separate free/unbound radioligands from bound radioligands. In this study, we applied a centrifugation method instead of a filtration method to separate free radioligands from bound radioligands, and also optimized the conditions for radioligand receptor binding studies of mu-opioid receptors, saturation, and the competition. Methods We used the midbrain and brainstem of naltrexone-treated rats as a source of mu-opioid receptors, and [H-3]-DAMGO as the radioligand. Naloxone was also used to determine non-specific binding. A given amount of membrane protein was incubated with an increasing amount of radioligand at 37 degrees C to saturate the receptors at equilibrium and the amount of radioligand saturated in the receptors were used in competition studies. Results 160 mu g membrane protein saturated with 20 nM [H-3]-DAMGO at 37 degrees C for 35 min with K-d (15.06 nM, 95% CI 8.117-22.00) and B-max (0.4750 pmol/mg, 95% CI 0.3839-0.5660). Conclusion Applying the centrifugation method instead of the filtration to separate free from bound radioligand produced repeatable and reliable results. The optimum conditions for radioligand binding were used in competition studies which resulted in the expected outcomes.

Resulting from the numerous modifications that can be made to these basic targeting agents, research in this field often generates a series of compounds, as potential ligands for in vivo investigation. However, measuring each variant of a series in vivo can be both costly and time-consuming. Therefore, a number of in vitro assays, to study interactions between the targeted receptor and the ligands of interest, are frequently used to quickly and inexpensively narrow the field and identify a lead compound(s) for further investigation. For example, in saturation binding studies, the amount of radioligand required to saturate the receptors is measured and analyzed to determine the radioligand equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), a useful gauge of the receptor binding affinity of a radioligand. in competitive binding experiments, a ligand of interest competes for available receptor sites with a standard radioligand of known high receptor affinity. Competition data are analyzed to yield another indicator of receptor affinity, called all IC50 value, which can be used to rank the relative receptor binding affinities for a series of ligands. in internalization and efflux studies, the rate and extent of receptor-mediated radioligand taken into and subsequently released from cells is measured, providing insight into cellular uptake and retention of the radioligand. Individually or taken together, these in vitro receptor binding assays are useful tools in radiopharmaceutical development.	[Bigott-Hennkens, H. M.; Dannoon, S.; Jurisson, S.

PSMA has potential as a basis for new diagnostics and theragnostics. Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy is mainly used for patients with end-stage prostate cancer. This report describes seven PCa patients: one patient with extensive metastatic bone and bone marrow disease during the first visit, one patient with his fifth recurrence during 15 years, one patient with extensive metastatic disease in liver, one patient with multiple lung metastases, one patient with metastatic disease where Lu-177-PSMA was used as first-line treatment and one patient with extensive metastatic disease in the lymphatics and skeleton. All these patients were treated with Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy with major response, i.e. major (up to complete) response by imaging and substantial (> 90%) reduction of PSA. Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy gave only mild adverse effects. In conclusion, in patients with metastatic prostate cancer, Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy had an attractive therapeutic profile, showing efficacy in the prostate, in lymph nodes, in lungs, in the liver and also in bones. The therapy had to be adjusted according to the patients' needs.

In the present study,a novel reversible fluorine-18 labeled MAO-B compound, [F-18]GEH200449, was evaluated as a PET radioligand in non-human primates.PET studies of [F-18]GEH200449 at baseline showed brainexposure (maximum concentration: 3.4-5.2 SUV; n = 5) within the range of that for suitable central nervous systemradioligands and a regional distribution consistent with the knownlocalization of MAO-B. Based on the quantitative assessment of [F-18]GEH200449 data using the metabolite-corrected arterialplasma concentration as input function, the Logan graphical analysiswas selected as the preferred method of quantification. The bindingof [F-18]GEH200449, as calculated based on regional estimatesof the total distribution volume, was markedly inhibited (occupancy>80%) by the administration of the selective MAO-B ligands L-deprenyl (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg) or rasagiline (0.75 mg/kg)prior to radioligand injection. Radioligand binding was displaceableby the administration of L-deprenyl (0.5 mg/kg) at25 min after radioligand injection, thus supporting reversible bindingto MAO-B. These observations support that [F-18]GEH200449is a reversible MAO-B radioligand suitable for applied studies inhumans.

Human dopamine receptors hD1 and hD2L (representing G(s) [hD1] or G [hD2L] coupled GPCRs) were recombinantly expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Cells were loaded with Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1/AM and evenly distributed in 384 well plates. Seventeen test compounds were screened for agonistic activity by injection into the cell suspension and monitoringH of intracellular Ca2+ with a fluorescence microplate reader. Then, standard agonists (100nM SKF38393 for hD1, 30nM quinpirole for hD2L) were injected into wells preincubated with test compounds (screening for antagonism). Injection of various agonists resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in fluorescence. Further, preincubation of antagonists with dopamine receptor expressing cells inhibits concentrationdependent the agonist-induced increase in fluorescence. Calculated apparent functional K-i values correlate with radioligand binding data in the literature ( = 0.7796 for D1, = 0.7743 for D2). The correlation between apparent functional K values and radioligand binding data for the 17 tested compounds suggests that screening of test compounds at dopamine receptors with the functional Ca2+ assay can replace radioligand binding studies. Furthermore, besides apparent K values, information about agonistic or antagonistic properties of a test compound can be obtained with the functional Ca2+ assay.

Selective localization of oxytocin receptors and vasopressin 1a receptors in the human brainstem	SOCIAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Brainstem; receptor autoradiography; neuropeptides; spinal trigeminal nucleus; nucleus prepositus	UPPER SPINAL-CORD; BINDING-SITES; MESSENGER-RNA; MONTANE VOLES; NEUROANATOMICAL DISTRIBUTION; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; RAT-BRAIN; PRAIRIE; LIGAND; AUTORADIOGRAPHY	Intranasal oxytocin (OT) affects a suite of human social behaviors, including trust, eye contact, and emotion recognition. However, it is unclear where oxytocin receptors (OXTR) and the structurally related vasopressin 1a receptors (AVPR1a) are expressed in the human brain. We have previously described a reliable, pharmacologically informed receptor autoradiography protocol for visualizing these receptors in postmortem primate brain tissue. We used this technique in human brainstem tissue to identify the neural targets of OT and vasopressin. To determine binding selectivity of the OXTR radioligand and AVPR1a radioligand, sections were incubated in four conditions: radioligand alone, radioligand with the selective AVPR1a competitor SR49059, and radioligand with a low or high concentration of the selective OXTR competitor ALS-II-69. We found selective OXTR binding in the spinal trigeminal nucleus, a conserved region of OXTR expression in all primate species investigated to date. We found selective AVPR1a binding in the nucleus prepositus, an area implicated in eye gaze stabilization. The tissue's postmortem interval (PMI) was not correlated with either the specific or nonspecific binding of either radioligand, indicating that it will not likely be a factor in similar postmortem studies. This study provides critical data for future studies of OXTR and AVPR1a in human brain tissue.

The method is based on the specific binding of a radioligand to its biological target. Therefore, frozen tissue sections are incubated with radioligand solution, and the binding to the target is subsequently localized by the detection of radioactive decay, for example, by using photosensitive film or phosphor imaging plates. Resulting digital autoradiograms display remarkable spatial resolution, which enables quantification and localization of radioligand binding in distinct anatomical structures. Moreover, quantification allows for the pharmacological characterization of ligand affinity by means of dissociation constants (K-d), inhibition constants (K-i) as well as the density of binding sites (B-max) in selected tissues. Thus, the method provides information about both target localization and ligand selectivity. Here, the technique is exemplified with autoradiographic characterization of the high-affinity gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) binding sites in mammalian brain tissue, with special emphasis on methodological considerations regarding the binding assay parameters, the choice of the radioligand and the detection method.

Tritium-labeled agonists as tools for studying adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> receptors	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Adenosine A(2B) receptor; Agonist radioligand; [H-3]BAY 60-6583; [H-3]NECA; Kinetics; Radioligand binding	SELECTIVE ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; A(2A) RECEPTOR; BINDING; AFFINITY; RAT; MEMBRANE; PROTEIN; A(1); DETERMINANTS	A selective agonist radioligand for A(2B) adenosine receptors (A(2B)ARs) is currently not available. Such a tool would be useful for labeling the active conformation of the receptors. Therefore, we prepared BAY 60-6583, a potent and functionally selective A(2B)AR (partial) agonist, in a tritium-labeled form. Despite extensive efforts, however, we have not been able to establish a radioligand binding assay using [H-3]BAY 60-6583. This is probably due to its high non-specific binding and its moderate affinity, which had previously been overestimated based on functional data. As an alternative, we evaluated the non-selective A(2B)AR agonist [H-3]NECA for its potential to label A(2B)ARs. [H-3]NECA showed specific, saturable, and reversible binding to membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells stably expressing human, rat, or mouse A(2B)ARs. In competition binding experiments, the AR agonists 2-chloroadenosine (CADO) and NECA displayed significantly higher affinity when tested versus [H-3]NECA than versus the A(2B)-antagonist radioligand [H-3]PSB-603 while structurally diverse AR antagonists showed the opposite effects. Although BAY 60-6583 is an A(2B)AR agonist, it displayed higher affinity versus [H-3]PSB-603 than versus [H-3]NECA. These results indicate that nucleoside and non-nucleoside agonists are binding to very different conformations of the A(2B)AR. In conclusion, [H-3]NECA is currently the only useful radioligand for determining the affinity of ligands for an active A(2B)AR conformation.

While synaptic NMDARs are thought to have protective characteristics, activation of extrasynaptic NMDARs might trigger excitotoxic processes linked to neuropsychiatric disorders. Since extrasynaptic NMDARs are typically GluN2B-enriched, the subunit is an interesting target for drug development and treatment monitoring. Recently, the novel GluN2B-specific PET radioligand (R)-[C-11]Me-NB1 was investigated in rodents and for the first time successfully translated to humans. To assess whether (R)-[C-11]Me-NB1 is a valuable radioligand for (repeated) clinical applications, we evaluated its safety, biodistribution and dosimetry. Methods: Four healthy subjects (two females, two males) underwent one whole-body PET/MR measurement lasting for more than 120 min. The GluN2B-specific radioligand (R)-[C-11]Me-NB1 was administered simultaneously with the PET start. Subjects were measured in nine passes and six bed positions from head to mid-thigh. Regions of interest was anatomically defined for the brain, thyroid, lungs, heart wall, spleen, stomach contents, pancreas, liver, kidneys, bone marrow and urinary bladder contents, using both PET and MR images. Time-integrated activity coefficients were estimated to calculate organ equivalent dose coefficients and the effective dose coefficient. Additionally, standardized uptake values (SUV) were computed to visualize the biodistribution. Results: Administration of the radioligand was safe without adverse events. The organs with the highest uptake were the urinary bladder, spleen and pancreas. Organ equivalent dose coefficients were higher in female in almost all organs, except for the urinary bladder of male. The effective dose coefficient was 6.0 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusion: The GluN2B-specific radioligand (R)-[C-11]Me-NB1 was well-tolerated without reported side effects. Effective dose was estimated to 1.8 mSv when using 300 MBq of presented radioligand. The critical organ was the urinary bladder. Due to the low effective dose coefficient of this radioligand, longitudinal studies for drug development and treatment monitoring of neuropsychiatric disorders including neurodegenerative diseases are possible.

Positron emission tomography (PET) is used to study several serotonin receptors in CNS in vivo. The G-protein coupled receptor 5-HT1B is mostly present in the occipital cortex and in midbrain and is linked to several psychiatric disorders. There is evidence that agonist PET radioligands for neuroreceptors are more sensitive to endogenous neurotransmitters than antagonists. Our previously developed 5-HT1B receptor PET radioligand, [C-11]AZ10419369, is now considered a partial agonist. In this work we are aiming to develop a full antagonist PET radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT1B receptors, and evaluate its sensitivity to increased endogenous serotonin concentration. 'Materials: [C-11]A210419096 was synthesized by rapid methylation of the prepared corresponding N-desmethyl precursor with [C-11]methyl triflate. Five PET measurements were performed in cynomolgus monkeys, consisting of two at baseline, one after treatment of a monkey with a 5-HT1B antagonist, AR-A000002, and two in which fenfluramine was administered during scanning to induce endogenous serotonin release. Results and discussion: [C-11]AZ10419096 was synthesized in high yield and purity within 30 min, including purification, formulation and sterile filtration. The baseline PET measurements demonstrated [C-11]AZ10419096 to have favorable radioligand characteristics, including high specific binding in brain regions that have high 5-HT1B density, such as occipital cortex and globus pallidus, as well as subsequent rapid elimination from brain and a minor abundance of lipophilic radiometabolites in plasma. AR-A00002 completely blocked radioligand receptor-specific binding. Fenfluramine produced a distinct displacement of radioligand consistent with an expected increase of synaptic endogenous serotonin concentration. Conclusions: [C-11]AZ10419096, a full 5-HT1B antagonist PET radioligand, demonstrates high specific binding in monkey brain that is sensitive to competition from a known 5-HT1B antagonist as well as to putatively increased endogenous serotonin levels.

Fenfluramine Reduces [<SUP>11</SUP>C] Cimbi-36 Binding to the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> Receptor in the Nonhuman Primate Brain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						[C-11] Cimbi-36; [C-11] AZ10419369; [C-11] MDL 100907; fenfluramine; serotonin	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; TEST-RETEST REPRODUCIBILITY; IN-VIVO; SEROTONIN RELEASE; AGONIST BINDING; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; TERNARY COMPLEX; PET; ANTAGONIST	Background: [C-11] Cimbi-36 is a serotonin 2A receptor agonist positron emission tomography radioligand that has recently been examined in humans. The binding of agonist radioligand is expected to be more sensitive to endogenous neurotransmitter concentrations than antagonist radioligands. In the current study, we compared the effect of serotonin releaser fenfluramine on the binding of [C-11] Cimbi-36, [C-11] MDL 100907 (a serotonin 2A receptor antagonist radioligand), and [C-11] AZ10419369 (a serotonin 1B receptor partial agonist radioligand with established serotonin sensitivity) in the monkey brain. Methods: Eighteen positron emission tomography measurements, 6 for each radioligand, were performed in 3 rhesus monkeys before or after administration of 5.0 mg/kg fenfluramine. Binding potential values were determined with the simplified reference tissue model using cerebellum as the reference region. Results: Fenfluramine significantly decreased [C-11] Cimbi-36 (26-62%) and [C-11] AZ10419369 (35-58%) binding potential values in most regions (P < 0.05). Fenfluramine-induced decreases in [C-11] MDL 100907 binding potential were 8% to 30% and statistically significant in 3 regions. Decreases in [C-11] Cimbi-36 binding potential were larger than for [C-11] AZ10419369 in neocortical and limbic regions (similar to 35%) but smaller in striatum and thalamus (similar to 40%). Decreases in [C-11] Cimbi-36 binding potential were 0.9 to 2.8 times larger than for [C-11] MDL 100907, and the fraction of serotonin 2A receptor in the high-affinity state was estimated as 54% in the neocortex. Conclusions: The serotonin sensitivity of serotonin 2A receptor agonist radioligand [C-11] Cimbi-36 was higher than for antagonist radioligand [C-11] MDL 100907. The serotonin sensitivity of [11C] Cimbi-36 was similar to [C-11] AZ10419369, which is one of the most sensitive radioligands. [C-11] Cimbi-36 is a promising radioligand to examine serotonin release in the primate brain.

This novel approach afforded the radioligand with > 97% radiochemical purity and a high chemical purity (nitromazenil content < 1 mu g mL(-1)) and considerably reduced the time of the synthesis (from 90 to 50 min). The nonoptimized decay-corrected radiochemical yield was 8%, and the specific radioactivity was > 37 GBq mu mol(-1). The novel synthetic procedure easily can be integrated into automatic modules for the synthesis of clinically used PET radiopharmaceuticals.

Today, its biochemical identification and pharmacological characterization, as well as the screening of thousands of novel ligands that might be useful for developing CB1-based therapies, are the subject of intense research. Among available techniques that allow the analysis of CB1 binding activity, radioligand-based assays represent one of the best, fast, and reliable methods. Here, we describe radioligand binding methods standardized in our laboratory to assess CB1 binding in both tissues and cultured cells. We also report a high-throughput radioligand binding assay that allows to evaluate efficacy and potency of different compounds, which might represent the basis for the development of new drugs that target CB1 receptor-dependent human diseases.

The radioligand [C-11]KR31173 has been introduced for PET imaging of the angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT1R). The purpose of the present project was to employ and validate a compartmental model for quantification of the kinetics of this radioligand in a porcine model of renal ischemia followed by reperfusion (IR). Procedures. Ten domestic pigs were included in the study: five controls and five experimental animals with IR of the left kidney. To achieve IR, acute ischemia was created with a balloon inserted into the left renal artery and inflated for 60 minutes. Reperfusion was achieved by deflation and removal of the balloon. Blood chemistries, urine specific gravity and PH values, and circulating hormones of the renin angiotensin system were measured and PET imaging was performed one week after IR. Cortical time-activity curves obtained from a 90 min [C-11]KR31173 dynamic PET study were processed with a compartmental model that included two tissue compartments connected in parallel. Radioligand binding quantified by radioligand retention (80 min value to maximum value ratio) was compared to the binding parameters derived from the compartmental model. A binding ratio was calculated as DVR = DVs/DVNS, where DVS and DVNS represented the distribution volumes of specific binding and nonspecific binding. Receptor binding was also determined by autoradiography in vitro. Results. Correlations between rate constants and binding parameters derived by the convolution and deconvolution curve fittings were significant (r > 0.9). Also significant was the correlation between the retention parameter derived from the tissue activity curve (Y-ret) and the retention parameter derived from the impulse response function (f(ret)). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between these two retention parameters and DVR. Measurements with PET showed no significant changes in the radioligand binding parameters caused by IR, and these in vivo findings were confirmed by autoradiography performed in vitro. Conclusions. Correlations between various binding parameters support the concept of the parallel connectivity compartmental model. If an arterial input function cannot be obtained, simple radioligand retention may be adequate for estimation of in vivo radioligand binding.	[Gulaldi, Nedim C.

Methods: The performance of Varelisa and LKM1 enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was compared with immunofluorescence, and two validated research techniques-on in house ELISA and a radioligand assay measuring antibodies to P4502D6. Thirty serum samples from three patients with autoimmune hepatitis type 2 covering immunofluorescence fitres of 1/10 to 1/10 240 and 55 LKM1 negative controls were tested. Results: All 30 sera that were LKM1 positive by immunofluorescence were positive by the in house ELISA, the radioligand assay, and LKM1-ELISA, and 29 were also positive by Varelisa. None of the 55 sera negative for LKM1 by immunofluorescence was positive by the in house ELISA and radioligand assay, but one was positive by Varelisa and 14 were positive using the LKM1-ELISA. Agreement between immunofluorescence, the in house ELISA, the radioligand assay, and Varelisa was high (kappa > 0.8), and agreement between immunofluorescence and LKM1-ELISA was moderate (kappa = 0.63). Conclusion: The assay kit marketed as Vareliso allows accurate detection of LKM1.

Compared with results by Western blotting, three and nine sera were concordantly positive, respectively. The four sera showing the highest levels of antibodies by radioligand assay were all negative by Western blotting; however, dilution and inhibition tests supported the positive results. Our results suggest the importance of conformational structure to detect human anti-Borna disease virus antibodies.

PET images were acquired dynamically for 1 hour after intravenously (i.v.) injecting 37 MBq (1.0 mCi) of the radioligand into the woodchuck model of naturally occurring HCC. Woodchuck HCC originated from chronic viral hepatitis infection, which recapitulates the corresponding human primary liver cancer. The animals were euthanized post-imaging for tissue collection and validation.Results: For ZD2 avid liver tumors, the radioligand accumulation plateaued a few minutes after injection, while the liver background uptake stabilized 20 min post-injection. The status of EDB-FN in woodchuck HCC was confirmed by histology and validated by PCR and western blocking.Conclusion: We have showed the viability of using the ZD2 short peptide radioligand targeting EDB-FN in liver tumor tissue for PET imaging of HCC, which can potentially impact the clinical care for HCC patients.

In this study, we aimed at the development of a novel F-18-labeled radioligand starting from the structure of the known naphthyrid-2-one CB2R ligands. Compound 28 (LU13) was identified with the highest binding affinity and selectivity versus CB1R (CB2RK(i) = 0.6 nM; CB1RKi/CB2RKi > 1000) and was selected for radiolabeling with fluorine-18 and biological characterization. The new radioligand [F-18]LU13 showed high CB2R affinity in vitro as well as high metabolic stability in vivo. PET imaging with [F-18]LU13 in a rat model of vector-based/-related hCB2R overexpression in the striatum revealed a high signal-to-background ratio. Thus, [F-18]LU13 is a novel and highly promising PET radioligand for the imaging of upregulated CB2R expression under pathological conditions in the brain.

Specific [H-3]5-HMT binding in rat tissues was saturable and of high affinity in each tissue. The dissociation constant (K-d) was significantly lower in bladder and heart than in submaxillary gland. Significant levels of in vivo specific [H-3]5-HMT binding by intravenous injection of the radioligand were detected in tissues, except for cerebral cortex. Thus, [H-3]5-HMT was shown to specifically label muscarinic receptors in rat tissues, suggesting a useful radioligand for labeling muscarinic receptors with high affinity. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Determination of receptor occupancy in the presence of mass dose: [<SUP>11</SUP>C]GSK189254 PET imaging of histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor occupancy by PF-03654746	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Mathematical modeling; kinetic modeling; pharmacokinetics; positron emission tomography; receptor imaging	IN-VIVO; D2 RECEPTORS; BRAIN; BINDING; HUMANS; ANTAGONISTS; AFFINITY; RADIOLIGAND; INHIBITION; MODELS	Measurements of drug occupancies using positron emission tomography (PET) can be biased if the radioligand concentration exceeds tracer levels. Negative bias would also arise in successive PET scans if clearance of the radioligand is slow, resulting in a carryover effect. We developed a method to (1) estimate the invivo dissociation constant K-d of a radioligand from PET studies displaying a non-tracer carryover (NTCO) effect and (2) correct the NTCO bias in occupancy studies taking into account the plasma concentration of the radioligand and its invivo K-d. This method was applied in a study of healthy human subjects with the histamine H-3 receptor radioligand [C-11]GSK189254 to measure the PK-occupancy relationship of the H-3 antagonist PF-03654746. From three test/retest studies, [C-11]GSK189254 K-d was estimated to be 9.5 +/- 5.9pM. Oral administration of 0.1 to 4mg of PF-03654746 resulted in occupancy estimates of 71%-97% and 30%-93% at 3 and 24h post-drug, respectively. NTCO correction adjusted the occupancy estimates by 0%-15%. Analysis of the relationship between corrected occupancies and PF-03654746 plasma levels indicated that PF-03654746 can fully occupy H-3 binding sites (ROmax=100%), and its IC50 was estimated to be 0.144 +/- 0.010ng/mL. The uncorrected IC50 was 26% higher.

J	Liu, JW; Zacco, A; Piser, TM; Scott, CW				Liu, JW; Zacco, A; Piser, TM; Scott, CW			Microplate gel-filtration method for radioligand-binding assays	ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						gel filtration; radioligand binding; equilibrium constants; estrogen receptor; binding proteins	ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-ALPHA; HORMONE-BINDING; LIGAND; BETA	A thin-layer gel-filtration chromatographic method has been developed in a 96-well format to separate free and protein-bound ligand in radioligand-binding assays. The mobile phase in the gel-filtration plate is removed via quick centrifugation before samples are applied. Protein-bound ligand is recovered via centrifugation into another 96-well plate for radioactivity measurements. The method exhibits excellent recovery of protein-ligand complexes and less opportunity for dissociation of the complexes since it eliminates major dilution effects from the mobile phase of a column and from elution steps in conventional gel-filtration chromatography. It offers other advantages: simple, rapid, inexpensive, quantitative, and able to handle a large number of samples as required in drug discovery and clinical settings. This microplate gel-filtration method was optimized in studies of receptor-ligand interactions using estrogen receptors as examples and can be used in other radioligand-binding assays.

Synthesis and Evaluation in Monkey of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]4-Fluoro-N-methyl-<i>N</i>-(4-(6-(methylannino)pyrimidin-4-yl)thiazol-2-yl)benzamide ([<SUP>18</SUP>F]FIMX): A Promising Radioligand for PET Imaging of Brain Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 (mGluR1)	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO; DIARYLIODONIUM TOSYLATES; EXTRUSION REACTIONS; R2I-F IODINE(III); FREE-FRACTION; AB-INITIO; RADIOFLUORINATION; LIGAND; RAT; RADIOSYNTHESIS	We sought to develop a PET radioligand that would be useful for imaging human brain metabotropic subtype 1 receptors (mGluR1) in neuropsychiatric disorders and in drug development. 4-Fluoro-N-methyl-N-(4-(6(methylamino)pyrimidin-4-yOthiazol-2-ylbenzamide (FIMX, 11) was identified as having favorable properties for development as a PET radioligand. We developed a method for preparing [F-18]11 in useful radiochemical yield and in high specific activity from [18F]fluoride ion and an N-Boc-protected (phenyl)aryliodonium salt precursor (15). In baseline experiments in rhesus monkey, [F-18 ]11 gave high brain radioactivity uptake, reflecting the expected distribution of mGluR1 with notably high uptake in cerebellum, which became 47% lower by 120 min after radioligand injection. Pharmacological challenges demonstrated that a very high proportion of the radioactivity in monkey brain was bound specifically and reversibly to mGluRl. [F-18]11 is concluded to be an effective PET radioligand for imaging mGluR1 in monkey brain and therefore merits further evaluation in human subjects.

Prior to this publication, the biodistribution of ERGO has been performed solely in vitro using extracted tissues. The aim of this study was to develop a feasible chemistry for the synthesis of an ERGO PET radioligand, [C-11]ERGO, to facilitate in vivo study. The radioligand probe was synthesized with identical structure to ERGO by employing an orthogonal protection/deprotection approach. [C-11]methylation of the precursor was performed via [C-11]CH3OTf to provide [C-11]ERGO radioligand. The [C-11]ERGO was isolated by RP-HPLC with a molar activity of 690 TBq/mmol. To demonstrate the biodistribution of the radioligand, we administered approximately 37 MBq/0.1 mL in 5XFAD mice, a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via the tail vein. The distribution of ERGO in the brain was monitored using 90-min dynamic PET scans. The delivery and specific retention of [C-11]ERGO in an LPS-mediated neuroinflammation mouse model was also demonstrated. For the pharmacokinetic study, the concentration of the compound in the serum started to decrease 10 min after injection while starting to distribute in other peripheral tissues. In particular, a significant amount of the compound was found in the eyes and small intestine. The radioligand was also distributed in several regions of the brain of 5XFAD mice, and the signal remained strong 30 min post-injection. This is the first time the biodistribution of this antioxidant and rare amino acid has been demonstrated in a preclinical mouse model in a highly sensitive and non-invasive manner.

Application at α<sub>2A</sub>- and α<sub>2C</sub>-adrenoceptors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Spiroxatrine; MK912; Off-rate; Residence time; [3H]-RX821002; Kinetics	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; DISSOCIATION RATE; DRUG-ACTION; ASSOCIATION; ANTAGONISTS; MECHANISMS; COMPLEXES; POINT; MK912	Kinetic on and off rate constants for many receptor ligands are difficult to determine with regular radioligand binding technique since only few of the ligands are available in labeled form. Here we developed a new and simple radioligand binding method for determining the kinetic off-rate constant for unlabeled ligands, using whole cells expressing alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors. The new method involves pre-incubation with unlabeled ligand, centrifugation of microtiter plates in order to adhere the cells to the bottom surface, and then upside-down centrifugation of the plates for few seconds to wash away the non-bound fraction of the pre-incubated ligand. The final on-reaction assay for the radioligand is then started by quick addition of a relatively fast-associating radioligand to the cells. The curve obtained is defined by a fairly simple mathematical formula that reflects the simultaneous dissociation of pre-incubated ligand and association of the radioligand. The method proved to produce highly reproducible results in determining the k(off) constants for various unlabeled ligands. The results show that the alpha(2C)-selectivity of MK912 depends mainly on a very slow off-rate at the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor subtype. Regarding the markedly alpha(2C)- over alpha(2A)-selective compound spiroxatrine, its much faster on-rate at alpha(2C)- than alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors explains much of its exceptional alpha(2C)-selectivity. Several new techniques for determining the kinetic component of ligand-receptor interactions at molecular level are currently developing. As a reference, based on standard radioligand binding techniques, the present study describes a simple and robust experimental and mathematical procedure for determining k(off) constants of unlabeled drugs.

Safety of High-Dose Botulinum Toxin Injections for Parotid and Submandibular Gland Radioprotection	TOXINS			English	Article						high-dose botulinum toxin; salivary glands; radioprotection		Botulinum Toxin injections into salivary glands (SG) up to a total dose of 100 units IncobotulinumtoxinA (IncoA) represent the treatment of choice for sialorrhea. However, BTX might also protect SG against sialotoxic radioligand cancer therapies. The radioligand Actinium-225-PSMA effectively targets Prostate Cancer (PCa) metastases but inevitably destroys SG due to unintended gland uptake. A preliminary case series with regular-dose IncoA failed to reduce SG PSMA-radioligand uptake. We therefore increased IncoA dosage in combination with transdermal scopolamine until a clinically relevant SG PSMA-radioligand uptake reduction was achieved. Ten consecutive men with metastasized PCa refractory to all other cancer therapies received gradually increasing IncoA dosages as part of a compassionate use PSMA-radioligand-therapy trial. The parotid gland received six and the submandibular gland three injection points under ultrasound control, up to a maximum of 30 units IncoA per injection point. A maximum total dose of 250 units IncoA was applied with up to 170 units per parotid and 80 units per submandibular gland. Treatment was well tolerated and all side-effects were non-serious. The most frequent side-effect was dry mouth of mild severity. No dysphagia, facial weakness, chewing difficulties or systemic side-effects were observed. SG injections with IncoA up to a total dose of 250 units are safe when distributed among several injection-points under ultrasound control by an experienced physician. These preliminary findings lay the basis for future trials including BTX as major component for SG protection in established as well as newly emerging radioligand cancer therapies.

Consequently, intense efforts are dedicated to the development of selective A(3) agonists and antagonists. The only tritiated agonist that is available for radioligand binding is the nonselective [H-3]5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine ([H-3]NECA). Based on a recently characterized series of 2-substituted adenosine receptor agonists we developed a tritiated selective A(3) radioligand with high affinity. From this series 2-hexyn-1-yl-N 6 -methyladenosine (HEMADO) with a K-i-value of 1. 1 nM at the human A(3) subtype was chosen. HEMADO is 300-fold selective versus the A(1) subtype, and 1100-fold and more than 25,000-fold selective compared to the adenosine A(2A) and A(2B) receptors, respectively. The tritiated derivative [H-3]HEMADO exhibited the same affinity as the unlabeled precursor. In concentrations up to 10 nM no specific binding to adenosine A(1), A(2A) or A(2B) receptors was observed confirming the high selectivity for adenosine A(3) receptors. Characterization of [H-3]HEMADO in radioligand binding studies revealed reversible binding to the human adenosine A(3) subtype. In saturation binding studies for the A(3) subtype a KD-value of 1. 1 nM was determined. Nonspecific binding at a radioligand concentration of I nM amounted to 1-2% of total binding. Competition binding with a panel of adenosine receptor ligands clearly confirmed the correct A3 pharmacology of the binding site labeled by [H-3]HEMADO. With [H-3]HEMADO we present a tritiated agonist with high affinity and A3-selectivity and very low nonspecific binding. [H-3]HEMADO is a useful tool for specific screening for A(3) receptor agonists and antagonists in improved radioligand binding assays with the human subtype. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluation of <SUP>11</SUP>C-BU99008, a PET Ligand for the Imidazoline<sub>2</sub> Binding Sites in Rhesus Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						imidazoline(2) binding site; I2BS; positron emission tomography; PET; BU99008	RECEPTOR-LIGAND; IN-VITRO; DENSITY	The development of a PET radioligand selective for I-2-imidazoline binding sites (I2BS) would enable, for the first time, specific, measurable in vivo imaging of this target protein, along with assessment of alterations in expression patterns of this protein in disease pathophysiology. Methods: BU99008 was identified as the most promising I2BS radioligand candidate and radiolabeled with C-11 via methylation. The in vivo binding properties of C-11-BU99008 were assessed in rhesus monkeys to determine brain penetration, brain distribution, binding specificity and selectivity (via the use of the unlabeled blockers), and the most appropriate kinetic model for analyzing data generated with this PET radioligand. Results: C-11-BU99008 was demonstrated to readily enter the brain, resulting in a heterogeneous distribution (globus pallidus. cortical regions. cerebellum) consistent with the reported regional I2BS densities as determined by human tissue section autoradiography and preclinical in vivo PET studies in the pig. In vivo competition studies revealed that C-11-BU99008 displayed reversible kinetics specific for the I2BS. The multilinear analysis (MA1) model was the most appropriate analysis method for this PET radioligand in this species. The selective I2BS blocker BU224 was shown to cause a saturable, dose-dependent decrease in C-11-BU99008 binding in all regions of the brain assessed, further demonstrating the heterogeneous distribution of I2BS protein in the rhesus brain and binding specificity for this radioligand. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that C-11-BU99008 represents a specific and selective PET radioligand for imaging and quantifying the I2BS, in vivo, in the rhesusmonkey. Further work is under way to translate the use of C-11-BU99008 to the clinic.

The molar radioactivity was 115 GBq/mu mol and the radiochemical purity was greater than 95.5%. Its affinity and selectivity for dopamine D-2-like receptors were measured through in vitro receptor binding experiments and the K-i for D-4 receptor was determined to be 17 +/- 0.5 nM. The partition coefficient (Log P) of it was determined to be 2.80 +/- 0.10 through octanol experiment. The in vivo biodistribution of it in rat brain exposed that the radioligand penetrates through blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and may specifically bind to dopamine D-4 receptor. The results indicated that the radioligand shows promise for the in vivo study of dopamine D-4 receptor.

Among the studied compounds, (R)-1-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)phenyllpiperazin-1-yl]-3-(2-pyrazinyloxy)-2-propanol ((R)-16), showed the best combination of affinity, selectivity, and lipophilicity, and was thus chosen for carbon-11 labelling and evaluation in pigs. After intravenous injection, [C-11](R)-16 entered the pig brain and displayed reversible tracer kinetics. Pretreatment with the 5-HT7 receptor selective antagonist SB-269970 (1) resulted in limited decrease in the binding of [11C](R)-16, suggesting that this radioligand is not optimal for imaging the brain 5-HT7 receptor in vivo but it may serve as a lead compound for the design of novel 5-HT7 receptor PET radioligands.

The unbound PET radioligand was first analyzed by high-performance frontal analysis using a short gel-filtration column and phosphate buffered saline solution as the mobile phase. All the collected effluent from the gel-filtration column was then transferred to the second dimension consisting of a monolithic C-18 column and mixed (anionic and nonionic surfactants) micellar eluent for determination of the total PET radioligand concentration. The simultaneous analysis of protein binding and radiometabolism of [C-11]PBR28 was completed within 11 min without any pretreatment of plasma and employing a single analytical system. This system allowed highly sensitive analysis of total [C-11]PBR28 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.6 becquerel (Bq). The LOD for the determination of unbound [C-11]PBR28 was 21 Bq. Finally, simultaneous measurements of protein binding and radiometabolism of [C-11]PBR28 in human plasma were achieved for up to 50 min after radioligand administration.

In addition, such a tool would assist in the development of novel drugs targeting the 5-HT6 receptor. Methods: On the basis of in vitro data, GSK215083 was identified as a promising 5-HT6 radioligand candidate and was radiolabeled with C-11 via methylation. The in vivo properties of C-11-GSK215083 were evaluated first in pigs (to investigate brain penetration and specific binding), second in nonhuman primates (to confirm brain penetration, specific binding, selectivity, and kinetics), and third in human subjects (to confirm brain penetration and biodistribution). Results: C-11-GSK215083 readily entered the brain in all 3 species, leading to a heterogeneous distribution (striatum > cortex > cerebellum) consistent with reported 5-HT6 receptor densities and distribution determined by tissue-section autoradiography in preclinical species and humans. In vivo saturation studies using escalating doses of GSK215083 in primates demonstrated saturable, dose-dependent binding to the 5-HT6 receptor in the striatum. Importantly, C-11-GSK215083 also exhibited affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor; however, given the differential localization of these 2 receptors in the central nervous system, the discrete 5-HT6 binding properties of this radioligand were able to be determined. Conclusion: These data demonstrate the utility of C-11-GSK215083 as a promising PET radioligand for probing the 5-HT6 receptor in vivo in both preclinical and clinical species.

FP assays were shown to work across a range of both peptide (vasopressin V-1a and delta-opioid) and nonpeptide (beta(1)-adrenoceptor, 5-hydroxytryptamine(3)) receptors, Structure-activity relationships were investigated at beta(1)-receptors and were found to be consistent with radioligand binding assays. FP was shown to tolerate up to 5% DMSO with no loss in sensitivity or signal window. From a random set of 1,280 compounds, 1.9% were found to significantly interfere with FP measurement. If fluorescent or quenching compounds were eliminated (3% of ail compounds), less than 0.4% of compounds were found to interfere with FP measurement. Assays could be run in 384-well plates with little loss of signal window or sensitivity compared to 96-well plate assays, New advances in FP measurement have therefore enabled FP to offer a high throughput alternative to radioligand binding for cell surface receptors.

Among theligand tools available are selective agonists and antagonists,including radioligands, but most high-affinity non-nucleosideantagonists are limited in selectivity to primate species. We haveexplored the structure-activity relationship of a previouslyreported A3AR antagonist DPTN9(N-[4-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]nicotinamide) for radiolabeling, in-cluding 3-halo derivatives (3-iodo, MRS7907), and characterized9as a high -affinity radioligand [3H]MRS7799. A3ARKdvalues were(nM): 0.55 (human), 3.74 (mouse), and 2.80 (rat).

Using positron emission tomography, accurate measurements of the time course of radioligand uptake and clearance can be obtained. A tracer kinetic model is needed to derive physiological or pharmacokinetic parameters from these tissue time-activity curves. In addition, an input function that indicates delivery to the tissue is required. Usually this will be the arterial plasma curve. For receptor studies, where binding potential is the parameter of interest, it might also be possible to avoid arterial sampling provided a tissue can be defined that is devoid of receptors.

In modern biochemistry, these approaches have largely been superseded by site-directed mutagenesis in the study of protein function, owing in part to a better understanding of the chemical properties of oligonucleotides and to the ease with which mutant clones can now be generated. The Altered Sites II(R) in vitro Mutagenesis System from the Promega Corporation employs oligonucleotides containing two mismatches to introduce specific nucleotide substitutions in the nucleic acid sequence of a target DNA. One of these mismatches will alter the primary sequence of a given protein, whereas the second will give rise to a silent restriction site that is used to screen for mutants. Transient transfection of tsA201 cells with mutant cDNA constructs using calcium phosphate as a carrier for plasmid DNA permits expression of recombinant receptors that can be characterized using radioligand binding assays. In this article, we focus on site-directed mutagenesis, heterologous expression in eukaryotic cells, and radioligand binding as a methodology to enable the characterization of receptor-ligand interactions.

Methods: The cell membrane stationary phase (CMSP) was prepared by immobilizing guinea pig jejunum cell membrane on the surface of a silica carrier, and was used for the rapid on-line chromatographic evaluation of ligand binding affinities to mAChR. The affinity to mAChR was also evaluated from radioligand binding assays (RBA) using the same jejunum membrane preparation. Results: The capacity factor (V) profiles in guinea pig jejunum CMSP were: (-)QNB (15.4)>(+)QNB (11.5)>atropine (5.35)>pirenzepine (5.26)>4-DAMP (4.45)>AF-DX116 (4.18)>pilocarpine (3.93)>acetylcholine (1.31). These results compared with the affinity rank orders obtained from radioligand binding assays indicated that there was a positive correlation (r(2)= 0.8525, P<0.0001) between both data sets. Conclusion: The CMC method can be used to evaluate drug-receptor affinities for drug candidates.

D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptor internalization prolongs the decrease of radioligand binding after amphetamine: A PET study in a receptor internalization-deficient mouse model	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						[C-11]MNPA; [F-18]fallypride; Dopamine receptor; Internalization; Arrestin3; PET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NONHUMAN PRIMATE BRAIN; HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; AGONIST RADIOTRACER; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; G-PROTEIN; EX-VIVO; BETA-ARRESTIN-2; RADIOSYNTHESIS; TRAFFICKING	Dopamine released by amphetamine decreases the in vivo binding of PET radioligands to the dopamine D-2 receptor. Although concentrations of extracellular dopamine largely return to baseline within 1 to 2 h after amphetamine treatment, radioligand binding remains decreased for several hours. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the prolonged decrease of radioligand binding after amphetamine administration is caused by receptor internalization. To distinguish dopamine displacement from receptor internalization, we used wild-type and arrestin3 (arr3) knockout mice, which are incapable of internalizing D-2 receptors. In addition, we used both the D-2 selective agonist [C-11]MNPA (which is thought to bind to the high affinity state of the receptor) and the D-2 selective antagonist [F-18]fallypride (which does not differentiate between high and low affinity state). After an initial baseline scan, animals were divided in three groups for a second scan: either 30 min or 4 h after amphetamine administration (3 mg/kg, i.p.) or as retest. At 30 min, [C-11]MNPA showed greater displacement than [F-18]fallypride, but each radioligand gave similar displacement in knockout and wild-type mice. At 4 h, the binding of both radioligands returned to baseline in arr3 knockout mice, but remained decreased in wild-type mice. Radioligand binding was unaltered on retest scanning. Our results suggest that the prolonged decrease of radioligand binding after amphetamine is mainly due to internalization of the D-2 receptor rather than dopamine displacement. In addition, this study demonstrates the utility of small animal PET to study receptor trafficking in vivo in genetically modified mice. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Other mGlu5 receptor antagonists such as MPEP and MTEP bind to the same allosteric site and are efficacious in preclinical models of anxiety and depression. Consequently, the allosteric-binding site of the mGlu5 receptor is an attractive target for the discovery of novel psychiatric therapies.

Concentration of receptor and ligand revisited in a modified receptor binding protocol for high-affinity radioligands: [<SUP>3</SUP>H]Spiperone binding to D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> dopamine receptors	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Competition inhibition curve; Dopamine receptor; High-affinity binding assay; Spiperone; Receptor concentration	PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; D3; CELLS; NEUROBIOLOGY; ACTIVATION; CONSTANT; TARGET; SITE; D2	In receptor binding assays with ultra-high-affinity radioligands, it is difficult, in practice, to adhere the golden rule that the receptor concentration in the assay should be substantially (at least 10-fold) lower than the dissociation constant (K-d) of the radioligand and inhibition constant (K-i) of compound. Especially for low specific activity radioligands (usually tritiated ligands of a couple of TBq/mmol), routinely applied in concentrations at around or below the K-d, the use of extremely small amounts of receptor protein per assay will result in low levels of bound radioactivity; the alternative use of larger assay volumes will make it difficult to apply 96-well filtration devices. For assessing the inhibition constant (K-i) of competitive inhibitors under conditions violating the above golden rule, equations are available incorporating both [receptor] and [ligand] versus K-d; however, their application requires precise knowledge of [receptor] or initial bound/free [radioligand] ratio. In this study, we present the theoretical basis for determining the K-i for a competitive inhibitor in a new protocol at high [protein] and high [radioligand] with the simple Cheng-Prusoff correction without the need to correct for [receptor] or initial bound/free [radioligand] ratio. In addition, we present results on the binding of the ultra-high-affinity ligand [H-3]spiperone to dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors validating the K-i values calculated with the new protocol for competitive inhibitors as compared with those calculated with the most comprehensive equation available to date, that of Munson and Rodbard (1988). Binding was measured at varying [radioligand] and [receptor], test compounds (including (-)5-OH-DPAT, (+/-)7-OH-DPAT, and ropinirole) were run with varying [receptor], and simulations were done at vastly varying [radioligand] for inhibitors with vastly different K(i)s. The modified high [radioligand] protocol presented here removes a major hindrance in the proper execution of binding assays with ultra-high-affinity tritiated ligands with K-d values in the sub-nanomolar range, allowing the use of 96-well plates with small volumes of 100-200 mu l per binding assay.

Radioligand [F-18]8 could be prepared in good and reproducible radiochemical yields of 35 +/- 5% (n = 6) using late-stage radiofluorination chemistry. ATX binding analysis showed that 9-benzyl tetrahydro-b-carboline 8 has about five times better inhibitory potency than clinical candidate GLPG1690 and somewhat less inhibitory potency than ATX inhibitor PRIMATX. The binding mode for compound 8 inside the catalytic pocket of ATX using computational modelling and docking protocols revealed that compound 8 resembled a comparable binding mode to that of ATX inhibitor GLPG1690. However, PET imaging studies with radioligand [F-18]8 showed only relatively low tumour uptake and retention (SUV60min 0.21 +/- 0.03) in the tested 8305C human thyroid tumour model reaching a tumour-to-muscle ratio of similar to 2.2 after 60 min.

Methods: Anti-CYP2D6 antibodies were measured by sensitive radioligand assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and anti-arginase antibodies were measured by ELISA in 132 patients (definite AIH 11, probable AIH 36, hepatitis C 20, hepatitis B 23, other autoimmune diseases 42) and 50 healthy controls. Results: CYP2D6 index (radioligand assay) was significantly higher in all groups of patients than those in healthy controls. A higher index than the cut-off value (mean + 3 S.D. in healthy controls) was found in 36.4%, 44.4%, 25.0%, 17.4% and 28.6% of patients with definite AM, probable AM, hepatitis C, hepatitis B and other autoimmune diseases, respectively. CYP2D6 index was not related to serum IgG, anti-nuclear antibody or AIH scores, and was weakly correlated with anti-arginase antibody activity. When CYP2D6 index and anti-arginase antibodies were combined, 55.3% of AM patients were positive for either one or both antibodies. Conclusions: Anti-CYP2D6 antibodies by radioligand assay were frequently present in patients with AIH. Combined tests for anti-CYP2D6 radioligand assay and anti-arginase antibodies resulted in detection of 55% of AM patients. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

[C-11]NAD-299 was examined in the cynomolgus monkey brain with positron emission tomography (PET). After radioligand injection high accumulation of radioactivity was observed in the frontal and temporal cortex and the raphe nuclei, regions known to contain a high density of 5-HT1A receptors. Peak equilibrium appeared already at about 10 ruin after i.v. injection. Pre-treatment with a high dose of the antagonist WAY-100635 reduced the amount of radioactivity in the cortex and the raphe to the level of the cerebellum. A strong pre-treatment effect could also be achieved using pindolol, a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A-receptors. The appearance of labeled metabolites in monkey plasma was measured with HPLC. At 45 minutes after injection 49% (range 27-55%, n = 5) of radioactivity in monkey plasma represented unchanged radioligand. [C-11]NAD-299 was metabolized to more polar labeled metabolites of which one has the same chromatographic mobility as the descyclobutyl analogue of NAD-299 (NAD-272). The results indicate that [C-11]NAD-299 has potential as a PET radioligand for studies of 5-HT1A receptors in the primate brain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we report the synthesis and receptor binding characterization of [H-3]A-317920 (furan-2-carboxylic acid(2-{4-[3-([3,5-H-3]4-cyclopropanecarbonyl-phenoxy)-propyl]-piperazin-1-yl-}-methyl-2-oxo-ethyl)-amide), a high affinity inverse agonist radioligand for the rat H3 receptor. The binding of [3 H]A-317920 to rat cortical and cloned H3 receptors revealed fast on- and slower off-rate kinetics with calculated K-d values in agreement with those determined in saturation binding assays (0.2 nM for both receptors). Further, we compared [H-3]A-317920 with the agonist [H-3](N)-alpha-methylhistamine ([H-3]N alpha MH) as radioligand tools to study receptor pharmacology. Agonists and antagonists displaced [H-3]N alpha MH with one-site binding characteristics and Hill slopes approached unity. In contrast, although antagonists exhibited one-site binding. [3 H]A-317920 displacement by agonists was best fit by two-site binding models, and the potencies of the high affinity, GDP-sensitive sites correlated with the potencies defined in [H-3]N alpha MH binding. Unlike [I-125]iodoproxyfan, [H-3]A-317920 exhibits potent and selective binding to rat H-3 receptors with low binding to non-H-3 sites, including cytochrome P450. These findings show that [H-3]A-317920 is a potent rat H-3 receptor antagonist radioligand and has utility for studying H3 receptor pharmacology. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Among these compounds, only isocurcumenol, one of the newly identified constituents of this plant, was found to inhibit [H-3]Ro15-1788 binding and enhance [H-3]flunitrazepam binding in the presence of GABA. These results suggest that isocurcumenol may serve as a benzodiazepine receptor agonist and allosterically modulate GABAergic neurotransmission via enhancement of endogenous receptor ligand binding.

The human serum albumin-TEMP-2 with folic acid conjugate (termed HT2-folate) was synthesized to promote uptake through folate receptors (FRs), and a corresponding radiolabeled compound was prepared for tumor diagnosis by positron emission tomography (PET). Ga-68-NOTA-HT2-folate was synthesized from Ga-68 and the NOTA chelator with HT2-folate. The fusion protein was identified using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The radioligand was prepared with a high radiochemical yield. Cell-surface association of Ga-68-NOTA-HT2-folate significantly increased over time in FR-positive tumor cells. In animal PET and biodistribution studies, tumor uptake was very high as early as 1 h after radioligand injection. Folate conjugation enhanced the selective receptor-targeting efficacy of HT2 in FR-expressing tumors, and its radioligand will be useful as an in vitro tool and for in vivo tumor diagnosis by PET imaging.

As a result, the brain uptake of [F-18]FPCIT was significantly reduced and that of [F-18]fallypride was increased in the ipsilateral striatum (lesion side) of the 6-OHDA rats.

Predicting changes in cardiac myocyte contractility during early drug discovery with in vitro assays	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cardiac drug safety; Radioligand-binding; L-type calcium channel; Automated electrophysiology; Contractility; Myocyte	CALCIUM-CHANNEL ANTAGONISTS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY; PHARMACOLOGY; VALIDATION; PROLONGATION; NOMENCLATURE; ATTRITION; BINDING	Cardiovascular-related adverse drug effects are a major concern for the pharmaceutical industry. Activity of an investigational drug at the L-type calcium channel could manifest in a number of ways, including changes in cardiac contractility. The aim of this study was to define which of the two assay technologies - radioligand-binding or automated electrophysiology - was most predictive of contractility effects in an in vitro myocyte contractility assay. The activity of reference and proprietary compounds at the L-type calcium channel was measured by radioligand-binding assays, conventional patch-clamp, automated electrophysiology, and by measurement of contractility in canine isolated cardiac myocytes. Activity in the radioligand-binding assay at the L-type Ca channel phenylalkylamine binding site was most predictive of an inotropic effect in the canine cardiac myocyte assay. The sensitivity was 73%, specificity 83% and predictivity 78%. The radioligand-binding assay may be run at a single test concentration and potency estimated. The least predictive assay was automated electrophysiology which showed a significant bias when compared with other assay formats. Given the importance of the L-type calcium channel, not just in cardiac function, but also in other organ systems, a screening strategy emerges whereby single concentration ligand-binding can be performed early in the discovery process with sufficient predictivity, throughput and turnaround time to influence chemical design and address a significant safety-related liability, at relatively low cost.

AZD9272 is a new chemical entity pharmacologically characterised as a noncompetitive antagonist at the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5). Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to measure the time course of (C-11-AZD9272) in the brain. The study included PET measurements in six healthy volunteers where the radioligand was given as a tracer dose alone as well as post oral treatment with different doses of unlabelled AZD9272. Estimation of radioligand kinetics, including saturation of receptor binding was performed by use of non-linear mixed effects modelling. Data from the regions with the highest (ventral striatum) and lowest (cerebellum) radioligand concentrations were included in the analysis. It was assumed that the extent of non-displaceable brain uptake was the same in both regions while the rate of CNS uptake and the receptor density differed. The results of the analysis showed that AZD9272 binding at the receptor is saturable with an estimated plasma concentration corresponding to 50% occupancy of approximately 200 nM. The density of the receptor binding sites was estimated to 800 nM and 200 nM in ventral striatum and cerebellum respectively. By simultaneously analysing data from several PET measurements and different brain regions in a non-linear mixed effects framework it was possible to estimate parameters of interest that would otherwise be difficult to quantify.

Patients and Methods The primary outcome was the therapeutic responses after the first cycle of Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy. The parameters studied were the pooled proportions of any prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline and a greater than 50% PSA decline. The secondary outcome was the survival effects after Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy. Studied parameters were pooled hazard ratios of the overall survival according to any PSA decline and a greater than 50% PSA decline after the first cycle of Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy. Results In total, 10 eligible studies with 455 patients were finally included in this meta-analysis. The pooled proportions of any PSA decline was 68.00% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.55%-72.22%], and those with a greater than 50% PSA decline was 34.45% (95% CI, 30.14%-38.97%). The pooled hazard ratios for the overall survival of any PSA decline was 0.29 (95% CI, 0.21-0.40) with significance (P < 0.00001); however, a greater than 50% PSA decline was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.54-1.25) with no significance (P = 0.39). Conclusions We suggest that approximately two-thirds of any PSA decline and one-third of a greater than 50% PSA decline can be expected after the first cycle of Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy in patients with mCRPC. Moreover, any PSA decline showed survival prolongation after the first cycle of the Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.

In particular. radioligand neuroreceptor imaging can be accomplished by positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computerized tomograph (SPECT), nuclear medical Procedures involving the administration of radioisotopes to the subject. While currently primarily a research tool. several practical clinical application,, of radioligand neuroreceptor imaging are available today. Radioligand neuroreceptor imaging permit,, the determination of optimal dosages of traditional and novel psychoactive agents to produce maximal beneficial effects but minimal adverse effects, Furthermore, radioligand neuroreceptor imaging allows the identification of dysfunction in the release and transport of neurochemicals. such as second messenger systems, in the brains of individuals afflicted with different biological subtypes of nervous and mental diseases to facilitate the application of effective interventions to correct the underlying abnormalities. Gene therapy is another application of imaging techniques that provides the means to correct abnormalities in victims of malignancies, such as brain cancers. and other disease,,. Thus, the diagnosis and treatment of nervous and mental disorders is enhanced by the utilization of in vivo imaging of neurotransmitter systems.

The comparison studies between [F-18]fluoromethyl-PBR28 ([F-18]1) and its deuterate analog ([F-18]1-d(2)) were investigated in terms of in vitro binding affinity, lipophilicity and in vivo stability. In addition, the accuracies of both radioligands were determined by comparing the PET imaging data in the same LPS-induced neuroinflammation rat model. Both aryloxyanilide analogs showed similar lipophilicity and in vitro affinity for TSPO. However, [F-18]1-d(2) provided significantly lower femur uptake than [F-18]1 (1.5 +/- 1.2 vs. 4.1 +/- 1.7%ID/g at 2 h post-injection) in an ex vivo biodistribution study. [F-18]1-d(2) was also selectively accumulated in the inflammatory lesion with the binding potential of the specifically bound radioligand relative to the non-displaceable radioligand in tissue (BPND = 3.17 +/- 0.48), in a LPS-induced acute neuroinflammation rat model, comparable to that of [F-18]1 (BPND = 2.13 +/- 0.51). These results indicate that [F-18]1-d(2) had higher in vivo stability, which resulted in an enhanced target-to-background ratio compared to that induced by [F-18]1.

Cucurbituril-Ferrocene: Host-Guest Based Pretargeted Positron Emission Tomography in a Xenograft Model	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MEDULLARY-THYROID CARCINOMA; IMMUNOREACTIVE FRACTION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; IMMUNO-PET; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; CHEMISTRY; CANCER; CEA	Pretargeted positron emission tomography is a macromolecule-driven nuclear medicine technique that involves targeting a preadministered antigen target-bound macromolecule with a radioligand in vivo, aiming to minimize the overall radiation dose. This study investigates the use of antibody based host-guest chemistry methodology for pretargeted positron emission tomography. We hypothesize that the novel pretargeting approach reported here overcomes the challenges the current pretargeting platforms have with the in vivo stability and modularity of the pretargeting components. A cucurbit[7]uril host molecule modified, anti-carcinoembryonic antigen antibody (MSA; CB7-MSA) and a Ga-68-radiolabeled ferrocene guest radioligand ([Ga-68]Ga-NOTA-PEG(3)-NMe2-Fc) were studied as potential host-guest chemistry pretargeting agents for positron emission tomography in BxPC3 xenografted nude mice. The viability of the platform was studied via in vivo biodistribution and positron emission tomography. Tumor uptake of [Ga-68]Ga-NOTA-PEG(3)-NMe2-Fc was significantly higher in mice which received CB7-MSA prior to the radioligand injection (pretargeted) (3.3 +/- 0.7%ID/g) compared to mice which only received the radioligand (nonpretargeted) (0.2 +/- 0.1%ID/g).

Here, we describe filter-based radioligand binding assays at equilibrium, either varying ligand concentrations up to receptor saturation or outcompeting ligand from its receptor with increasing concentrations of ligand analogue. Using the auxin coreceptor system, we illustrate how to use a saturation binding assay to determine the apparent dissociation constant (K-D') for the formation of a ternary TIR1-auxin-AUX/IAA complex. Also, we show how to determine the inhibitory constant (K-i) for auxin binding by the coreceptor complex via a competition binding assay. These assays can be applied broadly to characterize a one-site binding reaction of a hormone to its receptor.	[Hellmuth, Antje; Villalobos, Luz Irina A.

[3H]Chiba-1001(methyl-SSR180711) has low in vitro binding affinity and poor in vivo selectivity to nicotinic alpha-7 receptor in rodent brain	SYNAPSE			English	Article						in vitro binding assay; in vivo receptor occupancy; brain regional uptake; inhibition	ALPHA-7-NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; SUBUNIT GENE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PARTIAL AGONIST; RAT-BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SUBTYPES; RADIOLIGAND; BUNGAROTOXIN; LOCALIZATION	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists active at the alpha-7 (alpha-7) receptor subtype are potential therapeutics for cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and other mental disorders. SSR180711, an alpha-7 selective partial agonist, has been shown to improve preclinical cognition. A novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, 11C-Chiba1001, is a close analog of SSR180711. We labeled Chiba-1001 with tritium in order to evaluate its utility as a preclinical radioligand tool. In vitro, the binding affinity of [3H]Chiba-1001 at the alpha-7 receptor was low (Kd = 120-180 nM) in both HEK239 cell membranes expressing human alpha-7 receptor and in native rat hippocampus membranes. The alpha-7 selective ligands AZD0328, ARR17779, and MLA did not inhibit [3H]Chiba-1001 binding (Ki > 10,000 nM). In rat hippocampal membranes, Chiba-1001 and SSR180711 inhibited [3H]Chiba-1001 binding (Ki = 220 and 230 nM, respectively), consistent with the literature reports. The in vivo binding profile of the radioligand was examined in normal rat, wild type mouse, and alpha-7 knockout mouse brain. We found that [3H]Chiba-1001 lacks adequate and specific brain regional uptake in rat and mouse brain. No significant inhibition of the radioligand binding was obtained following pretreatment of the animal with AZ11637326, AZD0328, or MLA. Our results indicate that [3H]Chiba-1001 has low affinity for alpha-7 nAChRs in vitro and poor alpha-7 regional and pharmacological selectivity in the rodent brain. Synapse, 2012.

[F-18]FBFP was synthesized in one step from an iodonium ylide precursor. In cynomolgus monkeys, [F-18]FBFP displayed high brain uptake and suitable tissue kinetics for quantitative analysis. It exhibited heterogeneous distribution with higher regional volume of distribution (V-T) values in the amygdala, hippocampus, insula, and frontal cortex. Pretreatment with the sigma(1) receptor agonist SA4503 (0.5 mg/kg) significantly reduced radioligand uptake in the monkey brain (>95%), indicating high binding specificity of [F-18]FBFP in vivo. Compared with (S)-[F-18]fluspidine, [F-18]FBFP possessed higher regional nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) values across the brain regions. These findings demonstrate that [F-18]FBFP is a highly promising PET radioligand for imaging and quantification of sigma(1) receptors in humans.

MS binding assays for GlyT1 based on Org24598 as nonlabelled reporter ligand	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Binding assay; Neurotransmitter; Glycine transporter 1; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry	GLYCINE TRANSPORTER INHIBITORS; D-ASPARTATE RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; SELECTIVE INHIBITOR; ANIMAL-MODELS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; DOPAMINE; QUANTITATION; DISCOVERY; MARKERS	In this study an alternative to radioligand binding assays addressing the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) based on quantification of a nonlabelled reporter ligand by means of mass spectrometry (MS) is presented. The established MS Binding Assays employ the GlyT1 inhibitor Org24598 as reporter ligand for which a highly sensitive LC-ESI-MS/MS (liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry) method was developed. A validation of this LC-ESI-MS/MS method with respect to selectivity, linearity, accuracy and precision according to the FDA guidance demonstrated its reliability for quantification of Org24598 in binding experiments. For the implementation of GlyT1 binding experiments conditions in accordance to known GlyT1 radioligand binding assays and already known filtration based MS Binding Assays were chosen. In saturation experiments the affinity of Org24598 towards GIyT1 could be characterized with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) of 16.8 +/- 2.2 nM that is well in agreement with the affinity determined in radioligand binding assays. Finally, several known GlyT ligands were studied in competition experiments and the determined inhibition constants (K-i) compared with results from radioligand binding and uptake assays. The almost perfect correlation of the affinities obtained in the MS based binding experiments with results from literature clearly indicates that the established GlyT1 MS Binding Assays are a powerful substitute for the GlyT1 radioligand binding assays so far used for affinity profiling and screening.

Jeffrey			Differential Pharmacology and Binding of mGlu<sub>2</sub> Receptor Allosteric Modulators	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; CNS DISORDERS; SUBTYPE 5; IN-VIVO; POTENT; RADIOLIGAND; SITE; DEPRESSION; DISCOVERY; AFFINITY	Allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu(2)) has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical rodent models of several brain disorders, leading to industry and academic drug discovery efforts. Although the pharmacology and binding sites of some mGlu(2) allosteric modulators have been characterized previously, questions remain about the nature of the allosteric mechanism of cooperativity with glutamate and whether structurally diverse allosteric modulators bind in an identical manner to specific allosteric sites. To further investigate the in vitro pharmacology of mGlu(2) allosteric modulators, we developed and characterized a novel mGlu(2) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) radioligand in parallel with functional studies of a structurally diverse set of mGlu(2) PAMs and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs). Using an operational model of allosterism analyze the functional data, we found that PAMs affect both the affinity and efficacy of glutamate at mGlu(2), whereas NAMs predominantly affect the efficacy of glutamate in our assay system. More importantly, we found that binding of a novel mGlu(2) PAM radioligand was inhibited by multiple structurally diverse PAMs and NAMs, indicating that they may bind to the mGlu(2) allosteric site labeled with the novel mGlu(2) PAM radioligand; however, further studies suggested that these allosteric modulators do not all interact with the radioligand in an identical manner. Together, these findings provide new insights into the binding sites and modes of efficacy of different structurally and functionally distinct mGlu(2) allosteric modulators and suggest that different ligands either interact with distinct sites or adapt different binding poses to shared allosteric site(s).

Unexpectedly, the Blanc reaction permitted successful synthesis of 2,5-dimethoxyphenylpropylamine derivatives having a substituted methyl group in position 4 since solvation of the reactant occurs during the reaction. Afterwards, their affinities towards the 5-HT2A receptor were examined in 5-HT2A radioligand receptor binding assays. The study of these substances is of considerable interest because they were predicted, by preliminary molecular modeling studies based on mescalin units, to be potential new hallucinogens that should be added to the list of substances prohibited by law. It was assumed that DOMCl would be 82 times more potent as a hallucinogen than mescalin, and DOMOM would be 94 times more potent. The 5-HT2A radioligand receptor binding studies showed that the affinities of DOMCl and DOMOM for the 5-HT2A receptor are less than expected but are nevertheless 1.6 and 8.7 times higher, respectively, than that of mescalin. Therefore, scheduling these substances as potential drugs of abuse might be considered.

Previous studies showed that AMT-induced cardiovascular toxic effects were prevented/reversed by selective adenosine receptor (AR) antagonists. This study aimed to examine whether AMT mediates its cardiovascular effect through binding to ARs and for this purpose measured the binding affinity of AMT to A(1)-or A(2a)-ARs. Materials and Methods: Membranes expressing the A(1)- or A(2a)-ARs were labeled with their specific radioactive ligands ([H-3]-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine and [H-3]CGS21680, respectively). The displacement of the radioligand binding was determined in the presence of different concentrations of AMT or the selective adenosine receptor antagonists for A(1)-AR and A(2a)-AR, 8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) and [8-(3-Chlorostyryl) caffeine (CSC), respectively. The students t-test was used to compare the differences of two groups. Results: The bound A(2a)-AR radioligand was completely displaced by AMT and the Ki value was calculated [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 51.42 +/- 15.87 mu M and Ki: 4.8 +/- 0.11 mu M, p<0.05]. High concentrations of AMT (10(4) and 10(3) M) inhibited radioligand binding to the A(1)-AR, which was nearly 25% (p<0.05). Conclusion: AMT showed significant binding to the A(2a)-AR, which might play an important role in its pharmacological and toxicological effects. Finally, the toxicity of high AMT concentrations may be mediated through the A(1)-AR.

Interaction of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole derivatives with sigma-1 receptors	PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY JOURNAL			English	Article						afobazole; afobazole metabolite; sigma(1) receptor; radioligand binding		The interaction of afobazole and its main metabolite M-11 {2-[2-(3-oxomorpholin-4-yl)ethylthio]-5-ethoxybenzimidazole hydrochloride} with sigma-1 (sigma(1)) receptors was studied in vitro in radioligand binding experiments on human T-cell lymphoblast-like cell line. Afobazole exhibited ligand properties towards sigma(1) receptors with IC50 = 7.1 x 10(-6) M. For M-11, the corresponding value was IC50 = 9.6x10(-4) M. Experiments in vitro on CD-1 mouse brain homogenate established that afobazole interacted with sigma(1) receptors (IC50 = 1.37x10(-5) M) whereas M-11 did not show affinity towards sigma(1) receptors (IC50 > 5x10(-4) M). Radioligand analysis results on mongrel CD-1 mice confirmed the results obtained on human T-cell lymphoblast-like cell line and led to the conclusion that sigma(1) receptors did not contribute to the pharmacological effects of M-11.

Every single one of the synthesized compounds was evaluated through radioligand binding experiments. The compounds with the best affinities in the in vitro studies were selected to be investigated for their anti-nociceptive activity by way of tail flick test. Compounds 3h and 3i (Ki = 0.55 nM; IC50 = 1.25 nM and, Ki = 0.83 nM; IC50 = 1.87 nM, respectively) displayed the best affinities compared to that of sufentanil's (K-i = 0.70 nM; IC50 = 1.59 nM). 3h put on display the highest potency (ED50 = 4.21 mu g/kg) for tail flick test amongst the entire selected compounds.

First-in-Human Evaluation of 18F-PF-06445974, a PET Radioligand That Preferentially Labels Phosphodiesterase-4B	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B); PET; 18F-PF-06445974	BRAIN; BINDING; TARGET	Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4), which metabolizes the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), has 4 isozymes: PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D. PDE4B and PDE4D have the highest expression in the brain and may play a role in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression and dementia. This study evaluated the proper-ties of the newly developed PDE4B-selective radioligand 18F-PF-06445974 in the brains of rodents, monkeys, and humans. Methods: Three monkeys and 5 healthy human volunteers underwent PET scans after intravenous injection of 18F-PF-06445974. Brain uptake was quantified as total distribution volume (VT) using the standard 2-tissue -compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. Results: 18F-PF-06445974 readily distributed through-out monkey and human brain and had the highest binding in the thala-mus. The value of VT was well identified by a 2-tissue-compartment model but increased by 10% during the terminal portions (40 and 60 min) of the monkey and human scans, respectively, consistent with radiometabolite accumulation in the brain. The average human VT values for the whole brain were 9.5 6 2.4 mL center dot cm23. Radiochromato-graphic analyses in knockout mice showed that 2 efflux transporters- permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-completely cleared the problematic radiometabolite but also partially cleared the parent radioligand from the brain. In vitro studies with the human transporters suggest that the parent radioligand was a partial substrate for BCRP and, to a lesser extent, for P-gp. Conclusion: 18F-PF-06445974 quantified PDE4B in the human brain with reason-able, but not complete, success. The gold standard compartmental method of analyzing brain and plasma data successfully identified the regional densities of PDE4B, which were widespread and highest in the thalamus, as expected. Because the radiometabolite-induced error was only about 10%, the radioligand is, in the opinion of the authors, suitable to extend to clinical studies.

Altered histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor radioligand binding in post-mortem brain samples from subjects with psychiatric diseases	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						histamine H-3 receptor; schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; major depression; prefrontal cortex; temporal cortex; hippocampal formation; cognition	FAMOTIDINE ADJUNCTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPY; CHOLINERGIC SYSTEMS; MEMORY RETENTION; BIPOLAR DISORDER; SPLICE VARIANTS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; GRAY-MATTER; SCHIZOPHRENIA; TURNOVER; NUCLEUS	Histamine is a modulatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Auto- and hetero-histamine H-3 receptors are present in human brain and are potential targets of antipsychotics. These receptors may also display disease-related abnormalities in psychiatric disorders. Here we have assessed how histamine H-3 receptors in human brain may be affected in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression. Histamine H-3 receptor radioligand binding assays were applied to frozen post-mortem prefrontal and temporal cortical sections and anterior hippocampal sections from subjects with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and matched controls. Compared with the controls, increased H-3 receptor radioligand binding was found in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects (especially the ones who were treated with atypical antipsychotics), and bipolar subjects with psychotic symptoms. No differences in H-3 receptor radioligand binding were found in the temporal cortex. In hippocampal formation of control subjects, H-3 receptor radioligand binding was prominent in dentate gyrus, subiculum, entorhinal cortex and parasubiculum. Decreased H-3 binding was found in the CA4 area of bipolar subjects. Decreased H-3 binding in CA2 and presubiculum of medication-free bipolar subjects was also seen. The results suggest that histamine H-3 receptors in the prefrontal cortex take part in the modulation of cognition, which is impaired in schizophrenic subjects and bipolar subjects with psychotic symptoms. Histamine H-3 receptors probably regulate connections between hippocampus and various cortical and subcortical regions and could also be involved in the neuropathology of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.

Methods: Rechallenge radioligand therapy was defined as subsequent treatment with Lu-177-PSMA after initial exposure with an excellent response followed by progression. Biochemical, radiographic, clinical antitumor response, and adverse events were analyzed. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were calculated. Results: Eight patients underwent a median of 2 (range: 1-4) cycles of rechallenge with Lu-177-PSMA for imaging and therapy. A maximum PSA decrease of 50% was achieved in 3 patients (37.5%). Radiographic response was favorable in 3 patients, whereas 4 exhibited progressive disease. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status was stable during therapy in all patients. No grade 4 toxicity was noticed, and grade 3 toxicity occurred in 3 patients (37.5%). The median PSA-PFS and overall survival were 3.2 mo (95% confidence interval, 2.6-3.7 mo) and 14.0 mo (95% confidence interval, 6.2-21.8 mo), respectively. Conclusion: In a small patient cohort with an initial excellent response, Lu-177-PSMA rechallenge is still active, with lower efficacy and higher toxicity.

The compound Ib was characterized for its binding both in monkey and rat striatum tissue, which demonstrated its high selectivity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) when its binding was compared with that at the serotonin transporter (SERT). The compound 5, which is a precursor for the tritiated radiolabel ligand [H-3]O-972, was synthesized and biologically characterized. The preliminary characterization of this novel radioligand revealed its strong binding affinity for the DAT. Thus, the pharmacological profile of [H-3]O-972 indicated that DAT inhibitors, which include GBR 12909, mazindol, CFT, and cocaine, could potently displace this novel radioligand from monkey brain striatum tissue. On the other hand, compounds known to be not selective for and potent at the DAT were very weak to do so. Initial binding results also indicate that [H-3]O-972 may interact with the DAT in a manner that is not identical to that for GBR 12909 and tropane analogs. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This study aimed to develop a radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of hepsin. Six leucine-arginine (Leu-Arg) dipeptide derivatives (two diastereomers for each of three ligands) were synthesized and evaluated for their binding affinities and selectivity for hepsin. Based on the binding assay, a Cu-nat-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N',N '' N'''-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)-conjugated ligand (3B) was selected for the development of a PET radioligand. [Cu-64]3B was synthesized by labeling the DOTA-conjugated compound 11B with [Cu-64]CuCl2 at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The radioligand was evaluated for prostate cancer cell binding and PET imaging in a prostate tumor mouse model. The results demonstrated that [Cu-64]3B exhibited high binding to LNCaP cells, intermediate binding to 22Rv1 cells, and low binding to PC3 cells. PET studies of [Cu-64]3B in mice, implanted with 22Rv1 and PC3 cells on each flank, revealed that the radioligand uptake was high and persistent in the 22Rv1 tumors over time, whereas it was low in PC3 tumors. The results of this study suggest that [Cu-64]3B is a promising PET radioligand for hepsin imaging.

The aim was to study the efficacy of the pTnT-rhtTG plasmid and subsequent diagnostic accuracy of tTG autoantibodies for childhood celiac disease using radioligand binding assays. Methods: Coupled in vitro transcription and translation of tTG were performed by pTnT-rhtTG as well as by the pGEMt Easy-rhtTG vectors using the TNT SP6 Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System in the presence of [(35)S] methionine. Sera from 190 celiac disease children and 74 controls were measured for tTG autoantibodies in two separate radioligand binding assays using anti-human IgA agarose and protein A sepharose beads for the detection of IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG, respectively. Results: Median incorporation of [(35)S] methionine into the pTnT-rhtTG was 26% compared to 16% for the pGEMt Easy-rhtTG plasmid (p = 0.0016). Using pTnT-rhtTG (as compared to pGEMt Easy-rhtTG), sensitivities were IgA-tTG = 96.3% (95.7%) and IgG-tTG = 95.8% (97.3%) and specificities were IgA-tTG = 91.9% (90.5%) and IgG-tTG = 94.6% (98.4%). According to receiver operator characteristics for the pTnT (pGEMt Easy) assays, area under the curves were IgA-tTG = 98.4% (98.4%) and IgG-tTG = 97.7% (97.2%), respectively. Conclusion: The pTnT-rhtTG plasmid increased the efficacy of tTG antigen usage without reducing the diagnostic accuracy of IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG for childhood celiac disease. The pTnT-rhtTG plasmid is therefore recommended over the pGEMt Easy-rhtTG for the assessment of IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG using radioligand binding assays.

The brain uptake of [18F]fluorodeprenyl was more than 7% (600% SUV) of the total injected radioactivity and similar to that of [11C]deprenyl, an established MAO-B radioligand. The highest uptake was observed in the striatum, one of the MAO-B-rich regions, with a peak at approximately 23 min after injection, followed by lower uptake in the thalamus and the cortex and lowest uptake in the cerebellum. Brain uptake of [18F]fluorodeprenyl was largely inhibited by preadministration of the MAO-B inhibitor, L-deprenyl, whereas clorgyline, a MAO Type A blocker, had no significant inhibitory effect, thus demonstrating selectivity for MAO-B. [18F]Fluorodeprenyl showed relatively slow metabolism with the presence of two radiometabolite peaks with similar retention time as the labeled metabolites of [11C]deprenyl. These results suggest that [18F]fluorodeprenyl is a potential PET radioligand for visualization of MAO-B activity. Synapse, 2012. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In binding studies, this compound exhibits sub-nanomolar affinity and a high degree of selectivity (900-1800-fold) for human oxytocin receptors compared to human vasopressin receptors. This compound appears suitable for studying the pharmacology of oxytocin receptors in human and nonhuman primate tissues, for which there is currently a paucity of highly selective tools. It may also be useful as a nonlabeled competitor or as a radioligand in autoradiographic studies of oxytocin receptor localization in these tissues. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

The K-d and T-1/2 of dissociation of NIDA522131 binding measured at 37 degrees C in vitro were 4.9 +/- 0.4 pmol/L and 81 +/- 5 min, respectively. The patterns of radioactivity distribution in monkey brain in vivo was similar to that of 2-[F-18]fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2FA), a radioligand that has been successfully used in humans, and matched the alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChRs distribution. Comparison between [F-18]NIDA522131 and 2FA demonstrated better in vivo binding properties of the new radioligand and substantially greater radioactivity accumulation in brain. Consistent with [F-18]NIDA522131 elevated affinity for nAChRs and its increased lipophilicity, both, the total and non-displaceable distribution volumes were substantially higher than those of 2FA. Estimated binding potential values in different brain regions, characterizing the specificity of receptor binding, were 3-4 fold higher for [F-18]NIDA522131 than those of 2FA. Pharmacological evaluation in mice demonstrated a toxicity that was comparable to 2FA and is in agreement with a 2300 fold higher affinity at alpha(4)beta(2)* versus alpha(3)beta(4)* nAChRs. These results suggest that [F-18]NIDA522131 is a promising positron emission tomography radioligand for studying extrathalamic nAChR in humans.

Simultaneous Multiple MS Binding Assays Addressing D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> Dopamine Receptors	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article						binding assays; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; neurotransmitters; receptors	MASS-SPECTROMETRY; IN-VIVO; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; ADENOSINE A(1); QUANTITATION; DRUG; PHARMACOLOGY; TRANSPORTER; INHIBITOR; PLASMA	MS Binding Assays are a label-free alternative to radioligand binding assays. They provide basically the same capabilities as the latter, but use a non-labeled reporter ligand instead of a radioligand. In contrast to radioligand binding assays, MS Binding Assays offerowing to the selectivity of mass spectrometric detectionthe opportunity to monitor the binding of different reporter ligands at different targets simultaneously. The present study shows a proof of concept for this strategy as exemplified for MS Binding Assays selectively addressing D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors in a single binding experiment. A highly sensitive, rapid and robust LC-ESI-MS/MS quantification method capable of quantifying both SCH23390 and raclopride, selectively addressing D-1 and D-2 receptors, respectively, was established and validated for this purpose. Based thereon, simultaneous saturation and competition experiments with SCH23390 and raclopride in the presence of both D-1 and D-2 receptors were performed and analyzed by LC-MS/MS within a single chromatographic cycle. The present study thus demonstrates the feasibility of this strategy and the high versatility of MS Binding Assays that appears to surpass that common for conventional radioligand binding assays.

The 5-HT1B receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that exists in two different agonist affinity states. An agonist ligand is expected to be more sensitive towards competition from another agonist, such as endogenous 5-HT, than an antagonist ligand. It is of interest to know whether the intrinsic activity of a PET radioligand for the 5-HT1B receptor impacts on its ability to detect changes in endogenous synaptic 5-HT density. Three high-affinity C-11-labeled 5-HT1B PET radioligands with differing intrinsic activity were applied to PET measurements in cynomolgus monkey to evaluate their sensitivity to be displaced within the brain by endogenous 5-HT. For these experiments, fenfluramine was pre-administered at two different doses (1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg, i.v.) to induce synaptic 5-HT release. Results A dose-dependent response to fenfluramine was detected for all three radioligands. At the highest dose of fenfluramine (5.0 mg/kg, i.v.), reductions in specific binding in the occipital cortex increased with radioligand agonist efficacy, reaching 61% for [C-11]3. The most antagonistic radioligand showed the lowest reduction in specific binding. Conclusions Three 5-HT1B PET radioligands were identified with differing intrinsic activity that could be used in imaging high- and low-affinity states of 5-HT1B receptors using PET. From this limited study, radioligand sensitivity to endogenous 5-HT appears to depend on agonist efficacy. More extensive studies are required to substantiate this suggestion.

Positron emission tomography (PET) with an effective D3R radioligand could be a useful tool for the development of such therapeutics by elucidating pharmacological specificity and target engagement in vivo. Currently, a D3R-selective radioligand does not exist. The D3R ligand, N-(4-(4-(3-chloro-2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1H-indole-2-carboxamide (BAK4-51, 1), has attractive properties for PET radioligand development, including full antagonist activity, very high D3R affinity, D3R selectivity, and moderate lipophilicity. We labeled 1 with the positron-emitter carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) in the methoxy group for evaluation as a radioligand in animals with PET. However, [C-11]1 was found to be an avid substrate for brain efflux transporters and lacked D3R-specific signal in rodent and monkey brain in vivo.

The regional brain distribution of each radioligand following intravenous injection into cynomolgus monkey was examined in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). For all three radioligands, the regional brain distribution of radioactivity was slightly heterogeneous, with higher uptake of radioactivity in the mesencephalon, thalamus and lower brainstem than in striatum. The rank order of maximal brain radioactivity (as percentage of injected dose) was [C-11]DMI (2.7%) > [C-11]talsupram (1.3%) > [C-11]talopram (0.7%). The appearance of radioactive metabolites in plasma was similar for each radioligand (75-85% of radioactivity in plasma at 45 min). These metabolites were all more polar than their parent radioligand. The data show that these radioligands are inferior to existing radioligands for the study of brain NET with PET in vivo.

In the current report, we have used plasma samples of healthy volunteers to investigate the radiometabolites of (S)-[F-18]1 and elucidate their structures with LC-MS/MS. For the latter purpose additional in vitro studies were conducted by incubation of (S)-[F-18]1 and (S)-1 with human liver microsomes (HLM). in vitro metabolites were characterized by interpretation of MS/MS fragmentation patterns from collision-induced dissociation or by use of reference compounds. Thereby, structures of corresponding radio-HPLC-detected radiometabolites, both in vitro and in vivo (human), could be identified. By incubation with HLM, mainly debenzylation and hydroxylation occurred, beside further mono- and di-oxygenations. The product hydroxylated at the fluoroethyl side chain was glucuronidated. Plasma samples (10, 20, 30 min p.i., n = 5-6), obtained from human subjects receiving 250-300 MBq (S)-[F-18]1 showed 97.2, 95.4, and 91.0% of unchanged radioligand, respectively. In urine samples (90 min p.i.) the fraction of unchanged radioligand was only 2.6% and three major radiometabolites were detected. The one with the highest percentage, also found in plasma, matched the glucuronide formed in vitro. Only a small amount of debenzylated metabolite was detected. In conclusion, our metabolic study, in particular the high fractions of unchanged radioligand in plasma, confirms the suitability of (S)-[F-18]1 as PET radioligand for sigma-1 receptor imaging.

The PSMA-targeting ligand p-SCN-Bn-TCMC-PSMA (NG001) labelled with Pb-212 efficiently targets PSMA-positive cells in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this preclinical study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Pb-212-NG001 in multicellular tumour spheroid and mouse models of prostate cancer. The cytotoxic effect of Pb-212-NG001 was tested in human prostate C4-2 spheroids. Biodistribution at various time points and therapeutic effects of different activities of the radioligand were investigated in male athymic nude mice bearing C4-2 tumours, while long-term toxicity was studied in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. The radioligand induced a selective cytotoxic effect in spheroids at activity concentrations of 3-10 kBq/mL. In mice, the radioligand accumulated rapidly in tumours and was retained over 24 h, while it rapidly cleared from nontargeted tissues. Treatment with 0.25, 0.30 or 0.40 MBq of Pb-212-NG001 significantly inhibited tumour growth and improved median survival with therapeutic indexes of 1.5, 2.3 and 2.7, respectively. In BALB/c mice, no signs of long-term radiation toxicity were observed at activities of 0.05 and 0.33 MBq. The obtained results warrant clinical studies to evaluate the biodistribution, therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of Pb-212-NG001.

Since most ligand binding data are currently fitted by classical equations developed only for monomeric receptors, the interpretation of data could be misleading in the presence of GPCR dimers. On the other hand, the equations developed from dimer receptor models assuming the existence of two orthosteric binding sites within the dimeric molecule offer the possibility to directly calculate macroscopic equilibrium dissociation constants for the two sites, an index of cooperativity (D-C) that reflects the molecular communication within the dimer and, importantly, a constant of radioligand-competitor allosteric interaction (K-DAB) in competitive assays. Here, we provide a practical way to fit competitive binding data that allows the interpretation of apparently anomalous results, such as competition curves that could be either bell-shaped, monophasic or biphasic depending on the assay conditions. The consideration of a radioligand-competitor allosteric interaction allows fitting these curve patterns both under simulation conditions and in real radioligand binding experiments, obtaining competitor affinity parameters closer to the actual values. Our approach is the first that, assuming the formation of receptor homodimers, is able to explain several experimental results previously considered erroneous due to their impossibility to be fitted. We also deduce the radioligand concentration responsible for the conversion of biphasic to monophasic or to bell-shaped curves in competitive radioligand binding assays. In conclusion, bell-shaped curves in competitive binding experiments constitute evidence for GPCR homodimerization.

[H-3]MSX-2 binding to rat striatal membranes was saturable and reversible. Saturation experiments showed that [H-3]MSX-2 labeled a single class of binding sites with high affinity (K-d = 8.0 nM) and limited capacity (B-max = 1.16 fmol . mg(-1) of protein). The presence of 100 mu M GTP, or 10 mM magnesium chloride, respectively, had no effect on [H-3]MSX-2 binding. AR agonists competed with the binding of 1 nM [H-3]MSX-2 with the following order of potency: 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA)> 2-[4-(carboxyethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (CGS-21680) >2-chloroadenosine (2-CADO) >N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). AR antagonists showed the following order of potency: 8-(m-bromostyryl)-3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (BS-DMPX)>1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX)> (R)-5,6-dimethyl-7-(1-phenylethyl)-2-(4-pyridyl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine-4-amine (SH-128)>3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX)>caffeine. The K-i values for antagonists were in accordance with data from binding studies with the agonist radioligand [H-3]CGS21680, while agonist affinities were 3-7-fold lower, [H-3]MSX-2 is a highly selective A(2A) AR antagonist radioligand exhibiting a selectivity of at least two orders of magnitude versus all other AR subtypes. The new radioligand shows high specific radioactivity (85 Ci/mmol, 3150 GBq/mmol) and acceptable nonspecific binding at rat striatal membranes of 20-30%, at 1 nM. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

To study ERGO biodistribution and detect oxidative stress in vivo, we report an efficient and reproducible preparation of [C-11]-labeled ERGO PET radioligand based on protecting the histidine carboxylic group with a methyl ester. Overall, this new protection approach using methyl ester improved the chemical yield of a 4-step reaction from 14% to 24% compared to the previous report using t-butyl ester. The [C-11]CH3 methylation of the precursor provided the desired product with 55 +/- 10% radiochemical purity and a molar activity of 450 +/- 200 TBq center dot mmol(-1). The [C-11]ERGO radioligand was able to detect threshold levels of oxidative stress in a preclinical animal model of Alzheimer's disease.

[<SUP>3</SUP>H]Org 43553, the first low-molecular-weight agonistic and allosteric Radioligand for the human luteinizing hormone receptor	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; GONADOTROPIN RECEPTOR; LIGAND-BINDING; WILD-TYPE; IDENTIFICATION; ANTAGONIST; DOMAIN	The luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor plays a pivotal role in reproduction. The high-molecular-weight (HMW) human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and LH are the endogenous ligands of this receptor and bind to its large N terminus. The present study characterizes the binding of a new low-molecular-weight (LMW) radioligand, [H-3]5-amino-2-methylsulfanyl-4-[3-(2-morpholin-4-ylacetylamino)phenyl]- thieno[2,3-d] pyrimidine-6-carboxylic acid tert-butylamide (Org 43553), at the LH receptor. Equilibrium saturation and displacement assays were developed and optimized. Specific binding of [H-3]Org 43553 to CHO-K1 cell membranes expressing the human LH receptor and a cAMP response element-luciferase reporter gene was saturable with a K-D value of 2.4 +/- 0.4 nM and a B-max value of 1.6 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg protein. Affinities of five LMW analogs of Org 43553 were determined. All displaced the radioligand competitively, with K-i values ranging from 3.3 to 100 nM. Finally, the potency of these compounds in a cAMP-induced luciferase assay was also determined. There was a high correlation between affinity and potency (r = 0.99; P < 0.0001) of these compounds. In the search for LMW ligands, which bind allosterically to the seven-transmembrane domain of the LH receptor, a HMW radioligand (e.g., I-125-hCG) is not suitable as it is not displaced by a LMW compound. Therefore, [H-3] Org 43553, a new radioligand with good binding properties, allows screening for new LMW ligands that mimic the action of the endogenous hormone at the LH receptor.

However, this radioligand has some drawbacks for deriving relative regional receptor densities, including rapid metabolism, which acts against accurate definition of an arterial input function for compartmental modeling, and very low nonspecific binding in brain, which detracts from the accuracy of modeling by a simplified reference tissue (cerebellum) approach. Here, in a search for a radioligand that overcomes these limitations, we investigated the effects of introducing a single methyl group at either of the carbon atoms alpha to the amide bond in [C-11]WAY-100635. Procedures: Ligands with a methyl group on the alpha carbon of the cyclohexyl group (SWAY) or the alpha carbon of the C2H4 linker ((R,S)-JWAY) were synthesized and tested for binding affinity and intrinsic activity at 5-HT1A receptors. SWAY was labeled with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 minutes; beta(+) = 99.8%) in its O-methyl group and (R,S)-JWAY in its carbonyl group. Each radioligand was evaluated by PET experiments in cynomolgus monkey. Results: SWAY and (R,S)-JWAY were found to be high-affinity antagonists at 5-HT1A receptors. After injection of [C-11]SWAY into monkey, radioactivity uptake in brain reached a maximum of 3% at 4.5 minutes and decreased to 0.7% at 72 minutes. However, over the time span of the experiment, radioactivity concentrations in 5-HT1A receptor-rich brain regions were only fractionally higher than in cerebellum. Radioactivity represented by parent radioligand in plasma was 39% at 45 minutes. After injection of [C-11](R,S)-JWAY alone, radioactivity uptake in brain reached a maximum of 4.8% at 2.5 minutes and decreased to 1.2% at 90 minutes. At this time, radioactivity concentration in 5-HT1A receptor-rich brain regions was markedly greater than in cerebellum. In another PET experiment, the monkey was predosed with WAY-100635 before [C-11](R,S)-JWAY injection. At 90 minutes after injection, the ratio of radioactivity in 5-HT1A receptor-rich regions to that in cerebellum was reduced to near unity. Radioactivity represented by parent radioligand in plasma was 12% at 45 minutes. Conclusions: [C-11](R,S)-JWAY, but not [C-11]SWAY, gives a sizeable 5-HT1A receptor-selective PET signal in monkey. The presence of a C-methyl group adjacent to the amide bond in SWAY or (R,S)-JWAY fails to counter metabolism.

Herein, we report the development of a novel fluorinated derivative, namely, [F-18](S)-3-(6-(3-fluoropropoxy)benzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)-5-(methoxymethyl)oxazolidin-2-one ([F-18]FSL25.1188; [F-18]6), as a candidate F-18-labeled MAO-B radioligand, and, its subsequent preclinical evaluation in non-human primates (NHP). [F-18]6 was produced and isolated ( > 6 GBq) with high radiochemical purity ( > 99%), and molar activity ( > 100 GBq/mu mol at time of injection). Autoradiography studies conducted in post-mortem human brain sections revealed [(18)f]6 binding in MAO-B rich regions. PET imaging study of [F-18]6 in NHP showed high brain uptake (SUV > 2.5) as well as a regional brain radioactivity distribution in accordance with MAO-B expression. [F-18]6 displayed favorable in vivo kinetics, with an early peak in the time-activity curve followed by progressive wash-out from the NHP brain. Specificity of [F-18]6 was investigated in a pre-treatment study with L-deprenyl (1.0 mg/kg) wherein reduced radioligand uptake was observed in all MAO-B rich regions. Results from the current preclinical investigation suggests [F-18]6 is a promising MAO-B PET radioligand. Further evaluation of [F-18]6 and structurally related F-18-analogs are underway to identify an optimized candidate for clinical research studies.

Characterization of pulmonary sigma receptors by radioligand binding	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Sigma receptor; Pulmonary pharmacology; Mouse; Radioligand binding	RECOGNITION SITES; H-3 (+)-PENTAZOCINE; LIGAND-BINDING; COCAINE; AFFINITY; PROTEIN; RAT; DEXTROMETHORPHAN; ACCUMULATION; AGONIST	This study establishes the expression of appreciable populations of sites on mouse lung membranes that exhibit radioligand binding properties and pharmacology consistent with assignment as sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors. Specific binding of the sigma(1) receptor radioligand [H-3](+)-pentazocine reached steady state within 6 h at 37 degrees C. Saturation studies revealed high affinity binding to a single class of sites (K-d 1.36 +/- 0.04 nM; B-max 967 +/- 11 fmol/mg protein). Inhibition studies showed appropriate sigma1 receptor pharmacology, including higher affinity for (+)-N-allylnormetazocine with respect to the (-)-enantiomer, and positive allosteric modulation of dextromethorphan binding by phenytoin. Using [H-3]1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine in the presence of (+)-pentazocine to assess sigma(2) receptor binding, steady state was achieved within 2 min at 25 degrees C. Cold saturation studies revealed one high affinity, low capacity binding site (K-d 31.8 +/- 8.3 nM; B-max 921 +/- 228 fmol/mg protein) that displayed sigma(2) receptor pharmacology. A very low affinity, high capacity interaction also was observed that represents saturable, but not sigma receptor specific, binding. A panel of ligands showed rank order inhibition of radioligand binding appropriate for the sigma(2) receptor, with ifenprodil displaying the highest apparent affinity. In vivo, dextromethorphan inhibited the specific binding of a radioiodinated sigma(1) receptor ligand in lung with an ED50 of 1.2 mu mol/kg, a value near the recommended dosage for the drug as a cough suppressant. Overall, the present work provides a foundation for studies of drug interactions with pulmonary sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors in vitro and in vivo. Published by Elsevier B.V.

New Allosteric Modulators of AMPA Receptors: Synthesis and Study of Their Functional Activity by Radioligand-Receptor Binding Analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						AMPA receptor allosteric modulators; CNS pathologies; radioligand binding; [H-3]PAM-43; cross-coupling reaction; heterogeneous hydrogenation	GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; IN-VITRO; SYSTEM; CYCLOTHIAZIDE; POTENTIATOR; REDUCTION; MECHANISM; PROFILE	The synthetic approaches to three new AMPA receptor modulators-derivatives of 1,11-dimethyl-3,6,9-triazatricyclo[7.3.1.1(3,11)]tetradecane-4,8,12-trione-had been developed and all steps of synthesis were optimized. The structures of the compounds contain tricyclic cage and indane fragments necessary for binding with the target receptor. Their physiological activity was studied by radioligand-receptor binding analysis using [H-3]PAM-43 as a reference ligand, which is a highly potent positive allosteric modulator of AMPA receptors. The results of radioligand-binding studies indicated the high potency of two synthesized compounds to bind with the same targets as positive allosteric modulator PAM-43 (at least on AMPA receptors). We suggest that the Glu-dependent specific binding site of [H-3]PAM-43 or the receptor containing this site may be one of the targets of the new compounds. We also suggest that enhanced radioligand binding may indicate the existence of synergistic effects of compounds 11b and 11c with respect to PAM-43 binding to the targets. At the same time, these compounds may not compete directly with PAM-43 for its specific binding sites but bind to other specific sites of this biotarget, changing its conformation and thereby causing a synergistic effect of cooperative interaction. It can be expected that the newly synthesized compounds will also have pronounced effects on the glutamatergic system of the mammalian brain.	[Golubeva, Elena A. A.; Lavrov, Mstislav I.

The serotonin subtype-4 (5-HT(4)) receptor has discrete and very similar distributions in rodent and primate brain. This receptor population may play a role in normal cognition and memory and is perhaps perturbed in some neuropsychiatric disorders. SB 207710 [(1-butyl-4-piperidinylmethyl)-8-amino-7-iodo-1,4-benzodioxan-5-carboxylate] is a selective high-affinity antagonist at 5-HT(4) receptors. We explored radioiodinated SB 207710 as a possible radioligand for imaging 5-HT(4) receptors in vivo. Rats were injected intravenously with iodine-125 labelled SB 207710, euthanised at known times and dissected to establish radioactivity content in brain tissues. Radioactivity entered brain but cleared rapidly and to a high extent from blood and plasma. Between 45 and 75 min after injection, the ratios of radioactivity concentration in each of 12 selected brain tissues to that in receptor-poor cerebellum correlated with previous measures of 5-HT(4) receptor density distribution in vitro. The highest ratio was about 3.4 in striatum. SB 207710 was labelled with iodine-123 by an iododestannylation procedure. A cynomolgus monkey was injected intravenously with [(123)I]SB 207710 and examined by SPET. Maximal whole brain uptake of radioactivity was 2.3% of the injected dose at 18 min after radioligand injection. Brain images acquired between 9 and 90 min showed high radioactivity uptake in 5-HT(4) receptor-rich regions, such as striatum, and low uptake in receptor-poor cerebellum. At 169 min the ratio of radioactivity concentration in striatum to that in cerebellum was 4.0. In a second SPET experiment, the cynomolgus monkey was pretreated with a selective 5-HT(4) receptor antagonist, SB 204070, at 20 min before [(123)I]SB 207710 injection. Radioactivity in all brain regions was reduced almost to the level in cerebellum by 176 min after radioligand injection. These findings show that [(123)I]SB 207710 is an effective radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT(4) receptors in vivo.

They provide basically the same capabilities as the latter, but an unlabeled reporter ligand is used instead of a radioligand. The study presented herein describes the development of MS Binding Assays that address D-1 and D-5 dopamine receptors. A highly sensitive, rapid and robust LC-ESI-MS/MS quantification method for the selective D-1 dopamine receptor antagonist SCH23390 ((5R)-8-chloro-3-methyl-5-phenyl-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-7-ol) was established and validated, using its 8-bromo analogue SKF83566 as an internal standard. This quantification method proved to be suitable for the characterization of SCH23390 binding to human D-1 and D-5 receptors. Following the concept of MS Binding Assays, saturation experiments for D-1 and D-5 receptors were performed, as well as competition experiments for D-1 receptors. The results obtained are in good agreement with results from radioligand binding assays and therefore indicate that the established MS Binding Assays addressing D-1 and D-5 receptors are well-suited substitutes for radioligand binding assays, the technique that has so far dominated affinity determinations toward these targets.

In this report, the radiosynthesis of a novel PDE2A radioligand and the subsequent biological evaluation were described. Our prospective compound 1-(2-chloro-5-methoxy phenyl)-8-(2-fluoropyridin-4-yl)-3- methylbenzo[e]imidazo[5,1-c][1,2,4]triazine, benzoimidazotriazine (BIT1) (IC50 PDE2A = 3.33 nM; 16-fold selectivity over PDE10A) was fluorine-18 labeled via aromatic nucleophilic substitution of the corresponding nitro precursor using the K[F-18]F-K-2.2.2-carbonate complex system. The new radioligand [F-18]BIT1 was obtained with a high radiochemical yield (54 +/- 2%, n = 3), a high radiochemical purity (>= 99%), and high molar activities (155-175 GBq/mu mol, n = 3). In vitro autoradiography on pig brain cryosections exhibited a heterogeneous spatial distribution of [F-18]BIT1 corresponding to the known pattern of expression of PDE2A. The investigation of in vivo metabolism of [F-18]BIT1 in a mouse revealed sufficient metabolic stability. PET studies in mouse exhibited a moderate brain uptake of [F-18]BIT1 with a maximum standardized uptake value of 0.7 at 5 min p.i. However, in vivo blocking studies revealed a non-target specific binding of [F-18]BIT1. Therefore, further structural modifications are needed to improve target selectivity.

A cell membrane stationary phase (CMSP) was prepared by immobilizing rat cerebrum cell membrane on the surface of a silica carrier and used for rapid on-line chromatographic evaluation of ligand binding affinity to mAChR. Comparison of the results with affinity rank orders obtained from radioligand-binding assays using the same cerebrum membrane indicated a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.8640, n = 18, P < 0.0001) between the data sets and proved that CMC can be used to evaluate drug-receptor affinity for drug candidates.

The plant extracts were evaluated by a 96-well microplate filtration-based radioligand competitive assay, centered on the ability of the plant extracts to competitively displace the radioligand, [H-3]N -methylscopolamine, from binding to the muscarinic membrane receptors. The screening assay was initially carried out at 50 mu g/assay point, and those showing inhibition at and above 61% were retested at 10 mu g/assay point. The extracts of Ficus septica Burm. f.

The AstraZeneca compound AZD9272 has previously been labeled with carbon-11 and used as a PET radioligand for mGluR5 receptor binding. The molecular structure of AZD9272 allows one to label the molecule with fluorine-18 without altering the structure. The aim of this study was to develop a fluorine-18 analogue of AZD9272 and to examine its binding distribution in the nonhuman primate brain in vivo as well as to obtain whole body radiation dosimetry. F-18-AZD9272 was successfully synthesized from a nitro precursor. The radioligand was stable, with a radiochemical purity of >99% at 2 h after formulation in a sterile phosphate buffered solution (pH = 7.4). After injection of F-18-AZD9272 in two cynomolgus monkeys, the maximum whole brain radioactivity concentration was 4.9-6.7% of the injected dose (n = 2) and PET images showed a pattern of regional radioactivity consistent with that previously obtained for C-11-AZD9272. The percentage of parent radioligand in plasma was 59 and 64% (n = 2) at 120 min after injection of F-18-AZD9272, consistent with high metabolic stability. Two whole body PET scans were performed in nonhuman primates for a total of 231 min after injection of F-18-AZD9272. Highest uptakes were seen in liver and small intestine, followed by brain and kidney. The estimated effective dose was around 0.017 mSv/MBq. F-18-AZD9272 shows suitable properties as a PET radioligand for in vivo imaging of binding in the primate brain. F-18-labeled AZD9272 offers advantages over C-11-AZD9272 in terms of higher image resolution, combined with a longer half-life. Moreover, based on the distribution and the estimated radiation burden, imaging of F-18-AZD9272 could be used as an improved tool for quantitative assessment and characterization of AZD9272 binding sites in the human brain by using PET.

The radioligand of choice for such measurements on the cholinergic system is the muscarinic receptor antagonist N-[1-C-11]propyl-3-piperidyl benzilate (PPB). In an effort to overcome the shortcomings with the technically cumbersome synthesis of [C-11]PPB, we designed and synthesized four structurally related analogues of PPB, of which (S,R)-1-methylpiperidin-3-yl)2-cyclopentyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate (1) was found to bind muscarinic receptors with similar affinity as PPB (3.5 vs 7.9 nM, respectively). (S,R)-1 was radiolabeled via (NC)-C-11-methylation at high radiochemical purity (>99%) and high specific radioactivity (>130 GBq/mu mol). In vitro studies by autoradiography on human brain tissue and in vivo studies by PET in nonhuman primates demonstrated excellent signal-to-noise ratios and a kinetic profile in brain comparable to that of [C-11]PBB. (S,R)-[C-11]1 is a promising candidate for measuring changes in endogenous acetylcholine concentrations.

In-depth knowledge of functional imaging nuances is critically needed for precise prognostication and guidance of management. Here, we review theranostic applications with up to Phase III type evidence for outcome improvement: Imaging and therapy of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN) exploiting high levels of somatostatin receptor (SSTR) expression and radiotheranostics of prostate cancer targeting the prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). This narrative review focusses on these two applications and elucidates patient selection and response assessment by radioligand scintigraphy and/or positron emission tomography. Furthermore, we provide a brief outlook on future applications for novel targets outside of NEN and prostate cancer.

In membranes from the rat striatum, binding was saturable, reversible and temperature-dependent. Analysis of saturation isotherms indicated that [H-3]ZM241385 bound with high affinity (K-d of 0.84 nM). high density (1680 fmol mg protein(-1)) and with a high proportion of specific binding (93% at 1 nM radioligand). Examination of competition profiles indicated that [H-3]ZM241385 bound to sites with an A,, adenosine receptor-like rank order. The presence of guanosine 5'-(3-thio)-triphosphate failed to alter either [SH]ZM241385 binding or agonist competition for [H-3]ZM241385 binding. Autoradiographic analysis of [H-3]ZM241385 binding to frozen sections of rat brain indicated specific binding to the rat striatum of similar affinity (K-d of 0.43 nM) and susceptibility to adenosine receptor ligands. At 1 nM [H-3]ZM241385, specific binding comprised 95 +/- 1% total binding. In the hippocampus and frontal cortex, binding of [H-3]ZM241385 failed to saturate and was of lower density. Taken together, these results indicate that [H-3]ZM241385 should prove to be a useful radioligand in the characterisation of adenosine A(2A) receptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

The radioligand presently used for in vitro studies of the sigma(1) receptor, [H-3](+)-pentazocine, has significant limitations; it is difficult to synthesize, has limited chemical stability, and can be problematic to obtain. Evaluation of a series of novel 2(3H)-benzothiazolone compounds revealed SN56 to have sub-nanomolar and preferential affinity for the sigma(1) subtype, relative to sigma(2) and non-sigma, binding sites. The goal of this study was to characterize the binding of [H-3]-SN56 to sigma(1) receptors isolated from rat brain. Standard in vitro binding techniques were utilized to 1) determine the specificity and affinity of binding to sigma(1) receptors, 2) confirm that [H-3]-SN56 labels sites previously identified as sigma(1) by comparing binding to sites labeled by [H-3](+)-pentazocine, and 3) characterize the kinetics of binding. The results indicate that [H-3]-SN56 exhibits 1) specific, saturable, and reversible binding to the sigma(1) receptor, with B-max = 340 +/- 10 fmol/mg and K-d = 0.069 +/- 0.0074 nM, 2) competitive displacement by classical sigma compounds, yielding sigma K-1(i) values consistent with those reported in the literature, and 3) binding kinetics compatible with a 90 mm incubation, and filtration for separation of free and bound radioligand. The results of these studies suggest that [H-3]-SN56 may serve as a viable alternative to [H-3](+)-pentazocine in radioligand binding assays. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

MS-binding assays:: Kinetic, saturation, and competitive experiments based on quantitation of bound marker as exemplified by the GABA transporter mGAT1	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article								A new kind of binding assay is described in which the amount of a nonlabeled marker bound to the target is quantified by LC-ESI-MS-MS. This new approach was successfully implemented with nonlabeled NO 771 as marker and the GABA transporter subtype mGAT7 as target. The native marker bound to the target was liberated from the receptor protein by methanol denaturation after filtration. A reliable and sensitive LC-ESI-MS-MS method for the quantitation of NO 711 was developed, and data from mass spectrometric detection were analyzed by nonlinear regression. Kinetic MS-binding experiments yielded values for k(+1) and k(-1) While in saturation MS-binding experiments, K-d and B-max values were determined. In competitive MS-binding experiments, K-i values were obtained for various test compounds covering a broad range of affinities for mGAT1. All experiments were performed in 96-well plate format with a filter plate for the separation step which improved the efficiency and throughput of the procedure. The method was validated by classical radioligand-binding experiments with the labeled marker [H-3(2)]NO 771 in parallel. The results obtained from MS-binding experiments were found to be in good agreement with the results of the radioligand-binding assays. The new kind of MS-binding assay presented herein is further adapted to the conventional radioligand-binding assay in that the amount of bound marker is securely quantified. This promises easy implementation in accordance with conventional binding assays without the major drawbacks that are inherent in radioligand or fluorescence binding assays. Therefore, MS-binding assays are a true alternative to classical radioligand-binding assays.

Methods for quantifying radioligand metabolites in brain tissue include ex vivo studies in small animals or labeling and imaging of the radiometabolite(s) of interest. The latter is a time- and resource-demanding process, which often includes multistep organic synthesis. We hypothesized that this process could be replaced by making use of liver microsomes, an in vitro system that mimics metabolism. In this study, rat liver microsomes were used to prepare radiometabolites of the dopamine transporter radioligand [F-18]FE-PE2I for in vitro imaging using autoradiography and in vivo imaging using PET in rats and nonhuman primates. The primary investigated hydroxy-metabolite [F-18]FE-PE2I-OH ([F-18]2) was obtained in a 2% radiochemical yield and >99% radiochemical purity. In vitro and in vivo imaging demonstrated that [F-18]2 readily crossed the blood-brain barrier and bound specifically and reversibly to the dopamine transporter. In conclusions, the current study demonstrates the potential of liver microsomes in the production of radiometabolites for translational imaging studies and radioligand discovery.

Dosimetric analysis of a compartmental model for radioligand uptake in tumor lesions	BIOMEDICAL PHYSICS & ENGINEERING EXPRESS			English	Article						nuclear medicine; dosimetry; radioligand therapy; mathematical model	PET	Radioligand therapy is a targeted cancer therapy that delivers radiation to tumor cells based on the expression of specific markers on the cell surface. It has become an important treatment option in metastasized neuroendocrine tumors and advanced prostate cancer. The analysis of absorbed doses in radioligand therapies has gained much attention and remains a challenging task due to individual pharmacokinetics. As an alternative to the often used sum of exponential functions in intra-therapeutic dosimetry, a basic compartmental model for the pharmacokinetics of radioligands is described and analyzed in this paper. In its simplest version, the model behavior is determined by the uptake capacity and the association constant and can be solved analytically. The model is extended with rates for excretion from the source compartment and externalization from the lesion compartment. Numerical calculations offer an insight into the quantitative effects of the model parameters on the absorbed dose in the tumor lesion. This analysis helps understanding the importance of clinically relevant factors, e.g. the effect on absorbed doses of modified radioligands that bind to albumin. Using clinical data, the potential application in intra-therapeutic dosimetry is illustrated and compared to the bi-exponential function which lacks a mechanistical basis. While the compartmental model is found to constitute a feasible alternative in these examples, this has to be confirmed by further clinical studies.	[Galler, M.; Chibolela, C.; Rogasch, J. M.

This study aimed to report the synthesis and evaluation of an F-18-labeled 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline analog as a potential BACE1 radioligand. A fluoropropyl side chain was introduced to the phenyl of this 3,4-dihydroquinazoline scaffold to generate the radioligand. Our preliminary data indicated that although the 2-amino-3,4-dihydroquinazoline scaffold possessed favorable in-vitro properties as a PET ligand, its poor brain uptake hindered the invivo imaging of BACE1. Further investigation would be required to optimize the scaffold for the development of a blood-brain-barrier-permeable BACE1-targeted PET ligand.

The affinity of newly synthesized ligands is assessed by radioligand receptor binding assays. Based on our previous studies, 2-phenyl-5-oxo-7-methyl-1,3, 4-oxadiazolo[a, 2,3]-pyrimidine (compound A) was chosen for design and synthesis of new triazole derivatives as GABA(A) BZD receptor agonist. The cortical membrane of male Sprague-Dawley rats was prepared as the source of the BZD receptors. Different concentrations of membrane protein and [H-3]-flumazenil were incubated at room temperature at different time periods to reach the steady-state. To saturate the receptors, increased amounts of radioligand were incubated with membrane protein. The bound and un-bound ligands were separated by centrifugation. The affinity of compound A was measured in competition studies at optimum conditions by displacement of [H-3]-Flumazenil from rat cortical membrane. Based on results, the optimum conditions of radioligand receptor binding assay of benzodiazepines were 35 min incubation of ligands with 100 mu g cortical membrane protein and 8.6 x 10(-5) nmole H-3-flumazenil in a final volume of 0.5 mL Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7.4) at 30 degrees C. The binding parameters of [3H]-flumazenil, B-max and K-d were determined through saturation studies as 0.638 +/- 0.099 pmol/mg and 1.35 +/- 0.316 nM respectively. The affinity of compound A was 1.9 nM comparable with diazepam (1.53nM). This finding makes the compound an interesting lead for further optimization. Starting from this compound, new ligands were synthesized and screened in-vitro by competitive binding assays.

We have chosen ICI 89,406, a beta(1)-selective AR antagonist, as the lead structure to develop new beta(1)-AR radioligands for PET and have synthesised a fluoro-ethoxy derivative (F-ICI). Methods: (S)-N-[2-[3-(2-Cyano-phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-propylamino]-ethyl]-N'-[4-(2-[F-18]fluoro-ethoxy)-phenyl]-urea ((S)-[E-18]F-ICI) was synthesised. Myocardial uptake of radioactivity after intravenous injection of (S)-[F-18]F-ICT into adult CD1 mice or Wistar rats was assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) and postmortem dissection. Metabolism was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of plasma and urine. Results: The heart was visualised with PET after injection of (S)-[E-18]F-ICI but neither unlabelled F-ICI nor propranolol (non-selective beta-AR antagonist) injected 15 min after (S)-[F-18]F-ICI affected myocardial radioactivity. Ex vivo dissection demonstrated that predosing with propranolol or CGP 20712 (beta(1)-selective AR-antagonist) did not affect myocardial radioactivity. Radiometabolites rapidly appeared in plasma and both (S)-[F-18]F-ICI and radiometabolites accumulated in urine. Conclusions: Myocardial uptake of (S)-[F-18]F-ICI after intravenous injection was mainly at sites unrelated to beta(1)-ARs. (S)-[F-18]F-ICI is not a suitable beta(1)-selective-AR radioligand for PET.

Direct labelling of the human P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor and identification of positive and negative cooperativity of binding	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X(7) receptor; radioligand binding; ATP; KN62; PPADS; suramin; BzATP	OSTEOSARCOMA CELLS; HUMAN-LYMPHOCYTES; OXIDIZED ATP; ANTAGONISTS; EXPRESSION; CHANNELS; PHARMACOLOGY; SUBTYPES; CATIONS; MODEL	Background and Purpose: The P2X(7) receptor exhibits complex pharmacological properties. In this study, binding of a [H-3]labelled P2X(7) receptor antagonist to human P2X(7) receptors has been examined to further understand ligand interactions with this receptor. Experimental Approach: The P2X(7) receptor antagonist, N-[2-({2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethyl}amino)-5-quinolinyl]-2tricyclo[ 3.3.1.1(3,7)]dec-1-ylacetamide (compound-17), was radiolabelled with tritium and binding studies were performed using membranes prepared from U-2 OS or HEK293 cells expressing human recombinant P2X(7) receptors. Key Results: Binding of [H-3]-compound-17 was higher in membranes prepared from cells expressing P2X(7) receptors than from control cells and was inhibited by ATP suggesting labelled sites represented human P2X(7) receptors. Binding was reversible, saturable and modulated by P2X(7) receptor ligands (Brilliant Blue G, KN62, ATP, decavanadate). Furthermore, ATP potency was reduced in the presence of divalent cations or NaCl. Radioligand binding exhibited both positive and negative cooperativity. Positive cooperativity was evident from bell shaped Scatchard plots, reduction in radioligand dissociation rate by unlabelled compound-17 and enhancement of radioligand binding by KN62 and unlabelled compound-17. ATP and decavanadate inhibited binding in a negative cooperative manner as they enhanced radioligand dissociation. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that human P2X(7) receptors can be directly labelled and provide novel insights into receptor function. The positive cooperativity observed suggests that binding of compound-17 to one subunit in the P2X(7) receptor complex enhances subsequent binding to other P2X(7) subunits in the same complex. The negative cooperative effects of ATP suggest that ATP and compound-17 bind at separate, interacting, sites on the P2X(7) receptor.

Saturation binding experiments revealed that [H-3]WAY100635 binds to a single class of receptors with very high apparent affinity (K-D = 87 +/- 4 pM, B-max = 15.1 +/- 0.2 fmol/mg protein). The binding was almost irreversible, as the dissociation rate constant obtained k(off) = (7.8 +/- 1.1) x 10(-3) min(-1), means that equilibrium with this radioligand cannot be achieved before 7.5 h incubation at 25 degrees C. Systematic association kinetic studies of [H-3]WAY100635 binding revealed sharp reaction acceleration at higher radioligand concentration, proposing mechanism of positive cooperativity. The affinities of antagonists determined from competition with [H-3]WAY100635 did not coincide with their abilities to inhibit 5-HT-dependent activation of [H-35]GTP gamma S binding probably due to the ligand's kinetic peculiarities. Thus, [H-3]WAY100635 appears to be an excellent tool for determining receptor binding sites, but its applicability in equilibrium studies is strongly limited.

At least two different ways of [35S]dATPalphaS interaction with the membranes were distinguished on the basis of radioligand on-rate. Firstly, the binding sites characterized by 'fast' on-rate can be observed. Secondly, the 'slow' binding sites were kinetically identified and quantified. As in both cases the bound radioligand could be displaced by excess of ATP, all these binding sites can be defined as 'specific sites'. In the 'slow' binding sites isomerization of the receptor-ligand complex was observed, as is typical for interaction of antagonists with G-protein coupled receptors, and the kinetic parameters for this interaction were similar with the appropriate data for the hP2Y(1) receptors expressed in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells Therefore these sites could be assigned to the same receptor subtype in brain membranes while the 'fast' binding sites belong to other membrane-bound proteins, also interacting with ATP and its analogues. The kinetic properties of the latter sites were not analysed in detail. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Hence, the binding of [H-3]mazindol to the dopamine transporter in caudate-putamen tissue homogenates or frozen tissue sections apposed to either autoradiographic film or phosphor imaging plates was measured. Estimates of binding affinity were similar for homogenate studies and phosphor imaging plates (Kd = 6.44 +/- 0.14 and 6.91 +/- 0.47 nM, respectively), but higher values were obtained with film autoradiography (Kd = 11.31 +/- 0.82 nM). The density of binding was similar for both autoradiographic techniques (Bmax = 371.9 +/- 30.8 fmol/mg estimated tissue equivalent, ETE (imaging plate) and 425 +/- 13.77 fmol/mg ETE (film)), although lower values were obtained from tissue homogenates (Bmax = 64.27 +/- 6.74 fmol/mg wet weight). These results suggest that high resolution phosphor imaging can be used to analyse radioligand binding parameters in human brain tissue. Moreover, the reduced exposure time of phosphor imaging plates (e.g. 7 days vs 5 weeks) allows results to be obtained more rapidly than with conventional film autoradiography.

The present study introduces improved competitive binding assays for the rapid and sensitive evaluation of the binding affinities of TDCs for integrin alpha(v)beta(3). Based on different probes, two assays were modified: a fluorescence competitive binding assay and a radioligand competitive binding assay. The chemicals tested included the known TH, 3,3',5,5'-tetraiodo-L-thyronine (T4); a deaminated analog of T4, tetraiodothyroacetic acid (tetrac); and phthalate esters (PAEs). The relative binding potency of T4 was studied, and the concentration required to displace 50% of the ligands from their receptors (RIC50) of T4 was 4.9 x 10(5) and 9.7 x 10(4) nM for the fluorescence and radioligand competitive binding assays, respectively, suggesting that the radioligand competitive binding assay might be more sensitive for the evaluation of the binding affinity for integrin alpha(v)beta(3). The three PAEs, including diethyl hexyl phthalate (DEHP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP) and dibutyl phthalate (DnBP), demonstrated binding affinities for integrin alpha(v)beta(3) in the following order of potency: DnBP > DEHP > BBP tested by the radioligand competitive binding assay. A docking simulation of each of the three PAEs with integrin alpha(v)beta(3) confirmed the calculated binding energies, which had a strong positive relationship with the log RIC20 values of the 3 PAEs (R = 0.99, p < 0.001). The present study shows that the established radioligand competitive binding assay could be used as a valuable tool for quantifying the affinity of TDCs for integrin alpha(v)beta(3).

Here we characterized and longitudinally assessed the novel radioligand [C-11]CHDI-626 for mHTT PET imaging in the zQ175DN mouse model of HD. Methods After evaluating radiometabolites and radioligand kinetics, we conducted longitudinal dynamic PET imaging at 3, 6, 9, and 13 months of age (M) in wild-type (WT, n = 17) and heterozygous (HET, n = 23) zQ175DN mice. Statistical analysis was performed to evaluate temporal and genotypic differences. Cross-sectional cohorts at each longitudinal time point were included for post-mortem [H-3]CHDI-626 autoradiography. Results Despite fast metabolism and kinetics, the radioligand was suitable for PET imaging of mHTT. Longitudinal quantification could discriminate between genotypes already at premanifest stage (3 M), showing an age-associated increase in signal in HET mice in parallel with mHTT aggregate load progression, as supported by the post-mortem [H-3]CHDI-626 autoradiography. Conclusion With clinical evaluation underway, [C-11]CHDI-626 PET imaging appears to be a suitable preclinical candidate marker to monitor natural HD progression and for the evaluation of mHTT-lowering therapies.

This imaging approach has promise for diagnostic purposes and evaluation of disease-modifying therapies. Broad clinical use requires an F-18-labeled amyloid-beta radioligand with high specific and low nonspecific binding. The aim of the present PET study was to examine the radioligand F-18-AZD4694 in human subjects. Methods: Six control subjects and 10 clinically diagnosed AD patients underwent PET examination with F-18-AZD4694 and a structural MRI scan. Of these, 4 controls and 4 patients underwent a second PET examination for test-retest analysis. Arterial sampling was done to derive a metabolite-corrected plasma input function for traditional compartment modeling. Besides, several simplified quantitative approaches were applied, including the reference Logan approach and simple ratio methods. Results: After intravenous injection of F-18-AZD4694, radioactivity appeared rapidly in brain. In patients, radioactivity was high in regions expected to contain amyloid-b, whereas in controls, radioactivity was low and homogenously distributed. Binding in cerebellum, a reference region, was low and similar between the groups. Specific binding was reversible and peaked at about 27 min after injection in regions with high radioactivity. The time-activity curves could be described using the 2-tissue-compartment model. Distribution volume ratio estimates obtained using compartment models and simplified methods were highly correlated. Standardized uptake value ratios calculated at late times and distribution volume ratios estimated with the reference Logan approach were, in gray matter, significantly lower in control subjects (1.08 [11%] and 1.01 [6%], respectively) than in AD patients (2.15 [24%] and 1.62 [18%], respectively). Among non-invasive methods, the lowest test-retest variability was found with reference Logan, varying between 4% and 6% across brain regions. Conclusion: Noninvasive quantitative approaches provide valid estimates of amyloid-b binding. Because of the radioisotope (F-18) used for labeling, the radioligand has potential for wide clinical application. F-18-AZD4694 satisfies the requirements for a promising amyloid-beta radioligand both for diagnostic use and for evaluation of disease-modifying therapies in AD.

Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT enables accurate detection of mCRPC lesions with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and provides quantitative and reproducible data that can be used to select patients for PRLT and therapeutic monitoring. Our comprehensive experience over the last 3 years using different radioligands indicates that PRLT is highly effective for the treatment of mCRPC, even in advanced cases, and potentially lends a significant benefit to overall and progression-free survival. Additionally, significant improvement in clinical symptoms and excellent palliation of pain can be achieved.

In vitro and in vivo tests showed that the cyclohexanecarboxamide derivative is a reversible, selective and high affinity 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (IC50 = 0.29 nM, k(i) = 0.18 nM) with high brain uptake, slow brain clearance and stability to defluorination when compared with conventional standards.

Herein we describe the in vivo evaluation of [F-18]FECIMBI-36 in vervet/African green monkeys by PET imaging. PET images show that [F-18]FECIMBI-36 penetrates the blood-brain barrier and a low retention of radioactivity is observed in monkey brain. Although the time activity curves indicate a somehow heterogeneous distribution of the radioligand in the brain, the low level of [F-18]FECIMBI-36 in brain may limit the use of this tracer for quantification of 5-HT2A/2C receptors by PET.

This paper assesses and summarises various different modeling strategies for the quantitative analysis of the radioligand. The models considered are based on a compartmental description of the ligands behaviour and include both plasma input analyses, requiring the additional monitoring of blood activity, and a reference tissue approach, which relies solely on the tomographic tissue data. Parameter estimates of specific binding are presented for a set of test-retest data, obtained from six normal volunteers who were scanned on two separate occasions, allowing for an assessment of normal binding values and their reproducibility, NUCL MED BIOL 27;5:477-482, 2000.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether the stereochemistry of the incorporated ibuprofen affects the radioligand's in vitro and in vivo properties and to select the more favorable radioligand for further development. For this purpose, SibuDAB and RibuDAB containing (S)- and (R)-ibHprofen, respectively, were synthesized and labeled with lutetium-177. In vitro, the two isomers had similar properties; however, [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB showed increased binding to mouse and human plasma proteins (91 +/- 1 and 88 +/- 2%, respectively) compared to[Lu-177]Lu-RibuDAB (75 +/- 2 and 79 +/- 2%, respectively). In vivo, [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB was metabolically more stable than [Lu-177]Lu-RibuDAB with similar to 90 vs similar to 67% intact radioligand detected in the blood at 4 h post injection (p.i.). In line with the lower albumin-binding affinity, the blood clearance of [Lu-177]Lu-RibuDAB in mice was considerably faster [27% of injected activity (% IA), 1 h p.i.] than for [Lu-177]-Lu-SibuDAB (50% IA, 1 h p.i.). Time-dependent biodistribution studies performed in tumor-bearing athymic nude mice showed high PSMA-specific tumor uptake for both isomers. A twofold increased area under the curve (AUC(0 -> 8d)) of the blood retention was determined for FlidLu-SibuDAB as compared to [Lu-177]Lu-RibuDAB, whereas the kidney AUC(0 -> 8d) value of [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB was only half as high as for [Lu-177]Lu-RibuDAB. As a result, a more favorable tumor-to-kidney AUC(0 -> 8d) ratio was obtained for [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB, which was also visualized on SPECT/CT images. Based on its improved kidney clearance and higher metabolic stability, [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB was selected as the more favorable radioligand. Therapy studies performed with [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB (5 MBq/mouse) demonstrated the anticipated therapeutic superiority over the current gold-standard [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (5 MBq/mouse). The significantly increased survival time of mice treated with [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB as compared to those injected with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 justifies further development of this novel radioligand toward clinical application.

Methods: Regional brain distributions of (-)-[F-18]FEOBV in mice were determined using ex vivo dissection. MicroPET imaging was used to determine the regional brain pharmacokinetics of the radioligand in rat and rhesus monkey brains. Results: In all three species, clear heterogeneous regional brain distributions were obtained, with the rank order of brain tissues (striatum>thalamus>cortex>cerebellum) consistent with the distribution of cholinergic nerve terminals containing the VAChT. Conclusions: (-)-[F-18]FEOBV remains a viable candidate for further development as an in vivo imaging agent for positron emission tomography (PET) Studies of the VAChT in the human brain.

The present study was performed to find reasons for the common observation of rapid metabolism of receptor radioligands during time of a brain PET scan. To this aim, the 1-h phase during which imaging-data are acquired was evaluated by using a pharmacokinetic approach. The values of half-lives, volumes of distribution, and dilution calculated for a set of metabolite corrected plasma curves of D2-receptor radioligand [11C]raclopride (PETc) during 50 min after radioligand injection in tracer dose were compared with the reference values obtained from a set of plasma curves (REFc) during 30 h after i.v. infusion of unlabelled raclopride in pharmacological doses. We found that the half-life of PETc correspond to the distribution half-life of REFc. Accordingly, the distribution volume during the terminal phase of PETc (13.6 +/- 10.8 L) was significantly lower than that during the terminal phase (82.2 +/- 30.5 L) and at steady state (59.4 +/- 20 L) for REFc, and the dilution of raclopride in body for PETc at 50?min was 38 L, whereas it was 1015 L for REFc at 30 h. The [11C]raclopride in plasma at 50 min was higher (10% of dose) than the value for unlabelled raclopride at 30 h (4%). We concluded that the kinetic behavior of the radiolabelled drug [11C]raclopride during the 1?h time of a PET corresponds to the distribution phase.

The characteristics of [C-11]T-773, a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand with high binding affinity and selectivity for PDE10A, were evaluated in autoradiography and in nonhuman primate (NHP) PET. Brain PET measurements were performed under baseline conditions and after administration of a selective PDE10A inhibitor, MP-10. Total distribution volume (V-T) and binding potential (BPND) were calculated using various kinetic models. Whole body PET measurements were performed to calculate the effective dose of [C-11]T-773. Autoradiography studies in postmortem human and monkey brain sections showed high accumulation of [C-11]T-773 in the striatum and substantia nigra which was blocked by MP-10. Brain PET showed high accumulation of [C-11]T-773 in the striatum, and the data could be fitted using a two tissue compartment model. BPND was approximately 1.8 in the putamen when the cerebellum was used as the reference region. Approximately 70% of PDE10A binding was occupied by 1.8 mg/kg of MP-10. Whole body PET showed high accumulation of [C-11]T-773 in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain in the initial phase. The radioligand was partly excreted via bile and the gastrointestinal tract, and partly excreted through the urinary tract. The calculated effective dose was 0.007 mSv/MBq. In conclusion, [C-11]T-773 was demonstrated to be a promising PET radioligand for PDE10A with favorable brain kinetics. Dosimetry results support multiple PET measurements per person in human studies. Further research is required with [C-11]T-773 in order to test the radioligand's potential clinical applications.

To determine the potential of the radioligand as a 5-HT2A tracer, regional brain biodistribution and displacement studies will be performed. The influence of P-glycoprotein blocking oil the brain uptake of the radioligand will also be investigated. Methods: A regional brain biodistribution Study and a displacement study with ketanserin were performed with [I-123]-3-I-CO. Also, the influence of cyclosporin A (50 mg/kg) oil the brain distribution of the radioligand was investigated. For the displacement study, ketanserin (1 mg/kg) was administered 30 min after injection of [I-123]-3-I-CO. Results: The initial brain uptake of [I-123]-3-I-CO was quite high, but a rapid wash-out of radioactivity was observed. Cortex-to-cerebellum binding index ratios were low (1.1 - 1.7), indicating considerable aspecific binding and a low specific 'signal' of the radioligand. Tracer uptake was reduced to the levels in cerebellum (a 60% reduction) after ketanserin displacement. Administration of cyclosporin A resulted in a doubling of the brain radioactivity concentration. Conclusions: Although [I-123]-3-I-CO showed adequate brain uptake and could be displaced by ketanserin, high aspecific binding to brain tissue was responsible for very low cortex-to-cerebellum binding index ratios, possibly limiting the potential of the radioligand as a serotonin 5-HT2A receptor tracer. We also demonstrated that [I-123]-3-I-CO is probably a weak substrate for the P-glycoprotein efflux transporter. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Blanckaert, Peter B.

This invasive, costly procedure deters subjects' participation, and requires specialized staff and equipment. Simultaneous estimation (SIME) can fully quantify binding using only PET data from multiple brain regions and one individual anchor value, which is based on a single arterial blood sample. Drawing this sample can still be challenging in clinical settings, particularly when using simultaneous PET/magnetic resonance scanners. Here we propose a methodology for full quantification of binding that does not require any blood samples. The methodology substitutes the SIME blood-based anchor with a value predicted using multiple linear regression of noninvasive, easy-to-collect variables related to the radioligand blood concentration, and individual metabolism, such as injected dose, body mass index, or body surface area. As a study case, we show here the methodology in comparison to analysis with full arterial-line blood sampling in a cohort of 23 available scans with [C-11]CUMI-101, a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptors.

We aimed to evaluate the acceptance and use of PSMA theranostics among German urologists. Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire was sent via survio.com to the members of the German Society of Urology (DGU). Results: Seventy-two percent of participants performed PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) imaging regularly in biochemically recurrent PCa. Overall, 61% of participants considered PSMA-radioligand therapy to be very useful or extremely useful. PSMA PET imaging in high-risk PCa is more often considered by urologists working in a university setting than in nonuniversity settings or medical practices (51% vs. 25%, p < 0.001). Most perform PSMA-radioligand therapy as an option after all approved systemic treatments for metastatic castration-resistant PCa (56%) or after cabazitaxel (14%). A total of 93.9% and 70.3% of respondents consider the lack of reimbursement by health insurance to be the main obstacle to using PSMA PET imaging or radioligand therapy, respectively. Discussion/Conclusion: PSMA-based imaging/theranostics are already widely applied but would find even more widespread use if reimbursement is clearly regulated by health insurance in Germany.

Although early experiments using radioligand assays demonstrated estrogen receptor (ER) expression, these findings were not confirmed by subsequent immunohistochemical studies which were performed with antibodies raised against ERalpha. A newly discovered estrogen receptor subtype, ERbeta, has not been previously characterized in vascular lesions. In order to verify the expression of estrogen receptors in vascular neoplasms as well as to clarify the inconsistency between radioligand and early immunohistochemical studies, we examined a series of 53 benign and malignant vascular neoplasms for ERbeta expression. All of the subtypes of vascular neoplasia examined had nuclear expression of ERbeta. The majority of cases (94%) displayed 2+ to 3+ staining. The discrepancy between radioligand studies and previous immunohistochemical studies is attributable to the use of antibodies raised against ERalpha, which is not expressed in vascular lesions, and not ERbeta, which is broadly expressed in both benign and malignant vascular neoplasms. Although ERbeta may be of limited diagnostic use in vascular neoplasia due to its broad expression, the potential exists for a therapeutic approach using ER agonists.

A membrane preparation of the cell line showed a high expression level of ETA receptors (B-max = 128 fmol/mg protein). The K-D value for [H-3] BQ-123 (K-D = 2.29 nmol/l) was comparable to that previously determined at the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-MC. The specific labeling of ETA receptors on astrocytoma 1321N1 cells by [H-3] BQ-123 was confirmed by determining the rank order of potency of a series of agonists and antagonists. A competition assay for the screening of potential ETA ligands was established and a series of new disubstituted imidazo[1,2-c] pyrimidine and pyrimido[ 1,6-a] pyrimidine derivatives was investigated. Moderate ETA affinity was detected for several derivatives [ 30 - 40% inhibition of [H-3] BQ-123 binding ( 3 nmol/l) at a concentration of 10 mu mol/l]. Astrocytoma 1321N1 cells natively express relatively high levels of ETA receptors. They are useful for the screening of potential ETA ligands in radioligand binding assays with [H-3] BQ-123.

We measured the muscarinic cholinergic receptor levels in extracts from zebrafish (Danio rerio) brain by radioligand binding techniques. Saturation binding experiments with the radioligand [H-3]-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were used to determine receptor number and relative affinity for several agonists and antagonists. Affinity at zebrafish brain receptors was relatively high with a K-d of 40 +/- 5 pM. The number of receptors, represented by B-max, was 63 +/- 16 fmol/mg protein. Oxotremorine and carbachol, agonists at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, bound with displacement curves indicating multiple binding sites. In addition, oxotremorine bound with a higher affinity than did carbachol. The antagonist potency profile at zebrafish receptors in brain was determined to be atropine much greater than pirenzipine>p-fluoro-hexahydro-siladifenidol much greater than otenzepad. The results obtained with zebrafish brain compare favorably to those found in insect, fish and mammalian species. Taken together, the binding results and favorable comparisons to mammalian systems indicate that zebrafish may provide a useful model organism for evaluating the role of cholinergic systems in learning, memory and behavior.

Preclinical evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]L-235 as a radioligand for Positron Emission Tomography cathepsin K imaging in bone	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						cathepsin K; osteoporosis; PET; CT imaging; target engagement	INHIBITORS	The cathepsin K (CatK) enzyme is abundantly expressed in osteoclasts, and CatK inhibitors have been developed for the treatment of osteoporosis. In our effort to support discovery and clinical evaluations of a CatK inhibitor, we sought to discover a radioligand to determine target engagement of the enzyme by therapeutic candidates using positron emission tomography (PET). L-235, a potent and selective CatK inhibitor, was labeled with carbon-11. PET imaging studies recording baseline distribution of [C-11]L-235, and chase and blocking studies using the selective CatK inhibitor MK-0674 were performed in juvenile and adult nonhuman primates (NHP) and ovariectomized rabbits. Retention of the PET tracer in regions expected to be osteoclast-rich compared with osteoclast-poor regions was examined. Increased retention of the radioligand was observed in osteoclast-rich regions of juvenile rabbits and NHP but not in the adult monkey or adult ovariectomized rabbit. Target engagement of CatK was observed in blocking studies with MK-0674, and the radioligand retention was shown to be sensitive to the level of MK-0674 exposure. [C-11]L-235 can assess target engagement of CatK in bone only in juvenile animals. [C-11]L-235 may be a useful tool for guiding the discovery of CatK inhibitors.

A rapid bead-based radioligand binding assay for the determination of target-binding fraction and quality control of radiopharmaceuticals	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Immunoreactivity; Lindmo assay; Target-binding fraction; Magnetic beads	IMMUNOREACTIVE FRACTION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; IN-VITRO; CANCER	Introduction: Determination of the target-binding fraction (TBF) of radiopharmaceuticals using cell-based assays is prone to inconsistencies arising from several intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Here, we report a cell-free quantitative method of analysis to determine the TBF of radioligands. Methods: Magnetic beads functionalized with Ni-NTA or streptavidin were incubated with 1 mu g of histidine-tagged or biotinylated antigen of choice for 15 min, followed by incubating 1 ng of the radioligand for 30 min. The beads, supernatant and wash fractions were measured for radioactivity on a gamma counter. The TBF was determined by quantifying the percentage of activity associated with the magnetic beads. Results: The described method works robustly with a variety of radioisotopes and class of molecules used as radioligands. The entire assay can be completed within 2 h. Conclusion: The described method yields results in a rapid and reliable manner whilst improving and extending the scope of previously described bead-based radioimmunoassays. Advances in knowledge: Using a bead-based radioligand binding assay overcomes the limitations of traditional cell-based assays. The described method is applicable to antibody as well as non-antibody based radioligands and is independent of the effect of target antigen density on cells, the choice of radioisotope used for synthesis of the radioligand and the temperature at which the assay is performed. Implications for patient care: The bead-based radioligand binding assay is significantly easier to perform and is ideally suited for adoption by the radiopharmacy as a quality control method of analysis to fulfill the criteria for release of radiopharmaceuticals in the clinic. The use of this assay is likely to ensure a more reliable validation of radiopharmaceutical quality and result in fewer failed doses, which could ultimately translate to an efficient release of radiopharmaceuticals for administration to patients in the clinic.

Autoradiographic imaging and quantification of the high-affinity GHB binding sites in rodent brain using <SUP>3</SUP>H-HOCPCA	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Quantitative autoradiography; gamma-hydroxybutyric acid; HOCPCA; Radioligand; Expression; Mouse brain development	GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID; ETHANOIC ACID; IN-VITRO; RECEPTOR; RAT; ANALOGS; RADIOLIGAND; DEFICIENCY; TARGETS; DESIGN	GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyric acid) is a compound endogenous to mammalian brain with high structural resemblance to GABA. GHB possesses nanomolar-micromolar affinity for a unique population of binding sites, but the exact nature of these remains elusive. In this study we utilized the highly selective GHB analogue, 3-hydroxycyclopent-1-enecarboxylic acid (HOCPCA) as a tritiated version (H-3-HOCPCA) to radioactively label the specific GHB high-affinity binding site and gain further insight into the density, distribution and developmental profile of this protein. We show that, in low nanomolar concentrations, 3H-HOCPCA displays excellent signal-to-noise ratios using rodent brain autoradiography, which makes it a valuable ligand for anatomical quantification of native GHB binding site levels. Our data confirmed that 3H-HOCPCA labels only the high-affinity specific GHB binding site, found in high density in cortical and hippocampal regions. The experiments revealed markedly stronger binding at pH 6.0 (K-d 73.8 nM) compared to pH 7.4 (Kd 2312 nM), as previously reported for other GHB radioligands but similar B-max values. Using H-3-HOCPCA we analyzed the GHB binding protein profile during mouse brain development. Due to the high sensitivity of this radioligand, we were able to detect low levels of specific binding already at E15 in mouse brain, which increased progressively until adulthood. Collectively, we show that H-3-HOCPCA is a highly sensitive radioligand, offering advantages over the commonly used radioligand H-3-NCS-382, and thus a very suitable in vitro tool for qualitative and quantitative autoradiography of the GHB high-affinity site.

(R)-3-(2-(methylthio)phenoxy)-N-methyl-3-phenylpropan-l-amine [(R)-thionisoxetine; 1] is a potent inhibitor of the norepinephrine transporter (NET). We aimed to label 1 with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) for evaluation as a radioligand for imaging NET in living brain with positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: Methyl 3-(2-((R)-3-(methylamino)-l-phenylpropoxy)phenylthio)-propanoate (MPPP) and 1 were each prepared from o-hydroxythiophenol in three steps. Treatment of MPPP with potassium t-butoxide and [C-11]methyl iodide in tetrahydrofuran gave [S-methyl-C-11]thionisoxetine ([C-11]1), which was purified with HPLC. The distribution of radioactivity in brain after intravenous injection of [C-11]1 into cynomolgus monkey was followed with PET and the appearance of radiometabolites in plasma monitored with radio-HPLC. Results: [C-11]1 was obtained in high yield from [C-11]methyl iodide. Of the radioactivity injected into monkey, 2.4% entered brain. Ratios of radioactivity in thalamus, mesencephalon, occipital cortex and caudate to that in cerebellum at 93 min were 1.3, 1.2, 1.2 and 1.1, respectively. The radioactivity in plasma corresponding to unchanged radioligand decreased to 53% at 45 min, with the remainder represented by hydrophilic radiometabolites. Conclusions: MPPP is an effective precursor for C-11-methylation to [C-11]1, suggesting that the S-y-propionic acid methyl ester protecting group may have wider value in the C-11-labeling of aryl methyl sulfides. However, the relatively low ratios of radioactivity to the cerebellum together with an unexpected accumulation of radioactivity in the caudate, makes [C-11]1 an unpromising NET radioligand.

The subtype selectivity and the mechanism of action of this allosteric regulation was examined. 2 In radioligand dissociation experiments each modulator accelerated dissociation from all four receptor subtypes indicating allosteric regulation. MIA displayed selectivity for the D-3 subtype for acceleration of radioligand dissociation. 3 In equilibrium binding (pseudo-competition) experiments the three compounds inhibited radioligand binding at the four receptor subtypes. Inhibition curves for D-1, D-2(short), D-2(long) and D-3 receptors were described by Hill coefficients exceeding unity and data were fitted best by a model that assumes binding of modulator to both the primary and allosteric binding sites of the receptor (the allosteric/competitive model). 4 At the D-4 subtype, Hill coefficients of unity described the binding data for amiloride and benzamii, consistent with competitive inhibition. The Hill coefficient for MIA at the D-4 subtype was less than unity and data could be fitted well by the allosteric/competitive model, but it was not possible to define unambiguously the modulatory mechanism. For this effect a better definition of the mechanism could be obtained by simultaneous analysis of data obtained in the presence of a range of concentrations of a purely competitive ligand. 5 MIA reduced the potency with which dopamine stimulated [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding at: the D-2 receptor. The effects of MIA could be described by the allosteric/competitive model with effects of MIA to inhibit the binding of dopamine but not its ability to induce a response.

[I-125]EINT binding to rat cerebral cortex membranes was saturable and reversible, and its specific binding represented approximately 90% of the total binding. [I-125]EINT labeled a single site with K-d = 0.22 +/- 0.03 nM and B-max = 583 +/- 38 fmol/mg protein. Kinetic analysis revealed a t(1/2) for association and dissociation of 20 and 24 min, respectively. Pharmacological characterization of [I-125]EINT confirmed its high specificity for the 5-HTT. The pattern of brain region distribution in vivo of intravenously administered [I-125]EINT indicated greater accumulation of the radioligand in 5-HTT-rich brain regions.

Propofol Decreases In Vivo Binding of <SUP>11</SUP>C-PBR28 to Translocator Protein (18 kDa) in the Human Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						anesthesia; cognitive impairment; neuroinflammation	C-11-FLUMAZENIL BINDING; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; PET RADIOLIGAND; RECEPTOR; TSPO; MONKEY; SEDATION/ANESTHESIA; NEUROINFLAMMATION; CHILDREN; SEDATION	The PET radioligand C-11-PBR28 targets translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) and is a potential marker of neuroimmune activation in vivo. Although several patient populations have been studied using C-11-PBR28, no investigators have studied cognitively impaired patients who would require anesthesia for the PET procedure, nor have any reports investigated the effects that anesthesia may have on radioligand uptake. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the anesthetic propofol alters brain uptake of C-11-PBR28 in healthy subjects. Methods: Ten healthy subjects (5 men; 5 women) each underwent 2 dynamic brain PET scans on the same day, first at baseline and then with intravenous propofol anesthesia. The subjects were injected with 680 +/- 14 MBq (mean +/- SD) of C-11-PBR28 for each PET scan. Brain uptake was measured as total distribution volume (V-T) using the Logan plot and metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Results: Propofol decreased V-T, which corrects for any alteration of metabolism of the radioligand, by about 26% (P = 0.011). In line with the decrease in V-T, brain time activity curves showed decreases of about 20% despite a 13% increase in plasma area under the curve with propofol. Reduction of V-T with propofol was observed across all brain regions, with no significant region X condition interaction (P = 0.40). Conclusion: Propofol anesthesia reduces the V-T of C-11-PBR28 by about 26% in the brains of healthy human subjects. Given this finding, future studies will measure neuroimmune activation in the brains of autistic volunteers and their age and sex-matched healthy controls using propofol anesthesia. We recommend that future PET studies using C-11-PBR28 and concomitant propofol anesthesia, as would be required in impaired populations, include a control arm to account for the effects of propofol on brain measurements of TSPO.

In this study, we identified two closely related P2X7 antagonists, JNJ-54232334 and JNJ-54140515, and then tritium labeled the former to produce a new radioligand for P2X7. JNJ-54232334 is a high affinity ligand for the rat P2X7 with a pK(i) of 9.3 +/- 0.1. In rat cortical membranes, [H-3] JNJ-54232334 reached saturable binding with equilibrium dissociation (K-d) constant of 4.9 +/- 13 nM. The compound displayed monophasic association and dissociation kinetics with fast on and off rates. In rat brain sections, specific binding of [H-3] JNJ-54232334 was markedly improved compared to the previously described P2X7 radioligand, [H-3] A-804598. In P2X7 knockout mouse brain sections, [H-3] A-804598 bound to non-P2X7 binding sites in contrast to [H-3] JNJ-54232334. In rat or wild type mouse brain sections [H-3] JNJ-54232334 bound in a more homogenous and region independent manner. The ubiquitous expression of P2X7 receptors was confirmed with immunohistochemistry in rat brain sections. The partial displacement of [H-3] A-804598 binding resulted in the underestimation of the level of ex vivo P2X7 occupancy for JNJ-54140515. Higher levels of P2X7 ex vivo occupancy were measured using [H-3] JNJ-54232334 due to less non-specific binding. In summary, we describe [H-3] JNJ-54232334 as a novel P2X7 radioligand, with improved properties over [H-3] A-804598. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present study investigated how the exposure of tissue transglutaminase kept in a liquid phase and fixed to a solid support affected the binding of immunoglobulin (Ig)A and IgG autoantibodies in children with untreated and treated celiac disease. Methods: Included were 73 untreated celiac disease children, 50 controls and 80 children with treated celiac disease. IgA and IgG antitissue transglutaminase were measured with solid phase enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) and liquid phase radio-ligand binding assays. For IgG antitissue transglutaminase detection with radio-ligand binding assays antihuman IgG and protein A were used. IgA endomysial autoantibodies were measured by indirect immunofluorescence. Results: Both ELISA and radio-ligand binding assays detected IgA antitissue transglutaminase in 65 of 73 untreated celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. One additional control child was detected with radio-ligand binding assays. Endomysial autoantibodies were present in 62 of 73 celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. IgG antitissue transglutaminase was detected with both ELISA and radio-ligand binding assays in 40 of 73 untreated celiac disease children and in 2 of 50 controls. Radioligand binding assays using protein A detected 20 of 73 additional untreated celiac disease children and one control child with increased IgG antitissue transglutaminase. In treated celiac disease children, 21 of 80 were IgA antitissue transglutaminase positive with radioligand binding assays, 3 of 80 with ELISA, whereas none had endomysial autoantibodies. Conclusions: No qualitative differences between radioligand binding assays and ELISA in IgA or IgG antitissue transglutaminase binding from untreated celiac disease children was demonstrated. However, discrepancies in the binding of IgA antitissue transglutaminase from a subgroup of treated celiac disease children indicated that alterations of tissue transglutaminase might occur on fixation of the antigen. Protein A used for radioligand binding assays seemed not to assess IgG autoantibodies exclusively. IgA antitissue transglutaminase detection in screening of childhood celiac disease can be performed either by ELISA or radioligand binding assays because the two assays are interchangeable.

Estimation of the dissociation rate of unlabelled ligand-receptor complexes by a 'two-step' competition binding approach	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						radioligand binding; dissociation; kinetics; D-2 dopamine; CB1 cannabinoid; membrane partitioning; computer simulations	AT(1) RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ATYPICAL ANTIPSYCHOTICS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; TYPE-1 RECEPTOR; RESIDENCE TIME; ANTAGONIST; DRUG; MECHANISMS; DOPAMINE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Because the in vivo effectiveness of ligands may also be determined by the rate by which they dissociate from their target receptors, drug candidates are being increasingly screened for this kinetic property. The dissociation rate of unlabelled ligand-receptor complexes can be estimated indirectly from their ability to slow the association of subsequently added radioligand molecules. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We used the 'two-step competition' binding approach consisting of pre-incubating the receptor preparation with a wide range of ligand concentrations, washing off free ligand molecules, adding radioligand and monitoring its receptor binding after a fixed time. Based on the rationale that binding of both ligands is mutually exclusive and that they bind according to the law of mass action to a single class of sites, the unlabelled ligand's disociation rate can be estimated from the upward shift that the competition curve experiences after washing. KEY RESULTS The relevance of the 'two-step competition' approach was explored by computer simulations and by comparing the dissociation behaviour of unlabelled D-2 dopamine and CB1 cannabinoid receptor antagonists in this and alternative approaches. Besides providing satisfactory estimations of dissociation rates, the method also detects the ability of the unlabelled ligand molecules to be released from 'sinks' such as the cell membrane. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS As the 'two-step competition' requires rapid intermediate washing steps and needs radioligand binding to be measured at only one time point, this approach is particularly suited for binding studies on intact plated cells.

The study presented here describes the development and validation of a highly sensitive, rapid, and robust MS binding assay for the quantification of the binding of the metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGlu5) negative allosteric modulator (NAM), MPEP (2-methyl-6-phenylethynylpyridine) at the mGlu5 allosteric binding site. The LC-ESI-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometric) analytical method was established and validated with a deuterated analogue of MPEP as an internal standard. The developed MS binding assay described here allowed for the determination of MS binding affinity estimates that were in agreement with affinity estimates obtained from a tritiated MPEP radioligand saturation binding assay, indicating the suitability of this methodology for determining affinity estimates for compounds that target mGlu5 allosteric binding sites.

Binding density was highest in the amygdala (B-max = 149.9 +/- 13.8 fmol/mg protein), thalamic, and hypothalamic nuclei. A similar distribution was observed in mouse brain. We have confirmed the identity of these binding sites as the G-protein-coupled receptor, NPW1 (previously designated orphan receptor GPR7), using site-directed antisera that revealed receptors were expressed by neuronal cell bodies and processes, Additionally, we have demonstrated the presence of NPW-like immunoreactivity in neuronal cell bodies in areas projecting to the amygdala, such as the dorsal raphe nucleus and ventral tegmental area, providing evidence for an emerging new transmitter system.

In order to investigate the significance of dopamine and serotonin transporter and receptor gene polymorphisms on the expression of dopamine and serotonin transporters and the dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5HT(2A) receptors in brain tissue in PD, we conducted a study on brain autopsy material from 16 patients diagnosed with clinical PD and 11 controls. The polymorphisms studied were DAT1 VTNR, DRD2 Taq1A, 5HTTLPR, and 5HTR2A 102 T > C, 516 C > T, His425Tyr, and Thr25Asn. Compared to control subjects, patients with PD had a significantly lowered radioligand binding to the dopamine transporter (DAT) in nucleus caudatus (p = .001) and putamen (p = .008), and to the serotonin transporter in gyrus cingulatus (p = .010) and nucleus caudatus (p = .032). We did not observe any significant associations between genetic polymorphisms and the extent of radioligand binding or between the polymorphisms and a diagnosis of PD. In conclusion, the density of brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in patients with PD was reduced. However, there were no associations between the investigated genotypes and the expression of the corresponding receptors and transporters.

Recent reports have questioned the suitability of [H-3] adenine for adenine receptor binding studies because of curious results, e. g. high specific binding even in the absence of mammalian protein. In this study, we showed that specific [H-3] adenine binding to various mammalian membrane preparations increased linearly with protein concentration. Furthermore, we found that Tris-buffer solutions typically used for radioligand binding studies (50 mM, pH 7.4) that have not been freshly prepared but stored at 4 degrees C for some time may contain bacterial contaminations that exhibit high affinity binding for [H-3] adenine. Specific binding is abolished by heating the contaminated buffer or filtering it through 0.2-mu m filters. Three different, aerobic, gram-negative bacteria were isolated from a contaminated buffer solution and identified as Achromobacter xylosoxidans, A. denitrificans, and Acinetobacter lwoffii. A. xylosoxidans, a common bacterium that can cause nosocomial infections, showed a particularly high affinity for [H-3] adenine in the low nano-molar range. Structure-activity relationships revealed that hypoxanthine also bound with high affinity to A. xylosoxidans, whereas other nucleobases (uracil, xanthine) and nucleosides (adenosine, uridine) did not. The nature of the labeled site in bacteria is not known, but preliminary results indicate that it may be a high-affinity purine transporter. We conclude that [H-3] adenine is a well-suitable radioligand for adenine receptor binding studies but that bacterial contamination of the employed buffer solutions must be avoided.

Unexpected observations in positron emission tomography (PET) studies with [C-11]AZD9272, a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) radioligand with possible affinity for monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B), suggest that its binding is sensitive to anaesthesia with sevoflurane. The objective of the present study was to assess the effects of sevoflurane anaesthesia on the binding of [C-11]AZD9272 and of [C-11]L-deprenyl-D-2, a radioligand selective for MAO-B in non-human primates (NHPs). Methods: Altogether, 12 PET measurements were conducted with a high-resolution research tomograph using the ligands [C-11]AZD9272 or [C-11]L-deprenyl-D-2 in six cynomolgus monkeys anaesthetised with sevoflurane or ketamine/xylazine. Results: The specific binding of [C-11]AZD9272 and [C-11]L-deprenyl-D-2 was markedly reduced during anaesthesia with sevoflurane compared with ketamine/xylazine. The reduction was 80-90% (n=3) for [C-11]AZD9272 and 77-80% (n=3) for [C-11]L-deprenyl-D-2. Conclusions: Sevoflurane anaesthesia inhibited radioligand binding to MAO-B in the primate brain. The observation of lower MAO-B binding at clinically relevant concentrations of sevoflurane warrants further exploration of the potential role of MAO-B related mechanisms in regulation of systemic blood pressure during anaesthesia.

In this study, we developed 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide ([F-18]1) for PET imaging of colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), an emerging target for neuroinflammation imaging. Non-radioactive ligand 1 exhibited binding affinity comparable to that of a known CSF1R inhibitor, 5-cyano-N-(4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-(piperidin-1-yl)phenyl)furan-2-carboxamide (CPPC). Therefore, we synthesized radioligand [F-18]1 by radiofluorination of chlorine-substituted precursor 7 in 13-15% decay-corrected radiochemical yield. Dynamic PET/CT images showed higher uptake in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mouse brain than in control mouse brain. Ex vivo biodistribution study conducted at 45 min after radioligand injection showed that the brain uptake in LPS mice increased by 78% compared to that of control mice and was inhibited by 22% in LPS mice pretreated with CPPC, indicating specificity of [F-18]1 for CSF1R. A metabolism study demonstrated that the radioligand underwent little metabolism in the mouse brain. Taken together, these results suggest that [F-18]1 may hold promise as a radioligand for CSF1R imaging.

DTZ323 and diltiazem derivatives inhibited specific [H-3]DTZ323 binding with a rank order of DTZ323>DTZ417 (quaternary ammonium derivative of DTZ323)>diltiazem>L-cis-DTZ323. The affinity of DTZ323 was 51 times higher than that of diltiazem. [H-3]DTZ323 binding was also completely inhibited by verapamil and tetrandrine, thus revealing the unique nature of the diltiazem-binding site. Specific [H-3]DTZ323 binding to crude guinea pig ventricular membranes was inhibited by diltiazem, DTZ323 and its derivatives with IC50 values close to those previously reported for the blockade of L-type Ca2+ channel currents. These results indicate that [H-3]DTZ323 is a potent and selective radioligand for the diltiazem-binding site of L-type Ca2+ channels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

We recently developed the novel PET radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 that is highly selective for the 5-HT1B receptor. In this PET-study in three cynomolgus monkeys, we examined the sensitivity of [C-11]AZ10419369 to altered endogenous 5-HT levels. Fenfluramine-induced 5-HT release decreased radioligand binding in a dose-dependent fashion with a regional average of 27% after 1 mg/kg and 50% after 5 mg/kg. This preliminary study supports that [C-11]AZ10419369 is sensitive to endogenous 5-HT levels in vivo and may serve as a tool to examine the pathophysiology and treatment of major psychiatric disorders.

The increasing use of functional assays has shown that allosteric ligands are capable of modulating both orthosteric agonist affinity and efficacy, as well as mediating receptor activation in their own right. Such a complex range of behaviours can be difficult to discern from single datasets; this chapter seeks to explain how to use radioligand binding and functional assay datasets in concert to elucidate allosteric modulator mechanism of action.

To improve the signal to noise ratio we have developed the radioligand [C-11]AZD2184 and report here the first clinical evaluation. Eight AD patients and four younger control subjects underwent 93-min PET measurements with [C-11]AZD2184. A ratio approach using the cerebellum as reference region was applied to determine binding parameters. Brain uptake of [C-11]AZD2184 peaked within 1 min at 3-4% of injected radioactivity. AD patients had high radioactivity in cortical regions while controls had uniformly low radioactivity uptake. Specific binding peaked within 30 min at which time standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) ranged between 1.19 and 2.57. [C-11]AZD2184 is a promising radioligand for detailed mapping of A beta amyloid depositions in Alzheimer's disease, due to low non-specific binding, high signal to background ratio and reversible binding as evident from early peak equilibrium.

It has been hypothesized that autoimmune abnormalities underlie the etiology of narcolepsy, based on the tight association with HLA-DR131*1501/DQ1311*0602. It remains unclear if autoantibodies against hypocretin receptors (hcrtr1 and hcrtr2) are involved in narcolepsy. Design: We have developed a novel radioligand binding assay to address this question. Sera from 181 patients with narcolepsy, 10 patients with other hypersomnias, and 91 control subjects were used. Human [S-35]-Hcrt, hcrtr1, and hcrtr2 were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation system. The immune complex of autoantibody and each [S-35]-protein were immunoprecipitated and quantified using a radioligand-binding assay. Results: We detected autoantibodies against hypocretin in 3 patients, hcrtr1 in 1 patient, and hcrtr2 in 5 patients with narcolepsy. Positive reactions were also found against hcrtr1 in 2 and hcrtr2 in I control subjects. No relationships were found between these autoantibodies and HLADRB1*1501/DQB1*0602 haplotypes, presence of cataplexy, presence of subjective nocturnal sleep disruption, or the score on the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Conclusions: Although we have detected autoantibodies against the hypocretin neurotransmission system, our results do not support the hypothesis that autoantibody-mediated dysfunction in the hypocretin system underlies the pathophysiology of narcolepsy.

However, no 5-HT6 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer is currently used in clinical imaging studies. The purpose of this study was to propose the first fluorinated PET radiotracer for this brain receptor. Methods: A new compound presenting in vitro high affinity towards the serotoninergic 5-HT6 receptor, N-[2-(1-L(4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl]-1H-indol-4-yloxy)ethyl]-N,N-dimethylamine, was labelled with fluorine 18 via a nitro-/fluoronucleophilic substitution. Biological evaluations included (i) in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographies in rat brain and (ii) a PET scan on anaesthetized cat. Results and Conclusion: Although the radioligand showed excellent brain penetration, it did not reveal any specific binding to the 5-HT6 receptors indicating that this radiotracer is not suitable for mapping 5-HT6 receptors using PET.

Serotonin 2A receptor agonist binding in the human brain with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Cimbi-36	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						agonist; clinical; kinetic modeling; positron emission tomography; 5-HT2A receptor	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; 5-HT2A RECEPTORS; PET RADIOLIGAND; RELEASE; REPRODUCIBILITY; QUANTIFICATION; RADIOTRACER; PARAMETERS; CHALLENGE	[C-11]Cimbi-36 was recently developed as a selective serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonist radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging. Such an agonist PET radioligand may provide a novel, and more functional, measure of the serotonergic system and agonist binding is more likely than antagonist binding to reflect 5-HT levels in vivo. Here, we show data from a first-in-human clinical trial with [C-11]Cimbi-36. In 29 healthy volunteers, we found high brain uptake and distribution according to 5-HT2A receptors with [C-11]Cimbi-36 PET. The two-tissue compartment model using arterial input measurements provided the most optimal quantification of cerebral [C-11]Cimbi-36 binding. Reference tissue modeling was feasible as it induced a negative but predictable bias in [C-11]Cimbi-36 PET outcome measures. In five subjects, pretreatment with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin before a second PET scan significantly decreased [C-11]Cimbi-36 binding in all cortical regions with no effects in cerebellum. These results confirm that [C-11]Cimbi-36 binding is selective for 5-HT2A receptors in the cerebral cortex and that cerebellum is an appropriate reference tissue for quantification of 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain. Thus, we here describe [C-11]Cimbi-36 as the first agonist PET radioligand to successfully image and quantify 5-HT2A receptors in the human brain.

In the present study a methylated analogue, 5-methyl-6-nitroquipazine (MNQP), was radiolabeled with carbon-11 in a two step reaction via a palladium catalyzed cross coupling reaction between N-t-BOC-protected 5-tributylstannyl-6-nitroquipazine and [C-11]methyl iodide as key step. [C-11]MNQP was examined in the cynomolgus monkey brain with positron emission tomography (PET) and the appearance of labeled metabolites in monkey plasma was measured with gradient HPLC. Radioactivity increased continuously in all brain regions during the 90 minutes acquisition time. Highest accumulation of radioactivity was observed in the thalamus and brainstem, regions with a known high density of 5-HTT. The calculated ratios between the thalamus and brainstem to the 5-HTT poor cerebellum were 1.5 and 1.3-1.4, respectively, 80 minutes after radioligand injection. Pretreatment with citalopram prior to the PET measurement markedly reduced the binding in the thalamus and the brainstem. At 15 and 30 minutes after injection of [C-11]MNQP approximately 90% and 60%, respectively, of radioactivity in plasma represented unchanged radioligand. The slow kinetics and moderate ratios recorded however, may limit its use as a PET radioligand for quantitative studies of the serotonin transporter with PET. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Within the alpha v integrins, the epithelially restricted alpha v beta 6 has been identified as playing a key role in the activation of transforming growth factor that is hypothesized to be pivotal in the development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). As part of a drug discovery program to identify a selective alpha v beta 6 RGD mimetic for IPF, cell adhesion and radioligand binding assays were investigated to screen compounds to determine affinity and v integrin selectivity. In this study, a pan-alpha v radioligand was characterized against all the v integrins and used to determine accurate selectivity profiles for literature and novel RGD ligands, as well as enable an early readout on alpha v beta 6 dissociation kinetics. It has been shown that while cell adhesion offers a high throughput and reliable format for ranking compounds, there are downsides to this format when comparing selectivity across v integrins. By accurately defining the relationship between these assay formats, a medicinal chemistry effort has identified novel, high-affinity, and selective alpha v beta 6 RGD mimetics with slow dissociation kinetics, with the potential to be developed into clinical candidates for IPF.

However, a recent study showed that CUMI-101 behaved as a potent 5-HT(1)A receptor antagonist in rat brain. CUMI-101 also has moderate affinity (Ki = 6.75 nM) for alpha(1) adrenoceptors measured in vitro. The current study examined the functional properties and selectivity of CUMI-101, both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The functional assay was performed using S-35-GTP gamma S (GTP is guanosine triphosphate) in primate brains. The cross-reactivity of CUMI-101 with alpha(1) adrenoceptors was performed using in vitro radioligand binding studies in rat, monkey, and human brains as well as in vivo PET imaging in mouse, rat, and monkey brains. Results: CUMI-101 did not stimulate S-35-GTP gamma S binding in primate brain, in contrast to 8-OH-DPAT, a potent 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Instead, CUMI-101 behaved as a potent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist by dose-dependently inhibiting 8-OH-DPAT-stimulated S-35-GTP gamma S binding. Both in vitro and in vivo studies showed that CUMI-101 had significant a1 adrenoceptor cross-reactivity. On average, across all 3 species examined, cross-reactivity was highest in the thalamus (>45%) and lowest in the neocortex and cerebellum (<10%). PET imaging further confirmed that only preblocking with WAY-100635 plus prazosin decreased C-11-CUMI-101 brain uptake to that of self-block. Conclusion: CUMI-101 behaves as a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist in primate brain, with significant, regional-dependent alpha(1) adrenoceptor cross-reactivity, limiting its potential use as a PET radioligand in humans.

In this study, we report the synthesis of the new H3R radioligand [H-3]UR-MN259 ([H-3]<bold>11</bold>) with high (radio)chemical purity and stability. The radioligand exhibits sub-nanomolar affinity for the target receptor (pK(i) (H3R) = 9.56) and displays an outstanding selectivity profile within the histamine receptor family (>100,000-fold selective). [H-3]UR-MN259 is ideally suitable for the characterization of H3R ligands in competition binding and shows one-site binding to the H3R in saturation binding experiments. The radiotracer shows fast association to the receptor (tau(assoc) = 6.11 min), as well as full dissociation from the receptor (tau(dissoc) = 14.48 min) in kinetic binding studies. The distinguished profile of [H-3]UR-MN259 makes it a highly promising pharmacological tool to further investigate the role of the H3R in the CNS.

A two-state model for the kinetics of competitive radioligand binding	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ADENOSINE A(1) RECEPTOR; TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; CONCISE GUIDE; LEAD OPTIMIZATION; DISSOCIATION RATE; DRUG; LIGAND; ANTAGONISTS; AGONISTS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Ligand-receptor binding kinetics is receiving increasing attention in the drug research community. The Motulsky and Mahan model, a one-state model, offers a method for measuring the binding kinetics of an unlabelled ligand, with the assumption that the labelled ligand has no preference while binding to distinct states or conformations of a drug target. As such, the one-state model is not applicable if the radioligand displays biphasic binding kinetics to the receptor. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We extended the Motulsky and Mahan model to a two-state model, in which the kinetics of the unlabelled competitor binding to different receptor states (R-1 and R-2) can be measured. With this extended model, we determined the binding kinetics of unlabelled N-5-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), a representative agonist for the adenosine A(1) receptor. Subsequently, an application of the model was exemplified by measuring the binding kinetics of other A(1) receptor ligands. In addition, limitations of the model were investigated as well. KEY RESULTS The kinetic rate constants of unlabelled NECA were comparable with the results of kinetic radioligand binding assays in which [H-3]-NECA was used. The model was further validated by good correlation between simulated results and the experimental data. CONCLUSION The two-state model is sufficient to analyse the binding kinetics of an unlabelled ligand, when a radioligand shows biphasic association characteristics. We expect this two-state model to have general applicability for other targets as well.

Two of these mutants, C107A and C184A, showed no agonist-dependent activation in a cell-based reporter assay for mEP3 gamma, whereas none of the other cysteine-to-alanine mutations disrupted mEP3 gamma signal transduction. Total cell membranes prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with mEP3 gamma C107A or C184A had no detectable radioligand binding. Other mutant mEP3 gamma receptors had radioligand affinities and receptor densities similar to wildtype. Cell-surface ELISA against the N-terminal HA-tag of C107A and C184A demonstrated 40% and 47% reductions respectively in receptor protein expression at the cell surface, and no radioligand binding was detected as assessed by intact cell radioligand binding experiments. These data suggest a key role for C107 and C184 in both receptor structure/stability and function and is consistent with the presence of a conserved disulfide bond between C107 and C184 in mouse EP3 that is required for normal receptor expression and function. Our results also indicate that if a second disulfide bond is present in the native receptor it is non-essential for receptor assembly or function. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of a PET Radioligand to Image <i>O</i>-GlcNAcase in Brain and Periphery of Rhesus Monkey and Knock-Out Mouse	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; O-GlcNAcase; tau; Alzheimer disease	TAU; PHOSPHORYLATION; GLCNACYLATION	Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, a microtubule-associated protein, plays an important role in the progression of Alzheimer disease. Animal studies suggest that one strategy for treating Alzheimer disease and related tauopathies may be inhibition of O-GlcNAcase (OGA), which may subsequently decrease pathologic tau phosphorylation. Here, we report the pharmacokinetics of a novel PET radioligand, F-18-LSN3316612, which binds with high affinity and selectivity to OGA. Methods: PET imaging was performed on rhesus monkeys at baseline and after administration of either thiamet-G, a potent OGA inhibitor, or nonradioactive LSN3316612. The density of the enzyme was calculated as distribution volume using a 2-tissue-compartment model and serial concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. The radiation burden for future studies was based on whole-body imaging of monkeys. Oga(Delta Br), a mouse brain-specific knockout of Oga, was also scanned to assess the specificity of the radioligand for its target enzyme. Results: Uptake of radioactivity in monkey brain was high (similar to 5 SUV) and followed by slow washout. The highest uptake was in the amygdala, followed by striatum and hippocampus. Pretreatment with thiamet-G or nonradioactive LSN3316612 reduced brain uptake to a low and uniformconcentration in all regions, corresponding to an approximately 90% decrease in distribution volume. Whole-body imaging of rhesus monkeys showed high uptake in kidney, spleen, liver, and testes. In Oga(Delta Br) mice, brain uptake of F-18-LSN3316612 was reduced by 82% compared with control mice. Peripheral organs were unaffected in Oga(Delta Br) mice, consistent with loss of OGA expression exclusively in the brain. The effective dose of F-18-LSN3316612 in humans was calculated to be 22 mu Sv/MBq, which is typical for F-18-labeled radioligands. Conclusion: These results show that F-18-LSN3316612 is an excellent radioligand for imaging and quantifying OGA in rhesus monkeys and mice. On the basis of these data, F-18-LSN3316612 merits evaluation in humans.

As peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) may represent a tool for peripheral detection of neuroreceptors, we compared the expression of dopamine D3 (DRD3) and D4 (DRD4) receptors on PBL in migraine patients and in healthy controls using radioligand binding assay techniques in the presence of antidopamine D2-like receptor antibodies. The dopamine D2-like receptor agonist [H-3]7-OH-DPAT was used as a radioligand. An increased density of both DRD3 (P=0.0006) and DRD4 (P=0.002) on PBL was observed in migraineurs compared with controls. This up-regulation might reflect central and/or peripheral dopamine receptor hypersensitivity due to hypofunction of the dopaminergic system. These findings support the view that dopamine D2-like receptors are involved in the determination of the so-called migraine trait, which may help to elucidate several clinical features of the disease.

It is considered as a pluripotent drug target in several pathologies. The publication of agonist and antagonist bound receptor structures has paved the way for receptor-based in silico drug design. However, recent studies on this subject payed no attention to the structural differences of agonist and antagonist binding. In this work, we have developed a new ensemble docking-based virtual screening protocol utilizing both agonist and antagonist bound S1R structures. This protocol was used to screen our in-house compound library. The S1R binding affinities of the 40 highest ranked compounds were measured in competitive radioligand binding assays and the sigma-2 receptor (S2R) affinities of the best S1R binders were also determined. This way three novel high affinity S1R ligands were identified and one of them exhibited a notable S1R/S2R selectivity.

We retrospectively screened our patient database for TLS after RLT in neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer. Methods: The database was searched for patients receiving RLT with Lu-177-DOTATATE, -DOTA-TOC, or -prostate-specific membrane antigen and showing laboratory or clinical abnormalities typical of TLS within 7 d after the start of treatment. Results: In total, 205 patients (539 cycles) were screened; 4 patients developed TLS with clinical symptoms and characteristic changes in laboratory parameters, which normalized after appropriate treatment. Follow-up revealed partial remission in 2 patients, a mixed response in one, and progressive disease in one. Conclusion: Clinical TLS is a rare but definite complication of RLT, suggesting that patient monitoring for TLS should be mandatory.

The resulting rates of internalization of murine receptors were then compared with those of sheep GnRH-R in ovine gonadotrophs. Cells were incubated with radioiodinated [D-Ala(6)]GnRH on ice for 4 h to allow binding of the ligand to GnRH-R, then cells were warmed to 37 degreesC to permit internalization. Surface-bound radioligand began to decrease as soon as the cells were warmed and had decreased significantly within 20 min. A steady-state level of surface-bound radioligand was achieved after 60 min in both CHO cells and L beta T2 cells (38% and 41%, respectively of initial value; P < 0.05). Internalization of radioligand began immediately after warming the cells to 37<degrees>C, and a significant proportion of surface ligand had been internalized by 20 min. A steady-state maximum of internalization was reached after 60 min in both CHO cells and L beta T2 cells (29% and 28%, respectively, of total cell-associated ligand; P < 0.05). Changes in surface-bound radioligand and internalized radioligand in sheep pituitary cells were similar to those in CHO cells and L<beta>T2 cells, but the amount of radioligand internalized after 60 min (40% of total cell-associated ligand) was 1.4 times higher than in CHO cells and L beta T2 cells (P < 0.05). In a separate experiment, the effect of estradiol on the rate of internalization of GnRH-R in ovine pituitary cells was examined. Although treatment of ovine pituitary cells with estradiol approximately doubled the number of GnRH receptors, it did not alter either the rate or extent of receptor internalization. These results show that rates of internalization of recombinant murine GnRH-R-GFP in CHO cells and native murine and ovine GnRH-R in L<beta>T2 cells and in sheep pituitary cells, respectively, are similar, but amounts of ovine GnRH-R internalized are greater than those for murine GnRH-R. Further,the rate of internalization of occupied receptor is similar in gonadotroph and nongonadotroph cells, and the addition of GFP to the C-terminus of the murine GnRH-R does not alter the rate of internalization.

Metabolism studies of [F-18]1 showed no metabolites in the mouse brain. Tissue distribution studies demonstrated its uniform regional distribution in the mouse brain, suggesting that this radioligand is not suitable for the in vivo imaging of AChE. This result along with reports on radiolabeled AT-benzylpiperidine lactam benzisoxazole (IC50 < 1 nM) and other radiolabeled benzylpiperidme derivatives (IC50 > 1 nM) suggested that a subnanornolar IC50 may not be the only important factor in determining the suitability of a radioligand for in Vivo Studies of AChE.

J	Reavill, C; Boyfield, I; Coldwell, M; Nelson, P				Reavill, C; Boyfield, I; Coldwell, M; Nelson, P			Comparative pharmacological study of ropinirole (SKF-101468) and its metabolites in rats	JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							EARLY PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; DOPAMINE-D2 AGONIST; HUMAN D-2(LONG); HUMAN FOREBRAIN; RECEPTORS; D-3; D3; 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE; BROMOCRIPTINE	The dopamine receptor agonist ropinirole (SKF-101468) is used to treat Parkinson's disease. Ropinirole is metabolized by two routes to a series of different metabolites although the predominant pathway is species-dependent. It is unknown whether any of the metabolites contribute to its antiparkinsonian activity and whether D-3 or D-2 receptor agonist activity plays a preferential role. Therefore ropinirole and its primary metabolites, SKF-104557, SKF-97930 and SKF-96990, and the rat metabolite, SKF-89124 were tested in the 6-hydroxydopamine lesion model of Parkinson's disease. SKF-89124 and SKF-96990 were also assayed in radioligand binding and microphysiometer functional assays at cloned human dopamine D-2 and D-3. Ropinirole and SKF-89124 were equipotent in-vivo, and produced dose-related increases in circling at 0.05-0.8 mg kg(-1), s.c. (ropinirole) and 0.05-0.75 mg kg(-1), s.c. (SKF-89124). Neither SKF-96990 or SKF-97930, at doses up to 15 mg kg-l, increased the circling rate. Some circling was observed with 15 mg kg-l SKF-104557 but the response was less than half that produced by ropinirole (0.8 mg kg(-1)). SKF-104557 was 150-fold less potent than ropinirole. SKF-89124 possessed-30-fold higher affinity for D-3 over D-2 receptors in radioligand binding studies, but was not selective in the functional microphysiometer assay. SKF-96990 was 10-fold selective for D-3 over D-2 receptors in the radioligand binding assay. Ropinirole and SKF-104557 are 20-fold selective for D-3 over D-2 receptors in radioligand binding assays whereas in microphysiometry, selectivity is 10-fold. SKF-97930 is inactive in radioligand binding and microphysiometer assays. Primary metabolites of ropinirole did not contribute significantly to its activity in this model of Parkinson's disease. The lack of dopamine D-3/D-2 receptor selectivity for ropinirole rules out the possibility of attributing the degree of either D-2 or D-3 receptor activity to the behavioural efficacy of ropinirole.

Synthesis and characterization in monkey of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]SP203 as a radioligand for imaging brain metabotropic glutamate 5 receptors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Radioligand; PET; mGluR5; Carbon-11; SP203	SUBTYPE-5 RECEPTORS; PET; ANTAGONIST; COCAINE; POTENT	[F-18]SP203 (3-fluoro-5-(2-(2-([F-18]fluoromethyl)-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzonitrile) is an effective high-affinity and selective radioligand for imaging metabotropic 5 receptors (mGluR5) in human brain with PET. To provide a radioligand that may be used for more than one scanning session in the same subject in a single day, we set out to label SP203 with shorter-lived C-11 (t (1/2) = 20.4 min) and to characterize its behavior as a radioligand with PET in the monkey. Iodo and bromo precursors were obtained by cross-coupling 2-fluoromethyl-4-((trimethylsilyl)ethynyl)-1,3-thiazole with 3,5-diiodofluorobenzene and 3,5-dibromofluorobenzene, respectively. Treatment of either precursor with [C-11]cyanide ion rapidly gave [C-11]SP203, which was purified with high-performance liquid chromatography. PET was used to measure the uptake of radioactivity in brain regions after injecting [C-11]SP203 intravenously into rhesus monkeys at baseline and under conditions in which mGluR5 were blocked with 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP). The emergence of radiometabolites in monkey blood in vitro and in vivo was assessed with radio-HPLC. The stability of [C-11]SP203 in human blood in vitro was also measured. The iodo precursor gave [C-11]SP203 in higher radiochemical yield (> 98 %) than the bromo precursor (20-52 %). After intravenous administration of [C-11]SP203 into three rhesus monkeys, radioactivity peaked early in brain (average 12.5 min) with a regional distribution in rank order of expected mGluR5 density. Peak uptake was followed by a steady decline. No radioactivity accumulated in the skull. In monkeys pretreated with MTEP before [C-11]SP203 administration, radioactivity uptake in brain was again high but then declined more rapidly than in the baseline scan to a common low level. [C-11]SP203 was unstable in monkey blood in vitro and in vivo, and gave predominantly less lipophilic radiometabolites. By contrast, [C-11]SP203 was stable in human blood in vitro. [C-11]SP203 emulates [F-18]SP203 with regard to providing a sizeable mGluR5-specific signal in monkey brain, and advantageously avoids troublesome accumulation of radioactivity in bone. Although [C-11]SP203 is unsuitable for mGluR5 quantification in monkey brain, its evaluation as a PET radioligand for studying human brain mGluR5 is nevertheless warranted.

Compound 9 was labeled with fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.7 min) in high specific activity by treating the prepared nitro analogue (12) with cyclotron-produced [F-18]-fluoride ion. [F-18]9 was studied with PET in mouse and in monkey after intravenous injection. [F-18]9 showed favorable properties as a candidate PET radioligand, including moderately high brain uptake with a high proportion of H-3 receptor-specific signal in the absence of radiodefluorination. The nitro compound 12 was found to have even higher H-3 receptor affinity, indicating the potential of this chemotype for the development of further promising PET ralioligands.

The in vivo biodistribution of this radioligand in rats showed high brain uptake and a distribution consistent with the density of dopamine D1 receptors. Highest uptake was observed in the striatum (0.65 %ID/g) at 5 min followed by clearance, As a measure of specificity the striatum/cerebellar ratio reached a maximum of 3.9 at 30 min post-injection. Radioactivity in the striatum was reduced by 68% by pre-administration of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390. Pre-administration of other dopamine binding drugs, spiperone (D2), 7-OH-DPAT (D3), and clozapine (D4) displayed no inhibitory effect on (+)2-[I-123]A-69024 accumulation in any brain region. Ketanserin (5-HT2/5-HT2C) and haloperidol (D2 receptor antagonist/sigma receptor ligand) also displayed no inhibitory effect in any brain region studied. With the pharmacologically inactive enantiomer, (-)-2-[I-123]A-69024. the brain uptake was determined to be non-specific since a striatum/cerebellar ratio of near 1 was observed throughout the time course of the experiment. (+)-2-[I-123]A-69024 displays enantioselectivity for dopamine D1 receptors and may deserve further investigation as a possible SPECT radioligand, (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In the presence of anandamide, [H-3]N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) inhibition binding was characterized by Hill coefficients greater than I while saturation binding isotherms were characterized by a reduction in radioligand B-max. Anandamide did not affect the potency of classic agonists, antagonists or allosteric modulators to inhibit [H-3]NMS binding, indicating that the site of anandamide action did not involve receptor regions recognized by these compounds. Although the mode of binding of anandamide was reversible, the order of ligand addition was important; the inhibitory effect was greatest when anandamide was equilibrated with the receptor prior to radioligand addition, and weakest in the converse situation. Interestingly, the inhibitory potency of anandamide was reduced on pre-equilibration with non-transfected CHO cell membranes, prior to addition of M-1 mAChR-transfected membranes. In phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis assays, anandamide significantly reduced the maximal response to acetylcholine, but at higher concentrations than those needed to fully inhibit radioligand binding. Studies utilizing a range of agonists with varying intrinsic activities showed that the inhibitory effects of anandamide on agonist function were most pronounced with the lowest efficacy agonists. These findings suggest that the mechanism of action of anandamide at the M-1 mAChR involves perturbation of the receptor via the membrane in a manner that is sensitive to the conformation of the receptor (occupied versus vacant).

J	Doran, AC; Wan,YP; Kopin, AS; Beinborn, M				Doran, AC; Wan,YP; Kopin, AS; Beinborn, M			Established theory of radiation-induced decay is not generalizable to Bolton-Hunter labeled peptides	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						radioligand; glucagon-like peptide; cholecystokinin; receptor; radioactive decay; peptide hormone	RECEPTOR; RADIOIMMUNOASSAY; CLONING	Peptide hormones radiolabeled with I-125 are widely used for the pharmacological characterization of cognate receptors. As a prerequisite for calculating ligand affinities from competition binding assays, and for estimating receptor densities from such studies, it is necessary to know the concentration of bioactive radioligand that is used in respective experiments. It has been demonstrated previously that radioiodinated peptides undergo decay catastrophe, i.e. disintegration of the radioactive label leads to the concomitant destruction of the carrier peptide. Here, we demonstrate that decay catastrophe does not apply to two peptide hormones that are iodinated by Bolton-Hunter conjugation: cholecystokinin octapeptide and glucagon-like peptide 2. The function of aged samples of these radioligands at corresponding recombinantly expressed receptors was assessed by measuring ligand-induced inositol phosphate production or generation of cyclic AMP, respectively. Both of the tested compounds, although predicted by decay catastrophe to contain little or subthreshold remaining bioactivity, stimulated an unexpectedly high level of receptor-mediated second messenger signaling. Quantitative comparison of observed functions with those of corresponding unlabeled peptides suggested that the bioactivity of each radioligand had been largely conserved despite the radioactive decay of the iodine label. Consistent with an apparent absence of decay catastrophe, we noted that the specific radioactivity, when determined immediately following peptide iodination, was close to the theoretical maximum but exponentially decreased over time. These findings raise the possibility that attachment of a Bolton-Hunter conjugate may shield labeled peptides from radiation-induced damage, a scenario that should be considered when performing radioligand binding experiments.

An Empirical Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Equation Assists the Discovery of High-Affinity Phosphodiesterase 4D Inhibitors as Leads to PET Radioligands	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; SELECTIVE PDE4B; DESIGN; BRAIN; ROLIPRAM; DISEASE; OPTIMIZATION; DERIVATIVES; ALIGNMENT	A positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) would benefit drug discovery and the investigation of neuropsychiatric disorders. The most promising radioligand to date, namely, [11C]T1650, has shown unstable quantification in humans. Structural elaboration of [11C]T1650 was therefore deemed necessary. High target affinity in the low nM range is usually required for successful PET radioligands. In our PDE4D PET radioligand development, we formulated and optimized an empirical equation (log[IC50 (nM)] = P1 + P2 + P3 + P4) that well described the relationship between binding affinity and empirically derived values (P1-P4) for the individual fragments in four subregions commonly composing each inhibitor (R2 = 0.988, n = 62). This equation was used to predict compounds that would have high inhibitory potency. Fourteen new compounds were obtained with IC50 of 0.3-10 nM. Finally, eight compounds were judged to be worthy of future radiolabeling and evaluation as PDE4D PET radioligands.

The 5-HT1A family is the best characterized subtype of the fourteen currently known 5-HT receptors. The 5-HT1A receptor is closely involved in the pathogenesis of anxiety, depression, epilepsy and eating disorders and therefore is an important target for drug therapy. The development in the 1980s of molecules specifically targeting this receptor was followed by the rapid development of corresponding PET neuroimaging. Because this receptor represents a crucial target in neuroscience, a large number of radioligands have been developed by academic and industry centers for visualization and quantification, first in living animals and ultimately in humans. After a brief account of some of the structural and functional characteristics of brain 5-HT1A receptors, this review focuses on the main lines of evolution opened up by preclinical and clinical 5-HT1A PET radiopharmaceuticals, illustrating the potential value of PET for clinical research and drug development.

MADAM was radiolabeled by an N-methylation reaction using [C-11]methyl triflate and the binding was characterized by PET in four cynomolgus monkeys. Metabolite levels in plasma were measured by gradient high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC. The radiochemical incorporation yield of [C-11]MADAM was 75-80% and the specific radioactivity at the time of administration was 34-652 GBq/mu mol (n = 8). The highest uptake of radioactivity was observed in striatum, thalamus, mesencephalon, and the lower brainstem. Lower binding was detected in neocortex and the lowest radioactive uptake was found in the cerebellum. This distribution is in accordance with the known expression of 5-HTT in vitro. The fraction of the total radioactivity in monkey plasma representing unchanged [C-11]MADAM was 20% at 45 min after injection, as measured by gradient HPLC. Pretreatment measurements, using unlabeled citalopram, GBR 12909, and maprotiline, as well as a displacement measurement, using unlabeled MADAM, confirmed that [C-11]MADAM binds selectively and reversibly to 5-HTT, and support the use of the cerebellum as reference region. The present characterization of binding in the monkey brain suggests that [C-11]MADAM is a potential PET radioligand for quantitative studies of 5-HTT binding in the human brain.

However, owing to their short retention times and predominant targeting of stro-mal cells rather than cancer cells, they are difficult to use as therapeutic probes.

How-ever, there are still many challenges in the preclin-ical evaluation of therapeutic FAPI to realize clinical translation with sufficient therapeutic ef-fects in patients.

The allosteric ternary complex model (ATCM) is the simplest model applied to derive estimates of modulator affinity (K-B) and cooperativity (alpha), which are necessary for understanding structure-activity relationships. However, the increasing drive toward assay miniaturization in modern drug discovery may lead to conditions where appreciable ligand depletion occurs in the assay. Theoretical simulations investigating the impact of orthosteric radioligand depletion on the estimation of ATCM parameters revealed the following. 1) For allosteric inhibitors, application of the standard ATCM to data obtained under depletion conditions leads to an underestimation of pK(B) and an overestimation of log alpha. 2) For allosteric enhancers, the opposite was noted, but not always; the nonlinear regression algorithm is more likely to struggle to converge to a satisfactory solution of (nondepletion) ATCM parameters in this situation. 3) Application of a novel ATCM that explicitly incorporates orthosteric ligand depletion will yield more reliable model estimates, provided the degree of depletion is not high (< similar to 50%). Subsequent experiments investigated the interaction between [H-3]N-methylscopolamine and the allosteric enhancer, alcuronium, or inhibitor, gallamine, in the presence of increasing concentrations of M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor and showed that application of an ATCM that explicitly incorporates radioligand depletion can indeed give more robust estimates of modulator affinity and cooperativity estimates than the standard model. These results have important implications for the quantification of allosteric modulator actions in binding-based discovery assays.

An Agonist Radioligand for the Proinflammatory Lipid-Activated G Protein-Coupled Receptor GPR84 Providing Structural Insights	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							FATTY-ACIDS; LIGANDS; IDENTIFICATION; LYMPHOCYTES; ANTAGONISTS; INHIBITION; DISCOVERY; TOOL	The orphan G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) GPR84 is expressed on immune cells mediating proinflammatory and immunostimulatory effects. In this study, we prepared the fully efficacious, nonbiased GPR84 agonist 6-hexylamino-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione (6) in tritium-labeled form ([H-3]PSB-1584) by hydrogenation of a hexenyl-substituted precursor with tritium gas. The radio-ligand was characterized by kinetic, saturation, and competition assays using membranes of Chinese hamster ovary cells recombinantly expressing the human GPR84. [H-3]6 reversibly labeled the receptor with high affinity (K-D 2.08 nM). Structurally diverse orthosteric and allosteric ligands, including newly designed and synthesized compounds, were studied in competition binding assays. A homology model of GPR84 was generated to perform docking studies rationalizing the experimental data. The radioligand was additionally used for labeling GPR84 in native cells and tissues. [H-3]6 constitutes the first GPR84 agonist radioligand representing a powerful tool for this poorly investigated GPCR, which has potential as a future drug target.

METHODS: The m(3) receptor selective peptide segments deduced from its gene were chemically synthesized, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin carrier protein, and injected to Balb/c mice to raise monoclonal antibody. Antibody was purified by a combination of two-step precipitation methods and ion-exchange chromatography. The specificity of monoclonal antibody was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and radioligand binding assay of receptors. RESULTS: The:monoclonal antibody specifically bound to the protein of rat salivary gland and m(3) peptide, but not m(4) peptide. In radioligand binding assay of receptors, monoclonal antibody inhibited the binding of H-3-QNB to muscarinic receptor in rat salivary gland, but not in rat heart, and could not inhibit the binding of H-3-PZ to rat brain cerebral cortex membrane protein. Immunohistochemical study showed that the human salivary cell surface was strongly stained, whereas the human heart cell surface was not. CONCLUSION: Highly purified (96.3 %) monoclonal antibody against the m(3) receptor peptide recognized the m(3) receptor.

Here, we use the radiolabelled compound to further characterise its binding properties at 5-HT1A receptors. F13640 was tritium-labelled to 47 and 64 Ci/mmol specific activity and used as radioligand at membrane preparations of CHO cells expressing human (h) 5-HT1A receptors. The K (d) of [H-3]-F13640 was 1.8 nM at h5-HT1A receptors as determined from saturation binding experiments. In association time-course experiments, k (obs) of [H-3]-F13640 was 0.06 min(-1). Dissociation experiments performed in the presence of unlabelled F13640 as competing ligand yielded a k (off) value of 0.05 min(-1), resulting in a calculated K (d) of 1.4 nM. In comparison, [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT had a k (obs) of 0.50 min(-1), a k (off) of 0.25 min(-1) and a calculated K (d) of 0.37 nM. Surprisingly, [H-3]-F13640 dissociation kinetics were distinctly slower in the presence of WAY-100635 and spiperone as competing ligands when compared with the agonist competitors, F13640 and (+)8-OH-DPAT. The competitive binding profile of [H-3]-F13640 with eight chemically diverse 5-HT1A receptor agonists and antagonists correlated highly (r = 0.996) with that of [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT. In conclusion, [H-3]-F13640 is a potent agonist radioligand at 5-HT1A receptors and may be a useful tool in pharmacological studies at native and recombinant 5-HT1A receptors. In addition, [H-3]-F13640 dissociates more slowly from h5-HT1A receptors than [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT, a kinetic property that might be related to its powerful analgesic effects as observed in vivo.

Commonly, parametric models are fit to metabolism data and then the fitted model is used to correct the plasma input function. C-11-WAY 100635 is a rapidly metabolized radioligand used extensively in mapping the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A system. Methods: To evaluate the adequacy of fit of 4 metabolite models, we examined data from 92 subjects who received an injection of C-11-WAY 100635, were imaged with PET, and underwent measurement of total plasma concentration and metabolites. The performance of these models was assessed according to residual plots, as well as fit and information criteria. Results: The study showed that the choice of model has a substantial effect on the resulting estimates of outcome measures. Conclusion: Among the models considered, the Hill model provides the best fit across all criteria.

PSMA-targeted alpha therapy is of growing interest due to the high-emission energy and short range of alpha particles, resulting in a prominent cytotoxic potency. This study assesses the influence of various factors on the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic efficacy of the alpha particle generating PSMA-targeting radioligand Pb-212-NG001. This study aimed to determine the influence of cellular PSMA expression, radioligand binding and internalization, and repeated administrations on the therapeutic effects of the PSMA-targeting radioligand Pb-212-NG001. Cellular binding and internalization, cytotoxicity, biodistribution, and the therapeutic efficacy of Pb-212-NG001 were investigated in two human prostate cancer cell lines with different PSMA levels: C4-2 (PSMA+) and PC-3 PIP (PSMA+++). Despite 10-fold higher PSMA expression on PC-3 PIP cells, cytotoxicity and therapeutic efficacy of the radioligand was only 1.8-fold better than for the C4-2 model, possibly explained by lower cellular internalization and less blood-rich stroma in PC-3 PIP xenografts. Mice bearing subcutaneous PC-3 PIP xenografts were treated with 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 MBq of Pb-212-NG001 that resulted in therapeutic indexes of 2.7, 3.0, and 3.5, respectively. A significant increase in treatment response was observed in mice that received repeated injections compared to the corresponding single dose (therapeutic indexes of 3.6 for 2 x 0.2 MBq and 4.4 for 2 x 0.4 MBq). The results indicate that Pb-212-NG001 can induce therapeutic effects at clinically transferrable doses, both in the C4-2 model that resembles solid tumors and micrometastases with natural PSMA expression and in the PC-3 PIP model that mimics poorly vascularized metastases.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate the binding characteristics of the D(2) receptor radioligand (18)F-(3-N-methyl)benperidol ((18)FMB) in rat striatum by determining receptor density (B(max)) and affinity (K(d)) in vivo. For validation, K(d) and B(max) additionally were determined in vitro using storage phosphor autoradiography. Methods: Striatal radioactivity was measured with PET in 8 Sprague-Dawley rats after injection of (18)FMB in increasing specific activities. Free radioligand concentrations were estimated from cortical radioactivity concentrations and were subtracted from striatal radioactivity concentrations to obtain specific binding. In vitro saturation experiments were performed on 7 further rats according to the isotopic dilution method. Specific binding was determined by both subtraction of (18)FMB binding in the presence of raclopride and subtraction of cortical radioactivity concentrations from total radioligand binding. Saturation binding curves were obtained by plotting specifically bound radioligand concentrations against free radioligand concentrations and were evaluated with regression analysis. Results: PET yielded a K(d) of 6.2 nmol/L and a B(max) of 16 fmol/mg for the striatal D(2) receptor. In vitro, K(d) and B(max) amounted to 4.4 nmol/L and 84.1 fmol/mg (subtraction of (18)FMB binding in the presence of raclopride), respectively, and 7.9 nmol/L and 70.1 fmol/mg (subtraction of cortical radioactivity concentrations), respectively. Conclusion: K(d) values measured with PET and autoradiography agreed and corresponded to inhibition constants obtained in previous in vitro studies. B(max) values lay within the same order of magnitude. The results of in vitro saturation binding analyses also agreed, irrespective of the mode of determination of free radioligand concentrations. Thus, B(max) and K(d) may be determined with PET in analogy to the evaluation of in vitro binding data by regression analysis of bound-versus-free ligand concentrations. Our results show that small-animal tomographs are valuable tools for the in vivo characterization of receptor radioligands as an alternative to autoradiography.

PSMA-based theranostics for prostate cancer From imaging to treatment	UROLOGE			German	Article						Prostatic neoplasms; Nuclear medicine; Prostate-specific mebrane antigen; Radiopharmaceuticals; Radioligand therapy	GA-68	Background In recent years nuclear medicine theranostics using radiolabeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands have gained increasing importance in the management of prostate cancer. Aim The aim of this work is to highlight the value of theranostic concepts using radiolabeled PSMA ligands for both the diagnostic work-up and treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Material and methods The currently available knowledge in the literature is summarized and presented. Results The use of PSMA in positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) shows a high sensitivity and specificity for prostate cancer imaging, particularly in patients with biochemical recurrences. Furthermore, promising results are also reported for staging of primary prostate cancer and treatment monitoring. In addition, radioligand therapy using alpha and beta emitters is a promising third line treatment option in intensively pretreated patients with metastases. The reduction of side effects and optimization of the treatment sequence of radioligand therapy is of increasing importance. Conclusion Nuclear medicine theranostics have an increasing clinical impact on the diagnostics and treatment of prostate cancer.

GPCRs in general and cannabinoid CB1 receptor in particular show a progressive tendency to aggregate and precipitate in aqueous solution outside of their biological context due to the low solubility that the hydrophobic nature imprinted by their seven transmembrane domains. This renders full-length recombinant GPCRs useless for analytical purposes, a problem that can be overcome by engineering soluble recombinant fragments of the receptor containing the antigen. Results: Here we generated highly soluble and stable recombinant protein constructs GST-CB1(41)(4-)(472 )and GST-CB1(414-442) containing much of the human CB1 receptor C-terminal tail for use as standard and negative control, respectively, in quantitative Western blot analysis of CB1 receptor expression on crude synaptosomes of the adult rat brain cortex. To this end we used three different antibodies, all raised against a peptide comprising the C-terminal residues 443-473 of the mouse CB1 receptor that corresponds to residues 442-472 in the human homolog. Estimated values of CB1 receptor density obtained by quantitative Western blot were of the same order of magnitude but slightly higher than values obtained by the radioligand saturation binding assay. Conclusions: Collectively, here we provide a suitable Western blot-based design as a simple, cost-effective and radioactivity-free alternative for the quantitative analysis of CB1 receptor expression, and potentially of any GPCR, in a variety of biological samples. The discrepancies between the results obtained by quantitative Western blot and radioligand saturation binding techniques are discussed in the context of their particular theoretical bases and methodological constraints.

The modest economic prospects of most diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals have not attracted keen interest from the broader business community, despite the rapid advancement of diagnostic imaging capabilities and their increasingly crucial role in the therapeutic process. Similarly, compelling science supporting select radiopharmaceutical therapies in oncology has been overshadowed by the unique challenges posed by this class of drugs and historical commercial failures that serve as sobering reminders of risk. Fortunately, a few notable successes in the targeted radioligand therapeutic space are changing this dynamic, fueling a new flow of investor capital into these technologies and inciting increased merger and acquisition activity that has yielded significant value creation for investors. If the nuclear medicine industry is able to continue to effectively manage historical challenges, then there is significant opportunity for a new and promising wave of radioligand therapies to significantly change the oncology treatment paradigm and elevate the profile of the entire nuclear medicine sector.

Synthesis of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PS13 and Evaluation as a PET Radioligand for Cyclooxygenase-1 in Monkey	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Fluorine-18; PS13; radioligand; nucleophilic addition; PET; COX-1; brain imaging	IN-VIVO EVALUATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CURIE LEVEL; RADIOSYNTHESIS; BINDING; TAU; DERIVATIVES	Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and its isozyme COX-2 are key enzymes in the syntheses of prostanoids. Imaging of COX-1 and COX-2 selective radioligands with positron emission tomography (PET) may clarify how these enzymes are involved in inflammatory conditions and assist in the discovery of improved anti-inflammatory drugs. We have previously labeled the selective high-affinity COX-1 ligand, 1,5-bis(4-methoxyphenyl)-3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)-1H-1,2,4-triazole (PS13), with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min). This radioligand ([C-11]PS13) has been successful for PET imaging of COX-1 in monkey and human brain and in periphery. [C-11]PS13 is being used in clinical investigations. Alternative labeling of PS13 with fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min) is desirable to provide a longer-lived radioligand in high activity that might be readily distributed among imaging centers. However, labeling of PS13 in its 1,1,1-trifluoroethoxy group is a radiochemical challenge. Here we assess two labeling approaches based on nucleophilic addition of cyclotron-produced [F-18]fluoride ion to gemdifluorovinyl precursors, either to label PS13 in one step or to produce [F-18]2,2,2-trifluoroethyl p-toluenesulfonate for labeling a hydroxyl precursor. From the latter two-step approach, we obtained [F-18]PS13 ready for intravenous injection in a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 7.9% and with a molar activity of up to 7.9 GBq/mu mol. PET imaging of monkey brain with [F-18]PS13 shows that this radioligand can specifically image and quantify COX-1 without radiodefluorination but with some radioactivity uptake in skull, ascribed to red bone marrow. The development of a new procedure for labeling PS13 with fluorine-18 at a higher molar activity is, however, desirable to suppress occupancy of COX-1 by carrier at baseline.

Compound 6 was radiolabelled with fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min) for PET studies in monkeys. In vivo PET measurements showed a regional distribution in brain that corresponds to the known distribution of DAT. This binding was specific, reversible and the kinetics of [(18)F] 6 binding in brain were faster than for its lead compound, [(11)C]1. The possible presence of a hydroxy-methyl-radiometabolite formed by oxidation in the 3 beta-benzylic position of [(18)F]6 warrants further detailed evaluation of the metabolism of [(18)F]6. [(18)F]6 is a potential radioligand for imaging DATs in the human brain with PET. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The availability of a selective radioligand for the D-4 receptor with suitable properties for positron emission tomography (PET) would help resolve issues of D-4 receptor localization in the brain, and the presumed diurnal change of expressed protein in the eye and pineal gland. We report here on in vitro and in vivo characteristics of the high-affinity D-4 receptor-selective ligand N-{2-[4-(3-cyanopyridin-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl] ethyl}-3-[C-11] methoxybenzamide ([C-11]2) in rat. The results provide new insights on the in vitro properties that a brain PET dopamine D-4 radioligand should possess in order to have improved in vivo utility in rodents.

Radioligand therapy using beta-emitting Lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-labeled-PSMA-617, a radiolabeled small molecule, has gained attention as a novel targeted therapy for metastatic prostate cancer, given its high affinity and long tumor retention, and rapid blood pool clearance. In March 2022, the United States Food and Drug administration has granted approval to the targeted Lu-177-PSMA-617 therapy for treatment of patients with PSMA-positive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer, who have been previously treated with an androgen-receptor pathway inhibitor and taxane-based chemotherapy. Studies have demonstrated the adverse effects of this treatment, mainly encountered due to radiation exposure to non-target tissues. Salivary glands show high PSMA-ligand uptake and receive increased radiation dose secondary to accumulation of Lu-177-PSMA-617. This predisposes the glands to radiation-mediated toxicity. The exact mechanism, scope and severity of radiation-mediated salivary gland toxicity are not well understood, however, the strategies for its prevention and treatment are under evaluation. This review will focus on the current knowledge about salivary gland impairment post Lu-177 labeled PSMA-based radioligand therapies, diagnostic methodologies, and imaging with emphasis on salivary gland scintigraphy. The preventive strategies and known treatment options would also be briefly highlighted.

Such a selective radioligand can then be used for quantitative autoradiography, preclinical studies in animals and subsequent human PET applications. Recently, a promising candidate compound, 5-(2-fluoroethyl) 2,4-diethyl-3-(ethylsulfanylcarbonyl)-6-phenylpyridine-5-carboxylate (FE@SUPPY), has been presented. The successful preparation of a suitable labelling precursor and the evaluation and optimization of the radiosynthesis of [F-18] FE@SUPPY is presented herewith. For satisfactory yields, a reaction temperature of 75 degrees C has to be applied for at least 20 min using 8-10 mg of precursor. Until now, 15 complete high-scale radiosyntheses were performed. Starting from an average of 51 +/- 12 GBq (average +/- SD; range: 30-67 GBq) [F-18]fluoride, 9.4 +/- 3.6 GBq of formulated [F-18]FE@SUPPY (32.3 +/- 12.4%, based on [(18)]fluoride, corrected for decay) were prepared in < 105 min.

In the present study, DPA-713 has been labelled from the corresponding nor-analogue using [C-11]methyl triflate (CH3OTf). Conditions for HPLC were also modified to include physiological saline (aq. 0.9% NaCl)/ethano1:60/40 as mobile phase making it suitable for injection. The total time of radiosynthesis, including HPLC purification, was 18-20 min. This reported synthesis of [C-11]DPA-713, using [C-11]CH3OTf, resulted in an improved radiochemical yield (30-38%) compared to [C-11]methyl iodide (CH3I) (9) with a simpler purification method. This ultimately enhances the potential of [C-11]DPA-713 for further pharmacological and clinical evaluation. These improvements make this radioligand more suitable for automated synthesis which is of benefit where multi-dose preparations and repeated syntheses of radioligand are required.

Both radioligands can be successfully utilized to reach equilibrium distributions in rat brain within 1 h; combinations of tritiated and carbon-11-labeled radiotracers can furthermore be used to obtain simultaneous measures of the neuronal membrane dopamine transporter (using [H-3]MePhen) and vesicular monoamine transporter (using [C-11]DTBZ) in the same animal. These studies provided quantitative measures of distribution volume ratios, which represent specific radioligand binding. Stereospecificity of in vivo binding was demonstrated using equilibrium infusions of the low-affinity isomers of each ligand, (-)-alpha-[C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) and 1-threo-[C-11]methylphenidate, both of which produced uniform brain distributions and no specific binding. Specific binding of (+)-alpha-[C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine was blocked by co-infusion of tetrabenazine, but was unaffected by administration of methylphenidate, haloperidol, or apomorphine. Specific binding of d-threo-[C-11]methylphenidate, conversely, was blocked with unlabeled methylphenidate but not affected by tetrabenazine or the dopamine receptor ligands. Equilibrium measures of in vivo radioligand binding, as utilized in this study, offer a quantitative means to evaluate acute and chronic drug effects on in vivo radioligand binding in the rat brain.

A better understanding of the pathophysiological role of the expression of PDE10A could be obtained by quantitative imaging of the enzyme by positron emission tomography (PET). Thus, in this study we developed, radiolabeled, and evaluated a new PDE10A radioligand, 8-bromo-1-(6-[F-18]fluoropyridin-3-yl)-3,4-dimethylimidazo[1,5-a]quinoxaline ([F-18]AQ28A). [F-18]AQ28A was radiolabeled by both nucleophilic bromo-to-fluoro or nitro-to-fluoro exchange using K[F-18]F-K-2.2.2-carbonate complex with different yields. Using the superior nitro precursor, we developed an automated synthesis on a Tracerlab FX F-N module and obtained [F-18]AQ28A with high radiochemical yields (33 +/- 6%) and specific activities (96-145GBqmol(-1)) for further evaluation. Initially, we investigated the binding of [F-18]AQ28A to the brain of different species by autoradiography and observed the highest density of binding sites in striatum, the brain region with the highest PDE10A expression. Subsequent dynamic PET studies in mice revealed a region-specific accumulation of [F-18]AQ28A in this region, which could be blocked by preinjection of the selective PDE10A ligand MP-10. In conclusion, the data suggest [F-18]AQ28A is a suitable candidate for imaging of PDE10A in rodent brain by PET.

Radioligand Binding to Nanodisc-Reconstituted Membrane Transporters Assessed by the Scintillation Proximity Assay	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; SUBSTRATE; CONFORMATION; BILAYER	The scintillation proximity assay is a powerful technique for measuring radioligand binding to membrane transporters and has become an integral part of high-throughput drug discovery screening efforts. Here we adapt the method for use with purified LeuT, a prokaryotic secondary transporter, reconstituted into phospholipid bilayer nanodiscs. This application surmounts potential challenges with background interference from endogenously expressed proteins, aggregation and loss of binding activity often accompanying detergent solubilization from native cell membranes, and heterogeneity in size and transporter orientation, where at least some ligand binding sites are inaccessible, associated with reconstitution into lipid vesicles.

Synthesis and preliminary pharmacological evaluation of a new putative radioiodinated AMPA receptor ligand for molecular imaging	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Radioiodine; Destannylation; AMPA; Glutamate; Isoquinoline; Neuroimaging		A new (radio)iodinated AMPA receptor ligand has been developed and pharmacologically evaluated in vitro and ex vivo using rodents. The new radioligand was directly labeled by electrophilic radioiodo-destannylation with iodine-131 in high radiochemical yields of 97% within 2 min. The new radioligand showed an excellent initial brain uptake of 2.1 % ID/g at 10 min post injection, but a fast wash-out reduced the uptake by about 10-fold at 60 min post injection. Due to high nonspecific binding accompanied with a uniform distribution in brain tissue, however, the new radiotracer appears not suitable for AMPA receptor imaging in vivo.	[Ross, T.

Characterization of P2X4 receptor agonists and antagonists by calcium influx and radioligand binding studies	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						ATP; Frozen cells; Radioligand binding; Species differences; Structure-activity relationships	P2X(4) RECEPTOR; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PURINERGIC RECEPTORS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; SPINAL MICROGLIA; P2Y RECEPTORS; UP-REGULATION; NERVE INJURY; ION-CHANNEL; BRAIN	Antagonists for ATP-activated P2X4 ion channel receptors are currently in the focus as novel drug targets, in particular for the treatment of neuropathic and inflammatory pain. We stably expressed the human, rat and mouse P2X4 receptors in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells, which is devoid of functional nucleotide receptors, by retroviral transfection, and established monoclonal cell lines. Calcium flux assay conditions were optimized for high-throughput screening resulting in a Z'-factor of >0.8. The application of ready-to-use frozen cells did not negatively affect the results of the calcium assays, which is of great advantage for the screening of compound libraries. Species differences were observed, the rat P2X4 receptor being particularly insensitive to many ATP derivatives. Membrane preparations of the cell lines showed high levels of specific [S-35]ATP gamma S binding with low nonspecific binding (<5% of total binding), while non-transfected cells were devoid of specific binding sites for the radioligand. Conditions were employed which allow binding studies to be performed at room temperature. While a variety of nucleotide-derived agonists and the antagonist TNP-ATP displaced [S-35]ATP gamma S from its binding site at human P2X4 receptors, the non-nucleotidic antagonists paroxetine and 5-BDBD did not compete with radioligand binding and were therefore characterized as allosteric antagonists. Homology modeling was applied to find an explanation for the observed species differences. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Scaffold Repurposing of Nucleosides (Adenosine Receptor Agonists): Enhanced Activity at the Human Dopamine and Norepinephrine Sodium Symporters	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BIOGENIC-AMINE TRANSPORTERS; CHRONIC NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOLECULAR-CLONING; COCAINE-ABUSE; BINDING; DERIVATIVES; ANTAGONISTS; DEPRESSION; INHIBITORS; DESIGN	We have repurposed (N)-methanocarba adenosine derivatives (A(3) adenosine receptor (AR) agonists) to enhance radioligand binding allosterically at the human dopamine (DA) transporter (DAT) and inhibit DA uptake. We extended the structure-activity relationship of this series with small N-6-alkyl substitution, 5'-esters, deaza modifications of adenine, and ribose restored in place of methanocarba. C2-(5-Halothien-2-yl)-ethynyl 5'-methyl 9 (MRS7292) and 5'-ethyl 10 (MRS7232) esters enhanced binding at DAT (EC50 similar to 35 nM) and at the norepinephrine transporter (NET). 9 and 10 were selective for DAT compared to A(3)AR in the mouse but not in humans. At DAT, the binding of two structurally dissimilar radioligands was enhanced; NET binding of only one radioligand was enhanced; SERT radioligand binding was minimally affected. 10 was more potent than cocaine at inhibiting DA uptake (IC50 = 107 nM). Ribose analogues were weaker in DAT interaction than the corresponding bicyclics. Thus, we enhanced the neurotransmitter transporter activity of rigid nucleosides while reducing A(3)AR affinity.

Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of Pyridine-Based Ligands and Identification of a Fluorinated Derivative for Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Cannabinoid Type 2 Receptors	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CB2 RECEPTORS; VIVO EVALUATION; HIGH-AFFINITY; TARGET; RADIOLIGAND; AGONIST; BINDING	The cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor has emerged as a valuable target for therapy and imaging of immune mediated pathologies. With the aim to find a suitable radiofluorinated analogue of the previously reported CB2 positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]RSR-056, 38 fluorinated derivatives were synthesized and tested by in vitro binding assays. With a K-i (hCB2) of 6 nM and a selectivity factor of nearly 700 over cannabinoid type 1 receptors, target compound 3 exhibited optimal in vitro properties and was selected for evaluation as a PET radioligand. [F-18]3 was obtained in an average radiochemical yield of 11 +/- 4% and molar activities between 33 and 114 GBq/mu mol. Specific binding of [F-18]3 to CB2 was demonstrated by in vitro autoradiography and in vivo PET experiments using the CB2 ligand GW-405 833.

Imaging of neuroinflammation with radioligands for the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) could prove to be an attractive biomarker for disease diagnosis and therapeutic evaluation. The indoleacetamide-derived 7-chloro-N,N,5-trimethyl-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,5-dihydro-4H-pyridazino[4,5-b]indole-1-acetamide, SSR180575, is a selective high-affinity TSPO ligand in human and rodents with neuroprotective effects. Here we report the radiolabelling of SSR180575 with C-11 and in vitro and in vivo imaging in an acute model of neuroinflammation in rats. The image contrast and the binding of [C-11]SSR180575 are higher than that obtained with the isoquinoline-based TSPO radioligand, [C-11]PK11195. Competition studies demonstrate that [C-11]SSR180575 has high specific binding for the TSPO. [C-11]SSR180575 is the first PET radioligand for the TSPO based on an indoleacetamide scaffold designed for imaging neuroinflammation in animal models and in the clinic.

Drawing regions of interest (ROIs) on the PET images is used to measure the dose in each organ. In the study aspects related to ROI delineation methods were evaluated for two radioligands of different biodistribution (intestinal vs urinary). PET images were simulated from a human voxel-based phantom. Several ROI delineation methods were tested: antero-posterior projections (AP), 3D sub-samples of the organs (S), and a 3D volume covering the whole-organ (W). Inter- and intra-operator variability ROI drawing was evaluated by using human data. The effective dose estimates using S and W methods were comparable to the true values. AP methods overestimated (49 %) the dose for the radioligand with intestinal biodistribution. Moreover, the AP method showed the highest inter-operator variability: 11 +/- 1 %. The sub-sampled organ method showed the best balance between quantitative accuracy and inter- and intra-operator variability.

Increasing evidence suggests that PMC neurotransmitter receptors are involved in modulating immune responses. It is also thought that expression of PMC neurotransmitter receptors may reflect the status of homologous brain receptors. A problem encountered with assay of PMC neurotransmitter receptors was in developing techniques suitable for their assessment in spite of low density. In this paper we summarized findings on the expression of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor and dopamine receptor subtypes in human peripheral blood lymphocytes characterized by radioligand binding assay techniques and immunocytochemistry. Human lymphocytes express alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor subtypes and dopamine D3, D4 and D5 receptors. Compared to radioligand binding assay, immunocytochemistry applied to cytospin-centrifuged peripheral lymphocytes allowed to assay receptor subtypes investigated in small amounts of blood. The development of sensitive and reproducible techniques for assaying PMC neurotransmitter receptor subtypes even in small amounts of blood such as those used for diagnostic Purposes may allow to analyze their sensitivity to different conditions including radiation exposure.

Importance of the C-terminus of the human 5-HT3A receptor subunit	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						LGIC; 5-HT(3)A receptor 5-HT3A receptor subunit; C-terminus; Protein folding and stability	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; TEMPERATURE-SENSITIVE EXPRESSION; CELL-SURFACE EXPRESSION; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(3) RECEPTORS; MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; BINDING PROTEIN; CYSTIC-FIBROSIS; LIGAND-BINDING; CLONING	Amongst the family members of Cys-loop LGICs, the atypical ability of the 5-HT3A subunit to form functional homomeric receptors allowed a direct investigation of the role of the C-terminus. Deletion of the three C-terminal amino acids (Delta GIn(453)-Delta Tyr(454)-Delta Ala(455)) from the h5-HT3A subunit prevented formation of a specific radioligand binding site as well as expression within the cell membrane. Removal of merely the C-terminal residue (Delta Ala(455)) reduced specific radioligand binding(to 4 +/- 1% relative to the wild-type; cells grown at 37 degrees C and also cell membrane expression; these reductions were less evident when the Delta Ala(455) expressing cells were grown at 27 degrees C (specific radioligand binding levels 27 +/- 5% relative to wild-type also grown at 27 degrees C). Mutation of the h5-HT3A C-terminal amino acid, alanine, for either glycine (Ala(455)Gly), valine (Ala(455)Val) or leucine (Ala(455)Leu) reduced specific radioligand binding levels by 24 +/- 23%, 32 +/- 12% and 88 +/- 1%, respectively; the latter mutant also displaying reduced membrane expression. In contrast, mutation to alanine of the two amino acids preceding the C-terminal alanine (Gln(453) Ala and Tyr(454)Ala) had no detrimental effects on specific radioligand binding or cell membrane expression levels. The present study demonstrates an important role for the C-terminus in the formation of the functional h5-HT(3)A receptor. The partial restoration of 5-HT3 receptor binding and cell membrane expression when cells expressing C-terminal mutant 5-HT3A subunits were grown at a lower temperature (27 degrees C) suggests that the C-terminus stabilises the 5-HT3 receptor allowing subunit folding and subsequent maturation.

[F-18]FIMX ([F-18]4-fluoro-N-methyl-N-(4-(6-(methylamino) pyrimidin-4-yl)thiazol-2-yl)benzamide) is an effective radioligand for imaging brain mGluR1 with PET. A similarly effective radioligand with a shorter half-life would usefully allow PET studies of mGluR1 at baseline and after pharmacological or other challenge on the same day. Here we describe the preparation of [C-11]FIMX for evaluation in monkey with PET. Methods: [C-11]FIMX was prepared via Pd-promoted carbonylation of 1-fluoro-4-iodobenzene with [C-11]carbon monoxide, aminolysis of the [C-11]acyl-palladium complex with the requisite Boc-protected amine, and deprotection with HCl in THF. PET scans of [C-11]FIMX injected into a monkey were performed at baseline and after preblock of mGluR1 with measurement of the arterial input function. Results: The radiosynthesis required 42 min and gave [C-11]FIMX in about 5% overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield and with a specific activity of about 100 GBq/mu mol. PET in rhesus monkey at baseline showed that radioactivity peaked high in receptor-rich cerebellum and much lower in receptor-poor occipital cortex. Radioactivity in cerebellum declined to 32% of peak at 85 min. V-T at baseline appeared stable in all brain regions after 60 min. Under mGluR1 pre-blocked condition, radioactivity uptake in all regions declined more rapidly to a low level. Receptor pre-block reduced V-T from 13.0 to 1.5 in cerebellum and from 2.9 to 1.4 in occipital cortex. Conclusion: [C-11]FIMX is an effective radioligand for imaging mGluR1 in monkey with PET.

In contrast, an agonist radioligand binds preferentially to the high-affinity state and is expected to have greater sensitivity to DA, which is the endogenous agonist. [C-11]MNPA, (R)-2-CH3O-N-n-propylnorapomorphine (MNPA), is a D-2 agonist radioligand with subnanomolar affinity to the D-2 receptor. The aim of the present study is to assess and compare the sensitivity of the agonist radioligand [C-11]MNPA and antagonist radioligand [C-11]raclopride to synaptic DA levels. Four cynomolgus monkeys were examined with [C-11]MNPA and [C-11]raclopride (16 PET measurements with each tracer) at baseline and after pretreatment with various doses of amphetamine. The effect of amphetamine was calculated by the change in binding potential (BP) analyzed with the multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM2). Amphetamine caused a reduction in [C-11]MNPA BP of 4% at 0.1, 23% at 0.2, 25% at 0.5, and 46% at 1.0 mg/kg. [C-11]Raclopride BP was reduced to a lesser extent by 2% at 0.1, 16% at 0.2, 15% at 0.5, and 23% at 1.0 mg/kg. The data were used to estimate the in vivo percentage of high-affinity state receptors to be similar to 60%. These results demonstrate that [C-11]MNPA is more sensitive than [C-11]raclopride to displacement by endogenous DA, and that it may provide additional information about the functional state of the D-2 receptor in illnesses such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.

PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in prostate cancer	UROLOGE			German	Article						Radioligand therapy; Systemic therapy; Metastasis; Hormone therapy; Radiotherapy	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; LIGANDS	Radioligand therapy (RLT) directed against prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) enables tumor-specific treatment directed against PSMA-overexpressing prostate cancer cells. Several PSMA ligands such as PSMA-617 or PSMA-I&T have been developed that can be labeled with beta aEuroradiating lutetium-177. These are currently applied in compassionate use programs to treat metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). PSMA-directed RLT is currently being offered in several nuclear medicine departments throughout Germany. Several retrospective case series demonstrate its activity with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decrease > 50% in 30-60% of mCRPC patients. The toxicity seems to be low. Hematologic grade 4 toxicity has not been observed and grade 3 toxicities rarely occur. The main nonhematologic adverse events are intermittent dry mouth because of unspecific PSMA expression in the salivary glands as well as fatigue and nausea. Currently there are no prospective studies available for evaluation of PSMA-targeted RLT and a survival benefit over approved standard therapies such as abiraterone, enzalutamide, radium-223-dichloride, docetaxel or cabazitaxel has not been shown. PSMA-targeted RLT should therefore currently only be offered after critical evaluation in patients who exhausted the approved standard therapies.	[Heck, M.

Whereas contraction of the quinolinyl portion of the scaffold or cyclization of the tertiary amido group abolished high TSPO affinity, insertion of an extra nitrogen atom into the 2-arylquinolinyl portion was effective in retaining sub-nanomolar affinity for rat TSPO, while also decreasing lipophilicity to within the moderate range deemed preferable for a PET radioligand. Replacement of a phenyl group on the amido nitrogen with an isopropyl group was similarly effective. Among others, compound 20 (N-methyl-N-phenyl-2-[2-(pyridin-2-yl)-1,8-naphthyridin-4-yloxy]propanamide) appears especially appealing for PET radioligand development, based on high selectivity and high affinity (K-i = 0.5 nM) for rat TSPO, moderate lipophilicity (logD = 2.48), and demonstrated amenability to labeling with carbon-11.

Radioligand Binding Detection of Receptors in Brain Membranes	RECEPTOR AND ION CHANNEL DETECTION IN THE BRAIN: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS	Neuromethods		English	Article; Book Chapter						Radioligand; Membrane homogenates; Saturation binding assays; Competition binding assays; [S-35]GTP gamma S receptor binding; Affinity; Efficacy; Functionality	ASSAY; LIGAND	Transmitters, hormones, and most of the therapeutic drugs exert their biological functions by generating signals in target cells through interaction with a receptor molecule in the cellular membrane, cytosol, or even at the nucleus of the cell. Because receptors play such a crucial role in cell function, especially within the central nervous system (CNS), we need lab techniques to measure their expression and functionality. There are techniques to determine regulatory changes in receptor number (receptor density), subcellular distribution, anatomical distribution, the physiological function of the receptors, as well as the ligand affinity. Here we describe a classic way of doing this by exposing cells or tissue membranes to radiolabeled molecules (radioligands) that bind selectively to receptors in the sample (receptor binding assay). The functional consequence of the receptor occupancy or level of G-protein activation could be measured by [S-35] GTP gamma S binding assay. This assay measures the binding of the non-hydrolyzable analogue [S-35] GTP gamma S ([S-35] guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio) triphosphate) to G alpha subunits. [S-35] GTP gamma S binding assays, also known as functional binding assays, are carried out in a similar way as radioligand (receptor) binding assays. The above radiometric assays are useful to differentiate among agonist, antagonist, and inverse agonist activities, in addition to traditional pharmacological parameters of potency and efficacy, as well as receptor constitutive activity and agonist-specific G-protein-coupled signaling. Moreover, radioligand binding assays provide a powerful tool for screening drug candidates for many receptors in drug discovery research.

To date, characterization of this protein has been performed with recombinant protein only and without the availability of an ASIP/agouti radioligand. In this report we describe the functional characteristics of a chemically synthesized truncated ASIP variant, ASIP-[90-132 (L89Y)], and the binding characteristics of its cognate radioligand, I-125-ASIP-[90-132 (L89Y)]. Similar to full-length recombinant ASIP/agouti, ASIP-[90-132 (L89Y)] was a potent inhibitor of alpha -melanocyte-stimulating hormone cAMP generation at the cloned human melanocortin receptor (hMCR) subtypes hMC1R and hMC4R. It also displayed a lesser degree of inhibition at the hMC3R and hMC5R. However, ASIP-[90-132 (L89Y)] was found to be less potent than full-length recombinant ASIP and, surprisingly, only exhibited weak inhibitory activity at the hMC2R. In competition binding assays with the radioligand I-125-ASIP-[90-132 (L89Y)], ASIP-[90-132 (L89Y)] displayed a hierarchy of binding affinity that roughly paralleled its rank order of inhibitory potency at the various MCR subtypes, i.e., hMC1R approximate to hMC4R > hMC3R approximate to hMC5R > hMC2R. Structure-activity studies revealed that ASIP-[90-132 (L89Y)] possessed greater pharmacological potency than either the further truncated ASIP variants ASIP-(116-132) or cyclo(CRFFRSAC). Interestingly, the latter molecules were both weak agonists at the hMC1R. These studies further support the concept that ASIP/agouti inhibits melanocortin action by directly binding to target MCRs and provide additional insight into the structural requirements for maximal inhibitory potency.

Analyses suggested a single high-affinity site, with K-d values of 3.76 +/- 0.45 and 5.03 +/- 0.31 rim, and corresponding B-max values of 30.8 +/- 1.8 and 34.4 +/- 2.0 pmol mg protein(-1), in whole cell and membrane formats, respectively. Kinetic studies yielded similar K-d values. 3 Competition studies in whole cells revealed that the native orexin peptides display a low affinity for the OX1 receptor, with orexin-A displaying a similar tofive-fold higher affinity than orexin-B (K-i values of 318 +/- 158 and 1516 +/- 597 nM, respectively). 4 SB-334867, SB-408124 (1-(6,8-difluoro-2-methyl-quinolin-4-yl)-3-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-urea) and SB-410220 (1-(5,8-difluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-3-(4-dimethylamino-phenyl)-urea) all displayed high affinity for the OX1 receptor in both whole cell (K-i values 99 +/- 18, 57 +/- 8.3 and 19 +/- 4.5 nM, respectively) and membrane (K-i values 38 +/- 3.6, 27 +/- 4.1 and 4.5 +/- 0.2 nM, respectively) formats. 5 Calcium mobilisation studies showed that SB-334867, SB-408124 and SB-410220 are all functional antagonists of the OX1 receptor, with potencies in line with their affinities, as measured in the radioligand binding assays, and with approximately 50-fold selectivity over the orexin-2 receptor. 6 These studies indicate that [H-3]SB-674042 is a specific, high-affinity radioligand for the OX1 receptor. The availability of this radioligand will be a valuable tool with which to investigate the physiological functions of OX1 receptors.

In the recent past we have explored a pharmacophore skeleton acetamidobenzoxazolone for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of TSPO expression in brain. Here we evaluated a new radioligand for visualization of TSPO, namely [C-11]N-(2-methoxyoxyphenyl)-N-methyl-2-(5-nitro-2-oxobenzo[d]oxazol-3(2H)-yl)acetamide ([C-11]N '-MPB). This PET ligand exhibited high binding affinity towards TSPO (K-i = 4.9 nM) and a suitable lipophilicity (log D) of 2.08 for brain imaging. A biodistribution study on mice showed high accumulation of radioactivity in TSPO-rich organs, such as the lungs, heart, kidneys, and adrenal glands. Metabolite analysis of rat brain homogenate showed 98% intact [C-11]N '-MPB at 30 min after injection. To determine the specific binding of the radioligand with TSPO on neuroinflammation of the brain, in vitro autoradiography and PET studies were performed in an ischemic rat model. In vitro autoradiography indicated significantly increased binding on the ipsilateral side compared with that on the contralateral side of ischemic rat brains. This result was supported firmly by the contrast of radioactivity in PET images. Displacement experiments with PK11195 minimized the difference in radioactivity uptake between the two sides. In summary, [C-11]N '-MPB is a potential PET imaging radioligand for TSPO and, consequently, for gaining more insight for up-regulation of microglia during neuroinflammation.

Specific [I-125]human adrenomedullin(13-52) binding sites were very discretely distributed in the rat brain with enrichment seen in the choroid plexus and linings of the third, fourth and lateral ventricles, basolateral amygdaloid nuclei, neural lobe of the pituitary gland, the trigeminal nerves and in the granular cell layer of the cerebellum. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the discrete localization of adrenomedullin receptors in the mammalian brain. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The aim of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 based on human whole-body PET measurements. Methods PET scans were performed for a total of 6.4 h after the injection of 168.9 +/- 31.5 MBq of (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 in four healthy male subjects. Volumes of interest were drawn on the coronal images. Estimates of the absorbed dose of radiation were calculated using the OLINDA software. Results Uptake was largest in lungs, followed by liver, bladder, brain and other organs. Peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lung (21.6%ID at 0.3 h), liver (5.1%ID at 0.3 h), bladder (12.2%ID at 6 h) and brain (2.3%ID at 0.3 h). The largest absorbed dose was found in the urinary bladder wall (0.039 mGy/MBq). The calculated effective dose was 0.017 mSv/MBq. Conclusion Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the estimated radiation burden of (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 is lower than that of [F-18]FDG. The radioligand would allow multiple PET examinations in the same research subject per year.

Brain and Whole-Body Imaging in Rhesus Monkeys of <SUP>11</SUP>C-NOP-1A, a Promising PET Radioligand for Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ Peptide Receptors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						molecular imaging; positron emission tomography; nociceptin/orphanin peptide	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ANTI-OPIOID PEPTIDE; IN-VIVO; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ANTAGONIST SB-612111; ORPHANIN FQ; BINDING; LOCALIZATION; EXPRESSION; MODEL	Our laboratory developed (S)-3-(2'-fluoro-6',7'-dihydrospiro [piperidine-4,4'-thieno[3,2-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-fluorobenzyl)-N-methylpropanamide (C-11-NOP-1A), a new radioligand for the nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor, with high affinity (K-i, 0.15 nM) and appropriate lipophilicity (measured logD, 3.4) for PET brain imaging. Here, we assessed the utility of C-11-NOP-1A for quantifying NOP receptors in the monkey brain and estimated the radiation safety profile of this radioligand based on its biodistribution in monkeys. Methods: Baseline and blocking PET scans were acquired from head to thigh for 3 rhesus monkeys for approximately 120 min after C-11-NOP-1A injection. These 6 PET scans were used to quantify NOP receptors in the brain and to estimate radiation exposure to organs of the body. In the blocked scans, a selective nonradioactive NOP receptor antagonist (SB-612111; 1 mg/kg intravenously) was administered before C-11-NOP-1A. In all scans, arterial blood was sampled to measure the parent radioligand C-11-NOP-1A. Distribution volume (V-T; a measure of receptor density) was calculated with a compartment model using brain and arterial plasma data. Radiation-absorbed doses were calculated using the MIRD Committee scheme. Results: After C-11-NOP-1A injection, peak uptake of radioactivity in the brain had a high concentration (similar to 5 standardized uptake value), occurred early (similar to 12 min), and thereafter washed out quickly. V-T (mL . cm(-3)) was highest in the neocortex (similar to 20) and lowest in hypothalamus and cerebellum (similar to 13). SB-612111 blocked approximately 50%-70% of uptake and reduced V-T in all brain regions to approximately 7 mL . cm(-3). Distribution was well identified within 60 min of injection and stable for the remaining 60 min, consistent with only parent radioligand and not radiometabolites entering the brain. Whole-body scans confirmed that the brain had specific (i.e., displaceable) binding but could not detect specific binding in peripheral organs. The effective dose for humans estimated from the baseline scans in monkeys was 5.0 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: C-11-NOP-1A is a useful radioligand for quantifying NOP receptors in the monkey brain, and its radiation dose is similar to that of other C-11-labeled ligands for neuroreceptors. C-11-NOP-1A appears to be a promising candidate for measuring NOP receptors in the human brain.

We here report the in vitro characterization of [S-35](S)-2amino-4-chloro-N-(1-(4-phenyl-1-(propylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)benzamide ([S-35]ACPPB), a radiotracer developed from a potent and selective non-sarcosine-derived GlyT1 inhibitor, its use in autoradiographic studies to localize (S)-2-amino-6-chloro-N-(]-(4-phenyl-1-(propylsulfonyl)piperidin-4-yl)ethyl)benzamide (ACPPB) binding sites in rat and rhesus brain and for in vivo occupancy assays of competitive GlyT1 inhibitors. Methods: Functional potencies of unlabeled compounds were characterized by [C-14] glycine uptake into JAR (human placental choriocarcinoma) cells and synaptosomes. Radioligand binding studies were performed with tissue homogenates. Autoradiographic studies were performed on tissue slices. Results: ACPPB is a potent (K-d=1.9 nM), selective, GlyT1 inhibitor that, when radiolabeled with [S-35], is a well-behaved radioligand with low nondisplaceable binding. Autoradiographic studies of rat and rhesus brain slices with this ligand showed that specific binding sites were plentiful and nonhomogeneously distributed, with high levels of binding in the brainstem, cerebellar white matter, thalamus, cortical white matter and spinal cord gray matter. In vivo studies demonstrate displaceable binding of [35 S]ACPPB in rat brain tissues following iv administration of this radioligand. Conclusions: This is the first report of detailed anatomical localization of GlyT1 using direct radioligand binding, and the first demonstration that an in vivo occupancy assay is feasible, suggesting that it may also be feasible to develop positron emission tomography tracers for GlyT1.

Synthesis and initial evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C](<i>R</i>)-RWAY in monkey -: a new, simply labeled antagonist radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors with PET	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						5-HT1A receptor; PET; radioligand; [ C-11]( R)-RWAY; Imaging	IN-VIVO; RADIOACTIVE METABOLITES; HUMAN PLASMA; QUANTIFICATION; BINDING; INHIBITION; BEHAVIOR; POTENT; CORTEX; SIGNAL	Purpose We aimed to fulfill a need for a radioligand that may be simply labeled with carbon-11 for effective positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of brain 5-HT1A receptors. Methods Racemic RWAY (2,3,4,5,6,7-hexahydro-1-[4-[1-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazinyl]]-2-phenylbutyryl]-1H-azepine) has high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. The enantiomers of RWAY and O-desmethyl-RWAY, synthesized from commercially available materials, were each labeled with carbon-11 by treating the respective O-desmethyl precursor with [C-11]iodomethane, and injected into rhesus monkey for measurement of regional brain uptake. The 5-HT1A selectivity of (R)-[C-11]RWAY was checked by administering WAY-100635, before and after radioligand administration. Radiometabolites of (R)-[C-11]RWAY in blood and urine were analyzed by HPLC with partial elucidation of their structures by LC-MS-MS. Results (R)-[C-11]RWAY was a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist exhibiting high brain uptake with regional distribution consistent with specific binding to 5-HT1A receptors. The similar affinity, (S)-[C-11]RWAY was a weak partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors exhibiting similar brain peak uptake with much less 5-HT1A receptor-specific binding. The maximal ratio in receptor-rich cingulate gyrus to receptor-devoid cerebellum reached 6.4 at 87.5 min after injection of (R)-[C-11]RWAY. After treatment with WAY-100635 before or after (R)-[C-11]RWAY administration, radioactivity levels in 5-HT1A receptor-rich regions were reduced almost to that in cerebellum. Blood and urine radiometabolites were less lipophilic than parent and were not due to hydrolysis but to ring hydroxylations, oxidation, and dephenylation. Conclusion (R)-[C-11]RWAY is simply prepared and an effective antagonist for imaging brain 5-HT1A receptors. This radioligand resists hydrolysis in vivo, gives less lipophilic radiometabolites, and warrants further PET studies in human subjects.

Binding of [3 H]MethoxyPyEP to rat cortex, hippocampus, thalamus and cerebellum membrane preparations revealed saturable, high affinity binding (3.4 +/- 0.4 nM, n = 4 in rat cortex) to a single population of receptors in all regions studied except for cerebellum. Binding was found to be relatively insensitive to pH and insensitive to DTT. High concentrations of NEM both reduce receptor concentration and binding affinity for the radioligand. In time-course studies at room temperature k(on) and k(off) were determined as 2.9 x 10(7) M-1 min(-1) and 0.11 min(-1) respectively. The rank order of affinities, as assessed by equilibrium competition studies, of a variety of ligands suggested binding of the radioligand selectively to mGluR5 (MPEP > trans-azetidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid congruent to (S)-4-carboxyphenylglycine congruent to (+)MK801 congruent to CP-101,606 congruent to clozapine congruent to atropine congruent to ketanserin congruent to yohimbine congruent to benoxathian). Autoradiographic studies with [H-3]MethoxyPyEP showed that binding was regioselective, with high density of binding in caudate and hippocampus, intermediate binding in thalamus and very low density in the cerebellum. These data show that [3 H]MethoxyPyEP is a high affinity radioligand useful for the in vitro study of mGluR5 receptor distribution and pharmacologic properties in brain.

Early and non-invasive determination of the sensitivity of the tumor and its metastases towards Imatinib by positron emission tomography (PET) would be beneficial for therapy planning and monitoring. Methods: We developed a synthesis strategy towards the precursor molecule, performed the F-18-synthesis and in the following evaluated the radioligand in vitro regarding its lipophilicity, stability and biological activity (KIT binding properties) as well as its in vivo properties in GIST tumor-bearing mice. Results: [F-18]fluoronorimatinib could be obtained in an overall radiochemical yield of 22.2 +/- 3.3% within 90 min. The radioligand showed high GIST cell uptake and was able to distinguish between Imatinib-sensitive and resistant tumor cell lines (GIST -T1, GIST882, GIST430) in vitro. Further biological evaluations of the ligand towards 9 different GIST-relevant KIT mutations showed comparable binding affinities compared to the structural lead Norimatinib (65 nM vs. 53 nM for wt-KIT). The in vivo evaluation of the newly developed radioligand showed tumor-to-background-ratios comparable to previously described, similar radiotracers. Conclusions: Thus, [F-18]fiuoronorimatinib is able to distinguish between Imatinib-resistant and sensitive KIT mutations. Although no improvement of in vivo tumor-to-background ratios could be achieved compared to formerly described radioligands, the hepatic uptake could be considerably reduced, being advantageous for the imaging of GIST. Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: We were able to show that it is possible to significantly reduce the unfavorably high hepatic uptake of small-molecule radioligands applicable for GIST PET imaging. This work can thus be the basis for further work intending to develop a PET-radioligand for Imatinibdependent GIST imaging. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on both association/dissociation kinetic and equilibrium saturation binding studies in transfected HEK cells, [H-3]-L 748,337 exhibited an affinity of approximately 2 nM for human beta(3)-adrenoceptors. Competition studies with agonists and subtype selective antagonists validated its binding to beta(3)-adrenoceptors. In CHO cells transfected with human beta(3)-adrenoceptors similar saturable high affinity of [H-3]-L 748,337 was observed. While some isoprenaline-sensitive [H-3]-L 748,337 binding was also observed in CHO cells transfected with human beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenoceptors, this was not saturable in a similar concentration range and/or not sensitive to the antagonists propranolol and SR 59,230, indicating that it did not primarily involve beta-adrenoceptors. In CHO cells transfectecl with rat beta(3)-adrenoceptors [H-3]-L 748,337 exhibited a considerably lower affinity than with the human subtype (12-95 nM). Low affinity for the rat beta(3)-adrenoceptor was also found with unlabelled L 748,337 in rat bladder strip relaxation experiments. We conclude that L 748,337 apparently has lower affinity for the rat than the human beta(3)-adrenoceptors and that [H-3]-L 748,337 can bind to a low-affinity site distinct horn the orthosteric pocket of beta-adrenoceptors. Nevertheless, [H-3]-L 748,337 appears to be the most promising radioligand for the selective labelling of human beta(3)-adrenoceptors reported to date. (C) 2013 Elsevier EN. All rights reserved.

Presentation of the therapy landscape in mCRPC and the current challenges within treatment and survey of the available data on Lu-177-PSMA-RLT after PubMed-based research. In several larger retrospective studies, Lu-177-PSMA-RLT seems to be an encouraging new option with the potential to extend overall survival while displaying a favorable toxicity profile. Prospective trials are urgently needed to confirm these encouraging results found in retrospective analyses with Lu-177-PSMA-RLT in the treatment of mCRPC.	[Boegemann, M.; Schrader, A.

[H-3]-Methyllycaconitine ([H-3]-MLA) is a novel radioligand which is a potent antagonist at vertebrate alpha7-type nAChR. Putative invertebrate nAChR of the aphid Myzus persicae, the moths Heliothis virescens and Manduca sexta, the fly Lucilia sericata, and the squid Loligo vulgaris were investigated in radioligand binding studies with [H-3]-MLA. Saturable binding was consistent with a single class of high affinity binding sites for each of these invertebrates, characterised by a dissociation constant, K-d, of approximately I nM and maximal binding capacities, B-max, between 749 and 1689 fmol/mg protein for the insects and 14,111 fmol/mg protein for squid. [H-3]-MLA binding to M. persicae membranes was characterised in more detail. Kinetic analysis demonstrated rapid association in a biphasic manner and slow, monophasic dissociation. Displacement studies demonstrate the nicotinic character of [H-3]-MLA binding sites. Data for all nicotinic ligands, except MLA itself, are consistent with displacement from a high and a low affinity site, indicating that displacement is occurring from two or more classes of nicotinic binding site that are not distinguished by MLA itself. Autoradiographic analysis of the distribution of [H-3]-MLA binding sites in Manduca sexta shows discrete labelling of neuropil areas of the optic and antennal lobes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to quantitate benzodiazepine receptor binding in human subjects using PET and high specific activity [C-11]Iomazenil. Six healthy human subjects underwent PET imaging following a bolus injection of high specific activity (>100 Ci/mmol) [C-11]iomazenil. Arterial samples were collected at multiple time points after injection for measurement of unmetabolized total and nonprotein-bound parent compound in plasma. Time activity curves of radioligand concentration in brain and plasma were analyzed using two and three compartment model. Kinetic rate constants of transfer of radioligand between plasma, nonspecifically bound brain tissue, and specifically bound brain tissue compartments were fitted to the model. Values for fitted kinetic rate constants were used in the calculation of measures of benzodiazepine receptor binding, including binding potential (the ratio of receptor density to affinity), and product of BP and the fraction of free nonprotein-bound parent compound (V-3'). Use of the three compartment model improved the goodness of fit in comparison to the two compartment model. Values for kinetic rate constants and measures. of benzodiazepine receptor binding, including BP and V-3', were similar to results obtained with the SPECT radioligand [I-123]iomazenil, and a prior report with low specific activity [C-11]Iomazenil. Kinetic modeling using the three compartment model with PET and high specific activity [C-11]Iomazenil provides a reliable measure of benzodiazepine receptor binding. Synapse 35:68-77, 2000.

To enhance the therapeutic effects of radioligands labeled with Ac-225 (half-life: 10 days), a radioligand that shows longer tumor retention would be useful. Here, we designed and synthesized a straight-chain PSMA-targeting radioligand, PSMADA1, which includes an (iodophenyl)butyric acid derivative as an albumin binder (ALB). We performed preclinical evaluations of PSMA-DA1 as a tool for PSMA-targeting radiotheranostics using In-111, 90Y, and Ac-225. [In-111]In-PSMA-DA1 demonstrated significantly greater tumor uptake and retention than a corresponding non-ALB-conjugated compound. In mice, single-photon emission computed tomography performed with [In-111]In-PSMA-DA1 produced clear tumor images, and the administration of [Y-90]Y-PSMA-DA1 or [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-DA1 inhibited tumor growth. [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-DA1 had antitumor effects in mice at a lower radioactivity level than [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA617, which has been reported to be clinically useful. These results indicate that PSMA-DA1 may be a useful PSMA-targeting radiotheranostic agent.

PDE10A is highly expressed in the striatum by medium spiny neurons, and it has been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of striatal signaling through the reduction of medium spiny neuronal sensitivity towards glutamatergic excitation. PDE10A is associated with Parkinson's disease and different neuropsychiatric disorders such as Huntington's disease, obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) and schizophrenia. Studies have indicated that the inhibition of PDE10A may represent a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of the aforementioned diseases characterized by the reduced activity of medium spiny neurons. An appropriate PET radioligand for PDE10A would help to facilitate drug development and drug evaluation. We have evaluated the [C-11]T-773 ligand in PDE10A knockout mice (heterozygous [HET] and homozygous [HOM]) as well as in normal control animals (WILD) with PET. The regional percent standardized uptake values (%SUV; mean +/- SD) in the striatum were 48.2 +/- 1.0 (HOM), 63.6 +/- 5.3 (HET) and 85.1 +/- 6.3 (WILD). Between each animal group the striatal %SUV values were significantly different (p < 0.0001). The striatal BPND values (mean +/- SD) were 0.0 +/- 0.0 (HOM), 0.14 +/- 0.07 (HET) and 0.56 +/- 0.15 (WILD). The BPND values were significantly lower in homozygous and heterozygous animals compared to wild type (p < 0.0001). The novel PDE10A radioligand [C-11]T-773 shows increased signals with higher levels of PDE10A and acceptable binding in the striatum in control animals compared to knockout mice.

Brain AT<sub>1</sub> Angiotensin Receptor Subtype Binding: Importance of Peptidase Inhibition for Identification of Angiotensin II as Its Endogenous Ligand	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							RAT-BRAIN; AMINO-ACID; AMINOPEPTIDASE; ENZYME; LOCALIZATION; AMASTATIN; PATHWAYS; ANALOGS	The existence and localization of brain angiotensin receptors is well established. However, questions regarding the endogenous ligand for brain angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) receptors necessitates re-examination of brain angiotensin receptor binding studies. To assess the ability of angiotensin II to bind to the brain AT(1) receptor, radioligand binding studies of rat brain AT(1) receptors were performed using both I-125-angiotensin II and I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II. Determination of binding kinetics and competition by an AT(1) receptor antagonist was carried out to reveal the identity of the membrane binding sites and to identify the bound I-125-labeled molecules. Initial analysis of I-125-angiotensin II binding to hypothalamic membranes using an established protocol revealed that a negligible amount of intact radioligand was bound to the membranes. In contrast, binding of I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II was saturable, of high affinity, and primarily as intact radioligand. Sequential addition of four peptidase inhibitors-o-phenanthroline, puromycin, phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, and glutamate phosphonate-to the assay buffer dramatically increased the binding of I-125-angiotensin II to rat brain membranes: more than 75% of the bound I-125 was the intact radioligand, and the binding was of high affinity and saturable. Some, but not all, of the binding could be displaced by the AT(1)-selective antagonist losartan. This demonstrates that I-125-angiotensin II can bind to brain AT(1) receptors and does not require conversion to I-125-angiotensin III to bind to brain AT(1) receptors.

Discovery of Pyrrolidine-Containing GPR40 Agonists: Stereochemistry Effects a Change in Binding Mode	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; TRANSGENIC MICE; BLADDER-CANCER; FATTY-ACIDS; POTENT; RECEPTOR; RISK; TAK-875; TUMORS; DEATH	A novel series of pyrrolidine-containing GPR40 agonists is described as a potential treatment for type 2 diabetes. The initial pyrrolidine hit was modified by moving the position of the carboxylic acid, a key pharmacophore for GPR40. Addition of a 4-cis-CF3 to the pyrrolidine improves the human GPR40 binding K-i and agonist efficacy. After further optimization, the discovery of a minor enantiomeric impurity with agonist activity led to the finding that enantiomers (R,R)-68 and (S,S)-68 have differential effects on the radioligand used for the binding assay, with (R,R)-68 potentiating the radioligand and (S,S)-68 displacing the radioligand. Compound (R,R)-68 activates both G(q)-coupled intracellular Ca2+ flux and G(s)-coupled cAMP accumulation. This signaling bias results in a dual mechanism of action for compound (R,R)-68, demonstrating glucose-dependent insulin and GLP-1 secretion in vitro. In vivo, compound (R,R)-68 significantly lowers plasma glucose levels in mice during an oral glucose challenge, encouraging further development of the series.

The current study analyzed disease-related quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing PSMA therapy with a special focus on the association with simultaneous PSA response. Methods Thirty patients (age range 50-87 years, median 73.5 years) undergoing(177)Lu-PSMA-617 therapy from 2014 to 2016 at our institution were included in this pilot study. Health-related QoL was assessed by EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire filled in at baseline and two months after initializing the PSMA-therapy. The treatment response was evaluated under three categories with regard to changes in (a) global health status and other functional scales, (b) disease-related symptoms, and (c) effects of PSA values. Results Most patients underwent three treatment cycles (n = 12); at least 2 cycles (n = 6) or at most 8 cycles (n = 1) were performed. Out of 30 cases, PSA response after the first cycle was observed in 73 % (n = 22). Compared to baseline, QoL was significantly improved at 2-month follow-up revealing increase in global health status (p = 0.025), role functioning (p = 0.017) and emotional functioning (0.010), and decrease in pain (p = 0.033). Global health status variation can be explained up to 20.5 % by response in PSA (p = 0.012), this improved with PSA reduction. Conclusion PSMA radioligand therapy seems to be an effective treatment option of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients as it improves their QoL in terms of increasing global health and mitigation of disease-related pain.

Benocyclidine (BTCP) as Non-labelled Reporter Ligand for MS Binding Assays for the PCP Ion Channel Binding Site of the Desensitized Torpedo Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor (nAChR)	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article; Early Access						MS Binding Assays; PCP binding site; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor	PHENCYCLIDINE; DISPLACEMENT; QUINACRINE; MUSCLE	In this study we present MS Binding Assays for the PCP ion channel binding site of Torpedo californica nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) as an alternative to radioligand binding assays. As MS Marker Benocyclidine (BTCP) was employed, found to be more affine (K-d of 84.2 nM) than the radioligands, e. g. [H-3]PCP, used so far in respective binding assays. Based on a highly sensitive and fast LC-ESI-MS/MS method for quantification of BTCP samples, BTCP MS Binding Assays for the PCP ion channel binding site of Torpedo nAChR could be established comprising saturation, kinetic and competition experiments. The affinities obtained in competitive BTCP MS Binding Assays for ligands addressing the PCP ion channel binding site of Torpedo nAChR were in excellent accord with those reported from radioligand experiments. Thus, the new BTCP MS Binding Assays represent a potent and reliable alternative to radioligand binding assays used so far for the characterization of ligand binding to the PCP ion channel binding site of the nAChR.

Evaluation of 5<i>H</i>-Thiazolo[3,2-α]pyrimidin-5-ones as Potential GluN2A PET Tracers	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article						receptor; imaging agent; radiochemistry; NMDA; defluorination	POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; RAT-BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND	We describe here our efforts to develop a PET tracer for imaging GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, based on a 5H-thiazolo[3,2-alpha]pyrimidin-5-one scaffold. The metabolic stability and overall properties could be optimized satisfactorily, although binding affinities remained a limiting factor forin vivoimaging. We nevertheless identified 7-(((2-fluoroethyl)(3-fluorophenyl)amino)-methyl)-3-(2-(hydroxymethyl)cyclopropyl)-2-methyl-5H-thiazolo-[3,2-alpha]pyrimidin-5-one ([F-18]7b) as a radioligand providing good-quality images in autoradiographic studies, as well as a tritiated derivative, 2-(7-(((2-fluoroethyl)(4-fluorophenyl)amino)methyl)-2-methyl-5-oxo-5H-thiazolo[3,2-alpha]pyrimidin-3-yl)cyclopropane-1-carbonitrile ([H-3(2)]15b), which was used for the successful development of a radioligand binding assay. These are valuable new tools for the study of GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors, and for the optimization of allosteric modulators binding to the pharmacophore located at the dimer interface of the GluN1-GluN2A ligand-binding domain.

In this study, we developed a novel PET radioligand for CSF1R, C-11-GW2580, and compared it to a reported CSF1R tracer, C-11-CPPC, in mouse models of acute and chronic neuroinflammation and a rhesus monkey. Dynamic C-11-GW2580- and C-11-CPPC-PET images were quantified by reference tissue-based models and standardized uptake value ratio. Both tracers exhibited increased uptake in the lesioned striata of lipopolysaccharide-injected mice and in the forebrains of App(NL-G-F/NL-G-F)-knock-in mice, spatially in agreement with an increased 18-kDa translocator protein radioligand retention. Moreover, C-11-GW2580 captured changes in CSF1R availability more sensitively than C-11-CPPC, with a larger dynamic range and a smaller inter-individual variability, in these model animals. PET imaging of CSF1R in a rhesus monkey displayed moderate-to-high tracer retention in the brain at baseline. Homologous blocker (i. e. unlabeled tracer) treatment reduced the uptake of C-11-GW2580 by similar to 30% in all examined brain regions except for centrum semi-ovale white matter, but did not affect the retention of C-11-CPPC. In summary, our results demonstrated that C-11-GW2580-PET captured inflammatory microgliosis in the mouse brain with higher sensitivity than a reported radioligand, and displayed saturable binding in the monkey brain, potentially providing an imaging-based quantitative biomarker for reactive microgliosis.

The aim of this study was to develop a radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the 5-HT1B receptor in the primate brain in vivo. Methods: Eight carboxamide radioligands (1-8) from three different core structures were radiolabeled with carbon-11 employing N-methylation with [C-11]methyl triflate on the piperazine structural moiety. In vivo PET evaluation of each radioligand was performed in cynomolgus monkeys and included analysis of radioactive metabolites measured in plasma using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: In a total of 12 radiosynthesis of the eight radioligands, the mean decay corrected yield was 11%, and the mean specific radioactivity was 299 CBq/mu mol (8075 Ci/mmol) at time of administration. Of the eight tested candidates, [C-11]6 demonstrated the most promising in vivo characteristics, showing high binding in 5-HT1B receptor-rich regions and low binding in the cerebellum. When inspecting data from all eight compounds, lipophilicity appeared as a physicochemical property that could be related to favorable in vivo imaging characteristics. Conclusion: Candidate [C-11]6, i.e., [C-11]AZ10419369, exhibited high binding potentials in regions known to contain 5-HT1B receptors and was nominated for further preclinical characterization and PET examination in human subjects.

PROCEDURES: The pyridinyl-6 [F-18]fluoro derivative of WAY-100635 ([F-18]6FPWAY) was obtained by direct nucleophilic substitution with [F-18]fluoride ion in a bromo precursor. After intravenous injection of [F-18]6FPWAY into Cynomolgus monkey, the uptake of radioactivity into brain regions was assessed with positron emission tomography (PET) and blood samples analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for parent radioligand and radioactive metabolites. The experiment was repeated after pretreatment of the monkey with a dose of WAY-100635 that blocks brain 5-HT1A receptors. RESULTS: After intravenous injection of [F-18]6FPWAY into Cynomolgus monkey, the uptake of radioactivity into whole brain reached 4.33% of injected dose at 7.5 min. Uptake was highest in 5-HT1A receptor-rich regions. Pretreatment with WAY-100635 reduced uptake in these regions to near the levels in receptor-devoid cerebellum. [F-18]6FPWAY was rapidly metabolized in vivo, as evidenced by the rapid appearance of radioactive metabolites in plasma. CONCLUSION: [F-18]6FPWAY is selective and moderately useful for imaging brain 5-HT1A receptors in vivo. The pyridinyl-6 position is resistant to defluorination and may be an attractive site for the F-18-labeling of 6FPWAY analogs that resist hydrolysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Although the radioligand binding assay with in vitro synthesized S-35-labeled antigen has been used extensively for measuring autoantibodies to IA-2, disadvantages of both assays with respect to synthesis and handling of the radioactive antigen limit their use in routine laboratories. Therefore, we attempted to develop a nonradioactive ELISA for the simple detection of IA-2 autoantibodies. The biotinylated cytoplasmic domain of IA-2 expressed in Escherichia coli was used as an antigen. We evaluated two kinds of ELISA: ELISA with biotin-IA-2 directly captured on streptavidine-coated plates (solid phase) and ELISA with antigen-antibody preincubation in solution in which serum samples were reacted first with biotin-IA-2 and the mixture was transferred to streptavidine-coated plates (liquid phase). We compared their disease sensitivity and specificity with a conventional radioligand binding assay in 52 patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes and 138 normal individuals. The radioligand binding assay had 61.5% sensitivity and 99.3% specificity. The liquid-phase ELISA showed relatively higher sensitivity (55.8%) and specificity (99.3%) than the solid-phase ELISA (sensitivity 53.8% and specificity 97.1%). Furthermore, the mean SD score in IA-2 autoantibody-positive serum samples measured by liquid-phase ELISA was significantly higher than the SD score obtained by solid-phase ELISA (P < 0.0001). We concluded that this liquid-phase ELISA is suitable for detecting IA-2 autoantibodies in patients with type 1 diabetes with a similar sensitivity and specificity to those of conventional radioligand binding assay.

First-in-Humans Brain PET Imaging of the GluN2B-Containing N-methyl-D-aspartate Receptor with (<i>R</i>)-<SUP>11</SUP>C-Me-NB1	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						glutamate; N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA); GluN2B subu-nits; neurodegenerative disease; PET	MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; NMDA RECEPTORS; ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION; REGIONS; DESIGN	The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) plays a crucial role in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease and in the treatment of major depression by fast-acting antidepressants such as ketamine. Given their broad implications, GluN2B-containing NMDARs have been of interest as diagnostic and therapeutic targets. Recently, (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 was investigated preclinically and shown to be a promising radioligand for imaging GluN2B subunits. Here, we report on the performance characteristics of this radioligand in a first-in-humans PET study. Methods: Six healthy male subjects were scanned twice on a fully integrated PET/MR scanner with (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 for 120 min. Brain uptake and tracer distribution over time were investigated by SUVs. Test-retest reliability was assessed with the absolute percentage difference and the coefficient of variation. Exploratory total volumes of distribution (V-T) were computed using an arterial input function and the Logan plot as well as a constrained 2-tissue-compartment model with the ratio of rate constants between plasma and tissue compartments (K-1/k(2)) coupled (2TCM). SUV was correlated with V-T to investigate its potential as a surrogate marker of GluN2B expression. Results: High and heterogeneous radioligand uptake was observed across the entire gray matter with reversible kinetics within the scan time. SUV absolute percentage difference ranged from 6.9% to 8.5% and coefficient of variation from 4.9% to 6.0%, indicating a high test-retest reliability. A moderate correlation was found between SUV averaged from70 to 90 min and V-T using Logan plot (Spearman r = 0.44). Correlation between V-T Logan and 2TCM was r = 0.76. Conclusion: The radioligand (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 was highly effective in mapping GluN2B-enriched NMDARs in the human brain. With a heterogeneous uptake and a high test-retest reliability, this radioligand offers promise to deepen our understanding of the GluN2B-containing NMDAR in the pathophysiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric disease such as Alzheimer disease and major depression. Additionally, it could help in the selection of appropriate doses of GluN2B-targeting drugs.

Synthesis and biodistribution of [<SUP>11</SUP>C] A-836339, a new potential radioligand for PET imaging of cannabinoid type 2 receptors (CB<sub>2</sub>)	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; Alzheimer's disease; Cannabinoid receptor; CB2 receptor; Positron-emission tomography; PET	AMYLOID DEPOSITION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; MOUSE MODEL; EXPRESSION; NEUROINFLAMMATION; INFLAMMATION; PATHOLOGY; DEFICITS; BRAINS	Recently, A-836339 [2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid [3-(2-methoxyethyl)-4,5-dimethyl3H- thiazol-(2Z)-ylidene] amide] (1) was reported to be a selective CB2 agonist with high binding affinity. Here we describe the radiosynthesis of [C-11] A-836339 ([C-11] 1) via its desmethyl precursor as a candidate radioligand for imaging CB2 receptors with positron-emission tomography (PET). Whole body and the regional brain distribution of [C-11] 1 in control CD1 mice demonstrated that this radioligand exhibits specific uptake in the CB2-rich spleen and little specific in vivo binding in the control mouse brain. However, [C-11] 1 shows specific cerebral uptake in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of neuroinflammation and in the brain areas with A beta amyloid plaque deposition in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (APPswe/PS1dE9 mice). These data establish a proof of principle that CB2 receptors binding in the neuroinflammation and related disorders can be measured in vivo. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Inhibitors of FPTase (FTIs) have been developed as potential anticancer agents, and several compounds have been evaluated in clinical trials. To facilitate the identification of cell-active FTIs with high potency, the authors developed a method that uses a radiolabeled FTI that serves as a ligand in competitive displacement assays. Using high-affinity [H-3]-labeled or [I-125] -labeled FTI radioligands, they show that specific binding to FPTase can be detected in intact cells. Binding of these labeled FTI radioligands can be competed with a variety of structurally diverse FTIs, and the authors show that inhibition of FTI radioligand binding correlates well with inhibition of FPTase substrate prenylation in cells. This method provides a rapid and quantitative means of assessing FIR potency in cells and is useful for guiding the discovery of potent, novel inhibitors of FPTase. Similar methods could be employed in the optimization of inhibitors for other intracellular drug targets.

The therapeutic efficacy might be further increased by peptide receptor chemoradionuclide therapy. In this preclinical study, we explored the effects of 5-fluorouracil plus the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor decitabine or the histone deacetylase inhibitor tacedinaline on NET cells in vitro. Methods: Human NET cell lines BON1 and QGP1 were treated with 5-fluorouracil alone or in combination with decitabine or tacedinaline, respectively. Radiosensitivity was tested in combination with.-irradiation at doses of 0, 2, 4, or 6 Gy by colony formation assay. Somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) expression and Ga-68-DOTATOC uptake by human NET cell lines were investigated by Western blot analysis and by a radioligand binding assay. Results: Treatment with 5-fluorouracil alone or in combination with decitabine or tacedinaline reduced tumor cell viability and induced apoptosis, enhanced radiosensitivity in BON1 and QGP1 cells, induced SSTR2 expression, and resulted in increased radioligand binding of Ga-68-DOTATOC in NET cells. Conclusion: This preclinical study demonstrated that 5-fluorouracil alone or in combination with decitabine or tacedinaline caused radiosensitization of tumor cells, upregulation of SSTR2 expression in tumor cells, and increased radioligand binding of Ga-68-DOTATOC to these tumor cells. These preclinical in vitro findings indicate that 5-fluorouracil in combination with epigenetic modifiers might be a putative strategy to improve the treatment efficacy of peptide receptor chemoradionuclide therapy in NET.

Three homologous and two heterologous immunoassay systems for the measurement of progesterone in human serum are described. Using an antiserum raised against progesterone-11 alpha-hemisuccinate-bovine serum albumin (BSA), assays with homologous radioligands, namely progesterone-11 alpha-hemisuccinate-I-125-tyrosine methyl ester (TME) and progesterone-11 alpha-hemisuccinate-I-125-histamine, heterologous bridge radioligand, namely progesterone-11 alpha-hemiphthalate-I-125-TME, and a heterologous site radioligand namely progesterone-3-(O-carboxymethyl) oxime (CMO)-I-125-histamine were optimized. A homologous assay system, using antiserum raised against progesterone-3-carboxymethyl oxime-BSA and progesterone-3-CMO-I-125-histamine as the radioligand was also optimized to develop a radioimmunoassay (RIA) for serum progesterone. Amongst the two homologous radioligands, viz., progesterone-11 alpha-hemisuccinate-I-125-histamine and the corresponding TME conjugate tracer, the former yielded a standard curve with a higher slope (-0.6) as compared to the latter (-0.5). The heterologous bridge system with progesterone-11 alpha-hemiphthalate-I-125-TME resulted in a more sensitive assay (slope of -0.8) than the homologous tracers, whilst the heterologous site radioligand, viz., progesterone-3-CMO-I-125-histamine gave the most sensitive assay (slope of -1.2). The homologous assay with antiserum against progesterone-3-CMO-BSA and progester-one-3-CMO-I-125-histamine tracer gave a standard curve having a slope of -0.97. The two antibodies developed against progesterone, viz., progesterone-11 alpha-hemisuccinateBSA and progesterone-3-CMO-BSA were characterized for their titre, sensitivity.

[C-11]L-703,717 has poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability because it binds tightly to plasma proteins. Co-injection of warfarin (50-200 mg/kg), a drug that binds to albumin and resembles L-703,717 in structure, dose-dependently enhanced the penetration by [C-11]L-703,717 in mice, resulting in a five-fold increase in the brain radioactivity at 1 min after the injection. Drugs structurally unrelated to L-703,717, salicylate, phenol red, and L-tryptophan, were less effective or ineffective in increasing the uptake of [C-11]L-703,717. These results suggest that the simultaneous use of a drug that inhibits the binding of a radioligand to plasma proteins is a useful way to overcome the poor BBB permeability of the radioligand triggered by its right binding to plasma proteins. In brain distribution studies in rodents, it was found that, after the increase in brain uptake with warfarin, much of the glycine site antagonist accumulates in the cerebellum but its pharmacological specificity did not match the glycine site of NMDA receptors.

However, there are several restrictions in using a radioisotope of C-11 and requires for more effective radioisotopes and ligands. In order to produce a structure most similar to WAY-100635, WAY-100635 derivatives containing a cysteine chelator were designed and confirmed by using in silico (Hyperchem). The novel compounds (7a, 7b, 7c) were prepared in five or 7 steps with yields of 16%, 36% and 42%, respectively and radiolabeled with [Tc-99m(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+). The labeling yield was 99% for all the newly synthesized compounds. [Tc-99m(CO)(3)]-WAY-100635 derivatives show a neutral charge which were confirmed by paper electrophoresis.

In most cases, quantification of 2-[F-18]FA receptor binding involves measurement of free nonmetabolized radioligand concentration in blood. This requires an efficient and reliable method to separate radioactive metabolites from the parent compound. In the present study, three analytical methods, thin layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and solid phase extraction (SPE) have been tested. Reversed-phase TLC of deproteinized aqueous samples of plasma provides good estimates of 2-[F-18]FA and its metabolites. However, because of the decreased radioactivity in plasma samples, this method can be used in humans over the first 2 h after radioligand injection only. Reliable quantification of the parent radioligand and its main metabolites was obtained using reversed-phase HPLC, followed by counting of eluted fractions in a well gamma counter. Three main and five minor metabolites of 2-[F-18]FA were detected in human blood using this method. On average, the unchanged 2-[F-18]FA fraction in plasma of healthy volunteers measured at 14, 60, 120, 240 and 420 min after radioligand injection was 87.3 +/- 2.2%, 74.4 +/- 3%, 68.8 +/- 5%, 62.3 +/- 8% and 61.0 +/- 8%,. respectively. In patients with neurodegenerative disorders, the values corresponding to the three last time points were significantly lower. The fraction of nonmetabolized 2-[F-18]FA in plasma determined using SPE did not differ significantly from that obtained by HPLC (+gamma counting) (n=73, r=.95). Since SPE is less time-consuming than HPLC and provides comparable results, we conclude that SPE appears to be the most suitable method for measurement of 2-[F-18]FA parent fraction during PET investigations.

Traditional methods for measuring affinity involve radiolabeled ligands. To address the need for homogeneous biochemical fluorescent assays to characterize orthosteric ligand affinity and dissociation rates, we have developed a fluorescence anisotropy (FA) assay for the muscarinic M1 receptor that can be conducted in a 384-well plate. We used membranes from a muscarinic M1 cell line optimized for high-throughput functional assays and the previously characterized fluorescent antagonist BODIPY (R) FL pirenzepine. The affinities of reference compounds were determined in the competitive FA assay and compared with those obtained with a competitive filter-based radioligand-binding assay using [(3)H] N-methylscopolamine. The IC(50) values produced from the FA assay were well-correlated with the radioligand-binding K(i) values (R(2) = 0.98). The dissociation of the BODIPY FL pirenzepine was readily monitored in real time using the FA assay and was sensitive to the presence of the allosteric modulator gallamine. This M1 FA assay offers advantages over traditional radioligand-binding assays as it eliminates radioactivity while allowing investigation of orthosteric or allosteric muscarinic M1 ligands in a homogeneous format	[Huwiler, Kristin G.; Hanson, Bonnie; Vogel, Kurt W.] Life Technol, Madison, WI 53719 USA; [De Rosier, Therese] Life Technol, Brown Deer, WI USA	Thermo Fisher Scientific; Thermo Fisher Scientific	Huwiler, KG (corresponding author), Life Technol, 501 Charmany Dr, Madison, WI 53719 USA.	kristin.huwiler@lifetech.com							36	16	16	0	12	MARY ANN LIEBERT INC	NEW ROCHELLE	140 HUGUENOT STREET, 3RD FL, NEW ROCHELLE, NY 10801 USA	1540-658X			ASSAY DRUG DEV TECHN	ASSAY DRUG DEV.

Phenserine administration 30 minutes before resulted in a dose-dependent increase in N-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)-4-piperidyl benzilate binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors. reaching a maximum increase of 90% in the striatum at a dose of 5 mg/kg intraperitoneally. Constant infusion of physostigmine at a dosage of 250 mug/kg/min produced an identical increase in radioligand binding. This agonist-induced increase of in vivo mAChR radioligand binding offers a new method for monitoring of the efficacy of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors or other drugs to enhance acetylcholine actions at the muscarinic receptors.

This study used PET to quantitatively and separately measure the signal from transfected receptors, endogenous receptors/targets, and non-displaceable binding in other brain regions to better understand this superiority. A genetically-modified muscarinic type-4 human receptor (hM(4)Di) was injected into the right amygdala of a male rhesus macaque. [C-11]DCZ and [C-11]CLZ PET scans were conducted 2-24 months later. Uptake was quantified relative to the concentration of parent radioligand in arterial plasma at baseline (n = 3 scans/radioligand) and after receptor blockade (n = 3 scans/radioligand). Both radioligands had greater uptake in the transfected region and displaceable uptake in other brain regions. Displaceable uptake was not uniformly distributed, perhaps representing off-target binding to endogenous receptor(s). After correction, [C-11]DCZ signal was 19% of that for [C-11]CLZ, and background uptake was 10% of that for [C-11]CLZ. Despite stronger [C-11]CLZ binding, the signal-to-background ratio for [C-11]DCZ was almost two-fold greater than for [C-11]CLZ. Both radioligands had comparable DREADD selectivity. All reference tissue models underestimated signal-to-background ratio in the transfected region by 40%-50% for both radioligands. Thus, the greater signal-to-background ratio of [C-11]DCZ was due to its lower background uptake.

HS665 was prepared in tritium-labeled form by a dehalotritiated method resulting in a specific activity of 30.65 Ci/mmol. Radioligand binding studies were performed to establish binding properties of [H-3]HS665 to the recombinant human KOP receptor in membranes from Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human KOP receptors (CHOhKOP) and to the native neuronal KOP receptor in guinea pig brain membranes. Binding of [H-3]HS665 was specific and saturable in both tissue preparations. A single population of high affinity binding sites was labeled by [H-3]HS665 in membranes from CHOhKOP cells and guinea pig brain with similar equilibrium dissociation constants, K-d, 0.45 and 0.64 nM, respectively. Average receptor density of [H-3]HS665 recognition sites were 5564 and 154 fmol/mg protein in CHOhKOP cells and guinea pig brain, respectively. This study shows that the new radioligand distinguishes and labels KOP receptors specifically in neuronal and cellular systems expressing KOP receptors, making this molecule a valuable tool in probing structural and functional mechanisms governing ligand-KOP receptor interactions in both a recombinant and native in vitro setting.

Neuroendocrine Differentiation and Response to PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in Advanced Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Single-Center Retrospective Study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neuroendocrine differentiation; chromogranin A; prostate-specific membrane antigen; PSMA; PSMA-617; radioligand therapy	CHROMOGRANIN-A	Neuroendocrine differentiation is associated with treatment failure and poor outcome in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We investigated the effect of circulating neuroendocrine biomarkers on the efficacy of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT). Methods: Neuroendocrine biomarker profiles (progastrin-releasing peptide, neuronspecific enolase, and chromogranin-A) were analyzed in 50 patients commencing Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT. The primary endpoint was a prostate-specific antigen response in relation to baseline neuroendocrine marker profiles. An additional endpoint was progression-free survival. Tumor uptake on posttherapeutic scans, a known predictive marker for response, was used as a control variable. Results: Neuroendocrine biomarker profiles were abnormal in most patients. Neuroendocrine biomarker levels did not predict treatment failure or early progression (P >= 0.13). By contrast, intense PSMA-ligand uptake in metastases predicted both treatment response (P = 0.0030) and reduced risk of early progression (P = 0.0111). Conclusion: Neuroendocrine marker profiles do not predict an adverse outcome from RLT. By contrast, high ligand uptake was confirmed to be crucial for achieving a tumor response.

Radioligand binding assays are typically not available for allosteric binding sites. We synthesized, purified, and applied the first tritium-labeled allosteric modulator of the human chemokine receptor CXCR3 (RAMX3, [3H]N-{1-[3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl]ethyl}-2-[4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-N-[(1-methylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl]acetamide). RAMX3 is chemically derived from 8-azaquinazolinone-type allosteric modulators and binds to the CXCR3 receptor with a Kd value of 1.08 nM (specific activity: 80.4 Ci?mmol-1). Radioligand displacement assays showed potent negative cooperativity between RAMX3 and chemokine CXCL11, providing a basis for the use of RAMX3 to investigate other potential allosteric modulators. Additionally, the synthesis and characterization of a number of other full and truncated 8-azaquinazoline analogues were used to validate the binding properties of RAMX3. We demonstrate that RAMX3 can be efficiently used to facilitate the discovery and characterization of small molecules as allosteric modulators of the CXCR3 receptor.

Here, we have used an iodinated derivative of flg22 (I-125-labeled Tyr-flg22) as a molecular probe for the flagellin receptor in tomato cells. This radioligand showed rapid binding to a single class of specific, saturable, high-affinity receptor sites in intact cells and membrane preparations. Binding, although essentially nonreversible under physiological conditions, was not covalent, and chemical cross-linking was required to specifically label a single polypeptide of 115 kD. Intact flagellin and elicitor-active flagellin peptides but not biologically inactive analogs efficiently competed for binding of radioligand. Peptides lacking the C terminus of the conserved domain, previously found to act as competitive antagonists of elicitor action in tomato cells, also competed for binding of radioligand. Thus, this novel, high-affinity binding site exhibited all the characteristics expected of a functional receptor of bacterial flagellin. For a model of receptor activation, we propose a two-step mechanism according to the address-message concept, in which binding of the N terminus (address) is the first step and activation of responses with the C terminus (message) is the second step.

Recently theranostic concepts using radiolabeled ligands of the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been developed for diagnostics and therapy of patients with advanced mCRPC. The aim of this study was to evaluate tumor response, adverse effects, and survival in patients undergoing radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617. Methods: Fifty therapies using Lu-177-PSMA-617 were performed in 28 consecutive patients with mCRPC and exhausted conventional therapeutic options (median age, 73.4 years; range, 45-87 years). Data were retrospectively analyzed with focus on response, safety, and survival. The median overall survival was compared with that of a recent historical patient cohort treated with best supportive care prior to availability of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Results: Any PSA decline occurred in 59% and 75% of patients after 1 and 2 therapies. Moreover, a PSA decline of 50% or greater occurred in 32% and 50%. Therapies were well tolerated. Hematologic and renal parameters changed insignificantly; permanent xerostomia or other safetyrelated toxicity did not occur. The estimated median survival was 29.4 weeks, significantly longer than survival in the historical best supportive care group (19.7 weeks [hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval, 0.20-0.95]; P = 0.031). Conclusions: Results from 50 therapies show that radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 is effective and well tolerated and seems to increase overall survival. A future randomized controlled prospective study will be necessary to confirm these results.

We recently developed the F-18-labelled molecule 2-[5-(4-[F-18] fluoropropyloxyphenyl)-2-oxo-1,3-benzoxazol-3(2H)-yl]-N-methyl-N-phenylacetamide ([F-18] FPBMP) as a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging TSPO. In this study, we have evaluated the pharmacokinetics of this radioligand based on its biodistribution in mice, as well as the results of PET and metabolite studies in rats. The specificity of [F-18] FPBMP towards TSPO was assessed by blocking experiments involving the intravenous injection of 1 mg kg(-1) of unlabeled PK11195. A metabolite study was performed in the plasma and peripheral organs of rats by HPLC methods. The ex vivo biodistribution of [F-18] FPBMP in mice showed a high uptake of radioactivity in TSPO enriched peripheral organs, especially in the lung, heart and kidney. The in vivo biodistribution of this compound was evaluated through PET summation images of rats 1-10, 10-20, 20-30 and 50-60 min after the injection of the radioligand. The TSPO-enriched organs, including the heart, kidney and lung, were clearly visualized. Pre-treatment with TSPO-specific PK11195 minimized the uptake of [F-18] FPBMP in the TSPO-enriched tissues, thereby confirming its selectivity for TSPO. Metabolite analysis in rats confirmed the presence of [F-18] FPBMP in the heart, lung and kidney up to 60 min. In summary, these data demonstrate that [F-18] FPBMP is a suitable PET ligand for the imaging of TSPO in peripheral tissues.

Besides evaluation of several radiosynthesis procedures, we performed an extensive HPLC study for quantitative separation of [F-18]NS10743 from the corresponding nitro precursor. After implementation of the optimized procedure on a TRACERlab (TM) FX F-N synthesis module, [F-18]NS10743 was obtained in high radiochemical purity ( >= 99%) with an overall radiochemical yield of 32.2 +/- 7% (n=3).

In the present study, we prepared [11 C]l by O-alkylation of the phenolic precursor 2 with [C-11]CH3I. [C-11]1 was obtained in a 29% non-decay corrected yield and specific activity of 9299 mCi/mu mol calculated at end-of-synthesis. The biodistribution of [C-11]1 in mouse brain demonstrated rapid and homogenous concentration in all brain structures, which included the cortex, thalamus, cerebellum and striatum. Co-administration of unlabelled 1 (1 mg/kg) or the sigma-2 selective ligand SM-21 (1 mg/kg) failed to show any significant inhibition of [C-11]1 uptake in the mouse brain.

PARP is of central importance in cell homeostasis, neuroplasticity, and neurodegeneration in the brain. A radiolabeled PARP inhibitor was developed and used for autoradiographic quantification of PARP protein concentration in wild-type and transgenic rodent brains ex vivo in high resolution. The binding of [H-3]rucaparib was found to be confined to PARP-expressing domains, for example, cerebellar cortex or hippocampal regions in both models. Saturation binding experiments confirmed selective and reversible binding to a single site (K-d = 1.1 +/- 0.2 nM).

Herein, we report the first preclinical evaluation of [H-3]CPPC using radioligand binding methods for the evaluation of putative CSF-1R inhibitors in rodent models of neuroinflammation. The distribution of [H-3]CPPC by auto-radiography did not align with 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) distribution using [H-3]PBR28 and IBA-1 staining for microglia. In the CNS, [H-3]CPPC had considerable nonspecific binding, as indicated by a low displacement of the tritiated ligand by unlabeled CPPC and the known CSF1R inhibitors BLZ-945 and PLX3397. Spleen was identified as a tissue that provided an adequate signal-to-noise ratio to enable screening with [H-3]CPPC and a library of 20 novel PLX3397 derivatives. However, unlabeled CPPC lacked selectivity and showed off-target binding to a substantial number of kinase targets (204 out of 403 tested) at a concentration relevant to in vitro radioligand binding assays (10 mu M). These findings suggest that, while [H-3]CPPC may have utility as a radioligand tool for the evaluation of peripheral targets and screening of CSF-1R inhibitors, it may have limited utility as an in vivo CNS imaging probe on the basis of the current evaluation.

However, when analysed individually a number of small, yet significant differences were observed with some of the compounds. 4 These data are consistent with previous study that suggested a possible pharmacological difference between these isoforms, at least in terms of the CCK2-receptor antagonist, L-365,260. However, it would appear that the pharmacological profile of these compounds is not consistent with their affinity at the putative G(1)/G(2) receptors previously described by Harper et al.

The decay-corrected radiochemical yield was 25-30% and the effective specific activity was 4153 GBq/mu mol. Tissue distribution studies of 2-[F-18]fluoro-CP-118,954 ([F-18]1) in mice showed that the regional brain distribution correlated well with the known density of AChE in the mouse brain. A high level of uptake in the striatum was also shown at all time points in the olfactory tubercle, which is known to have dopaminergic neurons. Blocking studies showed that radioligand uptake in all brain regions was not altered by either the dopamine receptor antagonists or the sigma receptor agonist. On the other hand, radioligand uptake in both the striatum and the olfactory tubercle was significantly blocked (80%) by ligand 1. The low level of bone uptake over time suggested that [F-18]1 underwent little in vivo metabolic defluorination. The lack of metabolite formation in the mouse brain indicated that the regional distribution was attributed to [F-18]1. These results demonstrated that [F-18]1 binds specifically and selectively to AChE in mice and appears to be a suitable radioligand for the in vivo mapping of AChE. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Despite a common origin, their clinical symptoms and outcomes are varied. They are most commonly localized in the gastrointestinal tract. Targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) is a treatment option which has proven to be successful in recent studies. However, the possible outcomes and true safety profile of the treatment need to be fully determined, especially by new, more sensitive methods. Our study aimed to present an extended analysis of acute and chronic renal complications during and after radioligand therapy using, for the first time in the literature, innovative and complex renal parameters. Forty patients with neuroendocrine tumors underwent four courses of radioligand therapy with [Lu-177]Lu-DOTATATE or [Lu-177]Lu/[Y-90]Y-DOTATATE. Radioisotopes were administrated in intervals of 8-12 weeks, with concurrent intravenous nephroprotection. New detailed and sensitive renal parameters were used to determine the renal safety profile during and after radioisotope therapy for standard treatment of NEN. During the first and fourth courses of RLT, no change in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was observed. However, long-term observations one year after the treatment showed a 10% reduction in the GFR. During the first course of treatment, the fractional urea and calcium excretions increased, while the fractional potassium concentration decreased. The fractional calcium excretion remained highly increased in long-term observations. Decreases in urine IL-18, KIM-1 and albumin concentrations were observed during RLT. The concentrations of IL-18 and KIM-1 remained low even a year after therapy. The ultrasound parameters of renal perfusion changed during treatment, before partially returning to the baseline one year after therapy, and were correlated with the biochemical parameters of renal function. A permanent increase in diastolic blood pressure was correlated with the decrease in the GFR observed during the study. In this innovative and complex renal assessment during and after RLT, we found a permanent 10% per year decrease in the GFR and noticeable disturbances in renal tubule function. The diastolic blood pressure also increased.

Characterization of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]LUF5834: A novel non-ribose high-affinity agonist radioligand for the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adenosine receptor; G protein-coupled receptor; Radioligand; Partial agonist; Inverse agonist	SEROTONIN 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; RECOMBINANT HUMAN; G-PROTEIN; INVERSE AGONISTS; WILD-TYPE; BINDING; LIGANDS; PROFILE; ANTAGONISTS	The adenosine A(1) receptor is a promising therapeutic target for neurological disorders such as cognition deficits and is involved in cardiovascular preconditioning. Classically adenosine receptor agonists were all derivatives of adenosine, and thought to require a D-ribose moiety. More recently, however, the discovery of non-adenosine agonists for the human adenosine A(1) receptor (hA(1)R) has challenged this dogma (Beukers et al., 2004). In this study we characterize the tritiated form of one of these compounds, [H-3]LUF5834, as the first non-ribose partial agonist radioligand with nanomolar affinity for the hA(1)R. Due to its partial agonist efficacy, [H-3]LUF5834 labeled both G protein-coupled and uncoupled receptors with a similar high affinity. Using [H-3]LUF5834 we performed competition binding experiments to characterize a range of A(1)R ligands varying in efficacy from the full agonist CPA to the inverse agonist DPCPX. Surprisingly, in the control condition both agonists and inverse agonists displayed biphasic isotherms. With the addition of 1 mM GTP the high affinity isotherm of agonists or the low affinity isotherm of inverse agonists was lost revealing the mechanism of action of such inverse agonists at the AIR. Consequently, [H-3]LUF5834 represents a novel high affinity radioligand for the A(1)R and may prove a useful tool to provide estimates of inverse agonist efficacy at this receptor.

After verifying the stability of the radiotracer [I-125]IBT, the biodistribution in vivo and regional brain biodistribution studies were carried out in mice. Blocking studies with methyllycaconitine citrate and nicotine were carried out under control and blocking conditions, and the metabolic stability was assessed in vivo in the plasma, brain, and liver.Results and conclusionThe results of our study suggested that [I-125]IBT had affinity for 7-nAChRs. The in-vivo evaluation in mice of [I-125]IBT showed a high brain/blood ratio and excellent metabolic stability. The regional brain distribution studies and the blocking studies showed that it had favorable selectivity and specificity and was a potential 7-nAChRs radioligand.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a potential high-affinity PET radioligand for the beta(1)-subtype of ARs. Here, the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of (S)- and (R)-N-[2-[3-(2-cyano-phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-propylamino]-ethyl-N'-[4-(2-fluoro-ethoxy)-phenyl]-urea (8a-b), derivatives of the well-characterized beta(1)-AR selective antagonist, ICI 89,406, are described. The (S)-isomer 8a shows both higher beta(1)-AR selectivity and beta(1)-AR affinity than the (R)-enantiomer 8b (selectivity: 40800 vs 1580; affinity: K-11 = 0.049 nM vs K-11 = 0.297 nM). Therefore, the F-18-labelled analogue 8e of compound 8a was synthesized. While the direct nucleophilic F-18-fluorination of the tosylate precursor 8d produced 8e in low radiochemical yields (<= 2.9% decay-corrected) and specific activities (<= 3.5 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis (EOS), n = 9) the alternative two-step synthesis of 8e from ethylene glycol di-p-tosylate 9, [F-18]fluoride ion and phenol precursor 8f gave satisfying results (16.4 +/- 3.2% radiochemical yield (decay-corrected), 99.7 +/- 0.5% radiochemical purity, 40 +/- 8 GBq/mu mol specific activity at the EOS within 174 +/- 3 min from the end of bombardment (EOB) (n = 5)).

The molecular basis for these actions is not fully elucidated, but lithocholyltaurine interacts functionally with muscarinic receptors on gastric chief cells. In the present report, we demonstrate selective interaction of bile acids with Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing each of the five muscarinic receptors. Lithocholyltaurine decreases binding of a radioligand to muscarinic M3 receptors, but not to other muscarinic receptors. Sulfated lithocholyltaurine, the major human metabolite, inhibits radioligand binding to muscarinic M1, but not to M2 or M3 receptors. Post-receptor actions of lithocholyltaurine include modulation of acetylcholine-induced increases in inositol phosphate formation and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation. Molecular modeling suggests that the specific and functional interaction of lithocholyltaurine with muscarinic receptors is most likely due to similar shape and surface charge distribution of portions of acetylcholine and the bile acid. We propose that bile acids are signaling molecules whose effects may be mediated by interaction with muscarinic receptors. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Single-Step High-Yield Radiosynthesis and Evaluation of a Sensitive, <SUP>18</SUP>F-Labeled Ligand for Imaging Brain Peripheral Benzodiazepine Receptors with PET	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PROTEIN 18 KDA; BINDING-SITES; IN-VIVO; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; NEURONAL DAMAGE; RADIOLIGAND; CELLS; BIOSYNTHESIS	Elevated levels of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) are associated with activated microglia in their response to inflammation. Hence, PBR imaging in vivo is valuable for investigating brain inflammatory conditions. Sensitive, easily prepared, and readily available radioligands for imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) are desirable for this purpose. We describe a new F-18-labeled PBR radioligand, namely [F-18]N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline ([F-18]9). [F-18]9 was produced easily through a single and highly efficient step, the reaction of [F-18]fluoride ion with the corresponding bromo precursor, 8. Ligand 9 exhibited high affinity for PBR in vitro. PET showed that [F-18]9 was avidly taken into monkey brain and gave a high ratio of PBR-specific to nonspecific binding. [F-18]9 was devoid of defluorination in rat and monkey and gave predominantly polar radiometabolite(s). In rat, a low level radiometabolite of intermediate lipophilicity was identified as [F-18]2-fluoro-N-(2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([F-18]11). [F-18]9 is a promising radioligand for future imaging of PBR in living human brain.	[Briard, Emmanuelle; Zoghbi, Sami S.; Simeon, Fabrice G.; Imaizumi, Masao; Gourley, Jonathan P.; Shetty, H.

The inhibitory activity for PDE5 together with a panel of other PDEs was determined in vitro and two derivatives were selected for IC50 value determination. The most promising compound 7 (IC50 = 5.92 nM for PDE5A), containing a 3-fluoroazetidine moiety, was further radiolabeled by aliphatic nucleophilic substitution of two different leaving groups (nosylate and tosylate) using [F-18] fluoride. The use of the nosylate precursor and tetra-n-butyl ammonium [F-18] fluoride ([F-18] TBAF) in 3-methyl-3-pentanol combined with the addition of a small amount of water proved to be the best radiolabeling conditions achieving a RCY of 4.9 +/- 1.5% in an automated procedure. Preliminary biological investigations in vitro and in vivo were performed to characterize this new PDE5 radioligand. Metabolism studies of [F-18] 7 in mice revealed a fast metabolic degradation with the formation of radiometabolites which have been detected in the brain.

While PDE10A is primarily expressed in the medium spiny neurons of the striatum, it has been implicated in a variety of neurological disorders. Indeed, inhibition of PDE10A has proven to be of potential use for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) pathologies caused by dysfunction of the basal ganglia-of which the striatum constitutes the largest component. A PDE10A-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand would enable a better assessment of the pathophysiologic role of PDE10A, as well as confirm the relationship between target occupancy and administrated dose of a given drug candidate, thus accelerating the development of effective PDE10A inhibitors. In this study, we designed and synthesized a novel 18F-aryl PDE10A PET radioligand, codenamed [18F]P10A-1910 ([18F]9), in high radiochemical yield and molar ac-tivity via spirocyclic iodonium ylide-mediated radiofluorination. [18F]9 possessed good in vitro binding af-finity (IC50 = 2.1 nmol/L) and selectivity towards PDE10A. Further, [18F]9 exhibited reasonable lipophilicity (logD = 3.50) and brain permeability (Papp > 10 x 10-6 cm/s in MDCK-MDR1 cells). PET imaging studies of [18F]9 revealed high striatal uptake and excellent in vivo specificity with reversible tracer kinetics. Preclinical studies in rodents revealed an improved plasma and brain stability of [18F]9 when compared to the current reference standard for PDE10A-targeted PET, [18F]MNI659. Further, dose-response experiments with a series of escalating doses of PDE10A inhibitor 1 in rhesus monkey brains confirmed the utility of [18F]9 for evaluating target occupancy in vivo in higher species. In conclusion, our results indicated that [18F]9 is a promising PDE10A PET radioligand for clinical translation. 2022 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sci-ences.

Relative binding affinities (RBAs) were obtained by the competition method, using [H-3]-estradiol as the radioligand. Mixtures of environmental estrogens behaved additively in the assay, and in an interspecies comparison, the order of affinity was similar in rat liver and trout liver. Similar RBAs in different species are supported by sequence alignment analysis, which indicates conservation of key amino acid residues and sequences in the ligand binding domains of estrogen receptors of diverse species. The results are discussed in the context of the requirement for screening assays for endocrine modulators.

First D<sub>1</sub>-like receptor PET imaging of the rat and primate kidney: implications for human disease monitoring	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						renal PET; renal dopamine; dopamine; hypertension; positron emission tomography	DOPAMINE-RECEPTOR; HYPERTENSION; RADIOLIGAND; BINDING	The intrarenal dopamine system is important for signaling and natriuresis, and significant dysfunction is associated with hypertension and kidney disease in ex vivo studies. Dopamine receptors also modulate and are modulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Here, we show the first in vivo measurement of D-1-like receptors in the renal cortex of Sprague-Dawley rat and Papio anubis baboon using [C-11]NNC 112, a positron emission tomography radioligand for D-1-like receptors. In addition, we show a D-1-like binding potential response to angiotensin II blockade in rats using losartan. Demonstration of self-saturable binding in the rat as well as specific and saturable binding in Papio anubis validate the use of [C-11]NNC 112 in the first in vivo measurement of renal dopamine D-1-like receptors. Furthermore, [C-11]NNC 112 is a radioligand tool already validated for use in probing human central nervous system (CNS) D-1-like receptors. Our work demonstrates specific and saturable non-CNS binding in higher animals and the ability to quantify physiological response to drug treatment and provides a clear path to extend use of [C-11]NNC 112 to study renal dopamine in humans.

Yet, given the mode of action of PSMA-RLT, it is postulated that in early disease prostate cancer settings, e.g. hormone-sensitive, can also benefit from this treatment. In this retrospective study, the safety and efficacy was investigated of two PSMA-RLT schemes: monotherapy with 177Lu-PSMA and 177Lu-PSMA in combination with 225Ac-PSMA in twenty patients with early stage metastatic prostate cancer. The treatment appeared safe with limited and mainly transient side effects, also on a longer term follow-up, with encouraging efficacy for twenty early-stage metastatic prostate cancer. Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed radioligand therapy (RLT) is a novel treatment for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Given the mode of action, patients in an earlier disease stage, such as hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (HSPC), are also likely to benefit from [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA- (Lu-177-PSMA) or [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-radioligand treatment (Ac-225-PSMA). In this retrospective study, we analyzed the safety and efficacy of PSMA-RLT in early-stage and hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer patients. Methods: A retrospective study was performed in patients who received Lu-177-PSMA and/or Ac-225-PSMA with early-stage metastatic prostate cancer. The primary outcome parameter evaluated in this study was the progression-free survival (PFS) after PSMA-RLT and toxicity according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Secondary outcome parameters were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and the date of onset of CRPC state. Results: In total, 20 patients were included of which 18 patients received Lu-177-PSMA radioligand and two patients received tandem treatment with both Lu-177-PSMA and Ac-225-PSMA radioligands. Patients received a median of 2 treatment cycles (range 1-6) and a median activity of 6.2 GBq Lu-177-PSMA per cycle (interquartile range (IQR) 5.2-7.4 GBq). PSMA-RLT was overall well-tolerated. The most common grade 1-2 side effects were xerostomia (n = 6) and fatigue (n = 8), which were only temporarily reported. One patient that received Ac-225-PSMA developed grade 3-4 bone marrow toxicity. The median PFS was 12 months (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.09-19.9 months). Seventeen (85%) patients had a >= 50% PSA response following PSMA-RLT. One patient developed CRPC 9 months following PSMA-RLT. Conclusions: In this small cohort study, PSMA-RLT appeared safe and showed encouraging efficacy for (metastasized) early-stage and hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients. Prospective studies are awaited and should include long-term follow-up.	[Banda, Amina; Prive, Bastiaan M.; Allach, Youssra; Uijen, Maike J. M.; Peters, Steffie M.

TSPO imaging is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of neuroinflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for [F-18]FEDAA1106 based on human whole-body PET measurements. Methods PET scans were performed for a total of 6.6 h after the injection of 183.8 +/- 9.1 MBq of [F-18]FEDAA1106 in six healthy subjects. Regions of interest were drawn on coronal images. Estimates of the absorbed doses of radiation were calculated using the OLINDA software. Results Peak uptake was largest in lungs, followed by liver, small intestine, kidney, spleen and other organs. Peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lungs (27.1%ID at 0.2 h), liver (21.1%ID at 0.6 h), small intestine (10.4%ID at 6.3 h), kidney (4.9%ID at 1.8 h) and spleen (4.6%ID at 0.6 h). The largest absorbed dose was found in the spleen (0.12 mSv/MBq), followed by kidneys (0.094 mSv/MBq). The calculated mean effective dose was 0.036 mSv/MBq. Conclusion Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the estimated radiation burden of [F-18]FEDAA1106 is moderately higher than that of [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In clinical studies, the administered activity of this radioligand ought to be adjusted in line with regional regulations. This result would be helpful for further clinical TSPO imaging studies.

The biodistributions of both compounds were comparable with that obtained in an earlier study using tritiated RS-79938-197 and were consistent with the known localisation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. The maxi mal signals (total to non-specific binding) were, however, reduced, in the order [C-11]RS-7994X-197 < [C-11]RS-15385-197 < [H-3]RS-79938-197, primarily due to the difference in radiolabel position (O-methyl for carbon-11] compared with S-ethyl for tritium), This resulted in the in-growth of radiolabelled metabolites in plasma, which, in turn, contributed to the non-specific component of brain radioactivity. Nonetheless, the signal ratio of similar to 5 for a receptor-dense tissue compared with the receptor-sparse cerebellum, at 90-120 min after radioligand injection, encouraged the development, of [O-methyl-C-11]RS-15385-197 fur human positron emission tomography (PET), Unfortunately, in two human PET scans teach of 90 min), brain extraction of the radioligand was minimal, with volumes of distribution more than an order of magnitude lower than that measured in rats. Following intravenous injection, radioactivity was retained in plasma and metabolism of the radiolabelled compound was very low. Retrospective measurements of in vitro plasma protein binding and in vivo brain uptake index (BUI) in rats demonstrated a higher protein binding of the radioligand in human compared with rat plasma and a lower BUI in the presence of human plasma. It is feasible that a higher affinity of RS-15385-197 for human plasma protein compared with receptor limited the transport of the radioligand, Although one of the PET scans showed a slight heterogeneity in biodistribution of radioactivity which was consistent with the known localisation of alpha(2)-adretloceptors in human brain, it was concluded that [O-methyl-C-11]RS- 15385-197 showed little promise for routine quantification of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in man.

The neutral complex combines an N2S2 diamine dithiol (DADT) ligand as complexing moiety for oxotechnetium(V) and a 2-(1-piperazino)phenol via a 6-carbon alkyl chain, derived from desmethyl-WAY 100635 (DWAY). The complex displays an IC50 value for the 5-HT1A receptor of 1.29 nM against the selective 5-HT1A agonist [H-3]8-OH-DPAT, a moderate selectivity towards the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (IC50 of 8.1 nM against [H-3]prazosin) and a good selectivity for the D-2 receptor (IC50 of 192 nM against [H-3]spiperone) and the 5-HT2A receptor (IC50 of 922 nM against [H-3]ketanserin). Biodistribution studies in rats show an initial brain uptake of 0.56%+/-0.07% ID 2.5 min p.i. In vitro autoradiographic studies of the Tc-99m complex in rat brains indicate a strong specific accumulation of the radioactivity in 5-HT1A receptor-rich brain regions.

Novel compounds were evaluated for affinity and selectivity in competitive radioligand binding assays selective for cerebral serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE) transporters (SERT, DAT, and NET). The nortropane-fluoroalkyl esters (7, 10, 11) were most potent for SERT (K-i: 0.18, 0.24, and 0.30 nM, respectively). Tosylate esters 17 and 18, synthesized as precursors for [F-18]-labeled, Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agents, also showed high affinity for DAT. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we demonstrate an example for the study of (11)C-labeled 1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-4-(3-phenylprophyl) piperazine ((11)C-SA4503) for mapping sigma(1) receptors in the human brain. Five healthy male subjects underwent two successive PET scans with (15)O-H(2)O to measure the rCBF and with (11)C-SA4503 (dynamic 60-min scan). The brain kinetics of (11)C-SA4503 was evaluated using the time-activity curve (TAC) of tissue in each of the 11 regions of the brain and the metabolite-corrected TAC of plasma on the basis of a two-tissue compartment fourparameter model. The estimated parameters were four rate constants: K (1), influx from plasma to brain tissue; k (2), efflux from tissue to plasma; k (3), association between tracer and receptors; and k (4), dissociation of tracer-receptor complex, and the binding potential (BP), k (3)/k (4). (11)CSA4503 was distributed all over the brain, and the TACs exhibited an accumulation pattern in all the 11 regions. K (1) of (11)C-SA4503 correlated with rCBF, but the other three rate constant parameters and BP did not. The regional difference in the BP of (11)C-SA4503 is compatible with those of sigma(1) receptors. In conclusion, successive PET measurements of rCBF and the brain kinetics of radioligand-neuroreceptor binding are useful for the first clinical trial of a newly developed radioligand for mapping neuroreceptors, and the protocol is applicable to pathophysiological studies of brain disorders.

A full-length cDNA encoding mGluR1a, which was isolated from a lambda 11 cDNA library of human cerebellar origin, was expressed in a baculovirus/Sf9 insect cell system. Membrane fractions with recombinant receptor expression were analyzed for the binding of [H-3]L-quisqualic acid (L-QA), which is known to be a potent agonist of mGluR1a. Efficient binding of the radioligand to the human receptor was observed in a saturable manner, giving an apparent Kd= 0.091 muM. [H-3]L-QA bound to the human mGluR1a was displaced by known ligands such as L-QA, L-Glu, t-ACPD (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane -trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid) with IC(50)s = 0.056, 0.97 and 4.0 muM, respectively. MCPG (alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine) displaced the radioligand binding with lower potency. Using this binding protocol, we then evaluated the ligand ability of synthetic dipeptides. Among peptides tested, only Glu-containing dipeptides inhibited the radioligand binding, e.g. IC50 of L-Met-L-Glu was 4.3 muM. When phosphatidyl inositol turnover was assayed in mGluR1a-expressing CHO cells, L-Met-L-Glu was partially agonistic. We further expanded this [H-3]L-OA binding protocol to type 5a mGluR, another member of group I mGluRs, as well as to AMPA receptor, a member of ionotropic glutamate receptors, since L-QA is also known to be a potent ligand for these receptors. Data shown here will provide a novel system not only to search for ligands for the glutamate receptors, but also to biochemically analyze the interaction modes between glutamate receptors and their ligands.

An imaging-based method to quantify early treatment responses can help to understand and optimize RLT. Methods We developed a self-triggered probe 2 targeting the colocalization of PSMA and caspase-3 for fluorescence imaging of RLT-induced apoptosis. Results The probe binds to PSMA potently with a K-i of 4.12 nM, and its fluorescence can be effectively switched on by caspase-3 with a K-m of 67.62 mu M. Cellular and in vivo studies demonstrated its specificity for imaging radiation-induced caspase-3 upregulation in prostate cancer. To identify the detection limit of our method, we showed that probe 2 could achieve 1.79 times fluorescence enhancement in response to Lu-177-RLT in a medium PSMA-expressing 22Rv1 xenograft model. Conclusion Probe 2 can potently bind to PSMA, and the fluorescence signal can be sensitively switched on by caspase-3 both in vitro and in vivo. This method may provide an effective tool to investigate and optimize PSMA-RLT.

It allows an analysis of the interactions of hormones, neurotransmitters, and related drugs with their receptors. Most of the binding assays have widely been applied to crude membrane fractions prepared from many tissues, but in the conventional method, there are some limitations such as a yield loss of receptor-bearing membranes and a change in receptor environment upon homogenization and fractionation. Recently, in order to overcome these problems, a binding assay has been developed using intact tissue segments. This article presents a brief overview of the tissue segment binding assay that has been developed mainly in our department. Practical guidelines for setting up this new assay are presented, including segment preparation, choice of appropriate radioligand, optimizing assay conditions, and appropriate methods for data analysis. The unique advantages and disadvantages of the tissue segment binding method are discussed in comparison with those of conventional membrane binding methods. We suggest that the tissue segment binding method is a powerful tool for detecting the native properties of receptors occurring in tissues and cells without altering their environment.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands for Imaging and Therapy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate cancer; prostate-specific membrane antigen; imaging; therapy	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; I-AND-T; GA-68-LABELED PSMA LIGAND; SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITORS; LYMPH-NODE DISSECTION; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; GA-68-PSMA PET/CT; BIOCHEMICAL RECURRENCE; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY	The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed on most prostate cancer (PC) cells. Therefore, the targeting of PSMA has become increasingly important over the last decade. Glu-urea-based PSMA ligands used for both imaging and radioligand therapy are the mainstays of the current success. For PET imaging, both Ga-68- and F-18-labeled agents have been successfully translated to clinical applications. Mainly retrospective cohort studies have shown a high value in the setting of biochemical recurrence, with high detection rates even in the presence of low prostate-specific antigen levels. Preliminary data indicated that radioguided surgery with PSMA ligands may help to further improve patient outcomes because it facilitates the removal of small tumor deposits that are otherwise difficult to detect. For primary PC, PSMA ligand PET imaging has been shown to be superior to cross-sectional imaging for the detection of metastatic lymph nodes. In addition, it promises to also provide intraprostatic tumor localization, especially when used in combination with multi-parametric MRI. Increasing numbers of studies have reported considerable changes in management resulting from PSMA ligand PET imaging for both biochemical recurrence and primary disease. The use of Lu-177-PSMA-based radioligand therapy has demonstrated a reasonable response, mainly as defined by a prostate-specific antigen response of more than 50%, comparable to other recently introduced agents. Especially given the high level of safety of Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy, with only minimal grade 3 and 4 toxicities reported so far, it has the potential to expand options for metastatic castration-resistant PC. This review is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature on low-molecular-weight PSMA ligands for both PET imaging and therapeutic approaches, with a focus on agents that have been clinically adopted.

Identifying a specific S1PR PET radioligand is imperative, but it is hindered by the complexity and variability of current for binding affinity measurement procedures. Herein, we report a streamlined protocol for radiosynthesis of [P-32]S1P with good radiochemical yield (36-50%) and high radiochemical purity (>99%). We also report a reproducible procedure for determining the binding affinity for compounds targeting S1PRs in vitro. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The [I-125] analogue was prepared via iododestannylation reaction in radiochemical yields of 75%-85% and a specific activity > 76 GBq/mu mol. After injection of [I-125] ITFZOL into mice through the tall vein, high accumulations of radioactivity were found in PBR-rich tissues such as adrenal, lung, kidney, heart, olfactory bulb and cerebellum. Per-administration of PBR-selective PK11195 displayed a significant reduction of radioactivity, suggesting a high specific binding of [I-125] ITFZOL to PBR. The biological data reveal that [I-125] ITFZOL is a potential and selective single photo emitting radioligand for PBR.

Development and Utilization of a Fluorescence-Based Receptor-Binding Assay for the Site 5 Voltage-Sensitive Sodium Channel Ligands Brevetoxin and Ciguatoxin	JOURNAL OF AOAC INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							RED TIDES; ACTIVATORS; DISCOVERY; BARRACUDA; CIGUATERA; SHELLFISH; TOXINS; ELISA	Brevetoxins are a family of ladder-frame polyether toxins produced during blooms of the marine dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. Consumption of fish exposed to K. brevis blooms can lead to the development of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. The toxic effects of brevetoxins are due to activation of voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs) in cell membranes. Binding of toxins has historically been measured using a radioligand competition assay that is fraught with difficulty. In this study, we developed a novel fluorescence-based binding assay for the brevetoxin receptor. Several fluorophores were conjugated to polyether brevetoxin-2 and used as the labeled ligand. Brevetoxin analogs were able to compete for binding with the fluorescent ligands. This assay was qualified against the standard radioligand receptor assay for the brevetoxin receptor. Furthermore, the fluorescence-based assay was used to determine relative concentrations of toxins in raw extracts of K. brevis culture, and to determine ciguatoxin affinity to site 5 of VSSCs. The fluorescence-based assay was quicker, safer, and far less expensive. As such, this assay can be used to replace the current radioligand assay and will be a vital tool for future experiments examining the binding affinity of various ligands for site 5 on sodium channels.

Molecular orbital (MO) calculation predicts that N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-nitro-4-trimethylammoniumtrifluoromethanesulfonylphenylthio)benzamide (8) is probably a better precursor than N,N-dimethyl-2-(2,4-dinitrophenylthio)benzylamine (1) for preparing 2. Radioligand 2 was synthesized by the reaction of either precursor 1 or precursor 8 with K[F-18]/K-2.2.2 at 120 degrees C followed by reduction with BH3 at 80 degrees C. The radiochemical yield (EOB) of 2 synthesized from precursor 1 and 8 was 5.7 +/- 2.4% (n = 6) and 14.8 +/- 4.0% (n = 5), respectively, in a synthesis time of 120 min from EOB. The specific activity of 2 was 3 Ci/mu mol or 111 GBq/mu mol (EOB). Thus, this new synthetic method has significantly improved the radiochemical yield of 4-[F-18]-ADAM and makes this radioligand more accessible to PET Centers without a cyclotron.

Selectivity for only one of the two receptors was exhibited by asiatic acid and its saponins (ETA) and oleanolic acid (AT(1)). To a lesser extent betulinic acid, beta-amyrin and friedelin also showed selectivity for the ETA receptor. To address the question whether the effect of saponins on cell membranes might interfere with the normal binding of specific radioligands to their receptors, the activity of saponins with different haemolytic properties were compared. Highly haemolytic saponins such as alpha-hederin and beta-escine showed partial (60%) inhibition of radioligand-binding to the ETA receptor and complete inhibition (100%) to the AT(1) receptor. Moreover, the haemolytically inactive kryptoescine, at the same concentration, caused complete inhibiton of radioligand-binding to both receptors, indicating that inhibition of receptor binding was not related to the membrane-interacting properties of saponins.

[H-3]-flumazenil is an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors and is generally used as a radioligand. In this study, the binding parameters of [H-3]-flumazenil to rat cortical membranes were evaluated using two separation methods: filtration with GF/C filters and centrifugation. Additionally, the effects of vacuum pressure, exposure time to the cocktail, and geometry on the filtration method were studied. The binding parameters of [H-3]-flumazenil (K-d and B-max) were determined through saturation studies using two methods. The results from this study showed that the filtration method is time consuming and requires more steps to be completed. Because filtration causes partial elution of bound [H-3]flumazenil into the liquid scintillation cocktail, the results are not reproducible, which result in inaccurate estimation of the binding parameters. The centrifugation method in contrast to filtration is straightforward and produces reproducible as well as reliable results, all of the steps are performed in a single polypropylene tube, which eliminates the loss of tissue and avoids other systematic errors associated with transfer and handling.

Whole-body biodistribution and radiation dosimetry in monkeys and humans of the phosphodiesterase 4 radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C](<i>R</i>)-rolipram:: comparison of two-dimensional planar, bisected and quadrisected image analyses	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						[C-11](R)-rolipram; positron emission tomography; dosimetry; biodistribution	ROLIPRAM; RAT; PET; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; IV; PHARMACOKINETICS; INHIBITOR; BINDING; RABBIT	Introduction: [C-11](R)-Rolipram is a selective radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme that metabolizes 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate. The aim of this study was to estimate the human radiation absorbed dose of the radioligand based on its biodistribution in both monkeys and humans. Methods: Whole-body PET images were acquired for 2 h after injecting [C-11](R)-rolipram in eight healthy humans and three monkeys. The simple method of using a single two-dimensional (2D) planar image was compared to more time-consuming methods that used two (bisected) or four (quadrisected) tomographic images in the anteroposterior direction. Results: Effective dose was 4.8 mu Gy/MBq based on 2D planar images. The effective dose was only slightly lower by 1% and 5% using the bisected and quadrisected images, respectively. Nevertheless, the two tomographic methods may have more accurately estimated the exposure of some organs (e.g., kidneys) that are asymmetrically located in the body or have radioactivity that appears to overlap on 2D planar images. Monkeys had a different biodistribution pattern compared to humans (e.g., greater urinary excretion) such that their data overestimated the effective dose in humans by 40%. Conclusions: The effective dose of [C-11](R)-rolipram was modest and comparable to that of other C-11-labeled radioligands. The simple and far less time-consuming 2D planar method provided accurate and somewhat more conservative estimates of effective dose than the two tomographic methods. Although monkeys are commonly used to estimate human radiation exposures, their data gave a considerable overestimation for this radioligand. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Hitherto available radioligands have displayed low affinity for the human neurokinin 3 receptor relative to the rodent homologue and may thus not be optimal for cross-species analyses of the expression of this protein. A novel neurokinin 3 receptor radioligand, [F-18]Lu AF10628 ((S)-N-(cyclobutyl(3-fluorophenyl)methyl)-8-fluoro-2-((3-[F-18]-fluoropropyl)amino)-3-methyl-1-oxo-1,2-dihydroisoquinoline-4-carboxamide), was synthesized and used for autoradiography studies in cryosections from guinea pig, monkey, and human brain as well as for positron emission tomography studies in guinea pig and monkey. The results confirmed previous observations of interspecies variation in the neurokinin 3 receptor brain localization with more extensive distribution in guinea pig than in primate brain. In the human brain, specific binding to the neurokinin 3 receptor was highest in the amygdala and in the hypothalamus and very low in other regions examined. Positron emission tomography imaging showed a pattern consistent with that observed using autoradiography. The radioactivity was, however, found to accumulate in skull bone, which limits the use of this radioligand for in vivo quantification of neurokinin 3 receptor binding. Species differences in the brain distribution of neurokinin 3 receptors should be considered when using animal models for predicting human neurokinin 3 receptor pharmacology. For positron emission tomography imaging of brain neurokinin 3 receptors, additional work is required to develop a radioligand with more favorable in vivo properties.

Occupancy of dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptors in rat brain by endogenous dopamine measured with the agonist positron emission tomography radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MNPA	SYNAPSE			English	Article						dopamine depletion; reserpine; alpha-methyl-pares-tyrosine; PET; D-2/3; receptor; [C-11]MNPA	IN-VIVO BINDING; D-2-DOPAMINE RECEPTORS; ANTERIOR-PITUITARY; DEPLETION; PET; AMPHETAMINE; RADIOTRACER; TRANSPORTER; QUANTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION	Estimates of dopamine D-2/3 receptor occupancy by endogenous dopamine using positron emission tomography (PET) in animals have varied almost threefold. This variability may have been caused by incomplete depletion of dopamine or by the use of antagonist radioligands, which appear less sensitive than agonist radioligands to changes in endogenous dopamine. PET scans were performed in rats with the agonist PET radioligand [C-11]MNPA ([O-methyl-C-11]2-methoxy-N-propylnorapomorphine). [C-11]MNPA was injected as a bolus plus constant infusion to achieve steady-state concentration in the body and equilibrium receptor binding in the brain. Radioligand binding was compared at baseline and after treatment with reserpine plus a-methyl-pares-tyrosine, which cause similar to 95% depletion of endogenous dopamine. Depletion of dopamine increased radioligand binding in striatum but had little effect in cerebellum. Striatal [C-11]MNPA binding potential was 0.93 +/- 0.12 at baseline and increased to 1.99 +/- 0.25 after dopamine depletion. Occupancy of D2/3 receptors by endogenous dopamine at baseline was calculated to be similar to 53%. Striatal binding was displaceable with raclopride, but not with BP 897 (a selective D-3 compound), thus confirming the D-2 receptor specificity of [C-11]MNPA binding. Radioactivity extracted from rat brain contained only 8-10% radiometabolites and was insignificantly altered by administration of reserpine plus a-methyl-pares-tyrosine. Hence, dopamine depletion did not increase the PET measurements via an effect on radiotracer metabolism. Our in vivo estimate of dopamine's occupancy of D-2/3 receptors at baseline is higher than that previously reported using antagonist radioligands and PET, but is similar to that reported using agonist radioligands and ex vivo measurements.

Development of a novel fluorine-18 labeled deuterated fluororasagiline ([<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluororasagiline-D<sub>2</sub>) radioligand for PET studies of monoamino oxidase B (MAO-B)	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Monoamine oxidase (MAO); PET; Monkey; Fluorine-18; Kinetics; Deuterium; Radiometabolites	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARKINSON-DISEASE; L-DEPRENYL; INHIBITORS; BRAIN; METABOLITES	The objective of this study was to synthesize and evaluate a novel fluorine-18 labeled deuterium substituted analogue of rasagiline (9, [F-18]fluororasagiline-D-2) as a potential PET radioligand for studies of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). The precursor compound (6) and reference standard (7) were synthesized in multi-step syntheses. Radiolabeling of 9 was accomplished by a two-step synthesis, compromising a nucleophilic substitution followed by hydrolysis of the sulfamidate group. The incorporation radiochemical yield from fluorine-18 fluoride was higher than 30%, the radiochemical purity was >99% and the specific radioactivity was >160 GBq/mu mol at the time of administration. In vitro compound 7 inhibited the MAO-B activity with an IC50 of 173.0 +/- 13.6 nM. The MAO-A activity was inhibited with an IC50 of 9.9 +/- 1.1 mu M. The fluorine-18 version 9 was characterized in the cynomolgus monkey brain where a high brain uptake was found (275% SUV at 4 min). There was a higher uptake in the striatum and thalamus compared to the cortex and cerebellum. A pronounced blocking effect (50% decrease) was observed in the specific brain regions after administration of L-deprenyl (0.5 mg/kg) 30 min prior to the administration of 9. Radiometabolite studies demonstrated 40% of unchanged radioligand at 90 min post injection. An efficient radiolabeling of 9 was successfully established and in the monkey brain 9 binds to MAO-B rich regions and its binding is blocked by the selective MAO-B compound L-deprenyl. The radioligand 9 is a potential candidate for human PET studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A, receptors were characterized using [H-3]-DPCPX binding with a K-D of 1.9 +/-0.2 nm and B-max of 23 +/-7 fmol mg(-1) of protein. A(2A) receptors were studied with [H-3]-SCH 58261 binding and revealed a K-D of 5.1 +/-0.2 nm and a B-max of 220 +/-7 fmol mg(-1) of protein. A(3) receptors were studied with the new A(3) adenosine receptor antagonist [H-3]-MRE 3008F20, the only A(3) selective radioligand currently available. Saturation experiments revealed a single high affinity binding site with K-D of 3.3 +/-0.7 nm and B-max of 291 +/- 50 fmol mg(-1) of protein. 3 The pharmacological profile of radioligand binding on A375 cells was established using typical adenosine ligands which displayed a rank order,of potency typical of the different adenosine receptor subtype. 4 Thermodynamic data indicated that radioligand binding to adenosine receptor subtypes in A375 cells was entropy- and enthalpy-driven. 5 In functional assays the high affinity A(2A) agonists HE-NECA, CGS 21680 and A(2A)-A(2B) agonist NECA were able to increase cyclic AMP accumulation in A375 cells whereas A(3) agonists Cl-IB-MECA, IB-MECA and NECA were able to stimulate Ca2+ mobilization. 6 In conclusion, all these data indicate, for the first time, that adenosine receptors with a pharmacological and biochemical profile typical of the A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) receptor subtype are present on A375 melanoma cell line.

J	Liu, L; Burcher, E				Liu, L; Burcher, E			Radioligand binding and functional characterisation of tachykinin receptors in chicken small intestine	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						tachykinins; tachykinin receptors; non-mammalian; chicken intestine; radioligand binding; longitudinal muscle; enteric neurons; indomethacin	RAT GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; TOAD BUFO-MARINUS; SUBSTANCE-P; NEUROKININ-A; NEUROPEPTIDE-GAMMA; SELECTIVE AGONISTS; INTERSTITIAL-CELLS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; GUT; IMMUNOREACTIVITY	Tachykinin receptors in chicken intestine were studied using radioligand binding and functional techniques. Mechanisms of tachykinin-induced contraction were also investigated. Binding of [I-125]Bolton-Hunter substance p ([I-125]BH-SP) to chicken ileal membranes was rapid, saturable, of high affinity and to a single population of binding sites with K-d 0.72 nM and B-max 0.48 fmol/wet weight tissue. The rank order of agonists competing for [I-125]BH-SP binding sites was [Sar(9)]SP > [Arg(3)]Sp (natural tachykinin in chickens) > SP > [Pro(9)]SP greater than or equal to NKA > eledoisin > [Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)]SP > > [Lys(5),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]-NKA(4-10) > > senktide, suggesting similarities to the mammalian NK1 receptor. The NK1 receptor antagonist CP 99994, and NK2 receptor antagonist SR 48968 were weak competitors while spantide, RP 67580, GR 82334, GR 94800 and MEN 11420 were ineffective. The radioligand [I-125]NKA showed no specific binding to ileal membranes. The potency order of most tachykinins in contacting isolated ileal longitudinal segments was in good agreement with that obtained from competition binding studies. Contractions to [Arg(3)]SP, NKA and senktide were greatly reduced by tetrodotoxin, suggesting that neurally-mediated responses were primarily involved. [Arg(3)]SP and NKA acted mainly by increasing release of acetylcholine, prostaglandins and probably tachykinins. Responses to [Arg(3)]Sp were virtually abolished by nifedipine but were unaffected by NK1 receptor antagonists. Senktide-induced contraction was inhibited by the NK3 receptor antagonist, SR 142801, but was unaffected by atropine or L-NAME. The study provides evidence for a tachykinin receptor with similarities to the NK1 receptor in the chicken small intestine. In addition, senktide may act on a receptor similar to the mammalian NK3 receptor.

Radiosynthesis and in vitro validation of <SUP>3</SUP>H-NS14492 as a novel high affinity alpha7 nicotinic receptor radioligand	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						alpha7; Radioligand; Autoradiography; Binding assay; PET ligand	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; PARTIAL AGONIST; VIVO EVALUATION; BINDING-SITES; MOUSE-BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; ANTAGONIST; OCCUPANCY; RAT	The neuronal alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a homo-pentameric ligand-gated ion channel that is a promising drug target for cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. We have previously described C-11-NS14492 as a suitable agonist radioligand for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) occupancy studies of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor in the pig brain. In order to investigate the utility of the same compound for in vitro studies, H-3-NS14492 was synthesized and its binding properties were characterized using in vitro autoradiography and homogenate binding assays in pig frontal cortex. H-3-NS14492 showed specific binding to alpha 7 nicotinic receptors in autoradiography, revealing a dissociation constant (K-d) of 2.1 + 0.7 nM and a maximum number of binding sites (B-max) of 15.7 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg tissue equivalent. Binding distribution was similar to that of another selective ligand I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin (I-125-BTX) in autoradiography, and unlabeled NS14492 displaced I-125-BTX with an inhibition constant (K-i) of 23 nM. H-3-NS14492 bound to alpha 7 nicotinic receptors in homogenized pig frontal cortex with a K-d of 0.8 +/- 0.3 nM and a B-max of 302 +/- 11.6 fmol/mg protein. This binding assay further revealed the K-i rank order for a number of alpha 7 nicotinic receptor agonists, and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). Further, we saw increased binding of H-3-NS14492 to pig frontal cortex membranes when co-incubated with PNU-120596, a type II PAM. Taken together, these findings show that H-3-NS14492 is a useful new in vitro radioligand for the pig alpha 7 nicotinic receptor. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

I-125-IABN was developed as a high-affinity radioligand selective for the D2-like (D2, D3, and D4) dopamine receptor subtypes. I-125-IABN binds with picomolar affinity and nonselectively to rat D2 and D3 dopamine receptors expressed in Sig and HEK 293 cells. I-125-IABN binds with 7- to 25-fold lower affinity to human D4.4 dopamine receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells. Dissociation constants (Rd) calculated from kinetic experiments were in agreement with equilibrium Kd values obtained from saturation binding studies. Saturation plots of the binding of I-125-IABN With rat caudate membrane preparations were monophasic and exhibited low nonspecific binding. The pharmacologic profile of the binding of I-125-IABN to rat caudate was consistent with a D2-like receptor, suggesting that the ligand binds primarily to D2 dopamine receptors. In addition, IABN was found to bind with low affinity to D1 dopamine receptors, as well as to the ol and sigma2 receptor subtypes. Quantitative autoradiographic studies using rat brain slices indicate that I-125-IABN selectively labels the striatum and the olfactory tubercle area, which is consistent with the labeling of D2-like receptors. IABN blocks dopamine-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity at D2 or D4.4 receptors expressed in HEK cells. Therefore, I-125-IABN appears to be a high-affinity, selective antagonist at D2-like dopamine receptors. Finally, a unique property of the azabicyclononane benzamide I-125-IABN compared to previously studied substituted benzamides is that the binding of this radioligand is not effected by variations in Na+ concentration.

Preclinically, inhibition of MAGL is known to provide therapeutic benefits for a number of neurological disorders. The availability of a MAGL-specific positron emission tomography (PET) ligand would considerably facilitate the development and clinical characterization of MAGL inhibitors via noninvasive and quantitative PET imaging. Herein, we report the identification of the potent and selective irreversible MAGL inhibitor 7 (PF-06809247) as a suitable radioligand lead, which upon radiolabeling was found to exhibit a high level of MAGL specificity; this enabled cross-species measurement of MAGL brain expression (B-max), assessment of in vivo binding in the rat, and nonhuman primate PET imaging.

Compelling evidence reveals that TRPC5 plays crucial roles in depression and other psychiatric disorders. To develop a TRPC5 radioligand, following up on our previous effort, we synthesized the iodine compound TZ66127 and its iodine-125-labeled counterpart [I-125]TZ66127. The synthesis of TZ66127 was achieved by replacing chloride with iodide in the structure of HC608, and the [I-125]TZ66127 was radiosynthesized using its corresponding tributylstannylated precursor. We established a stable human TRPC5-overexpressed HEK293-hTRPC5 cell line and performed Ca(2+)imaging and a cell-binding assay study of TZ66127; these indicated that TZ66127 had good inhibition activity for TRPC5, and the inhibitory efficiency of TZ66127 toward TRPC5 presented in a dose-dependent manner. Anin vitroautoradiography and immunohistochemistry study of rat brain sections suggested that [I-125]TZ66127 had binding specificity toward TRPC5. Altogether, [I-125]TZ66127 has high potential to serve as a radioligand for screening the binding activity of other new compounds toward TRPC5. The availability of [I-125]TZ66127 might facilitate the development of therapeutic drugs and PET imaging agents that target TRPC5.

Synthesis and simple <SUP>18</SUP>F-labeling of 3-fluoro-5-(2-(2-(fluoromethyl)thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzonitrile as a high affinity radioligand for imaging monkey brain metabotropic glutamate subtype-5 receptors with positron emission tomography	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MGLUR5 ANTAGONIST MPEP; POTENT; COCAINE; ANALOGS; RELAPSE; PET	2-Fluoromethyl analogs of (3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4yl)ethynyl]pyridine) were synthesized as potential ligands for metabotropic glutamate subtype-5 receptors (mGluR5s). One of these, namely, 3-fluoro-5-(2-(2-(fluoromethyl)thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzonitrile (3), was found to have exceptionally high affinity (IC50 = 36 pM) and potency in a phosphoinositol hydrolysis assay (IC50 = 0.714 pM) for mGluR5. Compound 3 was labeled with fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.7 min) in high radiochemical yield (87%) by treatment of its synthesized bromomethyl analog (17) with [F-18]fluoride ion and its radioligand behavior was assessed with positron emission tomography (PET). Following intravenous injection of [F-18]3 into rhesus monkey, radioactivity was avidly taken up into brain with high uptake in mGluR5 receptor-rich regions such as striata. [F-18]3 was stable in monkey plasma and human whole blood in vitro and in monkey and human brain homogenates. In monkey in vivo, a single polar radiometabolite of [F-18]3 appeared rapidly in plasma. [F-18]3 merits further evaluation as a PET radioligand for mGluR5 in human subjects.

For most GPCRs, the cell surface is their functional destination where they are able to respond a wide range of extracellular stimuli, leading to the activation of intracellular signal transduction cascades. Thus, the quantity of receptor expression at the cell surface is a crucial factor regulating the functionality of the receptors. Over the past decades, many methods have been developed to measure the cell surface expression of GPCRs. Here, we describe an intact live-cell radioligand binding assay to quantify the surface expression of GPCRs at the endogenous levels or after overexpression. In this assay, cell cultures will be incubated with specific cell-nonpermeable radioligands which selectively and stoichiometrically bind to individual GPCRs and the receptor numbers at the cell surface are quantified by the radioactivity of receptor-bound ligands. This method is highly specific for measuring the functional GPCRs at the surface of intact live cells and is particularly useful for endogenous, low-abundant GPCRs.

This method is aimed at detecting differences in radioligand binding between baseline and activation scans. It uses nonlinear least squares theory to estimate the ligand-receptor model parameters and utilizes the residuals to calculate their associated variance. The approach both increases the degrees of freedom for statistical testing and produces more accurate estimates of the standard deviation of the parameters. This technique is applicable to any ligand with a validated compartmental model, whether reversibly or irreversibly bound. The method was investigated and compared with a simple voxel-wise t test. Both simulated and real PET data for the dopamine D-1 receptor ligand [C-11]SCH 23390 were used to assess the method. The assumptions implicit in the residuals methods were validated. The residuals method was found to be more sensitive than a simple t test, while not producing false-positive results. In addition, we showed that this method reliably differentiates changes in radioligand binding from the effects of changes in cerebral blood how. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Additionally, their hypnotic activity was tested using the pentobarbital-induced sleep test. Compounds7(ED50 = 1.14 and 2.72 mu mol/kg in the MES and sleep tests, respectively) and11(ED50 = 0.65 and 2.70 mu mol/kg in the MES and sleep tests, respectively) were the most potent ones in the sleep test and anticonvulsant test, showing a comparable activity with diazepam as the reference drug. The results of in vivo studies, especially the antagonistic effects of flumazenil, and also the radioligand-binding assay confirmed the involvement of benzodiazepine (BZD) receptors in the anticonvulsant and hypnotic activity of compounds7and11. Finally, the docking study of compound11in the BZD-binding site of the GABA(A)(gamma-aminobutyric acid) receptor confirmed the possible binding of the compound to the BZD receptors. We concluded that the novel 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives with appropriate substitution at positions 2 and 5 of the heterocyclic ring had a good affinity to BZD receptors and showed significant efficacy in the pharmacological tests.

Clinical and neuroimaging features may be associated with gene carriage and/or may demarcate individuals at greater risk for phenoconversion to PD. Objectives: To investigate clinical and dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography imaging characteristics of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 asymptomatic carriers. Methods: A total of 342 carriers' and 259 noncarriers' relatives of G2019S leucine-rich repeat kinase 2/PD patients and 39 carriers' and 31 noncarriers' relatives of R1441G leucine-rich repeat kinase 2/PD patients were evaluated. Motor and nonmotor symptoms were assessed using specific scales and questionnaires. Neuroimaging quantitative data were obtained in 81 carriers and compared with 41 noncarriers. Results: G2019S carriers scored higher in motor scores and had lower radioligand uptake compared to noncarriers, but no differences in nonmotor symptoms scores were observed. R1441G carriers scored higher in motor scores, had lower radioligand uptake, and had higher scores in depression, dysautonomia, and Rapid Eye Movements Sleep Behavior Disorder Screening Questionnaire scores, but had better cognition scores than noncarriers. Among G2019S carriers, a group with "mild motor signs" was identified, and was significantly older, with worse olfaction and lower radioligand uptake. Conclusions: G2019S and R1441G carriers differ from their noncarriers' relatives in higher motor scores and slightly lower radioligand uptake. Nonmotor symptoms were mild, and different nonmotor profiles were observed in G2019S carriers compared to R1441G carriers. A group of G2019S carriers with known prodromal features was identified. Longitudinal studies are required to determine whether such individuals are at short-term risk of developing overt parkinsonism.

Synthesis and Evaluation of Trans locator 18 kDa Protein (TSPO) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Radioligands with Low Binding Sensitivity to Human Single Nucleotide Polymorphism rs6971	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						TSPO; PET; radioligand; carbon-11; imaging; brain	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; HUMAN-BRAIN; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; ACTIVATED MICROGLIA; HEALTHY HUMANS; FREE-FRACTION; SITES; AFFINITY; LIGANDS	The imaging of translocator 18 kDa protein (TSPO) in living human brain with radioligands by positron emission tomography (PET) has become an important means for the study of neuroinflammatory conditions occurring in several neuropsychiatric disorders. The widely used prototypical PET radioligand [(11)C](R)-PK 11195 ([(11)C](R)-1; [N-methyl-(11)C](R)-N-sec-butyl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide) gives a low PET signal and is difficult to quantify, whereas later generation radioligands have binding sensitivity to a human single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs6971, which imposes limitations on their utility for comparative quantitative PET studies of normal and diseased subjects. Recently, azaisosteres of 1 have been developed with improved drug-like properties, including enhanced TSPO affinity accompanied by moderated lipophilicity. Here we selected three of these new ligands (7-9) for labeling with carbon-11 and for evaluation in monkey as candidate PET radioligands for imaging brain TSPO. Each radioligand was readily prepared by (11)C-methylation of an N-desmethyl precursor and was found to give a high proportion of TSPO-specific binding in monkey brain. One of these radioligands, [(11)C]7, the direct 4-azaisostere of 1, presents many radioligand properties that are superior to those reported for [(11)C]1, including higher affinity, lower lipophilicity, and stable quantifiable PET signal. Importantly, 7 was also found to show very low sensitivity to the human SNP rs6971 in vitro. Therefore, [(11)C]7 now warrants evaluation in human subjects with PET to assess its utility for imaging TSPO in human brain, irrespective of subject genotype.

Kinetic brain analysis and whole-body imaging in monkey of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MNPA:: A dopamine agonist radioligand	SYNAPSE			English	Article						PET; [C-11]MNPA; dosimetry; DA D-2/3 receptor agonist radioligand; whole-body biodistribution; kinetic analysis	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; RECEPTOR-BINDING; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; REFERENCE REGION; D-2/3 AGONIST; PET; ANTAGONIST; BIODISTRIBUTION	With a view to future extension of the use of the agonist radioligand [C-11]MNPA ([O-methyl-C-11]2-methoxy-N-propylnorapomorphine) from animals to humans, we performed two positron emission tomography (PET) studies in monkeys. First, we assessed the ability to quantify the brain uptake of [C-11]MNPA with compartmental modeling. Second, we estimated the radiation exposure of [C-11]MNPA to human subjects based on whole-body imaging in monkeys. Brain PET scans were acquired for 90 min and included concurrent measurements of the plasma concentration of unchanged radioligand. Time-activity data from striatum and cerebellum were quantified with two methods, a reference tissue model and distribution volume. Whole-body PET scans were acquired for 120 min using four bed positions from head to mid thigh. Regions of interest were drawn on compressed planar whole-body images to identify organs with the highest radiation exposures. After injection of [C-11]MNPA, the highest concentration of radioactivity in brain was in striatum, with lowest levels in cerebellum. Distribution volume was well identified with a two-tissue compartmental model and was quite stable from 60 to 90 min. Whole-body PET scans showed the organ with the highest radiation burden (mu Sv/MBq) was the urinary bladder wall (26.0), followed by lungs (22.5), gallbladder wall (21.9), and heart wall (16.1). With a 2.4-h voiding interval, the effective dose was 6.4 mu Sv/MBq (23.5 mrem/mCi). In conclusion, brain uptake of [C-11]MNPA reflected the density of D-2/3 receptors, quantified relative to serial arterial measurements, and caused moderate to low radiation exposure.

PSMA can be targeted by Lu-177 conjugated to PSMA-617, a high-affinity ligand for the PSMA. The binding of the radioligand, Lu-177-PSMA-617, results in its internalisation and delivery of beta-radiation into the cancer cells. However, PSMA-617, a component of the final product in the synthesis of the radioligand, may also play a role in the pathophysiology of PCa cells. The present study aimed to clarify the effects of PSMA-617 (10, 50 and 100 nM) on the expression of PSMA in PSMA-positive LNCaP cells, their proliferation, Lu-177-PSMA-617-induced cell death by WST-1 and lactate dehydrogenase assays, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, immunofluorescence staining and uptake of Lu-177-PSMA-617. PSMA-617 at 100 nM concentration induced cell-growth arrest, down-regulated cyclin D1 and cyclin E1 (by 43 and 36%, respectively) and up-regulated the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1) (by 48%). Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated reduced content of DNA, pointing to a lower rate of cell division. PSMA-617 (up to 100 nM) did not alter the uptake of Lu-177-PSMA-617 into the LNCaP cells. Interestingly, simultaneous treatment with Lu-177-PSMA-617 and PSMA-617 for 24 and 48 h substantially potentiated the cell-death promoting effects of the radioligand. In conclusion, the combination of impeding tumour cell proliferation by PSMA-617 and its potentiation of the radiation-induced cell death brought about by Lu-177-PSMA-617 in PCa cells may considerably improve the outcome of the radiation therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617, especially in patients with decreased radiosensitivity of PCa cells to the radioligand.

We have demonstrated that AAK1 inhibitors are efficacious in rodent models of neuropathic pain (Kostich et al., 2016). Here we have characterized the binding properties and distribution pattern of the tritiated AAK1 radioligand, [H-3] BMT-046091, in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys, and used the radioligand to measure the brain target occupancy following systemic administration of AAK1 inhibitors. We have found that [H-3]BMT-046091 is potent and selective AAK1 inhibitor. It inhibits AAK1 phosphorylation of a peptide derived from a physiologic substrate, the mu 2 subunit of the adaptor protein complex, with an IC50 value of 2.8 nM, and is inactive at > 5 mu M in a panel of functional or binding assays for receptors, transporters and enzymes. [3H] BMT-046091 binding in the brain is absent in the AAK1 knockout mouse, and is displaceable with a high concentration of AAK1 inhibitors in wild type mice. Specific [3H]BMT-046091 binding is widespread in the brain and spinal cord with the highest density in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, striatum and thalamus. In the spinal cord, [3H]BMT-046091 binding appears enriched in the dorsal horn superficial layers. Oral administration of LP-935509, an AAK1 inhibitor, results in a dose-dependent occupation of AAK1 binding sites in the brain and spinal cord. The increase in AAK1 binding site occupancy by LP 935509 correlates with the decrease in antinociceptive responses in the rat chronic constriction injury model of neuropathic pain.

A previous study from our group showed that 4'-O-[F-18]fluoropropylcurcumin has poor brain permeability, which is thought to be due to its rapid metabolism. In this study, we synthesized difluoroboron complexes of fluorine-substituted curcumin derivatives (1-4) and selected one of them based on the in vitro binding assays. The selected ligand 2 was found to distinctively stain A beta plaques in APP/PS1 transgenic mouse brain sections. Radioligand [F-18]2 was synthesized via a two-step reaction consisting of [F-18]fluorination and subsequent aldol condensation. Biodistribution and metabolism studies indicated that radioligand [F-18]2 was converted to polar radioactive products and trapped in the normal mouse brain. In contrast, optical images of mice acquired after injection of 2 showed moderate fluorescence signal intensity in the mouse brain at 2 min with a decrease in the signal within 30 min. In the ex vivo optical images, the fluorescence signals in major tissues disappeared within 30 min. Taken together, these results suggest that [F-18]2 may be converted to polarl F-18-labeled blue-shifted fluorescent products. Further structural modifications are thus needed to render the radioligand metabolically stable.

Clinical Translation of a Click-Labeled <SUP>18</SUP>F-Octreotate Radioligand for Imaging Neuroendocrine Tumors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neuroendocrine; F-18-fluroethyl [Tyr(3)] octreotate analog; PET/CT imaging	SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR SCINTIGRAPHY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; CHROMOGRANIN-A; BIODISTRIBUTION; PET/CT; GA-68-DOTANOC; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONSENSUS	We conducted the first-in-human study of F-18-fluoroethyl triazole [Tyr(3)] octreotate (F-18-FET-beta AG-TOCA) in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) to evaluate biodistribution, dosimetry, and safety. Despite advances in clinical imaging, detection and quantification of NET activity remains a challenge, with no universally accepted imaging standard. Methods: Nine patients were enrolled. Eight patients had sporadic NETs, and 1 had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 syndrome. Patients received 137-163 MBq (mean +/- SD, 155.7 +/- 8 MBq) of F-18-FET-beta AG-TOCA. Safety data were obtained during and 24 h after radioligand administration. Patients underwent detailed whole-body PET/CT multibed scanning over 4 h with sampling of venous bloods for radioactivity and radioactive metabolite quantification. Regions of interest were defined to derive individual and mean organ residence times; effective dose was calculated with OLINDA 1.1. Results: All patients tolerated F-18-FET-beta AG-TOCA with no adverse events. Over 60% parent radioligand was present in plasma at 60 min. High tumor (primary and metastases)-to-background contrast images were observed. Physiologic distribution was seen in the pituitary, salivary glands, thyroid, and spleen, with low background distribution in the liver, an organ in which metastases commonly occur. The organs receiving highest absorbed dose were the gallbladder, spleen, stomach, liver, kidneys, and bladder. The calculated effective dose over all subjects (mean +/- SD) was 0.029 +/- 0.004 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: The favorable safety, imaging, and dosimetric profile makes F-18-FET-beta AG-TOCA a promising candidate radioligand for staging and management of NETs. Clinical studies in an expanded cohort are ongoing to clinically qualify this agent.

Recent studies have suggested that PDE10A inhibition is a novel approach for the treatment of disorders such as schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. A positron emission tomography (PET) occupancy study can provide useful information for the development of PDE10A inhibitors. We discovered T-773 as a candidate PET radioligand for PDE10A and investigated its properties by in vitro autoradiography and a PET study in a monkey. Methods: Profiling of T-773 as a PET radioligand for PDE10A was conducted by in vitro enzyme inhibitory assay, in vitro autoradiography, and PET study in a monkey. Results: T-773 showed a high binding affinity and selectivity for human recombinant PDE10A2 in vitro; the IC50 value in an enzyme inhibitory assay was 0.77 nmol/L, and selectivity over other PDEs was more than 2500-fold. In autoradiography studies using mouse, rat, monkey, or human brain sections, radiolabeled T-773 selectively accumulated in the striatum. This selective accumulation was not observed in the brain sections of Pde10a-KO mice. The binding of[H-3]T-773 to PDE10A in rat brain sections was competitively inhibited by MP-10, a selective PDE10A inhibitor. In rat brain sections, [H-3]T-773 bound to a single high affinity site of PDE10A with K-d values of 12.2 +/- 22 and 4.7 +/- 12 nmol/L in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens, respectively. In a monkey PET study, [C-11]T-773 showed good brain penetration and striatum-selective accumulation. Conclusion: These results suggest that [C-11]T-773 is a potential PET radioligand for PDE10A.

However, animal experiments have found considerable variability in DAT radioligand binding levels in brain after cocaine administration, perhaps caused by length and dose of treatment and type of radioligand used. The present experiments tested the hypothesis that [H-3]WIN 35428 binding and [H-3]dopamine uptake would be increased by exposure to cocaine through alterations in DAT cellular trafficking, rather than increased protein synthesis. Experiments were conducted in stably hDAT-transfected N2A cells and assessed the dose response and time course of cocaine effects on [H-3]WIN 35428 binding to the DAT, [H-3]dopamine uptake, measures of DAT protein and mRNA, as well as DAT subcellular location. Cocaine doses of 10(-6) M caused statistically significant increases in [H-3]WIN 35428 binding and [H-3]dopamine uptake after 12 and 3 h, respectively. Despite these increases in DAT function, there was no change in DAT total protein or mRNA. Immunofluorescence and biotinylation experiments indicated that cocaine treatment induced increases in plasma membrane DAT immunoreactivity and intracellular decreases. The present model system may further our understanding of regulatory alterations in DAT radioligand binding and function caused by cocaine exposure.

Evaluation of <SUP>18</SUP>F-RO-948 PET for Quantitative Assessment of Tau Accumulation in the Human Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neurology; PET; radiotracer tissue kinetics; Alzheimer disease; F-18-RO6958948 for tau imaging; radiotracer tissue kinetics	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; F-18-AV-1451; PATHOLOGY; BINDING; TRACER; QUANTIFICATION; RADIOLIGAND; VARIABILITY	The availability of tau PET radioligands enables quantitative assessment of tau density and distribution in the human brain. We evaluated the kinetics of a novel radioligand, F-18-RO-948 (previously referred to as F-18-RO6958948), and its ability to identify tau positivity in individual patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: Eleven subjects with amyloid-positive mild AD, 5 amyloid-negative older control subjects (OC), and 5 younger control subjects (YC) completed 1 or 2 (4 AD and 5 OC) PET scans with F-18-RO-948 for 90, 120, or 200 min. The kinetics of the radioligand was evaluated with standard compartmental and noncompartmental models (with plasma data in 70% of cases), tissue-reference methods, and SUV ratio. These approaches were applied to assess the ability of F-18-RO-948 to discriminate AD subjects from OC subjects. Results: The plasma reference graphical analysis appeared to be the optimal method of quantification for F-18-RO-948, yielding strictly time-consistent values of distribution volume and distribution volume ratio at 90 min against the analyses at 120 and 200 min. The reference tissue graphical analysis and SUV ratio were cross-validated against plasma reference graphical analysis. Test-retest evaluation showed excellent reproducibility. A proposed novel index of tau load, the regional tau-positive fraction, showed high values in the medial and lateral temporal and parietal regions in AD and successfully separated AD subjects from OC and YC subjects with a significant margin. Conclusion: F-18-RO-948 appears to be a promising radioligand for quantitative imaging of tau in the brain of AD patients.

Once activated by their cognate ligands, endocannabinoids, CB(1)Rs generally limit the timing of neurotransmitter release at many cortical synapses. Prior studies have indicated the involvement of CB, R in neurodegeneration and in various neuronal insults, with an emphasis on their neuroprotective role. In the present study we used a novel selective CB1R radioligand to investigate regional variations in CB1R ligand binding as a factor of progressive Braak tau pathology in the frontal cortex of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The frontal cortex was chosen for this study due to the high density of CB(1)Rs and their well-characterized involvement in the progression of AD. Post-mortem prefrontal cortex samples from AD patients from Braak stages I to VI and controls were subjected to CB1R autoradiography with [I-125]SD-7015 as radioligand. Regional concentration of [I-125]SD-7015, corresponding to, and thereby representing, regional CB1R densities, were expressed in fM/g_tissue. The results show that CB1B density inversely correlates with Braak tau pathology with the following tendency: controls <AD Braak stage V-VI <AD Braak stage III-1V <AD Braak stage I-II. Differences were significant between control and AD Braak stage I-II groups, as well as between controls and the AD group comprising all Braak stages. These findings indicate an up-regulation of the tissue binding of the selective CB1R radioligand [I-125]SD7015 in human brains, allowing the detection of fine modalities of receptor expression and radioligand binding during the progression of AD.

COX-1 expression is implicated in numerous neuroinflammatory states. We aim to find a direct-acting positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging COX-1 in human brain as a potential biomarker of neuroinflammation and for serving as a tool in drug development. Seventeen 3-substituted 1,5-diaryl-1H-1,2,4-triazoles were prepared as prospective COX-1 PET radioligands. From this set, three 1,5-(4-methoxypheny1)-1H-1,2,4-triazoles, carrying a 3-methoxy (5), 3-(1,1,1-trifluoroethoxy) (20), or 3-fluoromethoxy substituent (6), were selected for radioligand development, based mainly on their high affinities and selectivities for inhibiting human COX-1, absence of carboxyl group, moderate computed lipophilicities, and scope for radiolabeling with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min). Methods were developed for producing [C-11]5, [C-11]20, and [d(2)-F-18]6 from hydroxy precursors in a form ready for intravenous injection for prospective evaluation in monkey with PET.

Although preclinical and in vitro studies have suggested that the brain may contain immune cells also from peripheral origin, the functional association between immune cells in the periphery and brain at physiological conditions is poorly understood. We examined 32 healthy individuals using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]PBR28, a radioligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) which is expressed both in brain microglia and blood immune cells. In 26 individuals, two measurements were performed with varying time intervals. In a subgroup of 19 individuals, of which 12 had repeat examinations, leukocyte numbers in blood was measured on each day of PET measurements. All individuals were genotyped for TSPO polymorphism and categorized as high, mixed, and low affinity binders. We assessed TSPO binding expressed as total distribution volume of [C-11]PBR28 in brain and in blood cells. TSPO binding in brain was strongly and positively correlated to binding in blood cells both at baseline and when analyzing change between two PET examinations. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between change of leukocyte numbers and change in TSPO binding in brain, and a trend level correlation to change in TSPO binding in blood cells. These in vivo findings indicate an association between immunological cells in blood and brain via intact BBB, suggesting a functional interaction between these two compartments, such as interchange of peripherally derived cells or a common regulatory mechanism. Measurement of radioligand binding in blood cells may be a way to control for peripheral immune function in PET studies using TSPO as a marker of brain immune activation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

PET Imaging of High-Affinity α4β2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in Humans with <SUP>18</SUP>F-AZAN, a Radioligand with Optimal Brain Kinetics	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; nicotinic receptors; human neuroimaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; BINDING; LIGANDS; QUANTIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE; DERIVATIVES; DENSITY; SMOKERS	We evaluated (-)-2-(6-[F-18]fluoro-2,3'-bipyridin-5'-yl)-7-methyl-7-aza-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane (F-18-AZAN), a novel radiotracer that binds to alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs) and shows high specific binding and rapid and reversible kinetics in the baboon and human brain. Methods: We tested safety tolerability and test-retest reliability (n = 5) and proposed initial quantification of F-18-AZAN receptors in 3 healthy human subjects who had nicotine exposure and 9 who did not. We also present a receptor blocking study in a nicotine subject dosed with the alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR-selective partial agonist varenicline. Results: Radiation dosimetry PET/CT experiments indicated that most human organs received doses between 0.008 and 0.015 mSv/MBq, with an effective dose of approximately 0.014 mSv/MBq. The tracer rapidly entered the brain, and the peak was reached before 20 min, even for thalamus. Ninety-minute scans were sufficient for F-18-AZAN to obtain the ratio at equilibrium of specifically bound radioligand to nondisplaceable radioligand in tissue (BPND) using plasma reference graphical analysis, which showed excellent reproducibility of B-PND (test-retest variability < 10%) in the nAChR-rich brain regions. Regional plasma reference graphical analysis BPND values exceeded 2 in the midbrain tegmental nuclei, lateral geniculate body, and thalamus for nonsmokers (n = 9) but were less than 1 in the nAChR-poor brain regions. There was a dramatic reduction of F-18-AZAN brain uptake in smokers and varenicline-treated subjects. Conclusion: F-18-AZAN is a highly specific, safe, and effective PET radioligand for human subjects that requires only 90 min of PET scanning to estimate high-affinity alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR in the living human brain.

In an attempt to find the best condition for PSMA radioligand therapy in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, we evaluated the effect of oral enzalutamide in patients, predominantly having previously progressed on enzalutamide treatment. Methods Ten patients with advanced mCRPC scheduled for PSMA radioligand therapy were examined with Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT before and after a mean of 11.8 days of enzalutamide 160 mg/day. Imaging results were compared using total PSMA tumor burden quantification. We assessed whole-body total lesion PSMA (TLP), defined as SUVmean x tumor volume and calculated TLP-to-liver ratio (TLP-LR), TLP-to-parotid gland ratio (TLP-PR), and TLP-to-kidney ratio (TLP-KR). Results The mean (median) increase of TLP-LR, TLP-PR, and TLP-KR in the cohort was 49.3% (38.8%), 45.1% (23.5%), and 54.9% (37.6%), respectively. These increases were statistically significant (p = 0.002, p = 0.014, and p = 0.014), while PSA values did not change significantly (p = 0.846). Seven of the 10 patients had previously undergone enzalutamide treatment with eventual progression, formally classified as treatment failure. No side effects were noted in the short term. Conclusions Our results suggest that enzalutamide could be considered as a PSMA radioligand treatment enhancing primer medication, which may increase PSMA expression by a dimension of 50% in mCRPC. The effect was shown even in patients having previously failed enzalutamide treatment for arrest of progression in the mCRPC setting. Our observation deserves evaluation in a prospective setting.

In the assay system, [H-3]ditolylguanidine (DTG) was used as radioligand and membrane homogenates from human RT-4 cells physiologically expressing sigma(2) receptors served as receptor material. In order to block the interaction of the unselective radioligand [H-3]DTG with sigma(1) receptors, all experiments were performed in the presence of the sigma(1) selective ligand (+)-pentazocine. The density of sigma(2) receptors of the cells was analyzed by a saturation experiment with [H-3]DTG. The radioligand [H-3]DTG was bound to a single, saturable site on human sigma(2) receptors, resulting in a B-max value of 2108 162 fmol/mg protein and K-d-value of 8.3 +/- 2.0 nM. The expression of competing sigma(1) receptors was evaluated by performing a saturation experiment using the sigma(1) selective radioligand [H-3](+)-pentazocine, which resulted in a B-max value of 279 40 fmol/mg protein and K-d value of 13.4 +/- 1.6 nM. For validation of the sigma(2) binding assay, the K-i-values of four sigma(2) ligands (ditolylguanidine, haloperidol, rimczole and BMY-14802) were determined with RT-4 cell membrane preparations. The K-i values obtained from these experiments are in good accordance with the Ki-values obtained with rat liver membrane preparations as receptor material and with Ki values given in the literature.

Tactics for preclinical validation of receptor-binding radiotracers	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Imaging; Validation; Radiopharmaceutical; Radiotracer; Radiopharmacology; Sigma receptor	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; COCAINE-INDUCED HYPERACTIVITY; HIGH-AFFINITY RADIOLIGANDS; NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODELS; ASSESS RADIATION SAFETY; VIVO SIGMA-RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; HUMAN-BRAIN; PET TRACERS	Introduction: Aspects of radiopharmaceutical development are illustrated through preclinical studies of [I-125]-(E)-1-(2-(2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-5-yl)ethyl)-4-(iodoallyl)piperazine ([I-125]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE), a radioligand for sigma-1 (sigma(1)) receptors, coupled with examples from the recent literature. Findings are compared to those previously observed for [I-125]-(E)-1-(2-(2,3-dimethoxy-5-yl)ethyl)-4-(iodoallyl)piperazine ([I-125]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE). Methods: Syntheses of E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE and [I-125]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE were accomplished by standard methods. In vitro receptor binding studies and autoradiography were performed, and binding potential was predicted. Measurements of lipophilicity and protein binding were obtained. In vivo studies were conducted in mice to evaluate radioligand stability, as well as specific binding to sigma(1) sites in brain, brain regions and peripheral organs in the presence and absence of potential blockers. Results: E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE exhibited high affinity and selectivity for sigma(1) receptors (K-i = 0.43 +/- 0.03 nM, sigma(2)/sigma(1) = 173). [I-125]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE was prepared in good yield and purity, with high specific activity. Radioligand binding provided dissociation (k(off)) and association (k(on)) rate constants, along with a measured K-d of 0.24 +/- 0.01 nM and B-max of 472 +/- 13 fmol/mg protein. The radioligand proved suitable for quantitative autoradiography in vitro using brain sections. Moderate lipophilicity, Log D-7.4 2.69 +/- 0.28, was determined, and protein binding was 71 +/- 0.3%. In vivo, high initial whole brain uptake, >6% injected dose/g, cleared slowly over 24 h. Specific binding represented 75% to 93% of total binding from 15 min to 24 h. Findings were confirmed and extended by regional brain biodistribution. Radiometabolites were not observed in brain (1%). Conclusions: Substitution of dihydrobenzofuranylethyl for dimethoxyphenethyl increased radioligand affinity for sigma(1) receptors by 16-fold. While high specific binding to sigma(1) receptors was observed for both radioligands in vivo, [I-125]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE displayed much slower clearance kinetics than [I-125]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE. Thus, minor structural modifications of cri receptor radioligands lead to major differences in binding properties in vitro and in vivo. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As a PET radioligand, AFA (8) can be labeled with either C-11 or F-18. In vitro, AFA displayed high affinity for SERT (K-i 1.46+/-0.15 nM) and lower affinity for norepinephrine transporter (NET, Ki 141.7+/-47.4 nM) or dopamine transporter (DAT, Ki >10,000 nM). [C-11]AFA (10) was prepared from its monomethylamino precursor 9 by reaction with high specific activity [C-11]methyl iodide. Radiochemical yield was 43+/-20% based on [C-11]methyl iodide at end of bombardment (EOB, n = 10) and specific activity was 2,129+/-1,369 Ci/mmol at end of synthesis (EOS, n = 10). Biodistribution Studies in rats indicated that [C-11]AFA accumulated in brain regions known to contain high concentrations of SERT. Binding in SERT-rich brain regions was reduced significantly by pretreatment with either the cold compound 8 or with the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, but not by the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor nisoxetine, thus underlining its in vivo binding selectivity and specificity for SERT. Imaging experiments in baboons demonstrated that the uptake pattern of [C-11]AFA in the baboon brain is consistent with the known distribution of SERT, with highest activity levels in the midbrain and thalamus, followed by striatum, hippocampus. and cortical regions. Activity levels in the baboon brain peaked at 15-40 min after radioligand injection, indicating a fast uptake kinetics for [C-11]AFA. Pretreatment of the baboon with citalopram (4 mg/kg) significantly reduced the specific binding of [C-11]AFA in all SERT-containing brain regions. Kinetic analysis revealed that the regional equilibrium specific to non-specific partition coefficients (V-3") of [C-11]AFA are similar to those of [C-11]McN5652, but lower than those of [C-11]AFM or [C-11]DASB. In summary, [C-11]AFA appears to be an appropriate PET radioligand with a fast brain uptake kinetics: (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The affinity of indole derivatives 2a-e (10(-6)-5x10(-7)-10(-7) M) for receptors is defined as inhibition percentage of radioligand/receptor binding and measured as the radioactivity of remaining complex radioligand/receptor. The results of our experiments indicate that compounds 2a and 2e show high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptors; compounds 2b and 2c show high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptors and compound 2d shows high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptors. Results of computational chemistry suggest that the presence of a methoxyl group in 6 on the indole system is necessary for the scrotoninergic activity.

Radiochemical synthesis of [F-18]1 was carried Out by labeling 4-trimethylammoniumthalidomide trifluoromethanesulfonate with nBu(4)N[F-18]F in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by reverse-phase HPLC purification. Decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [F-18]1 was 50-60%, with all effective specific activity of 42-120 GBq/mu mol (end of synthesis). Incubation of the radioligand with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC-C; American Type Culture Collection) showed a time-dependent increase in the uptake of the radioligand, and the uptake was inhibited by 8-11% in the presence of 10 mu M thalidomide, indicating nonspecific binding of the radioligand. Positron emission tomography (PET) images of mice implanted with tumors in their right flanks revealed a marked accumulation of radioactivity in the livers, kidneys and bladders of the mice, and brain uptake appeared at approximately 40 min after injection. However, no radioactivity uptake was detected in the implanted tumor. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC), HPLC and LC-MS analyses of mouse liver microsomal metabolites of [F-18]1 and 1 with or without nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) clearly revealed that the radioligand did not go through metabolic activation but underwent nonenzymatic hydrolysis at physiological pH. Therefore, these results would appear to indicate that [F-18]1 may not be suitable for the ill vivo studies of angiogenesis at least ill mice, although it was reported that thalidomide and/or its hydrolysis products may be responsible for its activity in humans.

As astrocyte activity and, consequently, the activity of the MAO-B enzyme, is up-regulated in neuroinflammatory processes, radiolabelled analogues of deprenyl may serve as an imaging biomarker in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, including Alzheimer's disease. In the present study [C-11]-L-deprenyl, the PET radioligand version of L-deprenyl or selegiline (R), a selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor was used in whole hemisphere autoradiographic experiments in human brain sections in order to test the radioligand's binding to the MAO-B enzyme in human brain tissue, with an eye on exploring the radioligand's applicability as a molecular imaging biomarker in human PET studies, with special regard to diagnostic detection of reactive astrogliosis. Whole hemisphere brain sections obtained from Alzheimer patients and from age matched control subjects were examined. In control brains the binding of [C-11]-L-deprenyl was the highest in the hippocampus, in the basal ganglia, the thalamus, the substantia nigra, the corpus geniculatum laterale, the nucleus accumbens and the periventricular grey matter. In Alzheimer brains significantly higher binding was observed in the temporal lobes and the white matter. Furthermore, in the Alzheimer brains in the hippocampus, temporal lobe and white matter the binding negatively correlated with Braak stages. The highest binding was observed in Braak I-II, whereas it decreased with increasing Braak grades. The increased regional binding in Alzheimer brains coincided with the presence of an increased number of activated astrocytes, as demonstrated by correlative immunohistochemical studies with GFAP in adjacent brain slices. Deprenyl itself as well as the MAO-B antagonist rasagiline did effectively block the binding of the radioligand, whereas the MAO-A antagonist pirlindole did not affect it. Compounds with high affinity for the PBR system did not block the radioligand binding either, providing evidence for the specificity of [C-11]-L-deprenyl for the MAO-B enzyme. In conclusion, the present observations indicate that [C-11]-L-deprenyl may be a promising and selective imaging biomarker of increased MAO-B activity in the human brain and can therefore serve as a prospective PET tracer targeting neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration.

However, the relative utility of the diverse assays used for receptor detection/quantitation is disputed. We compared the utility of a monoclonal antibody-based semiquantitative immunohistochemical assay of estrogen receptor alpha (irERalpha) and of quantitative single-point radioligand assays of "cytosolic" estrogen (ERc) and progesterone receptors (PRc). Materials/Methods: Correlations were studied between the receptor levels in 235 breast cancers in patients treated between 1987 and 1990. Relationships were then analyzed between tumor receptor status, overall survival (OS; end-point: 10 years postmastectomy), age, axillary nodal status, and adjuvant tamoxifen in primary breast cancer patients for whom the respective data were accessible (N less than or equal to 121). Results: Univariate analysis showed no correlation between OS and the ERc status, whereas positive irERalpha status was a favorable (p < 0.05) prognosticator for the 5-year follow-up, and positive PRc status for the 10-year follow-up. Lymph node-positive patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen (2x10 mg/day) for a minimum of 12 months had significantly longer OS than those who did not receive the treatment. Multivariate regression of Cox proportional risk showed significance of axillary metastases, adjuvant tamoxifen, and ER status, but not of age and PRc status as independent prognosticators of OS. Conclusions: These results show the prognostic utility of the PRc radioligand assay, a slight prognostic advantage of the irERalpha assay over the radioligand ERc assay, and stress the importance of adjuvant antiestrogen therapy for overall survival in node-positive primary breast cancer patients.

Synthesis, Structure-Affinity Relationships, and Radiolabeling of Selective High-Affinity 5-HT<sub>4</sub> Receptor Ligands as Prospective Imaging Probes for Positron Emission Tomography	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO; GUINEA-PIG; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; SB-207710; ANALOGS; BINDING; MONKEY; ROUTE	In a search for.high-affinity, receptor ligands that might serve for development as radioligands for the imaging of brain 5-HT4 receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET), structural modifications were made to the high-affinity 5-HT4 antagonist (1-butylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 8-amino-7-iodo-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxine-5-carboxylate (1. SB 207710). These modifications were made mainly on the aryl side of the ester bond to permit possible rapid labeling of the carboxylic acid component with a positron emitter, either carbon-III 4,2 = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (4,2= 109.7 min), and included (i) replacement of the iodine atom with a small substituent such as nitrile, methyl, or fluoro. (ii) methylation of the S-amino group, (iii) opening of the dioxan ring, and (iv) alteration of the length of the N-alkyl goup. I Ugh-affinity ligands were discovered for recombinant human 5-HT4 receptors with amenability to labeling with a positron emitter and potential for development as imaging probes. The ring-opened radioligand, (([methoxy-C-11]1-butylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 4-amino-3-methoxybenzoate; [C-11]13), showed an especially favorable array of properties for future evaluation as a PET radioligand for brain 5-HT4 receptors.

The CRLR receptor phenotype can be determined by coexpression of CRLR with one of the three-receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs). In this report, we characterized the pharmacological properties of the human or porcine CRLR with individual RAMPs transiently expressed in human embroynic kidney cell line (HEK-293). Characterization of RAMP1/human or porcine CRLR combination by radioligand binding ([I-125] h alpha CGRP) and functional assay (activation of adenylyl cyclase) revealed the properties of CGRP receptor. Similarly characterization of RAMP2/human or porcine CRLR and RAMP3/human or porcine CRLR combination by radioligand binding ([I-125]rADM) and functional assay (activation of adenylyl cyclase) revealed the properties of ADM (22-52) sensitive-ADM receptor. In addition, porcine CRLR/RAMP2 or 3 combination displayed specific high affinity [I-125] h alpha CGRP binding also. Also, co-transfection of porcine CRLR with RAMPs provided higher expression level of the receptor than the human counterpart. Thus the present study along with earlier studies strongly support the role of RAMPs in the functional expression of specific CRLRs.

Available PET radioligands visualizing A beta bind to insoluble fibrils, i.e. A beta plaques. Levels of prefibrillar A beta forms, e.g. soluble oligomers and protofibrils, correlate better than plaques with disease severity and these soluble species are the neurotoxic form of A beta leading to neurodegeneration. The goal was to create an antibody-based radioligand, recognizing not only fibrillary A beta , but also smaller and still soluble aggregates. We designed and expressed a small recombinant bispecific antibody construct, di-scFv 3D6-8D3, targeting the A beta N-terminus and the transferrin receptor (TfR). Natively expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), TfR could thus be used as a brain-blood shuttle. Di-scFv 3D6-8D3 bound to A beta 1-40 with high affinity and to TfR with moderate affinity. Di-scFv [I-124] 3D6-8D3 was injected in two transgenic mouse models overexpressing human A beta and wild-type control mice and PET scanned at 14, 24 or 72 h after injection. Di-scFv [I-124] 3D6-8D3 was retained in brain of transgenic animals while it was cleared from wild-type lacking A beta . This difference was observed from 24 h onwards, and at 72 h, 18 months old transgenic animals, with high load of A beta pathology, displayed SUVR of 2.2-3.5 in brain while wildtype showed ratios close to unity. A subset of the mice were also scanned with [C-11] PIB. Again wt mice displayed ratios of unity while transgenes showed slightly, non-significantly, elevated SUVR of 1.2, indicating improved sensitivity with novel di-scFv [I-124] 3D6-8D3 compared with [C-11] PIB. Brain concentrations of di-scFv [I-124] 3D6-8D3 correlated with soluble A beta (p < 0.0001) but not with total A beta, i.e. plaque load (p = 0.34). We have successfully created a small bispecific antibody-based radioligand capable of crossing the BBB, subsequently binding to and visualizing intrabrain A beta in vivo. The radioligand displayed better sensitivity compared with [C-11] PIB, and brain concentrations correlated with soluble neurotoxic A beta aggregates.

A PET tracer for PDE10A may serve as a tool to evaluate PDE10A expression in vivo in central nervous system disorders with striatal pathology. Here, we further characterized the binding properties of a previously reported radioligand we developed for PDE10A, [C-11]TZ1964B, in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHPs). The tritiated counterpart [H-3]TZ1964B was used for in vitro binding characterizations in rat striatum homogenates and in vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain slices. The carbon-11 labeled [C-11]TZ1964B was utilized in the ex vivo autoradiography studies for the brain of rats and microPET imaging studies for the brain of NHPs. MicroPET scans of [C-11]TZ1964B in NHPs were conducted at baseline, as well as with using a selective PDE10A inhibitor MP-10 for either pretreatment or displacement. The in vivo regional target occupancy (Occ) was obtained by pretreating with different doses of MP-10 (0.05-2.00 mg/kg). Both in vitro binding assays and in vitro autoradiographic studies revealed a nanomolar binding affinity of [H-3]TZ1964B to the rat striatum. The striatal binding of [H-3]TZ1964B and [C-11]TZ1964B was either displaced or blocked by MP-10 in rats and NHPs. Autoradiography and microPET imaging confirmed that the specific binding of the radioligand was found in the striatum but not in the cerebellum. Blocking studies also confirmed the suitability of the cerebellum as an appropriate reference region. The binding potentials (BPND) of [C-11]TZ1964B in the NHP striatum that were calculated using either the Logan reference model (LoganREF, 3.96 +/- 0.17) or the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM, 4.64 +/- 0.47), with the cerebellum as the reference region, was high and had good reproducibility. The occupancy studies indicated a MP-10 dose of 0.31 +/- 0.09 mg/kg (LoganREF)/0.45 +/- 0.17 mg/kg (SRTM) occupies 50% striatal PDE10A binding sites. Studies in rats and NHPs demonstrated radiolabeled TZ1964B has a high binding affinity and good specificity for PDE10A, as well as favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and binding profiles. Our data suggests that [C-11]TZ1964B is a promising radioligand for in vivo imaging PDE10A in the brain of living subject. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Evaluation of <SUP>11</SUP>C-NR2B-SMe and Its Enantiomers as PET Radioligands for Imaging the NR2B Subunit Within the NMDA Receptor Complex in Rats	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						NR2B subunit; NMDA receptor; GluN2B; sigma 1; NR2B-SMe	D-ASPARTATE RECEPTORS; N-METHYL; SIGMA-RECEPTORS; LIGANDS; BINDING; IFENPRODIL; ELIPRODIL; BRAIN; DRUG; DERIVATIVES	[S-methyl-11C](+/-)-7-methoxy-3-(4-(4-(methylthio)phenyl)butyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-1-ol (C-11-NR2B-SMe) and its enantio-mers were synthesized as candidates for imaging the NR2B subunit within the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor with PET. Methods: Brains were scanned with PET for 90 min after intravenous injection of one of the candidate radioligands into rats. To detect any NR2B-specific binding of radioligand in brain, various preblocking or dis-placing agents were evaluated for their impact on the PET brain imaging data. Radiometabolites from brain and other tissues were measured ex vivo and in vitro. Results: Each radioligand gave high early whole-brain uptake of radioactivity, followed by a brief fast decline and then a slow final decline. C-11-(S)-NR2B-SMe was studied exten-sively. Ex vivo measurements showed that radioactivity in rat brain at 30 min after radioligand injection was virtually unchanged radioligand. Only less lipophilic radiometabolites appeared in plasma. High-affinity NR2B ligands, Ro-25-6981, ifenprodil, and CO101244, showed increasing preblocking of whole-brain radioactivity retention with increasing dose (0.01-3.00 mg/kg, intravenously). Five sigma 1 antagonists (FTC146, BD1407, F3, F4, and NE100) and 4 sigma 1 agonists ((+)-pentazocine, (+/-)-PPCC, PRE-084, and (+)-SKF10047) were ineffective preblock-ing agents, except FTC146 and F4 at a high dose. Two potent sigma 1 receptor agonists, TC1 and SA4503, showed dose-dependent pre -blocking effects in the presence or absence of pharmacologic sigma 1 receptor blockade with FTC146. Conclusion: 11C-(S)-NR2B-SMe has adequate NR2B-specific PET signal in rat brain to warrant further evaluation in higher species. TC1 and SA4503 likely have off -target binding to NR2B in vivo.

AZ12204657 was radiolabeled using C-11- or H-3-labeled methyl iodide ([C-11/H-3]CH3I) in one step, and the conversion of [C-11/H-3]CH3I to the radiolabeled product [C-11/H-3]AZ12204657 was quantitative. The specificity of radioligand binding to GPR44 and the selectivity for beta cells were evaluated by in vitro binding studies on pancreatic sections from human and non-human primates as well as on homogenates from endocrine and exocrine pancreatic compartments.ResultsThe radiochemical purity of the resulting radioligand [C-11]AZ12204657 was >98%, with high molar activity (MA), 1351575GBq/mol (n=18). The radiochemical purity of [H-3]AZ12204657 was >99% with MA of 2GBq/mol. Pancreatic binding of [C-11/H-3]AZ12204657 was co-localized with insulin-positive islets of Langerhans in non-diabetic individuals and individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The binding of [C-11]AZ12204657 to GPR44 was >10 times higher in islet homogenates compared to exocrine homogenates. In human islets of Langerhans GPR44 was co-expressed with insulin, but not glucagon as assessed by co-staining and confocal microscopy.ConclusionWe radiolabeled [C-11]AZ12204657, a potential PET radioligand for the beta cell-restricted protein GPR44. In vitro evaluation demonstrated that [H-3]AZ12204657 and [C-11]AZ12204657 selectively target pancreatic beta cells. [C-11]AZ12204657 has promising properties as a marker for human BCM.

Muscarinic receptors in rat tissues were measured by radioligand binding assay using [H-3]imidafenacin. Specific [H-3]imidafenacin binding in rat tissues was saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. Estimated dissociation constants (K-d values) were significantly lower in submaxillary gland and prostate and higher in heart than in bladder, indicating lower K-d values in M-1 and M-3 subtype-than M-2 subtype-dominating tissues. Unlabeled imidafenacin and clinically used antimuscarinic agents competed with [H-3]imidafenacin for binding sites in bladder and other tissues in a concentration-dependent manner, which indicated pharmacological specificity of [H-3]imidafenacin binding sites. Pretreatment with N-(2-chloroethyl)-4-piperidinyl diphenylacetate (4-DAMP mustard), an irreversible inactivating agent of M-3 subtype, significantly decreased the number of [H-3]imidafenacin binding sites in bladder, submaxillary gland, and colon, but not in heart. [H-3]imidafenacin labeled muscarinic receptors in M-1 and M-3 subtype-dominating tissues with higher affinity than [N-methyl-H-3] scopolamine methyl chloride (NMS). [H-3]imidafenacin is a useful radioligand to label muscarinic receptors in M-1- and M-3-dominating tissues with high affinity. (C) 2016 The Authors.

This purification led to the isolation of two compounds identified as O-methyldauricine (1) and popisidine (2), which bind competitively to 5-HT1A receptors at high concentrations with K-i values of 4.5 and 5.8 mu M, with [H-3]8-OH-DPAT as the radioligand. These results suggest that both of these bisbenzyltetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids influence the activity of 5-HT1A receptors through competitive binding as agonists or antagonists and may possess anxiolytic and anti-depressive effects.

After a rapid decline, the specific binding levelled off at about 20% below the initial value. To unravel the responsible mechanism(s), we examined the relative contribution of binding to cells and walls of the culture wells respectively. Washout was also performed in the presence of an excess of unlabelled ligand and/or bovine serum albumin (BSA). The findings suggest that dissociated [3H]-rimonabant molecules not only undergo rebinding to the same or neighbouring receptors but also partition in the cell membranes and fix to the walls. As these non-receptor associations still occur in presence of unlabelled ligand, they can be erroneously regarded to represent 'specific binding'. While the unlabelled ligand was most effective in preventing receptor rebinding, BSA was most effective in preventing non-receptor associations. To measure receptor-dissociation only, washout is best performed in presence of unlabelled ligand and BSA or any other protein that can pick-up free radioligand molecules. Yet, washout in medium only could hint at mechanisms that affect the in vivo residence time of the drug in question.

A HepG2 human HCC subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was established. After intravenous injection of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 or [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 (37 MBq) into the mouse model, single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) was performed. Biodistribution studies were conducted to verify targeting specificity and pharmacokinetics. In the radioligand therapy study, mice were randomized into 4 groups: 37 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, 18.5 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, 7.4 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617, and saline (control). A single-dose administration was applied at the beginning of therapy studies. Tumor volume, body weight, and survival were monitored every 2 days. After the end of therapy, mice were euthanized. Tumors were then weighed, and systemic toxicity was evaluated via blood testing and histological examination of healthy organs.Results[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 were successfully prepared with high purity and stability. SPECT/CT and biodistribution showed that tumor uptake was higher and persisted longer for [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 compared with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 was rapidly cleared from the blood, while [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 persisted for significantly longer. In radioligand therapy studies, tumor growth was significantly suppressed in the 37 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, 18.5 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, and 7.4 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 groups compared to the saline group. Median survival was 40, 44, 43, and 30 days, respectively. No healthy organ toxicity was observed in safety and tolerability evaluation.ConclusionsRadioligand therapy using [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 significantly suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time in PSMA-positive HCC xenograft mice without obvious toxicity. These radioligands appear promising for clinical use in humans, and future studies are warranted.

Structural modifications to dofetilide were made by diversifying the substituents on the phenyl rings and the protonated nitrogen-and by varying the carbon chain length. The analogues were evaluated in a radioligand binding assay and SAR data were derived with the aim to specify structural features that give rise to hERG toxicity.

Currently, there are no suitable small molecule radioligands for alpha 7 nAChRs in the brain, although [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin has been widely used as a radioligand for alpha 7 nAChRs. In the present study, we characterized a new radioligand, 4-[H-3] methylphenyl 2,5-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane-2-carboxylate ([H-3)CHIBA-1001), a derivative of the selective alpha 7 nAChR agonist SSR180711, in brain membranes from rat, monkey, and human. Scatchard analysis revealed an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 193.4 nM in rat brain membranes at 4 degrees C, and the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) was 346.2 fmol/mg protein. The order of drugs for the inhibition of [H-3]CHIBA-1001 binding to rat brain membranes is SSR180711>A-844606>MG624>epibatidine>DMAB>A-582941, suggesting a similarity of alpha 7 nAChR pharmacological profiles. In contrast, alpha-bungarotoxin, MLA, and nicotine were found to be very weak. The distribution of [H-3]CHIBA-1001 binding to crude membranes from dissected regions of rat, monkey, and human brain was different from that of [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin binding, suggesting that [H-3]CHIBA-1001 binding sites may not be identical to [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin binding in the brain. In summary, [H-3]CHIBA-1001 would be a useful radioligand for alpha 7 nAChRs in the brains of rodents, non-human primates, and humans. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study we applied a pig model of renovascular hypertension to investigate the AT(1)R in vivo with positron-emission tomography (PET) and in vitro with quantitative autoradiography. AT(1)R PET measurements were performed with the radioligand [C-11]KR31173 in 11 control pigs and in 13 pigs with hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis; 4 were treated with lisinopril for 2 weeks before PET imaging. The radioligand impulse response function was calculated by deconvolution analysis of the renal time-activity curves. Radioligand binding was quantified by the 80-minute retention of the impulse response function. Median values and interquartile ranges were used to illustrate group statistics. Radioligand retention was significantly increased (P=0.044) in hypoperfused kidneys of untreated (0.225; range: 0.150 to 0.373) and lisinopril-treated (0.237; range: 0.224 to 0.272) animals compared with controls (0.142; range: 0.096 to 0.156). Increased binding of [C-11]KR31173 documented by PET in vivo was confirmed by in vitro autoradiography. Both in vivo and in vitro binding measurements showed that the effect of renal artery stenosis on the AT(1)R was not abolished by lisinopril treatment. These studies provide insight into kidney biology as the first in vivo/in vitro experimental evidence about AT(1)R regulation in response to reduced perfusion of the kidney. The findings support the concept of introducing AT(1)R PET as a diagnostic biomarker of renovascular disease.

Positive Allosteric Interaction of Structurally Diverse T-Type Calcium Channel Antagonists	CELL BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS			English	Article						T-type calcium channel; CaV3; CACNA1I; Synergy; Radioligand; Absence epilepsy; Seizure	CA2+ CHANNELS; PHARMACOLOGY; DISCOVERY; MECHANISMS; THALAMUS; SUBTYPES; NEURONS; SITES; ASSAY; GENE	Low-voltage-activated (T-type) calcium channels play a role in diverse physiological responses including neuronal burst firing, hormone secretion, and cell growth. To better understand the biological role and therapeutic potential of the target, a number of structurally diverse antagonists have been identified. Multiple drug interaction sites have been identified for L-type calcium channels, suggesting a similar possibility exists for the structurally related T-type channels. Here, we radiolabel a novel amide T-type calcium channel antagonist (TTA-A1) and show that several known antagonists, including mibefradil, flunarizine, and pimozide, displace binding in a concentration-dependent manner. Further, we identify a novel quinazolinone T-type antagonist (TTA-Q4) that enhanced amide radioligand binding, increased affinity in a saturable manner and slowed dissociation. Functional evaluation showed these compounds to be state-dependent antagonists which show a positive allosteric interaction. Consistent with slowing dissociation, the duration of efficacy was prolonged when compounds were co-administered to WAG/Rij rats, a genetic model of absence epilepsy. The development of a T-type calcium channel radioligand has been used to demonstrate structurally distinct TTAs interact at allosteric sites and to confirm the potential for synergistic inhibition of T-type calcium channels with structurally diverse antagonists.

The corresponding PET radioligand 4-[F-18]fluoro-N-{2-[4-(6-trifluoromethylpyridin2-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl}benzamide was synthesized by nucleophilic aromatic substitution on the nitro precursor. The fluorinating agent K[F-18]F/Kryptofix 2.2.2 was both dried (9 min, 700 W) and incorporated in the precursor (5 min, 700 W) using a commercially available microwave oven. In a total synthesis time of 60 min, an overall radiochemical yield of 18% (SD = 5, n = 7, EOS) was obtained. Radiochemical purity was always higher than 99% and specific activity always higher than 81.4 GBq/mumol (2.2 Ci/mumol). Initial brain uptake in mice was 2.19% ID (5.47% ID/g, 2 min) but decreased rapidly (0.17% ID, 0.45% ID/g (60 min)). During the first 20 min p.i., radioactivity concentration of the brain was significantly higher than that of blood demonstrating good brain entry of the tracer.

Generation of novel radiolabeled opiates through site-selective iodination	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Opioid receptor; Radioligand; Iodination	GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; OPIOID RECEPTORS; BINDING-SITES; MORPHINE; ANTINOCICEPTION; RADIOIODINATION; PHARMACOLOGY; ANALGESICS; NALOXONE; SUBTYPES	Tritiated opioid radioligands have proven valuable in exploring opioid binding sites. However, tritium has many limitations. Its low specific activity and limited counting efficiency makes it difficult to examine low abundant, high affinity sites and its disposal is problematic due to the need to use organic scintillants and its relatively long half-life. To overcome these issues, we have synthesized both unlabeled and carrier-free radioiodinated iodobenzoyl derivatives of 6 beta-naltrexamine ((125)I-BNtxA, 18), 6 beta-naloxamine ((125)I-BNalA, 19) and 6 beta-oxymorphamine ((125)I-BOxyA, 20) with specific activities of 2100 Ci/mmol. To optimize the utility of the radioligand, we designed a synthesis in which the radiolabel is incorporated in the last synthetic step, which required the selective iodination of the benzoyl moiety without incorporation into the phenolic A ring. Competition studies demonstrated high affinity of the unlabelled compounds for opioid receptors in transfected cell lines, as did the direct binding of the (125)I-ligands to the opioid receptors. The radioligand displayed very high sensitivity, enabling a marked reduction in tissue, as well as excellent signal/noise characteristics. These new (125)I-radioligands should prove valuable in future studies of opioid binding sites. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method: Thirty-two adult subjects were involved, 17 social drinkers as control subjects and 15 subjects who were abstinent or recovering alcoholics. Concomitant psychiatric diseases were ruled out based on DSM-IV criteria. The majority of subjects were men. Radioligand binding in 11 brain areas was expressed as the total distribution volume (DV), distribution volume of specific binding (DVspec), and distribution volume ratio (DVR). The cerebellum was used as reference tissue for calculation of DVspec and DVR. Results. In subjects with a history of alcoholism, DV was lower in all brain regions, with significant differences in the midbrain, thalamus, amygdala, pons, cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. Additionally, DVspec was lower in all brain regions, but differences were only significant in the midbrain; DVR was lower in nine regions but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: These studies demonstrate lower binding of [C-11](+)McN5652 to the SERT in the brain of abstinent or recovering alcoholics compared with control subjects. Differences in the radioligand distribution volumes are more significant before than after correction for nonspecific binding of the radioligand.

Accurate determination of plasma concentrations of unmetabolised radioligands is often important for quantification of data from PET studies. The fractions of untransformed radioligand and radioactive metabolites in plasma extracts must then be measured. Temporal changes in these fractions are influenced by the rate constant of appearance of total radioactive metabolites in plasma (apparent rate constant of metabolism in plasma, k(0)) and the net rate constant of elimination of all radioactive metabolites from plasma (k(-I)). In order to clarify the relationship between radioligand fractions and rate constants, plasma samples collected from Gottingen minipigs during PET recordings using four different binding site ligands were analysed by radio high performance liquid chromatography. The calculated plasma concentrations of parent compounds and their radioactive metabolites were used to calculate k(0) and k(-1) for C-11-labelled NNC 112, NS 2214, PK 11195 and raclopride in minipigs using a novel application of the tissue-slope intercept plot. In general, the apparent rate constant of metabolism in plasma was found to be greater in the minipig than in man. The reported kinetic analysis enables the apparent metabolism of PET radioligands in plasma to be quantified. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In vitro binding of tritium-labelled AZD2995 and AZD2184 was studied and compared with that of the established amyloid-beta PET radioligand PIB. Subsequently, a first-in-human in vivo PET study was performed using [C-11]AZD2995 and [C-11]AZD2184 in three healthy control subjects and seven AD patients. AZD2995, AZD2184 and PIB were found to share the same binding site to amyloid-beta. [H-3]AZD2995 had the highest signal-to-background ratio in brain tissue from patients with AD as well as in transgenic mice. However, [C-11]AZD2184 had superior imaging properties in PET, as shown by larger effect sizes comparing binding potential values in cortical regions of AD patients and healthy controls. Nevertheless, probably due to a lower amount of nonspecific binding, the group separation of the distribution volume ratio values of [C-11]AZD2995 was greater in areas with lower amyloid-beta load, e.g. the hippocampus. Both AZD2995 and AZD2184 detect amyloid-beta with high affinity and specificity and also display a lower degree of nonspecific binding than that reported for PIB. Overall [C-11]AZD2184 seems to be an amyloid-beta radioligand with higher uptake and better group separation when compared to [C-11]AZD2995. However, the very low nonspecific binding of [C-11]AZD2995 makes this radioligand potentially interesting as a tool to study minute levels of amyloid-beta. This sensitivity may be important in investigating, for example, early prodromal stages of AD or in the longitudinal study of a disease modifying therapy.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) has been identified as a risk factor or prodrome for neurodegenerative dementias, suggesting neuropathological overlaps and a continuum between MDD and neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we examined tau and amyloid-beta (A beta) accumulations in the brains of MDD and healthy controls using positron emission tomography (PET) to explore pathological substrates of this illness. Twenty MDD and twenty age-matched, healthy controls were examined by PET with a tau radioligand, [C-11]PBB3, and an A beta radioligand, [C-11]PiB. Radioligand retentions were quantified as a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). We also assessed clinical manifestations of the patients using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale, the Geriatric Depression Scale, and psychotic symptoms. Mean cortical [C-11]PBB3 SUVRs in MDD patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls. These values were higher in MDD patients with psychotic symptoms than in those without any. The present findings indicate that tau depositions may underlie MDD, and especially in patients with psychotic symptoms. PET detection of tau accumulations may provide mechanistic insights into neuronal dysfunctions in these cases and could serve as predictions of their clinical consequences.

In this paper, we report the design, synthesis, and evaluation of a FAPI tetramer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the tumor -targeting characteristics of radiolabeled FAPI multimers in vitro and in vivo, thereby providing information for the design of FAP-targeted radiopharmaceuticals based on the polyvalency principle. Methods: FAPI tetramers were synthesized on the basis of FAPI-46 and radiola-beled with Ga-68, Cu-64, and Lu-177. In vitro FAP-binding characteristics were identified using a competitive cell-binding experiment. To evaluate their pharmacokinetics, small-animal PET, SPECT, and ex vivo biodistri-bution analyses were performed on HT-1080-FAP and U87MG tumor- -bearing mice. In addition, the 2 tumor xenografts received radioligand therapy with Lu-177-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4, and the antitumor efficacy of the Lu-177-FAPI tetramer was evaluated and compared with that of the Lu-177-FAPI dimer and monomer. Results: Ga-68-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4 and Lu-177-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4 were highly stable in phosphate-buffered saline and fetal bovine serum. The FAPI tetramer exhibited high FAP-binding affinity and specificity both in vitro and in vivo. Ga-68-, Cu-64-, and Lu-177-labeled FAPI tetramers exhibited higher tumor uptake, longer tumor retention, and slower clearance than FAPI dimers and FAPI-46 in HT-1080-FAP tumors. The uptake (percentage injected dose per gram) of Lu-177-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4, Lu-177-DOTA-2P(FAPI)2, and Lu-177-FAPI-46 in HT-1080-FAP tumors at 24 h was 21.4 +/- 1.7, 17.1 +/- 3.9, and 3.4 +/- 0.7, respectively. Moreover, Ga-68-DOTA-4P(FAPI)4 uptake in U87MG tumors was approximately 2-fold the uptake of Ga-68-DOTA-2P(FAPI)(2) (SUVmean, 0.72 +/- 0.02 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.03, P < 0.001) and more than 4-fold the uptake of Ga-68-FAPI-46 (0.16 +/- 0.01, P < 0.001). In the radioligand therapy study, remarkable tumor suppression was observed with the Lu-177-FAPI tetramer in both HT-1080-FAP and U87MG tumor-bearing mice. Conclusion: The satisfactory FAP-binding affinity and specificity, as well as the favorable in vivo pharmacokinetics of the FAPI tetramer, make it a promising radiopharmaceutical for theranostic applications. Improved tumor uptake and prolonged retention of the Lu-177-FAPI tetra-mer resulted in excellent characteristics for FAPI imaging and radioli-gand therapy.

We report a case of a 59-year-old recently diagnosed prostate cancer with high PSA level pf >2000ng/ml referred for Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT. Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT showed diffuse intense tracer uptake throughout the axial and appendicular skeleton with significantly lower uptake of Ga-68-PSMA in normal organs in a configuration of "tumour sink effect". Findings are in keeping with diffuse skeletal infiltration and suspected marrow infiltration. Given the extensive nature of bone disease and pattern, 177Lu-PSMA-targetted radioligand therapy was thought to be more appropriate in a given situation with a favourable toxicity profile.

Assessment with the radiolabeled selective antagonist [<SUP>3</SUP>H]PSB-0413	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						P2Y(12) receptor; Competitive antagonist; Radioligand.; [H-3] PBS-0413; Platelets; Nucleotide analog.; AR-C67085MX	HUMAN-BLOOD PLATELETS; DRUG-INDUCED DEFECTS; ADENOSINE-DIPHOSPHATE; P2Y RECEPTORS; HIGH-AFFINITY; ADP; AGGREGATION; BINDING; IDENTIFICATION; RADIOLIGAND	Various radioligands have been used to characterize and quantify the platelet P2Y(12) receptor, which share several weaknesses: (a) they are metabolically unstable and substrates for ectoenzymes, (b) they are agonists, and (c) they do not discriminate between P2Y(1) and P2Y(12). We used the [H-3]PSB-0413 selective P2Y(12) receptor antagonist radioligand to reevaluate the number of P2Y(12) receptors in intact platelets and in membrane preparations. Studies in humans showed that: (1) [H-3]PSB-0413 bound to 425 +/- 50 sites/platelet (K (D) = 3.3 +/- 0.6 nM), (2) 0.5 +/- 0.2 pmol [H-3]PSB-0413 bound to 1 mg protein of platelet membranes (K (D) = 6.5 +/- 3.6 nM), and (3) competition studies confirmed the known features of P2Y(12), with the expected rank order of potency: AR-C69931MX > 2MeSADP a parts per thousand << aEuro parts per thousand ADP beta S > ADP, while the P2Y(1) ligand MRS2179 and the P2X(1) ligand alpha,beta-Met-ATP did not displace [H-3]PSB-0413 binding. Patients with severe P2Y(12) deficiency displayed virtually no binding of [H-3]PSB-0413 to intact platelets, while a patient with a dysfunctional P2Y(12) receptor had normal binding. Studies in mice showed that: (1) [H-3]PSB-0413 bound to 634 +/- 87 sites/platelet (K (D) = 14 +/- 4.5 nM) and (2) 0.7 pmol +/- 0.3 [H-3]PSB-0413 bound to 1 mg protein of platelet membranes (K (D) = 9.1 +/- 5.3 nM). Clopidogrel and other thiol reagents like pCMBS or DTT abolished the binding both to intact platelets and membrane preparations. Therefore, [H-3]PSB-0413 is an accurate and selective tool for radioligand binding studies aimed at quantifying P2Y(12) receptors, to identify patients with P2Y(12) deficiencies or quantify the effect of P2Y(12) targeting drugs.

Quantification of PET infusion studies without true equilibrium: A tissue clearance correction	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Equilibrium; infusion; modeling; positron emission tomography; volume of distribution	PLUS-CONSTANT-INFUSION; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; BOLUS; 1ST-IN-HUMAN	In some positron emission tomography (PET) studies, a reversibly binding radioligand is administered as a constant infusion to establish true equilibrium for quantification. This approach reduces scanning time and simplifies data analysis, but assumes similar behavior of the radioligand in plasma across the study population to establish true equilibrium in all subjects. Bias in outcome measurements can result if this assumption is not met. This work developed and validated a correction that reduces bias in total distribution volume (V-T) estimates when true equilibrium is not present. This correction, termed tissue clearance correction (TCC), took the form VT=VT(A)/(1+beta gamma VT(A)), where beta is the radioligand clearance rate in tissue, gamma is a radiotracer-specific constant, and V-T(A) is the apparent V-T. Simulations characterized the robustness of TCC across imperfect values of gamma and beta and demonstrated reduction to false positive rates. This approach was validated with human infusion data for three radiotracers: [F-18]FPEB, (-)-[F-18]flubatine, and [C-11]UCB-J. TCC reduced bias in V-T estimates for all radiotracers and significantly reduced intersubject variance in V-T for [F-18]FPEB data in some brain regions. Thus, TCC improves quantification of data acquired from PET infusion studies.

Kinetic profiling and functional characterization of 8-phenylxanthine derivatives as A<sub>2B</sub> adenosine receptor antagonists	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						A(2B) adenosine receptor; Antagonists; Binding kinetics; Radioligand binding assay; Label-free functional assay; Covalent binding	TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; INTERNATIONAL UNION; HIGH-AFFINITY; DRUG; RADIOLIGAND; A(2A); CLASSIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE; CONSTANT; ANALOGS	A(2B) adenosine receptor (A(2B)AR) antagonists have therapeutic potential in inflammation-related diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cancer. However, no drug is currently clinically approved, creating a demand for research on novel antagonists. Over the last decade, the study of target binding kinetics, along with affinity and potency, has been proven valuable in early drug discovery stages, as it is associated with improved in vivo drug efficacy and safety. In this study, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of xanthine derivatives as A(2B)AR antagonists, including an isothiocyanate derivative designed to bind covalently to the receptor. All 28 final compounds were assessed in radioligand binding experiments, to evaluate their affinity and for those qualifying, kinetic binding parameters. Both structure-affinity and structure-kinetic relationships were derived, providing a clear relationship between affinity and dissociation rate constants. Two structurally similar compounds, 17 and 18, were further evaluated in a label-free assay due to their divergent kinetic profiles. An extended cellular response was associated with long A(2B)AR residence times. This link between a ligand's A(2B)AR residence time and its functional effect highlights the importance of binding kinetics as a selection parameter in the early stages of drug discovery.

The aim of this study is to compare the accuracy in calculation of absorbed dose to patients following radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 by two different methods of background correction in the conjugate view method. Materials and Methods: This study involved 10 patients. The individualized patient dosimetry calculations were based on whole-body planar scintigraphy images acquired in 10 patients with a mean age of 71.4 +/- 6.07 years (range 63-85 years) at approximately 0-2 h, 4-6 h, 18-24 h, and 36-48 h after administration of the mean 6253 +/- 826.4 MBq (range 5500-7400 MBq) of Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617. Organ activities were calculated using the conjugate view method by Buijs and conventional background correction. Eventually, the absorbed dose of radiation was calculated using Medical Internal Radiation Dose formalism. Results: The dose per unit of injected activity (mGy/MBq) +/- standard deviation for kidney using Buijs and conventional methods was 1.05 +/- 0.11 and 0.63 +/- 0.14, respectively. Conclusion: The Buijs background correction method was more accurate than the conventional method.

Analysis and Quantification of GPCR Heteroreceptor Complexes and Their Allosteric Receptor-Receptor Interactions Using Radioligand Binding Autoradiography	RECEPTOR-RECEPTOR INTERACTIONS IN THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM	Neuromethods		English	Article; Book Chapter						Receptor; Autoradiography; Radioligand binding; Brain cryosections; Brain tissue; Allosteric receptor-receptor interaction; Heteroreceptor complexes	RAT; LOCALIZATION; INVOLVEMENT; EXISTENCE; BRAIN	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) complexes and their allosteric receptor-receptor interactions represent a new fundamental principle in molecular medicine for integration of transmitter signals in the plasma membrane. The allosteric receptor-receptor interactions in heteroreceptor complexes give diversity, specificity, and bias to the receptor protomers due to conformational changes in discrete domains leading to changes in receptor protomer function and their pharmacology. Therefore, a novel understanding of the molecular basis of central nervous system diseases should consider this phenomena and new strategies for mental and neuro-degenerative disorders treatment should target heteroreceptor complexes based on a new pharmacology with combined treatment, multi-targeted drugs and heterobivalent drugs. In this chapter, it is described a technique to visualize the majority of G protein-coupled receptor allosteric receptor-receptor interactions in sections of frozen brain tissue using receptor autoradiography. The basic procedure involves incubating slidemounted tissue sections with radioligands, washing and drying of the sections with specifically bound ligands under conditions that preserve ligand binding, and visualizing and quantifying the binding sites in the tissues. Protocols for brain extraction and sectioning, radioligand exposure, autoradiogram generation, and data quantification are provided, as are the optimal incubation conditions for the autoradiographic visualization of allosteric receptor-receptor interactions using agonist and antagonist radioligands.

Based on molecular modeling studies, Thr130 and Asp125 in transmembrane region III of the alpha(1b)-AR receptor were found to interact with prazosin. Thr130 and Asp125 were mutated to alanine (Ala) and expressed in HEK293 cells. The radioligand [H-3]prazosin did not show any binding to Asp125Ala mutant of alb-AR. Therefore, it was not possible to find any prazosin affinity to the mutant using the radioligand [H-3]prazosin. The mutation also abolished phenylephrine-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) formation of [H-3]myo-inositol. On the other hand, the Thr130Ala 'mutant showed reduced binding affinity for [H-3]prazosin (dissociation constant, K-d 674.27 pm versus 90.27 pm for the wild-type receptor) and had reduced affinity for both tamsulosin and prazosin (11-fold and 9-fold, respectively). However, the Thr130Ala mutant receptor retained the ability to stimulate the formation of [H-3]myo-inositol. The results provide direct evidence that Asp125 and Thr130 are responsible for the interactions between alb-AR receptor and radioligand [H-3]prazosin as well as tamsulosin.

To gain more insight into the differences in the regulation of the two receptors, we studied the effect of agonist and antagonist pre-treatment on radioligand receptor binding and 5-HT-induced inositol phosphate formation on rat 5-HT2A and rat 5-HT2C receptors stable expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. We compared short (15 min) and prolonged (48 h) pre-treatment of the cells with the natural agonist, 5-HT and with the antagonist pipamperone, which can be readily washed out. The rat 5-HT2C receptor showed an agonist-induced down-regulation (decrease in B-max of labelled agonist and antagonist binding) and desensitisation (decrease in 5-HT-induced inositol phosphate formation and potency of 5-HT). Antagonist pre-treatment induced an increase in rat 5-HT2C receptor-mediated inositol phosphate formation as well as increased agonist and antagonist radioligand binding. These findings are consistent with the classical model of G-protein coupled receptor regulation. In contrast, the rat 5-HT2A receptor expressed in the same host cell behaved differently, unlike the classical model. Pre-treatment with 5-HT for 15 min and 48 h did not change receptor levels measured by radioligand binding, but the signal transduction response (inositol phosphate formation) was significantly reduced. Pre-treatment with the antagonist pipamperone for 15 min and 48 h caused an increase in antagonist radioligand binding but a reduction in agonist radioligand binding and a decrease in inositol phosphate formation and potency of 5-HT. Hence, the rat 5-HT2A receptor apparently undergoes agonist desensitisation without down-regulation of the total receptor number. Antagonist pre-treatment causes a paradoxical desensitisation, possibly by uncoupling of the receptor from G-proteins. The uncoupled receptor does not bind 5-HT in the nanomolar range but retains its antagonist binding properties. Paradoxical antagonist-induced desensitisation of rat 5-HT2A receptors has also been observed in vivo. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In radioligand, and [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays the CB receptor binding affinities and efficacies of the new ligands were determined. Furthermore, we used a ligand-based docking approach to validate the empirical observed results. In conclusion, several crucial structural requirements were identified. The most potent coumarins like 3-butyl-7-(1-butylcyclopentyl)-5-hydroxy-2H-chromen-2-one (36b, K-i CB2 13.7 nM, EC50 18 nM), 7-(1-butylcyclohexyl)-5-hydroxy-3-propyl-2H-chromen-2-one (39b, K-i CB2 6.5 nM, EC50 4.51 nM) showed a CB2 selective agonistic profile with low nanomolar affinities.

Single-agent PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy (PRLT) with the alpha-emitter Ac-225 showed promise against mCRPC but may cause severe and/or persistent xerostomia, which may substantially impair patients' quality-of-life. We hypothesized that when Lu-177-PSMA ligand alone is ineffective, tandem therapy with low-activity Ac-225-PSMA ligand plus full activity of the beta emitter may enhance efficacy while minimizing xerostomia severity. Methods We retrospectively analyzed pilot experience with 1 course of Ac-225-PSMA-617/Lu-177-PSMA-617 tandem therapy in our first 20 patients with mCRPC receiving this intervention after insufficiently responding to Lu-177-PSMA-617 monotherapy. This cohort had late-stage/end-stage disease with high baseline prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration (median 215 ng/mL), heavy pre-treatment (abiraterone and/or enzalutamide, and Lu-177-PRLT [median cumulative activity, 26.3 GBq] in 20/20 patients, 100%; docetaxel and/or cabazitaxel in 13/20 patients, 65%), and frequent Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2 (8/20 patients, 40%). Results Median (minimum-maximum) administered activities were Ac-225-PSMA-617, 5.3 (1.5-7.9) MBq, and Lu-177-PSMA-617, 6.9 (5.0-11.6) GBq. Significant responders to tandem therapy received Lu-177-PSMA-617 monotherapy as maintenance (median [minimum-maximum]: 1 [0-5] cycle). After a median (minimum-maximum) 22 (14-63) weeks' follow-up, 13/20 patients (65%) had as best biochemical response a PSA decline > 50%. Median (95% confidence interval) progression-free survival was 19 (12-26) weeks, and overall survival was 48 (4-92) weeks post-tandem therapy administration. Xerostomia was reported as grade 1 (very mild) in 8/20 patients (40%), grade 2 (mild) in 5/20 (25%), and grade 3/4 in 0/20. Conclusions Our results suggest that a single course of tandem therapy with low-activity Ac-225-PSMA-617/full-activity Lu-177-PSMA-617 may safely enhance response to PRLT in men with late-stage/end-stage mCRPC while minimizing xerostomia severity. Formal study of this combination is warranted.

The use of radiopharmaceuticals is a powerful tool in managing the patients with infectious diseases. In this study, ofloxacin as a second-generation fluoroquinolone has been labeled with [Tc-99m(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+) core to formulate a suitable infection imaging agent. Ofloxacin was radiolabeled with Tc-99m using carbonyl core. Radioligand chemical analysis involved HPLC methods. Radioconjugate stability and lipophilicity were determined. Binding with Staphylococcus aureus and biodistribution in infected mice for labeled compound were studied. The radioligand was characterized by HPLC, and its radiochemical purity was more than 90%. In vitro stability studies have shown the complex was stable at least 6h after labeling at room temperature. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient experiment exhibited logP=1.52 +/- 0.21 for Tc-99m(CO)(3)-ofloxacin. The complex showed specific binding to S.aureus. Biodistribution results showed that radioligand had high accumulation in the infected muscle in a mice (T/NT=2.02 +/- 0.12 at 4h postinjection). On the basis of stability and infection site uptake ratio, suitability of this complex as a radiotracer for imaging of infections is recognized.

In the first patient, PSMA-directed positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging was used for pr imary staging of high-r isk PCa before initial therapy. Then after biochemical relapse it was used to plan the scope of further treatment, in which it allowed among others to perform precise target volume delineation for salvage radiotherapy for pathologic lymph nodes. In the second patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), PSMA-guided imaging played a key role in the qualification for PSMA-directed radioligand therapy (RLT) with lutetium-177. We also present a review of the current literature concerning PSMA theranostics in the 2 clinical settings, ie, primary staging of PCa and PSMA RLT of mCRPC.

The methodology was applied to sera from 85 young type 1 and 98 adult-onset diabetic patients with different marker profiles and insulin requirements, and to 53 normal control sera. Among type 1 diabetes sera used as autoimmunity controls, 100% of those with at least one positive marker by single methods and 17.7% of those with double negative markers were positive by RBA-combi (RBA-combi+). Among sera from adult-onset diabetes, 100% of those PAA+ (GADA+ or GADA-), 92.3% of GADA+/PAA-, and 1.3% of GADA-/PAA- were RBA-combi+. In conclusion, the new RBA-combi allowed the simultaneous detection of GADA and PAA markers with acceptable performance. Moreover, 16 out of 18 (88.9%) of adult patients RBA-combi+ evolved to insulin requirement, suggesting that this test is a valuable tool for assessing autoimmune processes associated to future impairment of insulin secretion.

Synthesis and pharmacological characterization of [<SUP>125</SUP>I]MRS5127, a high affinity, selective agonist radioligand for the A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nucleoside; G protein-coupled receptor; Adenosine receptor; Radioligand binding	RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; KAPPA-B; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; LIGANDS; TARGET; NUCLEOSIDES; DERIVATIVES; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; CARCINOMA	A recently reported selective agonist of the human A(3) adenosine receptor (hA(3)AR), MRS5127 (1'R,2'R,3'S,4'R,5'S)-4'-[2-chloro-6-(3-iodobenzylamino)-purine]-2',3'-O-dihydroxy-bicyclo-[3.1.0]hexane, was radioiodinated and characterized pharmacologically. It contains a rigid bicyclic ring system in place of a 5'-truncated ribose moiety, and was selected for radiolabeling due to its nanomolar binding affinity at both human and rat A(3)ARs. The radioiodination of the N-6-3-iodobenzyl substituent by iododestannylation of a 3-(trimethylstannyl)benzyl precursor was achieved in 73% yield, measured after purification by HPLC. [I-125]MRS5127 bound to the human A(3)AR expressed in membranes of stably transfected HEK 293 cells. Specific binding was saturable, competitive, and followed a one-site binding model, with a K-d value of 5.74 +/- 0.97 nM. At a concentration equivalent to its K-d, non-specific binding comprised 27 +/- 2% of total binding. In kinetic studies, [I-125]MRS5127 rapidly associated with the hA(3)AR (t(1/2) =0.514 +/- 0.014 min), and the affinity calculated from association and dissociation rate constants was 3.50 +/- 1.46 nM. The pharmacological profile of ligands in competition experiments with [I-125]MRS5127 was consistent with the known structure-activity-relationship profile of the hA(3)AR. [I-125]MRS5127 bound with similar high affinity (K-d, nM) to recombinant A(3)ARs from mouse (4.90 +/- 0.77), rabbit (2.53 +/- 0.11), and dog (3.35 +/- 0.54). For all of the species tested, MRS5127 exhibited A(3)AR agonist activity based on negative coupling to cAMP production. Thus, [I-125]MRS5127 represents a new species-independent agonist radioligand for the A3AR. The major advantage of [I-125]MRS5127 compared with previously used A(3)AR radioligands is its high affinity, low degree of non-specific binding, and improved A(3)AR selectivity.

Previously developed methods for biotoxin surveillance in the environment and seafood include analytical methods and in vivo and in vitro bioassays. The radioligand receptor binding assay (r-RBA) is among the in vitro methodologies currently used for the detection and quantification of marine biotoxins. For the ciguatoxin group, the r-RBA has been widely used as a means to characterize the mode of action and as detection method in various biological matrices. Yet, screening methods have not been standardized, and the details of the ciguatoxin-specific r-RBA are not well documented, which limit interlaboratory comparison and progress toward method validation. This work presents the development of an optimized r-RBA for ciguatoxins and provides guidance on its use and quality control checks for analysis of environmental samples. We focus on the analysis of critical parameters involved in determining assay acceptability. Calculation of toxin concentrations in fish samples is illustrated with four examples. Thus, this paper provides the detailed information required for a full validation of the r-RBA, a necessary step toward the development and implementation of a regulatory monitoring programme for ciguatoxins in seafood products using the r-RBA.

In this study, we investigated PSMA upregulation by enzalutamide, an established androgen axis drug, in a cohort (n = 30) of patients with advanced, metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Our results show that short-term enzalutamide medication significantly increases PSMA expression in patients with mCRPC. Therefore, enzalutamide may provide a potential enhancer medication for PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy. In this study, we investigated upregulation of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) by enzalutamide in a cohort (n = 30) of patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients were examined by [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT pre- and post-enzalutamide medication (mean 13 +/- 7 days). Imaging results were compared based on quantification of whole-body PSMA tumor burden: total lesion PSMA (TLP) and normalized TLP values to liver (TLP-LR) and to parotid gland (TLP-PR). In addition, lesion-based analyses were performed. The median (mean) increases in TLP, TLP-LR and TLP-PR after enzalutamide medication were 10.1% (20.2%), 29.5% (34.8%) and 27.6% (24.4%), respectively. These increases were statistically significant (p = 0.002, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001), while prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum values did not change significantly (p = 0.483). The increase was independent of prior patient exposure to enzalutamide. SUVmax increased substantially (>10%) in 49.6% of target lesions. The relative change was significantly higher in the subgroup of lesions with SUVmax < 10 (p < 0.001). In conclusion, short-term enzalutamide medication significantly increases PSMA expression in patients with mCRPC, irrespective of prior enzalutamide exposure. The relative PSMA upregulation effect seems to be more pronounced in lesions with only moderate baseline PSMA expression. Enzalutamide may provide a potential enhancer medication for PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy.

A suitable radiolabeled alpha(7)nAChR PET tracer would be important for in vivo quantification of alpha(7)nAChR binding in humans and to measure alpha(7)nAChR occupancy of alpha(7)nAChR drug candidates. Here, we present the radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of C-11-NS14492 as a selective alpha(7)nAChR PET radioligand. Methods: The high-affinity alpha(7)nAChR-selective partial agonist NS14492 was radiolabeled by methylation of its desmethyl precursor using C-11-methyl triflate. Female Danish Landrace pigs were studied at baseline and after intravenous administration of blocking doses of either the alpha(7)nAChR partial agonist SSR180711 or the unlabeled NS14492. C-11-NS14492 was given as an intravenous bolus injection, and the pigs were scanned for 90 min both at baseline and in the blocked conditions. Arterial blood was collected during the scanning, plasma was counted, and parent compound fraction was determined with radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. PET data were quantified with a graphical analysis with arterial input; C-11-NS14492 regional distribution volumes were calculated, and alpha(7)nAChR occupancy was determined using an occupancy plot. Results: C-11-NS14492 had a high uptake in the pig brain, with the highest binding in the cerebral cortex and thalamus in accordance with alpha(7)nAChR distribution. Pretreatment with NS14492 and SSR180711 consistently decreased distribution volumes of C-11-NS14492 in all examined regions, in a dose-dependent manner, supporting the finding that the radioligand binds selectively to alpha(7)nAChR in vivo. Conclusion: We report here that (11)-NS14492 is the first, to our knowledge, PET radioligand for alpha(7)nAChR showing a dose-dependent decline in cerebral binding after receptor blockade. This compound is considered a promising PET tracer for in vivo measurements of alpha(7)nAChR binding in the human brain.

Consensus within the framework of GKV-funded care between the university hospitals in Aachen, Bonn, Dusseldorf, Essen, and Cologne and the MDK Nordrhein	UROLOGE			German	Article						PSMA; Prostate cancer; Radionuclide therapy; Lu-177; Radioligand therapy	RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; LU-177-PSMA-617; CYCLES; PSMA	In the last 3 years, Lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy (Lu-177-PSMA-RLT) has received increasing attention in nuclear medicine as a new form of treatment for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer. This therapy combines the radionuclide Lutetium-177, which has been therapeutically used in nuclear medicine for many years, with a molecular target of the transmembrane prostate-specific membrane antigen expressed by prostate cancer cells. Since there are no prospective randomized studies on Lu-177-PSMA-RLT and the question of reimbursement has repeatedly been the subject of review by the MDK Nordrhein (Medischenische Dienst der Krankenversicherung), there was a desire because of the increasing number of patients being treated to clarify under which circumstances Lu-177-PSMA-RLT can be reimbursed by German statutory health insurance. The goals of this article are to help treating physicians understand how this new therapy option works, to integrate it in the overall therapy concept for castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer, and, above all, to use Lu-177-PSMA-RLT-based on the current data-at the right place in the therapy sequence of castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.

In the first step, a Kryptofix 222-assisted F-18 nucleophilic heteroaromatic substitution in 6-nitro-3-((1-tert-butoxycarbonyl-2(S)-azetidinyl)methoxy)pyridine provided a radio-fluorinated Boc-protected intermediate. Subsequent acidic deprotection of the intermediate gave [F-18](1) under bar with an overall radiochemical yield of 8 to 12% (non-decay-corrected). The typical synthesis time was ca. 110 min. Specific radioactivity of the final product ranged from 1000 to 4500 mCi/mu mol, as calculated at the end-of-synthesis. III vitro studies demonstrated that the novel radioligand bound to a single population of sites in rat brain membranes, presumably, to the alpha 4 beta 2 subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. This binding was characterized by a K-d value of 28 pM, consistent with the K-i value of 25 pM, derived previously for unlabeled (1) under bar in competition assays with (+/-)-[H-3]epibatidine.

As this gene family has become the target of novel therapeutic development, the analysis of these receptors requires radioligand binding techniques as well as methods that entail assessing receptor stimulation of signal transduction pathways. Herein, we describe specific protocols for measuring radiolabeled chemokine binding to their cognate receptors on cultured glial cells as well as to receptors expressed in heterologous cell systems. Multiple downstream signaling pathways, including intracellular calcium influx and receptor-dependent kinase activation, are associated with chemokine receptor stimulation. Protocols for measuring these signaling events in chemokine-receptor-expressing cells are also presented. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

After the introduction of enzalutamide medication, all patients showed a PSA decrease (7/10 patients with partial remission). This pilot experience suggests the synergistic potential of adding enzalutamide to PSMA-RLT derived from the intra-individual comparison of Lu-177-based PSMA-RLT +/- enzalutamide. Well-received strong efficacy of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) does not prevent patients from either early or eventual disease progression under this treatment. In this study, we investigated co-medication with enzalutamide as a potential re-sensitizer for PSMA-RLT in patients with imminent treatment failure on standard Lu-177-based PSMA-RLT. Ten mCRPC patients who exhibited an insufficient response to conventional [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT received oral medication of enzalutamide 160 mg/d as an adjunct to continued PSMA-RLT. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and standard toxicity screening lab work-up were performed to assess the treatment efficacy and safety in these individuals. The mean PSA increase under PSMA-RLT before starting the re-sensitizing procedure was 22.4 +/- 26.5%. After the introduction of enzalutamide medication, all patients experienced a PSA decrease, -43.4 +/- 20.0% and -48.2 +/- 39.0%, after one and two cycles of enzalutamide-augmented PSMA-RLT, respectively. A total of 70% of patients (7/10) experienced partial remission, with a median best PSA response of -62%. Moreover, 5/6 enzalutamide-naive patients and 2/4 patients who had previously failed enzalutamide exhibited a partial remission. There was no relevant enzalutamide-induced toxicity observed in this small cohort. This pilot experience suggests the synergistic potential of adding enzalutamide to PSMA-RLT derived from the intra-individual comparison of Lu-177-based PSMA-RLT +/- enzalutamide.

Physiological and pharmacological studies suggest that hyperactivation of brain AT(1) angiotensin receptors is a major pathophysiological factor. Consistent with these observations, radioligand binding studies indicate widespread up-regulation of brain angiotensin receptors in SHR. One key brainstem site in which AT(1) receptor stimulation appears to contribute to the elevated blood pressure in SHR is the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). However, no quantitative comparison of AT(1) receptor binding in the RVLM has been made in SHR versus normotensive rats. A novel, non-AT(1), non-AT(2) binding site, specific for angiotensins II and III, has recently been discovered in the brain. To determine if radioligand binding to either AT(1) receptors or this novel angiotensin binding site is altered in the RVLM and other caudal brainstem regions of SHR, a quantitative densitometric autoradiographic comparison of radioligand binding in SHR versus normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats was made. In both the RVLM and caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) as well as dorsomedial medulla (DMM), there was increased expression of AT(1) receptor binding in SHR (13%, 9%, and 23%, respectively). Conversely, expression of the novel, non-AT(1), non-AT(2), angiotensin II and HI binding site was decreased in the RVLM and DMM of SHR (37% and 13%, respectively). This increased AT(1) receptor binding in the RVLM may contribute to the hypertension of SHR. Reduced radioligand binding to the novel, non-AT(1), non-AT(2), angiotensin binding site in the RVLM of SHR may indicate a role for this binding site to reduce blood pressure via its interactions with angiotensins II and III.

Here we report the synthesis of a novel PET radioligand, [(11)C]AZ10419369 (5-methyl-8-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide), for in vivo visualization of 5-HT1B receptors in the brains of macaques and humans subjects. [(11)C]AZ10419369 was prepared by N-methylation of (8-(1-piperazinyl)5- methylchrom-2-en-4-one-2-(4-morpholinophenyl) carboxamide, using carbon-11 methyl triflate. Regional brain uptake patterns of [(11)C]AZ10419369 were characterized by PET measurements in two macaques and a preliminary study in two human subjects. In addition, AZ10419369 was prepared in tritium labeled form for in vitro autoradiography studies in macaque brain tissue sections. The radiochemical purity of [(11)C]AZ10419369 was >99% and specific radioactivity was >3600 Ci/ mmol. After iv injection of [(11)C]AZ10419369, 3-4% was in brain after 7.5 min. The regional brain distribution of radioactivity was similar in humans and macaques showing the highest uptake of radioactivity in the occipital cortex and the basal ganglia, in accord with autoradiographic studies performed using [(3)H]AZ10419369. Uptake was moderate in the temporal and frontal cortical regions, lower in the thalamus and lowest in the cerebellum. In macaques pre-treated with the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist, AR-A000002, binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with specific binding to 5-HT(1B) receptors. These data support [11C] AZ10419369 as a suitable radioligand for labeling 5-HT(1B) receptors in the primate brain. This radioligand may be useful in future studies evaluating drug-induced receptor occupancy and measurement of brain 5-HT1B receptor levels in patients with psychiatric disorders.

Herein, we describe an C-11-labeled PET radiotracer based on 1-(4-chlorophenethyl)-6-methoxy-2-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-7-ol, Ro04-5595. The radiotracer was evaluated in rats using PET. The PET study showed a good pharmacokinetic profile with rapid uptake and washout over 90 min. Complementary high-resolution autoradiographic images using [H-3]Ro04-5595 demonstrated strong binding in NR2B receptor-rich regions and low binding in cerebellum where NR2B concentration is low.

This article wilt review commonly used modeling solutions for reversible positron-emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radioligands, with an emphasis on noninvasive methods. All of the modeling approaches in PET and SPECT assume a compartmental system nd derive parameters that describe the compartmental system. These parameters will be defined,; and their relationship to analogous parameters in pharmacology will be discussed. Then the major approaches are presented under the categories of graphical or mathematical as well as invasive or noninvasive.

Traditionally, binding assays to detect adenosine 2a (A2a) antagonists and agonists have used filtration methods that are cumbersome to run and not amenable to HTS. We developed scintillation proximity assays (SPA(TM)) utilizing HEK293 RBHA2AM cell membranes, either wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-coated yttrium silicate (YSi) or red-shifted yttrium oxide (YO) beads and the A2a-selective radioligand [H-3]SCH 58261. Both beads gave windows (total binding/nonspecific binding) of >5 and K-d values of 2-3 nM for the radioligand, in agreement with results obtained by filtration. In contrast, WGA-polyvinyltoluene as well as other bead types had windows of <3 and significant radioligand binding to the uncoated beads. A 384-well WGA-YO bead SPA was optimized utilizing a LEADseeker(TM) imaging system and an automated trituration process for dispensing the dense yttrium-based beads. Signals were stable after 4 h, and Z' values were 0.7-0.8. The LEADseeker imaging assay tolerated 2% dimethyl sulfoxide and generated IC50 values of 3-5 nM for the A2a antagonist CGS 15943, comparable to that obtained by the filtration method. A number of adenosine and xanthine analogues were identified as hits in the Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC). This imaging-based A2a SPA enables HTS and is a major improvement over the filtration method.

The results indicate that there are allosteric interactions across the receptor-receptor interface of homo-and heteroreceptor complexes that modulate the binding properties of their receptor protomer components in terms of affinity and density, and thereby change their pharmacology. In the adenosine A2A-dopamine D2 heteroreceptor complexes (A2AR-D2R), the activation of the A2AR protomer by its standard receptor agonist CGS21680 causes a conformational change in the A2AR-D2R heteroreceptor complex. The allosteric wave passes over the receptor interface, invades the orthostatic dopamine binding site of the dopamine D2R protomer, and reduces the affinity of the high but not the low affinity D2R agonist binding site. In view of the complex nature of allosteric mechanisms, the detection, analysis, and quantification of the effects of this phenomenon rely on the use of competition radioligand binding assays to ensure proper demonstration of the high and low affinity D2R agonist binding sites. Outlined in this chapter is simple but useful experimental approaches for measuring the allosteric receptor-receptor interactions at GPCR heteroreceptor complexes. The readers will also find tips and discussion on the pitfalls of these assay and instructions for data analysis.

The cerebral uptake and binding of the novel 5-HT4 receptor radioligand [C-11]SB207145 in vivo was modelled and the outcome compared with postmortem receptor binding. Different models for quantification of [11C] SB207145 binding were evaluated: One-tissue and two-tissue compartment kinetic modelling, Logan arterial input, and three different reference tissue models. We report that the pig autoradiographic 5-HT4 receptor distribution resembles the human 5-HT4 receptor distribution with the highest binding in the striatum and no detectable binding in the cerebellum. We found that in the minipig brain [11C] SB207145 follows one-tissue compartment kinetics, and the simplified reference tissue model provides stable and precise estimates of the binding potential in all regions. The binding potentials calculated for striatum, midbrain, and cortex from the PET data were highly correlated with 5-HT4 receptor concentrations determined in brain homogenates from the same regions, except for hippocampus where PET-measurements significantly underestimate the 5-HT4 receptor binding, probably because of partial volume effects. This study validates the use of [11C] SB207145 as a promising PET radioligand for in vivo brain imaging of the 5-HT4 receptor in humans.

Here, we investigate the use of an image-derived arterial input function and the cerebellum for kinetic analysis of radioligand binding in mice. Two radioligands were explored: 2-[18F]FA85380 (2-FA), displaying similar pKa and binding affinity to the smoking cessation drug varenicline (Chantix), and [18F]Nifene, displaying similar pKa and binding affinity to nicotine. Time-activity curves of the left ventricle of the heart displayed similar distribution across wild type mice, mice lacking the beta 2-subunit for ligand binding, and acute nicotine-treated mice, whereas reference tissue binding displayed high variation between groups. Binding potential estimated from a two-tissue compartment model fit of the data with the image-derived input function were higher than estimates from reference tissue-based estimations. Rate constants of radioligand dissociation were very slow for 2-FA and very fast for Nifene. We conclude that using an image-derived input function for kinetic modeling of nicotinic PET ligands provides suitable results compared to reference tissue-based methods and that the chemical properties of 2-FA and Nifene are suitable to study receptor response to nicotine addiction and smoking cessation therapies.

Moreover, 8-(4-(4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazine-1-sulfonyl)phenyl)-1-propylxanthine (35, PSB-603) was developed as an A(2B)-specific antagonist exhibiting a Ki value of 0.553 nM at the human A2B receptor and virtually no affinity for the human and rat A(1) and A(2A) and the human A(3) receptors up to a concentration of 10 mu M. A tritiated form of the compound was prepared as a new radioligand and characterized in kinetic, saturation, and competition studies. It was shown to be a useful pharmacological tool for the selective labeling of human as well as rodent A(2B) receptors (K-D human A(2B) 0.403 nM, mouse A(2B) 0.351 nM).

Extended <i>N</i><SUP>6</SUP> substitution of rigid C2-arylethynyl nucleosides for exploring the role of extracellular loops in ligand recognition at the A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptor; Purines; Molecular modeling; Structure activity relationship; Radioligand binding; Adenylate cyclase	ADENINE NUCLEOSIDES; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RAT-BRAIN; AFFINITY; AGONISTS; POTENT; DRUGS	2-Arylethynyl-(N)-methanocarba adenosine 5'-methyluronamides containing rigid N-6-(trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl) and 2-phenylethynyl groups were synthesized as agonists for probing structural features of the A(3) adenosine receptor (AR). Radioligand binding confirmed A(3)AR selectivity and N-6-1S,2R stereoselectivity for one diastereomeric pair. The environment of receptor-bound, conformationally constrained N-6 groups was explored by docking to an A(3)AR homology model, indicating specific hydrophobic interactions with the second extracellular loop able to modulate the affinity profile. 2-Pyridylethynyl derivative 18 was administered orally in mice to reduce chronic neuropathic pain in the chronic constriction injury model.

The underlying molecular mechanism was subsequently determined by fluorescence imaging and radioligand binding experiments. The loss of righting reflex and locomotor activity results showed that both (+)-catharanthine and (-)-18-MC induce sedative effects at doses of 63 and 72 mg/kg in a sex-independent manner. At a lower dose (40 mg/kg), only (-)-18-MC induced anxiolytic-like activity in naive mice (elevated O-maze test), whereas both congeners were effective in mice under stressful/anxiogenic conditions (light/dark transition test) and in stressed/anxious mice (novelty-suppressed feeding test), where the latter effect lasted for 24 h. Coronaridine congeners did not block pentylenetetrazole-induced anxiogenic-like activity in mice. Considering that pentylenetetrazole inhibits GABAA receptors, this result supports a role for this receptor in the activity mediated by coronaridine congeners. Functional and radioligand binding results showed that coronaridine congeners interact with a site different from that for benzodiazepines, increasing GABAA receptor affinity for GABA. Our study showed that coronaridine congeners induce sedative and anxiolytic-like activity in naive and stressed/anxious mice in a sex-independent fashion, likely by a benzodiazepine-independent allosteric mechanism that increases GABAA receptor affinity for GABA.

The analysis revealed that in addition to specific dopaminergic binding a substantial part of the radioligand was bound irreversibly to heterogeneous populations of non-specific binding sites of these membranes. The specific binding of [H-3]NPA with dopamine receptors, determined from the differences of kinetic curves of total and non-specific binding, was fast, reversible, and revealed high affinity. The irreversible componentwas heterogeneous and seems to be related to oxidative degradation of the radioligand, as the rate of this process was substantially reduced by antioxidants like ascorbic acid and dithiothreitol.

For the last decade, C-11-(+)McN5652 has been the most promising PET agent for studying SERT in humans. However, this agent has some limitations. Recently, a new promising SERT PET radioligand, 3-C-11-amino4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenyisulfanyl)benzonitrile, has been reported. We recently reported the synthesis of a new F-18-labeled SERT PET radioligand, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-(18)Ffluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-F-18-ADAM), which may have advantages over C-11-labeled radioligands. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this newly developed 18F-labeled PET radioligand as a promising agent for studying SEPT in the living human brain. Methods: This agent was evaluated by studying its in vitro binding to different monoamine transporters, its in vivo biodistributions in rats, its integrity and pharmacologic profiles in rat brain, and its distribution in a female baboon brain. Results: In vitro binding assays showed that 4-F-ADAM displayed high affinity to SERT sites (inhibition constant = 0.081 nmol/L, using membrane preparations of LLC-PK1 cells expressing the specific transporter) and showed more than 1,000-and 28,000-fold selectivity for SERT over norepinephrine transporter and dopamine transporter, respectively. Biodistribution of 4-18F-ADAM in rats showed a high initial uptake and slow clearance in the brain (2.13%, 1.90%, and 0.95% injected dose per organ at 2, 30, and 60 min after intravenous injection, respectively), with the specific binding peaking at 2 h after injection (hypothalamus/cerebellurn = 12.49). The uptake in blood, muscle, lung, kidney, and liver was also initially high but cleared rapidly. The radioactivity in the femur increases with time for 4-F-18-ADAM, indicating that in vivo defluorination may occur. In vivo metabolism studies in rats showed that 4-F-18-ADAM was not metabolized in rat brain (>96% of radioactivity was recovered as parent compound at 1 In after injection). However, it metabolized rapidly in the blood. Less than 7% of the radioactivity recovered from plasma was the parent compound, with the majority of radioactivity in the plasma not extractable by ethyl acetate. Blocking studies showed significant decreases in the uptake of 4-F-18-ADAM in the brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, and striatum) where SERT concentrations are high when rats were pretreated with (+)McN5652 (2 mg/kg 5 min before intravenous injection of 4-F-18-ADAM). However, changes in the uptake of 4-F-18-ADAM in these brain regions were less significant when rats were pretreated with either methylphenidate or nisoxetine. The baboon study showed that uptake of 4-F-18-ADAM in the midbrain peaked at similar to1 h after injection and then declined slowly. The ratios of the radioactivity in the midbrain to that in the cerebellum (where the concentration of SERT is low) at 2 and 3 h after injection were 3.2 and 4.2, respectively. Conclusion: 4-F-18-ADAM is suitable as a PET radioligand for studying SERT in the living brain. Further characterization of this new radioligand in humans is warranted.

AZD2184, a new radioligand for high-contrast positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of A beta-deposits, has recently been developed and characterized in vitro and in rodents ex vivo. The objective of this study was to label AZD2184 with carbon-11, to perform in vivo characterization of [C-11]AZD2184 ([C-11]5) in the cynomolgus monkey brain as well as whole-body dosimetry, and to examine the metabolism of the labeled radioligand. [C-11]5 was prepared by a two-step radiosynthesis starting with the reaction of 5-(6-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)benzo[d]thiazol-2yl)pyridin-2-amine with [C-11]methyl iodide followed by deprotection using water. Four brain PET measurements in two cynomolgus monkeys and one whole-body PET measurement were performed with [C-11]5. There was a high and rapid brain uptake (2.2-3.4% of injected dose at 2 min). The distribution of brain radioactivity was fairly uniform, with early to late-brain concentration ratios (peak vs. 60 min) higher for [C-11]5 than ratios previously reported for [C-11]PIB (8.2 and 4.6, respectively). Based on the whole-body data, it was estimated that an effective dose in an adult male would be 6.2 mu Sv/MBq and thus would be safe from a radiation point of view for multiple scans within the same year. [C-11]5 shows binding characteristics, suggesting low levels of white-matter retention, and may thus provide improved contrast when compared with currently used PET radioligands for visualization of A beta-deposits. On the basis of the labeling chemistry and the results of the biological evaluation, we conclude that [C-11]5 should be useful for routine clinical studies. Synapse 64:733-741, 2010.

METHODS: Parallel saturation and inhibition studies were performed using well-characterised radioligand binding assays and a Brandel Cell Harvester. RESULTS: MgCl2 produced a concentration-dependent decrease (44%), whereas Gpp(NH)p increased [H-3]DPCPX binding (19%). In [H-3]DPCPX competition studies, agonist affinity was 1.5-14.6-fold higher and 4.6-10-fold lower in the presence of 10 mmol/L MgCl2 and 10 mumol/L Gpp(NH)p respectively; antagonist affinity was unaffected. The decrease in agonist affinity with increasing Gpp(NH)p concentrations was due to a reduction in the proportion of binding to the high affinity receptor state. In contrast to [H-3]DPCPX, MgCl2 produced a concentration-dependent increase (72%) and Gpp(NH)p a decrease (85%) in [H-3]CCPA binding. Using [H-3]CCPA, agonist affinities were 5-17-fold higher than those for [H-3]DPCPX, consistent with binding only to the high affinity receptor state. Agonist affinity was 1.3-10.5-fold higher and 2.4-4.7-fold lower on adding MgCl2 or Gpp(NH)p respectively; antagonist affinities were as for [H-3]DPCPX. CONCLUSION: The inconsistencies surrounding the effects of MgCl2 and guanine nucleotides on radioligand binding to adenosine A, receptors were systematically examined. The effects of MgCl2 and Gpp(NH)p on agonist binding to A, receptors are consistent with their roles in stimulating GTP-hydrolysis at the G-protein a-subunit and in blocking formation of the high affinity agonist-receptor-G protein complex.

We report a case of a 71-year-old male with PCa who underwent PSMA PET/CT for recurrence evaluation. The scan demonstrated [68 Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 uptake in the distal ileum. Retrospective enquiry revealed that the patient was a known case of Crohn's disease. This case highlights an uncommon finding of PSMA radioligand uptake in the distal small bowel (non-prostatic benign pathological uptake) in a patient with known Crohn's disease, which may be misinterpreted in the evaluation of PCa.

So far, various PSMA ligands have been developed for radiolabeling with radioisotopes such as Ga-68 or F-18 which can be used for specific visualization and diagnosis of PSMA-expressing PCa. In addition, PSMA ligands suitable for radiolabeling with I-131 or Lu-177 have become available to the clinics, allowing PSMA-based radioligand therapies. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the most frequently used PSMA ligands, their structural modifications, and the impact of those on clinical applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The radioligand was synthesized by reacting desmethyl-GSK1838705A with [C-11] CH3I using GE FX2MeI module in similar to 5% yield (EOS), >95% radiochemical purity and a specific activity of 2.5 +/- 0.5 Ci/lmol. MicroPET imaging in mice indicated that [C-11] GSK1838705A penetrated blood brain barrier (BBB) and showed retention of radiotracer in brain. The radioligand exhibited high uptake in U87MG cells with > 70% specific binding to IGF1R. Our experiments suggest that [C-11] GSK-1838705A can be a potential PET radiotracer for the in vivo quantification of IGF1R expression in GBM and other brain tumors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Binding of a tritiated inverse agonist to cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors is increased in patients with schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Cannabinoid; CB1; Schizophrenia; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; [H-3]MePPEP	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXPRESSION; DISORDER; DENSITY	This study sought to determine whether cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptor binding was altered in the postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of individuals with schizophrenia (schizophrenia; n = 47) compared to controls (n = 43). The CB1 receptor inverse agonist radioligand [H-3]MePPEP was used to measure specific binding to CB1 receptors. The specific binding of [H-3]MePPEP to CB1 receptors was 20% higher in patients with schizophrenia than in controls. Power analyses suggested that 53 subjects per group would be needed to detect a similar difference in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) and the structurally related inverse agonist radioligand [F-18]FMPEP-d(2) (80% statistical power, p<0.05).

The introduction of O-benzyl groups on the coclaurine molecule, which exhibits only adrenergic antagonist activity, led to the appearance of calcium channel blocking activity comparable to that of tetrandrine while retaining adrenolytic activity in the same concentration range. Contraction of aortal rings with noradrenaline or KCl was relaxed more potently by some of these coclaurine derivatives than by tetrandrine, suggesting leads for the development of novel antihypertensive drugs with a dual mechanism of action.

For In-111 labeling, the peptide synthesis was followed by conjugation with DOTA using pSCN-Bn-DOTA. The synthesized conjugate prepared at optimized conditions was purified with a reversed-phase semipreparative column using gradient of water: acetonitrile mixture. The molecular mass was confirmed by mass spectroscopy. The conjugated Triptorelin was labeled with 500-550 MBq of In-111 chloride (in 0.2 M HCl). The radiochemical purity of the product prepared under optimized conditions was about 98% (RTLC) and >95% (HPLC). The serum stability of the tracer was determined up to 24 h. The In-111-peptide chelate exhibits high stability. The binding affinity of Triptorelin peptide was determined in a binding assay for both human and rat GnRH receptors. For in vivo studies, In-111-peptide was injected intravenously via the tail vein to rats. In vitro radioligand binding assays were performed with GnRHR-expressing human cell lines using [I-125]Triptorelin as the standard radioligand.

Cryosections prepared from whole hemispheres have been successfully used for in vitro radioligand autoradiography, in situ hybridization histochemistry and histochemistry. Functional autoradiography using 5-HT1A receptor stimulated [S-35] GTP gammaS binding and volume rendering of images from radioligand autoradiography to describe the distribution of D-2/D-3 dopamine receptors in three dimensions are also discussed. A detailed characterization of the biochemical neuroanatomy of several neuronal components can thus be obtained simultaneously in all regions in the normal and diseased brain, resulting in an extensive information on the human brain morphology and biochemistry.

The cytotoxicity of trichosanthin was demonstrated by its selective inhibition of various choriocarcinoma cells. When Jar cells were treated with trichosanthin, the influx of calcium into the cells was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. When the distribution of trichosanthin-binding proteins on Jar cells was studied, two classes of binding sites for trichosanthin were shown by radioligand binding assay. Furthermore, the cytoplasmic membrane of Jar cells was biotinylated and the trichosanthin-binding proteins were isolated with trichosanthin-coupled Sepharose beads. Two protein bands with molecular masses of about 50 kDa and 60 kDa were revealed, further characterization of which should shed light on the mechanism of the selective cytotoxicity of trichosanthin to Jar cells.

Radioligand displacement assays were carried out using [H-3] oxotremorine-M and [H-3] pirenzepine on rat cortical tissue and [H-3] N-methylscopolamine on rat heart and submandibulary glands. Two alkynyloximes 15 and 18 had pirenzepine/oxotromorine M ratios which were indicative of muscarinic agonist Ind partial agonist activity, respectively. They were tested for their mnemonic effects in mice using the swimming escape task and found to attenuate scopolamine induced impairment of the task in mice at 2 mg/kg. The results show that the O-alkynyloxime moiety linked to aza-cycles of appropriate size and rigidity (for example quinuclidine and tropane) is a potentially useful muscarinic pharmacophore that can be exploited for the design of muscarinic agonists.

However, in addition to high affinity binding to CHRM3, [H-3]4-DAMP binds with low affinity to CHRM1 confounding the potential to discriminate between changes in these two muscarinic receptors. We have developed a [H-3]4-DAMP binding assay, optimised for measuring CHRM3 protein levels in the cortex, with minimal selectivity towards CHRM1. The selectivity of our assay towards CHRM3 was confirmed using recombinant receptor-expressing, cell lysate preparations. [H-3]4-DAMP binding levels were similar between wildtype and CHRM1 knockout mice, confirming that the amount of [H-3]4-DAMP binding to CHRM1 was negligible. We used this assay to measure CHRM3 protein levels in the frontal pole, obtained post-mortem from subjects with bipolar disorder (n = 15), major depressive disorder (n = 15) and matched controls (n = 20) and showed that [H-3]4-DAMP binding was not altered in either bipolar disorder or major depressive disorder. Western blotting confirmed that CHRM3 protein levels were unchanged in these subjects Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Direct use of the crude expression product in the RBA was not feasible because the protein failed to fold properly (or had incorrectly paired disulphide bridges) and purification was hindered by interfering by-products. A refolding protocol and a chromatographic procedure were devised that readily allowed production of purified and immunochemically competent S-35-labeled proinsulin. The new RBA was compared with the reference test, in which the tracer was standard I-125-insulin. The analysis included sera from 41 diabetic patients and 25 healthy controls. Twenty-six (63.4%) and 29 (70.7%) patients scored positive by RBA using S-35-PI and I-125-insulin, respectively. The methods showed a satisfactory correlation with r(2) = 0.77 and a slope not significantly different from unity (m =1.16+/-0.10; 95% confidence interval). Since the nuclide used in the assay is S-35, the procedure is compatible with standard assays for GADA and IA-2A, and thus may permit combined assays for the major early markers of autoimmune diabetes.

Specific binding of [H-3]17 beta-estradiol is higher in the membranes than in the cytosol. Specific binding of both ligands in the cytosolic fraction is higher in vernalized plants than in non-vernalized ones.

Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonists with potent antiplatelet activity	PLATELETS			English	Article						Adenosine A(2A) receptor; antiplatelet activity; cAMP; docking; platelet; radioligand binding	PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION; RESIDUAL PLATELET REACTIVITY; CLOPIDOGREL; THERAPY; ANTAGONISTS; DRUGS; DESENSITIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION; DERIVATIVES	Selected adenosine A(2A) receptor agonists (PSB-15826, PSB-12404, and PSB-16301) have been evaluated as new antiplatelet agents. In addition, radioligand-binding studies and receptor-docking experiments were performed in order to explain their differential biological effects on a molecular level. Among the tested adenosine derivatives, PSB-15826 was the most potent compound to inhibit platelet aggregation (EC50 0.32 +/- 0.05 mu mol/L) and platelet P-selectin cell-surface localization (EC50 0.062 +/- 0.2 mu mol/L), and to increase intraplatelets cAMP levels (EC50 0.24 +/- 0.01 mu mol/L). The compound was more active than CGS21680 (EC50 0.97 +/- 0.07 mu mol/L) and equipotent to NECA (EC50 0.31 +/- 0.05 mu mol/L) in platelet aggregation induced by ADP. In contrast to the results from cAMP assays, K-i values determined in radioligand-binding studies were not predictive of the A(2A) agonists' antiplatelet activity. Docking studies revealed the key molecular determinants of this new family of adenosine A(2A) receptor agonists: differences in activities are related to -stacking interactions between the ligands and the residue His264 in the extracellular loop of the adenosine A(2A) receptor which may result in increased residence times. In conclusion, these results provide an improved understanding of the requirements of antiplatelet adenosine A(2A) receptor agonists.

Mass spectrometry-based ligand binding assays on adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> receptors	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						MS binding; Mass spectrometry; Radioligand binding; Adenosine receptor; Deuteration	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; RESIDENCE TIME; KINETICS; AFFINITY	Conventional methods to measure ligand-receptor binding parameters typically require radiolabeled ligands as probes. Despite the robustness of radioligand binding assays, they carry inherent disadvantages in terms of safety precautions, expensive synthesis, special lab requirements, and waste disposal. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a method that can selectively detect ligands without the need of a label. The sensitivity of MS equipment increases progressively, and currently, it is possible to detect low ligand quantities that are usually found in ligand binding assays. We developed a label-free MS ligand binding (MS binding) assay on the adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors (A(1)AR and A(2A)AR), which are well-characterized members of the class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. Radioligand binding assays for both receptors are well established, and ample data is available to compare and evaluate the performance of an MS binding assay. 1,3-Dipropyl-8-cyclopentyl-xanthine (DPCPX) and 4-(2-((7-amino-2-(furan-2-yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]-[1,3,5]triazin-5-yl)amino)ethyl)phenol (ZM-241,385) are high-affinity ligands selective for the A(1)AR and A(2A)AR, respectively. To proof the feasibility of MS binding on the A(1)AR and A(2A)AR, we first developed an MS detection method for unlabeled DPCPX and ZM-241,385. To serve as internal standards, both compounds were also deuterium-labeled. Subsequently, we investigated whether the two unlabeled compounds could substitute for their radiolabeled counterparts as marker ligands in binding experiments, including saturation, displacement, dissociation, and competition association assays. Furthermore, we investigated the accuracy of these assays if the use of internal standards was excluded. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the MS binding assay, even in the absence of a deuterium-labeled internal standard, and provide great promise for the further development of label-free assays based on MS for other GPCRs.

Acute S-ketamine application does not alter cerebral [<SUP>18</SUP>F]altanserin binding:: a pilot PET study in humans	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION			English	Article						Ketamine induced model psychosis; [F-8]altanserin; [O-15]butanol; PET; 5-HT2A-receptor	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT2A RECEPTORS; HUMAN BRAIN; 5HT(2) RECEPTORS; F-18 ALTANSERIN; IN-VIVO; SEROTONIN; DOPAMINE; VOLUME; MODEL	Modeling short-term psychotic states with subanaesthetic doses of ketamine provides substantial experimental evidence in support of the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Ketamine exerts its pharmacological effects both directly via interactions with glutamate receptors and indirectly by stimulating presynaptic release of endogenous serotonin (5-HT). The aim of this feasibility study was to examine whether acute ketamine-induced 5-HT release interferes with the binding of the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) radioligand [F-18]altanserin and positron emission tomography (PET). Two subjects treated with ketamine and one subject treated with placebo underwent [F-18]altanserin PET at distribution equilibrium conditions. Robust physiological, psychopathological and cognitive effects were present at ketamine plasma concentrations exceeding 100 mu g/l during > 70min. Notwithstanding, we observed stable radioligand binding (changes +/- 95% CI of -1.0 +/- 1.6% and +4.1 +/- 1.8% versus -1.2 +/- 2.6%) in large cortical regions presenting high basal uptake of both, [F-18]altanserin and ketamine. Marginal decreases of 4% of radioligand binding were observed in the frontal lobe, and 8% in a posteriorily specified frontomesial subregion. This finding is not compatible with a specific radioligand displacement from 5-HT2AR which should occur proportionally throughout the whole brain. Instead, the spatial pattern of these minor reductions was congruent with ketamine-induced increases in cerebral blood flow observed in a previous study using [O-15]butanol PET. This may caused by accelerated clearance of unspecifically bound [F-18]altanserin from cerebral tissue with increased perfusion. In conclusion, this study suggests that [F-18]altanserin PET is not sensitive to acute neurotransmitter fluctuations under ketamine. Advantageously, the stability of [F-18]altanserin PET towards acute influences is a prerequisite for its future use to detect sub-acute and chronic effects of ketamine.

Each was labelled efficiently in its methyl group with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) as a prospective radioligand for imaging brain norepinephrine transporters (NET) with positron emission tomography (PET). The uptake and distribution of radioactivity in brain following intravenous injection of each radioligand into cynomolgus monkey was examined in vivo with PET. After injection of (R)-[C-11]OHDMI, the maximal whole brain uptake of radioactivity was very low (1.1% of injected dose; I.D.). For occipital cortex, thalamus, lower brainstem, mesencephalon and cerebellum, radioactivity ratios to striatum at 93 min after radioligand injection were 1.35, 1.35, 1.2, 1.2 and 1.0, respectively. After injection of [C-11]UMME, radioactivity readily entered brain (3.5% I.D.). Ratios of radioactivity to cerebellum at 93 min for thalamus, occipital cortex, region of locus coeruleus, mesencephalon and striatum were 1.35, 1.3, 1.3, 1.2 and 1.2, respectively. Radioactive metabolites in plasma were measured by radio-HPLC. (R)[C-11]OHDMI represented 75% of plasma radioactivity at 4 min after injection and 6% at 30 min. After injection of [C-11]UMME, 84% of the radioactivity in plasma represented parent at 4 min and 20% at 30 min. Since the two new hydroxylated radioligands provide only modest regional differentiation in brain uptake and form potentially troublesome lipophilic radioactive metabolites, they are concluded to be inferior to existing radioligands, such as (S,S)-[C-11]MeNER, (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 and (S,S)[F-18]FRB-D-4, for the study of brain NETs with PET in vivo.

The radiolabelled compound was prepared by reductive N-alkylation of its des-isopropyl precursor with [2-C-11]acetone. (+/-)-[C-11]ICI 118551 was obtained in greater than 98% radiochemical purity in 30 min with a radiochemical yield of 15 +/- 5% (non-decay corrected) and a specific radioactivity 2.5 +/- 0.5 Ci/mu mol. The biological evaluation of racemic erythro (+/-)-[C-11]ICI 118551 in rats and Macara Nemestrina shows a high radioactivity uptake in lung and heart. However, in both animal models no detectable displacement of lung radioactivity concentration was observed after pre-treatment with propranolol or ICI 118551, which indicates that in this organ, radioligand uptake is mostly due to non-specific binding. The biological data suggest that erythro (+/-)-[C-11]ICI 118551 is not adequate to be further developed as a tracer for beta(2) adrenergic receptor imaging in vivo. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Exploration of several chemical series gave four leads with high PDE4D inhibitory potency and selectivity, optimal lipophilicity, and good brain uptake. These leads featured alkoxypyridinyl cores. They were successfully labeled with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) for evaluation with PET in monkey. Whereas two of these radioligands did not provide PDE4D-specific signal in monkey brain, two others, [C-11]T1660 and [C-11]T1650, provided sizable specific signal, as judged by pharmacological challenge using rolipram or a selective PDE4D inhibitor (BPN14770) and subsequent biomathematical analysis. Specific binding was highest in prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus, regions that are important for cognitive function. [C-11]T1650 was progressed to evaluation in humans with PET, but the output measure of brain enzyme density (V-T) increased with scan duration. This instability over time suggests that radiometabolite(s) were accumulating in the brain. BPN14770 blocked PDE4D uptake in human brain after a single dose, but the percentage occupancy was difficult to estimate because of the unreliability of measuring V-T. Overall, these results show that imaging of PDE4D in primate brain is feasible but that further radioligand refinement is needed, most likely to avoid problematic radiometabolites.

In this work, it was set up a novel method to quantify the concentration of a promising anti-inflammatory agent inside and outside of intestinal barrier using the everted gut sac technique. The compound chosen for the present study is one of the most potent and selective A(3)AR agonist reported so far, named AR 170 (N-6-methyl-2-phenylethynyl-5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine). In order to evaluate the intestinal absorption of AR 170 the radioligand binding assay in comparison with HPLC-DAD was used. Results showed that the compound is absorbed via passive diffusion by paracellular pathway. The concentrations determined in the serosal (inside the sac) fluid by radioligand binding assay are in good agreement with those obtained through the widely used HPLC/MS protocol, demonstrating the reliability of the method. It is worthwhile to note that the radioligand binding assay allows detecting very low concentrations of analyte, thus offering an excellent tool to measure the intestinal absorption of receptor ligands. Moreover, the AR 170 quantity outside the gut sac and the interaction with A(3)AR could presuppose good topical anti-inflammatory effects of this compound.

However, experimental evidence for central effects of anisodamine is limited and conflicting compared with that of scopolamine. In the present study, Morris water maze test, long-term potentiation (LTP) recording and receptor radioligand binding assays were used to explore the disparity in neuropsychopharmacological influences of anisodamine versus scopolamine and possible mechanisms. Anisodamine, at 10-40-fold higher doses than those of scopolamine, did not produce any spatial cognitive deficits as scopolamine, but tended to improve cognition at the repeated high doses. LTP in vivo was then adopted to predict BBB permeability of the muscarinic antagonists following systemic drug administration. Contrary to scopolamine, anisodamine did not influence the formation of LTP in the CA, region of rat hippocampus at 40-fold higher dose than that of scopolamine. Additionally, receptor radioligand binding assays (RRLBA) revealed that the binding affinity of anisodamine to mice brain mAChR was much lower than that of scopolamine. The findings suggested that anisodamine did not impair cognition nor depress UP primarily due to its poor BBB permeability. This work enlarged knowledge of structure-activity relationship among tropane alkaloids, meanwhile providing evidence for more reasonable drug prescription in clinic. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Here, we identified a novel pyridopyrimidin-4- one analog, N-tert-butyl-2-[2-(6-C-11-methoxypyridine-2-yl)-6-[3(morpholin-4-yl) propoxy]-4-oxopyrido[2,3-d] pyrimidin-3(4H)-yl] acetamide (C-11-TASP0410699, hereafter referred to as C-11-TASP699), as a potent V1BR radioligand producing a higher image contrast for the target than C-11-TASP0434299. Methods: In vitro properties of TASP699 were assessed by assaying its affinity for human V1BR and its selectivity for off-target molecules. Radioactive uptake in the pituitary was analyzed using PET in rhesus monkeys after intravenous administration of C-11-TASP699. Serial doses of a selective V1BR antagonist, 2-[2-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-6-[3-(morpholin-4-yl) propoxy]-4-oxopyrido[2,3-d] pyrimidin-3(4H)yl]- N-isopropylacetamide hydrochloride (TASP0390325), were administered before the radioligand injection. Autoradiographic labeling of monkey pituitary slices with C-11-TASP699 was conducted with or without nonradioactive V1BR antagonists. Results: The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of TASP699 for human V(1B)Rs (0.165 nM) was lower than that of TASP0434299 (0.526 nM), whereas its IC50 values for off-target molecules exceeded 1 mu M. PET imaging in monkeys demonstrated that the peak pituitary uptake of C-11-TASP699 was almost equivalent to that of C-11-TASP0434299 and that pretreatment with TASP0390325 inhibited the retention of C-11-TASP699 in a dose-dependent manner, inducing nearly full occupancy at 0.3 mg/kg. Specific radioligand binding was determined as a specific-to-nondisplaceable uptake ratio at equilibrium using radioactivity retentions at 60 min in baseline and blocking studies. This ratio for C-11-TASP699 was approximately 2.5-fold greater than that of C-11-TASP0434299. A reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography study identified the parent and polar radiometabolites. Affinities of 2 predicted metabolite candidates for V(1B)Rs were more than 10 times weaker than that of the parent. Intense autoradiographic labeling of the anterior pituitary with C-11-TASP699 was inhibited with TASP0390325 in a concentration-dependent manner. Conclusion: C-11-TASP699 yielded PET images of pituitary V(1B)Rs with a higher contrast than C-11-TASP0434299, supporting the applicability of C-11-TASP699 in the assessment of neuropsychiatric diseases and dose findings for test drugs in clinical trials.

It was found that palladium acyl complexes may be prepared in a separate step and have sufficient lifetime to be used in a subsequent reaction with a nucleophile. This two-pot procedure was used for the labelling synthesis of eleven amides (nine of which are analogues of WAY-100635, a 5-HT1A radioligand) from weakly nucleophilic amines. The results were compared to a direct one-pot procedure using lithium amides. Both approaches extend the scope of palladium-mediated carbonylation using [11C]carbon monoxide and aryl iodides allowing use of weakly nucleophilic amines. ((C) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In the current study, we synthesized and evaluated a radiolabeled (iodine-125) analog of N-[N+S)-1,3-dicarboxypropyl]carbamoyl]-S-3-iodo-L-tyrosine (DCIT), a potent antagonist of GCPII activity. We examined the regional distribution of [I-125]DCIT binding in the rodent brain using quantitative autoradiography in order to confirm the validity of this radioligand as a marker of GCPII in the brain. The ultimate goal is to develop an imaging agent for assessing GCPII levels in the living brain. The specific binding of [I-125]DCIT to rat brain followed a regional distribution consistent with previous studies describing regional brain GCPII gene expression and activity. We found a modest rostrocaudal gradient in which specific binding of [I-125]DCIT to GCPII,was lowest in cortical regions, with increasing levels of binding in midbrain structures and high levels of binding in hindbrain and brainstem. Autoradiography of [I-125]DCIT in GCPII knockout and wild type mouse brain showed a gene-dose dependency confirming the selectivity of this radioligand for GCPII. We propose that [I-125]DCIT is a selective radioligand that can be used to quantify brain GCPII levels in vitro using quantitative autoradiography. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study aims to investigate the immunomodulatory effect (targeting-triggering-therapy) of Lu-177-DOTA-EB-cRGDfK (Lu-177-DER) and to optimize the therapeutic efficacy by combining targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) and ICB. Flow cytometry, immunofluorescence analysis, and RT-qPCR are conducted to confirm the change of PD-L1 expression. Tumor uptakes of Lu-177-DER in CT26 and MC38 colorectal tumor models are verified through single photon emission computed tomography imaging. Further, the radionuclide dose and the treatment schedule to optimize the therapeutic scheme are carefully titrated and the mechanism of the synergy between TRT and ICB is explored. The results demonstrate that PD-L1 expression is upregulated after irradiation of Lu-177. The combination of 9.25 MBq Lu-177-DER TRT with 200 mu g alpha PD-L1 immunotherapy significantly inhibits tumor growth and protects against tumor recurrence. It is also found that 4-h interval is an effective time window between radioligand administration and ICB therapy. In conclusion, a promising scheme for tumor immunotherapy is realized based on the sequential administration of integrin alpha(v)beta(3)-targeted radioligand and PD-L1 immune checkpoint blocker, emphasizing the potential of combining radiotheranostics with ICB for precision cancer therapy.

In the present study, we established a novel in vitro method for quantitative determination of the nuclear retinoid X receptors in rat liver. One type of high affinity and limited capacity RXR specific binding sites with the K-a value ranging from 1.011 to 1.727 x 10(9) l/mol and the B-max value ranging from 0.346 to 0.567 pmol/mg, was demonstrated. Maximal 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA) specific binding to nuclear retinoid X receptors was achieved at 20 degrees C, and the optimal incubation time for the 9cRA-RXR complex formation was 120 min. From a number of endocrine disruptors, tributyltins and triphenyltins are known as RXR ligands. Our data confirmed the property of tributyltin chloride or triphenyltin chloride to bind to a high affinity and limited capacity RXR binding sites. Described optimal conditions for ligand binding to RXR molecules enabled us to calculate maximal binding capacity (Bmax) and affinity (Ka) values. This study provides an original RXR radioligand binding assay that can be employed for investigation of novel RXR ligands that comprise both drugs and endocrine disruptors.

Radiodefluorination of 3-Fluoro-5-(2-(2-[<SUP>18</SUP>F](fluoromethyl)-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl)benzonitrile ([<SUP>18</SUP>F]SP203), a Radioligand for Imaging Brain Metabotropic Glutamate Subtype-5 Receptors with Positron Emission Tomography, Occurs by Glutathionylation in Rat Brain	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	55th Annual Conference of the American-Society-for-Mass-Spectrometry	JUN 03-07, 2007	Indianapolis, IN	Amer Soc Mass Spectrometry			IN-VITRO; 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; LIVER CYTOSOL; S-TRANSFERASE; DEFLUORINATION; IDENTIFICATION; ANTAGONIST; METABOLISM; MICE; FLUOROACETATE	Metabotropic glutamate subtype-5 receptors (mGluR5) are implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Positron emission tomography (PET) with a suitable radioligand may enable monitoring of regional brain mGluR5 density before and during treatments. We have developed a new radioligand, 3-fluoro-5-(2-(2[F-18](fluoromethyl)thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl) benzonitrile ([F-18]SP203), for imaging brain mGluR5 in monkey and human. In monkey, radioactivity was observed in bone, showing release of [F-18]fluoride ion from [F-18] SP203. This defluorination was not inhibited by disulfiram, a potent inhibitor of CYP2E1. PET confirmed bone uptake of radioactivity and therefore defluorination of [F-18] SP203 in rats. To understand the biochemical basis for defluorination, we administered [F-18] SP203 plus SP203 in rats for ex vivo analysis of metabolites. Radio-high-performance liquid chromatography detected [F-18] fluoride ion as a major radiometabolite in both brain extract and urine. Incubation of [F-18] SP203 with brain homogenate also generated this radiometabolite, whereas no metabolism was detected in whole blood in vitro. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the brain extract detected m/z 548 and 404 ions, assignable to the [M + H](+) of S-glutathione (SP203Glu) and N-acetyl-S-L-cysteine (SP203Nac) conjugates of SP203, respectively. In urine, only the [M + H](+) of SP203Nac was detected. Mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry and multi-stage mass spectrometry analyses of each metabolite yielded product ions consistent with its proposed structure, including the former fluoromethyl group as the site of conjugation. Metabolite structures were confirmed by similar analyses of SP203Glu and SP203Nac, prepared by glutathione S-transferase reaction and chemical synthesis, respectively. Thus, glutathionylation at the 2-fluoromethyl group is responsible for the radiodefluorination of [F-18] SP203 in rat. This study provides the first demonstration of glutathione-promoted radiodefluorination of a PET radioligand.	[Shetty, H.

Specific radioligands for the D-4 receptor may be useful to understand the function of the D-4 receptor and its correlations with various disorders. 2-(3-(4-(4-[F-18]Fluorobenzyl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)benzo[d]thiazole ([F-18]4) was synthesized through a one-pot two-step procedure with total yield 18.6% (decay corrected). The specific activity of the radioligand was 112 GBq/mu mol and its radiochemical purity was >95.0%. Its affinity and selectivity for dopamine D-2-like receptors were measured through in vitro receptor binding evaluation and the K-i value for the D-4 receptor was determined to be 2.9 +/- 0.2 nM, and its selectivity for the dopamine D-4 receptor is 709-fold versus D-2long receptor, 823-fold versus D-3 receptor. The partition coefficient (Log D) of it was determined to be 2.6 +/- 0.1 through octanol-water partition experiment. The ligand presents desirable combination of lipophilicity, affinity and selectivity for the dopamine D-4 receptor. The results suggested that the radioligand shows promises for the in vivo study of the dopamine D-4 receptor.

Characterization of 12 GnRH peptide agonists - a kinetic perspective	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; HORMONE RECEPTOR; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; NONPEPTIDE LIGAND; IN-VITRO; GONADOTROPIN; ANTAGONIST; DISSOCIATION; EFFICACY	Background and PurposeDrug-target residence time is an important, yet often overlooked, parameter in drug discovery. Multiple studies have proposed an increased residence time to be beneficial for improved drug efficacy and/or longer duration of action. Currently, there are many drugs on the market targeting the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor for the treatment of hormone-dependent diseases. Surprisingly, the kinetic receptor-binding parameters of these analogues have not yet been reported. Therefore, this project focused on determining the receptor-binding kinetics of 12 GnRH peptide agonists, including many marketed drugs. Experimental ApproachA novel radioligand-binding competition association assay was developed and optimized for the human GnRH receptor with the use of a radiolabelled peptide agonist, [I-125]-triptorelin. In addition to radioligand-binding studies, a homogeneous time-resolved FRET Tag-lite method was developed as an alternative assay for the same purpose. Key ResultsTwo novel competition association assays were successfully developed and applied to determine the kinetic receptor-binding characteristics of 12 high-affinity GnRH peptide agonists. Results obtained from both methods were highly correlated. Interestingly, the binding kinetics of the peptide agonists were more divergent than their affinities with residence times ranging from 5.6min (goserelin) to 125min (deslorelin). Conclusions and ImplicationsOur research provides new insights by incorporating kinetic, next to equilibrium, binding parameters in current research and development that can potentially improve future drug discovery targeting the GnRH receptor.

After long preincubations, the dissociation was slow, not monoexponential, and inversely related to the concentration of the unlabeled ligand, Apparently, the unlabeled ligand becomes able to associate with the receptor simultaneously with the already bound radioligand if the preincubation lasts for a long period, and to hinder radioligand dissociation. When the membranes were preincubated with [H-3]NMS and then exposed to benzilylcholine mustard (covalently binding specific ligand), [H-3]NMS dissociation was blocked in wild-type receptors, but not in mutated (D99N) M-1 receptors, Covalently binding [H-3]propylbenzilylcholine mustard detected substantially more binding sites than [H-3]NMS. The observations support a model in which the receptor binding domain has two tandemly arranged subsites for classical ligands, a peripheral one and a central one. Ligands bind to the peripheral subsite first (binding with lower affinity) and translocate to the central subsite (binding with higher affinity). The peripheral subsite of M-1 receptors may include Asp-99, Experimental data on [H-3]NMS and [H-3]QNB association and dissociation perfectly agree with the predictions of the tandem two site model.

PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						radioligand binding assay; octanol-water distribution coefficient; baclofen; P-glycoprotein; prodrug	AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTER; GLUCOSE-TRANSPORTER; DRUG; EXPRESSION; SYSTEM; RATS	Purpose. Distribution to the effect site is a prerequisite for the therapeutic effect and determined by physicochemical properties and affinities to inside- and outside-directed membrane transporters. Based on the hypothesis that lipophilic esters of the GABA-derivative baclofen have a higher affinity to brain tissue, baclofen esters ( methyl, ethyl, 1-propyl, 2-propyl, butyl) were studied regarding their penetration through the blood-brain barrier and their affinities to P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Methods. Octanol-water distribution coefficients ( D) served as lipophilicity parameters. Blood and brain concentrations of baclofen and its methyl ester were determined in vivo in rats following intraperitoneal administration. Affinities to P-gp were evaluated using a radioligand binding assay based on P-gp-overexpressing cells and [H-3]talinolol as radioligand. Results. Log D values for baclofen and ester derivatives were -0.96 (baclofen), 0.48 (methyl), 0.77 (ethyl), 1.31 (1- propyl), 1.27 (2-propyl), and 1.42 (butyl). In-vitro studies yielded negligible affinity of baclofen to P-gp, whereas IC50-values for the esters ranged between 1300 muM (methyl) and 290 muM (2-propyl). Affinity parameters correlated well with the lipophilicity parameters. Conclusions. Despite the P-gp affinity, brain concentrations of methyl ester were significantly higher than those of baclofen, however, baclofen levels following administration of the ester were smaller than with baclofen administration indicating only partial hydrolysis.

The most promising compounds seem to be the appropriate aminoalkanolic derivatives of 6-chloroxanthone, among which the R-(-) and S-(+)-2amino-1-propanol derivatives of 6-chloro-2-methylxanthone (2(a) and 2(b)) displayed anti-MES activity (in mice) with a protective index (TD50/ED50) of 6.23 < 6.85, corresponding to that of phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. The most active compound, 2(b), was determined to have an affinity to the benzodiazepine (BDZ) receptor and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) by using radioligand binding assays. The enantiomeric purities of 2(a) and 2(b) were determined using an analytical liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It displays over 100 fold selectivity for the 5-HT6 receptor over all other 5-HT receptors tested so far. SB-258585 has been radiolabelled, to high specific activity, for its characterization as a 5-HT6 receptor selective radioligand. 2 [I-125]-SB-258585 bound, with high affinity, to a single population of receptors in a cell line expressing human recombinant 5-HT6 receptors. Kinetic and saturation binding experiments gave pK(D) values of 9.01+/-0.09 and 9.09+/-0.02, respectively. 3 In membranes derived from rat or pig striatum and human caudate putamen, [I-125]-SB-258585 labelled a single site with high levels (>60%) of specific binding. Saturation analysis revealed pK(D) values of 8.56+/-0.07 for rat, 8.60+/-0.10 for pig and 8.90+/-0.02 for human. B-max values for the tissues ranged from 173+/-23 and 181+/-25 fmol mg(-1) protein in rat and pig striatum, respectively, to 215+/-41 fmol mg(-1) protein in human caudate putamen. 4 The pK(i) rank order of potency for a number of compounds, determined in competition binding assays with [I-125]-SB-258585, at human caudate putamen membranes was: SB-271046 > SB-258585 > SB-214111 > methiothepin > clozapine > 5-Me-OT > 5-HT > Po 04-6790 > mianserin > ritanserin = amitriptyline > 5-CT > mesulergine. Similar profiles were obtained from pig and rat striatal membranes and recombinant 5-HT6 receptors; data from the latter correlated well with [H-3]-LSD binding. 5 Thus, [I-125]-SB-258585 is a high affinity, selective radioligand which can be used to label both recombinant and native 5-HT6 receptors and will facilitate further characterization of this receptor subtype in animal and human tissues.

Quantification of green fluorescent protein-(GFP-) tagged membrane proteins by capillary gel electrophoresis	ANALYST			English	Article							LASER-INDUCED FLUORESCENCE; RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; GENE-EXPRESSION; IN-VITRO; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; CELLS; AUTOPHAGY; SAMPLES; SITE	A fast and robust procedure for the quantification of GFP-tagged membrane proteins in cell homogenates was developed employing capillary gel electrophoresis coupled to laser-induced fluorescence detection (CGE-LIF). The new method was found to be highly sensitive and applicable to structurally diverse membrane proteins including synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A), adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR), and connexin 43 (Cx43). Quantification of SV2A and A2AAR using radioligand binding assays confirmed the results obtained with CGE-LIF. The CGE-LIF method showed significantly higher sensitivity as compared to fluorimetric measurement in a microplate. Importantly, CGE-LIF involves separation of the target proteins and their degradation products prior to quantification and thereby ensures specificity. We anticipate broad applicability of the method for any fluorophore-tagged protein.

Similarly, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (1-5 mu M), but not a mixture of phospholipids, induced an increase of GABA(A) receptors in synaptosomes. Furthermore, N-ethyl maleimide, an inactivator of the sensitive fusion protein, which interacts with GABA(A) receptor, abolished the receptor increase induced by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate. Together, the results suggest that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, acts via microfilament depolymerization increasing the binding of the radioligand to receptors possibly by modulation of their interaction with proteins involved in trafficking and docking mechanisms.

A positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for an allosteric site of mGlu(4) may provide evidence that a clinical drug candidate reaches and binds the target. A carbon-11-labeled PET radioligand binding an allosteric site of mGlu(4), [C-11]PXT012253, has been recently developed. Here, we describe the detailed characterization of this novel radiolabeled mGlu(4) ligand in nonhuman primates.Procedures[C-11]PXT012253 binding in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys, under the baseline and blocking conditions with the structurally different mGlu(4) allosteric ligand PXT002331, currently in clinical trials for Parkinson's disease, was quantified with compartment and graphical modeling approaches using a radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. Whole-body biodistribution of [C-11]PXT012253 was then assessed using PET/x-ray computed tomography to estimate the human effective doses of [C-11]PXT012253 for further clinical studies.Results[C-11]PXT012253 displayed binding in mGlu(4)-expressing regions in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys. Brain regional time-activity curves of [C-11]PXT012253 were well described in the two-tissue compartment model (2TC). Total distribution volume was stably estimated using Logan plot and multilinear analysis (MA1) although 2TC showed unstable values in some cases. Competition with PXT002331 showed high specific binding in the total distribution volume. Whole-body PET showed high accumulation of [C-11]PXT012253 in the liver, kidney, heart, and brain in the initial phase. The radioligand was excreted through both the gastrointestinal and the urinary tracts. Effective dose of [C-11]PXT012253 was estimated to be 0.0042mSv/MBq.Conclusions[C-11]PXT012253 was shown to be a promising PET radioligand for mGlu(4) allosteric modulators in the monkey brain. MA1 would be the choice of quantitative method. Further development of [C-11]PXT012253 in human subjects is warranted.

The biodistribution by positron emission tomography (PET) in baboons and the in vitro and in vivo metabolism of [F-18] DPA-714 were investigated in rats, baboons, and humans. Whole-body PET experiments showed a high uptake of radioactivity in the kidneys, heart, liver, and gallbladder. The liver was a major route of elimination of [F-18] DPA-714, and urine was a route of excretion for radiometabolites. In rat and baboon plasma, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) metabolic profiles showed three major radiometabolites accounting for 85% and 89% of total radioactivity at 120 minutes after injection, respectively. Rat microsomal incubations and analyses by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) identified seven metabolites, characterized as O-deethyl, hydroxyl, and N-deethyl derivatives of nonradioactive DPA-714, two of them having the same retention times than those detected in rat and baboon plasma. The third plasma radiometabolite was suggested to be a carboxylic acid compound that accounted for 15% of the rat brain radioactivity. O-deethylation led to a nonradioactive compound and [18F] fluoroacetic acid. Human CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 were shown to be involved in the oxidation of the radioligand. Finally an easy, rapid, and accurate method-indispensable for PET quantitative clinical studies-for quantifying [F-18] DPA-714 by solid-phase extraction was developed. In vivo, an extensive metabolism of [F-18] DPA-714 was observed in rats and baboons, identified as [F-18] deethyl, [F-18] hydroxyl, and [F-18] carboxylic acid derivatives of [F-18] DPA-714. The main route of excretion of the unchanged radioligand in baboons was hepatobiliary while that of radiometabolites was the urinary system.

However, men with low PSMA expression are excluded from RLT. We explored the effect of androgen receptor blockade with enzalutamide on PSMA expression. Assessment of PSMA and androgen receptor (AR) expression on the human PC cell lines 22Rv1, C4-2, and LNCaP by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry revealed low (22Rv1) and high (C4-2 and LNCaP) PSMA expression, and high, comparable AR positivity. Treatment with enzalutamide increased PSMA levels in 22Rv1, C4-2, and LNCaP (2.2/2.3/2.6-fold, p = 0.0005/0.03/0.046) after one week compared to DMSO-treated controls as assessed by flow cytometry. NOD/Scid mice bearing 22Rv1 tumors were treated with enzalutamide for two weeks. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) demonstrated higher tumor uptake of Ga-68-PSMA after enzalutamide treatment (p = 0.004). Similarly, a clinical case with low baseline PSMA avidity demonstrated increased uptake of Ga-68-PSMA after enzalutamide on PET/CT and post-therapeutic Lu-177-PSMA scintigraphy in a patient with mCRPC. Enzalutamide induced PSMA expression in the 22Rv1 xenograft model and in an mCRPC patient, both with low baseline tumoral PSMA levels. Therefore, enzalutamide pre-treatment might render patients with low PSMA expression eligible for Lu-177-PSMA RLT.

Case Report: Long-term complete response to PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy and abiraterone in a metastatic prostate cancer patient	FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY			English	Article						case report; PSMA; radioligand therapy; prostate cancer; metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer; Lu-PSMA-617; theranostics	INCREASED SURVIVAL; NEUROBLASTOMA; GLUTAMATE; TAILOR	Despite decades of research and clinical trials, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains incurable and typically fatal. Current treatments may provide modest increases in progression-free survival but can come with significant adverse effects and are disaggregated from the diagnostic imaging needed to fully assess the spread of metastatic disease. A theranostic approach, using radiolabeled ligands that target the cell surface protein PSMA, simplifies the visualization and disease treatment process by enabling both to use similar agents. Here, we describe an exemplary case wherein a gentleman in his 70s with mCRPC on diagnosis was treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 and abiraterone, and remains disease-free to date, over five years later.

On the basis of sex: male vs. female rat adenosine A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2A</sub> receptor affinity	BMC RESEARCH NOTES			English	Article						Sex differences; Rat adenosine A(1); A(2A) receptors; Radioligand binding assays	RADIOLIGAND BINDING; PARTIAL AGONISTS; ANTAGONISTS; A(1); A1; 8-CYCLOPENTYL-1,3-DIPROPYLXANTHINE; DERIVATIVES; INHIBITION; INCLUSION; PRINCIPLE	ObjectiveTo ensure reproducibility in biomedical research, the biological variable sex must be reported; yet a reason for using male (instead of female) rodents is seldom given. In our search for novel adenosine receptor ligands, our research group routinely determines a test compound's binding affinities at male Sprague-Dawley rat (r) adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors via in vitro radioligand binding studies. This pilot study compared the binding affinities of four adenosine receptor ligands (frequently used as reference standards) at male and female adenosine rA(1) and rA(2A) receptors.ResultsThe inhibition constant (K-i) values determined using female rats correspond well to the values obtained using male rats and no markable difference could be observed in affinity and selectivity of reference standards. For example, DPCPX the selective adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist: male rA(1)K(i): 0.5 & PLUSMN; 0.1 nM versus female rA(1)K(i): 0.5 & PLUSMN; 0.03 nM; male rA(2A)K(i): 149 & PLUSMN; 23 nM versus female rA(2A)K(i): 135 & PLUSMN; 29 nM. From the limited data at hand, we conclude that even when using female rats for in vitro studies without regard for the oestrous cycle, the obtained data did not vary much from their male counterparts.

Mechanisms of M3 Muscarinic Receptor Regulation by Wash-Resistant Xanomeline Binding	PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Muscarinic receptors; Xanomeline; Chinese hamster ovary cells; Radioligand binding; Inositol phosphates; Allosteric modulation	MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; NEURO-BLASTOMA CELLS; HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; DOWN-REGULATION; SUBTYPE SELECTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; KNOCKOUT MICE; RAT-BRAIN; AGONIST; DESENSITIZATION	Background/Aims: Xanomeline has been shown to bind in a unique manner at M1 and M3 muscarinic receptors, with interactions at both the orthosteric site and an allosteric site. We have previously shown that brief exposure of Chinese hamster ovary cells that express the M3 receptor to xanomeline followed by removal of free agonist results in a delayed decrease in radioligand binding and receptor response to agonists. In the current study, we were interested in determining the mechanisms of this effect. Methods: Cells were treated with carbachol, pilocarpine or xanomeline for 1 h followed by washing and either used immediately or after waiting for 23 h. Control groups included cells that were not exposed to agonists and cells that were treated with agonists for 24 h. Radioligand binding and functional assays were conducted to determine the effects of agonist treatments. Results: The above treatment protocol with xanomeline resulted in similar effects of the binding of [H-3] NMS and [H-3] QNB. When receptor function is blocked using a variety of methods, the long-term effects of xanomeline binding were absent. Conclusion: Our data indicate that xanomeline wash-resistant binding at the receptor allosteric site leads to receptor downregulation and that receptor activation is necessary for these effects.

In the present short communication we evaluated the age-related changes of the binding of this ligand to sigma(1) receptors in Fisher-344 rats (1.5-, 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old) by the in vitro binding assay. We also measured the binding of [H-3](+)-pentazocine to sigmal receptors and the binding of [H-3] 1,3-di-O-tolylguanidine to sigma(2) receptors, which are current standard methods. The specific binding of the three radioligands increased age-dependently. Both K-d and B-max values of the 24-month-old rats for each radioligand were significantly higher than those of the young rats (1.5- and 6-month-old). The increased numbers of both sigmal and sigma2 receptor subtypes in the aged rats compensate for the lowered affinity, and rather enhanced the radioligand-receptor binding. The results contrast strikingly with the age-dependent decrease in the dopaminergic, cholinergic and glutamatergic receptors that are reported to be correlated with the sigma receptors, and indicate that a PET study with [C-11]SA4503 to evaluate the aging process in humans would be of great interest.

Effect of a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, cyclosporin A, on the disposition in rodent brain and blood of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor radioligand, [<SUP>11</SUP>C](<i>R</i>)-(-)-RWAY	SYNAPSE			English	Article						cyclosporin A; CsA; P-glycoprotein; [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY; 5-HT1A receptors	DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; GENE POLYMORPHISM; BARRIER; SENSITIVITY; TOMOGRAPHY; SPECT; RAT	Limited brain uptake of radioligands with otherwise optimal properties for imaging brain receptors can be improved by blocking the effect of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux pump at the blood-brain barrier. Using small animal positron emission tomography (PET), we investigated how P-gp and its blockade with Cyclosporin A (CsA) affect rodent brain uptake of [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY, a radioligand for brain 5-HT1A receptors. Brain uptake of radioactivity was compared in control and CsA-treated rats as well as P-gp knockout and wild type mice. Parent radioligand and radiometabolite in plasma and brain samples were determined at 30 min after injection of radioligand. PET binding potential (BP) was calculated with a reference tissue model. P-gp knockout mice had 2.5- and 2.8-fold greater brain uptake of [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY than wild type ones, measured by in vivo PET and ex vivo tissue sampling, respectively. Similarly, CsA increased rat brain uptake 4.9- and 5.3-fold, in vivo and ex vivo. In addition, CsA increased the plasma free fraction of [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY in rats by 2.7-fold. Although CsA increased brain uptake in wild type mice by 2.5-fold, it had no effect on plasma free fraction in knockout animals. Three radiometabolites of [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY were uniformly distributed in rat brain, suggesting they were inactive. CsA treatment increased brain uptake of [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY and only one of its radiometabolites. Regional rat brain BP increased 27-70% in the CsA-treated rats and the P-gp knockout mice. [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY is a P-gp substrate in rat and mouse. The effects of CsA in rats are mediated by both P-gp blockade and displacement of the radiotracer from plasma proteins. Studies with wild type and knockout mice showed that CsA affected only P-gp in this species.

Ligand binding assays on monoaminergic GPCRs led to SARs that indicated further lead structure optimizations when the attachment of alkoxy substituents provided both an improvement of the biological properties and the opportunity to introduce F-18 as a radioisotope. Finally, radiosynthesis resulted in formation of the radioligand [F-18]7h that showed optimal logD(7.4) of 2.8 and was determined to be highly stable in human serum. Thus, [F-18]7h represents a promising dopamine D4 selective radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET). (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In vitro binding assays for the radioligands [In-111]In-DOTATATE; [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11; [Ga-67]Ga-Pentixafor; [In-111]In-DANBIRT; and [In-111]In-EC0800 were conducted, the expression of the radioligand targets was assessed via immunohistochemistry. Radioligand binding and expression of radioligand targets was investigated and compared. Results In sections characterized as vulnerable plaque, binding was highest for [In-111]In-EC0800; followed by [In-111]In-DANBIRT; [Ga-67]Ga-Pentixafor; [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11; and [In-111]In-DOTATATE (0.064 +/- 0.036; 0.052 +/- 0.029; 0.011 +/- 0.003; 0.0066 +/- 0.0021; 0.00064 +/- 0.00014 %Added activity/mm(2), respectively). Binding of [In-111]In-DANBIRT and [In-111]In-EC0800 was highest across plaque phenotypes, binding of [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11 and [Ga-67]Ga-Pentixafor differed most between plaque phenotypes. Binding of [In-111]In-DOTATATE was the lowest across plaque phenotypes. The areas positive for cells expressing the radioligand's target differed between plaque phenotypes for all targets, with lowest percentage area of expression in early plaque sections and highest in phenotypically vulnerable plaque sections. Conclusions Radioligands targeting inflammatory cell markers showed different levels of binding in atherosclerotic plaques and among plaque phenotypes. Different radioligands might be used for plaque detection and discerning early from vulnerable plaque. [In-111]In-EC0800 and [In-111]In-DANBIRT appear most suitable for plaque detection, while [Ga-67]Ga-Pentixafor and [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11 might be best suited for differentiation between plaque phenotypes.

Creation of protease-resistant somatostatin analogs has allowed development of these peptides as clinically useful drugs. Widespread diagnostic use of radiolabeled somatostatin analogs has enhanced interest in the binding and intracellular distribution of these peptides. The degree of drug internalization and length of drug retention may be critical for drug-induced cytotoxicity. We hypothesized that the ability of a radiolabeled peptide to bind to a cell, be internalized, and induce cytotoxicity is proportional to both the radioligand concentration and the exposure time. Materials and methods. To test this hypothesis, somatostatin receptor-expressing cells (IMR-32) were incubated with In-111-pentetreotide, a sst 2 preferring somatostatin analogue. Radioligand exposure time and/or concentration were varied. Results. Prolonged exposure to a fixed concentration of radioligand resulted in progressive increases in whole cell binding and internalization over time. Cells exposed to a relatively fixed number of muCi-Hr yielded constant whole cell binding and internalization. Increasing the muCi-Hr resulted in a proportionate increase in binding. Cytotoxicity was also proportional to the dose of radiation regardless of whether the exposure was internalized radiation (muCi-Hr from (111)Inpentetreotide) or from external beam radiation (cGy). Conclusion. Both drug exposure time and drug concentration contribute to cell binding and cytotoxicity in this model and their relative contributions are inversely related. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

WAY is now being applied widely for clinical research and drug development. However, WAY is rapidly cleared from plasma and is also rapidly metabolised. A comparable radioligand, with a higher and more sustained delivery to brain, is desirable since these properties might lead to better biomathematical modelling of acquired PET data. There are also needs for other types of 5-HT1A receptor radioligands, for example, ligands sensitive to elevated serotonin levels, ligands labelled with longer-lived fluorine-18 for distribution to "satellite" PET centres, and ligands labelled with iodine-123 for single photon emission computerised tomography (SPECT) imaging. Here we describe our progress toward these aims through the exploration of WAY analogues, including the development of [carbonyl-C-11]desmethyl-WAY (DWAY) as a promising, more brain-penetrant radioligand for PET imaging of human 5-HT1A receptors, and (pyridinyl-6-halo)-analogues as promising leads for the development of radiohalogenated ligands.

We previously developed a high-affinity PET ligand, C-11-NOP-1A, which yielded promising results in monkey brain. Here, we assessed the ability of C-11-NOP-1A to quantify NOP receptors in human brain and estimated its radiation safety profile. Methods: After intravenous injection of C-11-NOP-1A, 7 healthy subjects underwent brain PET for 2 h and serial sampling of radial arterial blood to measure parent radioligand concentrations. Distribution volume (V-T; a measure of receptor density) was determined by compartmental (1- and 2-tissue) and noncompartmental (Logan analysis and Ichise's bilinear analysis [MA1]) methods. A separate group of 9 healthy subjects underwent whole-body PET to estimate whole-body radiation exposure (effective dose). Results: After 11C-NOP-1A injection, the peak concentration of radioactivity in brain was high (similar to 5-7 standardized uptake values), occurred early (similar to 10 min), and then washed out quickly. The unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model gave excellent V-T identifiability (similar to 1.1% SE) and fitted the data better than a 1-tissue-compartment model. Regional V-T values (mL.cm(-3)) ranged from 10.1 in temporal cortex to 5.6 in cerebellum. VT was well identified in the initial 70 min of imaging and remained stable for the remaining 50 min, suggesting that brain radioactivity was most likely parent radioligand, as supported by the fact that all plasma radiometabolites of C-11-NOP-1A were less lipophilic than the parent radioligand. Voxel-based MA1 V-T values correlated well with results from the 2-tissue-compartment model, showing that parametric methods can be used to compare populations. Whole-body scans showed radioactivity in brain and in peripheral organs expressing NOP receptors, such as heart, pancreas, and spleen. C-11-NOP-1A was significantly metabolized and excreted via the hepatobiliary route. Gallbladder had the highest radiation exposure (21 mu Sv/MBq), and the effective dose was 4.3 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusion: C-11-NOP-1A is a promising radioligand that reliably quantifies NOP receptors in human brain. The effective dose in humans is low and similar to that of other C-11-labeled radioligands, allowing multiple scans in 1 subject.

Binding of this radioligand was observed with both types of membranes, but sites showing slow on-rate were found only an the transfected cells. These "slow" binding sites behaved as a kinetically homogeneous population and their interaction with the radioligand was shown to occur in two steps, R + Areversible arrow(KA)RAreversible arrow(k-i)(kt)(RA), including the relatively slow isomerization of the complex RA into (RA). Evidence was obtained to assign the isomerized ("slow") binding sites on the transfected cells as P2Y, receptor sites, differentiated from other binding sites of non-receptor origin by kinetic analysis, and characterised by the kinetic parameters K-A = 59 +/- 19 nM, k(i) = (9.0 +/- 0.8) 10(-3) s(-1) and k(-i) = (3.9 +/- 0.7) 10(-3) s(-1). [S-35]dATPalphaS binding, with kinetic criteria, can be of value for differentiation of the receptor sites from non-receptor sites and thus provides solid basis for radioligand assay of P2Y(1) receptors.

Radiolabeling of HpDs is helpful for preclinical and clinical studies of PDT. Methods: The histidine-coupled hematoporphyrin (His-Hp) was synthesized and radiolabeled with [Tc-99m(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+). Biodistribution of the radioligand and fluorescent imaging of His-Hp in mice bearing S180 tumor were investigated. Results: [Tc-99m(CO)(3)](+)-labeled His-Hp was electrically neutral, hydrophilic and stable. The biodistribution of the radioligand in S180 tumor-bearing mice was similar with that of nonlabeled HpD in the literature. The uptake of His-Hp in tumors and livers was confirmed by fluorescent imaging. Conclusions: The complex [Tc-99m(CO)(3)](+)-His-Hp might be suitable for in vivo dose evaluation of HpD in PDT.

The aim of this study was to measure overall-survival (OS) in mCRPC patients who received either abiraterone or enzalutamide prior to PSMA therapy. The second aim of this study was to analyse the predictors of OS according to different pre-therapeutic parameters and also the responses to the first cycle of radioligand therapy (RLT) base on PSA level. Patients with mCRPC and a history of therapy with either abiraterone or enzalutamide or both, were included in this study. Different laboratory tests and pre-therapeutic parameters have been included into the analysis. One-hundred patients received a total of 347 cycles of Lu-PSMA (median: three cycles). 69 patients showed a decline in PSA two months after the first cycle, and 38 of those patients showed a PSA decline of = > 50%. The median OS was 60 weeks. In the multivariate analysis, the level of albumin, AST and haemoglobin, existence of liver metastases and a decline of > 14% in PSA level had a significant impact on overall-survival. The median OS is significantly longer in patients without hepatic involvement, with high levels of albumin and Hb and low levels of AST. A decline in PSA levels of more than 14% was the most important response parameter with regard to overall survival.

[(3)H][(1S,2R)ACHC](2)EM-2 (specific activity 63.49 Ci x mmol(-1)) bound specifically to its binding sites with high affinity (K(D) = 0.55 +/- 0.06 nM) and saturably, yielding a receptor density, B(max) of 151 +/- 4 fmol x mg protein(-1) in rat brain membranes. A similar affinity value was obtained in kinetic assays. Both Na(+) and Gpp(NH)p decreased the affinity, proving the agonist character of the radioligand. Specific mu-opioid ligands displaced the radioligand with much higher affinities than did delta- and kappa-ligands. The autoradiographic distribution of the binding sites of [(3)H][(1S,2R)ACHC](2)EM-2 agreed well with the known locations of the mu-opioid receptors in the rat brain. In consequence of its high affinity, selectivity and enzymatic resistance [19], the new radioligand will be a good tool in studies of the topographical requirements of mu-opioid-specific peptide binding.

In healthy volunteers, the receptor activity decreased after 30 min upon the inhalation of salbutamol and restored to the initial level after 2 h. At the same time, there were changes in the transcription level of the ADRB2 gene, which encodes the protein component of the beta(2)-adrenoreceptor. The dynamics of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor activity of T-lymphocytes after salbutamol treatment in patients with cardiorespiratory pathology significantly differed from that in healthy volunteers.

Translocation of amino acids and derivatives thereof across biological membranes is mediated by amino acid transporters. 4F2hc-LAT1 is a heterodimeric amino acid transporter that is composed of two subunits belonging to the SLC3 (4F2hc) and SLC7 (LAT1) solute carrier families. The ancillary protein 4F2hc is responsible for the correct trafficking and regulation of the transporter LAT1. Preclinical studies have identified 4F2hc-LAT1 as a valid anticancer target due to its importance in tumor progression. The scintillation proximity assay (SPA) is a valuable radioligand binding assay that allows the identification and characterization of ligands of membrane proteins. Here, we present a SPA ligand binding study using purified recombinant human 4F2hc-LAT1 protein and the radioligand [H-3]L-leucine as tracer. Binding affinities of different 4F2hc-LAT1 substrates and inhibitors determined by SPA are comparable with previously reported K (m) and IC (50) values from 4F2hc-LAT1 cell-based uptake assays. In summary, the SPA is a valuable method for the identification and characterization of ligands of membrane transporters including inhibitors. In contrast to cell-based assays, where the potential interference with other proteins such as endogenous transporters persists, the SPA uses purified protein making target engagement and characterization of ligands highly reliable.

Allosteric modulation of sigma receptors by BH3 mimetics ABT-737, ABT-263 (Navitoclax) and ABT-199 (Venetoclax)	PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Sigma receptor; BH3 mimetic; Allosteric modulator; ABT-737; ABT-263; ABT-199	CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC-LEUKEMIA; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; BINDING-AFFINITY; LIGAND-BINDING; RECOGNITION SITES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; TARGETING BCL2; LIPID RAFTS; RAT-LIVER; IN-VITRO	ABT-737, ABT-263 (Navitoclax) and ABT-199 (Venetoclax) are under intensive preclinical and clinical investigation as treatments for hematologic and other malignancies. These small molecules mimic pro-death B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) Homology 3 (BH3) domain-only proteins. They also bear a structural resemblance to certain sigma (sigma) receptor ligands. Moreover, the Bcl-2 and a receptor protein families are both located primarily at the endoplasmic reticulum, mediate cell death and survival through protein-protein interactions, and physically associate. Accordingly, we examined the ability of the ABT series of BH3 mimetics to interact with sigma receptors using radioligand-binding techniques. Negative allosteric modulation of [H-3](+)-pentazocine, an agonist, binding to al receptors in guinea pig brain membranes was observed for ABT-737, ABT-263 and ABT-199. Findings included reduction of specific binding to distinct plateaus in concentration-dependent fashion, significant slowing of radioligand dissociation kinetics, and decreases in radioligand affinity with no or modest changes in maximal receptor densities. Using a ternary complex model, dissociation constants (K-X) for modulator binding to the sigma 1 receptor ranted from 1 to 2.5 mu M, while negative cooperativity factors (alpha), representing the changes in affinity of ligand and modulator when bound as a ternary complex with the receptor, ranged from 0.15 to 0.42. These observations were extended and reinforced by studies using intact small cell (NCI-H69) and non-small cell (NCI-H23) lung cancer cells, and by using an antagonist sigma 1 receptor radioligand, E-N-1-(3'-[I-125] iodoallyl)-N'-4-(3 '',4 ''-dimethoxyphenethyl)piperazine, in mouse brain membranes. By contrast, exploratory studies indicate marked enhancement of the a2 receptor binding of [H-3]1,3-di-(o-tolyl)guanidine/(+)-pentazocine in NCI-H23 cells and guinea pig brain membranes. These findings raise intriguing questions regarding mechanism and potential functional outcomes.

The aim of this study was to determine the test-retest reliability of [C-11]P943 using two different modeling methods and to perform a power analysis with each quantification technique. Seven healthy volunteers underwent two PET scans on the same day. Regions of interest (ROIs) were the amygdala, hippocampus, pallidum, putamen, insula, frontal, anterior cingulate, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices, and cerebellum. Two multilinear radioligand quantification techniques were used to estimate binding potential: MA1, using arterial input function data, and the second version of the multilinear reference tissue model analysis (MRTM2), using the cerebellum as the reference region. Between-scan percent variability and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were used to assess test-retest reliability. We also performed power analyses to determine the method that would allow the least number of subjects using within-subject or between-subject study designs. A voxel-wise ICC analysis for MRTM2 BPND was performed for the whole brain and all the ROIs studied. Mean percent variability between two scans across regions ranged between 0.4 % and 12.4 % for MA1 BPND, 0.5 % and 11.5 % for MA1 BPP, 16.7 % and 28.3 % for MA1 BPF, and between 0.2 % and 5.4 % for MRTM2 BPND. The power analyses showed a greater number of subjects were required using MA1 BPF compared with other outcome measures for both within-subject and between-subject study designs. ICC values were the highest using MRTM2 BPND and the lowest with MA1 BPF in ten ROIs. Small regions and regions with low binding had lower ICC values than large regions and regions with high binding. Reliable measures of 5-HT1B receptor binding can be obtained using the novel PET radioligand [C-11]P943. Quantification of 5-HT1B receptor binding with MRTM2 BPND and with MA1 BPP provided the least variability and optimal power for within-subject and between-subject designs.

Development of a competitive fluorescence-based synaptosome binding assay for brevetoxins	HARMFUL ALGAE			English	Article						BODIPY; Brevetoxin; Competition binding assay; Fluorescence assay	DINOFLAGELLATE KARENIA-BREVIS; SENSITIVE SODIUM-CHANNELS; FLORIDA RED TIDE; AEROSOLIZED BREVETOXINS; RAT-BRAIN; LIGANDS; ACTIVATORS; RECEPTORS; SHELLFISH; NEURONS	Brevetoxins are a family of ladder-frame polyether toxins produced during blooms of the marine dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. Inhalation of brevetoxins aerosolized by wind and wave action can lead to asthma-like symptoms in beach goers. Consumption of either shellfish or finfish exposed to K. brevis blooms can lead to the development of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. The toxic effects of brevetoxins are due to activation of voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs) in cell membranes. Binding of brevetoxin analogs and competitors to site 5 on these channels has historically been measured using a radioligand competition assay that is fraught with difficulty, including slow analysis time, production of radioactive waste, and cumbersome and expensive methods associated with the generation of radioactive labeled ligands. In this study, we describe the development of a novel fluorescent synaptosome binding assay for the brevetoxin receptor. BODIPY (R)-conjugated to PbTx-2 was used as the labeled ligand. The BODIPY (R)-PbTx-2 conjugate was found to displace [H-3]-PbTx-3 from its binding site on VSSCs on rat brain synaptosomes with an equilibrium inhibition constant of 0.11 nM. We have shown that brevetoxin A and B analogs are all able to compete for binding with the fluorescent ligand. Most importantly, this assay was validated against the current site 5 receptor binding assay standard, the radioligand receptor assay for the brevetoxin receptor using [H-3]-PbTx-3 as the labeled ligand. The fluorescence based assay yielded equilibrium inhibition constants comparable to the radioligand assay for all brevetoxin analogs. The fluorescence based assay was quicker, far less expensive, and did not generate radioactive waste or need radioactive facilities. As such, this fluorescence-based assay can be used to replace the current radioligand assay for site 5 on voltagesensitive sodium channels and will be a vital tool for future experiments examining the binding affinity of various ligands for site 5 on sodium channels.

J	Moller, M; Rodell, A; Gjedde, A				Moller, Mette; Rodell, Anders; Gjedde, Albert			Parametric Mapping of 5HT<sub>1A</sub> Receptor Sites in the Human Brain with the Hypotime Method: Theory and Normal Values	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neurotransmission; serotonin 5HT(1A) receptors; PET; C-11-WAY-100635; Hypotime	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; C-11 WAY-100635; BINDING; SEROTONIN; PET; AGE; RADIOLIGAND; CEREBELLUM; LIGAND	The radioligand [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 (C-11-WAY) is a PET tracer of the serotonin 5HT(1A) receptors in the human brain. It is metabolized so rapidly in the circulation that it behaves more as a chemical microsphere than as a tracer subject to continuous exchange between the circulation and brain tissue. Although reference tissue methods are useful as analyses of uptake of some radioligands with indeterminate arterial input functions, their use to analyze C-11-WAY uptake and binding is challenged by the rapid plasma metabolism, which violates the assumption that regions of interest and reference regions continue to exchange radioligand with the circulation during the entire uptake period. Here, we proposed a method of calculation (Hypotime) that specifically uses the washout rather than the accumulation of C-11-WAY to determine binding potentials (BPND), without the use of regression analysis. Methods: A total of 19 healthy volunteers (age range, 23-73 y) underwent PET to test the Hypotime application of the chemical microsphere properties of C-11-WAY to identify regions of binding and nonbinding on the exclusive basis of the rate of washout of C-11-WAY. Results: The results of the Hypotime method were compared with the simplified but multi-linearized reference tissue method (MLSRTM). The distribution of receptor BPND obtained with Hypotime was consistent with previous autoradiography of postmortem brain tissue, with the highest values of BPND recorded in the medial temporal lobe and decline of receptor availability with age. The values in the basal ganglia and cerebellum were negligible. The MLSRTM, in contrast, yielded lower BPND in all regions and only weakly revealed the decline with age. Conclusion: The simple and computationally efficient Hypotime method gave reliable values of BPND without the use of regression. The MLSRTM, on the other hand, appeared to be affected by the early disappearance of the radioligand from the circulation and the associated uncertain late presence of C-11-WAY in the circulation.

Nucleophilic radiofluorination of the precursor tosylate 8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-tosyloxypropyl)-7-pivaloyloxymethyl-1-propylxanthine, 2, with nca [F-18]KF under aminopolyether-mediated conditions (Kryptofix 2.2.2/K2CO3) followed by deprotection was straightforward and, after formulation, gave the radioligand ready for injection with a radiochemical yield of 45 +/- 7%, a radiochemical purity of >98% and a specific radioactivity of >270 GBq/mumol (>7.2 Ci/mumol). Preparation time averaged 55 min. The synthesis proved reliable for high batch. yields (similar to7.5 GBq) in routine production (n = 120 runs). The radiotracer was pharmacologically evaluated in vitro and in vivo and its pharmacokinetics in rodents determined in detail. After iv injection a high accumulation of radioactivity occurred in several regions of mouse brain including thalamus, striatum, cortex, and cerebellum. Antagonism by the specific A(1)AR antagonists 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) and N-6-cyclopentyl-9-methyladenine (N-0840), but not with the A(2)AR antagonist 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine (DMPX), indicated specific and reversible binding of the radioligand to A(1)AR in cortical and subcortical regions of interest. In mouse blood at least two polar metabolites formed rapidly (50% at 5 min after tracer application). However, chromatographic analyses of brain homogenate extracts taken 60 min pi showed that >98% of radioactivity was unchanged radioligand. Chromatographic isolation and reinjection of peripherally formed radioactive metabolites revealed no accumulation of radioactivity in mouse brain, probably due to the polarity of the metabolites. These preliminary results suggest that nca [18F]CPFPX is a useful radioligand for the noninvasive imaging of the brain A(1)AR.

We retrospectively analyzed efficacy-related outcomes of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT in this setting and potential predictors of those outcomes. Methods Twenty-eight consecutive mCRPC patients with liver metastases given Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT were analyzed retrospectively. Their planned regimen was 4-6 cycles at 6 +/- 2-week intervals; the mean activity/cycle was 6.5 +/- 0.5 GBq. Hepatic response was determined by modified positron emission tomography response criteria in solid tumors; association of such response with overall survival (OS) was tested, as were relationships of the selected patient, disease, and treatment characteristics with hepatic progression-free survival (PFShep) and OS. Survival analyses used Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test at p < 0.05 significance, and Cox proportional-hazards modeling. Results Median (minimum-maximum) follow-up was 37.5 (2.3-50.6) months. In liver metastases, complete or partial response was observed in 6 patients (21%) each, and stable disease in 1 (4%), for hepatic disease control in 46%. Overall, median (95% confidence interval) PFShep was 5.7 (2.2-9.2) months, and OS, 11.7 (3.0-20.4) months. Patients with hepatic disease control did not reach the median OS, while those with hepatic progressive disease had median OS (95% confidence interval) of 6.4 (1.6-11.1) months. In multivariate analysis, hepatic disease control by Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT was significantly independently associated with OS, as was a prostate-specific antigen decline of >= 50% after 2 RLT cycles, and good baseline performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 0-1). Hepatic tumor burden (<= 25% vs. > 25% of liver volume) had no apparent relationship with hepatic tumor response, PFShep, or OS. Conclusion Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT frequently controlled liver metastases, resulting in long PFShep and significantly improved OS. Hepatic tumor burden appeared to lack any relationship with treatment efficacy, supporting Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT of late-stage/end-stage mCRPC with liver metastases.

Here, we show how to include the duration of radioligand injection in the PPf model formulations to achieve a more physiologic description of the plasma measurements. This formulation (here called convoluted model) was tested on simulated data and on three datasets with different parent kinetics: [C-11]NOP-1A, [C-11]MePPEP, and [C-11](R)-rolipram. Results showed that convoluted PPf models better described the fraction of unchanged parent in the plasma compared with standard models for all three datasets (weighted residuals sum of squares up to 25% lower). When considering the effect on tissue quantification, the overall impact on the total volume of distribution (V-T) was low. However, the impact was significant and radioligand-dependent on the binding potential (BP) and the microparameters (K-1, k(2), k(3), and k(4)). Simulated data confirmed that quantification is sensitive to different degrees to PPf model misspecification. Including the injection duration allows obtaining a more accurate correction of the input function for the presence of radiometabolites and this yields a more reliable quantification of the tissue parameters.

In this study, we present the somatostatin mimic [DOTA]LTT-SS28 {[(DOTA)-Ser(1),Leu(8),D-Trp(22),Tyr(25)]SS28} and its In-111 radioligand. [DOTA]LTT-SS28 exhibited a pansomatostatin-like profile binding with high affinity to all five hsst(1)-hsst(5) subtypes (IC50 values in the lower nanomolar range). Furthermore, [DOTA]LTT-SS28 behaved as an agonist at hsst(upsilon), hsst(3), and hsst(5), efficiently stimulating internalization of the three receptor subtypes. Radioligand [In-111-DOTA]LTT-SS28 showed good stability in the mouse bloodstream. It displayed strong and specific uptake in AR42J tumors 4 h postinjection (9.3 +/- 1.6% ID/g vs 0.3 +/- 0.0% 1D/g during sst(2) blockade) in mice. Significant and specific uptake was also observed in HEK293-hsst(2)-, HEK293-hsst(3)-, and HEK293-hsst(5)-expressing tumors (4.43 +/- 1.5, 4.88 +/- 1.1, and <3% ID/g, respectively, with values of <0.596 1D/g during receptor blockade). In conclusion, the somatostatin mimic [In-111-DOTA]LTT-SS28 specifically localizes in sst(2)-, sst(3)-, and sst(5)-expressing xenografts in mice showing promise for multi-sst(1)-sst(5) targeted tumor imaging.

However, it has been suggested that rather than the fibrillary A beta deposits, it is smaller, soluble A beta ag-gregates that exert a neurotoxic effect and trigger AD pathogenesis. The aim of the current study is to develop a PET probe that is capable of detecting small aggregates and soluble A beta oligomers for improved diagnosis and therapy monitoring. An 18F-labeled radioligand was prepared based on the A beta-binding D-enantiomeric peptide RD2, which is currently being evaluated in clinical trials as a therapeutic agent to dissolve A beta oligomers. 18F -labeling was carried out using palladium-catalyzed S-arylation of RD2 with 2-[18F]fluoro-5-iodopyridine ([18F] FIPy). Specific binding of [18F]RD2-cFPy to brain material from transgenic AD (APP/PS1) mice and AD patients was demonstrated with in vitro autoradiography. In vivo uptake and biodistribution of [18F]RD2-cFPy were evaluated using PET analyses in wild-type and transgenic APP/PS1 mice. Although brain penetration and brain wash-out kinetics of the radioligand were low, this study provides proof of principle for a PET probe based on a D- enantiomeric peptide binding to soluble A beta species.

Methods: Six patients with heavily pretreated relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (3 men, 3 women; aged, 54 +/- 8 y) underwent CXCR4-directed RLT in combination with conditioning chemotherapy and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. In 2 patients, radioimmunotherapy targeting CD20 or CD66 was added to enhance antilymphoma activity. Endpoints were incidence and severity of adverse events, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: RLT and additional radioimmunotherapy were well tolerated, without any acute adverse events or changes in vital signs. Successful engraftment was recorded after a median of 11 d (range, 9-13 d). Of the 4 patients who were available for follow-up (one patient died of CNS aspergillosis 29 d after RLT and another of sepsis in aplasia 34 d after RLT), CXCR4-directed RLT resulted in a partial response in two (both treated with additional radioimmunotherapy) and a mixed response in the remaining two. The response duration was rather short-lived, with a median progression-free survival of 62 d (range, 29-110 d) and a median overall survival of 76 d (range, 29-334 d). Conclusion: CXCR4-directed RLT (in combination with additional radioimmunotherapy) is feasible as a conditioning regimen before allogeneic stem cell transplantation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

KaSP Consortium	Lower levels of the glial cell marker TSPO in drug-naive first-episode psychosis patients as measured using PET and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							CONSENSUS COGNITIVE BATTERY; RECENT-ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; KDA TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; IN-VIVO; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; HUMAN-BRAIN; NEUROINFLAMMATION; QUANTIFICATION; ACTIVATION	Several lines of evidence are indicative of a role for immune activation in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Nevertheless, studies using positron emission tomography (PET) and radioligands for the translocator protein (TSPO), a marker for glial activation, have yielded inconsistent results. Whereas early studies using a radioligand with low signal-to-noise in small samples showed increases in patients, more recent studies with improved methodology have shown no differences or trend-level decreases. Importantly, all patients investigated thus far have been on antipsychotic medication, and as these compounds may dampen immune cell activity, this factor limits the conclusions that can be drawn. Here, we examined 16 drug-naive, first-episode psychosis patients and 16 healthy controls using PET and the TSPO radioligand [C-11]PBR28. Gray matter (GM) volume of distribution (V-T) derived from a two-tissue compartmental analysis with arterial input function was the main outcome measure. Statistical analyses were performed controlling for both TSPO genotype, which is known to affect [C-11]PBR28 binding, and gender. There was a significant reduction of [C-11]PBR28 V-T in patients compared with healthy controls in GM as well as in secondary regions of interest. No correlation was observed between GM V-T and clinical or cognitive measures after correction for multiple comparisons. The observed decrease in TSPO binding suggests reduced numbers or altered function of immune cells in brain in early-stage schizophrenia.

J	Hu, LA; Zhou, T; Hamman, BD; Liu, QY				Hu, Liaoyuan A.; Zhou, Tian; Hamman, Brian D.; Liu, Qingyun			A homogeneous G protein-coupled receptor ligand binding assay based on time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer	ASSAY AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							RADIOLIGAND BINDING; POLARIZATION; C5A	Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has emerged as a powerful tool to the study of protein-protein interactions, such as receptor-ligand binding. However, the application of FRET to the study of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been limited by the method of labeling receptor with fluorescence probes. Here we described a novel time-resolved (TR)-FRET method to study GPCR-ligand binding by using human complement 5a (C5a) receptor (C5aR) as a model system. Human C5aR was expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope at the N-terminus. Purified human C5a was labeled with terbium chelate and used as the fluorescence donor. Monoclonal anti-HA antibody conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 was used as the fluorescence acceptor. Robust FRET signal was observed when the labeled ligand and C5aR membrane were mixed in the presence of the conjugated anti-HA antibody. This FRET signal was specific and saturable. C5a binding affinity to C5aR measured by the FRET assay was consistent with the data as determined by competition binding analysis using radiolabeled C5a. The FRET assay was also used to determine affinity of C5aR antagonists by competition binding analysis, and the data are similar to those from radioligand binding studies. Compared to the commonly used radioligand binding assay, this TR-FRET-based assay provides a nonradioactive, faster, and sensitive homogeneous assay format that could be easily adapted to high-throughput screening. The principle of this assay should also be applicable to other GPCRs, especially to those receptors with peptide or protein ligands.

Various pre-targeting systems have been reported to address limitations associated with traditional immuno-PET. However, the application of these mono-receptor based pre-targeting (MRPT) strategies is limited to non-internalizable antibodies, and the tumor uptake is usually much lower than that in the corresponding immuno-PET. To circumvent these limitations, the first dual-receptor enhanced pre-targeting (DRPT) system is developed through entrapping the tumor-receptor-specific radioligand by the pre-administered antibody. Besides the similar ligation pathway happens in MRPT, incorporation of a tumor-receptor-specific peptide into the radioligand in DRPT enhances both concentration and retention of the radioligand on tumor, promoting its ligation with pre-administered antibody on cell-surface and/or internalized into tumor-cells. In this study, Cu-64-based DRPT shows superior performance over corresponding MRPT and immuno-PET using internalizable antibodies. Besides, the compatibility of DRPT with short-lived and generator-produced Ga-68 is demonstrated, leveraging its advantage in reducing radio-dose exposure. Furthermore, the feasibility of reducing the amount of the pre-administered antibody is confirmed, indicating the cost saving potential of DRPT. In summary, synergizing advantages of dual-receptor targeting and pre-targeting, it is expect that this DRPT strategy can become a breakthrough technology in the field of antibody-based molecular imaging.

Imaging Striatal Microglial Activation in Patients with Parkinson's Disease	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; HUMAN BRAIN; BINDING-AFFINITY; PET RADIOLIGAND; FACTOR-ALPHA; POLYMORPHISM; ALZHEIMERS; INTERLEUKIN-1-BETA; NEUROINFLAMMATION	This study investigated whether the second-generation translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) radioligand, [F-18]-FEPPA, could be used in neurodegenerative parkinsonian disorders as a biomarker for detecting neuroinflammation in the striatum. Neuroinflammation has been implicated as a potential mechanism for the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radioligand targeting for TSPO allows for the quantification of neuroinflammation in vivo. Based on genotype of the rs6791 polymorphism in the TSPO gene, 16 mixed-affinity binders (MABs) (8 PD and age-matched 8 healthy controls (HCs)), 16 high-affinity binders (HABs) (8 PD and age-matched 8 HCs) and 4 low-affinity binders (LABs) (3 PD and 1 HCs) were identified. Total distribution volume (V-T) values in the striatum were derived from a two-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma as an input function. There was a significant main effect of genotype on [F-18]-FEPPA VT values in the caudate nucleus (p = 0.001) and putamen (p < 0.001), but no main effect of disease or disease x genotype interaction in either ROI. In the HAB group, the percentage difference between PD and HC was 16% in both caudate nucleus and putamen; in the MAB group, it was -8% and 3%, respectively. While this PET study showed no evidence of increased striatal TSPO expression in PD patients, the current findings provide some insights on the possible interactions between rs6791 polymorphism and neuroinflammation in PD.

Orthosteric and/or Allosteric Binding of -Conotoxins to Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors and Their Models	MARINE DRUGS			English	Article						conotoxins; nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; ligand-binding domain; acetylcholine-binding protein; binding site; radioligand analysis	ALPHA-O-CONOTOXIN; DIFFERENTIAL SENSITIVITY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ACHBP; SELECTIVITY; DETERMINANTS; NEUROTOXINS; SUBUNIT; ANALOGS; COMPLEX	-Conotoxins from Conus snails are capable of distinguishing muscle and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). -Conotoxin RgIA and O-conotoxin GeXIVA, blocking neuronal 910 nAChR, are potential analgesics. Typically, -conotoxins bind to the orthosteric sites for agonists/competitive antagonists, but O-conotoxin GeXIVA was proposed to attach allosterically, judging by electrophysiological experiments on 910 nAChR. We decided to verify this conclusion by radioligand analysis in competition with -bungarotoxin (Bgt) on the ligand-binding domain of the nAChR 9 subunit (9 LBD), where, from the X-ray analysis, Bgt binds at the orthosteric site. A competition with Bgt was registered for GeXIVA and RgIA, IC50 values being in the micromolar range. However, high nonspecific binding of conotoxins (detected with their radioiodinated derivatives) to His(6)-resin attaching 9 LBD did not allow us to accurately measure IC(50)s. However, IC(50)s were measured for binding to Aplysia californica AChBP: the RgIA globular isomer, known to be active against 910 nAChR, was more efficient than the ribbon one, whereas all three GeXIVA isomers had similar potencies at low mu M. Thus, radioligand analysis indicated that both conotoxins can attach to the orthosteric sites in these nAChR models, which should be taken into account in the design of analgesics on the basis of these conotoxins.

The fact that the present radioligand Tc-99m-kanamycin used for diagnosis is short-lived, raised a need to label and study kanamycin with one of the most important beta () radiation emitting isotope Lu-177. Labeling yield of Lu-177-kanamycin was confirmed by different chromatography techniques such as paper chromatography, TLC, HPLC. Several experiments were performed to optimize labeling with changing reaction conditions such as pH, temperature, amount of ligand, and reaction time. In vitro stability analysis was performed incubation with human serum. Electrophoresis analysis was also conducted to determine the charge on Lu-177-kanamycin. The biodistribution and scintigraphy were performed in normal mice and rabbit, respectively, at different time intervals of postinjection. Lu-177-kanamycin was prepared with very high yield (similar to 100%), with excellent stability in vivo and in vitro (>99% 6hr postprep.), at pH 7. Maximum labeling was achieved at less reaction time (15min), with maximum conjugation of the ligand (12.5mg) with Lu-177. Electrophoresis analysis showed net neutral charge. The radioligand showed rapid clearance from body in biodistribution and scintigraphy studies. The preparation Lu-177-kanamycin could be used as a radio-pharmaceutical for infection imaging purpose, especially when transporting the radioligand to long-range distances.

In order to better comprehend the mechanism involved in this phenomenon, we tested the PKA and PKC activation effect on the specific [(3)H] glycine and [(3)H] strychnine binding to postsynaptic glycine receptor (GlyR) in intact rat retina. The specific binding constituted about 20% of the total radioligand binding. Kinetic analysis of the specific binding exhibited a sigmoidal behavior with three glycine and two strychnine binding sites and affinities of 212 nM for [(3)H] glycine and 50 nM for [(3)H] strychnine. Specific radioligand binding was decreased (60-85%) by PKA and PKC activation, an effect that was blocked by specific kinases inhibitors, as well as by cytochalasin D. GlyR expressed in the plasma membrane decreased about 50% in response to kinases activation, which was consistent with an increase of the receptor in the microsomal fraction when PKA was activated. Moreover, immunoprecipitation studies indicated that these kinases lead to a time-dependent receptor phosphorylation. Our results suggest that in retina, GlyR is cross-regulated by G protein-coupled receptors, activating PKA and PKC. Synapse 65:1231-1238, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

This study describes the synthesis and in vitro characterization of the radiolabeled derivative of OSIP339391, a novel, potent, and selective pyrrolopyrimidine A(2B) antagonist. OSIP339391 had a selectivity of greater than 70-fold for A(2B) receptors over other human adenosine receptor subtypes. The radiolabel was introduced by hydrogenation of the acetylenic precursor with tritium gas resulting in the incorporation (on average) of three tritium atoms in the molecule, yielding a ligand with specific activity of 87 Ci/mmol (3.2 TBq/mmol). Using membranes from HEK-293 cells expressing the human recombinant A2B receptor, [H-3]OSIP339391 was characterized in kinetic, saturation, and competition binding experiments. From the association and dissociation rate studies, the affinity was 0.41 nM and in close agreement with that found in saturation binding experiments (0.17 nM). In competition, binding studies using 0.5 nM [H-3]OSIP339391, the affinity of a range of agonists and antagonists was consistent with previously reported data. Thus, [H-3]OSIP339391 is a novel, selective, and high affinity radioligand that can be a useful tool in the further exploration and characterization of recombinant and endogenous adenosine A(2B) receptors.

For that reason, and in order to obtain a selective radiotracer applicable to PET, we report here the carbon-11 labelling of a selective 5-HTT radioligand: N, N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-methylphenylthio)benzylamine or MADAM in two different positions: [p-C-11-methyl]MADAM and [N-C-11-methyl]MADAM. The synthesis of Bu3Sn-ADAM and N-dimethyl-MADAM is described. [p-C-11-methyl]MADAM was obtained by a Stille coupling reaction between Bu3Sn-ADAM and [C-11]methyl iodide using palladium (0) as a catalyst without (Ia) or with cop-per chloride as a co-catalyst (Ib). [N-C-11-methyl]MADAM was obtained by an N-methylation reaction between N-demethyl-MADAM and [C-11]methyl iodide (II). The carbon-11 incorporation yield in [p-C-11-methyl]MADAM was 10-30% (Ia and Ib) and in [N-C-11-methyl]MADAM was 75-80% (II).

EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Whole-cell patch-clamp technique and radioligand-binding methods were used to analyse the effects of anandamide in rat ventricular myocytes. KEY RESULTS In the presence of 1-10 M AEA, suppression of both Na+ and L-type Ca2+ channels was observed. Inhibition of Na+ channels was voltage and Pertussis toxin (PTX) - independent. Radioligand-binding studies indicated that specific binding of [H-3] batrachotoxin (BTX) to ventricular muscle membranes was also inhibited significantly by 10 mu M metAEA, a non-metabolized AEA analogue, with a marked decrease in B-max values but no change in K-d. Further studies on L-type Ca2+ channels indicated that AEA potently inhibited these channels (IC50 0.1 mu M) in a voltage-and PTX-independent manner. AEA inhibited maximal amplitudes without affecting the kinetics of Ba2+ currents. MetAEA also inhibited Na+ and L-type Ca2+ currents. Radioligand studies indicated that specific binding of [H-3]isradipine, was inhibited significantly by metAEA. (10 mu M), changing B-max but not K-d. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Results indicate that AEA inhibited the function of voltage-dependent Na+ and L-type Ca2+ channels in rat ventricular myocytes, independent of CB1 and CB2 receptor activation.

This agonist ligand series, based on nucleoside analogues containing a rigid, bicyclic ring system in place of the ribose moiety, was selected for radiolabeling due to its high A(3)AR affinity across species, with nanomolar binding at both rat and human A(3)ARs. The radioiodination of MRS1898 on its N (6)-3-iodobenzyl substituent was accomplished in 76% radiochemical yield by iododestannylation of a 3-(trimethylstannyl)benzyl precursor. [I-125]MRS1898 bound to the rat A(3)AR with a K-d value of 0.17 +/- 0.04 nM and a B-max value of 0.66 +/- 0.15 pmol/mg protein. The competition binding profiles for other agonists and antagonists obtained with this radioligand are similar to those previously obtained with other radioligands. The advantages of [I-125]MRS1898 compared with previously used radioligands are primarily its high selectivity and affinity for the rat A(3)AR and also its facile synthesis and radiochemical stability; however, a relatively high level of nonspecific binding presents a limitation. Thus, we have introduced the first selective radioligand for the rat A(3)AR.

Several compounds of this series were radiolabeled with C-11 and evaluated in vivo in mice and monkeys as potential candidates for PET imaging of nAChRs. [C-11]Me-p-PVC (K-i =56 pm at 37degreesC; logD = 1.6) was identified as a radioligand suitable for the in vivo imaging of the alpha4beta2* nAChR subtype. Compared with 2-[F-18]FA, a PET radioligand that has been successfully used in humans and is characterized by a slow kinetic of brain distribution, [C-11]Me-p-PVC is more lipophilic. As a result, [C-11]Me-p-PVC accumulated in the brain more rapidly than 2-[F-18]FA. Pharmacological evaluation of Me-p-PVC in mice demonstrated that the toxicity of this compound was comparable with or lower than that of 2-FA. Taken together, these results suggest that [C-11]Me-p-PVC is a promising PET radioligand for studying nAChR occupancy by endogenous and exogenous ligands in the brain in vivo.

The presence of a quinoxaline has a favourable impact in terms of serotonin 5-HT1A versus dopamine D4.2 receptor selectivity. Compounds with a 3-CF3 group at the distal phenyl ring are the most effective in terms of affinity and selectivity for 5-HT1A versus D4.2 receptors. A 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine in place of the corresponding 4-phenyl-piperazine side chain is also favourable not only for the affinity for 5-HT1A and D4.2 receptors but also in some cases for alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors.

Radioligand therapy (RLT) targeting PSMA has shown impressive results in recent years in treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In some patients, however, the disease worsens during PSMA-RLT. A proportion of these patients develop a type of metastasis that has intense glucose metabolism but missing or low PSMA expression; these metastases are referred to as 'mismatch metastases'. We found that combined PET imaging using the radiolabeled glucose analog [F-18]FDG and the PSMA radioligand [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 is essential to identify patients with mismatch findings, which are associated with significantly worse outcome, especially if the mismatch is located in the liver or of high volume. Consequently, additional treatments or change to another treatment modality appears necessary. Despite the promising results of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), some patients show worsening disease during PSMA-RLT. We investigated the value of combined [F-18]FDG and [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging in this setting. In n = 29 mCRPC patients with worsening disease after a median of four cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT, combined [F-18]FDG and [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging was performed to detect [F-18]FDG-avid lesions with low or no PSMA expression (mismatch lesions). To evaluate prognostic implication of mismatch, survival analyses regarding presence, location, and [F-18]FDG PET-derived parameters such as SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume (MTVm), and total lesion glycolysis (TLG(m)) of mismatch findings were performed. Seventeen patients (59%) showed at least one mismatch metastasis. From the time point of combined PET imaging, the median overall survival (OS) of patients with mismatch findings was significantly (p = 0.008) shorter than those without (3.3 vs. 6.1 mo). Patients with a high MTVm revealed a significantly (p = 0.034) shorter OS of 2.6 mo than patients with low MTVm (5.3 mo). Furthermore, patients with hepatic mismatch showed a significantly (p = 0.049) shorter OS than those without (2.9 vs. 5.3 mo). Difference in OS regarding SUVmax and TLG(m) was not significant. In mCRPC patients with worsening disease during PSMA-RLT, combined [F-18]FDG and [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET imaging is essential to identify mismatch findings, as these are associated with poor outcomes requiring a change in therapy management.

Characterisation of a novel, high affinity and selective αvβ6 integrin RGD-mimetic radioligand	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Alpha-v beta-6 integrin; RGD-mimetic; Radioligand binding; Binding kinetics; RGD integrin selectivity	MOUTH-DISEASE-VIRUS; PULMONARY-FIBROSIS; TGF-BETA; BINDING; INTEGRIN-ALPHA-V-BETA-6; ALPHA(V)BETA(3); ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR; CANCER	The alpha-v beta-6 (alpha v beta 6) integrin has been identified as playing a key role in the activation of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) that is hypothesised to be pivotal in the development of cancer and fibrotic diseases. Therefore, the alpha v beta 6 integrin is an attractive therapeutic target for these debilitating diseases and a drug discovery programme to identify small molecule alpha v beta 6 selective arginyl-glycinyl-aspartic acid (RGD)-mimetics was initiated within GlaxoSmithKline. The primary aim of this study was to pharmacologically characterise the binding to alpha v beta 6 of a novel clinical candidate, compound 1, using a radiolabelled form. Radioligand binding studies were completed with [H-3]compound 1 against the human and mouse soluble protein forms of alpha v beta 6 to determine accurate affinity estimates and binding kinetics. The selectivity of compound 1 for the RGD integrin family was also determined using saturation binding studies (alpha v beta 1, alpha v beta 3, alpha v beta 5, alpha v beta 8, alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha 8 beta 1 integrins) and fibrinogen-induced platelet aggregation (alpha Ilb beta 3 integrin). In addition, the relationship between divalent metal cation type and concentration and alpha v beta 6 RGD site binding was also investigated. Compound 1 has been demonstrated to bind with extremely high affinity and selectivity for the alpha v beta 6 integrin and has the potential as a clinical tool and therapeutic for investigating the role of alpha v beta 6 in a range of disease states both pre-clinically and clinically. In addition, this is the first study that has successfully applied radioligand binding to the RGD integrin field to accurately determine the affinity and selectivity profile of a small molecule RGD-mimetic.

As a result, mGluR1 has been an important target for drug development. As a radiotracer-based in vivo imaging technique Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is an important tool in the investigation of receptor function in the living brain under normal conditions and its dysfunction in diseases, as well as in the study of receptor occupancy by experimental therapeutic agents.

While there is an increasing body of survival and other data from retrospective analyses and prospective trials, there is no clear understanding of how best to predict therapy response and survival outcomes. Objective In this retrospective cohort analysis, we aimed to identify features that are associated with response to radioligand therapy and greater survival based on analysis of real-world data. Patients and Methods 191 patients aged 70 +/- 8 years with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with radioligand therapy from November 2015 to February 2019 were included for analysis. Eligible patients had PSMA-expressing metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (confirmed by a Ga-68-PSMA-ligand positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scan), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score <= 2 and no significant kidney, liver or bone marrow dysfunction (as characterised by kidney and liver function tests and a full blood count). Patients received one to five cycles of intravenous Lu-177-PSMA-ligand therapy. Endpoints included biochemical [prostate-specific antigen (PSA)] and radiologic (PSMA PET/CT) response, progression-free survival and overall survival, defined according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 guidelines. Survival analysis was conducted by Kaplan-Meier estimation. Results Most individuals (89.5%) previously underwent first- and second-line systematic therapy. Of the 191 men treated with 452 cycles with mean injected activity of 6.1 +/- 1.0 GBq per cycle, 159 patients were assessed for a biochemical response defined as a PSA decline >= 50% from baseline. A >= 50% PSA decline was observed in 89 (56%) patients, while any PSA decline occurred in 120 (75%) men. For the entire cohort, median values (interquartile range) of overall survival [n = 191], PSA progression-free survival [n = 132] and PET/CT progression-free survival were 12 (5-18), 4 (3-8) and 6 (3-10) months, respectively. Survival analysis confirmed better outcomes in individuals who had demonstrated therapy response. Predominantly lymph node metastatic disease and chemotherapy-naive status were significant pre-therapy factors associated with longer survival. Baseline PSA was significantly linked to survival outcomes: lower levels predicted a lower risk of death and disease progression. Treatment-related adverse events included grade 3 or 4 haematological (12%), grade 1 or 2 renal (4.5%), and grade 3 or 4 clinical events (5.7%). Conclusions Our findings suggest that Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy provides a significant response rate with a low toxicity profile. The evidence promotes greater efficacy of radioligand therapy in predominantly lymph node metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and in individuals with chemotherapy-naive status and lower levels of baseline PSA.

As awareness is growing on the importance to study G protein-coupled receptors in a natural environment, we studied the effect of ghrelin in the human hepatocellular HepG2 cell line because it has been described in literature to respond to ghrelin. Despite extensive efforts, we were not able to confirm mRNA expression of GHS-R1a by reverse transcription PCR, radioligand binding, or ghrelin-induced GHS-R1a receptor activation; therefore, we conclude that HepG2 cells do not express GHS-R1a. On the other hand, we confirmed a modest effect of ghrelin on the up-regulation of IRS-1 phosphorylation, which might suggest the existence of an alternative ghrelin receptor in HepG2 cells.

Evaluation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]2FP3 in pigs and non-human primates	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						[F-18]2FP3; [H-3]SB-269970; 5-HT7 receptor; autoradiography; PET	IN-VIVO EVALUATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT7 RECEPTOR; PET; BRAIN; RADIOLIGANDS; LIGANDS	So far, no suitable 5-HT7R radioligand exists for clinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. [F-18]2FP3 was first tested in vivo in cats, and the results were promising for further evaluations. Here, we evaluate the radioligand in pigs and non-human primates (NHPs). Furthermore, we investigate species differences in 5-HT7R binding with [H-3]SB-269970 autoradiography in post-mortem pig, NHP, and human brain tissue. Specific binding of [F-18]2FP3 was investigated by intravenous administration of the 5-HT7R specific antagonist SB-269970. [H-3]SB-269970 autoradiography was performed as previously described. [F-18]2FP3 was synthesized in an overall yield of 35% to 45%. High brain uptake of the tracer was found in both pigs and NHPs; however, pretreatment with SB-269970 only resulted in decreased binding of 20% in the thalamus, a 5-HT7R-rich region. Autoradiography on post-mortem pig, NHP, and human tissues revealed that specific binding of [H-3]SB-269970 was comparable in the thalamus of pig and NHP. Despite the high uptake of [F-18]2FP3 in both species, the binding could only be blocked to a limited degree with the 5-HT7R antagonists. We speculate that the affinity of the radioligand is too low for imaging the 5-HT(7)Rs in vivo and that part of the PET signal arises from targets other than the 5-HT7R.

To develop and bioevaluate an annexin B1 based PS-targeting radiotracer, annexin B1 was radiolabeled with Tc-99m using HYNIC as a bifunctional chelator. Binding assays with activated platelets and apoptotic SP2/0 cells were carried out to evaluate the in vitro biological activity of Tc-99m-HYNIC-annexin B1. Biodistribution of this radioligand was studied in normal mice. Dexamethasone-induced murine thymus apoptosis and fas-mediated murine liver apoptosis models were used to investigate the ability of radiolabeled annexin B1 to detect apoptosis in vivo. The labeling procedure yielded a compound with up to 98% radiochemical purity and good in vitro stability. The in vitro binding assays indicated that Tc-99m-HYNIC-annexin B1 retain its PS-binding activity. Biodistribution of the compound in mice showed that Tc-99m-HYNIC-annexin B1 is rapidly cleared from the blood and predominantly accumulates in the kidney. The marked increase in dexamethasone-treated murine thymus uptake and fas-mediated murine liver uptake correlated with histologic evidence of apoptosis. These data suggested that Tc-99m-HYNIC-annexin B1 retain its in vitro and in vivo biological activities. This radiotracer may therefore be useful as a novel radioligand for the noninvasive detecting of PS externalization associated with apoptosis.

The objective of this study is to report our clinical experience with RLT using 177-lutetium-labeled PSMA-I&T. A total of 100 patients were treated under a compassionate use protocol with a total number of 319 cycles (median two cycles, range 1-6). Eligibility criteria included previous treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, previous taxane-based chemotherapy or chemoineligibility, and positive PSMA-ligand uptake at positron-emission tomography scan. The Lu-177-PSMA-I&T was given 6-8 weekly with an activity of 7.4 GBq up to six cycles. The median number of previous mCRPC regimens was 3 (range 1-6), and 35 patients had visceral metastases. Prostate-specific antigen decline of >= 50% was achieved in 38 patients, median clinical progression-free survival (cPFS) was 4.1 mo, and median overall survival (OS) was 12.9 mo. Subgroup analyses identified an association of visceral metastases with a poor prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and shorter cPFS and OS, and an association of rising lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with shorter cPFS and OS. Patients achieving PSA decline of >= 50% within 12 wk of treatment showed longer cPFS and OS. Treatment-emergent hematologic grade 3/4 toxicities were anemia (9%), thrombocytopenia (4%), and neutropenia (6%). Grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities were not observed. RLT with Lu-177-PSMA-I&T showed good activity in more than one-third of patients with late-stage mCRPC at low toxicity. Presence of visceral metastases and rising LDH were associated with worse treatment outcome. Patient summary: We analyzed the treatment outcome and toxicity of prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted radioligand therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We found that a good treatment response could be achieved in a subgroup of patients with few side effects. We also observed that treatment outcome was worse in patients with organ metastases and elevated lactate dehydrogenase in blood tests. (C) 2018 European Association of Urology.

Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) occupancy was estimated during treatment with TCA, SSRI and mirtazapine in 20 patients in remission from depression. The patients were recruited from out-patient units and deemed as responders to antidepressive treatment. The radioligand [C-11] MADAM was used to determine the 5-HTT binding potential. The mean 5-HTT occupancy was 67% (range 28-86%). There was no significant difference in 5-HTT occupancy between TCA (n = 5) and SSRI (n = 14). 5-HTT affinity correlated with the recommended clinical dose. Mirtazapine did not occupy the serotonin transporter. The results support that TCAs and SSRIs have a shared mechanism of action by inhibition of 5-HTT.

These dimers were investigated in comparison to their monomeric analogues for their dopamine D-2long, D-2short, D-3 and D-4 receptor binding. Radioligand binding experiments revealed strong bivalent effects for some para-substituted benzamide derivatives. For the D-3 subtype, the target compounds 32, 34 and 36 showed an up to 70-fold increase of affinity and a substantial enhancement of subtype selectivity when compared to the monovalent analogue 24. Analysis of the binding curves displayed Hill slopes very close to one indicating that the bivalent ligands displace 1 equiv of radioligand. Obviously, the two pharmacophores occupy an orthosteric and an allosteric binding site rather than adopting a receptor-bridging binding mode. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is the first such analysis in prostate cancer patients undergoing radioligand therapy (RLT) with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. This retrospective monocentric analysis included 91 patients with a median of 3 RLT cycles (range 1-6) and median cumulative activity of 17.3 GBq. Univariable Cox regression regarding overall survival (OS) included age, different types of previous treatment, metastatic patterns and different laboratory parameters before RLT. Based on multivariable Cox regression, a prognostic score was derived. Seventy-two patients (79%) died (median follow-up in survivors: 19.8 months). A higher number of previous chemotherapy lines, the presence of liver metastases, brain metastases, a higher tumor load on PSMA-PET, a higher prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, lower red blood cell count, lower hemoglobin, higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and higher De Ritis ratio were associated with shorter OS (each p < 0.05). In multivariable Cox, a higher number of chemotherapy lines (range, 0-2; p = 0.036), brain metastases (p < 0.001), higher PSA (p = 0.004) and higher De Ritis ratio before RLT (hazard ratio, 1.27 per unit increase; p = 0.023) remained significant. This prognostic score separated five groups with a significantly different median OS ranging from 4.9 to 28.1 months (log-rank test, p < 0.001).

Herein, alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR ligands were designed and synthesized to improve the binding affinity and selectivity of two lead compounds, (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2, for the development of an alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR tracer. The structural modification was achieved by retaining the key features and expanding the molecular structure with a benzyloxy group to increase the lipophilicity for blood-brain barrier penetration and to extend the ligand-receptor interaction. The preserved key features are a fluorine atom for radiotracer development and a p-hydroxyl motif for ligand-receptor binding affinity. Four (R)- and (S)-quinuclidine-triazole (AK1-AK4) were synthesized and the binding affinity, together with selectivity to alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR subtype, were determined by competitive radioligand binding assay using [H-3]epibatidine as a radioligand. Among all modified compounds, AK3 showed the highest binding affinity and selectivity to alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR with a K-i value of 3.18 nM, comparable to (S)-QND8 and (S)-T2 and 3069-fold higher affinity to alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR in comparison to alpha(7) nAChR. The alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR selectivity of AK3 was considerably higher than those of (S)-QND8 (11.8-fold) and (S)-T2 (294-fold). AK3 was shown to be a promising alpha(3)beta(4) nAChR tracer for further development as a radiotracer for drug addiction.

Methods: Alignment, simulated peptide-cut, bioinformatics and protease digestion were used to screen and prepare antagonist peptide. Interactions between C18P and CCR1 were determined by radioligand binding assays and [S-35] GTP gamma S binding experiment. Chemotaxis assay was utilized to assess the potency for inducing or inhibiting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) migration. Ligand-induced intracellular calcium mobilization was tested by flow cytometry. Results: A peptide containing 18 amino acids (C18P) was screened. C18P bound to CCR1 with a Kd of 5.7 ng/ml and displaced I-125-labeled MIP-1 alpha and I-125-labeled RANTES on human CCR1-transfected HEK293 cells (IC50 = 11.2 and 9.6 ng/ml, respectively) in radioligand binding studies. C18P lacked intrinsic agonist activity but strongly inhibited HCC-1 (100 nM) induced [S-35] GTP gamma S binding (IC50 = 3.7 ug/ml), chemotaxis induced by HCC-1, MIP-1a and RANTES (IC50 = 23, 25 and 13.1 ng/ml, respectively), and intracellular calcium mobilization. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that bioinformatics and protease digestion are feasible to screen and prepare C18P, and that C18P is a novel and specific small molecule peptide antagonist of CCR1 with therapeutic potential for preventing cell migration.

Approaches to Multireceptor Targeting: Hybrid Radioligands, Radioligand Cocktails, and Sequential Radioligand Applications	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neuroendocrine tumors; quantitative autoradiography; heterobivalent ligands; cocktail approach; tumor heterogeneity	PEPTIDE RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; HETEROBIVALENT LIGANDS; SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR; PROSTATE-CANCER; BREAST-CANCER; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; HIGH EXPRESSION; MOLECULAR-BASIS; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y	Modern drug discovery highly depends on the identification and validation of the drug targets. Using the method of in vitro quantitative receptor autoradiography, we demonstrated that for instance, in neuroendocrine tumors-up to 3 receptors can be coexpressed at a relatively high density. In addition, nonendocrine tumors such as breast, prostate, and brain tumors concomitantly express several G protein-coupled receptors at a high density. We propose 3 strategies for exploiting these findings for multireceptor targeting in vivo: use of heterobivalent or heteromultivalent ligands, which may bind simultaneously or monovalently to their different molecular targets; coinjection of a cocktail of radioligands; and sequential injection of different radioligands. Any of these strategies may help to remedy some of the major problems in cancer targeting: heterogeneity, change in phenotype during disease progression, and resistance.

Drug-treated animals exhibited a 30% increase in d-threo- [H-3]methylphenidate binding to the DAT in the striatum relative to controls. No changes in specific binding of (+)-alpha-[H-3]dihydrotetrabenazine were observed in any brain region following scopolamine pretreatment. Cholinergic drugs thus differentially affect in vivo specific binding of DAT and VMAT2 radioligands, suggesting this should be a consideration in selection of in vivo markers for imaging studies of dopaminergic terminals in the brain of animals and humans.

A halogen replacement analogue (I-Mex2) of a known high affinity melanocortin-4 receptor selective compound resulted. It showed a subnanomolar affinity when evaluated on the melanocortin-4 receptor in competition with the alpha-MSH peptide analogue I-125-NDP-MSH. By treatment with hexamethylditin and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium I-Mex2 was converted to the corresponding trimethylstannyl derivative. In the next step, (NaI)-I-125 was oxidized by an iodobead. Iododestannylation proceeded in the presence of 1 M phosphate buffer, pH 2.5, and the radioactive derivative I-125-Mex2 formed was separated by HPLC at 40% radiochemical yield. Preliminary investigation showed that I-125-Mex2 is useful as a radioligand for melanocortin-4 receptor binding studies. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Methods: Ex vivo biodistribution and pharmacology were tested in mice. PET imaging was performed in mice, beagle dogs and a baboon. To assess nonspecific binding, PET imaging was performed both before and after pretreatment with a potent AT(1)R antagonist. In the baboon, PET imaging was also performed with the previously developed radioligand [C-11]L-159,884 for comparison. Results: Ex vivo biodistribution studies in mice showed specific binding rates of 80-90% in the adrenals, kidneys, lungs and heart. Specific binding was confirmed in mice using small animal PET. In dogs, renal cortex tissue concentration at 75-95 min postinjection (pi) was 63 nCi/ ml per millicurie at a specific binding rate of 95%. In the baboon renal cortex, tissue activity at 55-75 min pi was 345 nCi/ml per millicurie. In the baboon the specific binding of [C-11]KR31173 was higher (81%) than the specific binding of [C-11]L-159,884 (34%). Conclusion: [C-11]KR31173 shows accumulation and significant specific binding to the AT(1)R in the kidneys of mice, dogs and baboon. These findings suggest that this radioligand is suited for imaging the renal cortical AT(1)R in multiple species. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The density of dopamine D1-like receptors and the affinity of [H-3]SCH 23390 and [H-3]7OH-DPAT binding to PBL were similar in both groups investigated. AD patients revealed a lower density of dopamine D2-like receptors on PBL than controls (P = 0.0016). The pharmacological profile of [H-3]SCH 23390 and [H-3]7OH-DPAT binding to PBL was consistent with the labeling of dopamine D5 and D3 receptor subtypes, respectively. The reduced density of dopamine D2-like receptors on PBL is consistent with the observation of changes in the expression of D2-like receptors in dopaminergic brain areas in AD. Our findings support the hypothesis of an involvement of dopamine in AD, even in those patients with no evidence of Parkinson-ism, behavioral abnormalities or psychosis.

The high polarity of the gallium 4-N-alkylgemctiabine-NOTA complex resulted in rapid renal clearance of the 68 Ga-labelled radioligand in BALB/c mice.

Crude extracts of the leaves have shown affinity to the SSRI site on the serotonin transporter in a radioligand binding assay. In this study, two compounds, buphanadrine and buphanamine, were isolated by bioassay-guided fractionation on VLC and preparative TLC. The structures of the compounds were determined by H-1 and C-13 NMR. Fractions were tested for affinity to the serotonin transporter in a binding assay using [H-3]-citalopram as ligand. The IC50 values of buphanidrine and buphanamine were 274 mu M (K-i = 132 mu M) and 1799 mu M (K-i = 868 mu M), respectively. The two alkaloids were also tested for affinity to the 5HT(1A) receptor, but only showed slight affinity. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Improved protocol for the radiosynthesis of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FTC-146: A potent and selective sigma-1 receptor radioligand	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						[F-18]FTC-146; positron emission tomography (PET); radiochemical yield; radio-fluorination; sigma-1 receptor (sigma 1R)	IMMUNOGLOBULIN-G EXPRESSION; CELL; PROLIFERATION; GENE; IGG	[F-18]FTC-146 was introduced as a very potent and selective sigma-1 receptor radioligand, which has shown promising application as an imaging agent for neuropathic pain with positron emission tomography. In line with a multi-laboratory project on animal welfare, we chose this radioligand to investigate its potential for detecting neuropathic pain and tissue damage in tumor-bearing animals. However, the radiochemical yield (RCY) of around 4-7% was not satisfactory to us, and efforts were made to improve it. Herein, we describe an improved approach for the radiosynthesis of [F-18]FTC-146 resulting in a RCY, which is sevenfold higher than that previously reported. A tosylate precursor was synthesized and radio-fluorination experiments were performed via aliphatic nucleophilic substitution reactions using either K[F-18]F-Kryptofix (R) 222 (K-2.2.2)-carbonate system or tetra-n-butylammonium [F-18]fluoride ([F-18]TBAF). Several parameters affecting the radiolabeling reaction such as solvent, F-18-fluorination agent with the corresponding amount of base, labeling time, and temperature were investigated. Best labeling reaction conditions were found to be [F-18]TBAF and acetonitrile as solvent at 100 & DEG;C. The new protocol was then translated to an automated procedure using a FX2 N synthesis module. Finally, the radiotracer reproducibly obtained with RCYs of 41.7 +/- 4.4% in high radiochemical purity (> 98%) and molar activities up to 171 GBq/mu mol.

In the present work, a series of functionalized esters structurally related to acetylcholine and nicotine were synthesized and pharmacologically assayed with respect to these targets. The synthesized compounds were studied in radioligand binding assays at alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR, h-SERT and h-DAT. SERT experiments showed not radioligand [H-3]-paroxetine displacement, but rather an increase in the radioligand binding percentage at the central binding site was observed. Compound 20 showed K-i values of 1.008 +/- 0.230 mu M for h-DAT and 0.031 +/- 0.006 mu M for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR, and [H-3]-paroxetine binding of 191.50% in h-SERT displacement studies, being the only compound displaying triple affinity. Compound 21 displayed K-i values of 0.113 +/- 0.037 mu M for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR and 0.075 +/- 0.009 mu M for h-DAT acting as a dual ligand. Molecular docking studies on homology models of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR, h-DAT and h-SERT suggested potential interactions among the compounds and agonist binding site at the alpha 4/beta 2 subunit interfaces of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR, central binding site of h-DAT and allosteric modulator effect in h-SERT.

However, the relationship between PSMA levels and intralesion heterogeneity of PSMA expression, and cytotoxic radiation by radioligand therapy (RLT) is unknown. Here we investigate RLT efficacy as function of PSMA levels/cell, and the fraction of PSMA(+) cells in a tumor. Experimental Design: RM1 cells expressing different levels of PSMA(PSMA(-), PSMA(+), PSMA(++), PSMA(+++); study 1) or a mix of PSMA(+) and PSMA(-) RM1 (study 2, 4) or PC-3/PC-3-PIP (study 3) cells at various ratios were injected into mice. Mice received Lu-177(studies 1-3) or Ac-225- (study 4) PSMA617. Tumor growth was monitored. Two days post-RLT, tumors were resected in a subset of mice. Radioligand uptake and DNA damage were quantified. Results: Lu-177-PSMA617 efficacy increased with increasing PSMA levels (study 1) and fractions of PSMA positive cells (studies 2, 3) in both, the RM1 and PC-3-PIP models. In tumors resected 2 days post-RLT, PSMAexpression correlated with Lu-177-PSMA617 uptake and the degree of DNA damage. Compared with Lu-177-PSMA617, Ac-225-PSMA617 improved overall antitumor effectiveness and tended to enhance the differences in therapeutic efficacy between experimental groups. Conclusions: In the current models, both the degree of PSMA expression and the fraction of PSMA(+) cells correlate with Lu-177-/Ac-225-PSMA617 tumor uptake and DNA damage, and thus, RLT efficacy. Low or heterogeneous PSMA expression represents a resistance mechanism to RLT.

Novel fluorescent antagonist as a molecular probe in A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor binding assays using flow cytometry	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Purines; Fluorescence; G protein-coupled receptor; A(3) adenosine receptor; Flow cytometry	GPCR LIGANDS; DERIVATIVES; THERAPY; DISEASE; CELLS	The physiological role of the A(3) adenosine receptor (AR) was explored in cardiac ischaemia, inflammatory diseases and cancer. We report a new fluorophore-conjugated human (h) A(3)AR antagonist for application to cell-based assays in ligand discovery and for receptor imaging. Fluorescent pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5-ylamine (pyrazolo-triazolo-pyrimidine, PTP) and triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-yl)amine (triazolo-quinazoline, TQ) AR antagonists were compared. A chain-extended and click-conjugated Alexa Fluor-488 TQ derivative (MRS5449) displayed a radioligand binding K-i value of 6.4 +/- 2.5 nM in hA(3)AR-expressing CHO cell membranes. MRS5449 antagonized hA(3)AR agonist-induced inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner (K-B = 4.8 nM). Using flow cytometry (FCM), MRS5449 saturated hA(3)ARs with very high specific-to-nonspecific binding ratio with an equilibrium binding constant 5.15 nM, comparable to the K-d value of 6.65 nM calculated from kinetic experiments. K-i values of known AR antagonists in inhibition of MRS5449 binding in whole cell FCM were consistent with radioligand binding in membranes, but agonist binding was 5-20 fold weaker than obtained with agonist radioligand [I-125]I-AB-MECA. Further binding analysis of MRS5549 suggested multiple agonist binding states of the A(3)AR. Molecular docking predicted binding modes of these fluorescent antagonists. Thus, MRS5449 is a useful tool for hA(3)AR characterization. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Kozma, Eszter; Kumar, T.

For the purpose of prospective 5-HT1A receptor imaging with positron emission tomography and the investigation of radioligand metabolic pathways, S14506 was labeled with a positron emitter, either carbon-11 (t(1/2)=20.4min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2)=109.7min), at different positions. Thus, [O-methyl-C-11]S14506 was obtained in a radiosynthesis time of 35min by treating O-desmethyl-S14506 with [C-11]iodomethane and tetrabutylammonium hydroxide in N,N-dimethylformamide. The overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield (RCY) of [O-methyl-C-11]S14506 ranged between 6 and 24% and the specific activity (SA) between 1343 and 3101 Ci/mmol (mean 2390; n=30). [carbonyl-C-11]S14506 was synthesized through a microwave-enhanced direct coupling of in situ generated [C-11]organocarboxymagnesium bromide with amine precursor. RCYs ranged from 10 to 18%. [F-18]S14506 was prepared via nucleophilic aromatic fluoridation of the 4-nitro analog in 14 35% RCY and with SA ranging from 1063 to 2302Ci/mmol (mean 1617; n=14) in a radiosynthesis time of 115min. Heating the radiofluoridation mixture for 5min at 180 degrees C in a single mode microwave cavity gave similar RCY and SA to heating for 30 min in an oil bath at the same temperature.

J	Baker, ER; Zwart, R; Sher, E; Millar, NS				Baker, ER; Zwart, R; Sher, E; Millar, NS			Pharmacological properties of α9α10 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors revealed by heterologous expression of subunit chimeras	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN RECEPTORS; COCHLEAR HAIR-CELLS; CHOLINERGIC-RECEPTOR; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; EPSILON SUBUNIT; UP-REGULATION; CHICK RETINA; BINDING; IDENTIFICATION; SUBTYPES	The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha9 and alpha10 subunits are expressed primarily within hair cells of the inner ear and have been implicated in auditory processing. Although functional recombinant nAChRs generated by the coexpression of alpha9 and alpha10 in Xenopus laevis oocytes have been described previously, there have been no reports of the successful heterologous expression of alpha9alpha10 nAChRs in cultured cell lines. In this study, subunit chimeras (alpha9chi and alpha10chi) have been constructed that contain the extracellular, ligand binding domain of the alpha9 or alpha10 subunits fused to the C-terminal domain of the 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3A (5HT(3A)) subunit. Specific high-affinity binding of the nicotinic radioligand [(3)H] methyllycaconitine was detected in membrane preparations of mammalian cells transfected with alpha9chi or alpha10chi alone, but significantly higher levels of binding were detected when alpha9chi and alpha10chi were cotransfected, providing evidence of a requirement for coassembly of alpha9 and alpha10 for the efficient formation of a nicotinic binding site. The pharmacological profile of alpha9alpha10chi receptors, determined by equilibrium radioligand binding studies, is broadly similar to that determined previously by electrophysiological studies conducted with native and recombinant alpha9alpha10 nAChRs. In agreement with evidence that alpha9alpha10 nAChRs exhibit an atypical pharmacological profile, we have identified specific high-affinity binding of several non-nicotinic ligands including strychnine (a glycine receptor antagonist), bicuculline (a GABA(A) receptor antagonist), and atropine ( a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist). Results have also been compared with radioligand binding data conducted with a previously described alpha7/5HT(3A) (alpha7chi) subunit chimera.

Adenine and purine-based adenosine receptor antagonists have been reported in literature. In this work we combined various substituents in the 2, 6, and 8-positions of 9-ethylpurine to depict a structure-affinity relationship analysis at the human adenosine receptors. Compounds were rationally designed trough molecular modeling analysis and then synthesized and evaluated at radioligand binding studies at human adenosine receptors. The new compounds showed affinity for the human adenosine receptors, with some derivatives endowed with low nanomolar K-i data, in particular at the A(2A)AR subtype. The purine core proves to be a versatile core structure for the development of novel adenosine receptor antagonists with nanomolar affinity for these membrane proteins.

It has a crucial role in most brain functions under physiological conditions through the activation of both ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. In addition, extracellular glutamate concentration is tightly regulated through different excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT). Glutamate neurotransmission is also involved in the neurotoxic effects of many environmental chemicals and drugs. Furthermore, homeostatic changes in glutamate neurotransmission appear in response to prolonged block/enhancement of electrical activity. Here, we describe different approaches to evaluate alterations in glutamate neurotransmission regarding glutamate receptors and glutamate transporters by using primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes. The methods are based on the increased fluorescence of calcium-sensitive probes in response to glutamate agonists, on radioligand binding to glutamate receptors and transport sites, and on inmunocytochemistry visualization of glutamate receptors.

Understanding of Molecular Substructures that Contribute to hERG K<SUP>+</SUP> Channel Blockade: Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of E-4031 Analogues	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article						E-4031; hERG; ion channels; patch clamp assay; radioligand binding; structure-activity relationships	POTASSIUM CHANNELS; BINDING	Cardiotoxicity is a common side effect of a large variety of drugs that is often caused by off-target human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel blockade. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of derivatives of the class III antiarrhythmic agent E-4031. These compounds where evaluated in a radioligand binding assay and automated patch clamp assay to establish structureactivity relationships (SAR) for their inhibition of the hERG K+ channel. Structural modifications of E-4031 were made by altering the peripheral aromatic moieties with a series of distinct substituents. Additionally, we synthesized several derivatives with a quaternary nitrogen and modified the center of the molecule by introduction of an additional nitrogen and deletion of the carbonyl oxygen. Some modifications caused a great increase in affinity for the hERG K+ channel, while other seemingly minor changes led to a strongly diminished affinity. Structures with quaternary amines carrying an additional aromatic moiety were found to be highly active in radioligand binding assay. A decrease in affinity was achieved by introducing an amide functionality in the central scaffold without directly interfering with the pKa of the essential basic amine. The knowledge gained from this study could be used in early stages of drug discovery and drug development to avoid or circumvent hERG K+ channel blockade, thereby reducing the risk of cardiotoxicity, related arrhythmias and sudden death.

The density of striatal dopamine D-2 receptors is reduced in HD but there is little known about this biomarker in brain regions outside the striatum. The primary objective of this study was to compare extrastriatal dopamine D-2 receptor binding, in age-matched control subjects and patients with HD. All subjects were examined using a high-resolution positron emission tomography system and the high-affinity dopamine D-2 receptor radioligand [C-11]FLB 457. A ROI based analysis was used with an atrophy correction method. Dopamine D-2 receptor binding potential was reduced in the striatum of patients with HD. Unlike the striatum, dopamine D-2 receptor binding in thalamic and cortical subregions was not significantly different from that in control subjects. A partial least square regression analysis which included binding potential values from all investigated cortical and subcortical regions revealed a significant model separating patients from controls, conclusively dependent on differences in striatal binding of the radioligand. Some clinical assessments correlated with striatal dopamine D-2 receptor binding, including severity of chorea and cognitive test performance. Hence, the present study demonstrates that dopamine D-2 receptors extrinsic to the striatum are well preserved in early to mid stage patients with HD. This observation may have implication for the development of therapy for HD. Hum Brain Mapp 32: 1626-1636, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We aimed to quantitatively assess the specificity of the second-generation TSPO PET radioligand, [C-11]PBR28, and to generate simplified PET protocols in patients with inflammatory joint disease (IJD) in this pilot study. Methods: Three IJD patients (two rheumatoid arthritis and one osteoarthritis) with knee involvement underwent dynamic [C-11]PBR28-PET scans before and after administration of 90 mg of oral emapunil (XBD-173), a TSPO ligand the same day. Radial arterial blood sampling was performed throughout the scan, and total radioactivity and radioactive metabolites were obtained. A semi-automated method was used to generate regions of interest. Standardized uptake value (SUV) and SUV ratio corrected for activity in bone and blood between 50 and 70 min (SUVr(50-70) bone, SUVr(50-70) blood, respectively) and PET volume of distribution (V-T) of the radioligand were calculated. Results A mean [C-11]PBR28 radioactivity of 378 (range 362-389) MBq was administered. A significant decrease (p < 0.05) in V-T, SUVr(50-70) bone and SUVr(50-70) blood observed after oral emapunil confirmed the TSPO specificity of [C-11]PBR28. A decrease in SUV was not observed in the post-block scan. Conclusion [C-11]PBR28 is TSPO-specific radioligand in IJD patients. Simplified PET protocols with static PET acquisition can be used in the management and evaluation of novel therapeutics that target TSPO overexpressing cells.

Triptorelin-Hydrazide analogue was synthesized using solid phase. For In-111 labeling, synthesized peptide was followed by conjugation with DOTA using pSCN-Bn-DOTA. The conjugated Triptorelin-Hydrazide was labeled with 500-550MBq of In-111-chloride (in 0.2M HCl). At optimized conditions after labeling, radio-chromatography showed radiochemical purity of approximately equal to 98% (RTLC) and greater than 95% (HPLC). The serum stability of the tracer was determined up to 24hr. Binding affinities of Triptorelin-Hydrazide analogue were determined in a binding assay for both human and rat GnRH receptors. For in vivo studies, In-111-peptide was injected intravenously via the tail vein into rats and significant ovaries uptake consist with reported GnRH receptor mappings. In vitro radioligand binding assays performed with GnRHR-expressing human cell lines using I-125-Triptorelin as the standard radioligand. The quantities of internalization efficiency and receptor affinity of the new radioligand were IC50=0.20 +/- 0.04nM vs 0.13 +/- 0.08nM for Triptorelin and internalization: 3.5 +/- 0.9% at 1hr and 12.8 +/- 1.8% at 4hr of the internal reference.

They are delta-opioid receptor-selective agonists. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a peptide, Tyr-D-Ala-(pI)Phe-Glu-Ile-Ile-Gly-NH2 3 (GATE3-8), based on the [D-Ala(2)]deltorphin II template, which is delta-selective in in vitro radioligand binding assays over the mu- and kappa-opioid receptors. It is a full agonist in [S-35]GTP gamma S functional assays and analgesic when administered supraspinally to mice. Analgesia of 3 (GATE3-8) is blocked by the selective delta receptor antagonist naltrindole, indicating that the analgesic action of 3 is mediated by the d-opioid receptor. We have established a radioligand in which I-125 is incorporated into 3 (GATE3-8). The radioligand has a K-D of 0.1 nM in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the d receptor. Additionally, a series of peptides based on 3 (GATE3-8) was synthesized by incorporating various halogens in the para position on the aromatic ring of Phe(3). The peptides were characterized for binding affinity at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors, which showed a linear correlation between binding affinity and the size of the halogen substituent. These peptides may be interesting tools for probing delta-opioid receptor pharmacology.

Toremifene [TOR; 4-chloro-1,2-diphenyl-1-(4-(2-(N,N-di-methylamino)ethoxy)phenyl)-1-butene, as citrate salt] was selected as the starting material to be derived, since it has been used extensively as an antiestrogen drug for treatment and prevention of human breast cancer. An antiestrogen drug derivative, TOR attached to diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), was synthesized by two experimental treatments, including a purification and a reaction step. We described the synthesis of this TOR derivative, (3Z)-4-{4-[2-(dimethylamino) ethoxy] phenyl}-3,4-diphenylbut-3-en-1-ylN,N-bis[2-(2,6-dioxomorpholin-4-yl)ethyl]glycinate (TOR-DTPA), in detail. Mass spectroscopy confirmed the expected structures. TOR-DTPA was labeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m), using stannous chloride (SnCl2) as the reducing agent. Biodistribution studies were performed on female Albino Wistar rats. Quality controls, radiochemical yield, and stability studies were done utilizing high-performance liquid chromatography, radioelectrophoresis, thin-layer chromatography, and thin-layer radiochromatography methods. The synthesized compound was found to be hydrophilic and anionic, with high stability for the duration of the testing period in vitro. The results indicated that the radiolabeled compound has estrogen-receptor specificity, especially for the breast tissue. It is highly possible that this compound could be used for imaging breast tumors as a novel technetium-labeled hydrophilic estrogen derivative radioligand.

We report the C-11-labeling of vortioxetine with [C-11] MeI using a Suzuki-protocol that allows for the presence of an unprotected amine. Preliminary evaluation of [C-11] vortioxetine in a Danish Landrace pig showed rapid brain uptake and brain distribution in accordance with the pharmacological profile, all though an unexpected high binding in cerebellum was also observed. [C-11] vortioxetine displayed slow tracer kinetics with peak uptake after 60 min and with limited wash-out from the brain. Further studies are needed but this radioligand may prove to be a valuable tool in unraveling the clinical effects of vortioxetine. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the biochemical, clinical and radiological data of patients received treatment with 177-Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in our clinic following the diagnosis of mCRPC, and to investigate the relationship between treatment timing and metastasis region and survival. Material and methods: This is a retrospective, observational, single-center study from December 2016 to December 2019. Patients underwent 177-Lu-PSMA-617 RLT with a diagnosis of mCRPC. We used the Kaplan-Meier test and the Cox regression proportional hazard test to assess survival data. Results: 95 patients with an average age of 70.45 (50-85) were evaluated retrospectively. Median follow-up was 10.86 months (8.15-11.94 months) and the median lines of 177-Lu-PSMA-617 RLT treatment was 4 (1 to 5). Median overall survival was found to be 17.03 +/- 5.78 months in the patients receiving the treatment at the third or lower lines while it was 10.30 +/- 0.93 months in patients receiving the treatment at the fourth or higher lines (p = 0.021). When evaluating patients with only bone metastasis and patients with bone and lymph node metastasis, the median overall survival was 11.46 +/- 0.87 months and 12.13 +/- 3.02 months (p = 0.445), respectively.

They can be located in every tissue, but most commonly in gastrointestinal tract. Targeted therapy with use of radionuclides is an available and acceptable way of treatment, but its long-term safety is still to be determined, especially with sensitive methods. Methods: Study was performed on a group of 42 patients. They underwent full cycle (4 courses; 8-12 weekly intervals) of radioligand therapy with [Lu-177]Lu-DOTATATE alone or tandem therapy with [Lu-177]Lu-DOTATATE+[Y-90]Y-DOTATATE. Late and long-term marrow and renal complications were assessed. Analysis focused on comparing data before first, fourth, and one year after the last course of RLT. Results: Study showed decreasing of all blood parameters in long-term observation, especially in lymphocytes line. Type of radioisotope, other diseases, primary tumor location, BMI, gender or age did not affect results. The only factor that had influence on hemoglobin and erythrocytes was decreased renal filtration. In long-term observation almost 10% decrease of renal filtration was observed. Type of isotope, gender, age, BMI did not affect these results. Moreover, reduction of urine IL-18, KIM-1, and albumin concentration has been observed. Conclusions: Though low-grade complications of radioligand therapy are possible, it stay a safe method of NEN treatment where benefits outweigh the risk.

However, whole-body tumor dosimetry is challenging in patients with a high tumor burden. We evaluate a simplified index-lesion-based single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) dosimetry method in correlation with clinical outcome. Methods: 30 mCRPC patients were included (median 71 years). The dosimetry was performed for the first cycle using quantitative Lu-177-SPECT. The response was evaluated using RECIST 1.1 and PERCIST criteria, as well as changes in PSMA-positive tumor volume (PSMA-TV) in post-therapy PSMA-PET and biochemical response according to PSA changes after two RLT cycles. Results: Mean tumor doses as well as index-lesion doses were significantly higher in PERCIST responders compared to non-responders (10.2 +/- 12.0 Gy/GBq vs. 4.0 +/- 2.9 Gy/GBq, p = 0.03 and 13.7 +/- 14.2 Gy/GBq vs. 5.9 +/- 4.4 Gy/GBq, p = 0.04, respectively). No significant differences in mean tumor and index lesion doses were observed between responders and non-responders according to RECIST 1.1, PSMA-TV, and biochemical response criteria. Conclusion: Compared to mean tumor doses on a patient level, single index-lesion-based SPECT dosimetry correlates equally well with the response to PSMA-RLT according to PERCIST criteria and may represent a fast and feasible dosimetry approach for clinical routine.

The purpose of this study was to determine the most appropriate kinetic model to quantify [C-11]AFM binding in the healthy human brain. Positron emission tomography data and arterial input functions were acquired from 10 subjects. Compartmental modeling and the multilinear analysis-1(MA1) method were tested using the arterial input functions. The one-tissue model showed a lack of fit in low-binding regions, and the two-tissue model failed to estimate parameters reliably. Regional time-activity curves were well described by MA1. The rank order of [C-11]AFM binding potential (BPND) matched well with the known regional SERT densities. For routine use of [C-11]AFM, several noninvasive methods for quantification of regional binding were evaluated, including simplified reference tissue models (SRTM and SRTM2), and multilinear reference tissue models (MRTM and MRTM2). The best methods for region of interest (ROI) analysis were MA1, MRTM2, and SRTM2, with fixed population kinetic values (k(2)' or b') for the reference methods. The MA1 and MRTM2 methods were best for parametric imaging. These results showed that [C-11]AFM is a suitable PET radioligand to image and quantify SERT in humans.

Endogenous dopamine or serotonin may compete with radioligand binding at monoamine transporters. We used alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) to block dopamine production and measured [I-123]beta-CIT binding before and after endogenous dopamine was restored by IV administration of the dopamine precursor L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) in rhesus monkeys. P-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) was used to inhibit serotonin production, and [I-123]beta-CIT binding was assessed before and after IV administration of the serotonin precursor 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan (L-5-HTP) restored endogenous serotonin. Pretreatment with benserazide blocked peripheral decarboxylization in both paradigms. Serotonin restoration measurably displaced [I-123]beta-CIT binding to brainstem serotonin transporters but not to striatal dopamine transporters. Restoration of dopamine apparently did not affect [I-123]beta-CIT binding to striatal dopamine transporters. However, dopamine restoration reduced radioligand binding to brainstem serotonin transporters, most likely due to dopamine release from serotonin neurons following L-DOPA administration. The higher striatal density of dopamine transporters relative to dopamine concentrations may explain why [I-123]beta-CIT displacement by endogenous dopamine was not observed. This study indicates that [I-123]beta-CIT binding in brainstem (raphe area) is affected by endogenous serotonin release in vivo and that L-DOPA treatment may cause serotonin neurons in the brainstem to corelease dopamine.

The PET radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MePPEP binds reversibly and with high specific signal to cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in nonhuman primate brain	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cannabinoid; CB1 receptors; [C-11]MePPEP; kinetic analysis; PET	P-GLYCOPROTEIN; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; IN-VIVO; RAT; BIODISTRIBUTION; QUANTIFICATION; BARRIER; MODEL	The cannabinoid CB1 receptor is one of the most abundant G protein-coupled receptors in the brain and is a promising target of therapeutic drug development. Success of drug development for neuropsychiatric indications is significantly enhanced with the ability to directly measure spatial and temporal binding of compounds to receptors in central compartments. We assessed the utility of a new positron emission tomography ( PET) radioligand to image CB1 receptors in monkey brain. [C-11]MePPEP ((3R,5R)-5-(3-methoxy-phenyl)-3-((R)-1-phenyl-ethylamino)-1-(4-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-pyrrolidin-2-one) has high CB1 affinity (K-b = 0.574 +/- 0.207 nM) but also moderately high lipophilicity ( measured LogD(7.4) = 4.8). After intravenous injection of [C-11] MePPEP, brain activity reached high levels of almost 600% standardized uptake value (SUV) within 10-20 min. The regional uptake was consistent with the distribution of CB1 receptors, with high radioactivity in striatum and cerebellum and low in thalamus and pons. Injection of pharmacological doses of CB1-selective agents confirmed that the tracer doses of [ 11 C] MePPEP reversibly labeled CB1 receptors. Preblockade or displacement with two CB1 selective agents (ISPB; (4-(3-cyclopentyl-indole-1-sulfonyl)-N-(tetrahydro-pyran-4-ylmethyl)-benzamide) and rimonabant) showed that the majority (> 89%) of brain uptake in regions with high receptor densities was specific and reversibly bound to CB1 receptors in the high binding regions. [C-11] MePPEP was rapidly removed from arterial plasma. Regional brain uptake could be quantified as distribution volume relative to the concentration of parent radiotracer in plasma. The P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor DCPQ (( R)4-[(1a,6,10b)-1,1-dichloro-1,1a,6,10b-tetrahydrodibenzo[a,e]cyclopropa[c]cyclohepten-6-yl]-[(5-quinolinyloxy) methyl]-1- piperazineethanol) did not significantly increase brain uptake of [C-11] MePPEP, suggesting it is not a substrate for this efflux transporter at the blood - brain barrier. [C-11] MePPEP is a radioligand with high brain uptake, high specific signal to CB1 receptors, and adequately fast washout from brain that allows quantification with (11C) (half-life = 20 min). These promising results in monkey justify studying this radioligand in human subjects.

Methods: The brain study was conducted in 4 female rhesus monkeys. PET measurements were conducted for 243 min using the high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) with the measurement of the metabolite-corrected arterial input function and protein binding. Quantification was performed with kinetic analysis using 2-tissue- and 1-tissue-compartment models, with Logan graphical analysis and with different reference tissue models. The outcome measures were total distribution volume (V-T), nondisplaceable distribution volume (V-ND), binding potential relative to the free concentration of radioligand in plasma (BPF), and binding potential relative to the concentration of nondisplaceable radioligand in tissue (BPND) = V-T - V-ND/V-ND using the cerebellum as a reference region. For the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry, 2 female cynomolgus monkeys were studied. Whole-body PET scans were obtained using a PET/CT system for approximately 250 min. Estimates of the absorbed radiation dose in humans were calculated using OLINDA/EXM software. Results: F-18-LBT-999 showed good brain uptake (300% standardized uptake value) and regional distribution according to known DAT density. The 2-tissue-compartment model was the preferred model for the quantification. Late peak equilibrium (120-140 min) and slow washout were observed in the striatum, with high variability of V-T, BPF, and BPND. When the different models were compared with the 2-tissue-compartment model, the underestimation of V-T or BPND was larger in the caudate and putamen than in the midbrain and thalamus. The reference tissue models were suitable for the quantification. The whole-body distribution study showed that the main routes of excretion of F-18-LBT-999 were the urinary and gastrointestinal systems, with the bladder being the critical organ. Accumulation of F-18-LBT-999 was found in the bone and skull, with a relatively high dose estimated for the osteogenic cells. The range of calculated effective dose was 0.021-0.022 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: F-18-LBT-999 seemed to be a suitable PET radioligand for the DAT quantification, particularly for extrastriatal regions. The skull uptake did not seem to be a limitation for brain imaging. The calculated dosimetry estimates based on data in nonhuman primates seemed comparable with those of other clinically used F-18-labeled radioligands, for example, F-18-FDG (0.024-0.027 mSv/MBq).

Synthesis and evaluation of novel radioiodinated PSMA targeting ligands for potential radiotherapy of prostate cancer	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Prostate cancer; Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA); Radioligand therapy (RLT); Radioiodine; Pharmacokinetics	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; BINDING; OPTIMIZATION; INHIBITORS; DIAGNOSIS	Radioligand therapy (RLT) using prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeting ligands is an attractive option for the treatment of Prostate cancer (PCa) and its metastases. We report herein a series of radioiodinated glutamate-urea-lysine-phenylalanine derivatives as new PSMA ligands in which L-tyrosine and L-glutamic acid moieties were added to increase hydrophilicity concomitant with improvement of in vivo targeting properties. Compounds 8, 15, 19a/19b and 23a/23b were synthesized and radiolabeled with I-125 by iododestannylation. All iodinated compounds displayed high binding affinities toward PSMA (IC50 = 1-13 nM). In vitro cell uptake studies demonstrated that compounds containing an L-tyrosine linker moiety (8, 15 and 19a/19b) showed higher internalization than MIP-1095 and 23a/23b, both without the L-tyrosine linker moiety. Biodistribution studies in mice bearing PC3-PIP and PC3 xenografts showed that [I-125]8 and [I-125]15 with higher lipophilicity exhibited higher nonspecific accumulations in the liver and intestinal tract, whereas [I-125]19a/19b and [I-125]23a/23b containing additional glutamic acid moieties showed higher accumulations in the kidney and implanted PC3-PIP (PSMA+) tumors. [I-125]23b displayed a promising biodistribution profile with favorable tumor retention, fast clearance from the kidney, and 2-3-fold lower uptake in the liver and blood than that observed for [I-125]MIP-1095. [I-125/131]23b may serve as an optimal PSMA ligand for radiotherapy treatment of prostate cancer over-expressing PSMA.

Two membrane preparations were made: (1) longitudinal muscle containing the myenteric plexus and (2) circular muscle containing the interstitial cells of Cajal. In saturation binding studies, the K-D was estimated as 1.3 and 1.0 nmol/l in each preparation, respectively. In competition binding, the rank order of potency was similar in both membrane preparations: SR140333 approximate to CP99994 greater than or equal to [Sar(9),Met(O-2)(11)]SP approximate to physalaemin approximate to CP96345 (pIC(50) 9.5-8.7) much greater than neuropeptide gamma greater than or equal to septide (pIC(50) 7.8-7.4). Similarly, scyliorhinin I displayed equal affinity in both preparations, although binding was at two sites, of high affinity (pIC(50) 9.1, 30%) and low affinity (pIC(50) 7.2-6.6, 70%). The only competitor to bind differently in the two muscle preparations was scyliorhinin 11, which bound to one site with low potency in the circular muscle (pIC(50) 6.9) but to high-affinity (pIC(50) 9.0, 17%) and low-affinity (pIC(50) 6.7, 83%) sites in the longitudinal muscle. In autoradiographic studies, dense specific binding was associated with the myenteric plexus and the inner circular muscle containing the interstitial cells of Cajal, with minimal specific binding to longitudinal and circular smooth muscle. These results suggest that the NK-1 receptor on the interstitial cells and the myenteric plexus is similar. The apparently low numbers of binding sites on intestinal smooth muscle may be due to a low expression of the NK-1 receptor. Alternatively, the radioligand may not recognize the guinea pig ileum muscle NK-1 receptors due to possible minor differences in their sequence or glycosylation.

With the growth of theranostics, nuclear medicine as a specialty is uniquely poised to grow along with the ever-increasing number of concepts combining imaging and therapy. This special report summarises the status and growth of Theranostic Nuclear Medicine in Singapore. We will cover our experience with the use of radioiodine, radioiodinated metaiodobenzylguanidine, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy, prostate specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy, radium-223 and yttrium-90 selective internal radiation therapy.

Xerostomia is a common side effect of RLT because of the high salivary gland uptake of PSMA radioligands. Here, we aimed to determine the impact of monosodium glutamate (MSG) administration on PSMA-radioligand biodistribution within healthy organs and tumor lesions by using Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET imaging. Methods: Sixteen men with prostate cancer were randomized (1:1) into oral ingestion and oral topical application ("swishing") arms. Each subject underwent 2 Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans within 14 d under baseline and MSG conditions. The salivary glands and whole-body tumor lesions were segmented using qPSMA software. We quantified tracer uptake via SUVmean and SUVmax and compared parameters within each patient. Results: For the oral ingestion arm, salivary gland SUVmean and SUVmax decreased on average from the control scan to the MSG scan by 45% +/- 15% (P = 0.004) and 53% +/- 11% (P < 0.001), respectively. Tumor lesion SUVmean and SUVmax also decreased by 38% (interquartile range, -67% to -33%) and -52% (interquartile range, -70% to -49%), respectively (P = 0.018). Swishing had no significant effect on Ga-68-PSMA-11 accumulation in normal organs or tumor lesions. Conclusion: Oral ingestion but not topical application of MSG reduced Ga-68-PSMA-11 uptake in salivary glands. Tumor uptake also declined; therefore, the clinical application of MSG is unlikely to be useful in the framework of RLT.

These studies are based on the assumption that DA exerts a competitive inhibition on radioligand binding. To test this, we used PET and a Scatchard approach to investigate whether the decrease in [C-11]raclopride binding following amphetamine results from competitive or noncompetitive interactions with DA. Methods. Scatchard analyses of [C-11]raclopride/PET data were used to quantify changes inapparent D-2-receptor density (Bmax) and radioligand apparent affinity (K-D')at baseline and after amphetamine pretreatment (2 mg/kg; intravenous) in cats. Results. Amphetamine induced a 46% decrease in [C-11]raclopride binding in the striatum of five cats, Scatchard analyses revealed that this decrease in binding was due to a 28016 decrease in Bmax and a concomitant 35% increase in K-D'. Conclusions: Competition with DA is an insufficient explanation for the decrease in [C-11]raclopride binding observed after amphetamine. Noncompetitive interactions, likely representing D-2-receptor internalization, also play an important role in this phenomenon. This finding may have important implications for the interpretation of amphetamine-raclopride PET studies in schizophrenia because dysregulation of the agonist-induced internalization of D-2 receptors was recently suggested in this disorder.

Lutetium Lu 177 Vipivotide Tetraxetan: First Approval	MOLECULAR DIAGNOSIS & THERAPY			English	Article							TRIAL	Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan (PLUVICTO (TM), formerly known as Lu-177-PSMA-617) is a radioligand therapeutic agent that is being developed by Advanced Accelerator Applications (a subsidiary of Novartis) for the treatment of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-expressing metastatic prostate cancer. The active part of the radiopharmaceutical is lutetium-177, which is linked to a ligand that binds to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a transmembrane enzyme overexpressed in primary and metastatic prostate cancers. Based on efficacy results from the phase 3 VISION trial, lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan was approved in the USA on 23 March 2022 for the treatment of adult patients with PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have been treated with androgen receptor (AR) pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy. Regulatory review in the EU and other countries is underway. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of Lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan leading to this first approval as a therapeutic radioligand for mCRPC.

The putative antidepressant activity of five of the binders with the highest SERT binding affinities was studied by the forced swim and locomotor activity mouse tests. The three-dimensional (3D) structures of 8 and 9 were determined using NOE NMR technique. Flexible docking of the compounds was undertaken to illustrate the binding of the compounds in the SERT model. Our results showed that several of the 6-NQ analogues are high-affinity SERT inhibitors and indicated that the octyl (8), decyl (10) and dodecyl (12) 6-NQ analogues exhibit moderate antidepressant activity.

To analyse the relationship between dopaminergic pathology and brain TSPO binding, PET studies of the dopamine transporter (DAT) were undertaken in PD patients using the DAT radioligand [F-18]FE-PE2I. The total distribution volume of [C-11]PBR28 was quantified in nigrostriatal regions, limbic cortices and thalamus, and the binding potential of [F-18]FE-PE2I was quantified in nigrostriatal regions.ResultsBased on genotype analysis of the TSPO rs6971 polymorphism, 16 subjects (8 control subjects and 8 PD patients) were identified as high-affinity binders, and the remaining subjects were identified as mixed-affinity binders. A two-way ANOVA showed a strong main effect of TSPO genotype on the cerebral binding of [C-11]PBR28, whereas no statistically significant main effect of diagnostic group, or a group by genotype interaction was found for any of the regions analysed. [F-18]FE-PE2I PET studies in patients indicated a marked reduction in nigrostriatal binding to DAT. However, no correlations between the binding parameters were found for [C-11]PBR28 and [F-18]FE-PE2I.ConclusionThe findings do not support the hypothesis of elevated cerebral TSPO binding or a relationship between TSPO binding and dopaminergic pathology in PD.

Unexpectedly high affinity of a novel histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist, GSK239512, <i>in vivo</i> in human brain, determined using PET	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						H-3 receptors; drug development; pharmacokinetics; receptor occupancy; PET study	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RELEASE; MODEL; PHARMACOKINETICS; PHARMACOLOGY; PERFORMANCE; INHIBITION; DISCOVERY	Background and PurposeThis study aimed to investigate the relationship between the plasma concentration (PK) of the novel histamine H-3 receptor antagonist, GSK239512, and the brain occupancy of H-3 receptors (RO) in healthy human volunteers. Experimental ApproachPET scans were obtained after i.v. administration of the H-3-specific radioligand [C-11]GSK189254. Each subject was scanned before and after single oral doses of GSK239512, at 4 and 24h after dose. PET data were analysed by compartmental analysis, and regional RO estimates were obtained by graphical analysis of changes in the total volumes of distribution of the radioligand, followed by a correction for occupancy by the high affinity radioligand. The PK/RO relationship was analysed by a population-modelling approach, using the average PK of GSK239512 during each scan. Key ResultsFollowing administration of GSK239512, there was a reduction in the brain uptake of [C-11]GSK189254 in all regions, including cerebellum. RO at 4h was higher than at 24h, and the PK/RO model estimated a PK associated with 50% of RO of 0.0068ngmL(-1). This corresponds to a free concentration of 4.50 x 10(-12)M (pK = 11.3). Conclusions and ImplicationsThe affinity of GSK239512 for brain H-3 receptors in humans in vivo is much higher than that expected from studies in vitro, and higher than that observed in PET studies in pigs. The study illustrates the utility of carrying out PET studies in humans early in drug development, providing accurate quantification of GSK239512 ROin vivo as a function of time and dose.

J	Milnes, JT; MacLeod, KT				Milnes, JT; MacLeod, KT			Reduced ryanodine receptor to dihydropyridine receptor ratio may underlie slowed contraction in a rabbit model of left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						cardiac hypertrophy; calcium; contractile function; E-C coupling; Ca channel; ryanodine receptor; dihydropyridine receptor; radioligand binding	SARCOPLASMIC-RETICULUM FUNCTION; GUINEA-PIG HEARTS; PRESSURE OVERLOAD; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; RELEASE CHANNEL; CALCIUM TRANSIENTS; CA2+ RELEASE; MYOCYTES; FAILURE; BINDING	Cardiac hypertrophy is associated with contractile dysfunction, a feature of which is a showing of the time to reach peal; contraction, We have examined the main mechanisms involved in the initiation of contraction and investigated if their functions are changed during cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by constriction of the ascending aorta in the rabbit, After 6 weeks left ventricular myocytes wore isolated or left ventricular and septal mixed membrane preparations were produced for electrophysiological and radioligand binding studies, respectively. Aortic constriction resulted in a 24%: and 23% increase in heart weight to body weight ratio and cell capacitance, respectively. Action potential duration and time-to-reach 50%, and 90% peak contraction (TTP50 and TTP90, respectively) were significantly prolonged in myocytes from hypertrophied hearts. The prolongation of TTP,,, and TTP,,, could not be explained by altered peak calcium current density or SR calcium content which were unchanged in hypertrophy. Radioligand binding studies performed on tissue preparations from the same hearts, revealed a 34% reduction in ryanodine receptor (RYR) density with no change in dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR) density, This resulted in a reduction in the ratio of RYR to DHPR from 4.1:1 to 3.3:1 in hypertrophy. Ryanodine receptor Ca2+-sensitivity was unchanged between sham operated and hypertrophied groups, A reduction in the ratio of RYRs to DHPRs may result in a degree of "functional uncoupling" causing defective release of Ca2+ from the SR. These findings may underlie the slowed TTP of myocyte contraction in hypertrophy. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

(Pyridinyl-6)-fluoro- and (pyridinyl-5)-fluoro-analogues of WAY-100635 (6-fluoro and 5-fluoro-WAY-100635, 5a/6a) were synthesized as well as the corresponding chloro-, bromo- and nitro-derivatives as precursors for labelling (5b-d and 6b-d). Comparative radiolabelling of these precursors with fluorine-18 (positron-emitting isotope, 109.8 min half-life) clearly demonstrated that only ortho-fluorination in this pyridine series, and not meta-fluorination, is of interest for the preparation of a radioligand by nucleophilic heteroaromatic substitution. 6-[F-18]Fluoro-WAY-100635 ([F-18]5a) can be efficiently synthesized in one step, either from the corresponding 6-bromo precursor (using conventional heating at 145degreesC for 10min) or from the corresponding 6-nitro precursor (using microwave activation at 100 W for 1 min). Typically, 15-25 mCi (0.55-0.92 GBq) of 6-[F-18]fluoro-WAY-100635 ([F-18]5a, 1-2Ci/mumol or 37-72GBq/mumol) were obtained in 50-70min starting from a 100mCi (3.7GBq) aliquot of a batch of cyclotron-produced [F-18]fluoride. This F-18-labelled radioligand is now being evaluated in PET studies. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sample Population-Synovial tissue obtained from 39 client-owned horses during arthroscopy and 14 research horses during necropsy; brain and synovial tissues were obtained during necropsy from 1 horse, and control tissues were obtained from a mouse. Procedure-Horses were classified into 7 groups on the basis of histologically determined degree of inflammation. Binding of primary rabbit antibody developed against mu -opioid receptors in equine synovial tissue was studied, using western blot analysis. Synovial membranes were tested for mu -opioid receptors by immunohistochemical staining, using a diaminobenzidine-cobalt chloride chromogen. Homogenates of synovial membranes were evaluated by use of radioligand binding. Results-Examination of western blots of equine thalamus revealed that rabbit antibody developed against mu -opioid receptors yielded a band (molecular weight, 55 kd) that corresponded with that of other opioid receptors. Use of immunohistochemical staining of synovial tissue revealed considerable staining in the proliferative lining layer and in regions surrounding vascular structures. Specific radioligand binding of tissue homogenates was found in all groups. We did not detect significant differences in binding between horses with inflammation and horses without inflammation. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results of immunohistochemical analysis and radioligand binding of tissue homogenates suggest that there are opioid receptors in synovial membranes of horses. Our results support the practice of intra-articular administration of opioids to relieve pain after arthroscopic surgery in horses.

Serotonergic neurons originate from the raphe nuclei in the brainstem, and reliable estimates of receptor/transporter availability in the raphe in vivo are thus of interest. Though positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to quantify receptor distribution in the brain, high noise levels prevent reliable estimation of radioligand binding in small regions such as the raphe. For this purpose, parametric imaging in combination with high-resolution PET systems may provide images with reduced noise levels and sufficient contrast for reliable quantification. This study examined the potential to evaluate radioligand binding in brainstem nuclei, and assessed the effect of improved resolution on the outcome measures. For comparative purposes, radioligand binding was measured with an ECAT EXACT HR PET system (resolution about 4.5 mm FWHM) and a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) system (resolution about 1.5 mm FWHM). Six subjects were examined with both systems on the same day using the serotonin transporter radioligand [C-11]MADAM. Parametric images of binding potential (BP (ND)) were obtained using a wavelet-aided approach. Regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated using a threshold-based semiautomatic delineation procedure for five brainstem structures. Regional BP (ND) values were estimated by applying the ROIs to the parametric images, and the percentage difference in BP (ND) between the systems was calculated. Signals for [C-11]MADAM binding were obtained for all five brainstem structures. Overall, the HRRT provided 30-40 % higher BP (ND) values than the HR (p = 0.0017), independent of thresholds used in the ROI delineation procedure. The methodology used enabled the estimation of [C-11]MADAM binding in the small nuclei of the brainstem. Differences in the BP (ND) values calculated using data from the two systems were mainly attributable to their differing resolutions. The estimated BP (ND) values provided lower across-subject variability than those previously obtained using compartment analysis. This procedure may therefore facilitate quantitative studies of receptor/transporter availability in the brainstem.

Radioligand Binding Assay for the Simultaneous Determination of β<sub>1</sub>- and β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenergic Receptors in Human Blood Cells	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors; radioligand binding assay; human cells	HUMAN T-LYMPHOCYTES; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; MONONUCLEAR-CELLS; EXPRESSION; ADRENOCEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGY; SELECTIVITY; SUBTYPES; LIGAND	In this study, we propose a method for the separate determination of both types of adrenergic receptors based on radioligand binding analysis using I-125-iodocyanopindolol, comprising three measurements: (1) without competing ligands, (2) in the presence of selective ligand ICI 118,551 (0.25 mu M), and (3) in the presence of two selective ligands, ICI 118,551 and CGP 20712 (0.25 mu M each). The technique was tested on a model system of two transgenic cell lines ADL-7A and A2R9 with the expression of recombinant beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. If the ratio of the number of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors to beta(2)-adrenergic receptors is 1 : 10, the measurement error is about 15%. Analysis of nine cell lines representing different types of blood cells showed the presence of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors in Daudi, Raji, Dami, K-562, HL-60, U-937, and THP-1 cells and their absence in Jurkat and MOLT-4 cells. beta(1)-Adrenergic receptors are reliably recorded only in THP-1 cells of monocytic origin. In other cell lines, with the exception of Dami, the number of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors was found below the detection limit, estimated as 250 molecules per cell. Measurements performed on the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of seven healthy donors showed the presence of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors in the range from 1000 to 2500 molecules per cell, while the content of beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in all cases appeared to be on the border or beyond the detection limit.

The characteristics of insulin binding to its receptors have been extensively studied by the radioligand binding assay. We used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to determine the distribution of diffusion times and further novel data on the kinetics of insulin's binding to its receptor. Methods. Cultured human renal tubular cells (HRTC) were incubated with tetramethyl rhodamine labelled insulin (Rh-Ins) for 60 min. Fluorescence intensity fluctuations and autocorrelation functions for Rh-Ins, free in the incubation medium and bound to the cell membrane, were studied at single-molecule detection sensitivity in a 0.2 fL confocal volume. Results. Measurements at the cell membrane revealed Rh-Ins binding with at least two diffusion components (diffusion times tau (D1) = 0.8 ms, tau (D2) = 20 ms) and corresponding weight fractions of y(1) = 0.43 and y(2) = 0.42. Specificity of the binding was shown by the dislocation of bound Rh-Ins when excess unlabelled insulin was added. Scatchard analysis showed a nonlinear plot, revealing two binding processes with different affinities (K-ass similar to 2 (.)10(10) M-1 and similar to 1 (.) 10(9) M-1, respectively). Conclusion/ interpretation. The fluorescence correlation spectroscopy results show two classes of binding sites with different affinities for insulin, or interactions between receptor sites consistent with negative cooperativity. This conclusion is in agreement with studies of insulin binding using radioligand binding assays. Because of its high sensitivity (single molecule detection), FCS, provides additional data allowing a more precise evaluation of the kinetics of ligand-receptor interactions at low expression levels in living cells.

The two receptor subtypes have specific drug actions, pharmacological profiles and molecular characteristics. The sigma(2) receptor is overexpressed in several tumor cell lines, and its ligands are currently under investigation for their role in tumor diagnosis and treatment. The sigma(2) receptor structure has not been disclosed, and researchers rely on sigma(2) receptor radioligand binding assay to understand the receptor's pharmacological behavior and design new lead compounds. Description: Here we present the sigma-2 Receptor Selective Ligands Database (S2RSLDB) a manually curated database of the sigma(2) receptor selective ligands containing more than 650 compounds. The database is built with chemical structure information, radioligand binding affinity data, computed physicochemical properties, and experimental radioligand binding procedures. The S2RSLDB is freely available online without account login and having a powerful search engine the user may build complex queries, sort tabulated results, generate color coded 2D and 3D graphs and download the data for additional screening. Conclusion: The collection here reported is extremely useful for the development of new ligands endowed of sigma(2) receptor affinity, selectivity, and appropriate physicochemical properties.

This retrospective study aimed to assess the activity and tolerability of Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT) in mCRPC patients across multiple cancer centers in Turkey. The study included 165 patients who received at least one cycle of Lu-177 PSMA-617 RLT, with the majority having bone metastases and undergone prior treatments. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were assessed before each treatment cycle, and the biochemical response was evaluated in accordance with the Prostate Cancer Work Group 3 Criteria. The PSA decline of >= 50% was classified as a response, while an increase of >= 25% in PSA levels was indicative of progressive disease. Neither response nor progression was considered as stable disease. The Lu-177 PSMA-617 RLT led to a significant PSA response, with 50.6% of patients achieving a >50% decrease in PSA levels. Median overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were 13.5 and 8.2 months, respectively. Patients receiving Lu-177 PSMA-617 RLT in combination with androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) had a higher OS compared to those receiving Lu-177 PSMA-617 RLT alone (18.2 vs 12.3 months, P = .265). The treatment was generally well-tolerated, with manageable side effects such as anemia and thrombocytopenia. This study provides real-world evidence supporting the effectiveness and safety of Lu-177 PSMA-617 RLT in mCRPC patients, particularly when used in combination with ARPIs. These findings contribute to the growing body of evidence on the potential benefits of PSMA-targeted therapies in advanced prostate cancer.

Moreover, it is used not only for the assessment of adequate PSMA expression of prostate cancer cells before PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy (RLT) but also for restaging during the course of therapy to evaluate response to treatment. Whereas no established criteria exist for systematic response evaluation so far, recently proposed PSMA PET Progression (PPP) criteria might fill this gap. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of PPP criteria in patients undergoing PSMA RLT and their prognostic implications. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, PSMA PET/CT scans of 46 patients before and after completion of PSMA RLT were analyzed separately by 2 readers using modified PPP criteria. After interobserver agreement assessment, consensus results (progressive vs. nonprogressive disease) were compared in a multivariate Cox regression model (endpoint, overall survival [OS]). Results: Interobserver agreement using the modified PPP criteria was substantial (Cohen kappa = 0.73), with a concordance in 87% of patients. The median OS of all patients after PSMA RLT (n -= 46) was 9.0 mo (95% CI, 7.8-10.2 mo). Progression according to the modified PPP criteria was found in 32 patients and was a significant (P <= 0.001) prognostic marker for OS, with a hazard ratio of 15.5 (95% CI, 3A-70.2). Conclusion: Response assessment in patients undergoing PSMA RLT using modified PPP criteria are reproducible and highly prognostic for OS. The modified PPP criteria should be validated in future prospective trials.

[C-11]AZD9272 is a selective mGluR5 PET radioligand that is structurally different from hitherto applied mGluR5 radioligands. In the present investigation we compared the binding patterns of radiolabeled AZD9272 and other mGluR5 radioligands in the non-human primate (NHP) brain. PET studies were undertaken using [C-11]AZD9272 and the commonly applied mGluR5 radioligand [C-11]ABP688. Autoradiography studies were performed in vitro using [H-3]AZD9272 and the standard mGluR5 radioligands [H-3]M-MTEP and [H-3]ABP688 in NHP tissue. Competition binding studies were undertaken in vivo and in vitro using different mGluR5 selective compounds as inhibitors. In comparison to other mGluR5 radioligands radiolabeled AZD9272 displayed a distinct regional distribution pattern with high binding in ventral striatum, midbrain, thalamus and cerebellum. While the binding of [C-11]AZD9272 was almost completely inhibited by the structurally unique mGIuR5 compound fenobam (2.0 mg/kg; 98% occupancy), it was only partially inhibited (46% and 20%, respectively) by the mGluR5 selective compounds ABP688 and MTEP, at a dose (2.0 mg/kg) expected to saturate the mGluR5. Autoradiography studies using [H-3]AZD9272 confirmed a distinct pharmacologic profile characterized by preferential sensitivity to fenobam. The distinctive binding in ventral striato-pallido-thalamic circuits and shared pharmacologic profile with the pro-psychotic compound fenobam warrants further examination of [C-11]AZD9272 for potential application in psychiatric neuroimaging studies.

Microglial activation in Parkinson's disease using [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-FEPPA	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; TSPO imaging; PET; Parkinson's disease	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PROTEIN 18 KDA; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; BINDING-AFFINITY; PET RADIOLIGAND; NEUROINFLAMMATION	Background: Neuroinflammatory processes including activated microglia have been reported to play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). Increased expression of translocator protein (TSPO) has been observed after brain injury and inflammation in neurodegenerative diseases. Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand targeting TSPO allows for the quantification of neuroinflammation in vivo. Methods: Based on the genotype of the rs6791 polymorphism in the TSPO gene, we included 25 mixed-affinity binders (MABs) (14 PD patients and 11 age-matched healthy controls (HC)) and 27 high-affinity binders (HABs) (16 PD patients and 11 age-matched HC) to assess regional differences in the second-generation radioligand [F-18]-FEPPA between PD patients and HC. FEPPA total distribution volume (V-T) values in cortical as well as subcortical brain regions were derived from a two-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma as an input function. Results: Our results revealed a significant main effect of genotype on [F-18]-FEPPA V-T in every brain region, but no main effect of disease or disease x genotype interaction in any brain region. The overall percentage difference of the mean FEPPA V-T between HC-MABs and HC-HABs was 32.6% (SD = 2.09) and for PD-MABs and PD-HABs was 43.1% (SD = 1.21). Conclusions: Future investigations are needed to determine the significance of [F-18]-FEPPA as a biomarker of neuroinflammation as well as the importance of the rs6971 polymorphism and its clinical consequence in PD.

Most published radioligand binding studies for sigma receptors utilize a low throughput method employing a "cell harvester." Higher throughput methods are required to facilitate efficient screening of large numbers of novel compounds. In this study, a series of reference compounds was analyzed with a new medium-throughput 96-well filtration method and the results were compared to those obtained using the conventional cell harvester-based method. The 96-well assay utilized rat liver membranes for the determination of both known if receptor subtypes (sigma(1) and sigma(2)) because this tissue contains high densities of both subtypes and fulfills criteria required for reliable use with the 96-well format. The new method gave comparable K-i values for reference ligands analyzed in parallel with samples prepared in rat brain membranes and processed on the traditional cell harvester. For sigma(1) receptors, equivalent affinity values were observed for both methods/tissues. For sigma(2) receptors, approximately 2-fold higher affinities were observed for most compounds in liver, as compared to brain membranes, but excellent correlation with brain-derived values was maintained. To further demonstrate the utility of the new method it was used to screen a novel series of 2(3H)-benzothiazolone compounds, resulting in the identification of several analogues with nanomolar affinity and greater than 50-fold specificity for sigma(1) versus sigma(2) receptors.

The resulting radioligand, [Tc-99m]Demotate, forms in a high purity and is stable for at least 6 h after labelling. The affinity of the unlabelled peptide for somatostatin receptors is high (IC50=0.13 nM) and comparable to that of [Tyr(3)]octreotate or [Tyr3]octreotide, as demonstrated by competition binding experiments in rat brain cortex or AR42J cell membrane preparations. An equally very high affinity (K-d=0.07 nM) was exhibited by [Tc-99m/Tc-99g]Demotate during saturation binding experiments using rat brain cortex membrane homogenates. The radioligand resisted hydrolytic degradation in mouse plasma and was excreted intact in mouse urine. In vivo, [Tc-99m]Demotate cleared very rapidly from non-target tissues into the bladder via the kidneys, while radioactivity uptake in target organs was very high. In mice bearing the experimental AR42J tumour, [99mTc]Demotate demonstrated a very high tumour uptake at I h p.i. (25%ID/g) that remained high (20%ID/g) at 4 h p.i. This uptake could be effectively blocked by co-injection of a high dose of [Tyr3]octreotate together with the radioligand. High-quality planar and single-photon emission tomographic images were acquired 1 h after injection of [Tc-99m]Demotate in tumour-bearing mice, illustrating the excellent properties of this agent for somatostatin receptor tumour imaging.

The binding studies were complemented by in vivo microdialysis to monitor 5-HT levels in similarly treated isoflurane-anaesthetised rats, with the dialysis probe locations corresponding to two of the tissues sampled for specific binding of the radioligand. Fenfluramine treatment (10 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in a similar to5-fold increase in extracellular 5-HT in medial prefrontal cortex and a similar to 15-fold increase in lateral hippocampus, maximal at similar to 40 min after injection. PET scan duration was either 60 or 90 min, beginning 30 min after fenfluramine injection. The specific binding of [C-11]WAY 100635 was reduced by 10-20% in hippocampus, which showed highest binding in control animals. Specific binding, however, was unaffected in both prefrontal cortex and midbrain raphe, each additional high binding regions. The minimal effects are consistent with a low baseline occupancy of the 5-HT1A receptor by 5-HT in vivo, so that only a large change in endogenous agonist concentration will affect radioligand binding. This implies that utilisation of [11C]WAY 100635 in human PET to quantify 5-HT1A receptor expression can be extended to pathology where synaptic 5-HT levels are altered as a consequence of the disease state.

The neuromodulator adenosine exerts anticonvulsant actions through binding adenosine receptors. Here, the impact of hyperthermia-induced seizures on adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors and 5'-nucleotidase activity has been studied at different periods in the cerebral cortical area by using radioligand binding, real-time PCR, and 5'-nucleotidase activity assays. Hyperthermic seizures were induced in 13-day-old rats using a warmed air stream from a hair dryer. Neonates exhibited rearing and falling over associated with hindlimb clonus seizures (stage 5 on Racine scale criteria) after hyperthermic induction. A significant increase in A(1) receptor density was observed using [H-3]DPCPX as radioligand, and mRNA coding A(1) was observed 48h after hyperthermia-induced seizures. In contrast, a significant decrease in A(2A) receptor density was detected, using [H-3]ZM241385 as radioligand, 48h after hyperthermia-evoked convulsions. These short-term changes in A(1) and A(2A) receptors were also accompanied by a loss of 5'-nucleotidase activity. No significant variations either in A(1) or A(2A) receptor density or 5'-nucleotidase were observed 5 and 20 days after hyperthermic seizures. Taken together, both regulation of A(1) and A(2A) receptors and loss of 5'-nucleotidase in the cerebral cortex suggest the existence of a neuroprotective mechanism against seizures.

However, quantification of receptor binding studies obtained with PET is complicated by tissue heterogeneity in the sampling image elements (i.e., voxels, pixels). This effect is caused by a limited spatial resolution of the PET scanner. Spatial heterogeneity is often essential in understanding the underlying receptor binding process. Tracer kinetic modeling also often requires an intrusive collection of arterial blood samples. In this paper, we propose a likelihood-based framework in the voxel domain for quantitative imaging with or without the blood sampling of the input function. Radioligand kinetic parameters are estimated together with the input function. The parameters are initialized by a subspace-based algorithm and further refined by an iterative likelihood-based estimation procedure. The performance of the proposed scheme is examined by simulations. The results show that the proposed scheme provides reliable estimation of factor time-activity curves (TACs) and the underlying parametric images. A good match is noted between the result of the proposed approach and that of the Logan plot. Real brain PET data are also examined, and good performance is observed in determining the TACs and the underlying factor images.

In this work, we developed a new tracer S-35-Proinsulin and it was employed in a combined radioligand binding assay with S-35-GAD for the simultaneous determination of GADA and PAA (RBA-combi). This novel assay was applied to sera from 85 young type 1 and 98 adult-onset diabetic patients, and to 53 normal control. Among type I diabetes sera, 100% of those with at least one positive marker by single methods, and 17.7% of those with double negative markers, were positive by RBA-combi (RBA-combi+). Among sera from adult-onset diabetes, 100% of those PAA+ (GADA+ or GADA-), 92.3% of GADA+/PAA-, and 1.3% of GADA-/PAA-, were RBA-combi+. Moreover, 88.9% of adult patients RBA-combi+ evolved to insulin requirement, suggesting a good predictive value for this method. In conclusion, the new tracer S-35- Proinsulin was able to be used in the RBA-combi allowing the simultaneous detection of GADA and PAA markers. Such marker combination is a valuable tool for assessing autoimmune processes associated to future insulin requirement in adult-onset diabetes.

High-resolution SPECT data were obtained with a pinhole collimator. In order to precisely estimate brain regions of low radioligand uptake, SPECT images were coregistered onto a MRI template with high accuracy (maximum mismatch 1.1 mm). To evaluate an adequate dose of radioligand to be administered without exceeding the radioligand-to-receptor occupancy >5% and to define an appropriate time period for image acquisition, three untreated groups of animals received 29.6, 37, and 44.4 MBq of [I-123]IBZM and underwent five consecutive SPECT acquisitions lasting 64 min each. Ratio calculations between specific striatal radioligand uptake and nondisplaceable cerebellar uptake revealed a secular equilibrium between 75 and 355 min post-tracer application in all three animal groups. Consequently, since the highest regional uptake values were obtained in the animal group receiving 44.4 MBq [I-123]IBZM, this injection dose was considered to be appropriate. Finally, the capacity of the imaging method to detect distinct severity levels of striatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor loss was tested in a low, medium, and high dose quinolinic acid (QA) animal model of Huntington's disease. Motor impairment indicative of striatal dysfunction was monitored using amphetamine-induced rotational behavior and locomotor activity. Loss of striatal D-2/D3R bearing medium-sized spiny neurons was assessed by DARPP-32 immunohistochemistry and compared to 112311 IBZM binding. Optical density measures of DARPP-32 immunohistochemistry demonstrated QA dose-dependent mild to subtotal unilateral striatal lesions ranging from 29.4% to 96.9% when compared to the nonlesioned side. Linear regression analysis showed that measurements of striatal DARPP-32 optical density and striatal 112311 IBZM uptake of the lesioned side were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.83; P < 0.001) whereas correlation with locomotor activity was less tight (r(2) = 0.23; P < 0.05; amphetamine-induced rotational behavior was not significantly correlated). This is the first study to demonstrate that in vivo [I-123]IBZM SPECT and MRI coregistration are highly sensitive and, in contrast to behavioral measures, accurately detect mild to subtotal striatal lesions by measuring loss of D-2/D3R availability. SPECT-MRI-based estimation of regional [I-123]IBZM uptake provides a cost effective and widely available in vivo imaging technique for assessing striatal integrity in animal studies.

Here, we conducted in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) and in vitro autoradiographic imaging of normal and TSPO-deficient mouse brains to compare the binding properties of F-18-FEBMP, a relatively novel TSPO radioligand developed for human studies based on its insensitivity to a common polymorphism, with C-11-PK11195, as well as other commonly used TSPO radioligands including C-11-PBR28, C-11-Ac5216 and F-18-FEDAA1106. TSPO in cerebral vessels of normal mice was found to provide a major binding site for C-11-PK11195, C-11-PBR28 and F-18-FEDAA1106, in contrast to no overt specific binding of F-18-FEBMP and C-11-Ac5216 to this vascular component. In addition, F-18-FEBMP yielded PET images of microglial TSPO with a higher contrast than C-11-PK11195 in a tau transgenic mouse modeling Alzheimer's disease (AD) and allied neurodegenerative tauopathies. Moreover, TSPO expression examined by immunoblotting was significantly increased in AD brains compared with healthy controls, and was well correlated with the autoradiographic binding of F-18-FEBMP but not C-11-PK11195. Our findings support the potential advantage of comparatively glial TSPO-selective radioligands such as F-18-FEBMP for PET imaging of inflammatory glial cells.

In vitro, on rat thalamus membranes [Br-76]BrPH bound to two sites with apparent affinities of 8 pM and 3 nM. The density of binding sites were 1.9 and 70 fmol/mg protein, respectively. In vivo, in biodistribution and autoradiographic studies in rats the regional distribution of [Br-76]BrPH paralleled the neuroanatomical localization of nAChRs. Two hours postinjection, the highest concentration in the brain was found in thalamus and colliculi (4% ID/g). Competition experiments with specific nicotinic, muscarinic, dopaminergic, and serotoninergic drugs confirmed that the in vivo binding of [Br-76]BrPH was consistent with neuronal nicotinic receptors. PET imaging of [Br-76]BrPH in baboon demonstrated a rapid and high uptake in the brain. Peak uptake occurred at 30-40 min for the thalamus. Due to the constant washout in the cerebellum, the thalamus to cerebellum ratio was 5 at 2 h postinjection. Subcutaneous injection of cytisine (1 mg/kg), 3 h postinjection of [Br-76]BrPH reduced the radioactivity concentration in thalamus and cortex by 58 and 50%, respectively, as observed 1 h later. Cytisine pretreatment (5 mg/kg s.c.) inhibited completely the radioligand accumulation in the thalamus. Chronic MPTP pretreatment resulted in reduction of [Br-76]BrPH uptake in all brain regions except in cerebellum. These preliminary results suggest that [Br-76]BrPH has the potential to be a useful radioligand for studying the pharmacology of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in preclinical experiments.

Binding of the novel radioligand [<SUP>3</SUP>H]UFP-101 to recombinant human and native rat nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptors	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nociceptin; Orphanin FQ; NOP receptor; Radiolabeled Nociceptin; Orphanin FQ receptor antagonist [H-3]UFP-101; Radioligand binding; Guanine nucleotides	MUSCARINIC CHOLINERGIC-RECEPTOR; DOG BRAIN MEMBRANES; HIGH-AFFINITY; ORPHANIN-FQ; ANTAGONIST; POTENT; PHARMACOLOGY; AGONIST; PEPTIDE; NUCLEOTIDES	Nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) is the endogenous ligand for the N/OFQ peptide receptor (NOP). Binding studies have relied on [leucyl-H-3]N/OFQ, but as this is an agonist G-protein coupling will affect affinity. In this paper, we describe a new [H-3]labeled NOP antagonist, [Nphe(1), 4'-H-3-Phe(4),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH2 ([H-3]UFP-101). We have characterized [H-3]UFP-101 at recombinant human NOP expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHOhNOP) and native rat NOP in cerebrocortex. Radioligand saturation and competition studies were performed on membranes, and [H-3]UFP-101 (antagonist) was compared with [H-3]N/OFQ (agonist). The effects of GTP gamma S (10 mu M) and Na+ were investigated alone and in combination in competition experiments with both radioligands. In CHOhNOP, B (max), and pK (D), values were 561 and 580 fmol mg protein(-1) and 9.97 and 10.19 for [H-3]UFP-101 and [leucyl-H-3]N/OFQ, respectively. In rat cerebrocortex B (max) and pK (D), values were 65 and 88 fmol mg protein(-1) and 10.12 and 10.34 for [H-3]UFP-101 and [leucyl-H-3]N/OFQ. The binding of both radioligands was displaced by a range of peptide and non-peptide NOP ligands at both isoforms with good correlation (r(2) 0.92 in Rat and 0.97 in CHOhNOP). Naloxone was inactive. The binding of both radioligands was Na+ dependent with [H-3]UFP-101 being more sensitive (IC50 similar to 20 mM). Unlike the agonist [leucyl-H-3]N/OFQ, the antagonist [H-3]UFP-101 was unaffected by GTP gamma S. [H-3]UFP-101 binds to human and rat NOP with high affinity and good agreement with standard [leucyl-H-3]N/OFQ in competition experiments. In addition, the binding of [H-3]UFP-101 is unaffected by GTP gamma S. This radioligand will be useful to further characterize NOP in a range of binding paradigms.

In this study, uPAR PET imaging using a Ga-68-labeled version of the uPAR-targeting peptide (AE105) was investigated in a group of patients with BC, PC, and UBC. The aim of this first-in-human, phase I clinical trial was to investigate the safety and biodistribution in normal tissues and uptake in tumor lesions. Methods: Ten patients (6 PC, 2 BC, and 2 UBC) received a single intravenous dose of Ga-68-NOTA-AE105 (154 +/- 59 MBq; range, 48-208 MBq). The biodistribution and radiation dosimetry were assessed by serial whole-body PET/CT scans (10 min, 1 h, and 2 h after injection). Safety assessment included measurements of vital signs with regular intervals during the imaging sessions and laboratory blood screening tests performed before and after injection. In a subgroup of patients, the in vivo stability of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105 was determined in collected blood and urine. PET images were visually analyzed for visible tumor uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-AE105, and SUVs were obtained from tumor lesions by manually drawing volumes of interest in the malignant tissue. Results: No adverse events or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects were found. The radioligand exhibited good in vivo stability and fast clearance from tissue compartments primarily by renal excretion. The effective dose was 0.015 mSv/MBq, leading to a radiation burden of 3 mSv when the clinical target dose of 200 MBq was used. In addition, radioligand accumulation was seen in primary tumor lesions as well as in metastases. Conclusion: This first-in-human, phase I clinical trial demonstrates the safe use and clinical potential of Ga-68-NOTA- AE105 as a new radioligand for uPAR PET imaging in cancer patients.

Radiosynthesis and In Vivo Evaluation of Novel Radioligands for PET Imaging of Cerebral 5-HT<sub>7</sub> Receptors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						C-11-Cimbi-717; C-11-Cimbi-712; 5-HT7 receptor; PET; novel radioligand	ANTAGONIST; DEPRESSION; SB-269970; BLOCKADE; KNOCKOUT; BEHAVIOR; BINDING; CLONING; LIGAND; BRAIN	The serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) 7 receptor (5-HT7R) is the most recently discovered 5-HT receptor, and its physiologic and possible pathophysiologic roles are not fully elucidated. So far, no suitable 5-HT7R PET radioligand is available, thus limiting the investigation of this receptor in the living brain. Here, we present the radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of Cimbi-712 (3-{4-[4-(4-methylphenyl)piperazine-1-yl]butyl}p-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one) and Cimbi-717 (3-{4-[4-(3-methoxyphenyl)piperazine-1-yl]butyl}-1,3-dihydro-2H-indol-2-one) as selective 5-HT7R PET radioligands in the pig brain. The 5-HT7R distribution in the postmortem pig brain is also assessed. Methods: In vitro autoradiography with the 5-HT7R selective radioligand 3H-labeled (R)-3-(2-(2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl) ethyl) pyrrolidine-1-sulfonyl) phenol (SB-269970) was performed on pig brain sections to establish the 5-HT7R binding distribution. Radio-labeling of 5-HT7R selective compounds was performed in an automated synthesis module in which we conducted either palladium-mediated cross coupling (C-11-Cimbi-712) or conventional O-methylation (C-11-Cimbi-717) using C-11-MeI and C-11-MeOTf, respectively. After intravenous injection of the radioligands in Danish Landrace pigs, the in vivo brain distribution of the ligands was studied. Specific binding of C-11-Cimbi-712 and C-11-Cimbi-717 to 5-HT7R was investigated by intravenous administration of SB-269970 before a second PET scan. Results: High 5-HT7R density was found in the thalamus and cortical regions of the pig brain by autoradiography. The radio-synthesis of both radioligands succeeded after optimization efforts (radiochemical yield, similar to 20%-30% at the end of synthesis). Time-activity curves of C-11-Cimbi-712 and C-11-Cimbi-717 showed high brain uptake and distribution according to 5-HT7R distribution, but the tracer kinetics of C-11-Cimbi-717 were faster than C-11-Cimbi-712. Both radioligands were specific for 5-HT7R, as binding could be blocked by pretreatment with SB-269970 for C-11-Cimbi-717 in a dose-dependent fashion. For C-11-Cimbi-717, nondisplaceable binding potentials of 6.4 +/- 1.2 (n = 6) were calculated in the thalamus. Conclusion: Both C-11-Cimbi-712 and C-11-Cimbi-717 generated a specific binding in accordance with 5-HT7R distribution and are potential PET radioligands for 5-HT7R. C-11-Cimbi-717 is the better candidate because of the more reversible tracer kinetics, and this radioligand showed a dose-dependent decline in cerebral binding after receptor blockade. Thus, C-11-Cimbi-717 is currently the most promising radioligand for investigation of 5-HT7R binding in the living human brain.

Measuring specific receptor binding of a PET radioligand in human brain without pharmacological blockade: The genomic plot	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Non-displaceable binding; PET; Lassen plot; Allen brain atlas; Pharmacological displacement; Pharmacological blockade; mRNA	KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTOR; PEPTIDE NOP RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; ANTAGONIST RADIOTRACER; REFERENCE REGION; QUANTIFICATION; MODEL; PHOSPHODIESTERASE-4; C-11-LY2795050; EXPRESSION	PET studies allow in vivo imaging of the density of brain receptor species. The PET signal, however, is the sum of the fraction of radioligand that is specifically bound to the target receptor and the non-displaceable fraction (i.e. the non-specifically bound radioligand plus the free ligand in tissue). Therefore, measuring the non-displaceable fraction, which is generally assumed to be constant across the brain, is a necessary step to obtain regional estimates of the specific fractions. The nondisplaceable binding can be directly measured if a reference region, i.e. a region devoid of any specific binding, is available. Many receptors are however widely expressed across the brain, and a true reference region is rarely available. In these cases, the nonspecific binding can be obtained after competitive pharmacological blockade, which is often contraindicated in humans. In this work we introduce the genomic plot for estimating the nondisplaceable fraction using baseline scans only. The genomic plot is a transformation of the Lassen graphical method in which the brain maps of mRNA transcripts of the target receptor obtained from the Allen brain atlas are used as a surrogate measure of the specific binding. Thus, the genomic plot allows the calculation of the specific and nondisplaceable components of radioligand uptake without the need of pharmacological blockade. We first assessed the statistical properties of the method with computer simulations. Then we sought ground-truth validation using human PET datasets of seven different neuroreceptor radioligands, where nonspecific fractions were either obtained separately using drug displacement or available from a true reference region. The population nondisplaceable fractions estimated by the genomic plot were very close to those measured by actual human blocking studies (mean relative difference between 2% and 7%). However, these estimates were valid only when mRNA expressions were predictive of protein levels (i.e. there were no significant posttranscriptional changes). This condition can be readily established a priori by assessing the correlation between PET and mRNA expression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They play an important role in several disease processes, such as inflammation, cancer, and atherosclerosis. Methods and Results - In this study, we have used the broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor CGS 27023A to develop the radioligand [I-123] I-HO-CGS 27023A for in vivo imaging of MMP activity. Using this radioligand, we were able to specifically image MMP activity by scintigraphy in vivo in the MMP-rich vascular lesions that develop after carotid artery ligation and cholesterol-rich diet in apolipoprotein E - deficient mice. These results were confirmed by gamma counting of lesional tissue ( counts per minute per milligram). Conclusions - Imaging of MMP activity in vivo is feasible using radiolabeled MMP inhibitors. Additional studies are needed to test the potential of this approach as a novel noninvasive clinical diagnostic tool for the management of human MMP-related diseases.

The need for a high throughput rate in screening drugs Is actually leading to simplified experimental schemes that increase the probability of false negative results. Special concern involves voltage-gated ion channel drug discovery where a great care is required in designing assays because of frequent multiplicity of (interacting] binding sites. To clearly illustrate this situation, three different assays used in the academic drug discovery program of the authors were selected because they are rich of intrinsic artifacts: II) (20 mmol/l caffeine almost duplicated [H-3]ryanodine binding (89% higher than control) to rat heart microsomes at 0.3 mu mol/l free calcium but did not exert any effect when using a high (107 mu mol/l) free calcium, as mostly used in ryanodine binding assays; [II) Rn agonist for the ionotropic glutamate receptor of the kainate type can distinctly affect [H-3]kainate binding to chicken cerebellum membranes depending on its concentration: unlabelled kainic acid per se either stimulated about 30% (at 50-100 nmol/l), had no effect (at 200 nmol/l) or even progressively decreased [at 0.3-2 mu mol/l) the binding of 5 nmol/l [H-3]kainate, emphasizing the risk of using a single concentration for screening a drug; (III) In a classical [3H]flunitrazepam binding assay, the stimulatory effect of a GABA (gamma -aminobutyric acid) agonist was only observed when using extensively washed rat brain synaptosomes (10 mu mol/l GABA increased flunitrazepam binding by 90%). On the other hand, the Inhibitory effect of a GABA antagonist was only observed when using crude synaptosomes (10 mu mol/l bicuculine reduced [3H]flunitrazepam binding by 40%). It can be concluded that carefully designed radioligand assays which can be performed in an academic laboratory are appropriate for screening a small number of drugs, especially if these are potential hits because of their rational design. Therefore, the low throughput rate could be partially balanced by a higher performance when compared to what is done in a robotic high throughput screening where simplification of assay conditions can lead to False negative results.

Rotenoids and Other Specialized Metabolites from the Roots of <i>Mirabilis multiflora</i>: Opioid and Cannabinoid Receptor Radioligand Binding Affinities	JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS			English	Article							BOERHAAVIA-DIFFUSA L; ABSOLUTE-CONFIGURATION; CIRCULAR-DICHROISM; CONSTITUENTS; PLANTS	Mirabilis multiflora is an acclaimed hallucinogen consumed traditionally by the Hopi Indians to induce diagnostic visions. Its root extract afforded a new (3) and four known (2, 5, 6, and 7) 12a-hydroxyrotenoids, a known rotenoid (4), and two known secondary metabolites (1 and 8). The structures of the compounds were elucidated based on spectroscopic and spectrometric data analysis. Electronic circular dichroism data were used to define the (6aS,12aR) absolute configuration of the 12a-hydroxyrotenoids. Compounds 2-7 were screened for their radioligand binding affinities toward the opioid (delta, kappa, and mu) and cannabinoid (CB1 and CB2) receptor subtypes. The 6-methoxy-substituted rotenoids 3, 4, and 7 showed the highest receptor binding affinity with moderate selectivity toward the delta-opioid receptor subtype, with negligible binding affinities for CB1 and CB2. Their binding affinities toward the delta-opioid receptor were 64.5% (4), 58.7% (7), and 55.3% (3) at 10 mu M, respectively.

Novel molecular imaging ligands targeting matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9 for imaging of unstable atherosclerotic plaques	PLOS ONE			English	Article							IN-VITRO; INHIBITORS; POTENT; LYMPHOCYTES; DEFICIENT; RUPTURE; DISEASE	Molecular imaging of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) may allow detection of atherosclerotic lesions vulnerable to rupture. In this study, we develop a novel radiolabelled compound that can target gelatinase MMP subtypes (MMP2/9) with high selectivity and inhibitory potency. Inhibitory potencies of several halogenated analogues of MMP subtype-selective inhibitors (N-benzenesulfonyliminodiacetyl monohydroxamates and N-halophenoxy-benzenesulfonyl iminodiacetyl monohydroxamates) were in the nanomolar range for MMP2/9. The analogue with highest inhibitory potency and selectivity was radiolabelled with [I-123], resulting in moderate radiochemical yield, and high radiochemical purity. Biodistribution studies in mice, revealed stabilization in blood 1 hour after intravenous bolus injection. Intravenous infusion of the radioligand and subsequent autoradiography of excised aortas showed tracer uptake in atheroprone mice. Distribution of the radioligand showed co-localization with MMP2/9 immunohistochemical staining. In conclusion, we have developed a novel selective radiolabeled MMP2/9 inhibitor, suitable for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging that effectively targets atherosclerotic lesions in mice.

Although these receptors were generally believed to be monomeric entities, accumulating evidence supports the presence of GPCRs in multimeric forms. Here, using immunoprecipitation as well as time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer to assess protein-protein interactions in living cells, we unambiguously demonstrate the occurrence of dimerization of the human histamine H-1 receptor. We also show the presence of domain-swapped H-1 receptor dimers in which there is the reciprocal exchange of transmembrane domain TM domains 6 and 7 between the receptors present in the dimer. Mutation of aspartate(107) in transmembrane (TM) 3 or phenylalanine(432) in TM6 to alanine results in two radioligand-binding-deficient mutant H-1 receptors. Coexpression of H-1 D(107)A and H-1 F(432)A, however, results in a reconstituted radioligand binding site that exhibits a pharmacological profile that corresponds to the wildtype H-1 receptor. Interestingly, the H-1 receptor radioligands [H-3] mepyramine and [H-3]-(-)- trans-1-phenyl-3-N, N-dimethylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene show differential saturation binding values (B-max) for wild-type H-1 receptors but not for the radioligand binding site that is formed upon coexpression of H-1 D(107)A and H-1 F(432)A receptors, suggesting the presence of different H-1 receptor populations.

An efficient and information-rich biochemical method design for fragment library screening on ion channels	BIOTECHNIQUES			English	Article						fragment; library; 5-HT3; cys-loop; ligand; high-throughput; screen; therapeutic	DRUG DISCOVERY; RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGY; GABA(A); INHIBITORS; LIGANDS; 5-HT3	Drug discovery requires a simple, rapid, and cost-effective method for the early identification of novel leads and elimination of poor candidates. Here we present an experimental design that fulfils these criteria, using a ligand-gated ion channel expressed in a mammalian cell line, whose function can be probed using a voltage-sensitive dye. The experimental design is novel, as it uses the same screen to identify hit fragments and to characterize them as agonists or antagonists. The results were independently validated using radioligand binding, although the new technique has several advantages over radioligand methods. A number of novel high-affinity ligands were found. The method is broadly applicable to a wide range of receptor types including ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs), voltage-gated ion channels (VGICs), and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), all of which are important drug targets.

These recombinant cell lines have been employed in radioligand binding assays to determine the equilibrium inhibitor constants of known prostanoid receptor ligands at these eight receptors. This has allowed, for the first time, an assessment of the affinity and selectivity of several novel compounds at the individual human prostanoid receptors. This information should facilitate interpretation of pharmacological studies that employ these ligands as tools to study human tissues and cell lines and should, therefore, result in a greater understanding of prostanoid receptor biology.

PET imaging of dopamine D-2 receptor, dopamine transporter, serotonin(1A) receptor and sigma(1) receptor in the eyes and brain was performed using corresponding positron-emitting ligands in baseline, pretreatment and displacement conditions. The 4 radioligands outlined the eyes and brain in the baseline. Pretreatment resulted in a slight reduction (26-28%) in the uptake in the anterior segments of eyes. The binding of each radioligand in the iris-ciliary body and retina was confirmed by ex vivo autoradiography. However, the PET signal in the eyes was unexpectedly higher than the autoradiography signal. The identification of radioligand-neuroreceptor binding by PET in the rabbit eyes is not specific enough.

AFM was prepared from 4-chloro-3-nitrobenzyl acetate and thiosalicylic acid in a five-step synthetic sequence. In binding studies in vitro with cloned human transporters, AFM displayed high binding affinity (Ki 1.04 nmol/L for hSERT) and good selectivity (Ki 664 nmol/L for hNET and >10,000 nmol/L for hDAT) for SERT. The radiolabled compound [C-11]AFM was prepared in 30-37 minutes from its monomethylamine precursor by reaction with high specific activity [C-11]iodomethane. Radiochemical yield was 12.3 +/- 8.1% based on [C-11]iodomethane and specific activity was 1733 +/- 428 Ci/mmol at end of synthesis (EOS, n = 14). Radiochemical and chemical purity of the final product was >97%. Biodistribution studies in rats indicated that [C-11]AFM entered the brain readily and localized in regions known to contain high concentrations of SERT, with high specific to nonspecific binding ratios. Furthermore, binding of [C-11]AFM in SERT-rich regions was blocked by the cold compound AFM and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram but not by the selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor nisoxetine or the selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor GBR 12935. At 30 minutes after injection, >95% of the brain activity corresponded to the parent compound, indicating the absence of radiolabeled metabolites in the rat brain. PET imaging experiments in baboons showed a brain distribution pattern of [C-11]AFM consistent with the regional concentrations of SERT, with the highest levels of radioactivity detected in the midbrain and thalamus, moderate levels in the hippocampus and striatum, and the low levels in the cortical regions. Pretreatment of the baboons with citalopram (4 and 6 mg/kg, intravenously) reduced regional brain distribution volumes to low and homogeneous levels, thus underlining the binding specificity of [C-11]AFM for SERT in vivo. Analysis of blood samples indicated a fast metabolism of the radioligand into more hydrophilic components, as well as the absence of radiolabeled lipophilic metabolites. Regional time-activity curves were analyzed with kinetic and graphical analysis methods using the arterial concentrations as input function. Both methods returned similar kinetic parameters and documented high specific to nonspecific equilibrium coefficients (V-3") for [C-11]AFM. Identical V-3" values were also derived with the simple reference tissue method, indicating that quantification of SERT with [C-11]AFM can be achieved without arterial blood sampling. In summary, [C-11]AFM appears to be an excellent PET radioligand for the visualization and reliable quantification of SERT in vivo. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

They represent a relevant target for the diagnosis and internal targeted radiotherapy of these tumors. Although previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of radiolabeled CCK/gastrin to target CCK-2 receptor-expressing tissues in animals and patients, some problems remained unsolved to identify an optimum candidate for in vivo targeting of R-CCK2-expressing tumors. By a rational approach and "in silico" drug design, we synthesized a new CCK-derivative with high affinity for the R-CCK2. The aim of this study was to achieve the radiolabeling of a new radioligand, to assess its efficacy using a published CCK radioligand (In-111-DTPA-CCK8) as a control for the R-CCK2 targeting. This new CCK-derivative was radiolabeled with In-111. Nude mice, bearing the human MTC TT tumors and NIH-3T3 cell line expressing a tumorigenic mutant of the R-CCK2, were injected with this radiolabeled peptide. In vivo planar scintigraphies were acquired. Thereafter, biodistribution studies (%ID/g tissue) were done. The conditions of radiolabelling were optimized to obtain a radiochemical purity > 90%. Scintigraphic images of xenograft mice showed significant tumor uptake with a target to nontarget ratio higher than two. These results were confirmed by the biodistribution studies which showed as expected a significant activity in the spleen, the liver and the kidneys. Therefore, this new radiolabeled compound is a promised new candidate for molecular imaging and internal radiotherapy for R-CCK2 tumor targeting. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The purpose of this study was to compare genetic association studies of three polymorphisms of the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor gene (ADRA2A) with radioligand binding studies of the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor protein in platelets from a sample of children without or with ADHD. The pediatric subjects ranged from 6 to 18 years of age. A thorough clinical assessment of each child resulted in one of the following DSM-IV ADHD diagnoses: inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, combined, or no ADHD. No significant linkage was found between the ADRA2A polymorphisms (MspI, HhaI, and DraI) and any of the phenotypes tested. Association analysis, however, did detect significant linkage disequilibrium for the DraI polymorphism. Association was also evaluated considering the three ADRA2A single nucleotide polymorphisms as haplotypes. The HhaI-DraI and the Mspi-HhaI-DraI haplotypes were significantly associated with ADHD. The platelet alpha-2 adrenergic receptor density did not differ between children without or with ADHD. The affinity of the receptor for the radioligand however, differed significantly between those without and with ADHD. In addition, there were some significant correlations between binding parameters and severity of ADHD in this well-characterized clinical population, and significant association was found between these measures of receptor function and MspI and DraI polymorphisms. Thus, both the genetic and the binding studies indicate that the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor may play a role in ADHD. (c) 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A., Edwards, P. D., Scott, C. W., and Greenberg, B. D. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 31499-31505). This unusual kinetics suggests physical separation of the sites for substrate binding and catalysis with binding of the transition state analogs to the catalytic site and not to the substrate binding site. Methods of inhibitor cross-competition kinetics and competition ligand binding were utilized to address whether nontransition state small molecule inhibitors, which also display non-competitive inhibition of gamma-secretase, inhibit the enzyme by binding to the catalytic site as well. Inhibitor cross-competition kinetics indicated competitive binding between the transition state analogs PME and L685458 and between small molecules arylsulfonamides and benzodiazepines, but non-competitive binding between the transition state analogs and the small molecule inhibitors. These results were indicative of two inhibitor binding sites, one for transition state analogs and the other for non-transition state small molecule inhibitors. The presence of two inhibitor binding sites for two different classes of inhibitors was corroborated by results from competition ligand binding using [H-3]L685458 as the radioligand. Although L685458 and PME displaced the radioligand at the same concentrations as for enzyme inhibition, arylsulfonamides and benzodiazepines did not displace the radioligand at their K-i values, a result consistent with the presence of two inhibitor binding sites. These findings provide useful insights into the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of gamma-secretase that may facilitate the design of novel gamma-secretase inhibitors.

J	Melena, J; Stanton, D; Osborne, NN				Melena, J; Stanton, D; Osborne, NN			Comparative effects of antiglaucoma drugs on voltage-dependent calcium channels	GRAEFES ARCHIVE FOR CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPHTHALMOLOGY			English	Article							RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; OPTIC-NERVE HEAD; CORNEAL EPITHELIAL-CELLS; OCULAR BLOOD-FLOW; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; CA2+ CHANNELS; TOPICAL BETAXOLOL; BETA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONIST; AMINOGLYCOSIDE ANTIBIOTICS; BENZALKONIUM CHLORIDE	Background: Experimental evidence suggests that substances able to interact with voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) might be beneficial in glaucoma management. It was therefore of significance to show that beta -adrenoceptor antagonists used in glaucoma directly interact with L-type VDCCs. In the present study, the affinity of several antiglaucoma drugs (betaxolol, carteolol, levobunolol, timolol, brimonidine, dorzolamide, latanoprost and pilocarpine) for these and other VDCCs was investigated using radioligand binding assays. Experiments were also carried Out to assess the effect of antiglaucoma drugs on the NMDA-stimulated Ca2+ influx into isolated rat retinas. Methods: Competition radioligand binding studies to L-, N- and P/Q-type VDCCs were performed in rat cortical homogenates. The effects of antiglaucoma drugs on the NMDA-stimulated influx of Ca-45(2+) were studied in isolated rat retinas. Results: Only beta -adrenoceptor antagonists significantly interacted with radioligand binding to L-type VDCCs, with betaxolol displaying the highest potency. None of the antiglaucoma drugs tested showed any significant affinity for either N- or P/Q-type VDCCs. Only P-adrenoceptor antagonists attenuated the NMDA-stimulated Ca-45(2+) influx into isolated rat retinas, with betaxolol exhibiting at least 10 times higher potency than timolol. Brimonidine, dorzolamide, latanoprost and pilocarpine did not elicit any significant effect on the NMDA-stimulated Ca-45(2+) influx. Additional experiments strongly suggested that the effect of betaxolol on the NMDA-stimulated Ca-45(2+) resulted from inhibition of L-type VDCCs. Conclusion: Of the antiglaucoma drugs investigated, betaxolol displays the greatest L-type VDCC-blocking activity and this may be of clinical relevance. Such a characteristic could account for some of its described ocular actions.

One thousand samples from the staff of a general hospital providing treatment to patients with severe COVID-19 were assayed for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (N) IgG using RLA. Nine patients with COVID-19 who had been treated in inpatient settings and had already recovered were used as control subjects, and 186 blood donor samples obtained more than 10 years ago were used as negative controls. Four of the 1000 samples showed apparently positive results, and approximately 10 or more samples showed slightly high counts. Interestingly, a few among the blood donor samples also showed slightly high values. To validate the results, antibody examinations using ELISA and neutralizing antibody tests were performed on 21 samples, and chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) was performed on 201 samples, both resulting in a very high correlation. One blood donor sample showed slightly positive results in both RLA and CLIA, suggesting a cross-reaction. This study showed that five months after the pandemic began in Japan, the staff of a general hospital with a tertiary emergency medical facility had an extremely low seroprevalence of the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Further investigation will be needed to determine whether the slightly high results were due to cross-reactions or a low titer of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. The quantitative RLA was considered sensitive enough to detect low titers of antibodies.

Design, physico-chemical and pre-clinical evaluation of a homo-bivalent <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-(BTZ)<sub>2</sub>DTPA radioligand for targeting dimeric 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>/5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors	NEW JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO; SEROTONIN 5-HT1A; OPIOID AGONIST; HUMAN-BRAIN; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; LIGAND APPROACH; BINDING; ANTAGONIST; DERIVATIVES	A mixed affinity dimeric radioligand Tc-99m-(BTZ)(2)DTPA was designed using a bivalent ligand approach and evaluated as an SPECT imaging agent for targeting 5-HT1A/5-HT7 dimeric receptors in the central nervous system. In silico studies reflected high affinity for dimeric 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptors. Following multi-step synthesis, the ligand was obtained in 87.5% yield. Detailed physico-chemical analysis included pK(a) evaluation and optimization of radiolabeling parameters (>98% radiolabeling efficiency). The in vitro serum-stability test of the Tc-99m-complex showed 8.7% dissociation and appreciable stability when challenged with excess cysteine (4.4% dissociation). Cyto-compatibility (4.8-0.6% cell death at 100 M to 1 pM) and haemo-compatibility (1.05% erythrocyte destruction) suggested optimum biocompatibility. Blood kinetics revealed biphasic clearance. The brain/blood ratio of 0.66 assured the CNS penetration ability and BBB permeability of the developed radioligand. Bio-distribution and in vivo SPECT imaging revealed a maximum brain uptake of 2.08 +/- 0.08% ID per g at 10 min p.i. followed by major activity accumulation in 5-HT1A/5-HT7 receptor-rich regions viz., the hippocampus (41.83% ID per g) and the cortex (23.56% ID per g) of mouse brains ascertaining selective targeting of Tc-99m-(BTZ)(2)DTPA. The radiotracer was excreted majorly through the renal route. These preclinical studies reveal that the Tc-99m-(BTZ)(2)DTPA radiotracer shows promise as an effective diagnostic agent for neurological disorders.

Receptor localization, native tissue binding and <i>ex vivo</i> occupancy for centrally penetrant P2X7 antagonists in the rat	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X7 receptor; rat cortex; radioligand binding; occupancy	P2X(7) RECEPTOR; PURINERGIC RECEPTORS; MICROGLIAL CELLS; EXPRESSION; INHIBITION; RELEASE; TERMINALS; CLONING	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The P2X7 receptor is implicated in inflammation and pain and is therefore a potential target for therapeutic intervention. Here, the development of a native tissue radioligand binding, localization and ex vivo occupancy assay for centrally penetrant P2X7 receptor antagonists is described. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Autoradiography studies using the P2X7 antagonist radioligand [3H]-A-804598 were carried out in rat brain and spinal cord. Subsequent in vitro binding and ex vivo occupancy assays were performed using rat cortex homogenate. KEY RESULTS P2X7 expression was shown to be widespread throughout the rat brain, and in the grey matter of the spinal cord. In binding assays in rat cortex homogenate, similar to 60% specific binding was achieved at equilibrium. In kinetic binding assays, k(on) and k(off) values of 0.0021 center dot min-1 center dot nM-1 and 0.0070 center dot min-1 were determined, and the K-d derived from kinetic measurements was consistent with that derived from saturation analysis. Novel P2X7 antagonists inhibited the binding of [3H]-A-804598 to rat cortex P2X7 receptors with K-i values of < 40 nM. In an ex vivo occupancy assay, a P2X7 antagonist dosed orally to rats caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of the specific binding of [3H]-A-804598 to rat cortex. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The present study describes the development of an assay that allows localization of P2X7 receptors, the measurement of the binding affinity of P2X7 receptor antagonists in native tissue, and provides a means of determining central P2X7 receptor occupancy. These assays could form an important part of a P2X7 drug discovery programme.	[Able, S.

A consistent and efficient graphical analysis method to improve the quantification of reversible tracer binding in radioligand receptor dynamic PET studies	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LIVING HUMAN-BRAIN; DOPAMINE-RECEPTORS; TRANSFER CONSTANTS; BLOOD; MODEL; NEURORECEPTORS; VALIDATION; REGRESSION; TRANSPORT	The widely used Logan plot in radioligand receptor dynamic PET studies produces marked noise-induced negative biases in the estimates of total distribution volume (DVT) and binding potential (BP). To avoid the inconsistencies in the estimates from the Logan plot, a new graphical analysis method was proposed and characterized in this study. The new plot with plasma input and with reference tissue input was first derived to estimate DVT and BP. A condition was provided to ensure that the estimate from the new plot equals DVT or BP. It was demonstrated theoretically that 1) the statistical expectations of the estimates from the new plot with given input are independent of the noise of the target tissue concentration measured by PET; and 2) the estimates from the time activity curves of regions of interest are identical to those from the parametric images for the new plot. The theoretical results of the new plot were also confirmed by computer simulations and fifty-five human [C-11]raclopride dynamic PET studies. By contrast, the marked noise-induced underestimation in the DVT and BP images and noise-induced negative bias in the estimates from the Logan plot were demonstrated by the same data sets used for the new plot. The computational time for generating DVT or BP images in the human studies was reduced by 80% on average by the new plot in contrast to the Logan plot. In conclusion, the new plot is a consistent and computationally efficient graphical analysis method to improve the quanti. cation of reversible tracer binding in radioligand receptor dynamic PET studies.

The high affinity DAT compound N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-methylphenyl)nortropane (PE2I) was radiolabelled by the O-methylation approach and the binding was characterised by PET in cynomolgus monkeys and a healthy man. Metabolite levels in plasma were measured by gradient high-performance liquid chromatography. O-methylation of the corresponding free acid precursor with [C-11]methyl triflate gave high radiochemical yield (80%) and specific radioactivity (55 GBq/mumol). [C-11]PE2I binding in cynomolgus monkeys was nine times higher in the striatum than in the cerebellum at peak equilibrium, which appeared 55-65 min after injection. Displacement and pretreatment measurements using unlabelled beta-CIT, GBR 12909, cocaine, citalopram and maprotiline confirmed that [C-11]PE2I binds selectively to DAT. In a preliminary study in one human subject the radioactivity ratios of the striatum and substantia nigra to the cerebellum were 10 and 1.8, respectively, at peak equilibrium, which appeared at 40-50 min and 20 min, respectively, after injection. The fraction of the total radioactivity in monkey and human plasma representing unchanged [C-11]PE2I was 15-20% at 40 min after injection. The present characterisation of binding in monkey and man suggests that [C-11]PE2I is a suitable PET radioligand for quantitative regional examination of DAT in man.

MPEP also inhibited to a large extent constitutive receptor activity in cells transiently overexpressing rat mGluR5, suggesting that MPEP acts as an inverse agonist, To investigate the molecular determinants that govern selective ligand binding, a mutagenesis study was performed using chimeras and single amino acid substitutions of hmGluR1 and hmGluR5, The mutants were tested for binding of the novel mGluR5 radioligand [H-3]2-methyl-6-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl pyridine (M-MPEP), a close analog of MPEP, Replacement of Ala-810 in transmembrane (TM) VII or Pro-655 and Ser-658 in TMIII with the homologous residues of hmGluR1 abolished radioligand binding, In contrast, the reciprocal hmGluR1 mutant bearing these three residues of hmGluR5 showed high affinity for [H-3]M-MPEP. Radioligand binding to these mutants was also inhibited by 7-hydroxyiminocyclopropan[b]chromen-1a-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (CPC-COEt), a structurally unrelated non-competitive mGluR1 antagonist previously shown to interact with residues Thr-815 and Ala-818 in TMVII of hmGluR1, These results indicate that MPEP and CPCCOEt bind to overlapping binding pockets in the TBI region of group I mGluRs but interact with different non conserved residues.

PET Imaging of α4β2* Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors: Quantitative Analysis of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Nifene Kinetics in the Nonhuman Primate	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						nAChR; PET; nicotine; F-18-nifene; compartment modeling	GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN-BRAIN; BINDING; QUANTIFICATION; RADIOLIGAND; DOPAMINE; RADIOTRACER	The PET radioligand 2-fluoro-3-[2-((S)-3-pyrrolinyl)methoxy]pyridine (F-18-nifene) is an alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist developed to provide accelerated in vivo equilibrium compared with existing alpha 4 beta 2* radioligands. The goal of this work was to analyze the in vivo kinetic properties of F-18-nifene with both kinetic modeling and graphical analysis techniques. Methods: Dynamic PET experiments were performed on 4 rhesus monkeys (female; age range, 9-13 y) using a small-animal PET scanner. Studies began with a high-specific-activity F-18-nifene injection, followed by a coinjection of F-18-nifene and unlabeled nifene at 60 min. Sampling of arterial blood with metabolite analysis was performed throughout the experiment to provide a parent radioligand input function. In vivo kinetics were characterized with both a 1-tissue-compartment model (1TCM) and a 2-tissue-compartment model, Logan graphical methods (both with and without blood sampling), and the multilinear reference tissue model. Total distribution volumes and nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND) were used to compare regional binding of F-18-nifene. Regions examined include the anteroventral thalamus, lateral geniculate body, frontal cortex, subiculum, and cerebellum. Results: The rapid uptake and binding of F-18-nifene in nAChR-rich regions of the brain was appropriately modeled using the 1TCM. No evidence for specific binding of F-18-nifene in the cerebellum was detected on the basis of the coinjection studies, suggesting the suitability of the cerebellum as a reference region. Total distribution volumes in the cerebellum were 6.91 +/- 0.61 mL/cm(3). BPND values calculated with the 1TCM were 1.60 +/- 0.17, 1.35 +/- 0.16, 0.26 +/- 0.08, and 0.30 +/- 0.07 in the anteroventral thalamus, lateral geniculate body, frontal cortex, and subiculum, respectively. For all brain regions, there was a less than 0.04 absolute difference in the average BPND values calculated with each of the 1TCM, multilinear reference tissue model, and Logan methods. Conclusion: The fast kinetic properties and specific regional binding of F-18-nifene promote extension of the radioligand into preclinical animal models and human subjects.

Inhibitors that interact with a specific bromodomain may contribute to a specific therapeutic potential with fewer side effects. However, little is known about this disease-related target. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging could allow us to achieve in-depth knowledge of the BD2 bromodomain. Herein we describe the radiosynthesis and evaluation of [C-11]1 as a BRD4 BD2 bromodomain PET imaging radioligand. Our preliminary PET imaging results in rodents demonstrated that [C-11]1 had suitable biodistribution in peripheral organs and tissues. Further blocking studies indicated that [C-11]1 had good binding specificity toward the BD2 bromodomain. This study may pave the way for the development of a PET radioligand specifically targeting BD1/2 bromodomains as well as for the biological mechanism investigation of BD1/2 bromodomains.

The application of limonene, especially in aromatherapy, has expanded significantly, but its potential effects on cellular metabolism have been elusive. We found that limonene directly binds to the adenosine A(2A) receptor, which may induce sedative effects. Results from an in vitro radioligand binding assay showed that limonene exhibits selective affinity to A(2A) receptors. In addition, limonene increased cytosolic cAMP concentration and induced activation of protein kinase A and phosphorylation of cAMP-response element-binding protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human adenosine A(2A) receptor gene. Limonene also increased cytosolic calcium concentration, which can be achieved by the activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors. These findings suggest that limonene can act as a ligand and an agonist for adenosine A(2A) receptors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A large percentage of these assays are now for-matted as radioligand binding assays. Fluorescence polarization ligand binding assays can offer a non-rad alternative to radioligand binding assays. In addition, fluorescence polarization assays are a homogenous format that is easy to automate for high throughput screening. We have developed a series of peptide ligands labeled with the fluorescent dye BODIPY(R) TMR whose binding to GPCRs can be detected using fluorescence polarization methodology. BODIPY(R) TMR has advantages over the more commonly used fluorescein dye in high throughput screening (HTS) assays due to the fact that its excitation and emission spectra are red-shifted approximately 50 run relative to fluorescein. Assays based on BODIPY(R) TMR ligands are therefore less susceptible to interference from tissue auto-fluorescence in the assay matrix, or the effects of colored or fluorescent compounds in the screening libraries. A series of BODIPY(R) TMR labeled peptides have been prepared that bind to a range of GPCRs including melanin concentrating hormone, bradykinin, and melanocortin receptors. Conditions have been optimized in order to utilize a comparable amount of receptor membrane preparation as is used in a radioligand binding assay. The assays are formatted in 384-well microplates with a standard volume of 40 muL. We have compared the assays across the different fluorescence polarization (FP) readers available to determine the parameters for each instrument necessary to achieve the required precision.

Through a systematic and cost-effective PET discovery process, involving expression level (B (max)) and bio distribution determination, a PET-specific structure-activity relationship (SAR) effort, and specific binding assessment using a LC-MS/MS "cold tracer" method, we have identified 8 (PF-06445974) as a promising PET lead. Compound 8 has exquisite potency at PDE4B, good selectivity over PDE4D, excellent brain permeability, and a high level of specific binding in the "cold tracer" study. In subsequent non-human primate (NHP) PET imaging studies, [F-18]8 showed rapid brain uptake and high target specificity, indicating that [F-18]8 is a promising PDE4B-preferring radioligand for clinical PET imaging.

Here, we detail the C-11-labeling and subsequently evaluate pimavanserin as a PET-radioligand in pigs. [C-11] Pimavanserin was obtained by N-methylation of an appropriate precursor using [C-11] MeOTf in acetone at 60 degrees C giving radiochemical yields in the range of 1-1.7 GBq (n = 4). In Danish Landrace pigs the radio ligand readily entered the brain and displayed binding in the cortex in accordance with the distribution of 5-HT(2A)Rs. However, this binding could not be blocked by either ketanserin or pimavanserin itself, indicating high nonspecific binding. The lack of displacement by the 5-HT2R antagonist and binding in the thalamus suggests that [C-11] pimavanserin is not selective for the 5-HT2AR in pigs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A technique for visualization and quantification of beta(1)-AR populations rather than total beta-AR densities in the human heart would be of great clinical interest. Molecular imaging techniques, either single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), with appropriate radiopharmaceuticals offer the possibility to assess beta-AR density noninvasively in humans, but to date, neither a SPECT nor a PET-radioligand is clinically established for the selective imaging of cardiac beta(1)-ARs. The aim of this study was to design a high affinity selective beta(1)-AR radioligand for the noninvasive in vivo imaging of cardiac beta(1)-AR density in man using SPECT. Based on the well-known selective beta(1)-AR antagonist, ICI 89,406, both the racemic iodinated target compound 11a and the (S)-enantiomer 15a were synthesized. Competition studies using the nonselective AR ligand, [121 I]iodocyanopindolol ([I-125]ICYP), and ventricular membrane preparations from mice showed that 11a and 15a possess higher beta(1)-AR affinities (up to 265-fold) and beta(1)-AR selectivities (up to 245-fold) than ICI 89,406. Encouraged by these results, the radioiodinated counterparts of racemic 11a (11b: 1251, 11c: 121 1) and (S)-configurated 15a (15b: I-125 15c: I-123) were synthesized. The target compounds were evaluated in rats. Biodistribution and metabolism studies in rats indicated that there is a specific heart uptake of 11b-c and especially 15b-c accompanied by rapid metabolism of the radioligands. Therefore, radioiodinated 11c and 15c appeared to be unpromising SPECT-radioligands for assessing beta(1)-ARs in vivo in the rat. However, the rat may metabolize beta-AR ligands more rapidly than other species as demonstrated for (S)-[C-11]CGP 12177, a radioligand structurally related to 11a-c and 15a-c. Therefore further studies in a different animal model will be carried out. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, neurotransmitter receptors and transporters play a key role in shaping brain function. Due to the lack of comprehensive neurotransmitter receptor/transporter density datasets, microarray gene expression measuring mRNA transcripts is often used as a proxy for receptor densities. In the present report, we comprehensively test the spatial correlation between gene expression and protein density for a total of 27 neurotransmitter receptors, receptor binding-sites, and transporters across 9 different neurotransmitter systems, using both PET and autoradiography radioligand-based imaging modalities. We find poor spatial correspondences between gene expression and density for all neurotransmitter receptors and transporters except four single-protein metabotropic receptors (5-HT1A, CB1, D-2, and MOR). These expression-density associations are related to gene differential stability and can vary between cortical and subcortical structures. Altogether, we recommend using direct measures of receptor and transporter density when relating neurotransmitter systems to brain structure and function.

Dopaminergic Neuronal Imaging in Genetic Parkinson's Disease: Insights into Pathogenesis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN GENE; GLUCOCEREBROSIDASE MUTATION; NIGROSTRIATAL DYSFUNCTION; PET; CARRIERS; LRRK2; I-123-FP-CIT; DUPLICATION; TRANSPORTER; PROGRESSION	Objectives: To compare the dopaminergic neuronal imaging features of different subtypes of genetic Parkinson's Disease. Methods: A retrospective study of genetic Parkinson's diseases cases in which DaTSCAN (123I-FP-CIT) had been performed. Specific non-displaceable binding was calculated for bilateral caudate and putamen for each case. The right: left asymmetry index and striatal asymmetry index was calculated. Results: Scans were available from 37 cases of monogenetic Parkinson's disease (7 glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations, 8 alpha-synuclein, 3 LRRK2, 7 PINK1, 12 Parkin). The asymmetry of radioligand uptake for Parkinson's disease with GBA or LRRK2 mutations was greater than that for Parkinson's disease with alpha synuclein, PINK1 or Parkin mutations. Conclusions: The asymmetry of radioligand uptake in Parkinsons disease associated with GBA or LRRK2 mutations suggests that interactions with additional genetic or environmental factors may be associated with dopaminergic neuronal loss.

The studies presented herein characterize [H-3] DH-S1P as a stable, high-affinity radioligand for S1P(4) pharmacology. 3 Using a transfected Ba/F3 cell line selected for high hS1P(4) surface expression, we compared the consequences of different cellular backgrounds and commercial sources of sphingophospholipids on S1P4 characterization. The development and subsequent use of the assay described has enabled us to extensively and definitively characterize the pharmacology of the human S1P(4) receptor.

However, its clinical significance as a liquid biopsy for predicting hematotoxicity and treatment response when targeting tumor cells with ionizing radiation from a systemically administered radioligand is unexplored. The results from this study revealed that the analysis of radiation-induced foci in peripheral blood lymphocytes may hold potential for predicting both individual subclinical hematotoxicity and tumor response to somatostatin-receptor targeted radioligand therapy in patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. These preliminary data provide the rationale for further studies evaluating analyses-guided treatment intensification in patients at high risk of early progression. Background: We aimed to characterize gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci formation in patients receiving somatostatin receptor-targeted radioligand therapy, and explored its role for predicting treatment-related hematotoxicity, and treatment response. Methods: A prospective analysis of double-strand break (DSB) markers was performed in 21 patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci formation were evaluated in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) at baseline, +1 h and +24 h after administration of 7.4 GBq (Lu-177)Lu-DOTA-TATE. Hematotoxicity was evaluated using standard hematology. Therapy response was assessed using (Ga-68)Ga-DOTA-TATE PET/CT before enrollment and after 2 cycles of PRRT according to the volumetric modification of RECIST 1.1. Results: DSB marker kinetics were heterogeneous among patients. Subclinical hematotoxicity was associated with gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci formation (e.g., change in platelet count vs change in gamma-H2AX(+) cells between baseline and +1 h (r = -0.6080; p = 0.0045). Patients showing early development of new metastases had less gamma-H2AX (p = 0.0125) and less 53BP1 foci per cell at +1 h (p = 0.0289), and demonstrated a distinct kinetic pattern with an absence of DSB marker decrease at +24 h (gamma-H2AX: p = 0.0025; 53BP1: p = 0.0008). Conclusions: Assessment of gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 foci formation in PBLs of patients receiving radioligand therapy may hold promise for predicting subclinical hematotoxicity and early treatment response.

We came to the perception that, for each of these phenomena, the theories can be placed into two distinctive categories. The "kinetic" interpretations attribute these phenomena to, respectively, the ability of antagonists to form long-lasting complexes with their cognate receptor and the ability of dissociated ligands to bind again to the same or neighbouring receptors rather than to diffuse away from the cell surface. On the other hand, these observations can also be explained by negative allosteric interactions among topographically distinct ligand binding sites at the same receptor or di/multimeric receptor complex.

The synthetic strategy includes the preparation of the aryl-[1-(2-nitrobenzyl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl]methanones (5a-i) followed by their reduction and subsequent cyclization. Affinities of compounds 3a-i and 4a-i for central benzodiazepine as well as for adenosine A(1)-receptors were determined by radioligand binding assays. Among the unsaturated analogues, the highest activity at both receptors is displayed by 11-(2-thienyl) derivative 3e. The hydrogenated analogues 4a-i do not exhibit considerable binding affinity either for central benzodiazepine or for adenosine A(1)-receptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.

Two halogeno-derivatives of A-85380 are being used in humans. Nevertheless, these derivatives still display too-slow brain kinetics and low signal-to-noise ratio. Methods: A novel nAChR radio-ligand, 5-(6-fluorohexyn-1-yl)-3-[2(S)-2-azetidinylmethoxy] pyridine (ZW-104), was characterized in vitro using competition binding assays (nAChR subtypes heterologously expressed in HEK 293 cells and in native alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs from rat brain). F-18-ZW-104 was prepared as follows: no-carrier-added nucleophilic aliphatic radiofluorination of the corresponding N-Boc-protected tosyloxy derivative 5-(6-tosyloxyhexyn-1-yl)-3-[ 2(S)-(N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl))2-azetidinylmethoxy] pyridine) with the activated 4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo-[ 8,8,8]hexacosane (K-F-18-F-Kryptofix 222 [K-222] complex), followed by quantitative trifluoroacetic acid-induced removal of the N-Boc protective group. F-18-ZW-104 was then studied in baboons using PET. Results: ZW-104 showed high binding affinities for rat alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs (K-i, 0.2 nM) and other subtypes containing the beta 2 subunit but much lower affinities for rat alpha 3 beta 4 nAChRs (Ki, 5,500 nM) and other subtypes containing the beta 4 subunit. The regional radioactivity distribution in the baboon brain matched that of the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR, which was similar to that of 2-F-18-fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2-F-18-A-85380), a radioligand used in humans. Comparison between F-18-ZW-104 and 2-F-18-A-85380 demonstrated better in vivo binding properties of the new radioligand: a substantially greater amount of radioactivity accumulated in the brain, and the occurrence of peak uptake in the thalamus was earlier than that of 2-F-18-A-85380 and was followed by washout. Distribution volume values in different brain regions were 2-fold higher for F-18-ZW-104 than for 2-F-18-A85380. Displacement by nicotine or unlabeled ZW-104 demonstrated a lower nonspecific binding than that of 2-F-A-85380. Conclusion: These results suggest that F-18-ZW-104 is a promising PET radioligand for studying nAChRs containing the beta 2 subunits in humans.

Pluvicto (TM) and other PSMA-targeting radioligand therapeutics (RLTs) have shown side effects due to accumulation in certain healthy tissues, such as salivary glands and kidney. Until now, the molecular mechanism underlying the undesired accumulation of PSMA-targeting RLTs had not been elucidated. Methods We compared the sequence of PSMA with the entire human proteome to identify proteins closely related to the target. We have identified glutamate carboxypeptidase III (GCPIII), N-acetylated alpha-linked acidic dipeptidase like 1 (NAALADL-1), and transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) as extracellular targets with the highest similarity to PSMA. The affinity of compound 1 for PSMA, GCPIII, NAALADL-1, and TfR1 was measured by fluorescence polarization. The expression of the putative anti-target GCPIII was assessed by immunofluorescence on human salivary glands and kidney, using commercially available antibodies. Results A fluorescent derivative of Pluvicto (TM) (compound 1) bound tightly to PSMA and to GCPIII in fluorescence polarization experiments, while no interaction was observed with NAALADL-1 and TfR1. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed abundant expression of GCPIII both in healthy human kidney and salivary glands. Conclusion We conclude that the membranous expression of GCPIII in kidney and salivary gland may be the underlying cause for unwanted accumulation of Pluvicto (TM) and other Glu-ureido PSMA radio pharmaceuticals in patients.

In this study, we explored a new diagnostic approach with PET/MRI of the sigma-1 receptor, a chaperone protein modulating ion channels for activating nociceptive processes.Methods: Our approach is implemented by a simultaneous PET/MRI scan with a novel radioligand [18F]FTC-146, which is highly specific to the sigma-1 receptor. We recruited 5 chronic pelvic pain patients and 5 healthy volunteers and compared our PET/MRI findings between these two groups.Results: All five patients showed abnormally increased radioligand uptake on PET compared to healthy controls at various organs, including the uterus, vagina, pelvic bowel, gluteus maximus muscle, and liver. However, on MRI, only 2 patients showed abnormalities that could be potentially associated with the pain symptoms. For a subset of patients, the association of pain and the abnormally increased radioligand uptake was further validated by successful pain relief outcomes following surgery or trigger point injections to the identified abnormalities.Conclusion: In this preliminary study, sigma-1 receptor PET/MRI demonstrated potential for identifying abnormalities associated with chronic pelvic pain. Future studies will need to correlate samples with imaging findings to further validate the correlation between S1R distribution and pathologies of chronic pelvic pain.Trial Registration: The clinical trial registration date is June 2, 2018, and the registration number of the study is NCT03195270 (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03556137).

This study identified and confirmed angiotensin II (ATII) as a strong activator of signaling in NEN cells and its cognate receptor AGTR1 as overexpressed in human small intestinal NEN. NEN cells with high AGTR1 expression exhibited cellular activation and secretion upon stimulation with ATII. AGTR1 ligand saralasin coupled to a fluorescent dye demonstrated tumor accumulation in an animal model of NEN. This proof of concept establishes AGTR1 as a novel target in NEN, paving the way for its potential use in diagnostic PET imaging and radioligand therapy. This study identified and confirmed angiotensin II (ATII) as a strong activator of signaling in neuroendocrine neoplasm (NEN) cells. Expression analyses of the ATII receptor type 1 (AGTR1) revealed an upregulation of mRNA levels (RT-qPCR) and radioligand binding (autoradiography) in small-intestinal (n = 71) NEN tissues compared to controls (n = 25). NEN cells with high AGTR1 expression exhibited concentration-dependent calcium mobilization and chromogranin A secretion upon stimulation with ATII, blocked by AGTR1 antagonism and G alpha q inhibition. ATII also stimulated serotonin secretion from BON cells. AGTR1 ligand saralasin was coupled to a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye and tested for its biodistribution in a nude mouse model bearing AGTR1-positive BON and negative QGP-1 xenograft tumors. NIRF imaging showed significantly higher uptake in BON tumors. This proof of concept establishes AGTR1 as a novel target in NEN, paving the way for translational chelator-based probes for diagnostic PET imaging and radioligand therapy.

Methods: The precursor compound (5a + 5b) and reference standard (6) were synthesized in multistep syntheses. Recombinant human MAO-B and MAO-A enzyme preparations were used to determine inhibitory concentrations of 50%. Radiolabeling was accomplished by a nucleophilic substitution reaction. Whole-hemisphere autoradiography was performed with F-18-fluorodeprenyl-D-2. A PET study was performed on a cynomolgus monkey. Radiometabolites were measured in monkey plasma using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: The 50% inhibitory concentration of compound 6 for MAO-B was 227 +/- 36.8 nM. Radiolabeling was accomplished with high radiochemical yield, purity, and specific radioactivity. The autoradiography binding density of F-18-fluorodeprenyl-D-2 was consistent with known MAO-B expression in the human brain. In vivo, F-18-fluorodeprenyl-D-2 showed favorable kinetic properties, with relatively fast washout from the brain. Regional time activity curves were better described by the 2-tissue-compartment model. Administration of a 1 mg/kg dose of L-deprenyl yielded 70% inhibition of MAO-B in all regions. Radiometabolite studies demonstrated 20% unchanged radioligand at 120 min after injection. F-18-fluorodeprenyl-D-2 showed less irreversibility than did previously reported MAO-B radioligands. Conclusion: The results suggest that F-18-fluorodeprenyl-D-2 is a suitable PET radioligand for visualization of MAO-B activity in the human brain.

Characterization of new G protein-coupled adenine receptors in mouse and hamster	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Adenine receptor; G protein-coupled receptor; Sf9 insect cells; Chinese hamster ovary cells; Radioligand binding; Mrg receptor	2ND EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; BINDING; FAMILY; CELLS; MODEL; CAMP	The nucleobase adenine has previously been reported to activate G protein-coupled receptors in rat and mouse. Adenine receptors (AdeR) thus constitute a new family of purine receptors, for which the designation "P0-receptors" has been suggested. We now describe the cloning and characterization of two new members of the AdeR family from mouse (MrgA10, termed mAde1R) and hamster (cAdeR). Both receptors were expressed in Sf9 insect cells, and radioligand binding studies were performed using [H-3]adenine. Specific binding of the radioligand was detected in transfected, but not in untransfected cells, and K (D) values of 286 nM (mAde1R, B (max) 1.18 pmol/mg protein) and 301 nM (cAdeR, B (max) 17.7 pmol/mg protein), respectively, were determined. A series of adenine derivatives was investigated in competition binding assays. Minor structural modifications generally led to a reduction or loss of affinity, with one exception: 2-fluoroadenine was at least as potent as adenine itself at the cAdeR. Structure-activity relationships at all AdeR orthologs and subtypes investigated so far were similar, but not identical. For functional analyses, the cAdeR was homologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, while the mAde1R was heterologously expressed in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells. Like the previously described AdeRs from rat (rAdeR) and mouse (mAde2R), the mAde1R (EC50 9.77 nM) and the cAdeR (EC50 51.6 nM) were coupled to inhibition of adenylate cyclase. In addition, the cAdeR from hamster expressed in CHO cells produced an increase in intracellular calcium concentrations (EC50 6.24 nM) and was found to be additionally coupled to G(q) proteins.

Preliminary Assessment of the Anti-inflammatory Activity of New Structural Honokiol Analogs with a 4′-<i>O</i>-(2-Fluoroethyl) Moiety and the Potential of Their <SUP>18</SUP>F-Labeled Derivatives for Neuroinflammation Imaging	MOLECULES			English	Article						structural analogs of honokiol; fluorine-18; neuroinflammation; radioligand; anti-inflammatory activity; cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)	PET RADIOLIGANDS; 4-O-METHYLHONOKIOL; LIPOPHILICITY; RADIOTRACER; MODEL	Neolignans honokiol and 4 & PRIME;-O-methylhonokiol (MH) and their derivatives have pronounced anti-inflammatory activity, as evidenced by numerous pharmacological studies. Literature data suggested that cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) may be a target for these compounds in vitro and in vivo. Recent studies of [C-11]MPbP (4 & PRIME;-[C-11]methoxy-5-propyl-1,1 & PRIME;-biphenyl-2-ol) biodistribution in LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-treated rats have confirmed the high potential of MH derivatives for imaging neuroinflammation. Here, we report the synthesis of four structural analogs of honokiol, of which 4 & PRIME;-(2-fluoroethoxy)-2-hydroxy-5-propyl-1, 1 & PRIME;-biphenyl (F-IV) was selected for labeling with fluorine-18 (T-1/2 = 109.8 min) due to its high anti-inflammatory activity confirmed by enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and neuromorphological studies. The high inhibitory potency of F-IV to COX-2 and its moderate lipophilicity and chemical stability are favorable factors for the preliminary evaluation of the radioligand [F-18]F-IV in a rodent model of neuroinflammation. [F-18]F-IV was prepared with good radiochemical yield and high molar activity and radiochemical purity by F-18-fluoroethylation of the precursor with Boc-protecting group (15) with [F-18]2-fluoro-1-bromoethane ([F-18]FEB). Ex vivo biodistribution studies revealed a small to moderate increase in radioligand uptake in the brain and peripheral organs of LPS-induced rats compared to control animals. Pretreatment with celecoxib resulted in significant blocking of radioactivity uptake in the brain (pons and medulla), heart, lungs, and kidneys, indicating that [F-18]F-IV is likely to specifically bind to COX-2 in a rat model of neuroinflammation. However, in comparison with [C-11]MPbP, the new radioligand showed decreased brain uptake in LPS rats and high retention in the blood pool, which apparently could be explained by its high plasma protein binding. We believe that the structure of [F-18]F-IV can be optimized by replacing the substituents in the biphenyl core to eliminate these disadvantages and develop new radioligands for imaging activated microglia.

Methods Using positron emission tomography (PET), we explored the association of the distribution of activated microglia, as measured by the radioligand [C-11]PK11195, and the regional distribution of tau or TDP-43 pathology, indexed using the radioligand [F-18]AV-1451. The familial FTD PET data were compared with healthy controls. Results Patients with familial FTD across all mutation groups showed increased [C-11]PK11195 binding predominantly in frontotemporal regions, with additional regions showing abnormalities in individuals. Patients with MAPT mutations had a consistent distribution of [F-18]AV-1451 binding across the brain, with heterogeneous distributions among carriers of GRN and C9orf72 mutations. Discussion This case series suggests that neuroinflammation is part of the pathophysiology of familial FTD, warranting further consideration of immunomodulatory therapies for disease modification and prevention.

To our knowledge this is the first CCK4-based radioligand that presents a high affinity for the CCK2R, a high and specific tumor uptake, a low renal accumulation and a very good visualization of tumors in vivo compared with an internal control, (111)Indium-trans-cyclohexyldiethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid-cholecystokinin octapeptide (In-111-CHX-A ''-DTPA-CCK8).

Radioligand therapy (RLT) targeting the overexpressed PSMA on PC cells, with, e.g., Lu-177-PSMA-617, has been effective in reducing tumor burden and prolonging survival in mCRPC. However, it is not a curative method with kidney and bone marrow toxicity limiting the activity given to patients. Previous preclinical models have reported transient hematotoxicity for up to 120 MBq. This activity may still be too low to investigate the effect on renal function since it corresponds to an absorbed dose below 10 Gy, whereas the kidneys in a clinical setting usually receive an absorbed dose more than double. Here we investigated the hematotoxicity and recovery after administered activities of 120, 160, and 200 MBq in a Lu-177-PSMA-617 BALB/cAnNRj mouse model. The animals had an initial drop in white blood cells (WBC) starting 4 days post injection, which recovered after 21 days. The effect on red blood cells (RBC) and platelets was detected later; 17 days post-injection levels decreased compared to the control group. The reduction was restored again 32 days post injection. No correlation between injected activity and hematotoxicity was found. Our results suggest that activities up to 200 MBq of Lu-177-PSMA-617 give transient hematotoxicity from which animals recover within a month and no radiation-related deaths. Injecting these high activities could allow animal studies with increased clinical relevance when studying renal toxicity in animal models.

Patients and Methods Between November 2014 and December 2018, a total of 56 consecutive patients (median age 69.5 years; range 55-84 years) with mCRPC were included in this retrospective analysis. Patients received between 1 and 4 therapy cycles with a mean activity of 6.8 GBq per cycle. Biochemical response was evaluated using Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria 3 (PCWG 3). Survival was assessed using Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results A total of 139 treatment cycles with Lu-177-PSMA-617 were performed. A decline of 50% or more of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level occurred in 54% and a PSA decline of any amount in 65% of patients. The estimated median overall survival (OS) was 16 months, in the chemotherapy subgroup 14 months. A longer OS was associated with a PSA-decline >= 50%, more than 2 cycles of therapy, cumulative activity >15 GBq and an initial alkaline phosphatase <= 220 [U/l]. These identified predictors remained significant on uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. Moreover, 40% of the patients who were non-responders after the first therapy cycle turned into responders after the second one. Conclusion PSA-decline >= 50%, a cumulative activity >15 GBq and an initial alkaline phosphatase <= 220 [U/l] were identified as key predictors of prolonged OS in patients with mCRPC. In contrast rapid clinical deterioration mostly due to skeletal carcinomatosis resulted in early treatment failure.

Methods: The interaction of available gepants with the CGRP receptor was studied in the brain membranes of 3 different species using a radioligand competitive binding assay. In addition, the distribution of CGRP and its receptor component receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) in rat cerebellum and cortex was explored using immunohistochemistry. Results: All gepants, except SB268262, displaced 100% of the radioligand specific binding in the brain tissue of all 3 species and showed highest affinity for CGRP receptors in human brain as compared to rat and pig brain membranes. Furthermore, radioligand binding studies revealed the presence of higher CGRP receptor density in human cerebellum compared to human cortex. The morphology, size and density of CGRP immunoreactive cells suggest that all cerebral cortical neurons were positive for CGRP. Slender receptor immunoreactive fibres were found spanning through the entire cortex. CGRP immunoreactivity was displayed in the cell soma of cerebellar Purkinje cells and in large neurons in the medial cerebellar nucleus. RAMP1 was found on the surface of the Purkinje cells and in parallel fibres, indicating presence in the granule cell axons. Conclusion: Cerebellum and cerebral cortex are rich in CGRP and CGRP receptors, which can be antagonized by gepants. However, all gepants display higher affinity for human CGRP receptors as compared to rat and pig CGRP receptors. Furthermore, human cerebellum seems to express higher density of CGRP receptors.

Although [F-18]THK-523 and [F-18]T807 are considered high-affinity selective radioligands for NFTs, uncertainty has existed as to whether PET radioligands for imaging NFTs bind to the same molecular site because in vitro assays for ligands binding to NFTs have been lacking. We labeled THK-523 and T807 with tritium to serve as reference radioligands for in vitro binding assays with AD brain homogenates for newly synthesized ligands. With these radioligands, we identified two distinct binding sites for small molecules, one site with high affinity for THK-523 and the other with high affinity for T807. Moreover, binding assays with [H-3]PIB confirmed that the two newly identified binding sites are also distinct from the thioflavin-T binding site where all current clinically useful PET radioligands for imaging beta-amyloid plaque bind with high affinity. The two newly identified binding sites are considered to reside on NFTs rather than on beta-amyloid plaques. Furthermore, we applied all three binding assays to a set of newly prepared compounds, based on chain modifications to THK-523. Some compounds with high affinity and selectivity for the THK-523 binding site emerged from this set, including one with amenability to labeling with. fluorine-18, namely, ligand 10b.

The method is labor-intensive, prone to rater bias and may show low reproducibility. Automated template-based methods for ROI definition may overcome these limitations. The aim of this study was to validate the two automated methods FreeSurfer and the AAL template for definition of ROIs for the PET data analysis. PET data obtained using the radioligands [C-11]AZD2184 (amyloid-beta radioligand) and [C-11]AZ10419369 (5-HT1B receptor radioligand) were evaluated. PET measurements acquired on one high and one lower resolution PET system were included. Outcome measures obtained using automated methods were compared to those obtained using manual ROIs, using linear regression analysis, intraclass correlation coefficients, and repeated measures ANOVA. ROIs provided by the automatic methods were larger than the manually delineated regions, which in some cases introduced biased estimates of the outcome measures. However, with the exception of the caudate, both AAL and FreeSurfer generally provided outcome measures that were in good agreement to those obtained from manually delineated ROIs, as long as the manually defined cerebellum was used as a reference region. Both AAL and FreeSurfer can be used for quantification of PET data, with similar accuracy in the estimates of outcome measures. Thus, the choice of method could be based upon necessity of fast analysis as provided by AAL, or more detailed ROIs and measures of cortical thickness as provided by FreeSurfer.

This study was carried out in rats to investigate regional values for maximal binding and ED50 (a measure of apparent K-d) for the radioligand in vivo in control animals and in a group pretreated with the neuronal impulse flow inhibitor, gamma-butyrolactone. The aims were to obtain further information regarding the specific activity needed to ensure tracer kinetics and to investigate baseline occupancy by dopamine (DA), each relevant to optimal clinical use of the radioligand. Regional B-max values were consistent with the distribution of D-2-like receptors in rat brain. Of interest, 60% of the binding in cerebellum, often used as a low-binding "reference region" for PET quantification, was saturable, with B-max only 2- to 3-fold less than that in neocortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. ED50 values were in the range 2-3 nmol/kg, confirming minimal receptor occupancy by the tracer in human PET, using high but achievable specific activities. In the majority of extrastriatal tissues, reduction in synaptic DA did not significantly decrease the apparent Kd, except in cortical regions, where the extent of the effect suggested a low (similar to 10%), but measurable baseline receptor occupancy by DA.

LuPSMA is considered as an experimental treatment not yet used in routine practice. Here, we report our experience following the introduction of LuPSMA therapy at our institution. Methods Referred mCRPC patients were assessed for treatment suitability including Gallium-68-PSMA PET/CT and blood tests. Suitable patients underwent up to four cycles of LuPSMA treatment. Response to treatment was assessed by changes in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Toxicity was assessed by recording of adverse events. Results In an 18 month period, 50 patients underwent 132 cycles of LuPSMA therapy. Patients underwent a median of three cycles each (range: 1-4) and the mean administered amount of activity per cycle was 5.9 GBq (range: 3.5-8.2 GBq). PSA decline could be calculated for 49 patients, with a best PSA decline of >= 50% observed in 22 patients (44.9%). Adverse events were reported across 45 of 132 LuPSMA cycles. Most adverse events were grade I (42/45) and the remaining three events were grade II. Conclusion Initial experience at our site supports the use of LuPSMA as an emerging safe and effective treatment for mCRPC. Since introducing LuPSMA therapy at our institution, 44.9% of patients have experienced a decline in PSA level >= 50% with low or minimal toxicity. This is an important finding as these patients had previously exhausted all available treatment options. Overall, we have found patients and their primary care doctors have eagerly accepted LuPSMA as another line of defence against mCRPC.

Radioligand binding assay has been the method of choice for screening novel dopaminergic drugs for decades. We demonstrate that fluorescent ligand BodipyFL-SKF83566 binding to dopamine D-1 receptors expressed in budded baculovirus particles can be characterized with fluorescent anisotropy (FA) based assay and that this is a valuable alternative to the radioligand binding assay. High binding affinity (K-D = 5.2 nM) and fast association and dissociation kinetics (half-lives 40 s and 70 s, respectively) make BodipyFL-SKF83566 a suitable fluorescent ligand for this type of experiments. Good correlation between pK(i) values of 11 different dopaminergic ligands determined in competition binding experiments with radioligand [H-3]SCH23390 or BodipyFL-SKF83566 (R-2 = 0.96, slope not significantly different from unity) further validates the FA assay. In addition to competitor's affinity, the method also enables to quantify the apparent pIC(50) values in time and hence kinetic properties of an unlabeled ligand can be estimated from the same competition binding experiment. Due to the homogenous nature of the FA assay reactions can be monitored in real time without any risk of precipitation of receptors in budded baculovirus particles. Despite the lack of coupled G proteins, the proposed novel assay system allows on-line monitoring of ligand binding to dopamine D-1 receptors that could be easily applicable in early drug screening.

This study sought to quantitatively measure the "signal to background'' ratio (assessed as binding potential (BPND)) of C-11-(R)-PK11195 compared to one of the most promising second-generation radioligands, C-11-(R)-PK11195 . Healthy subjects had dynamic PET scans and arterial blood measurements of radioligand after injection of either C-11-(R)-PK11195 (16 subjects) or C-11-DPA-713 (22 subjects). To measure the amount of specific binding, a subset of these subjects was scanned after administration of the TSPO blocking drug XBD173 (30-90 mg PO). C-11-(R)-PK11195 showed a significant sensitivity to genotype in brain, whereas C-11-(R)-PK11195did not. Lassen occupancy plot analysis revealed that the specific binding of C-11-DPA-713 was much greater than that of C-11-(R)-PK11195. The BPND in high-affinity binders was about 10-fold higher for C-11-DPA-713 (7.3) than for C-11-(R)-PK11195 (0.75). Although the high specific binding of C-11-DPA-713 suggests it is an ideal ligand to measure TSPO, we also found that its distribution volume increased over time, consistent with the accumulation of radiometabolites in brain.

Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies targeting the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) have been limited by high nonspecific binding of the first-generation radioligand, low-resolution scanners, small sample sizes, and psychotic patients being on antipsychotics or not being in the first episode of their illness. The present study uses the novel second-generation TSPO PET radioligand [F-18]FEPPA to evaluate whether microglial activation is elevated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of untreated patients with first-episode psychosis. Method: Nineteen untreated patients with first-episode psychosis (14 of them antipsychotic naive) and 20 healthy volunteers underwent a high-resolution [F-18]FEPPA PET scan and MRI. Dynamic PET data were analyzed using the validated two-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma input function with total volume of distribution (V-T) as outcome measure. All analyses were corrected for TSPO rs6971 polymorphism (which is implicated in differential binding affinity). Results: No significant differences were observed between patients and healthy volunteers in microglial activation, as indexed by [F-18]FEPPA V-T, in either the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus. There were no significant correlations between [F-18]FEPPA V-T and duration of illness, clinical presentation, or neuropsychological measures after adjusting for multiple testing. Conclusions: The lack of significant differences in [F-18]FEPPA V-T between groups suggests that microglial activation is not present in first-episode psychosis.

J	Wittmann, HJ; Strasser, A				Wittmann, Hans-Joachim; Strasser, Andrea			Competitive association binding kinetic assays: a new tool to detect two different binding orientations of a ligand to its target protein under distinct conditions?	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Competitive binding kinetics; Different binding orientations; Rate constant of association; Rate constant of dissociation	RESIDENCE TIME; DRUG TARGETS; RECEPTOR; HISTAPRODIFENS; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM; AGONISTS; OPINION	Within the last years, for several ligands, binding to G protein-coupled receptors or other target proteins, a binding of the ligand in two different orientations is described. One appropriate experimental technique to detect two different binding orientations is the crystallization of the ligand-protein-complex, but crystallization and subsequent X-ray analysis do not belong to the routine methods. By traditional competitive radioligand equilibrium binding assays, it is not possible to detect or to distinguish between two different binding orientations, but there is a possibility to identify two different binding orientations by performing kinetic competitive radioligand-binding assays. To study the limitations of this new technique, the related differential equations were defined and solved numerically for 8 different sets of rate constants, also considering an experimental error up to similar to 10%. In principal, the kinetic competitive radioligand binding assay is a suitable technique to detect two different ligand binding orientations. However, the present study shows that this is only possible under distinct conditions: (1) the rate constants of dissociation for both binding orientations of the cold ligand should at least be >> 10-fold different to each other and (2) the experimental error should be as small as possible. Although there are some limitations for the experimental usability of this method, it is worthwhile to perform kinetic competitive binding assays, especially if there are hints for two binding orientations of a ligand, e.g. based on molecular modelling studies.

In this study, the potential for quantitative analysis of [C-11]AZ10419369 binding to central 5-HT1B receptors was evaluated in human subjects. PET measurements were performed after injection of [C-11]AZ10419369 in 10 subjects. Data were analyzed with kinetic modeling and linear graphical analysis using the arterial plasma as input function, and with reference tissue models using cerebellar cortex as the reference region. Binding of [C-11]AZ10419369 was highest in pallidum, ventral striatum, and occipital cortex and lowest in cerebellum. The percentage of unchanged radioligand in plasma was 97% to 99%, indicating that no significant amounts of radioactive metabolites were formed during the time of analysis. Time-activity curves of [C-11]AZ10419369 could be described with both one-tissue compartment (1-TC) and two-tissue compartment (2-TC) models in the majority of subjects. The 2-TC model failed to deliver reasonable estimates of the kinetic parameters. However, stable estimates of binding potential (BPND) were obtained by constraining K-1/k(2) to the distribution volume obtained with the 1-TC model in the cerebellar cortex. BPND values estimated with reference tissue models were correlated with the corresponding values obtained with kinetic modeling. The findings support the use of reference tissue models in applied clinical studies with [C-11]AZ10419369.

Methods Patients from the University Hospital Bonn and the University Hospital Aachen were retrospectively reviewed for this study. We included 48 patients with mCRPC who were treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 and whose records included Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT imaging before the first and after the third or fourth treatment cycle. A treatment response based on Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT was defined according to a modified version of the PERCIST criteria. A decline in PSA level of >= 50% was considered the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and ROC curves were calculated, and patient survival times in relation to the PET results were also analysed. Results Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT had a sensitivity of about 85% and a specificity of between 55% and 65%. The negative and positive predictive values ranged between 70% and 78%. The fitted ROC area was 0.70. The survival time was about 19.6 months in patients with a treatment response, while nonresponders had a survival time of about 15.9 months. However, this difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion Our results indicate that Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT could be a useful tool for the evaluation of response to Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy within a theranostic framework.

Development and validation of an LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the triple reuptake inhibitor indatraline enabling its quantification in MS Binding Assays	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Indatraline; hNET; Validation; Binding; LC-MS	BIOGENIC-AMINE TRANSPORTERS; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS; DRUG DISCOVERY; DOPAMINE; QUANTITATION; MEMBRANES; RADIOLIGAND; BLOCKERS	We herein present the first LC-MS/MS quantification method for indatraline, a highly potent nonselective inhibitor of the three monoamine transporters (for dopamine, DAT; norepinephrine, NET; serotonin, SERT), and its application to MS Binding Assays. For HPLC, an R18 column with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and ammonium bicarbonate buffer (5 mmol L-1, pH 10.0) in a ratio of 90:10 (v/v) at a flow rate of 600 mu L min(-1) was used. Recording indatraline at m/z 292.2/261.0 and (H-2(7))-indatraline, employed as internal standard, at m/z 299.2/268.0 allowed reliable quantification from 5 pmol L-1 (LLOQ) to 5 nmol L-1 in biological matrices without additional sample preparation. Validation of the developed quantification method showed that selectivity, calibration standard curve, accuracy, as well as precision meet the criteria of the CDER guideline. Applying this method to mass spectrometry (MS) Binding Assays, a label-free MS-based alternative to conventional radioligand binding assays, binding of indatraline's eutomer, (1R,3S)-indatraline, towards NET could be characterized directly for the first time, revealing an equilibrium dissociation constant (K (d)) of 805 pmol L-1. Additionally, it could be shown that the established MS Binding Assays enable characterization of test compounds in competition experiments. As the established setup is based on a 96-well format and an LC MS/MS method with a short chromatographic cycle time (1.5 min), the developed MS Binding Assays enable considerable throughput and are therefore well suited as substitute for corresponding radioligand binding assays.

Synthesis and evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Cimbi-806 as a potential PET ligand for 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor imaging	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						[C-11]2-(2 ',6 '-dimethoxy-[1,1 '-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine; 5-HT7 receptor; PET; [C-11]Cimbi-806	HUMAN BRAIN; AMISULPRIDE; RADIOLIGAND; DEPRESSION	2-(2 ',6 '-Dimethoxy-[1,1 '-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine has been identified as a potent ligand for the serotonin 7 (5-HT7) receptor. In this study, we describe the synthesis, radiolabeling and in vivo evaluation of [C-11]2-(2 ',6 '-dimethoxy-[1,1 '-biphenyl]-3-yl)-N,N-dimethylethanamine ([C-11]Cimbi-806) as a radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT7 receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). Precursor and reference compound was synthesized and subsequent C-11-labelling with [C-11]methyltriflate produced [C-11]Cimbi-806 in specific activities ranging from 50 to 300 GBq/mu mol. Following intravenous injection, brain uptake and distribution of [C-11]Cimbi-806 was assessed with PET in Danish Landrace pigs. The time-activity curves revealed high brain uptake in thalamic and striatal regions (SUV similar to 2.5) and kinetic modeling resulted in distribution volumes (V-T) ranging from 6 mL/cm(3) in the cerebellum to 12 mL/cm(3) in the thalamus. Pretreatment with the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 did not result in any significant changes in [C-11]Cimbi-806 binding in any of the analyzed regions. Despite the high brain uptake and relevant distribution pattern, the absence of appropriate in vivo blocking with a 5-HT7 receptor selective compounds renders the conclusion that [C-11]Cimbi-806 is not an appropriate PET radioligand for imaging the 5-HT7 receptor in vivo.

We previously developed [F-18]fluoropropylcurcumin ([F-18]FP-curcumin), which demonstrated excellent binding affinity (K-i = 0.07 nM) for A beta(1-40) aggregates and good pharmacokinetics in normal mouse brains. However, its initial brain uptake was poor (0.52% ID/g at 2 min post-injection). Therefore, in the present study, fluorine-substituted 4,4'-bissubstituted or pegylated curcumin derivatives were synthesized and evaluated. Their binding affinities for A beta(1-42) aggregates were measured and 1-(4-fluoroethyl)-7-(4'-methyl) curcumin (1) had the highest binding affinity (K-i = 2.12 nM). Fluorescence staining of Tg APP/PS-1 mouse brain sections demonstrated high and specific labeling of A beta plaques by 1 in the cortex region, which was confirmed with thioflavin-S staining of the same spots in the adjacent brain sections. Radioligand [F-18]1 was found to have an appropriate partition coefficient (logP(o/w) = 2.40), and its tissue distribution in normal mice demonstrated improved brain permeability (1.44% ID/g at 2 min post-injection) compared to that of [F-18]FP-curcumin by a factor of 2.8 and fast wash-out from mouse brains (0.45% ID/g at 30 min post-injection). These results suggest that [F-18]1 may hold promise as a PET radioligand for A beta plaque imaging. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We developed a novel positron-emitting radioligand based on the NPY2 receptor antagonist JNJ-31020028 (N-(4-(4-[2-(diethylamino)-2-oxo-1-phenylethyl]piperazin-1-yl)-3-fluorophenyl)-2-pyridin-3-ylbenzamide) and used the radiotracer for PET brain imaging in pigs. Methods: In vitro receptor autoradiography studies were performed to establish the anatomic distribution of NPY2 receptors in the pig brain. In vivo, baseline 90-min PET recordings of N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 were conducted in anesthetized Yorkshire x Landrace pigs, concurrent with arterial blood sampling. Postchallenge scans were conducted after injection of unlabeled JNJ-31020028 as a pharmacologic intervention. Cyclosporine A was used to enhance levels of the PET radiotracer in the brain. The PET images were manually coregistered to a MR imaging atlas of the pig brain. Maps of the N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 volume of distribution in the brain were prepared, and regional binding potentials of NPY2 receptors toward the radioligand were calculated using the simplified reference tissue method. Results: In autoradiography studies, N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 receptor binding sites were observed primarily in the hippocampus and were inhibited by unlabeled JNJ-31020028. In PET studies, N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 was metabolized slowly in the blood-stream, with 25% of the C-11-labeled parent compound remaining 30 min after injection. PET imaging showed baseline binding potentials of 0.64 +/- 0.07 in the thalamus, 0.55 +/- 0.02 in the caudate, and 0.49 +/- 0.03 in the hippocampus. Graphical reference region analyses demonstrated that N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 binding was reversible; infusion of unlabeled JNJ-31020028 markedly displaced the PET radioligand from binding sites in the hippocampus, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum but not in the corpus callosum, which served as reference region for nonspecific binding. Conclusion: N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 has several suitable properties for PET neuroimaging of NPY2 receptors. First, it is metabolized slowly in the bloodstream of pigs. Second, using cyclosporine, the target-to-background ratio of N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 is sufficient for estimating pharmacokinetic parameters. Third, N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 binds reversibly and competitively to cerebral sites known to contain relatively high numbers of NPY2 receptors, such as the hippocampus, thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum. Fourth, white matter such as corpus callosum, known to contain negligible numbers of NPY2 receptors, can serve as a reference region for estimating binding potentials in brain regions. To our knowledge, there is no other radioligand with these favorable properties and with this specificity for NPY2 receptors, which makes N-C-11-methyl-JNJ-31020028 the first candidate radioligand for PET investigations of NPY2 receptors in the living brain.

Development of a Selective and High Affinity Radioligand, [<SUP>3</SUP>H]VU6013720, for the M<sub>4</sub> Muscarinic ReceptorS	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Bmax; maximal binding; CHO-K1; Chinese hamster ovary K1; Kd; equilibrium dissociation constant; Ki; equilibrium inhibitory constant; M; muscarinic; NMS; N-methyl scopolamine; PAM; positive allosteric modulator; PET; positron emission tomography; WT; wild-type	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; MESSENGER-RNAS; LOCALIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; MODULATION; PROTEINS; BRAIN; PROBE	M-4 muscarinic receptors are highly expressed in the striatum and cortex, brain regions that are involved in diseases such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, and dystonia. Despite potential therapeutic advantages of specifically targeting the M-4 receptor, it has been historically challenging to develop highly selective ligands, resulting in undesired off-target activity at other members of the muscarinic receptor family. Recently, we have reported first-in-class, potent, and selective M-4 receptor antagonists. As an extension of that work, we now report the development and characterization of a radiolabeled M-4 receptor antagonist, [H-3]VU6013720, with high affinity (pK(d) of 9.5 +/- 0.2 at rat M-4, 9.7 at mouse M-4, and 10 +/- 0.1 at human M-4 with atropine to define nonspecific binding) and no significant binding at the other muscarinic subtypes. Binding assays using this radioligand in rodent brain tissues demonstrate loss of specific binding in Chrm4 knockout animals. Dissociation kinetics experiments with various muscarinic ligands show differential effects on the dissociation of [H-3]VU6013720 from M-4 receptors, suggesting a binding site that is overlapping but may be distinct from the orthosteric site. Overall, these results demonstrate that [H-3]VU6013720 is the first highly selective antagonist radioligand for the M-4 receptor, representing a useful tool for studying the basic biology of M-4 as well for the support of M-4 receptor-based drug discovery.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of different pretherapeutic parameters on the therapeutic response measured by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 2 mo after RLT. Methods: RLT was performed in 40 hormone-refractory patients with distant metastases and progressive disease (mean age, 71.4 y). Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT was performed in all patients 1-2 wk before RLT. All patients were treated with a mean of 6 GBq. The SUVmax of tumor lesions was determined using region-of-interest analysis. Complete blood counts, renal and liver function assessments, previous therapies, pain medication, and SUVs were included in the analysis. PSA was assessed 2 mo after RLT. Results: In the univariate analysis, younger age, higher levels of-y-glutamyl transferase, lower pretherapeutic hemoglobin, a higher Gleason score, a higher number of platelets, higher C-reactive protein, regular need for pain medication, and higher lactate dehydrogenase had a negative impact on the therapeutic response; however, the multivariate analysis revealed that the most significant independent factors were the number of platelets and regular need for pain medication. The response was independent of the amount of PSMA uptake as well as previous therapies and other measured factors. Conclusion: A PSA decline of more than 50% was observed significantly more in patients without a regular need for analgesics.

Opioid binding characteristics of [(3) H]14-methoxymetopon were determined using radioligand binding assay in rat brain membranes. [(3) H]14-Methoxymetopon specifically labelled a single class of opioid sites with affinity in low subnanomolar range (K (i) = 0.43 nm) and maximal number of binding sites of 314 fmol/mg protein. Binding of [(3) H]14-methoxymetopon was inhibited by ligands selective for the mu-opioid receptor with high potency, while selective kappa-opioids and delta-opioids were weaker inhibitors. 14-Methoxymetopon increased guanosine-5'-O -(3-[(35) S]thio)-triphosphate ([(35) S]GTPgammaS) binding with an EC50 of 70.9 nm, thus, providing evidence for the agonist character of this ligand. The increase of [(35) S]GTPgammaS binding was inhibited by naloxone and selective mu-opioid antagonists, indicating a mu-opioid receptor-mediated action. [(3) H]14-Methoxymetopon is one of the few nonpeptide mu-opioid receptor agonists available in radiolabelled form up to now. Due to its high affinity and selectivity, high stability and extremely low nonspecific binding (<10%), this radioligand would be an important and useful tool in probing mu-opioid receptor mechanisms, as well as to promote a further understanding of the opioid system at the cellular and molecular level.

All of the new targeting probes and metallated ligands were purified by RP-HPLC, characterized by ESI-MS, and evaluated for IC50.

Bulk polymers and spherical polymer nanoparticles based on methacrylic acid and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the functional monomer and crosslinker, respectively, were prepared in acetonitrile. The selectivity was evaluated by radioligand binding assays. The imprinted polymers were very specific to beta-estradiol since the control polymers bound virtually none of the radioligand. The bulk polymer was then employed to screen endocrine disrupting chemicals. Structurally related steroids like alpha-estradiol, estrone and ethynylestradiol showed, respectively, 14.0, 5.0 and 0.7% of relative binding to the beta-estradiol polymer, whereas most unrelated chemicals did not bind at all. These results are compared to those obtained with a bioassay using stably transfected yeast cells in culture bearing the human estrogen receptor. The receptor was activated by several estrogen-like chemicals and to a lesser extent by some structurally related chemicals.

A radiometabolite study of the serotonin transporter PET radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MADAM	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin transporter; MADAM; Positron emission tomography; Metabolism	IN-VIVO; SPECT; QUANTIFICATION; SITES; BRAIN; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; TOMOGRAPHY; DEPRESSION; I-123-ADAM; SULFIDES	Introduction: C-11]MADAM is a radioligand suitable for PET studies of the serotonin transporter (SERT). Metabolite analysis in human and non-human plasma samples using HPLC separation has shown that [C-11] MADAM was rapidly metabolized. A possible metabolic pathway is the S-oxidation which could lead to SOMADAM and SO(2)MADAM. In vitro evaluation of these two potential metabolites has shown that SOMADAM exhibited a good affinity for SERT and a good selectivity for SERT over NET and DAT. Methods: Comparative PET imaging studies in non-human primate brain with [C-11]MADAM and [C-11] SOMADAM were carried out, and plasma samples were analyzed using reverse phase HPLC. We have explored the metabolism of [C-11]MADAM in rat brain with a view to understand its possible interference for brain imaging with PET. Results: PET imaging studies in non-human primate brain using [C-11]SOMADAM indicated that this tracer does not bind with high amounts to brain regions known to be rich in SERT. The fraction of [C-11]SOMADAM in nonhuman primate plasma was approximately 5% at 4 min and 1% at 15 min after [C-11]MADAM injection. HPLC analysis of brain sample after [C-11]MADAM injection to rats demonstrated that [C-11]SOMADAM was not detected in the brain. Conclusions: C-11]SOMADAM is not superior over [C-11]MADAM as a SERT PET radioligand. Nevertheless, [11C] SOMADAM has been identified as a minor labeled metabolite of [C-11]MADAM measured in monkey plasma. [C-11]SOMADAM was not detected in rat brain. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The assay enables rapid and accurate determination of insulin concentrations in experimental samples, such as from insulin-secreting cells. The principle of the method is based on the binding competition of insulin in a measured sample with a radiolabeled insulin for insulin receptor (IR) in IM-9 cells. Both key components, radiolabeled insulin and IM-9 cells, are commercially available. The IR binding assay was used to determine unknown amounts of insulin secreted by MIN6 beta cell line after stimulation with glucose, arginine, ornithine, dopamine, and serotonin. The experimental data obtained by the IR binding assay were compared to the results determined by RIA kits and both methods showed a very good agreement of results. We observed the stimulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion from MIN6 cells by arginine, weaker stimulation by ornithine, but inhibitory effects of dopamine. Serotonin effects were either stimulatory or inhibitory, depending on the concentration of serotonin used. The results will require further investigation. The study also clearly revealed advantages of the IR binding assay that allows the measuring of a higher throughput of measured samples, with a broader range of concentrations than in the case of RIA kits. The IR binding assay can provide an alternative to standard RIA and ELISA assays for the determination of insulin levels in experimental samples and can be especially useful in scientific laboratories studying insulin production and secretion by beta cells and searching for new modulators of insulin secretion.

Methods: A recently developed PBPK model for Lu-177-PSMA I&T RLT was extended to account for tumor (exponential) growth and reduction due to irradiation (linear quadratic model). Data from 13 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer were retrospectively analyzed. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic parameters were simultaneously fitted in a Bayesian framework to PET/CT activity concentrations, planar scintigraphy data, and tumor volumes before and after (6 wk) therapy. The method was validated using the leave-one-out Jackknife method. The tumor volume after therapy was predicted on the basis of pretherapy PET/CT imaging and PBPK/PD modeling. Results: The relative deviation of the predicted and measured tumor volume for PSMA-positive tumor cells (6 wk after therapy) was 1% +/- 40%, excluding 1 patient (prostate-specific antigen-negative) from the population. The radiosensitivity for the prostate-specific antigen-positive patients was determined to be 0.0172 +/- 0.0084 Gy(-1). Conclusion: To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first attempt to solely use PET/CT and modeling methods to predict the PSMA-positive tumor volume after RLT. Internal validation shows that this is feasible with an acceptable accuracy. Improvement of the method and external validation of the model is ongoing.

Dopamine β-Hydroxylase-Deficient Mice Have Normal Densities of D<sub>2</sub> Dopamine Receptors in the High-Affinity State Based on In Vivo PET Imaging and In Vitro Radioligand Binding	SYNAPSE			English	Article						[C-11]MNPA; D-2 dopamine receptor; high-affinity state; dopamine beta-hydroxylase; PET	AMPHETAMINE-SENSITIZED ANIMALS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; EX-VIVO; NOREPINEPHRINE; OCCUPANCY; BRAIN	In vitro, D-2 dopamine receptors (DAR) can exist in low- and high-affinity states for agonists and increases of D-2 receptors in high-affinity state have been proposed to underlie DA receptor supersensitivity in vivo. Deletion of the gene for dopamine p-hydroxylase (DBH) causes mice to become hypersensitive to the effects of psychostimulants, and in vitro radioligand binding results suggest an increased percentage of D-2 receptors in a high-affinity state. To determine whether DBH knockout mice display an increase of high-affinity state D-2 receptors in vivo, we scanned DBH knockout and control mice with the agonist PET radioligand [C-11]MNPA, which is thought to bind preferentially to the high-affinity state of the D-2 receptor. In addition, we performed in vitro binding experiments on striatal homogenates with [H-3]methylspiperone to measure B-max values and the percentages of high- and low-affinity states of the D-2 receptor. We found that the in vivo striatal binding of [C-11]MNPA was similar in DBH knockout mice and heterozygous controls and the in vitro B-max values and percentages of D-2 receptors in the high-affinity state, were not significantly different between these two groups. In summary, our results suggest that DBH knockout mice have normal levels of D-2 receptors in the high-affinity state and that additional mechanisms contribute to their behavioral sensitivity to psychostimulants.

Dual allosteric and orthosteric pharmacology of synthetic analog cannabidiol-dimethylheptyl, but not cannabidiol, on the cannabinoid CB2 receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cannabinoid CB 2 receptor; Allosteric modulation; Cannabidiol; Cannabidiol-dimethylheptyl; Radioligand binding assays; Signaling pathways	BETA-CARYOPHYLLENE; BINDING; DERIVATIVES; MODULATORS; AGONIST	Cannabinoid CB2 receptor (CB2R) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) involved in a broad spectrum of physiological processes and pathological conditions. For that reason, targeting CB2R might provide therapeutic opportunities in neurodegenerative disorders, neuropathic pain, inflammatory diseases, and cancer. The main components from Cannabis sativa, such as A9-tetrahydrocannabinol (A9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), have been therapeutically exploited and synthetically-derived analogs have been generated. One example is cannabidioldimethylheptyl (CBD-DMH), which exhibits anti-inflammatory effects. Nevertheless, its pharmacological mechanism of action is not yet fully understood and is hypothesized for multiple targets, including CB2R. The aim of this study was to further investigate the molecular pharmacology of CBD-DMH on CB2R while CBD was taken along as control. These compounds were screened in equilibrium and kinetic radioligand binding studies and various functional assays, including G protein activation, inhibition of cAMP production and 13-arrestin-2 recruitment. In dissociation studies, CBD-DMH allosterically modulated the radioligand binding. Furthermore, CBD-DMH negatively modulated the G protein activation of reference agonists CP55,940, AEA and 2-AG, but not the agonist-induced 13-arrestin-2 recruitment. Nevertheless, CBD-DMH also displayed competitive binding to CB2R and partial agonism on G protein activation, inhibition of cAMP production and 13-arrestin-2 recruitment. CBD did not exhibit such allosteric behavior and only very weakly bound CB2R without activation. This study shows a dual binding mode of CBD-DMH, but not CBD, to CB2R with the suggestion of two different binding sites. Altogether, it encourages further research into this dual mechanism which might provide a new class of molecules targeting CB2R.

The purpose of this study was to assess whether the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is a useful target for imaging and radioligand therapy of MCL, using a novel pair of radioligands, [Ga-68]Ga and [Lu-177]Lu-BL02. Experimental Design: We performed a retrospective analysis of 146 patients with MCL to evaluate CXCR4 expression and its correlation with outcomes. Guided by in silico methods, we designed BL02, a new radioligand labelled with Ga-68 or Lu-177 for PET imaging and therapy, respectively. We performed imaging and biodistribution studies in xenograft models with varying CXCR4 expression. We evaluated [Lu-177]Lu-BL02 in MCL models, and evaluated its potential for therapy in Z138 MCL xenografts. Results: Phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated CXCR4 expression were correlated with poor survival in patients with MCL and characterized by unique underlying molecular signatures. [Ga-68]Ga-BL02 uptake correlated with CXCR4 expression, and localized lesions in a metastatic xenograft model. [Lu-177]Lu-BL02 showed high uptake in MCL xenografts. Therapy studies with a single dose in the Z138 model showed tumor regression and improved survival compared with a control group. Upon regrowth, the treated mice experienced concurrent metastasis alongside localized xenograft regrowth, and recurrent lesions showed enhanced CXCR4 signaling. Conclusions: CXCR4 is an independent factor of poor prognosis for MCL and a promising target for imaging and radioligand therapy. [Ga-68]Ga-BL02 showed high contrast to visualize CXCR4-expressing xenografts for PET imaging and [Lu-177]Lu-BL02 induced rapid tumor regression in a preclinical model of MCL.

BZDs have some unwanted effects; therefore, the development of new BZD receptor agonists with better efficacy and fewer unwanted effects is one of the subjects of interest. In this study, based on the phar-macophore/receptor model of the BZD binding site of GABAA receptors, a series of new 2-substituted-5-(4-chloro-2-phenoxy)phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (6a-f) were designed. Energy minima conformers of the designed compounds and diazepam were well matched in conformational analysis and showed proper interaction with the BZD-binding site of the GABAA receptor model (alpha 1 beta 2 Upsilon 2) in docking studies. The designed compounds were synthesized in acceptable yield and evaluated for their in vitro affinity to the benzodiazepine receptor of rat brains by radioligand receptor binding assay. The results demonstrated that the affinities of most of the novel compounds were even higher than diazepam. The novel compound 6a with the best affinity in radioligand receptor binding assay (K-i=0.44 nM and IC50= 0.73 +/- 0.17 nM) had considerable hypnotic activity and weak anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects with no negative effect on memory in animal models. Flumazenil as a selective benzodiazepine receptor antagonist was able to prevent hypnotic and anticonvulsant effects of 6a indicating the role of BZD re-ceptors in these effects.

Two ligands with high sigma(2) receptor affinity and subtype selectivity were then radiolabeled with F-18 in good radiochemical yields and purities, and evaluated in rodents. In biodistribution studies in male ICR mice, radioligand [F-18]9, or 1-(4-(5,6-dimethoxyisoindolin-2-yl)butyl)-4-(2 [F-18] fluoroethoxy)-1H-indole, was found to display high brain uptake and high brain-to-blood ratio. Pretreatment of animals with the selective sigma(2) receptor ligand CM398 led to significant reductions in both brain uptake (29%-54%) and brain-to-blood ratio (60%-88%) of the radioligand in a dose-dependent manner, indicating high and saturable specific binding of [F-18]9 to sigma(2) receptors in the brain. Further, ex vivo autoradiography in male ICR mice demonstrated regionally heterogeneous specific binding of [F-18]9 in the brain that is consistent with the distribution pattern of sigma(2) receptors. Dynamic positron emission tomography imaging confirmed regionally distinct distribution and high levels of specific binding for [F-18]9 in the rat brain, along with appropriate tissue kinetics. Taken together, results from our current study indicated the novel radioligand [F-18]9 as the first highly specific and promising imaging agent for sigma(2) receptors in the brain.

[C-11] AZ10419369 and [C-11]P943 have been applied as radioligands in these studies. Both use carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) as radionuclide, which limits the application to PET centres that have an on-site cyclotron and radiochemistry facilities. In this paper we report the synthesis and initial evaluation of the first fluorine-18 PET radioligand to image 5-HT1B receptors in brain, [F-18]AZ10419096. Materials and methods: A boronate-precursor for [F-18]AZ10419096 was synthesized from an intermediate provided by AstraZeneca and was labeled with fluorine 18 using Cu-mediated radio-fluorination. [F-18] AZ10419096 was used in PET baseline and pretreatment measurements in nonhuman primates. PET data were analyzed using SRTM using the cerebellum as reference region. Blood samples for radio-metabolite analysis were collected during PET measurements. Results: Radio-fluorination gave [F-18]AZ10419096 in sufficient amounts and molar activity and with high radiochemical purity to be applied in PET measurements. In a baseline PET measurement [F-18]AZ10419096 showed a high brain uptake and regional distribution consistent with reported 5-HT1B receptor densities. In a pretreatment PET measurement, AR-A000002 (2.0 mg/kg) blocked the binding of [F-18]AZ10419096 to 5-HT1B receptors in occipital cortex by 80%, thereby demonstrating high specific binding.

Monovalent or divalent cations did not enhance the binding of [H-3] LY334370 to the cloned human 5-HT1F receptor. In the presence of MgCl2, the time to reach equilibrium was approximately 2 h, while in its absence equilibrium was reached in less than 1 h. [H-3] LY334370 had high affinity for the cloned human 5-HT1F receptor (K-d = 0.446 nM) and the 5-HT1F receptor in rat brain (K-d = 0.388 nM). The expression density of 5-HT1F receptors, as determined by binding to homogenates of cortical regions from rat, was low (B-max = 79.1 fmol/ mg protein). There was a statistically significant correlation between the apparent pK(i) for inhibition of [H-3] LY334370 binding and the pEC(50) for stimulation of [S-35] GTP gamma S binding to homogenates of cells expressing the cloned human 5- HT1F receptor. In addition, there was a statistically significant correlation between the apparent pK(i) for inhibition of [H-3] LY334370 binding to the cloned human 5-HT1F receptor and the pID(50) for inhibition of trigeminal nerve stimulated dural plasma protein extravasation in the guinea pig. The conclusion from these studies is that [H-3] LY334370 is a high affinity radioligand which can be used for the study of the 5-HT1F receptor in rat brain or in cells transformed with the human 5-HT1F receptor.

The goal of this study is to develop an optimal Evans blue-modified radiotherapeutic agent that could maximize the absolute tumor uptake and tumor absorbed dose thus the therapeutic efficacy to allow treatment of tumors even with moderate level of PSMA expression.Methods[Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 was synthesized based on PSMA-targeting agent and Evans blue. Binding affinity and PSMA targeting specificity were verified through cell uptake and competition binding assay in 22Rv1 tumor model that has moderate level of PSMA expression. SPECT/CT imaging and biodistribution studies in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice were performed to evaluate the preclinical pharmacokinetics. Radioligand therapy studies were conducted to systematically assess the therapeutic effect of [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003.ResultsLNC1003 showed high binding affinity (IC50 = 10.77 nM) to PSMA in vitro, which was comparable with that of PSMA-617 (IC50 = 27.49 nM) and EB-PSMA-617 (IC50 = 7.91 nM). SPECT imaging of [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 demonstrated significantly improved tumor uptake and retention as compared with [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, making it suitable for prostate cancer therapy. Biodistribution studies further confirmed the remarkably higher tumor uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 (138.87 +/- 26.53%ID/g) over [Lu-177]Lu-EB-PSMA-617 (29.89 +/- 8.86%ID/g) and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (4.28 +/- 0.25%ID/g) at 24 h post-injection. Targeted radioligand therapy results showed noteworthy inhibition of 22Rv1 tumor growth after administration of a single dose of 18.5 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003. There was no obvious antitumor effect after [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment under the same condition.ConclusionIn this study, [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 was successfully synthesized with high radiochemical purity and stability. High binding affinity and PSMA targeting specificity were identified in vitro and in vivo. With greatly enhanced tumor uptake and retention, [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 has the potential to improve therapeutic efficacy using significantly lower dosages and less cycles of Lu-177 that promises clinical translation to treat prostate cancer with various levels of PSMA expression.

We previously hypothesized that F-18-FCWAY, a radioligand for the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor, is a weak substrate for permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) based on its very early peak and rapid washout from human brain. To determine whether F-18-FCWAY is a substrate for P-gp, breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and multidrug resistance protein (MRP1) - the three most prevalent efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier - we performed three sets of experiments. In vitro, we conducted fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) flow cytometry studies in cells over-expressing P-gp, BCRP, and MRP1 treated with inhibitors specific to each transporter and with FCWAY. Ex vivo, we measured F-18-FCWAY concentration in plasma and brain homogenate of transporter knockout mice using gamma-counter and radio-HPLC. In vivo, we conducted positron emission tomography (PET) studies to assess changes in humans who received F-18-FCWAY during an infusion of tariquidar (2-4mg/kg iv), a potent and selective P-gp inhibitor. In vitro studies showed that FCWAY allowed fluorescent substrates to get into the cell by competitive inhibition of all three transporters at the cell membrane. Ex vivo measurements in knockout mice indicate that F-18-FCWAY is a substrate only for P-gp and not BCRP. In vivo, tariquidar increased F-18-FCWAY brain uptake in seven of eight subjects by 60-100% compared to each person's baseline. Tariquidar did not increase brain uptake via some peripheral mechanism, given that it did not significantly alter concentrations in plasma of the parent radioligand F-18-FCWAY or its brain-penetrant radiometabolite F-18-FC. These results show that F-18-FCWAY is a weak substrate for efflux transport at the blood-brain barrier; some radioligand can enter brain, but its removal is hastened by P-gp. Although F-18-FCWAY is not ideal for measuring 5-HT1A receptors, it demonstrates that weak substrate radioligands can be useful for measuring both increased and decreased function of efflux transporters, which is not possible with currently available radioligands such as C-11-loperamide and C-11-verapamil that are avid substrates for transporters.

Response to RLT was evaluated based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes and imaging response. Clinical progression-free survival and overall survival were used to report oncological outcomes. Toxicity was assessed using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events criteria.Results: In mCRPC, 22 (69%), 18 (56%), and 11 (34%) patients achieved any PSA decline, PSA response of >= 30%, and PSA response of >= 50%, respectively. The clinical progression-free survival and overall survival after the first cycle of RLT were 6.3 and 21.4 months, respectively. In mHSPC, Lu-177-PSMA-I&T RLT resulted in excellent PSA response (93.0%-99.9%) in all cases. Clinical progression and cancer-related mortality occurred in only 1 case. Toxicity profile was favorable in both mHSPC and mCRPC.Conclusions Lu-177-PSMA-I&T RLT demonstrated favorable PSA response (>= 30%) in over half of the patients with mCRPC and excellent PSA response in all patients with mHSPC. Toxicity profile was favorable in both mHSPC and mCRPC settings. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T RLT in the management of metastatic prostate cancer.

A positron emission tomography study in healthy volunteers to estimate mGluR5 receptor occupancy of AZD2066-Estimating occupancy in the absence of a reference region	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Nonlinear mixed effects modelling; Positron emission tomography; Receptor occupancy; [C-11]-ABP688; mGluR5 receptor	IN-VIVO; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; C-11 FLUMAZENIL; ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE; PET; BINDING; AFFINITY; RADIOLIGAND; VITRO; C-11-ABP688	AZD2066 is a new chemical entity pharmacologically characterized as a selective, negative allosteric modulator of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5). Antagonism of mGluR5 has been implicated in relation to various diseases such as anxiety, depression, and pain disorders. To support translation from preclinical results and previous experiences with this target in man, a positron emission tomography study was performed to estimate the relationship between AZD2066 plasma concentrations and receptor occupancy in the human brain, using the mGluR5 radioligand [C-11]-ABP688. The study involved PET scans on 4 occasions in 6 healthy volunteers. The radioligand was given as a tracer dose alone and following oral treatment with different doses of AZD2066. The analysis was based on the total volume of distribution derived fro m each PET-assessment. A non-linear mixed effects model was developed where ten delineated brain regions of interest from all PET scans were included in one simultaneous fit. For comparison the analysis was also performed according to a method described previously by Lassen et al. (1995). The results of the analysis showed that the total volume of distribution decreased with increasing drug concentrations in all regions with an estimated Kipl of 1170 nM. Variability between individuals and occasions in non-displaceable volume of distribution could explain most of the variability in the total volume of distribution. The Lassen approach provided a similar estimate for Kipl, but the variability was exaggerated and difficult to interpret. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Radioligand-receptor binding studies using [H-3]5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid demonstrated a "down-regulation" of the glycine site/NMDA receptor following chronic treatment with antidepressants and electroconvulsive shock. However, binding procedure using this radioligand is time consuming because it requires the use of centrifugation method in the separation process. The introduction of a new radioligand of glycine/NMDA receptor, [H-3]L-689,560 enables the application of a rapid filtration method. In the present study we demonstrate that 2-week treatment with imipramine (15 mg/kg ip) did not evoke alterations in specific [H-3]L-689,560 binding and in IC50 value of glycine in displacing [H-3]L-689,560 binding in the mouse or rat cortex. However, longer, a 4-week treatment with imipramine induced a significant 71% increase in IC50 value of glycine in displacing [H-3]L-689,560 binding in the mouse cortex. Moreover, the presence of zinc in the incubation media, dose-dependently enhances detection of imipramine-induced increase in IC50 value of glycine in displacing [H-3]L-689,560 binding in the rat cortex. The present data indicate that: (1) [H-3]L-689,560 may,be a suitable ligand for assessing adaptation of the glycine/NMDA sites and (2) the presence of zinc enhances detection of imipramine-induced reduction of glycine affinity for glycine/NMDA receptors labeled with [H-3]L-689,560 which further indicates a significance of zinc in the mechanism of antidepressant treatment.

The recent VISION trial is the first to demonstrate a survival benefit of Lutetium-177[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in post-chemotherapy mCRPC. This journal club reviews the VISION trial in the context of the earlier TheraP trial of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in mCRPC post docetaxel and androgen pathway inhibition, to provide direction for the real-world application of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Treatment in the control groups differed significantly between both trials and may have influenced outcomes: TheraP mandated cabazitaxel whereas VISION's design could not allow it. In both trials, [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 had a good safety profile, with common adverse events being fatigue, nausea, dry mouth, marrow suppression and diarrhea. Given its efficacy and favorable safety even in heavily pre-treated patients, [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 provides hope to mCRPC patients and may be applied to earlier disease stages in future investigations.

In this study, we describe the synthesis, radiolabeling and in vivo evaluation of [C-11]E-55888 as a radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. [C-11]E-55888 was obtained by N-methylation of an appropriate precursor using [C-11]MeOTf in acetone at 60 degrees C giving isolated quantities in the range of 1.7-2.4 GBq. Studies in Danish Landrace pigs demonstrated that [C-11]E-55888 has good brain uptake, however, the distribution in the brain tissue was dominated by non-specific binding, as binding could neither be displaced by the structurally different 5-HT7 receptor ligand SB-269970 nor by self-block with unlabeled E-55888. Based on these data, [C-11]E-55888 does not show promise as a PET radioligand for imaging the 5-HT7 receptor in vivo. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Heinz, A				Heinz, A			Dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. New findings support a traditional theory	NERVENARZT			German	Article						synaptic dopamine concentration; phasic dopamine release; SPECT; IBZM; AMPT	POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY; PET; AMPHETAMINE; RELEASE; LIGAND; SPECT; MODEL; BRAIN	The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the neuroleptical blockade of central dopamine D-2 receptors. Brain imaging studies, however, generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central D-2 receptors among schizophrenic patients. Using a novel approach,the group of Laruelle and Abi-Dargham was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum. Endogenous dopamine competes with a radioligand for binding at dopamine D-2 receptors; compared to healthy control subjects, blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic-naive schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in D-2 binding of the infused radioligand,indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine. A similar increase in D-2 binding was also observed in drug-free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics;these patients also showed an increased density of striatal D-2 receptors, most likely due to counteradaptive upregulation of D-2 receptors during neuroleptic medication. The Columbia study provides an important indication of hyper-dopaminergic function in schizophrenia.

This standard treatment scheme has proved safe and effective resulting in objective response in most patients with no significant toxicity. Many patients, however, show high-volume residual tumor burden after the sixth cycle and may benefit from treatment continuation. Extended treatment with additional cycles has been withheld due to concerns on potential increased toxicity.MethodsTwenty-six patients with high-volume residual tumor burden (according to CHAARTED) after standard RLT with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and no alternative treatment option received additional RLT cycles reaching a median of 10 (range 7-16) cycles with a mean activity of 7.4 +/- 0.9 GBq per cycle. Response assessment with [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was done every 2-3 cycles or if disease progression was clinically suspected or based on change in PSA value (according to the PCWG3 criteria). Toxicity was measured using routine blood work up including blood counts, liver and renal function, and was graded according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria. Survival outcome was calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier method.ResultsFurther PSA decline of 33 +/- 28% during the extended treatment was observed in 21/26 (81%) patients, whereas 5/26 (19%) patients showed a PSA increase; correspondingly in 11/21 patients with an initial response (PR or SD) to extended cycles, treatment was discontinued due to progressive disease, whereas six (23%) patients achieved low-volume residual disease. Two (8%) patients died without showing progression, and two (8%) patients are still under therapy. The median progression-free survival was 19 (95% CI: 15-23) months, and the overall survival was 29 (95% CI: 18-40) months. Grade >= 3 hematological toxicities occurred in 4/26 (15%) patients during treatment extension, and nephrotoxicity (grade >= 3) was observed in 1/26 (4%) patient during the follow-up.ConclusionExtended radioligand therapy is a feasible treatment option in patients with high-volume residual tumor after the completion of standard treatment with six cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Improved survival and the acceptable safety profile warrant further investigation of the concept of additional cycles in selected patients.

Fibroblast Activation Protein-Targeted Radioligand Therapy for Treatment of Solid Tumors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						radioligand therapy; FAP; albumin binder; scRNA-seq; cancer-associated fibroblasts	ALBUMIN-BINDER	Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has received increasing attention as an oncologic target because of its prominent expression in solid tumors but virtual absence from healthy tissues. Most radioligand therapies (RLTs) targeting FAP, however, suffer from inadequate tumor retention or clearance from healthy tissues. Herein we report a FAP-targeted RLT comprising an FAP6 ligand conjugated to DOTA and an albumin binder (4-p-iodophenylbutyric acid, or IP) for enhanced pharmacokinetics. We evaluated the performance of the resulting FAP6-IP-DOTA conjugate in 4 tumor models, 3 of which express FAP only on cancer-associated fibroblasts, that is, analo-gously to human tumors. Methods: Single-cell RNA-sequencing data were analyzed from 34 human breast, ovarian, colorectal, and lung cancers to quantify FAP-overexpressing cells. FAP6-DOTA conju-gates were synthesized with or without an albumin binder (IP) and investigated for binding to human FAP-expressing cells. Accumulation of 111In-or 177Lu-labeled conjugates in KB, HT29, U87MG, and 4T1 murine tumors was also assessed by radioimaging or biodistribution analyses. Radiotherapeutic potency was quantitated by measuring tumor volumes versus time. Results: Approximately 5% of all cells in human tumors overexpressed FAP (cancer-associated fibroblasts comprised-77% of this FAP-positive subpopulation, whereas-2% were cancer cells). FAP6 conjugates bound to FAP-expressing cells with high affinity (dissociation constant,-1 nM). 177Lu-FAP6-IP-DOTA achieved an 88-fold higher tumor dose than 177Lu-FAP6-DOTA and improved all tumor-to-healthy-organ ratios. Single doses of 177Lu-FAP6-IP-DOTA suppressed tumor growth by about 45% in all tested tumor models without causing reproducible toxicities. Conclusion: We conclude that 177Lu-FAP6-IP-DOTA constitutes a promising can-didate for FAP-targeted RLT of solid tumors.

A two-step one-pot radiosynthesis of the potent dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> agonist PET radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MNPA	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						PET; MNPA; dopamine D-2/D-3 agonist; radiosynthesis; LC-MS/MS analysis	ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; RECEPTOR AGONIST; RADIOTRACER; ANTAGONIST; BINDING; MNPA	(R)-(-)-2-[C-11]Methoxy-N-n-propylnorapomorphine ([C-11]MNPA ([C-11]2)) is an agonist radioligand of interest for imaging D-2/D-3 receptors in vivo. Here we sought to develop an improved radiosynthesis of this radioligand. Reference 2 was synthesized in nine steps with an overall yield of about 5%, starting from codeine. Trimethylsilyldiazomethane proved to be a practical improvement in comparison to diazomethane in the penultimate methylation step. A protected precursor for radiolabeling ((R)-(-)-2-hydroxy-10,11-acetonide-N-n-propylnoraporphine, 4) was prepared from (R)-(-)-2-hydroxy-N-n-propylnorapomorphine (1) in 30% yield. [C-11]2 was prepared from 4 via a two-step one-pot radiosynthesis. The first step, methylation of 4 with [C-11]methyl triflate, occurred in quantitative radiochemical yield. The second step, deprotection of the catechol moiety with HCl and heat, yielded 60-90% of [C-11]2 giving an overall incorporation yield from [C-11]methyl triflate of 60-90%. In a typical run more than 1 GBq of [C-11]2, was produced from carbon-11 generated from a 10-min proton irradiation (16MeV; 35 mu A) of nitrogen-hydrogen target gas. The radiochemical purity of [C-11]2 was > 99% and specific radioactivity at the time of injection was 901 +/- 342 GBq/mu mol (n = 10). The total synthesis time was 35-38 min from the end of radionuclide production. The identity of [C-11]2 was confirmed by comparing its LC-MS/MS spectrum with those of reference 2 and (R)-(-)-10-methoxy-2,11-dihydroxy-N-n-propylnoraporphine.	[Steiger, C.; Finnema, S.

The dopamine D-2 receptor exists in a high (D-2(high)) and a low-affinity state for dopamine. Under physiological conditions, dopamine is expected to bind to D-2(high) only. [C-11]-(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine ((+)-PHNO) is the first D-2/3 agonist radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in humans. Since [C-11]-(+)-PHNO is expected to bind preferentially to D2 high, it should be particularly vulnerable to competition with endogenous dopamine. Nine healthy subjects participated in two PET scans, one after administration of d-amphetamine and one after placebo. [C-11]-(+)- PHNO PET test re-test variability was determined in 11 healthy subjects. Binding potentials (BPs) were calculated for caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, and globus pallidus. d-Amphetamine led to a significant decrease of [C-11]-(+)- PHNO BPs in caudate (-13.2%), putamen (-20.8%), and ventral striatum (-24.9%), but not in globus pallidus (-6.5%). d-Amphetamine-induced displacement correlated with serum d-amphetamine levels in all regions but caudate. This is the first report on competition between endogenous dopamine and a D-2/3 agonist radioligand in humans. [C-11]-(+)-PHNO PET might be a superior measure for release of endogenous dopamine than PET employing conventional D-2/3 antagonist radioligands.

Moving toward antagonist-based CCK2R-radioligands instead, we herein present three analogs of the nonpeptidic CCK2R-antagonist Z360, GAS1/2/3. Each was conjugated to a different chelator (DOTA, NODAGA or DOTAGA) for labeling with medically relevant trivalent radiometals (e.g., Ga-68, In-111, Lu-177) for potential use as anti-CCK2R cancer agents; (2) Methods: The in vitro properties of the thee analogs were compared in stably transfected HEK293-CCK2R cells. Biodistribution profiles were compared in SCID mice bearing twin HEK293-CCK2R and wtHEK293 tumors; (3) Results: The GAS1/2/3 analogs displayed high CCK2R-affinity (lower nM-range). The radioligands were fairly stable in vivo and selectively targeted the HEK293-CCK2R, but not the CCK2R-negative wtHEK293 tumors in mice. Their overall pharmacokinetic profile was found strongly dependent on the radiometal-chelate. Results could be visualized by SPECT/CT for the [In-111]In-analogs; (4) Conclusions: The present study highlighted the high impact of the radiometal-chelate on the end-pharmacokinetics of a new series of Z360-based radioligands, revealing candidates with promising properties for clinical translation. It also provided the impetus for the development of a new class of nonpeptidic radioligands for CCK2R-targeted theranostics of human cancer.

Though high radiation doses can be delivered to the tumors, complete remission is still rare. Radiosensitization prior to PRRT is therefore considered to be a promising strategy to improve the treatment effect. In this study, effect and mechanism of mTOR inhibitors were investigated in a comprehensive panel of five NEN cell lines (BON, QGP-1, LCC-18, H727, UMC-11), employing assays for cellular proliferation, clonogenic survival, cell cycle modification and signaling. mTOR inhibition lead to growth arrest with a biphasic concentration-response pattern: a partial response at approximately 1 nM and full response at micromolar concentrations (8-48 mu M). All cell lines demonstrated elevated p70S6K phosphorylation yet also increased phosphorylation of counterregulatory Akt. The pulmonary NEN cell line UMC-11 showed the lowest induction of phospho-Akt and strongest growth arrest by mTOR inhibitors. Radiation sensitivity of the cells (50% reduction versus control) was found to range between 4 and 8 Gy. Further, mTOR inhibition was employed together with irradiation to evaluate radiosensitizing effects of this combination treatment. mTOR inhibition was found to radiosensitize all five NEN cells in an additive manner with a moderate overall effect. The radiation-induced G2/M arrest was diminished under combination treatment, leading to an increased G1 arrest. Further investigation involving a suitable animal model as well as radioligand application such as Lu-177-DOTATATE or Lu-177-DOTATOC will have to demonstrate the full potential of this strategy for radiosensitization in NEN.

The success of using theranostic pairs in neuroendocrine neoplasms has paved the way for the development of targeted diagnosis and therapy in other tumors. Results. Molecular imaging of prostate cancer using PET/CT with Ga-68 labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) small molecules and molecular radiotherapy applying PSMA-mediated radioligand therapy (PRLT) with Lu-177 labeled PSMA is the next major milestone in personalized nuclear medicine. Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT enables very accurate detection of prostate cancer and of very small metastases with high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity and provides quantitative, reproducible data that can be used for selecting patients for PRLT and for evaluation of the response to therapy in the sense of precision medicine. Conclusion. PRLT using Lu-177 PSMA small molecules seems to be very effective for the treatment of metastasized, castrate-resistant progressive prostate cancer (mCRPC) even in very advanced cases as shown in different nuclear medicine treatment centers in Germany since early 2013. In addition, significant improvement in clinical symptoms and excellent palliation can be achieved with low or minimal toxicity. Further prospective randomized clinical trials for head-to-head comparison with other established treatment modalities (e.g., abiraterone, enzalutamide, docetaxel) are warranted for an unbiased evaluation of progression-free and overall survival data and to consider PRLT earlier in the management of mCRPC. Further improvements are possible by using targeted alpha radiation therapy (bismuth-213 or actinium-225 labelled PSMA) or by combining PRLT with novel androgen deprivation therapies or with radiosensitizers.

J	Karlsson, JG; Karlsson, B; Andersson, LI; Nicholls, IA				Karlsson, JG; Karlsson, B; Andersson, LI; Nicholls, IA			The roles of template complexation and ligand binding conditions on recognition in bupivacaine molecularly imprinted polymers	ANALYST			English	Article							SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; LOCAL-ANESTHETICS; SELECTIVITY; SITES; NMR	A model for the molecular basis for ligand recognition in bupivacaine imprinted methacrylic acid - ethylene glycol dimethacrylate co-polymers has been developed based upon a series of H-1-NMR studies in conjunction with HPLC and radioligand binding analyses. H-1-NMR studies indicated that functional monomer-template complexes survive the polymerisation process, at least up until the stage of gelation. Polymers were synthesised and characterised by surface area analysis (BET), FT-IR and SEM. A combination of zonal and frontal chromatographic studies in aqueous and non-polar media indicate that selectivity arises from a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. However, in the concentration regime employed for LC-based studies, ligand recognition in aqueous media was shown to be predominantly non-specific and hydrophobic in character. Radioligand binding studies, in lower ligand binding concentration regimes, permitted closer examination of the higher affinity binding sites. It was shown that the presence of a polar modifier in a non-polar solvent, or an organic modifier in water, produced enhanced selectivity. Variable temperature studies showed that the temperature of binding influences selectivity as well as the apparent number of sites available and that this effect is different in organic and aqueous environments. This indicates that the system studied is more complex in character than is generally appreciated. A comparison of the techniques employed here indicates that although chromatographic studies provide a valuable first-round screen for polymer - ligand selectivities, the level of detail obtainable using radioligand binding studies ( lower concentrations and true equilibrium binding) makes them superior for detailed evaluations of molecularly imprinted polymers.

ATP-sensitive K+ channels (K-ATP channels) are complexes of inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir6.x) and sulphonylurea receptors (SURs). Kir6.2-containing channels are closed by ATP binding to Kir6.2, and opened by MgADP binding to SUR. Channel activity is modulated by synthetic compounds such as the channel-blocking sulphonylureas and the K-ATP channel openers, which both act by binding to SUR. By interacting with Kir6.2, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP,) and oleoyl-coenzyme A (OCoA) decrease the ATP-sensitivity of the channel and abolish the effect of the synthetic channel modulators. Here, we have investigated whether lipids and related compounds interfered with the binding of the sulphonylurea, glibenclamide (GBC) and of the opener, N-cyano-N'-(1,1-dimethylpropyl)-N"-3-pyridylguanidine (P1075), to the SUR subtypes. 2 Lipids (100-300 mu m) inhibited binding of [H-3]GBC and [H-3]P1075 to SUR subtypes in the rank order OCoA > dioleylglycerol-succinyl-nitriloacetic acid (DOGS-NTA)> oleate > malonyl-CoA > PIP2. 3 OCoA inhibited radioligand binding to SUR completely, with IC50 values ranging from 6 to 44 mu m. Inhibition was reversed by increasing the concentration of the radioligands in agreement with an essentially competitive mechanism. MgATP and coexpression with Kir6.2 decreased the potency of OCoA. 4 DOGS-NTA inhibited radioligand binding to SUR by 40-88 %, with IC50 values ranging from 38 to 120 mu m. 5 Poly-lysine increased radioligand binding to SUR by up to 30 % but did not affect much the inhibition of ligand binding by OCoA and DOGS-NTA. 6 Radioligand binding to SUR2A but not to the other SUR subtypes was slightly (10-20 %) stimulated by lipids at concentrations similar to 10 x lower than required for inhibition. 7 The data show that certain lipids, at high concentrations, interact with SUR and inhibit the binding of GBC and P1075; with SUR2A, a modest stimulation of ligand binding precedes inhibition. Regarding K-ATP channel activity, these effects will be overruled by the interaction of the lipids with Kir6.2 at lower (physiological) concentrations. They are, however, of pharmacological importance and must be taken into account if high concentrations of these compounds (e.g. OCoA > 10 mu M) are used to interfere with the action of sulphonylureas and openers on K-ATP channel activity.

Method: Striatal samples were retrieved at autopsy; immunoblot assays were then performed by using a highly specific VMAT2 antibody. Striatal radioligand binding to VMAT2 was assessed with dihydrotetrabenazine ([H-3]DTBZ) and dopamine levels employing high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Cocaine users displayed a marked reduction in VMAT2 immunoreactivity as well as reduced [H-3]DTBZ binding and dopamine levels. it did not appear that the reduction in VMAT2 immunoreactivity was related to ethanol use, but dopamine levels were lower in subjects with only ethanol diagnoses. Subjects suffering from cocaine-induced mood disorders displayed a greater loss of VMAT2 immunoreactivity that approached significance. Conclusions: Human cocaine users lose VMAT2 protein, which might reflect damage to striatal dopamine fibers. These neuronal changes could play a role in causing disordered mood and motivational processes in more severely dependent patients.

These 5-alkyloxy-4-amino-2(5H)-furanones were screened in a I-[125]-CCK-8 radioligand receptor binding assay for CCK2 affinity and novel active ligands in the nanomolar range were identified. SAR was optimized leading to the cyclohexyl derivative 25 with an IC50 of 27 nM. Furanone 18 was obtained as a stable crystalline material with an IC50 of 85 nM, but had a higher CCK2 selectivity. It was subsequently tested in the isolated guinea pig ileum assay with sulfated CCK8, and the CCK antagonizing properties of the ligand were confirmed. The CCK2 selective antagonist 18 was found to potentiate analgesia in the tail flick assay in mice, for the strong opiate morphine, the partial opiate agonist tramadol and the tricyclic antidepressant desimipramine.

A New Radioligand Binding Assay to Measure the Concentration of Drugs in Rodent Brain Ex Vivo	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							RECEPTOR DESENSITIZING AGENT; PARTIAL AGONISTS VARENICLINE; SAZETIDINE-A; NICOTINE	We have developed a new radioligand binding assay method to measure the concentration of nonradiolabeled drugs in the brain ex vivo. This new method fuses the concepts of standard competition and saturation binding assays and uses a transformed version of the Cheng-Prusoff equation (Biochem Pharmacol 22:3099-3108, 1973) to calculate the drug concentration. After testing the validity of this method, we demonstrated its utility by measuring the brain concentration of sazetidine-A, a newly developed nicotinic receptor ligand, and its elimination rate after a single subcutaneous administration. Our results indicate that sazetidine-A reaches brain concentrations that are known to occupy and desensitize the majority of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding sites. Furthermore, using this method, we estimated the half-life of sazetidine-A in the rat brain to be similar to 65 min. It is important to note that the method described here to measure sazetidine-A in brain should be generalizable to other drugs acting at any receptor that can be reliably measured with a radiolabeled ligand.

A method was developed starting from elemental n.c.a. selenium-75, followed by a three-step polymer-supported radioselenation and deprotection which gave the radioligand with a radiochemical yield of 30%, a radiochemical purity of > 99% and a specific radioactivity of > 300 GBq/mmol (8 Ci/ mmol). Preparation time was 40 min. The nonradioactive compound 5'-(methylseleno)-N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (1) was, pharmacologically evaluated in vitro and showed high affinity and selectivity for the adenosine-A(1) receptor. These preliminary results suggest that this compound could be a useful radioligand for the noninvasive imaging of the brain adenosine-A(1) receptors using positron emission tomography (PET) when labelled with the positron emitter selenium-73 (half-life: 7.1 h).

The [F-18]fluoropropyl derivative of GSK1482160, [F-18]IUR-1602, has been first prepared and examined as a new potential P2X7R radioligand. The reference standard IUR-1602 was synthesized from tert-butyl (S)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylate, fluoropropylbromide, and 2-chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzylamine with overall chemical yield 13% in three steps. The target tracer [F-18]IUR-1602 was synthesized from desmethyl-GSK1482160 with 3-[F-18]fluoropropyl tosylate, prepared from propane-1,3-diyl bis(4-methylbenzenesulfonate) and K[F-18]F/Kryptofix2.2.2, in two steps and isolated by HPLC combined with SPE in 2-7% decay corrected radiochemical yield. The radiochemical purity was > 99%, and the molar activity at end of bombardment (EOB) was 74-370 GBq/mu mol. The potency of IUR-1602 in comparison with GSK1482160 was determined by a radioligand competitive binding assay using [C-11]GSK1482160, and the binding affinity K-i values for IUR-1602 and GSK1482160 are 23.6 and 3.07 nM, respectively. The initial in vitro evaluation results, 8-fold less potency of [F-18]IUR-1602 compared to [C-11]GSK1482160, prevent further in vivo evaluation of [F-18]IUR-1602 in animals and human.

Cannabinoid receptor expression in the bladder is altered in detrusor overactivity	INTERNATIONAL UROGYNECOLOGY JOURNAL			English	Article						Cannabinoids; Cholinergic nerves; Detrusor overactivity; Urinary bladder; Immunofluorescence; Radioligand binding	MOUSE URINARY-BLADDER; CB1 RECEPTORS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RAT BLADDER; BRAIN; INFLAMMATION; DYSFUNCTION; ACTIVATION; CELLS	Immunohistochemical (IHC) evidence shows that cannabinoid receptors (CB) are expressed in human bladders and cannabinoid agonists are known to inhibit detrusor contractility. However, the mechanism for this inhibition remains unknown. In addition, the role of CB in detrusor overactivity (DO) is under-investigated. The aim of this study was to compare CB expression in normal and DO human bladders and to further characterise these receptors. Polymer chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect differences in CB transcripts in bladder samples. Differences in CB protein expression was assessed by IHC. Immunofluorescence (IF) was used to evaluate co-localisation of CB with nerve fibres. Receptor density and binding affinity were measured using the cannabinoid radioligand [H-3]-CP-55,940. There were higher levels of CB1 transcripts in the urothelium of patients with DO and lower levels in the detrusor, compared with normal bladders. Radioligand binding revealed CB density of 421 +/- 104 fmol/mg protein in normal human bladders. IHC confirmed these findings at the protein level. IF staining demonstrated co-localisation of CB1 with choline acetyltransferase-(ChAT)-positive nerves in the detrusor and co-localisation with PGP9.5 in both urothelium and detrusor. CB2 was co-localised with both ChAT and PGP9.5 in the urothelium and the detrusor. Cannabinoid receptor expression is reduced in the detrusor of patients with DO, which may play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease. Co-localisation of CB receptors with cholinergic nerves may suggest that CB1, being localised on pre- and postsynaptic terminals, could influence neurotransmitter release. Our findings suggest the potential role of cannabinoid agonists in overactive bladder pharmacotherapy.

Low concentrations of ethanol do not affect radioligand binding to the δ-subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the rat brain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						GABA(A) receptors; delta subunit; immunoprecipitation; Western blot; co-localization; radioligand binding	GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; TYROSINE KINASE PHOSPHORYLATION; CULTURED CORTICAL-NEURONS; A RECEPTORS; EXTRASYNAPTIC RECEPTORS; GRANULE CELLS; CEREBELLUM; SUBTYPES; GAMMA(2)-SUBUNITS; BETA(2)-SUBUNITS	In the present study, we investigated the co-localization pattern of the delta subunit with other subunits of GABA(A) receptors in the rat brain using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting techniques. Furthermore, we investigated whether low concentrations of ethanol affect the delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor assemblies in the rat brain using radioligand binding to the rat brain membrane homogenates as well as to the immunoprecipitated receptor assemblies. Our results revealed that delta subunit is not co-localized with gamma(2) subunit but it is associated with the alpha(1) alpha(4) or alpha(6), beta(2) and/or beta(3) subunit(s) of GABA(A) receptors in the rat brain. Ethanol (1-50 mM) neither affected [H-3]muscimol (3 nM) binding nor diazepam-insensitive [H-3]Ro 15-4513 (2 nM) binding in the rat cerebellum and cerebral cortex membranes. However, a higher concentration of ethanol (500 mM) inhibited the binding of these radioligands to the GABA(A) receptors partially in the rat cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Similarly, ethanol (up to 50 mM) did not affect [H-3]muscimol (15 nM) binding to the immunoprecipitated delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor assemblies in the rat cerebellum and hippocampus but it inhibited the binding partially at a higher concentration (500 mM). These results suggest that the native delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors do not play a major role in the pharmacology of clinically relevant low concentrations of ethanol.

Quantification of serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in monkey brain with [<SUP>11</SUP>C](<i>R</i>)-(-)-RWAY	SYNAPSE			English	Article						serotonin 5-HT1A; [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY; kinetic analysis; P-glycoprotein; PET	MEDIATED MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; IN-VIVO; BINDING; PET; RADIOLIGAND; MODEL; TOMOGRAPHY; REVERSAL; BARRIER	[C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY ([C-11]2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-hexahydro-1{4-[1[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazinyl]]-2-phenylbutyry}-1H-azepine) is a new radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT1A receptors with positron emission tomography. In [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY, the direction of the amide bond is expected to reduce metabolism by hydrolysis while allowing easy C-11-labeling at the methoxy position. The purposes of this study were to evaluate different tracer kinetic models in nonhuman primates to quantify 5-HT1A receptors with [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY and to test for the possible action of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), one of the known efflux pumps at the blood-brain barrier. The brain uptake of radioactivity from [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY into 5-HT1A receptor-rich brain regions was severalfold greater than for its antipode ([C-11](S)-(+)-RWAY) and could be displaced by receptor saturating doses of the selective 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY-100635. Pretreatment with tariquidar, a potent inhibitor of P-gp, increased brain uptake of [C-11])-(-)-RWAY about 1.5-fold and the plasma free fraction about 1.8-fold. Thus, the effect of tariquidar on brain uptake may have been caused by displacement of the radioligand binding to plasma proteins. Mathematical modeling showed that the estimated values of regional binding potential were correlated strongly between two-tissue compartment model and multilinear reference tissue model, and thus, supported the use of the cerebellum as a reference region.

Rolipram significantly decreased in Vivo H-3-SCH 23390 (dopamine D-1 selective radioligand) binding in the mouse striatum in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo saturation experiments together with the kinetic analysis of H-3-SCH 23390 binding revealed that the apparent association rate constant (k(on)) for H-3-SCH 23390 binding rather than the maximum number of binding sites available (B-max) was decreased by rolipram. H-3-N-methylspiperone (NMSP, dopamine D-2 selective radioligand) binding in the mouse striatum was also decreased by rolipram whereas no significant changes in H-3-raclopride (dopamine D-2 selective radioligand) binding were observed. As H-3-raclopride binding has been reported to be much more sensitive than H-3-NMSP binding to competition by endogenous dopamine, the decreases in H-3-SCH 23390 and H-3-NMSP binding cannot be attributed to competitive inhibition by endogenous dopamine. These results indicate that changes in second messenger cAMP concentrations may affect the apparent bimolecular association rate constant (k(on)) of dopamine receptor binding in intact brain. This may be mediated by changes in the receptor micro-environment and altered actual free ligand concentration surrounding the receptors.

We investigated whether PET tracers used clinically for studying brain function are affected by P-gp. Methods: Modulation of 8 radio-ligands by P-gp was assayed in mice by evaluating the effect of treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) on uptake into the brain (assay 1) and the effect of treatment with a cold ligand of the corresponding radioligand on uptake of C-11-verapamil, a representative radioligand for P-gp (assay 2). Brain-to-blood ratios were also examined as the other index to correct the delivery of radioligands. The radioligands investigated were C-11-TMSX (adenosine A(2A) receptor), C-11-MPDX (adenosine A, receptor), C-11-PK11195 (peripheral benzodiazepine receptor), C-11-flumenil (central benzodiazepine receptor), C-11-raclopride (dopamine D-2-like receptor), C-11-pyrilamine (histamine H-1 receptor), C-11-PIB (amyloid plaque), and C-11-donepezil (acetylcholine esterase). Results: In assay 1, CsA treatment increased both the uptake and the brain-to-blood ratio of C-11-TMSX, C-11-MPDX C-11-flumazenil, and C-11-donepezil among the 8 raclioligands. In assay 2, in which 4 cold ligands were examined, cold verapamil slightly increased the brain-to-blood ratio of C-11-verapamil, but TMSX, MPDX, and MPPF did not increase either parameter. Conclusion: Assay 1 was suitable for evaluating the P-gp modulation of radioligands. Among the 8 radioligands investigated, C-11-TMSX, C-11-MPDX, C-11-flumazenil, and C-11-donepezil were modulated by P-gp.

The resulting three groups are homozygous for high-affinity state (HH), homozygous for low-affinity state (LL), or heterozygous (HL). We tested if in vitro binding to leukocytes distinguished TSPO genotypes and if genotype could affect clinical studies using the TSPO radioligand [C-11]PBR28. In vitro binding to leukocytes and [C-11]PBR28 brain imaging were performed in 27 human subjects with known TSPO genotype. Specific [H-3]PBR28 binding was measured in prefrontal cortex of 45 schizophrenia patients and 47 controls. Leukocyte binding to PBR28 predicted genotype in all subjects. Brain uptake was similar to 40% higher in HH than HL subjects. Specific [H-3]PBR28 binding in LL controls was negligible, while HH controls had similar to 80% higher binding than HL controls. After excluding LL subjects, specific binding was 16% greater in schizophrenia patients than controls. This difference was insignificant by itself (P=0.085), but was significant after correcting for TSPO genotype (P=0.011). Our results show that TSPO genotype influences PBR28 binding in vitro and in vivo. Correcting for this genotype increased statistical power in our postmortem study and is recommended for in vivo positron emission tomography studies.

Such quality control requires a fast method to be available for measuring carrier (non-radioactive ligand) in each batch of radioligand, preceding its release for administration. Measurement is usually achieved with HPLC equipped with an ultraviolet (UV) absorbance detector. However, this method is not easily applicable to radioligands that have low UV extinction coefficients and are produced at high specific radioactivity, such as [F-18] (2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl)nortropane; [F-18]FECNT). Here we describe a fast, specific and sensitive LC-MS-MS method for measuring carrier in [F-18]FECNT preparations. Small samples of formulated [F-18]FECNT plus an added internal standard (2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(n-propyl)nortropane; INTSTD) are rapidly eluted from a short reverse phase HPLC column into an MS probe. Following electrospray ionization, the molecular ions ([MH](+)) of FECNT (m/z = 326) and INTSTD (m/z = 322) are isolated and energized for collision-induced dissociation. The product ions from FECNT (m/z = 294) and INTSTD (m/z = 290) are monitored selectively. The calibration curve for MS response is linear for FECNT concentrations in the range 2-20 pg/mu l and suitable for reproducibly (RSD 5%) and rapidly (< 3 min) measuring low concentrations of carrier in [F-18]FECNT preparations.

Characterization of a <i>Pachymedusa dacnicolor</i>-Sauvagine Analog as a New High-Affinity Radioligand for Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor Studies	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; CRF RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; COMPETITIVE ANTAGONISTS; CRH2 RECEPTORS; NMR STRUCTURE; UROTENSIN-I	The corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) peptide family comprises the mammalian peptides CRF and the urocortins as well as frog skin sauvagine and fish urophyseal urotensin. Advances in understanding the roles of the CRF ligand family and associated receptors have often relied on radioreceptor assays using labeled CRF ligands. These assays depend on stable, high-affinity CRF analogs that can be labeled, purified, and chemically characterized. Analogs of several of the native peptides have been used in this context, most prominently including sauvagine from the frog Phyllomedusa sauvageii (PS-Svg). Because each of these affords both advantages and disadvantages, new analogs with superior properties would be welcome. We find that a sauvagine-like peptide recently isolated from a different frog species, Pachymedusa dacnicolor (PD-Svg), is a high-affinity agonist whose radioiodinated analog, [(125)ITyr(0)-Glu(1), Nle(17)]-PD-Svg, exhibits improved biochemical properties over those of earlier iodinated agonists. Specifically, the PD-Svg radioligand binds both CRF receptors with comparably high affinity as its PS-Svg counterpart, but detects a greater number of sites on both type 1 and type 2 receptors. PD-Svg is also similar to 10 times more potent at stimulating cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the native receptors. Autoradiographic localization using the PD-Svg radioligand shows robust specific binding to rodent brain and peripheral tissues that identifies consensus CRF receptor-expressing sites in a greater number and/or with greater sensitivity than its PS-Svg counterpart. We suggest that labeled analogs of PD-Svg may be useful tools for biochemical, structural, pharmacological, and anatomic studies of CRF receptors.

It would however be highly advantageous to have a radioligand able to bind the calcium-activated chloride channel DOG1, which is specific for GIST, and thus enable the sensitive, non-invasive and specific functional imaging of the disease by Positron Emission Tomography (PET). For this purpose, we developed different synthetic strategies towards a 4-phenylthiazole-2-aminebased labeling precursor that can be directly reacted with F-18-fluoride to yield a radiotracer intended to bind DOG1. Of these, a boronic acid pinacol ester radiolabeling precursor could be efficiently reacted with F-18 in a one-step reaction, and the target radioligand [F-18]-fluoro-DOG1 be obtained in radiochemical yields of 34.0 +/- 11.1% within 85 min overall synthesis time.

(Phyllanthaceae) is a medicinal plant that is commonly used to treat diseases such as asthma, diabetes, and anemia. This study aimed to examine the antiallergic activity of P. amarus extract and its compounds. The antiallergic activity was determined by measuring the concentration of allergy markers release from rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells with ketotifen fumarate as the positive control. As a result, P. amarus did not stabilize mast cell degranulation but exhibited antihistamine activity. The antihistamine activity was evaluated by conducting a competition radioligand binding assay on the histamine 1 receptor (H1R). Four compounds were identified from the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis which were phyllanthin (1), hypophyllanthin (2), niranthin (3), and corilagin (4). To gain insights into the binding interactions of the most active compound hypophyllanthin (2), molecular docking was conducted and found that hypophyllanthin (2) exhibited favorable binding in the H1R binding site. In conclusion, P. amarus and hypophyllanthin (2) could potentially exhibit antiallergic activity by preventing the activation of the H1 receptor.

In the present study, we used small-animal PET to characterize the expression of molecular targets in the recently reported HD animal model, the zQ175 mouse model. Methods: Male heterozygous zQ175 (Htt(tm1Mfc)/190JChdi, CHDI-81003003) and wild-type (WT, C57BL/6J) animals were imaged with the dopamine D-2 receptor radioligand C-11-raclopride, the PDE10A radioligand F-18-MNI-659, the dopamine D-1 receptor radioligand (CNNC)-C-11 112, and the 5-HT2A radioligand C-11-MDL 100907 at 6 and 9 mo of age. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND), using the cerebellum as the reference region. Selected regions of interest were the striatum for all radioligands and additionally the striatum, rostral cortex, caudal cortex, and hippocampus for C-11-NNC 112 and C-11-MDL 100907. Results: At 6 mo of age, the BPND in the striatum was lower in zQ175 than WT animals by 40% for 11C-raclopride, by 52% for F-18-MNI-659, by 28% for C-11-NNC, and by 11% for C-11-MDL 100907. In the rostra! cortex, D-1 receptor binding was 22% lower in zQ175 than WT animals. We found an overall reduction in D-1 and 5-HT2A binding in the hippocampus of zQ175 compared with WT animals. The BPND of C-11-MDL 100907 in the caudal cortex was also lower in zQ175 WT animals. At 9 mo, there was a slight further reduction of D-1, D-2, and 5-HT2A BPND in the striatum, whereas PDE10A reached a plateau. Cortical markers were also slightly further decreased at 9 mo in zQ175 animals. Conclusion: Our study indicates a marked reduction of ligand binding to D-1 and D-2 and 5-HT2A receptors as well as loss of PDE10A enzyme in the striatum of zQ175 mice as compared with WT animals, in agreement with data obtained in clinical PET studies of patients with HD. The zQ175 mouse model recapitulates the expression pattern seen in humans with HD and may have value in further elucidating pathophysiologic events and therapeutic strategies.

By combining both modalities, the association between regional gene expression and receptor distribution in the living brain can be approximated. Here, we compare the characteristics of D-2 and D-3 dopamine receptor distribution by applying the dopamine D-2/3 receptor agonist radioligand [C-11]-(+)-PHNO and human gene expression data. Since [C-11]-(+)-PHNO has a higher affinity for D-3 compared to D-2 receptors, we hypothesized that there is a stronger relationship between D 2/3 non-displaceable binding potentials (BPND) and D-3 mRNA expression. To investigate the relationship between D-2/3 BPND and mRNA expression of DRD2 and DRD3 we performed [C-11]-(+)-PHNO PET scans in 27 healthy subjects (12 females) and extracted gene expression data from the AHBA. We also calculated D-2/D-3 mRNA expression ratios to imitate the mixed D-2/3 signal of [C-11]-(+)-PHNO. In accordance with our a priori hypothesis, a strong correlation between [C-11]-(+)-PHNO and DRD3 expression was found. However, there was no significant correlation with DRD2 expression.

(-)-Stepholidine is a potent pan-dopamine receptor antagonist of both G protein- and β-arrestin-mediated signaling	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Stepholidine; Dopamine; Antipsychotic; beta-arrestin; Receptor	L-STEPHOLIDINE; D1 RECEPTOR; FUNCTIONAL SELECTIVITY; COUPLED RECEPTORS; BIASED LIGANDS; DUAL ACTIONS; D-1; AGONIST; BINDING; PHARMACOLOGY	(-)-Stepholidine is a tetrahydroberberine alkaloid that is known to interact with dopamine receptors and has also been proposed as a novel antipsychotic agent. Its suggested novelty lies in the fact that it has been proposed to have D1-like receptor agonist and D2-like receptor antagonist properties. Thus, it might be effective in treating both positive and negative (cognition) symptoms of schizophrenia. However, its activity on specific dopamine receptor subtypes has not been clarified, especially with respect to its ability to activate D1-like receptors. We wished to examine the affinity and functional activity of (-)-stepholidine at each of the human dopamine receptor subtypes expressed in a defined cellular environment. D1-D5 dopamine receptors were stably expressed in cell lines and their interactions with (-)-stepholidine were examined using radioligand binding and various functional signaling assays. Radioligand binding assays were also performed using bovine striatal membranes. (-)-Stepholidine exhibited high (nM) affinity for D1 and D5 receptors, somewhat lower (two- to four-fold) affinity for D2 and D3 receptors, and low micromolar affinity for D4 receptors. Functionally, (-)-stepholidine was ineffective in activating G protein-mediated signaling of D1-like and D2 receptors and was also ineffective in stimulating beta-arrestin recruitment to any dopamine receptor subtype. It did, however, antagonize all of these responses. It also antagonized D1-D2 heteromer-mediated Ca2+ mobilization. Radioligand binding assays of D1-like receptors in brain membranes also indicated that (-)-stepholidine binds to the D1 receptor with antagonist-like properties. (-)-Stepholidine is a pan-dopamine receptor antagonist and its in vivo effects are largely mediated through dopamine receptor blockade with potential cross-talk to other receptors or signaling proteins.

Quantifying the association and dissociation rates of unlabelled antagonists at the muscarinic M<sub>3</sub> receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						association rate (k(on)); competition binding; dissociation rate (k(off)); duration of drug action; equilibrium; kinetics; muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; tiotropium	OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; COMPETITION KINETICS; TIOTROPIUM BROMIDE; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; RATE CONSTANTS; BRAIN CORTEX; BRONCHODILATOR; BA-679-BR; SUBTYPES; MODULATION	1 Slow receptor dissociation kinetics has been implicated in the long clinical duration of action of the muscarinic receptor antagonist tiotropium. However, despite the potential benefits of new drugs with slow dissociation kinetics, the rate parameters of new compounds are seldom measured due to technical difficulties and financial implications associated with radiolabeling multiple ligands. Here we describe the development and optimisation of a medium throughput assay which is capable of measuring the kinetic parameters of novel, unlabelled compounds. 2 Radioligand binding studies were performed with membranes derived from CHO cells recombinantly expressing the human M-3 muscarinic receptor. 3 Initial characterisation of the radioligand [H-3]-NMS yielded on and off rates of 4.1 +/- 0.2 X 10(8) M-1 min(-1) and 0.015 +/- 0.0005 min(-1), respectively. 4 The specific binding of [H-3]-NMS was measured over time in the presence and absence of several concentrations of unlabelled competitor compounds. These data were analysed using a competition kinetic model to provide on and off rates for the unlabelled competitor. Comparison of the kinetically derived Kd (k(off)/k(on)) with K-i values generated at equilibrium showed an excellent correlation (r(2) = 0.99), providing good validation of the method. 5 The on and off rates were also used in theoretical computer simulations to successfully predict the effect of incubation time on apparent IC50 values. 6 This study demonstrates that a medium-throughput competition kinetic binding assay can be used to determine accurate on and off rates of unlabelled compounds, providing the opportunity to optimise for kinetic parameters early in the drug discovery process.

About 10% of patients, however, are diagnosed with early-onset prostate cancer (age at diagnosis: <= 55 years). This is considered to be a distinct clinical and pathological phenotype with a poor prognosis. Generally, prostate cancer cells express high quantities of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on their surface. Radioligand therapy is a type of treatment, which, among other available agents, uses the beta-emitting radionuclide (177)Lutetium (Lu-177) and a PSMA-targeting ligand termed PSMA-617 for internal irradiation of metastatic prostate cancer cells. The aim of our retrospective study was to assess the efficacy and safety of radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 in early-onset metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer patients refractory to chemotherapy. Special emphasis was placed on the patients' response to the treatment and survival. The study provides support for the expected shorter survival compared to heterogenous patient groups. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the outcome of patients with metastasized castration-resistant early-onset prostate cancer refractory to chemotherapy receiving radioligand therapy with (177)Lutetium-PSMA-617 (LuPSMA-RLT). Twenty-five patients of <= 55 years of age at prostate cancer diagnosis, treated with a median of four (IQR 2-6) cycles (mean of 7.7 +/- 1.4 GBq per cycle) every 6-8 weeks, were analyzed. Survival outcome was calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier method. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.8 months (95% CI 2.3-5.3), and overall survival (OS) was 8.5 months (95% CI 6.2-10.8). An initial PSA reduction (>= 50%) was observed in 9/25 (36%) of patients without being significantly associated with OS (p = 0.601). PSA response (PSA decline >= 50% at 12 weeks) was observed in 12/25 (48%) of patients and significantly associated with longer OS (16.0 months, 95% CI 7.4-24.6 vs. 4.0 months, 95% CI 1.1-6.9, p = 0.002). Imaging-based response using Ga-68-PSMA-11-PET/CT after two to three cycles was seen in 11/25 (44%). Additionally, responders had a significantly longer median PFS (8.7 months, 95% CI 1.3-16.1 vs. 1.9 months, 95% CI 1.7-2.2, p < 0.001) and OS (16.0 months, 95% CI 7.6-24.4 vs. 4.0 months, 95% CI 0.9-7.1; p = 0.002). Intra- or post-therapeutic toxicity was graded according to the CTCAE v5.0 criteria. Newly developing grade >= 3 anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in three (12%), one (4%), and three (12%) patients, respectively. One patient showed renal toxicity (grade >= 3) during follow-up. Pain palliation (>2 level VAS decline) was achieved in 9/14 (64%) and performance status improvement (ECOG level decline >= 1) in 8/17 (47%) of patients. Compared to previous reports, radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 in metastasized castration-resistant early-onset prostate cancer patients refractory to chemotherapy yields similar response rates with a comparable safety profile, but is associated with shorter survival.

Their bioactivities were measured by radioligand binding assay, metabolic stability and the tail-flick test. In radioligand binding assays, analogue GAGPC (N-alpha-Amidino-Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Trp-p-Cl-Phe-NH2), shown a mu-opioid receptor affinity about 1.42-fold higher and a 2.51-fold higher delta-opioid receptor affinity than EM-1. In the metabolic stability assays, GAGPC had the longest half-lives which was 284 min and 53-fold higher than that of EM-1. In the tail-flick test in mice, GAGPC chloride modification increases the lipid content of the drug, thus increases the permeability of the blood brain barrier, and has a higher analgesic activity. It might be of importance in potential application as drug candidates as analgesic. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While safety and efficacy could be demonstrated in larger prospective trials irrespective of the tumor burden at Lu-177-PSMA RLT initiation, increased renal absorbed doses due to a reduced tumor sink effect in early responding, oligometastatic mCRPC patients pose difficulties. Response-adapted, dose distributing, intermittent treatment with up to six cycles has not been routinely performed, due to concerns about the potential loss of disease control. Treatment was discontinued in 19 early-responding patients with oligometastatic tumor burden after two (IQR 2-3) cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-RLT and 6.5 +/- 0.7 GBq per cycle and resumed upon Ga-68-PSMA-11-PET/CT-based progression (according to the PCWG3 criteria). Subsequent treatment breaks were imposed if a PSMA-based imaging response could be achieved. A total of five (IQR 3-6) cycles reaching a cumulative activity of 32 +/- 11 GBq were applied. A routine blood work-up including blood counts and liver and renal function was measured throughout the Lu-177-PSMA-RLT and follow-up to grade toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0 criteria. Survival outcome was calculated based on the Kaplan-Meier method. In total, treatment-free periods of 9 (IQR 6-17) cumulative months and the application of Lu-177-PSMA-RLT cycles over 16 (IQR 9-22) months could be achieved. Fifteen (84%) patients responded to subsequent cycles after the first treatment break and in 7/19 (37%) patients, intermittent Lu-177-PSMA-RLT consisted of >= 2 treatment breaks. The median PFS was 27 months (95% CI: 23-31) and overall survival was 45 months (95% CI: 28-62). No grade >= 3 hematological or renal toxicities could be observed during the 45 +/- 21 months of follow-up. The cumulative mean renal absorbed dose was 16.7 +/- 8.3 Gy and 0.53 +/- 0.21 Gy/GBq. Intermittent radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 is feasible in early-responding patients with oligometastatic disease. A late onset of progression after subsequent cycles and the absence of significant toxicity warrants further investigation of the concept of intermittent treatment in selected patients.

By contrast, the radioligand [18F]N-methylbenperidol ([18F]NMB) has high selectivity and affinity for the D2 receptor subtype (D2R) and is not sensitive to endogenous dopamine. Although [18F]NMB has high binding levels in striatum, its utility for measuring D2R in extrastriatal regions is unknown. A composite MR-PET image was constructed across 14 healthy adult participants representing average NMB uptake 60 to 120 min after [18F]NMB injection. Regional peak radioactivity was identified using a peak-finding algorithm. FreeSurfer and manual tracing identified a priori regions of interest (ROI) on each individual's MR image and tissue activity curves were extracted from coregistered PET images. [18F]NMB binding potentials (BPNDs) were calculated using the Logan graphical method with cerebellum as reference region. In eight unique participants, extrastriatal BPND estimates were compared between Logan graphical methods and a three-compartment kinetic tracer model. Radioactivity and BPND levels were highest in striatum, lower in extrastriatal subcortical regions, and lowest in cortical regions relative to cerebellum. Age negatively correlated with striatal BPNDs. BPND estimates for extrastriatal ROIs were highly correlated across kinetic and graphical methods. Our findings indicate that PET with [18F]NMB measures specific binding in extrastriatal regions, making it a viable radioligand to study extrastriatal D2R levels in healthy and diseased states.

In the present study, we found that curcumin caused a concentration-dependent increase of muscle tone in urinary bladder isolated from Wistar rats. This action was inhibited by pirenzepine at concentration enough to block M-1-mAChR. In radioligand-binding assay, specific binding of [H-3]-oxotremorine (OXO-M) in the rat bladder homogenates was also displaced by curcumin in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of inhibitors for PLC-PKC pathway, either U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor) or chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor), curcumin-stimulated contraction in urinary bladder was markedly reduced. In conclusion, the obtained results suggest that curcumin can activate M-1-mAChR at concentrations lower than to scavenge free radicals to increase of muscle tone in urinary bladder through PLC-PKC pathway.

The use of radiolabeled nAChR antagonists would provide a much safer pharmacological profile, avoiding most peripheral side effects that might be generated from radiolabeled nAChR agonists even at the tracer level; thus, PET imaging with nAChR antagonists would facilitate clinical application. A potent and selective nAChR antagonist was labeled and characterized with PET in non-human primates. Its high brain uptake, high signal-to-noise ratio, and high specific binding strongly suggest a great potential to carry out imaging studies in humans. In addition, the use of a C-11 radiotracer would allow us to perform multiple PET studies in the same individual within a short time frame. The presence of an iodine atom in the molecule also allows the possibility to label with radioiodine for SPECT studies. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: In this prospective, single-arm, single-institutional study, 90 mCRPC patients with progressive disease (PD) on second-line hormonal therapy and/or docetaxel chemotherapy were recruited for the study. All patients underwent diagnostic Ga-68-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT, prior to inclusion for therapy. Included patients underwent Lu-177-PSMA-617 therapy at 8- to 12-weekly intervals. The primary end point was to assess the overall survival. The secondary and cosecondary end points included biochemical response assessment as per the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria, progression-free survival, radiological andmolecular response criteria, clinical response, safety profile, and disease control rates. All the outcome parameters were evaluated in 90 patients except for the radiographic and molecular response, which was evaluated in 69 patients. Results: The median age of patients was 66.5 years (range, 30-88 years). The median activity administered per cycle was 3.7 to 8 GBq ranging from 1 to 7 cycles, and patients were followed up over a median duration of 28 months. At 2- to 3-month interval after the first therapy and the end of the assessment, greater than 50% decline in prostate-specific antigen was observed in 32.2% and 45.5%, respectively. Univariate analysis did not reveal any variables such as prior therapies, laboratory parameters, concomitant hormonal therapy, and SUV patient parameters associated with prostate-specific antigen decline. Radiographic response by diagnostic CT revealed partial remission in 23% (16/69), stable disease in 54% (37/69), and PD in 23% (16/69) of patients. Molecular tumor response by PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumor 1 criteria revealed 19 (27.5%) of 69 patients with partial remission, 30 (43.5%) of 69 with stable disease, and 20 (29%) of 69 with PD. The disease control rates according to the radiographic and molecular response-were 77% and 71%, respectively. The median overall survival and median progression-free survivals were 14 and 11.8 months, respectively. Toxicities related to radioligand therapywere lowand transientwith no serious adverse effects. Conclusions: Lu-177-PSMA-617 radionuclide therapy is a safe and effective approach to the treatment of mCRPC patients.

However, the available amyloid PET radioligands, such as C-11-Pittsburgh compound B, reflect levels of insoluble A beta plaques but do not capture soluble and protofibrillar A beta forms. Furthermore, the plaque load appears to be fairly static during clinical stages of AD and may not be affected by A beta-reducing treatments. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether a novel PET radioligand based on an antibody directed toward soluble aggregates of A beta can be used to detect changes in A beta levels during disease progression and after treatment with a beta-secretase (BACE-1) inhibitor. Methods: One set of transgenic mice (tg-ArcSwe, a model of A beta pathology) aged between 7 and 16 mo underwent PET with the A beta protofibril-selective radioligand I-124-RmAb158-scFv8D3 (where RmAb is recombinant mouse monoclonal antibody and scFv is single-chain variable fragment) to follow progression of A beta pathology in the brain. A second set of tg-ArcSwe mice, aged 10 mo, were treated with the BACE-1 inhibitor NB-360 for 3 mo and compared with an untreated control group. A third set of tg-ArcSwe mice, also aged 10 mo, underwent PET as a baseline group. Brain tissue was isolated after PET to determine levels of A beta by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. Results: The concentration of I-124-RmAb158-scFv8D3, as measured in vivo with PET, increased with age and corresponded well with the ex vivo autoradiography and A beta immunohistochemistry results. Mice treated with NB-360 showed significantly lower in vivo PET signals than untreated animals and were similar to the baseline animals. The decreased I-124-RmAb158-scFv8D3 concentrations in NB-360-treated mice, as quantified with PET, corresponded well with the decreased A beta levels measured in postmortem brain. Conclusion: Several treatments for AD are in phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, but the possibility of studying treatment effects in vivo on the important, nonfibrillar, forms of A beta is limited. This study demonstrated the ability of the A beta protofibril-selective radioligand I-124-RmAb158-scFv8D3 to follow disease progression and detect treatment effects with PET imaging in tg-ArcSwe mice.

We recently transferred the S1PR1 radioligand [C-11]CS1P1 into clinical investigation for multiple sclerosis. Herein, we reported the design, synthesis and evaluation of novel F-18 S1PR1 radioligands. We combined the structural advantages of our two lead S1PR1 radioligands and synthesized 14 new S1PR1 compounds, then performed F-18 radiochemistry on the most promising compounds. Compound 6h is potent (IC50 = 8.7 nM) and selective for S1PR1. [F-18]6h exhibited a high uptake in macaque brain (SUV > 3.0) and favorable brain washout pharmacokinetics in positron emission tomography (PET) study. PET blocking and displacement studies confirmed the specificity of [F-18]6h in vivo. Radiometabolite analysis confirmed no radiometabolite of [F-18]6h entered into the brain to confound the PET measurement. In summary, [F-18]6h is a promising radioligand to image S1PR1 and worth translational clinical investigation for humans with brain disorders.

The effect of structural variations of chiral N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilates was investigated using radioligand binding studies oil muscarinic receptors (M-1-M-3). The results of the binding Studies demonstrate that the absolute configuration and the aromatic substituent of benzilates have an influence on muscarillic affinity and selectivity. In this regard, (S)-configuration of benzilates and hydrophilic aromatic substituents seems to enhance muscarinic affinity, A model of the receptor ligand complex for N-methyl-4-piperidyl benzilates was obtained by molecular modelling. Both the affinity of enantiomeric benzilic esters and the subtype selectivity for muscarinic receptors are comprehensively explained by this model. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The tail flick response and behavioral side effects were studied after intrathecal agents in rats. The membrane preparations of the Torpedo Californica and rat cerebral cortices were used for radioligand binding utilizing [H-3] epibatidine displacement. Their affinity to muscular and neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and spinally mediated analgesic potencies were 15, 20, and 3.8 times (analog 1) and 2000, 30,000, and 3.3 times (analog 2) less than epibatidine, respectively. Two times the analgesic 50% effective doses (ED(50)s) of the analogs did not induce side effects, while one-third of that of epibatidine induced motor disturbance. In summary, the two epibatidine analogs have higher potency ratio of spinally mediated analgesia/side effects than epibatidine. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Exploration of the serotonin transporters (5-HTT) in living human brain by PET would be of great value for better understanding, diagnosis and therapeutic follow up of these diseases. In order to obtain a selective radioligand to explore the 5-HTT by PET we report the synthesis of [C-11]N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-iodophenylthio)-benzylamine ([C-11]ADAM). The precursor for labelling N-demethyl ADAM, was obtained in five steps using 2,5-dibromonitrobenzene and 2-thio-N-methylbenzamide as starting material. [C-11]ADAM was synthesised by N-alkylation of the precursor using [C-11]methyl iodide in DMF. The incorporation yield of [C-11]methyl iodide was in the range of 50 to 70%. Finally [C-11]ADAM was obtained in 30 minutes synthesis time including HPLC and with a radiochemical purity better than 99%.

From that perspective, an ET receptor radioligand is needed to assess ET receptor density in vivo. The nonpeptidyl ETA receptor antagonist PD 169390 was labelled with radioiodine to give a putative radioligand for SPECT. Labelling with [I-125]iodide and [I-123]iodide was accomplished with good to excellent radiochemical yields. The affinities of the nonradioactive reference and those of selected precursor compounds for ETA receptors were determined, using [I-125]iodine labelled endothelin-1 with mouse ventricular membranes. All employed substances exhibited potent in vitro pharmacological characteristics with K-i values comparable to that of the lead compound PD 156707. Biodistribution studies and scintigraphic imaging experiments in mice, however, showed no significant uptake of the [I-123] derivative in the heart. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study was undertaken to investigate these issues in rat global brain ischemic model using methods of neuropathological evaluation, radioligand binding assay with and uptake test for L-H-3-glutamate. It was shown that propofol used in anesthetic doses protected pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 subfield against delayed neuronal death normally induced by global brain ischemia. Simultaneously, the propofol decreased the value of maximal number of binding sites (Bmax), increased the value of equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd), and increased the glutamate uptake in the CA1 subfield. These findings indicate that it is, at least partly, via modulating the binding properties of glutamate receptors and the uptake of glutamate that propofol protects neurons against ischemic injury.

Recently, high densities of GRP receptors were identified by in vitro receptor autoradiography in human prostate and breast carcinomas using [I-125-Tyr(4)]BN as radioligand. Radiometal-labeled diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-BN derivatives are potentially useful radioligands for receptor-targeted scintigraphy and radiotherapy of GRP receptor-expressing tumors. Methods: [DTPA-Pro(1),Tyr(4)]BN (A), [DOTA-Pro(1),Tyr(4)]BN (B), [DTPA-is an element of-Lys(3),Tyr(4)]BN (C), and [DOTA-is an element of-LyS(3),Tyr(4)]BN (D) (where DOTA is dodecanetetraacetic acid) were synthesized and studied for competition with binding of [I-125-Tyr(4)]BN to the GRP receptor. The In-111-labeled BN analogs were studied in vitro for binding and internalization by GRP receptor-expressing CA20948 and AR42J pancreatic tumor cells as well as in vivo for tissue distribution in rats. Specific tissue binding was tested by coinjection of 0.1 mg [Tyr(4)]BN. Results: All BN analogs competitively inhibited the binding of [I-125-Tyr(4)]BN to the GRP receptor with 50% inhibitory concentration values in the range of 2-9 nmol/L. All In-111-labeled analogs showed high and specific time- and temperature-dependent binding and internalization by CA20948 and AR42J cells. In in vivo studies, high and specific binding was found in GRP receptor-positive tissues such as pancreas (0.90, 1.2, 0.54, and 0.79 percentage injected dose per gram for A-D, respectively). In a rat model, the AR42J tumor could clearly be visualized by scintigraphy using [In-111-DTPA-Pro(1),Tyr(4)]BN as the radioligand. Although [In-111-DOTA-Pro(1),Tyr(4)]BN showed the highest uptake of radioactivity in GRP receptor-positive tissues as well as higher target-to-blood ratios, [In-111-DTPA-Pro(1),Tyr(4)]BN was easier to handle and is more practical to use. Therefore, we decided to start phase I studies with this DTPA-conjugated radioligand. Conclusion: [In-111-DTPA-Pro(1),Tyr(4)]BN is a promising radioligand for scintigraphy of GRP receptor-expressing tumors. We are currently performing a phase I study on patients with invasive prostate carcinoma.

We have investigated this further in radioligand binding and functional studies and compared the profile of rotigotine with that of other drugs used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Experimental ApproachThe binding of rotigotine to human dopamine D-1, D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-5 receptors was determined in radioligand binding studies using [H-3]rotigotine and compared with that of standard antagonist radioligands. Functional interactions of rotigotine with human dopamine receptors was also determined. Key Results[H-3]rotigotine can be used as an agonist radioligand to label all dopamine receptor subtypes and this can be important to derive agonist affinity estimates. Rotigotine maintains this high affinity in functional studies at all dopamine receptors especially D-1, D-2 and D-3 receptors and, to a lesser extent, D-4 and D-5 receptors. Rotigotine, like apomorphine but unlike ropinirole and pramipexole, was a potent agonist at all dopamine receptors. Conclusions and ImplicationsRotigotine is a high-potency agonist at human dopamine D-1, D-2 and D-3 receptors with a lower potency at D-4 and D-5 receptors. These studies differentiate rotigotine from conventional dopamine D-2 agonists, used in the treatment of PD, such as ropinirole and pramipexole which lack activity at the D-1 and D-5 receptors, but resembles that of apomorphine which has greater efficacy in PD than other dopamine agonists but has suboptimal pharmacokinetic properties.

The cerebral inflammatory immune process has been implied to play a pivotal role in the onset of affective symptoms in several conditions. In order to gain insight into the mechanism underlying the depressive behaviors in hypothyroid rats, brain microglial activation was evaluated using micro positron emission tomography imaging with a translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand. Hypothyroidism was induced in adult male Wistar rats by administration of 0.05% propylthiouracil in drinking water for five weeks. Open field, forced swimming and tail suspension tests were employed to evaluate the depressive behavior in hypothyroid rats, and the relationship between the behavioral changes and brain microglial activation was evaluated using [F-18] DPA-714 micro positron emission tomography imaging. The open field test revealed significantly reduced first-minute activity and rearing behavior in the hypothyroid group, as well as significantly increased immobility in the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test. Hypothyroidism induced significantly increased microglial activation in the hippocampus. The radioligand uptake in the hippocampus correlated negatively with first-minute activity in the open field test (p < 0.05), and the radioligand uptake in the hippocampus correlated positively with changes in the immobility time in the forced swimming test and the tail suspension test (p < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry also confirmed the activation of microglia and inflammatory bodies in hypothyroid rats. The results indicate that hypothyroidism can induce depressive behavior in adult Wistar rats, microglial activation in the hippocampus plays an important role in the depressive behavior in hypothyroid rats and the inflammatory immune mechanism may underlie the behavioral abnormalities in thyroid dysfunction. Furthermore, the findings in the present study suggest there might be a common mechanism underlying depressive behavior in adult-onset hypothyroidism and depression.

This approach allows estimation of the inhibition of a well-characterized selective (standard) radioligand by unlabelled potential drugs or direct measurement of the distribution and receptor binding of a standard radioligand or radiolabelled form of a novel drug. In fact, these studies could be conducted in various tissues from animals pretreated with radioligands and/or unlabelled novel drugs, by conventional radioligand binding assay, radioactivity measurement, autoradiography and positron emission tomography. In vivo and ex vivo receptor binding with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists and muscarinic receptor antagonists have been proved to be useful in predicting the potency, organ selectivity and duration of action of drugs in relation to their pharmacokinetics. Such evaluations of drug-receptor binding reveal that adverse effects could be avoided by the use of new alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists and muscarinic receptor antagonists for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms. Thus, the comparative analysis of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptor binding characteristics in the lower urinary tract and other tissues after systemic administration of therapeutic agents allows the rationale for their pharmacological characteristics from the integrated viewpoint of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The current review emphasizes the usefulness of in vivo and ex vivo receptor binding in the discovery and development of novel drugs for the treatment of not only urinary dysfunction but also other disorders.

We developed a PET ligand with an aryloxyanilide structure, [O-methyl-C-11]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine ([C-11]PBR28), to image PBRs. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate kinetics of brain uptake, and the influence of the peripheral binding on the arterial input function in rhesus monkey. Methods: Brain (baseline: n=6, blocking: n=1) and whole-body PET imaging (baseline: n=3, blocking: n=1) of [C-11]PBR28 were performed with the measurement of radio metabolite-corrected arterial input function in all brain and two whole body scans. Results: Saturating doses of nonradioactive PBR ligands markedly increased [C-11]PBR28 in plasma (similar to 400% increase) and brain (similar to 200%) at 2 min by displacing radioligand from PBRs in peripheral organs. Brain uptake of radioactivity peaked in baseline scans at similar to 40 min after injection of [C-11]PBR28 and was high (similar to 300% standardized uptake value). The images showed no receptor-free region that could be used for reference tissue analysis. Thus, quantitation of receptor density required measurement of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. Nondisplaceable uptake was estimated from the blocked scans and was only similar to 5% of total distribution volume measured under baseline conditions. Distribution volume of [C-11]PBR28 was stably determined within 110 min of scanning. Conclusions: Regional brain uptake of [C-11]PBR28 in monkey could be quantified as a value proportional to the density of receptors-namely, as equilibrium distribution volume. [C-11]PBR28 had high levels of specific binding in brain and should provide a sensitive measure of changes in PBRs. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The radioligand shows consistent binding characteristics, in vivo, in both species. Early time frames of the microPET images and time activity curves of brain indicate poor penetration of the tracer across the blood brain barrier (BBB) in both species. However, microPET experiments in mice and rats show high binding of the radioligand outside the brain to heart, pancreas and muscle, the organs known for higher expression of IGF1R/1R. Biodistribution analysis 2 h after injection of [F-18]BMS-754807 in rats show negligible [F-18]defluorination as reflected by the low bone uptake and clearance from blood. Overall, the data indicate that [F-18]BMS-754807 can potentially be a radiotracer for the quantification of IGF1R/IR outside the brain using PET. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With SPECT/CT imaging, we measured the brain uptake of radioactivity, using %SUV (% standardised uptake values) in CB1R-/- mice (n = 3) and C57BL6 wildtype mice (n = 7) under urethane anaesthesia after injecting [I-125]SD7015 intravenously or intraperitoneally. The Brookhaven Laboratory mouse MRI atlas was fused to the SPECT/CT images by using a combination of rigid and non-rigid algorithms in the Mediso FuSiori (TM) (Mediso, Budapest, Hungary) and VivoQuant (inviCRO, Boston, MA, USA) softwares. Phosphor imager plate autoradiography (ARG) was performed on 4 mu m-thin cryostat sections of the excised brains. %SUV was 8.6 +/- 3.6 (average +/- SD) in (CBR)-R-1-/- mice and 22.1 +/- 12.4 in wildtype mice between 2 and 4 h after injection (p < 0.05). ARG of identically taken sections from wildtype mouse brain showed moderate radioactivity uptake when compared with the in vivo images, with a clear difference between grey matter and white matter, whereas ARG in CB1R(-/-) mice showed practically no radioactivity uptake. [I-125]SD7015 enters the mouse brain in sufficient amount to enable SPECT imaging. Brain radioactivity distribution largely coincides with that of the known CB1R expression pattern in rodent brain. We conclude that [I-125]SD7015 should be a useful SPECT radioligand for studying brain CB1R in mouse and rat disease models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Since early detection of beta-amyloid may facilitate more successful and timely therapeutic interventions, many investigators have focused on developing AD diagnostic reagents that can penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Oleanolic acid (OA) is a substance found in a variety of plants that has been reported to prevent the progression of AD in mice. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated a new radioligand in which OA was conjugated to lactofen-in (Lf, an iron-binding glycoprotein that crosses the BBB) for the diagnosis of AD. In an in vitro study in which OA-Lf was incubated with beta-amyloid (1-42) aggregates for 24 h, we found that OA-Lf effectively inhibited beta-amyloid aggregation and fibril formation. In vivo studies demonstrated that I-123-OA-Lf brain uptake was higher than I-123-Lf uptake. Therefore, radiolabeled OA-Lf may have diagnostic potential for beta-amyloid imaging.

Genomic characterization of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients undergoing PSMA radioligand therapy: A single-center experience	PROSTATE			English	Article						metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; mutations; next-generation sequencing; prostate-specific membrane antigen; PSMA; radioligand therapy	VISCERAL METASTASES; SURVIVAL; OUTCOMES; REPAIR	Background Genomic defects in DNA-damage repair (DDR) mechanisms have been proposed to affect the radiosensitivity of prostate cancers. In this study, we intended to evaluate the prevalence of genetic alterations in a cohort of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients undergoing radioligand therapy (RLT) with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-inhibitors as well as the impact of such mutations on treatment outcomes. Methods Data of consecutive mCRPC patients from 2017 to 2021 who were treated with PSMA-RLT and underwent next-generation sequencing (NGS) were collected and analyzed for response and survival outcomes. Results In 95 patients of mCRPC treated with PSMA-RLT, 15 patients (median age: 66 years, range: 50-73 years; [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, n = 12; [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617, n = 3) underwent NGS. The median progression-free survival (PFS) of this cohort was 3 months (95% confidence interval: 1.6-4.4 months). On NGS, 21 genetic alterations were reported in 10/15 (67%) patients, of which 13 were DDR-associated alterations involving the genes: ATM (n = 3), BRCA2 (n = 3), TP53 (n = 2), PTEN (n = 2), FANCD2 (n = 1), FANCM (n = 1), and NBN (n = 1). Overall, 5/15 (33%) patients harbored six pathogenic variants (BRCA2, n = 2; ATM, n = 1; TP53, n = 1; PTEN, n = 2). No significant difference was noted for the biochemical response, radiological response, PFS, and overall survival between the patients with and without genetic alterations. Conclusions Patients of mCRPC undergoing PSMA-RLT were frequently seen to harbor DDR-associated aberrations, albeit with no significant impact on treatment outcomes. Large prospective trials comparing PSMA-RLT-related outcomes in DDR-deficient and -proficient patients are required to bring out the differences, if any, in a more observable manner.

Our study evaluated the response to RLT using both molecular imaging and biochemical response assessments, and their potential prediction of progression-free survival (PFS). Fifty-one consecutive patients given two cycles of RLT at 6-week intervals were analyzed retrospectively. Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT was obtained about 2 weeks prior to the first and 4-6 weeks after the second cycle. Molecular imaging-based response using SUVpeak and tumor-to-liver ratio (TLR) was determined by modified PERCIST criteria. Delta TLR and Delta SUV were significantly correlated with Delta PSA (p < 0.001, each). After a median follow-up of 49 months, the median PFS (95% CI) was 8.0 (5.9-10.1) months. In univariate analysis, responders showing partial remission (PRPSA and PRTLR) had significantly (p < 0.001, each) longer PFS (median: 10.5 and 9.3 months) than non-responders showing either stable or progressive disease (median: 4.0 and 3.5 months). Response assessment using SUVpeak failed to predict survival. In multivariable analysis, response assessment using TLR was independently associated with PFS (p < 0.001), as was good performance status (p = 0.002). Molecular imaging-based response assessment with Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT using normalization of the total lesion PSMA over healthy liver tissue uptake (TLR) could be an appropriate biomarker to monitor RLT in mCRPC patients and to predict progression-free survival (PFS) of this treatment modality.

Although many efforts have been made to improve the performance of putative radioligand candidates, there is still a lack of D4R selective tracers suitable for in vivo PET imaging. Thus, the objective of this work was to develop a D-4-selective PET ligand for clinical applications. Methods: Four compounds based on previous and new lead structures were prepared and characterized with regard to their D4R subtype selectivity and predicted lipophilicity. From these, 3-((4-(2-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)methyl)-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine I and (S)-4-(3-fluoro-4-methoxybenzyl)-2-(phenoxymethyl)morpholine II were selected for labeling with fluorine-18 and subsequent evaluation by in vitro autoradiography to assess their suitability as D-4 radioligand candidates for in vivo imaging. Results: The radiosynthesis of [F-18]I and [F-18]II was successfully achieved by copper-mediated radiofluorination with radiochemical yields of 7% and 66%, respectively. The radioligand [F-18]II showed specific binding in areas where D-4 expression is expected, whereas [F-18]I did not show any uptake in distinct brain regions and exhibited an unacceptable degree of non-specific binding. Conclusions: The compounds studied exhibited high D4R subtype selectivity and logP values compatible with high brain uptake, but only ligand [F-18]II showed low non-specific binding and is therefore a good candidate for further evaluation. Advances in knowledge: The discovery of new lead structures for high-affinity D-4 ligands opens up new possibilities for the development of suitable PET-radioligands. Implications for patient: PET-imaging of dopamine D-4-receptors could facilitate understanding, diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The density of D-1 receptors, VMAT2, and DAT was measured using [H-3]SCH23390, [H-3]dihydrotetrabenazine, and [H-3]WIN35428, respectively. The density of D-2 and D-3 receptors was calculated using the D-3-preferring radioligand, [H-3] WC-10 and the D-2-preferring radioligand [H-3]raclopride using a mathematical model developed previously by our group. Dopamine D-1, D-2, and D-3 receptors are extensively distributed throughout striatum; the highest density of D-3 receptors occurred in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The density of the DAT is 10-20-fold lower than that of VMAT2 in striatal regions. Dopamine D-3 receptor density exceeded D-2 receptor densities in extrastriatal regions, and thalamus contained a high level of D-3 receptors with negligible D-2 receptors. The density of dopamine D-1 linearly correlated with D-3 receptor density in the thalamus. The density of the DAT was negligible in the extrastriatal regions whereas the VMAT2 was expressed in moderate density. D-3 receptor and VMAT2 densities were in similar level between the aged human and aged rhesus brain samples, whereas aged human brain samples had lower range of densities of D-1 and D-2 receptors and DAT compared with the aged rhesus monkey brain. The differential density of D-3 and D-2 receptors in human brain will be useful in the interpretation of PET imaging studies in human subjects with existing radiotracers, and assist in the validation of newer PET radiotracers having a higher selectivity for dopamine D-2 or D-3 receptors.

Thermodynamics and Docking of Agonists to the β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenoceptor Determined Using [<SUP>3</SUP>H](<i>R</i>,<i>R</i>′)-4-Methoxyfenoterol as the Marker Ligand	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-FIELD ANALYSIS; HIGH-AFFINITY BINDING; FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE; FENOTEROL DERIVATIVES; INTACT-CELLS; ADRENOCEPTOR; STATES; STEREOISOMERS	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are integral membrane proteins that change conformation after ligand binding so that they can transduce signals from an extracellular ligand to a variety of intracellular components. The detailed interaction of a molecule with a G protein-coupled receptor is a complicated process that is influenced by the receptor conformation, thermodynamics, and ligand conformation and stereoisomeric configuration. To better understand the molecular interactions of fenoterol analogs with the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor, we developed a new agonist radioligand for binding assays. [H-3](R,R')-methoxyfenoterol was used to probe the binding affinity for a series of fenoterol stereoisomers and derivatives. The results suggest that the radioligand binds with high affinity to an agonist conformation of the receptor, which represents approximately 25% of the total beta(2)-adrenoceptor (AR) population as determined with the antagonist [H-3]CGP-12177. The beta(2)-AR agonists tested in this study have considerably higher affinity for the agonist conformation of the receptor, and K-i values determined for fenoterol analogs model much better the cAMP activity of the beta(2)-AR elicited by these ligands. The thermodynamics of binding are also different when interacting with an agonist conformation, being purely entropy-driven for each fenoterol isomer, rather than a mixture of entropy and enthalpy when the fenoterol isomers binding was determined using [H-3]CGP-12177. Finally, computational modeling identified the molecular interactions involved in agonist binding and allow for the prediction of additional novel beta(2)-AR agonists. The study underlines the possibility of using defined radioligand structure to probe a specific conformation of such shape-shifting system as the beta(2)-adrenoceptor.

However, there was very little binding in the rat cerebellum, heart, kidney, liver, and lung membranes. Binding was rapid and reached equilibrium in about 5 min. Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms revealed two different populations of binding sites in the rat cerebral cortex (K-d1, 795 nM, B-max1, 25.4 pmol/mg of protein; K-d2, 21 muM; B-max2, 178 pmol/mg of protein) as well as in the rat hippocampus (K-d1, 441 nM; B-max1, 16.2 pmol/mg of protein; K-d2, 9.8 muM; B-max2, 255 pmol/mg of protein). (+/-)Baclofen (500 muM) and gamma -aminobutyric acid (100 muM) inhibited the binding only partially, whereas (+)bicuculline, muscimol, picrotoxinin, and phaclofen did not modify the binding. Interestingly, potassium chloride (100-300 mM) inhibited [H-3]NCS-382 binding (34-56%), and this inhibitory effect was not affected by picrotoxinin. GHB and NCS-382 completely inhibited the [H-3]NCS-382 (16 nM) binding in the rat cerebrocortical and hippocampal membranes, and NCS-382 was found to be about 10 times more potent than GHB in this regard. A variety of ligands for other receptors did not modify the [H-3]NCS-382 binding, thereby suggesting selectivity of this radioligand for the GHB receptor sites in the brain. Based on these observations, [H-3]NCS-382 seems to be a better radioligand than [H-3]GHB for investigating the role of the GHB receptors in various pharmacological actions.

Under the conditions chosen, [3H]pirenzepine would predominately bind to muscarinic(1) (M-1) and muscarinic(4) (M-4) receptors,(7) whereas [H-3]AF-DX 384 would mainly bind to muscarinic(2) (M-2) and M-4 receptors.(8) Given the relative concentrations of M-1, M-2 and M-4 receptors in the human CP and the magnitude of the decreases in radioligand binding in schizophrenia, our results most likely reflected a change in the density of M-1 and M-2 receptors in the CP from the schizophrenic subjects. In situ hybridisation has now been used to determine levels of m1 and m2 mRNA in CP from 14 schizophrenic and 16 control subjects previously used for radioligand binding. m2 mRNA in the CP from the schizophrenic and control subjects was below the sensitivity of in situ hybridisation. There was no difference in the levels of mi mRNA in CP from schizophrenic and control subjects (mean +/- SEM: 103 +/- 16 vs 106 +/- 17 fmol [S-35]oligonucleotide probe g(-1) estimated tissue equivalents, P = 0.91). In conclusion, data from our radioligand binding studies show decreases in [H-3]pirenzepine binding that are likely to reflect a decrease in the density of M-1 receptors in CP from schizophrenic subjects. Our data in this study show the absence of a concomitant change in mRNA coding for that receptor.

There is a recognised need to develop halogenated ligands for 5-HT1A receptors, either for labelling with longer lived fluorine-18 for more widespread application with PET or with iodine-123 for application with single photon emission tomography (SPET). Here we used autoradiography and PET to assess two new halogenated anlogues of WAY, namely 6BPWAY and 6FPWAY [N-(2-(1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-piperazinyl) ethyl))-N-(2-(6-bromo-/fluoro-pyridinyl))cyclohexanecarboxamide] as prospective radioligands, initially using carbon-11 as the radiolabel. Labelling of 6BPWAY and 6FPWAY with carbon-11 was accomplished by acylation of the corresponding secondary amine precursors with [carbonyl-C-11]cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride. After incubation of human brain crysections with [C-11]6BPWAY or [C-11]6FPWAY, the highest accumulation of radioactivity was observed in cortical areas and the hippocampal formation. Both radioligands had high nonspecific binding. There was a rapid accumulation of radioactivity in the monkey brain after intravenous injection of [C-11]6BPWAY and [C-11]6FPWAY. High accumulation of radioactivity was observed in the frontal and temporal cortex and the raphe nuclei, areas known to contain a high density of 5-HT1A receptors. The ratios of radioactivity in receptor-rich temporal cortex to that in receptor poor cerebellum at peak equilibrium were 1.9 (at 10 min) and 3.0 at (at 20 min) for [C-11]6BPWAY and [C-11]6FPWAY, respectively. In pretreatment experiments with high doses of unlabelled WAY, the level of radioactivity in the frontal and temporal cortex and the raphe nuclei was reduced to the same level as in the cerebellum. Radioactive metabolites of [C-11]6FPWAY appeared at a rate similar to those for [C-11]WAY, with 17% of the radioactivity in plasma represented by unchanged radioligand after 40 min. Radioactive metabolites of [C-11]6BPWAY appeared much more slowly. At 40 min after injection 45% of the radioactivity in plasma still represented unchanged radioligand. The results indicate that 6-pyridinyl radiohalogented analogues of WAY are new leads to radioligands for PET or SPET. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

They have previously been shown in radioligand binding studies to have high selectivity and affinity for individual muscarinic receptor subtypes, but less is known of their functional effects. This study has examined the actions of two of these MTs, MT2 and MT7, using changes in cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) measured using the fluorescent indicator fura-2 in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with individual muscarinic receptor subtypes, m1, m3 and m5. MT2 activated the m1 receptor: at concentrations above 100 nM it caused significant and concentration-dependent increases in [Ca2+](i). From 25 to 800 nM MT2 also produced increases in [Ca2+](i) by activating m3 receptors, although these increases in [Ca2+](i) were not strictly concentration-dependent with only intermittent responses being recorded (i.e. it was not always possible to obtain a response to the agonist with each application of the compound). MT2 (800-1600 nM) also caused significant increases in [Ca2+](i) in CHO cells expressing the m5 muscarinic receptor subtype. MT7 (1 muM) displayed no agonist activity at any of the muscarinic receptors but was a potent non-competitive antagonist (at 20 nM) at the ml muscarinic receptor subtype. It had no antagonist activity at the m3 or m5 subtypes. These results indicate that MT7 is a highly specific antagonist at the ml muscarinic receptor subtype as suggested by results from radioligand binding studies. However, MT2 is less selective for the ml muscarinic receptor than previously described as it also exhibits agonist activity at the m3 and m5 muscarinic receptors, which was not detected in radioligand binding studies.

Methods alpha (1)-Adrenergic receptors were quantified by radioligand binding assays, employing [H-3]-prazosin as the radioligand in association with compounds displaying different degrees of selectivity for alpha (1A)-, alpha (1B)- and alpha (1D)-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Results The affinity of [H-3]-prazosin binding was similar in peripheral blood lymphocytes of different stage essential hypertensive and normotensive subjects or of SHR and age-matched normotensive WKY rats as well as in the aortas of SHR and WKY rats. The radioligand binding assay revealed no change in the expression of alpha (1)-adrenergic receptors in peripheral blood lymphocytes of essential hypertensives compared with normotensive subjects; a moderate decrease Of alpha (1B)-adrenergic receptors and an increase Of alpha (1D)-adrenergic receptors. The relative densities of the alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes were similar in the three groups of essential hypertensives. In peripheral blood lymphocytes and in aorta of SHR, [H-3]prazosin binding was significantly reduced compared with normotensive WKY rats. The expression of alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes in peripheral blood lymphocytes of SHR was similar to that found in peripheral blood lymphocytes of essential hypertensives. Conclusions Changes of lymphocyte alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes in essential hypertensives are similar to those observed in lymphocytes and vascular tissues of animal models of hypertension. This suggests that assays of lymphocyte alpha (1)-adrenergic receptors may represent an indirect marker of their involvement in essential hypertension. (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

METHODS: pREP8/alpha(1A)-AR, pREP4/alpha(1B)-AR, and pREP9/(alpha 1D)-AR were transfected, respectively, into HEK293 cells by calcium phosphate precipitation. The expression of alpha(1)-AR was detected by radioligand binding assays. DNA synthesis was measured by [H-3]thymidine incorporation. CCDPK activity was determined by immunoprecipitation method and myelin basic protein was used as substrate. RESULTS: Three clonal HEK293 cell lines stably expressing alpha(1A)-or alpha(1B)- or alpha(1D)-AR were chosen and characterized by radioligand binding assay with receptor densities of about 0.6 nmol.g(-1). Treatment with norepinephrine (NE) in the presence of propranolol for 24 h increased DNA synthesis in HEK293/alpha(1A)- or HEK293/alpha(1B)-AR cells concentration-dependently, with EC50 values of 48.8 nmol.L-1(95 % confidence limits 9.7 - 246 nmol L-1) and 8.4 nmol.L-1 (95 % confidence Limits 2.1-32.9 nmol L-1), respectively. The increase of DNA synthesis induced by NE 10 mu mol.L-1 was 201 % +/- 28 % and 269 % +/- 44! % of basal, and the activation of CCDPK was 171 % +/- 84 % and 292 % +/- 92 % of basal in HEK293/alpha(1A)-AR and HEK293/alpha(1B)-AR cells, respectively. Preincubation with prazosin completely abolished NE-induced CCDPK activation in HEK293/alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-AR cells. Those changes were not found in HEK293/alpha(1D)-AR cells. CONCLUSION: The activation of alpha(1A)- or alpha(1B)-AR but not alpha(1D)-AK induces cell proliferation.

Methods In this prospective imaging study, innate immune cells were investigated in the MS patient brain using PET imaging. The distribution volume ratio (DVR) of the TSPO-binding radioligand [C-11]PK11195 was determined in 5 GM regions: thalamus, caudate, putamen, pallidum, and cortical GM. Volumetric brain MRI parameters were obtained for comparison. The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was assessed at baseline and after follow-up of 3.0 +/- 0.3 (mean +/- SD) years. Disability progression was defined as an EDSS score increase of 1.0 point or 0.5 point if the baseline EDSS score was >= 6.0. A forward-type stepwise logistic regression model was constructed to compare multiple imaging and clinical variables in their ability to predict later disability progression. Results The cohort consisted of 66 patients with MS and 18 healthy controls. Patients with later disability progression (n = 17) had more advanced atrophy in the thalamus, caudate, and putamen at baseline compared with patients with no subsequent worsening. TSPO binding was significantly higher in the thalamus among the patients with later worsening. The thalamic DVR was the only measured imaging variable that remained a significant predictor of disability progression in the regression model. The final model predicted disability progression with 52.9% sensitivity and 93.9% specificity with an area under the curve value of 0.82 (receiver operating characteristic curve). Discussion Increased TSPO radioligand binding in the thalamus has potential in predicting short-term disability progression in MS and seems to be more sensitive for this than GM atrophy measures.

The remaining fractions, however, do not respond to RLT. The aim of this explorative analysis was to identify pre-therapeutic factors for the prediction of response. Methods 46 patients [age = 68 years (50-87)] with mCRPC who consecutively underwent RLT with Lu-177 PSMA [median applied activity = 6 GBq (2.9-6.2)] were included and analysed retrospectively. The association of different clinical and laboratory factors and parameters from pre-therapeutic Ga-68 PSMA positron emission tomography (PET) with the outcome of RLT was tested (Fisher's test). Outcome was defined as PSA changes 8 weeks after second RLT [partial response (PR), PSA decrease > 50%; progressive disease (PD), PSA increase >= 25%; stable disease (SD), others]. Significant predictive factors were combined in a predictive score. Results 30% showed a post-treatment PR (median 73% PSA decrease), 35% SD (median 17% PSA decrease) and 35% PD (median 42% PSA increase). Significant predictors for PD were alkaline phosphatase (ALP) > 135 U/l (p = 0.002), PSA > 200 ng/ml (p = 0.036), and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the "hottest lesion" in pre-therapeutic PET < 45 (p = 0.005). The predictive score including PSA, ALP and SUVmax could separate 2 distinct groups of patients: <= 2 predictive factors (19% PD) and 3 predictive factors (90% PD). Conclusion The presented predictive score allowed a pre-therapeutic estimate of the expected response to 2 cycles of RLT. As our study was retrospective, prospective trials are needed for validation.

METHODS: (1) Full-length cDNA encoding three alpha(1)-AR subtypes were transfected into HEK293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method, respectively. (2) The densities of alpha(1)-AR subtypes expressed in HEK293 cells were measured by radioligand binding assay. (3) cAMP accumulation was measured by [H-3] adenine prelabeling method. RESULTS: (1) Activation of each of three subtypes resulted in an increase of cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited by selective alpha(1)-AR antagonist prazosin. (2) Comparing the pharmacological property, the maximal responses of alpha(1A)-AR to agonists were the most potent, while the sensitivity of alpha(1)-AR subtypes to norepinephrine (NE) was the highest. CONCLUSION: Each of three alpha(1)-AR subtypes can mediate cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cell line, and there are differences in pharmacological property.

Compounds 4-7 were prepared by esterifying the 3 beta -hydroxyl group of ecgonine methyl ester (3) using the appropriate acid chloride in the presence of Et3N and benzene. Compound 3 was obtained from cocaine (1) by hydrolysis using 1N HCl to afford ecgonine.HCI which was subjected to acid catalyzed esterification using methanol saturated with HCl gas. Compound 8 was obtained by hydrogenation of 7 using H-2/Pd-C. The IC50 values were calculated from displacement experiment of the radioligand [H-3]WIN-35,428 (2). 2'-Aminococaine (8) showed high binding affinity to the DAT (14- and 1.3-fold more active than cocaine and the radioligand 2, respectively). These results, along with previous results, emphasize the importance of a hydrogen-bond donor group at the 2'-position of cocaine to enhance binding affinity to the DAT.

As prostate-specific antigen (PSA) plays an important role in the response evaluation of this therapy, and the aim of this study was to prospectively assess the prognostic value of early PSA measurements. We found PSA changes as early as four weeks after the first administration of PSMA-RLT to be predictive of both long-term biochemical and PET imaging response, as well as overall survival. We then evaluated relevant predictive thresholds in PSA change at that time point, as the early detection of long-term (non-)response to PSMA-RLT can be of great benefit in the clinical management of terminally ill mCRPC-patients. Purpose: Radioligand therapy with [Lu-177]PSMA-617 (PSMA-RLT) is a promising therapeutic option for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCPRP). This study assessed the prognostic value of early PSA measurements during PSMA-RLT. Methods: 27 patients with mCRPC scheduled for PSMA-RLT were prospectively enrolled for a serial short-interval PSA-assessment. Change in PSA ( increment %PSA) during two treatment cycles was correlated with biochemical response (BR) and change in tumor volume on PET (TV) after 16 weeks (w16), as well as overall survival (OS). PCWG3 criteria and the recently recommended threshold of increment %PSA <= -30% were assessed for their predictive value. Results: increment %PSA first correlated with BR, TV and OS after 4 weeks (c1w4). At c1w4, increment %PSA <= -30% was associated with the biochemical response at w16 (p = 0.003) and a longer median OS (p = 0.025), whereas the PCWG3-derived threshold of increment %PSA <= -50% showed no such correlation. In contrast, increment %PSA >= 25% at c1w4 was associated with biochemical progression at w16 (p = 0.003) and a shorter median OS (p < 0.001). Conclusion: PSA changes as early as four weeks after PSMA-RLT allow a significant prediction of later biochemical and PET-based imaging response, as well as OS. At this early time point, a more lenient threshold for a PSA decrease of at least 30% appears better-suited for the prediction of a positive biochemical response and longer OS. In contrast, the PCWG3-derived threshold for PSA increase (+25%) reliably anticipates biochemical progression and shorter OS.

An efficient synthesis and radiolabeling of a biphenylthiol, FLIP-IDAM, 4, was accomplished. The affinity of FLIP-IDAM was evaluated by an in vitro inhibitory binding assay using [I-125]-IDAM as radioligand in rat brain tissue homogenates (K-i = 0.03 nM). New [I-125]Flip-IDAM exhibited excellent binding affinity to SERT binding sites with a high hypothalamus to cerebellum ratio of 4 at 30 min post iv injection. The faster in vivo kinetics for brain uptake and a rapid washout from non-specific regions provide excellent signal to noise ratio. This new agent, when labeled with I-123, may be a useful imaging agent for mapping SERT binding sites in the human brain. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In radioligand binding experiments, 3' IBVM displays subnanomolar affinity for VAChT and 100-fold selectivity for VAChT over sigma1 and sigma2 receptors. Consistent with this profile, radioiodinated (+/-) 3'-IBVM distributed heterogenously in the rat brain following a bolus IV injection, displaying high concentrations in the striatum and moderate to low concentrations in the cortex and cerebellum, respectively. However, co injection of the radiotracer with the sigma ligand haloperidol resulted in significant reductions of radiotracer levels in all brain regions examined. Therefore, radioiodinated (+/-)-IBVM appears to bind to both VAChT and sigma receptors in vivo. NUCL MED BIOL 27;8:749-755, 2000. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

H3 receptor inverse agonists (IAs) may be efficacious in the treatment of various central nervous system disorders, including excessive daytime sleepiness, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer disease, ethanol addiction, and obesity. Methods: Using PET and a novel high-affinity and selective radioligand C-11-MK-8278, we studied the tracer biodistribution, quantification, and brain H3 receptor occupancy (RO) of MK-0249 and MK-3134, 2 potential IA drugs targeting cerebral H3 receptors, in 6 healthy male subjects (age, 19-40 y). The relationship among H3 IA dose, time on target, and peripheral pharmacokinetics was further investigated in 15 healthy male volunteers (age, 18-40 y) with up to 3 PET scans and 3 subjects per dose level. Results: The mean effective dose for C-11-MK-8278 was 5.4 +/- 1.1 mu Sv/MBq. Human brain kinetics showed rapid high uptake and fast washout. Binding potential values can be assessed using the pons as a reference region, with a test-retest repeatability of 7%. Drug RO data showed low interindividual variability per dose (mean RO SD, 2.1%), and a targeted 90% RO can be reached for both IAs at clinically feasible doses. Conclusion: C-11-MK-8278 is a useful novel PET radioligand for determination of human cerebral H3 receptor binding and allows highly reproducible in vivo brain occupancy of H3-targeting drugs, hereby enabling the evaluation of novel compounds in early development to select doses and schedules.

To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we investigated the effects of the antiarrhythmic peptide AAP10 (GAG-4Hyp-PY-CONH2) on pairs of adult guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes and pairs of HeLa cells transfected with rat cardiac connexin 43 (Cx43). By using a double-cell voltage-clamp technique in pairs of cardiomyocytes, we found that under control conditions the gap junction conductance (gj) steadily decreased with time (by 0.292 +/- 0.130 nS/min). Use of 50 nmol/L AAP10 reversed this rundown and increased gj (by +0.290 +/- 0.231 nS/min, P<0.05). This effect of AAP10 could be significantly antagonized by bisindolylmaleimide I (BIM) and by the protein kinase C (PKC) subtype-specific inhibitor CGP54345 (PKC alpha). In HeLa-Cx43 cells, AAP10 exerted the same electrophysiological effect. In these cells, AAP10 activated PKC (determined by using ELISA) in CGP54345-sensitive manner and significantly enhanced incorporation of P-32 into Cx43 with dependence on PKC. If G-protein coupling was inhibited with 1 mM GDP-beta S, we found the effects of AAP10 on P-32 incorporation were also completely abolished. Next, we performed a radioligand binding study with C-14-AAP10 as radioligand and AAPnat as competitor. We found saturable binding of C-14-AAP10 to cardiac membrane preparations, which could be displaced with AAPnat. The K-d of AAP10 was 0.88 nmol/L. We conclude that 1) AAP10 increases gj both in adult cardiomyocytes and in transfected HeLa-Cx43 cells, 2) AAP10 exerts its effect via enhanced PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Cx43, 3) AAP10 activates PKC alpha, and 4) a membrane receptor exists for antiarrhythmic peptides in cardiomyocytes.

Herein, we report on the synthesis of a series of CB2R affine fluorinated indole-2-carboxamide ligands. Compound RM365 was selected for PET radiotracer development due to its high CB2R affinity (K- i = 2.1 nM) and selectivity over CB1R (factor > 300). Preliminary in vitro evaluation of [F-18]-RM365 indicated species differences in the binding to CB2R (K (D )of 2.32 nM for the hCB2R vs K (D) > 10,000 nM for the rCB2R). Metabolism studies in mice revealed a high in vivo stability of [F-18]-RM365. PET imaging in a rat model of local hCB2R-(D80N) overexpression in the brain demonstrates the ability of [F-18]-RM365 to reach and selectively label the hCB2R-(D80N) with a high signal-to-background ratio. Thus, [F-18]-RM365 is a very promising PET radioligand for the imaging of upregulated hCB2R expression under pathological conditions.

Prostate-specific membran antigen targeting positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) in prostate cancer in France in 2023: Current use and perspectives	MEDECINE NUCLEAIRE-IMAGERIE FONCTIONNELLE ET METABOLIQUE			French	Article						Positron Emission Tomography; Prostate specific membran antigen receptor; Prostate Cancer; Staging; Biochemical recurrence; Radioligand therapy	DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; THERAPY; VERSION; RECURRENCE; MULTICENTER; METASTASES; GUIDELINES; MANAGEMENT; NOMOGRAMS; UPDATE	Prostate-specific membrane antigen targeting positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET) has become since recent years increasingly important in the management of patients with prostate cancer. Initially limited to the use in patients with prostate cancer biochemical recurrence in France, PSMA-PET is now routinely use in various setting in prostate cancer patients, on the one hand for initial staging in patients with high-risk prostate cancer, and in the other hands to assess the eligibility for radioligand therapy using PSMA ligands. Other studies are currently assessing PSMA-PET in other settings such as the characterization of prostate disease, the guidance of biopsies or even as a tool for therapeutic assessment in patients with metastatic cancer. The objective of this review is to describe the current use of PSMA-PET in France in 2023, and the perspective of PSMA-PET imaging in the management of patients with prostate cancer in the future.

In competitive inhibition studies, (-)-enantiomers [(-)-ortho-iodovesamicol ((-)-oIV), (-)-meta-iodovesamicol ((-)-mIV), (-)-vesamicol] displayed a higher affinity for VAChT than (+)-enantiomer [(+)-oIV, (+)-mIV, (+)-vesamicol]. (-)-oIV and (-)-mIV showed the same high affinity for VAChT as (-)-vesamicol. For sigma receptors(sigma-1, sigma-2), (-)-oIV (Ki = 62.2 nM (to sigma-1) and 554 nM(to (sigma-2)) showed a lower affinity than (-)-mIV (Ki = 4.5 nM (to sigma-1) and 42.9 nM (to sigma-2)). Furthermore, in a saturation binding study, (-)-[I-125]-oIV exhibited a Kd of 17.4 +/- 5.1 nM with a maximum number of binding sites, Bmax, of 559 +/- 51 fmol/mg of protein. These results showed that (-)-oIV binds to vesicular acetylcholine transporters (VAChT) more selectively than (-)-mIV, previously reported as a VAChT mapping agent, and may be suitable for VAChT imaging studies.

Characterization of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor binding site for sulfoxaflor, a new sulfoximine insecticide for the control of sap-feeding insect pests	PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Sulfoxaflor (SFX); Isoclast (TM) active; Radioligand binding; Sulfoximines; Myzus persicae (green peach aphid, GPA); Methyl-sulfoxaflor (Me-SFX)	NEONICOTINOID INSECTICIDES; HEMIPTERA; APHID; MODE	Sulfoxaflor (SFX, Isoclast (TM) Active) is a recently developed sulfoximine insecticide that is highly effective against sap-feeding insect pests. SFX has been shown to act through an interaction with insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). SFX was previously found to interact weakly with the binding site for the neonicotinoid imidacloprid. However, radioligand displacement studies characterizing the binding site of the insecticide SFX itself have not been conducted. In this study, we report the characterization of a high affinity [H-3]SFX Myzus persicae (green peach aphid, GPA) binding site with relatively low abundance. Through the evaluation of a set of SFX analogs, we have demonstrated that displacement of [H-3]SFX shows an excellent correlation with GPA toxicity, and thus is toxicologically relevant. Comparison with the previously described methyl-SFX binding site information reveals differences with the SFX binding site that are discussed herein. [H-3]SFX therefore represents a new tool for the characterization of insect nAChRs.

We report the synthesis and the chemical and pharmacological characterization of the highly stable carbamoylguanidine-type radioligand [H-3]UR-KAT479 ([H-3]23), a subtype selective histamine H-2 receptor G protein-biased agonist. [H-3]23 was characterized by saturation, kinetic, and competition binding assays at the human, guinea pig, and mouse H-2 receptors (co-)expressed in HEK293(T) cells. [H-3]23 reversibly bound to the respective H(2)Rs with moderate to high affinity (human/guinea pig/mouse Kd: 24/28/94 nM). In order to investigate the applicability of carbamoylguanidine-type ligands in animal studies elucidating the role of the H2R in the brain, we performed a preliminary partitioning experiment in the whole human/mouse blood, which indicated a low binding of [H-3]23 to red blood cells. These properties turn [H-3]23 into a powerful tool for the determination of binding affinities and demonstrate the promising pharmacokinetic profile of carbamoylguanidine-type ligands.

Objectives To summarize the current knowledge about both PSMA-PET/CT and PSMA therapy of PC. Methods The knowledge derived from the literature as well as the authors' experiences were collected in this review. Results PSMA-PET/CT demonstrates a very high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of recurrent PC as well as for the primary staging of intermediate- and high-risk PC. PSMA therapy shows promising results in third-line treatment for patients with castration-resistant, metastatic PC. Conclusions PSMA-PET/CT is meanwhile established as the gold standard for the detection of recurrent PC and is in the process of assuming the same role for primary staging of intermediate- to high-risk PC. PSMA therapy serves as a promising third-line therapy in an increasing number of centers.

Allosteric Inhibition of Serotonin 5-HT<sub>7</sub> Receptors by Zinc Ions	MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Zn; Serotonin 5-HT7 receptor; Allosteric modulation; Radioligand binding	MOLECULAR-MECHANISM; INVERSE AGONISM; BINDING-SITE; MODULATION; BRAIN; DEPRESSION; SYSTEM; ZN2+; RAT; IDENTIFICATION	The allosteric regulation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a well-known phenomenon, but there are only a few examples of allosteric modulation within the metabotropic serotonergic receptor family. Recently, we described zinc non-competitive interactions toward agonist binding at serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, in which biphasic effects, involving potentiation at sub-micromolar concentrations (10 mu M) and inhibition at sub-millimolar concentrations (500 mu M) of Zn2+ in radioligand binding assays, were consistent with both the agonist and antagonist-like effects of zinc ions observed in in vivo studies. Here, we showed new data demonstrating zinc allosteric inhibition of both agonist and antagonist binding at human recombinant 5-HT7 receptors stably expressed in HEK293 cells as observed by radioligand binding studies as well as zinc neutral antagonism displayed by the concentration of 10 mu M in the functional LANCE assay. The allosteric nature of the effect of Zn on 5-HT7 receptors was confirmed (1) in saturation studies in which zinc inhibited the binding of potent orthosteric 5-HT7 receptor radioligands, the agonist [H-3]5-CT, and the two antagonists [3H] SB-269970 and [3H] mesulergine, showing ceiling effect and differences in the magnitude of negative cooperativity (alpha = 0.15, 0.06, and 0.25, respectively); (2) in competition experiments in which 500 mu M of zinc inhibited all radioligand displacements by non-labeled orthosteric ligands (5-CT, SB-269970, and clozapine), and the most significant reduction in affinity was observed for the 5-CT agonist (4.9-16.7-fold) compared with both antagonists (1.4-3.9-fold); and (3) in kinetic experiments in which 500 mu M zinc increased the dissociation rate constants for [3H] 5-CTand [3H] mesulergine but not for [3H] SB-269970. Additionally, in the functional LANCE test using the constitutively active HEK293 cell line expressing the 5-HT7 receptor, 10 mu M zinc had features of neutral antagonism and increased the EC50 value of the 5-CT agonist by a factor of 3.2. Overall, these results showed that zinc can act as a negative allosteric inhibitor of 5-HT7 receptors. Given that the inhibiting effects of low concentrations of zinc in the functional assay represent the most likely direction of zinc activity under physiological conditions, among numerous zinc-regulated proteins, the 5-HT7 receptor can be considered a serotonergic target for zinc modulation in the CNS.

A single nucleotide polymorphism in the TSPO gene influences the binding affinity of endogenous and synthetic TSPO ligands by facilitating a lower-affinity conformation, which modifies a potential ligand binding site, ultimately leading to a binding profile classification according to each genotype. For instance, some clinical effects of the distinctive binding affinity profile of cholesterol toward the TSPO of individuals with different genotypes have been extensively discussed. Therefore, we conducted an investigation based on a radioligand binding assay, to determine the inhibition constants of some reported endogenous TSPO ligands (diazepam binding inhibitor and protoporphyrin IX), as well as synthetic ligands (disulfiram and derivatives). We observed no dependency of the polymorphism on the binding affinity of the evaluated endogenous ligands, whereas a high dependency on the binding affinity of the tested synthetic ligands was evident.

Method: Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to examine extrastriatal as well as striatal dopamine D-2 receptor occupancy in four patients treated with clozapine and three patients treated with haloperidol. The reference radioligand [C-11]raclopride was used for determination of D-2 receptor occupancy in the striatum. The radioligand [C-11]FLB 457 was chosen for determination of D-2 receptor occupancy in the thalamus, the temporal cortex. and the frontal. Results: In patients treated with haloperidol the D-2 receptor occupancy was high in all examined brain regions. In clozapine-treated patients the D-2 receptor occupancy was relatively low in both the striatum and the extrastriatal regions. Conclusions: The results from the present study give no support for the hypothesis of regional selectivity as the mechanism of action for clozapine.

Patients and Methods Forty-one patients (41) with histologically confirmed PCa were scanned using both methods. Planar imaging was performed with additional regional SPECT/CT 3 to 4 hours posttracer injection. Scans were reported as positive, negative, or equivocal. In the case of positive scans, lesions were quantified by each of the 3 reporters separately. Planar and SPECT/CT images were reported together to obtain the final report on each scan. Results Our preliminary results showed no significant difference in the detection of bone metastases between the 2 scans. Tc-99m-PSMA detected 52 of the 55 bone lesions detected on Tc-99m-MDP. However, Tc-99m-PSMA provided extra information by reporting lymph nodal metastases in 7 patients and residual disease in the prostate in 2 patients with biochemical progression after radical therapy. In 1 patient, the PSMA scan resulted in change in management with patient now on Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy. Equivocal findings were reported in 4 patients on Tc-99m-MDP and none on Tc-99m-PSMA. Conclusions Tc-99m-PSMA was comparable to Tc-99m-MDP in detection of bone metastases and demonstrated an additional benefit of providing information on visceral disease. Tc-99m-PSMA may be a better alternative to Tc-99m-MDP in staging, restaging, and assessment of patients with biochemical progression after radical therapy of PCa in a resource-limited setup like ours while also assisting to detect patients eligible for PSMA-labeled radioligand therapy.

J	Koivula, K; Rondinelli, S; Näsman, J				Koivula, Katja; Rondinelli, Sergio; Nasman, Johnny			The three-finger toxin MTα is a selective α<sub>2B</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist	TOXICON			English	Article						Adrenoceptor; Muscarinic toxin; Muscarinic receptors; Calcium mobilisation; Ligand binding	PSEUDO-NONCOMPETITIVE ANTAGONISM; MAMBA DENDROASPIS-ANGUSTICEPS; MUSCARINIC TOXINS; GREEN MAMBA; RECOMBINANT EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR; M-1; SUBTYPES; BINDING; VENOM	Muscarinic toxins (MTs) are three-finger folded peptides isolated from mamba snake venoms. In this report we describe a selective antagonistic interaction of MT alpha with the human alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor. In a functional assay, measuring the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor-induced increase in intracellular [Ca2+], we found that both venomous MT alpha and synthetic MT alpha inhibited the response in a concentration-dependent way. MT alpha did not affect the responses of alpha(2A)-, alpha(2c)-, alpha(1A)- or alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors. To further explore the binding of MT alpha to the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor, we performed ligand binding experiments on Sf9 cell homogenates with [H-3]RX821002 as reporter ligand. MT alpha bound to the receptor rather slowly requiring about 60 min to reach equilibrium. In equilibrium binding experiments, MT alpha displaced the radioligand with an IC50 of 3.2 nM, but was not able to displace all bound radioligand. Using a saturation binding protocol, we found that MT alpha suppressed the maximum binding without any greater impact on the affinity of the radioligand, indicating a non-competitive mode of inhibition. The toxin bound reversibly to alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor, but extensive washing was needed for full recovery of binding sites at high toxin concentrations. Surprisingly, MT alpha did not affect [H-3]-N-methylscopolamine binding to the muscarinic receptor subtypes at concentrations found to fully block alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors, showing that the toxin is a more potent antagonist for the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor than for muscarinic receptors. These findings should open up new views in terms of selective adrenoceptor drug design as well as in elucidation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptor physiology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Characterization of the snake venom ligand [<SUP>125</SUP>I]-DNP binding to natriuretic peptide receptor-A in human artery and potent DNP mediated vasodilatation	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						dendroaspis natriuretic peptide; human mammary artery; immunocytochemistry; radioligand binding; natriuretic; peptide receptor-A; vascular smooth muscle; vasodilatation	HEART-FAILURE; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; RENAL ACTIONS; PLASMA; SYSTEM; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; FAMILY; VOLUME	Background and purpose: The natriuretic peptides, ANP and BNP, modulate vascular smooth muscle tone in human conduit arteries. Surprisingly, the natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A) has not been visualized using radioligand binding in these vessels. A new member of this peptide family, Dendroaspis natriuretic peptide (DNP) identified from snake venom, has been proposed to be present in human plasma and endothelial cells. Also, recently a novel radioligand, [I-125]-DNP, has been characterized as selective for NPR-A in human heart. Experimental approach: Our aims were to investigate expression and function of NPR-A receptors in human mammary artery using [I-125]-DNP to quantify receptor density, immunocytochemistry to delineate the cellular distribution of the receptor and in vitro pharmacology to compare DNP induced vasodilatation to that of ANP. Key results: Saturable, sub-nanomolar affinity [I-125]-DNP binding was detected to smooth muscle of mammary artery, with receptor density of similar to 2 fmol mg(-1) protein, comparable to that of other vasoactive peptides. NPR-A immunoreactivity was localised to vascular smooth muscle cells and this was confirmed with fluorescence dual labelling. NPR-A expression was not detected in the endothelium. Like ANP, DNP fully reversed the constrictor response to ET-1 in endothelium intact or denuded mammary artery, with comparable nanomolar potencies. Conclusions and Implications: This is the first characterization of NPR-A in human mammary artery using [I-125]-DNP and we provide evidence for the presence of receptor protein on vascular smooth muscle cells, but not endothelial cells. This implies that the observed vasodilatation is predominantly mediated via direct activation of smooth muscle NPR- A.

GSK1482160, a P2X7R modulator with nanomolar binding affinity and high selectivity, has been successfully radiolabeled and utilized for imaging P2X7 levels in a mouse model of lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic inflammation. In the current study, we further characterized its binding profile and determined whether [C-11]GSK1482160 can detect changes in P2X7R expression in a rodent model of multiple sclerosis.Methods[C-11]GSK1482160 was synthesized with high specific activity and high radiochemical purity. Radioligand saturation and competition binding assays were performed for [C-11]GSK1482160 using HEK293-hP2X7R living cells. Micro-PET studies were carried out in nonhuman primates. In vitro autoradiography and immunohistochemistry studies were then carried out to evaluate tracer uptake and P2X7 expression in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat lumbar spinal cord at EAE-peak and EAE-remitting stages compared with sham rats.Results[C-11]GSK1482160 binds to HEK293-hP2X7R living cells with high binding affinity (K-d=5.090.98nmol/l, K-i=2.63 +/- 0.6nmol/l). Micro-PET studies showed high tracer retention and a homogeneous distribution in the brain of nonhuman primates. In the EAE rat model, tracer uptake of [C-11]GSK1482160 in rat lumbar spinal cord was the highest at the EAE-peak stage (277.74 +/- 79.74PSL/mm(2)), followed by the EAE-remitting stage(149.00 +/- 54.14PSL/mm(2)) and sham (66.37 +/- 1.48PSL/mm(2)). The tracer uptake correlated strongly with P2X7-positive cell counts, activated microglia numbers, and disease severity.ConclusionWe conclude that [C-11]GSK1482160 has the potential for application in monitoring neuroinflammation.

Therapeutic doses of buspirone block D3 receptors in the living primate brain	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Addiction; buspirone; dopamine receptors; 6'-hydroxybuspirone	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOPAMINE D-3 RECEPTOR; HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; IN-VIVO; ACTIVE METABOLITE; DRUG-ADDICTION; COCAINE; BINDING; PHARMACOKINETICS; RADIOTRACER	Dopamine D-3 receptor (D3R) antagonists may be effective medications for multiple substance use disorders (SUDs). However, no selective D3R antagonists are currently available for clinical testing. Buspirone, originally characterized as a 5-HT1A partial agonist and used as an anxiolytic, also binds to D3R and D4R with high affinity, with lower affinity to D2R, and interferes with cocaine reward. Here we used PET with [C-11]PHNO (D3R-preferring radioligand), [C-11]raclopride (D2R/D3R radioligand) and [C-11]NNC-112 (D1R radioligand) to measure occupancy of oral and parenteral buspirone in the primate brain. Intramuscular buspirone (0.19 and 0.5 mg/kg) blocked both [C-11]PHNO and [C-11] raclopride binding to striatum, exhibiting high occupancy (50-85%) at 15 min and rapid wash-out over 2-6 h. In contrast, oral buspirone (3 mg/kg) significantly blocked [C-11]PHNO binding in D-3-rich regions (globus pallidum and midbrain) at 3 h, but had minimal effects on [C-11]raclopride binding (28-37% at 1 h and 10% at 3 h). Buspirone did not block [C-11]NNC-112. Our findings provide evidence that i.m. buspirone blocks D3R and D2R, whereas oral buspirone is more selective towards D3R blockade in vivo, consistent with extensive first pass metabolism and supporting the hypothesis that its metabolites (5- and 6'-hydroxybuspirone) merit evaluation for treating SUDs. They also indicate that for oral buspirone to achieve greater than 80% sustained D3R occupancy, as might be needed to treat addiction, higher doses (at least three-fold) than those used to treat anxiety (maximal 60 mg) will be required. Nonetheless, based on previous clinical studies, these doses would be safe and well tolerated.

After i.v. injection, [C-11]SL25.1188 presented a rapid phase of distribution in blood (about 5 min), followed by a T-1/2 elimination of 85 +/- 14 min. Plasma metabolism analysis showed that [C-11]SL25.1188 is stable in vivo at least for 30 min. Brain uptake was rapid with the highest one observed in the striatum and thalamus, and the lowest in the pons. Calculated distribution volumes (V-T) were as follows: striatum = 10.3, thalamus = 10.9, hippocampus = 8.9, temporal cortex = 7.7, occipital cortex = 7.2, parietal cortex = 7.4, frontal cortex = 7.4, white matter = 7.4, and pons = 6.1. Pretreatment with deprenyl (2 mg/kg, i.v.) or lazabemide (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced V-T values in all brain areas up to 50%. In displacement experiments, injection of SL25.1188 or deprenyl (1 and 2 mg/kg, i.v., respectively) strongly reduced the specific uptake of [C-11]SL25.1188 in all brain areas (85-100%), while a lesser displacement was observed with lazabemide (0.5 mg/kg, i.v.) (55-70% of specific binding depending on the brain area). Therefore, [C-11]SL25.1188 is characterized in vivo by reversible binding, high brain uptake and very slow plasma metabolism, strongly suggesting that this radioligand is a potent tool for the in vivo study of brain MAO-B.

This is in contrast to many other chemokine receptor antagonists, where the mechanism of antagonism has been described as allosteric. Experimental approach: To determine whether it displays a unique mechanism among the chemokine receptor antagonists, the mode of action of SB265610 was investigated at the CXCR2 receptor using radioligand and [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding approaches in addition to chemotaxis of human neutrophils. Key results: In equilibrium saturation binding studies, SB265610 depressed the maximal binding of [I-125]-interleukin-8 ([I-125]-IL-8) without affecting the K-d. In contrast, IL-8 was unable to prevent binding of [H-3]-SB265610. Kinetic binding experiments demonstrated that this was not an artefact of irreversible or slowly reversible binding. In functional experiments, SB265610 caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curves to IL-8 and growth-related oncogene alpha, but also a reduction in maximal response elicited by each agonist. Fitting these data to an operational allosteric ternary complex model suggested that, once bound, SB265610 completely blocks receptor activation. SB265610 also inhibited basal [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding in this preparation. Conclusions and implications: Taken together, these data suggest that SB265610 behaves as an allosteric inverse agonist at the CXCR2 receptor, binding at a region distinct from the agonist binding site to prevent receptor activation, possibly by interfering with G protein coupling.

However, the injection of a radiolabeled P-blocker results in a pulmonary PET signal that reflects the binding of the ligand in the alveoli and not in the airways. Better discrimination between alveolar and airway beta-adrenoceptors may be possible with an inhaled radioligand. Design: A nebulizer was used to administer the antagonist S-C-11-CGP12388 in aerosol form. Eight volunteers inhaled the tracer twice, at baseline and after pretreatment with a beta-adrenergic drug. In both PET scan studies, a dynamic scan of the lungs was followed by a whole-body scan to assess the inhaled dose. Pulmonary uptake was quantified using a region-of-interest-based analysis. Setting: University hospital. Participants: Healthy volunteers. Interventions: Pretreatment consisted either of inhaled salbutamol (400 mu g, 20 min before the scan), or orally administered pindolol (3 X 5 mg during a period of 16 h before PET scanning). Results: Drug pretreatment did not affect pulmonary deposition of the radioligand. The agonist salbutamol accelerated the monoexponential washout of C-11 not only in the peripheral lung (mainly alveoli), but also in the central lung (mainly airways) and in the main bronchi. An even larger increase of the washout rate was induced by the antagonist pindolol. Conclusion: The similar effects of pindolol and salbutamol on tracer kinetics suggest that accelerated washout is due to the blockade of beta-adrenoceptors. Thus, the interaction of drugs with airway beta-adrenoceptors can be visualized using PET scanning and an inhaled radioligand.

We previously proposed a non-invasive simultaneous estimation (nSIME) method that quantifies binding of a PET radioligand by combining individual electronic health records information and a pharmacokinetic AIF (PK-AIF) model. Initially applied only to [C-11]DASB data, in this study we validate nSIME for a different radioligand, [F-18]FDG, adapting the algorithm to the specific distribution and metabolism of this radioligand. We evaluate the impact of the PK-AIF model, the number of [F-18]FDG-specific soft constraints, and the type of predictive strategy. The accuracy of nSIME is then compared to a population-based approach. All analyses are conducted on 67 [F-18]FDG PET scans with arterial blood data available for comparison. nSIME performance is optimal for [F-18]FDG when using the PK-AIF model, two soft constraints, and an aggregate model to predict the soft constraint values. Higher correlation and lower Bland-Altman spread against gold standard rCMRglu values based on arterial blood measurements are observed for nSIME (r 0.83, spread 1.55) compared to the population-based approach (r 0.77, spread 2.12). nSIME provides a data-driven estimation of both amplitude and shape of the AIF curve at the individual level and potentially enables non-invasive quantification of PET data across radioligands, avoiding the need for arterial blood sampling.

Relatively higher concentration of [H-3]paroxetine was detected in the whole brain (minus cerebellum) than in the plasma of mice after the i.v. injection of the radioligand, and the half-life (t(1/2)) of elimination was much slower. The in vivo specific [H-3]paroxetine binding in the mouse brain after the i.v. injection was defined as the difference of particulate-bound radioactivity between the whole brain and cerebellum, and it was dose-dependently attenuated by oral or intraperitoneal administration of fluoxetine (8.68-116 mumol/kg). Furthermore, oral administration of fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline at the pharmacologically relevant doses reduced sigificantly (25-94%) in vivo specific [H-3]paroxetine binding in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, thalamus and midbrain of mice, and their significant decreases were observed up to at least 8 h (fluvoxamine), 24 h (fluoxetine), and 12 h (paroxetine and sertraline) later. The value of area under the curve (AUC) for decrease in [H-3]paroxetine binding vs. time in each brain region was largest for fluoxetine among these SSRIs, due to the relatively longer-lasting occupation of brain serotonin transporter. The AUC value in mouse brain after oral administration of each SSRI was 1.2-3.2 times greater in the thalamus and midbrain than in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. Thus, the present study has revealed that [H-3]paroxetine may be a suitable radioligand for in vivo characterization of brain binding sites and pharmacological effects of SSRIs.

In general, compounds of all three series exhibit similar HCA2 binding and activation profile. However, the activity is strongly dependent on the substituent at the aromatic part of the structure. Among the structures evaluated, the highest affinity and potency in all series were exhibited by compounds containing 4-hydroxy and/or 2-chloro or 2-fluoro substituents. The most active compounds in the enyne and but-1-yne series in the cAMP assay are 2-fluoro, 4-hydroxy and 2-chloro, 4-hydroxy phenyl derivatives 2f, 4f, and 4g showing potency similar to the previously described 4-hydroxy-biphenyl analogue 5c.

An 18-kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) polymorphism explains differences in binding affinity of the PET radioligand PBR28	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Ala147Thr; PBR28; polymorphism; radioligand binding; TSPO	18 KDA; NEUROINFLAMMATION; MICROGLIA; BRAIN	[(11)C] PBR28 binds the 18-kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) and is used in positron emission tomography (PET) to detect microglial activation. However, quantitative interpretations of signal are confounded by large interindividual variability in binding affinity, which displays a trimodal distribution compatible with a codominant genetic trait. Here, we tested directly for an underlying genetic mechanism to explain this. Binding affinity of PBR28 was measured in platelets isolated from 41 human subjects and tested for association with polymorphisms in TSPO and genes encoding other proteins in the TSPO complex. Complete agreement was observed between the TSPO Ala147Thr genotype and PBR28 binding affinity phenotype (P value =3.1x10(-13)). The TSPO Ala147Thr polymorphism predicts PBR28 binding affinity in human platelets. As all second-generation TSPO PET radioligands tested hitherto display a trimodal distribution in binding affinity analogous to PBR28, testing for this polymorphism may allow quantitative interpretation of TSPO PET studies with these radioligands.

There is also evidence that A(1)ARs are involved in brain pathologies, including cerebral ischemia, epilepsy, and neurodegeneration. Therefore, measuring A(1)ARs in the living brain has been a long-standing goal. This report describes the preclinical evaluation of (18)F-8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine ((18)F-CPFPX), a novel A(1)AR PET ligand. Methods: CPFPX, a xanthine-based A(1)AR antagonist, was labeled with either (18)F or (3)H, maintaining identical chemical structures, and evaluated in rats as a putative radioligand for in vivo or in vitro imaging of brain A(1)ARs by quantitative receptor autoradiography and the combination of high-resolution small animal PET and MRI. Results: (3)H-CPFPX bound with nanomolar affinity (K(d), 4.4 nmol/L) to A(1)ARs and showed a distribution typical of cerebral A(1)ARs. In extensive in vitro competition studies, (3)H-CPFPX proved to be a highly selective and specific A(1)AR radioligand. Neither the nonxanthine-type adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist ZM 241385 nor multiple cholinergic, serotoninergic, and glutamatergic receptor compounds competed for (3)H-CPFPX below the micromolar level. In vivo animal PET and ex vivo autoradiographic experiments measured radioactivity in discrete brain regions after intravenous injection of (18)F-CPFPX. (18)F-CPFPX had excellent in vivo stability and penetrated the blood-brain barrier immediately after injection due to its high lipophilicity. Brain uptake was rapid and particularly high in gray matter regions. Retention of (18)F-CPFPX was highest in the cerebellum, thalamus, and neocortex with evidence of saturable binding. Low binding potentials were found in the midbrain. In vivo displacement PET experiments with the A(1)AR antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine showed a 72% +/- 8% displacement of (18)F-CPFPX. Conclusion: (18)F-CPFPX is a highly selective and specific ligand for A(1)ARs and a suitable radioligand for noninvasive PET imaging of A(1)ARs in the living brain. These studies also support the application of high-resolution animal PET as an effective in vivo imaging tool in the evaluation process of new radioligands.

Positron emission tomography (PET) offers a way of assess -ing receptor function non-invasively in humans, but there are no PET radioligands for assessing myocardial alpha-adrenoceptors. GB67, a structural and pharmacological analogue of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, was labelled with positron-emitting carbun-11 (t(1/2)=20.4 min) by C-11-methylation of N-desmethylamido-GB67 (GB99). [C-11]GB67 was injected intravenously into conscious nts, Serial arterial blood samples were taken. Rats were killed and tissues removed to determine radioactivity. The percentages of unchanged [C-11]GB67 and its radioactive metabolites in plasma and tissues were assessed by HPLC, Plasma clearance of radioactivity was rapid. Myocardial uptake was maximal at 1-2 min and decreased slowly during 60 min. Predosing with adrenoceptor antagonists demonstrated selectivity for myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. GB67 and prazosin blocked uptake of radioactivity; the non-selective antagonist, phentolamine, partially blocked uptake; the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, RX 821002, only blocked uptake at high dose and the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, CGP 12177, had no effect. Additionally, injection of prazosin at 20 min after radioligand displaced radioactivity. In vivo competition curves obtained by injecting [C-11]GB67 with varying amounts of either unlabelled GB67 or its precursor GB99 were fitted to a competitive binding model to provide estimates of the maximum number of binding sites (B-max) and half saturation doses (K) for myocardium. Assuming a tissue protein content of 10%, the values of B-max [similar to 13 pmol.(g tissue)(-1)] were similar to those [50-170 fmol(mg protein)(-1)] reported for myocardial al-adrenoceptors assessed in vitro. Both GB67 and its precursor GB99 had high affinity for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors [K-GB67=1.5 nmol.(kg body weight)(-1), K-GB99=4.8 nmol . (kg body weight)(-1)]. HPLC demonstrated four radioactive metabolites in plasma. [C-11]GB67 was 80% of the radioactivity at 5 min and 50% at 45 min. No radioactive metabolites were detected in myocardium up to 60 min after injection. [C-11]GB67 was assessed in two male human volunteers. PET demonstrated high myocardial uptake. The profile of radioactive metabolites in plasma was comparable to that in the rat, although metabolism was slower in humans. Thus, [C-11]GB67 is a promising radioligand for assessing alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in human myocardium with PET.

Fenfluramine-induced changes in 5-HT1B occupancy were compared to those obtained by self-block with unlabeled P943. Two baboons and 1 rhesus monkey were given preblocking or displacing doses of fenfluramine (1-5 mg/kg) or preblocking doses of unlabeled P943 (0.2 mg/kg) and imaged with [C-11]P943 PET. Receptor occupancy by the low dose of fenfluramine (1 mg/kg) in the baboons was 25 and 29% and by the high dose of fenfluramine (5 mg/kg) in the rhesus macaque was 42%. Receptor occupancy by P943 (0.2 mg/kg) was 68 and 86% in the baboons. PET imaging of 5-HT1B receptors with [C-11]P943 may be a useful approach for measuring changes in endogenous 5-HT in the living human brain. Synapse 65:1113-1117, 2011. (C) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In the radioligand binding studies of [I-125]iodocyanopindolol with COS-7 cell membranes that transiently expressed human beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) subtypes, SWR-0315NA exhibited 1-fold and 2-fold greater binding affinities for beta(3)-AR than those for beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs, respectively. The maximal stimulatory effects of SWR-0315NA on cAMP accumulation in CHO cells expressing all the beta-AR subtypes were 79%, 3% and 93% for beta(1)-, beta(2)- and beta(3)-ARs of those produced by (-)-isoproterenol, respectively. SWR-0315NA has 26.3-fold and more than 630-fold greater selectivity for beta(3)-AR than those for beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs in potency, respectively. These results indicate that although SWR-0315NA has lower binding selectivity towards beta-AR subtypes, it is a selective agonist with high intrinsic activity for beta(3)-AR as compared with (-)-isoproterenol.

PET imaging of M4 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) allows qualification of the distribution as well as the expression of this receptor under physiological conditions and thereby helps to assess the receptor occupancy (RO) of a drug candidate. In this study, our aims were (a) to synthesize a novel M4 PAM PET radioligand [11C]PF06885190 (b) to evaluate the brain distribution of [C-11]PF06885190 in nonhuman primates (NHP) and (c) to analyze its radiometabolites in the blood plasma of NHP. Radiolabeling of [C-11]PF06885190 was accomplished via N-methylation of the precursor. Six PET measurements were performed using two male cynomolgus monkeys, where three PET measurements were at baseline, two after pretreatment with a selective M4 PAM compound CVL-231 and one after pretreatment with donepezil. The total volume of distribution (V-T) of [C-11]PF06885190 was examined using Logan graphical analysis with arterial input function. Radiometabolites were analyzed in monkey blood plasma using gradient HPLC system. Radiolabeling of [C-11]PF06885190 was successfully accomplished and the radioligand was found to be stable in the formulation, with radiochemical purity exceeding 99% 1 h after the end of the synthesis. [C-11]PF06885190 was characterized in the cynomolgus monkey brain where a moderate brain uptake was found at the baseline condition. However, it showed fast wash-out as it dropped to half of the peak at around 10 min. Change of V-T from baseline was around -10% after pretreatment with a M4 PAM, CVL-231. Radiometabolite studies showed relatively fast metabolism. Although sufficient brain uptake of [C-11]PF06885190 was observed, these data suggest that [C-11]PF06885190 might have too low specific binding in the NHP brain to be further applied in PET imaging.

Brain uptake was high in the striatum (17 and 13% ID/100 mL tissue in the putamen and the caudate, respectively), moderate in the midbrain and thalamus (5 and 3% ID/100 mL tissue, respectively), and low in the cortex and cerebellum (2% ID/100 mL tissue) at 30 min post injection. The striatum-to-cerebellum ratio was high (30 at 110 min post injection). Specific binding was completely blocked following pretreatment with the DAT antagonists GBR12909 (5 mg/kg i.v.) or PE2I (1 mg/kg i.v.). The [C-11]LBT-999 uptake was decreased by these antagonists in the putamen (-79 and -92%, respectively), caudate (-80 and -91%, respectively), midbrain (-73 and -78%, respectively), and thalamus (-34 and -46%, respectively). The serotonin transporter (SERT) antagonist citalopram (5 mg/kg i.v.) or the norepinephrine transporter antagonist maprotiline (5 mg/kg i.v.) had no effect on LBT specific binding. Pharmacological challenge with PE2I (1 mg/kg i.v.) induced a rapid and almost complete decrease of the specific binding in the putamen (-97%), caudate (-96%), midbrain (-96%), and thalamus (-81%), confirming the reversibility of [C-11]LBT-999 binding. The high brain uptake of [C-11]LBT-999 together with its low nonspecific binding (reflected by the very high brain structure-to-cerebellum ratio) indicate that this radio-tracer is an excellent candidate for in vivo quantification of the DAT, especially in extra-striatal structures, such as the midbrain.

This is found in compound A (N-[2-[4-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl) phenyl]ethyl]-2-[(2R)-1-(2-napthylsulfonyl)-3-oxo-1,2,3,4tetrahydroquinoxalin-2-yl]acetamide), a very potent and selective B-1 receptor antagonist. A subset of specific bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonists (LF16-0687, bradyzide and derivatives) possesses a similar 'scaffold' (phenyl-SO2-NR-CRR-CO-NRR). We investigated whether simple molecules mimicking the postulated pharmacophores could be identified in two public chemical databases. Receptor binding to B-1 and B-2 receptors expressed by rabbit cultured smooth-muscle cells was confirmed for some of these newly identified agents, with a loss of receptor subtype selectivity. For instance, compound 3[2-(3-oxo-1-(toluene-4-sulfonyl)-1,2,3,4- 4H-quinoxalin-2- yl)-N-phenyl-acetamide] exhibits IC50 values of 2.13 and 126 mu M in the radioligand competition assays for B-1 and B-2 receptors, respectively, and a pA(2) of 6.27 at the rabbit B-1 receptor in a functional test (Lys-des-Arg(9)-bradykin-ininduced contractility of the isolated aorta). Compound 5 (a close analog of compound 3) is a more balanced dual antagonist of low potency (IC50 values of 30 and 117 mu M, respectively). As predicted, compounds modeled on a postulated pharmacophore common to some non-peptide B-1 or B-2 receptor antagonists exhibit measurable binding with decreased receptor subtype selectivity. Dual B-1/B-2 receptor antagonists are of possible therapeutic interest and should be developed.

Here we report the results of quantitative PET studies of cerebral nAChRs with 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 (2-[F-18]FA) in rhesus monkeys. Data from dynamic PET scans were analyzed using graphical methods. Binding potential (BP) values of 2.0, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.03 observed in the thalamus (Th), cortex (Cx), striatum (Str), and cerebellum (Cb), respectively, were consistent with the pattern of alpha(4)beta(2), nAChR distribution in monkey brain. The high value of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding in the rhesus monkey Th and low level of that in Cb compared with nonspecific accumulation of radioactivity in these structures allowed use of Cb as a reference region for calculation of BP and volume of distribution of specific binding (VDsb) in Th by graphical methods, both with and without the plasma input function. In contrast, estimation of 2[F-18]FA specific binding in low-receptor-density regions such as Cx and Str required assessment of nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VDnd) in a separate study and measurement of nonmetabolized radioligand concentrations in the plasma. For accurate quantitation of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding by graphical analysis, PET studies should last up to 7 h due to the slow kinetics of 2[F-18]FA brain distribution. Further, to avoid substantial underestimation in measured BP values the doses of administered 2-[F-18]FA should not exceed 0.1 nmol/kg body weight. The findings suggest that 2-[F-18]FA is a promising ligand for quantitation of nAChRs in human brain.

Kinetic profiling of novel spirobenzo-oxazinepiperidinone derivatives as equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 inhibitors	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article; Early Access						Target binding kinetics; (Human) nucleoside transport protein (hENT1; Radioligand binding experiments; Transport inhibitors; Adenosine	TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; BINDING-KINETICS; EXPRESSION; PHARMACOLOGY; CONSTANT; ENT1	Evaluation of kinetic parameters of drug-target binding, k(on), k(off), and residence time (RT), in addition to the traditional in vitro parameter of affinity is receiving increasing attention in the early stages of drug discovery. Target binding kinetics emerges as a meaningful concept for the evaluation of a ligand's duration of action and more generally drug efficacy and safety. We report the biological evaluation of a novel series of spirobenzo-oxazinepiperidinone derivatives as inhibitors of the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1, SLC29A1). The compounds were evaluated in radioligand binding experiments, i.e., displacement, competition association, and washout assays, to evaluate their affinity and binding kinetic parameters. We also linked these pharmacological parameters to the compounds' chemical characteristics, and learned that separate moieties of the molecules governed target affinity and binding kinetics. Among the 29 compounds tested, 28 stood out with high affinity and a long residence time of 87 min. These findings reveal the importance of supplementing affinity data with binding kinetics at transport proteins such as hENT1.

Nicotine-Induced Upregulation of Native Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors Is Caused by Multiple Mechanisms	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; PHYSIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY; CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS; ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN; H-3 ACETYLCHOLINE; CHRONIC EXPOSURE; BINDING-SITES; SUBUNIT; BRAIN; EXPRESSION	Nicotine causes changes in brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) during smoking that initiate addiction. Nicotine-induced upregulation is the long-lasting increase in nAChR radioligand binding sites in brain resulting from exposure. The mechanisms causing upregulation are not established. Many different mechanisms have been reported with the assumption that there is a single underlying cause. Using live rat cortical neurons, we examined for the first time how exposure and withdrawal of nicotine shape the kinetics of native alpha 4 beta 2-containing nAChR upregulation in real time. Upregulation kinetics demonstrates that at least two different mechanisms underlie this phenomenon. First, a transient upregulation occurs that rapidly reverses, faster than nAChR degradation, and corresponds to nAChR conformational changes as assayed by conformational-dependent, subunit-specific antibodies. Second, a long-lasting process occurs correlating with increases in nAChR numbers caused by decreased proteasomal subunit degradation. Previous radioligand binding measurements to brain tissue have measured the second process and largely missed the first. We conclude that nicotine-induced upregulation is composed of multiple processes occurring at different rates with different underlying causes.

For each assay, insulin-extracted serum samples were incubated with radiolabeled insulin in the presence and absence of high levels of unlabeled insulin to determine nonspecific binding and total binding, respectively. To measure total IAB, antibody-bound insulin was precipitated with a polyethylene glycol solution, washed, and counted in a gamma-counter. To measure IgG IAB, samples were treated with protein G-Sepharose beads, centrifuged, washed, and counted. For the measurement of IgA, IgE, and IgM IAB, IgG was removed from the samples and treated with anti-IgA, -IgE, or -IgM conjugated to Sepharose beads, centrifuged, washed, and counted. The acid/charcoal extraction of bound and unbound insulin from serum samples was optimized. Specificity and binding capacity of the protein G and antibody-bound beads were evaluated and optimized. The linear region of the total and IgG IAB assays was determined using serum samples containing high levels of insulin antibodies. The limit of quantitation, limit of detection, and precision for all the assays were also determined.

In vitro radioligand competition binding assays showed that all the ligands exhibited low nanomolar affinity for sigma(1) receptors (K-i(sigma(1))=1.22-2.14nM) and extremely high subtype selectivity (K-i(sigma(2))=830-1710nM; K-i(sigma(2))/K-i(sigma(1))=680-887). [F-18]9 was prepared in 42-46% isolated radiochemical yield, with a radiochemical purity of >99% by HPLC analysis after purification, via nucleophilic F-18(-) substitution of the corresponding tosylate precursor. Biodistribution studies in mice demonstrated high initial brain uptakes and high brain-to-blood ratios. Administration of SA4503 or haloperidol 5min prior to injection of [F-18]9 significantly reduced the accumulation of radiotracers in organs known to contain sigma(1) receptors. Two radioactive metabolites were observed in the brain at 30min after radiotracer injection. [F-18]9 may serve as a lead compound to develop suitable radiotracers for sigma(1) receptor imaging with positron emission tomography.

Although both radioligands showed similar radiochemical amenability, [F-18]FPEB PET showed higher brain uptake and superior binding potential values than those of [F-18] FDEGPECO PET (peak brain uptakes in the hippocampus and the striatum: 7.2-8.7 vs. 5.0-6.2, BPND: 7.3-9.6 vs. 0.3-0.4 for [F-18]FPEB and [F-18]FDEGPECO, respectively). In addition, the target-to-reference ratios for [F-18]FPEB is >4 fold than those of [F-18]FDEGPECO. From this evidence, we conclude that [F-18]FPEB is a superior radioligand for mGlu5 imaging in preclinical studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Agonist binding affinities showed correlation coefficients near unity in comparing human, dog, rat, and guinea pig cerebral cortical histamine H-3 receptors. Antagonist binding affinities revealed lower correlations fur human compared to dog, rat, or guinea pig, suggesting species-based pharmacological differences. The functional potencies of histamine H-3 receptor antagonists in field-stimulated guinea pig ileum were highly correlated to binding affinities for guinea pig, dog, and, to a lesser extent, rat cerebral cortex. However, antagonist binding affinity at human cerebral cortex did not correlate well with guinea pig ileum functional potency, These results suggest significant interspecies histamine H-3 receptor heterogeneity, consistent with recent receptor gene sequence data. Therefore, genetic heterogeneity, rather than peripheral and central histamine H-3 receptor diversity, is responsible for the pharmacological differences observed. (C), 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

For patients with symptomatic bone metastases without visceral metastases, the guidelines recommend radionuclide therapy with Ra-223-dichloride as a single therapeutic agent or in combination with hormone therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of repeated cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 after exposure to more cycles of Ra-223. Forty-nine patients were treated with three cycles of Lu-PSMA-617 divided into two groups subjected to a history of therapy with Ra-223. Group 1 included 20 patients, who had received therapy with Ra-223 prior to Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. Group 2, which was the control group regarding hematotoxicity, comprised 29 patients without any history of a bone-targeted radionuclide therapy. No CTC 4 degrees hematotoxicity was observed in the entire study population. There was no CTC 3 degrees or CTC 4 degrees leucopenia in either group. One and three patients from group 1 and 2, respectively, showed CTC 3 degrees anemia. In group 1 there was significantly more CTC 2 degrees anemia (50% vs. 6.9%) (p = 0.008). One patient from group 1 (5%) showed a CTC 3 degrees thrombocytopenia without any concurrent anemia, and two patients from group 2 (7%) showed a CTC 3 degrees thrombocytopenia, one with CTC 3 degrees anemia and one without any anemia. There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. These results confirmed that performing repeated cycles of Lu-PSMA-617 after Ra-223 seems to be safe with a very small probability of hematotoxicity.

Labelling with fluorine-18 was performed in one single step (chlorine/bromine-for-fluorine heteroaromatic substitution) using a Zymate-XP robotic system affording HPLC-purified, ready-to-inject, 6-[F-18] fluoro-PBR28 (> 95% radiochemically pure). Non-decay-corrected overall yields were 9-10% and specific radioactivities ranged from 74 to 148 GBq/mu mol. In vitro binding experiments, dynamic mu PET studies performed in a rat model of acute neuroinflammation (unilaterally, AMPA-induced, striatum-lesioned rats) and ex vivo autoradiography on the same model demonstrated the potential of 6-[F-18] fluoro-PBR28 to image the TSPO 18 kDa using PET.

The aim of this work was to evaluate whether CgA can serve as a response predictor for Lu-177-prostate-specific membrane antigen 617 (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT) in comparison with the established tumor markers. Methods: One hundred consecutive patients with metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer scheduled for PSMA RLT were evaluated for prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and CgA at baseline and in follow-up of PSMA RLT. Tumor uptake of PSMA ligand, a known predictive marker for response, was assessed as a control variable. Results: From the 100 evaluated patients, 35 had partial remission, 16 stable disease, 15 mixed response, and 36 progression of disease. Tumor uptake above salivary gland uptake translated into partial remission, with an odds ratio (OR) of 60.265 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.038-720.922). Elevated LDH implied a reduced chance for partial remission, with an OR of 0.094 (95% CI, 0.017-0.518), but increased the frequency of progressive disease (OR, 2.717; 95% CI, 1.391-5.304). All patients who achieved partial remission had a normal baseline LDH. Factor-2 elevation of CgA increased the risk for progression, with an OR of 3.089 (95% CI, 1.302-7.332). Baseline PSA had no prognostic value for response prediction. Conclusion: In our cohort, baseline PSA had no prognostic value for response prediction. LDH was the marker with the strongest prognostic value, and elevated LDH increased the risk for progression of disease under PSMA RLT. Elevated CgA demonstrated a moderate impact as a negative prognostic marker in general but was explicitly related to the presence of liver metastases. Well in line with the literature, sufficient tumor uptake is a prerequisite to achieve tumor response.

Since the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is a promising molecular target for inflammation, we evaluated the potential value of the F-18-labeled tracer F-18-PTTP (5-{[2-Chloro-3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] carbonyl}-1-pyrimidin-2-yl-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-[1,2,3]triazolo[4,5-c] pyridin) for targeting P2X7Rs and thus differentiating inflammation from tumors. Methods: The radioligand F-18-PTTP was achieved by a 1-step F-18-trifluoromethylation reaction. The binding affinity of the ligand for P2X7R and its stability were evaluated in vitro. Blood pharmacokinetics tests and biodistribution studies were performed in vivo. Dynamic F-18-PTTP small-animal PET/CT imaging was performed for 60 min on A549 tumor-bearing mice and inflammation-model mice for targeting differentiation. Results: F-18-PTTP was afforded with decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 2.5%-7.0%, specific activity of 296-370 MBq/mu mol, and radiochemical purity over 95%. F-18-PTTP showed excellent stability in 0.9% NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, good affinity to RAW264.7 cells, and rapid blood clearance in mice. In inflammation-model mice, uptake of F-18-PTTP peaked at 5 min after injection and kept at an imageable level till 30 min, whereas no significant radioactivity uptake was found in tumor grafts till 1 h after injection. The specificity of F-18-PTTP was verified by blocking studies and histologic analysis. Conclusion: The current study provides compelling data that F-18-PTTP is a novel radioligand targeting P2X7R and has potential to screen new drugs, quantify peripheral inflammation, and distinguish inflammation from certain solid tumors.

Synthesis and evaluation of <SUP>18</SUP>F-labeled 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonists as PET ligands	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PET; Fluorine-18; 5-HT2AR; Agonist; Cimbi-36	EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RADIOLIGAND; AFFINITY; RELEASE; BINDING	Introduction: The serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is the most abundant excitatory 5-HT receptor in the human brain and implicated in various brain disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to image specific proteins and processes in the human brain and several 5-HT2AR PET antagonist radioligands are available. In contrast to an antagonist radioligand, an agonist radioligand should be able to image the population of functional receptors, i.e., those capable of inducing neuroreceptor signaling. Recently, we successfully developed and validated the first 5-HT2AR agonist PET tracer, [C-11]Cimbi-36, for neuroimaging in humans and herein disclose some of our efforts to develop an F-18-labeled 5-HT2AR agonist PET-ligand. Methods and results: Three fluorine containing derivatives of Cimbi-36 were synthesized and found to be potent 5-HT2A agonists. F-18-labeling of the appropriate precursors was performed using [F-18]FETos, typically yielding 0.2-2.0 GBq and specific activities of 40-120 GBq/mu mol. PET studies in Danish landrace pigs revealed that [F-18]1 displayed brain uptake in 5-HT2AR rich regions. However, high uptake in bone was also observed. No blocking effect was detected during a competition experiment with a 5-HT2AR selective antagonist. [F-18]2 and [F-18]3 showed very low brain uptake. Conclusion: None of the investigated F-18-labeled Cimbi-36 derivatives [F-18]1, [F-18]2 and [F-18]3 show suitable tracer characteristics for in vivo PET neuroimaging of the 5-HT2AR. Although for [F-18]1 there was reasonable brain uptake, we suggest that a large proportion radioactivity in the brain was due to radiometabolites, which would explain why it could not be displaced by a 5-HT2AR antagonist.

Scatchard analysis of saturation isotherms revealed two different populations of binding sites. NCS-382 was about 10 times more potent than GHB in inhibiting [H-3]NCS-382 binding. A variety of ligands for other receptors did not affect [H-3]NCS-382 binding. Quantitative autoradiographic analysis of [H-3]NCS-382 binding revealed similar characteristics. Thus [3H]NCS-382, being more potent and selective, offers advantage over [3H]GHB as a radioligand. Unlike GHB, several analogues of GHB such as UMB68 (a tertiary alcohol analogue of GHB), UMB86 (4-hydroxy-4-napthylbutanoic acid, sodium salt), UMB72 [4-(3-phenylpropyloxy)butyric acid, sodium salt], UMB73 (4-benzyloxybutyric acid, sodium salt), UMB66 (3-chloropropanoic acid), gamma-hydroxyvaleric acid (that is, GHV, a 4-methyl-substituted analogue of GHB), 3-HPA (3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid), and ethers of 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid (UMB108, UMB109, and UMB119) displaced [3H]NCS-382 without affecting [H-3]GABA binding to GABA(B) receptor. Thus these compounds offer an advantage over GHB as an experimental tool. Our study, aimed at exploring the potential involvement of the GHB receptor in the pharmacology of ethanol, indicated that ethanol does not affect [H-3]NCS-382 binding in the rat brain, thereby suggesting that ethanol does not interact directly with the GHB receptor. Our study, aimed at exploring the involvement of the GHB receptor in the pathology of succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency, which is known to cause elevation of GHB levels, revealed no change in the affinity, receptor density or displacement potency as determined by using [H-3]NCS-382 as a radioligand in Aldh5a1(-/-) vs. Aldh5a1(+/+) mouse brain.

In this study, we report the efficacy and safety of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 augmented [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in Lu-177-naive mCRPC patients (n = 15) with poor prognosis (presence of visceral metastases, high total tumor burden with diffuse bone metastases or a short PSA doubling time of <2 months). Biochemical (by PSA serum value) and molecular imaging response (by [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT) was assessed after two cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT, with at least one [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 augmentation. In addition, PSA-based progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), overall survival (OS) and toxicity (according to CTCAE) were analyzed. We observed a biochemical- and molecular imaging-based partial remission in 53.3% (8/15) and 66.7% (10/15) of patients, respectively. The median PSA-PFS and OS was 9.1 and 14.8 months, respectively. No serious acute adverse events were recorded. Two out of fifteen patients experienced grade 3 anemia. No other grade 3/4 toxicities were observed. RLT-related xerostomia (grade 1/2) was recorded in 2/15 patients. Our data showed a high clinical efficacy with a favorable side effects profile of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 augmented [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in this highly challenging patient cohort.

The present study aims to investigate the individual components in hops acting as allosteric modulators in GABA(A) receptors and bring further insight into the mode of action behind the sedative properties of hops. GABA-potentiating effects were measured using [H-3]ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB) radioligand binding assay in native GABA(A) receptors. Flumazenil sensitivity of GABA-potentiating effects, [H-3]Ro 15-4513, and [H-3]flunitrazepam binding assays were used to examine the binding to the classical benzodiazepines site. Humulone (alpha acid) and 6-prenylnaringenin (prenylflavonoid) were the most potent compounds displaying a modulatory activity at low micromolar concentrations. Humulone and 6-prenylnaringenin potentiated GABA-induced displacement of [H-3]EBOB binding in a concentration-dependent manner where the IC50, values for this potentiation in native GABA(A) receptors were 3.2 mu M and 3.7 mu M, respectively. Flumazenil had no significant effects on humulone- or 6-prenylnaringenin-induced displacement of [H-3]EBOB binding. [H-3]Ro 15-4513 and [H-3]flunitrazepam displacements were only minor with humulone but surprisingly prominent with 6-prenylnaringenin despite its flumazenil-insensitive modulatory activity. Thus, we applied molecular docking methods to investigate putative binding sites and poses of 6-prenylnaringenin at the GABA(A) receptor alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 isoform. Radioligand binding and docking results suggest a dual mode of action by 6-prenylnaringenin on GABA(A) receptors where it may act as a positive allosteric modulator at alpha+beta- binding interface as well as a null modulator at the flumazenil-sensitive alpha+gamma 2- binding interface.

TSPO expression is well documented in activated microglia and serves as a biomarker for imaging neuroinflammation. In addition, TSPO has also been reported to be overexpressed in a number of cancer cell lines and human tumours including glioma. Here we investigated the use of [F-18]DPA-714, a new TSPO positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand to image glioma in vivo. Methods We studied the uptake of [F-18]DPA-714 in three different rat strains implanted with 9L rat glioma cells: Fischer (F), Wistar (W) and Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Dynamic [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging, kinetic modelling of PET data and in vivo displacement studies using unlabelled DPA-714 and PK11195 were performed. Validation of TSPO expression in 9L glioma cell lines and intracranial 9L gliomas were investigated using Western blotting and immunohistochemistry of brain tissue sections. Results All rats showed significant [F-18]DPA-714 PET accumulation at the site of 9L tumour implantation compared to the contralateral brain hemisphere with a difference in uptake among the three strains (F > W > SD). The radiotracer showed high specificity for TSPO as demonstrated by the significant reduction of [F-18]DPA-714 binding in the tumour after administration of unlabelled DPA-714 or PK11195. TSPO expression was confirmed by Western blotting in 9L cells in vitro and by immunohistochemistry ex vivo. Conclusion The TSPO radioligand [F-18]DPA-714 can be used for PET imaging of intracranial 9L glioma in different rat strains. This preclinical study demonstrates the feasibility of employing [F-18]DPA-714 as an alternative radiotracer to image human glioma.

However, the cost and time needed for a separate PET/CT examination might hinder its routine implementation. In this communication, we present our initial experiences with additional low-dose 2-[F-18]FDG PET/CT as part of a dual-tracer and same-day imaging protocol which exploits the higher sensitivity exhibited by long-axial field-of-view (LAFOV) and total-body PET/CT systems and demonstrates its feasibility. Methods Fourteen patients referred for evaluation for PSMA-RLT received [(68) Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at 1 h p.i. with a standard activity of 150 MBq and an additional low-dose 2-[F-18]FDG PET/CT with 40 MBq 1 h thereafter using a long-axial field-of-view PET/CT system in a single sitting and as per institutional protocol. Scans were scrutinized by two experienced nuclear medicine physicians for mismatch findings. Results The combined protocol identified additional lesions with low or absent PSMA-expression but high FDG-avidity in 1/14 (7%) patients. The protocol was easily implemented and well tolerated by all patients. Conclusion Additional low-dose 2-[F-18]FDG-PET/CT is feasible as part of a same-day imaging protocol and can help reveal lesions of low PSMA avidity as part of therapy assessment for [Lu-177]-PSMA radioligand therapy and demonstrates higher sensitivity compared to [(68) Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT alone in some patients.

The aim of the current study was to perform the C-11-carbonylation reaction on the interior surface of a stainless-steel loop used for high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In the experimental setup, cyclotron produced C-11-labelled carbon dioxide ([C-11]CO2) was converted to [C-11]CO by reduction over heated Molybdenum and swept into an HPLC loop pre-charged with the appropriate reaction mixture. Following a 5 min reaction, the radiochemical purity (RCP) and the trapping efficiency (TE) of the reaction mixture was determined. After optimization, [C-11]N-Benzylbenzamide was obtained in quantitative radiochemical yield (RCY) following a 5 min reaction at room temperature. The methodology was further applied to label [C-11]benzoic acid (RCP >= 99%, TE>91%), [C-11]methyl benzoate (RCP >= 99%, TE>93%) and [C-11]phthalide (RCP >= 99%, TE>88%). A set of pharmaceuticals was finally radiolabelled using non-optimized conditions. Excellent yields were obtained for the histamine-3 receptor radioligand [C-11]AZ13198083, the oncology drug [C-11]olaparib and the dopamine D2 receptor radioligand [C-11]raclopride, whereas a moderate yield was observed for the high-affinity dopamine D2 receptor radioligand [C-11]FLB457. The presented "in-loop" process proved efficient for diverse C-11-carbonylations, providing [C-11]amides, [C-11]esters and [C-11]carboxylic acids in moderate to excellent RCYs. Based on the advantages associated with performing the radiolabelling step as an integrated part of the purification system, this methodology may become a valuable addition to the toolbox of methodologies used for C-11-carbonylation of drugs and radioligands for PET.

Herein, we report development of a potent iodinated radiotracer for P2X7 receptor, [I-123]TZ6019. The radiosynthesis of [I-123]TZ6019 was accomplished by allylic-tin precursor iodination using [I-123]NaI with good radiochemical yield of 85% and high radiochemical purity of > 99%. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cell line stably transfected with the human P2X7 receptor was used to characterize the binding affinity of TZ6019 by fluorescence, radioactive competitive, and saturation binding assays. A radioligand competitive binding assay with [123I] TZ6019 demonstrated that the nonradioactive compound TZ6019 has an IC50 value of 9.49 +/- 1.4 nM, and the known P2X7 receptor compound GSK1482160 has an IC50 value of 4.30 +/- 0.86 nM, consistent with previous reports. The radioligand saturation binding assay and competitive assay revealed that [I-123] TZ6019 specifically bound to the human P2X7 receptor with high affinity (K-i = 6.3 +/- 0.9 nM). In vitro autoradiography quantification with brain slices collected from 9-month old P301S tau transgenic mice along with wild type controls, revealed higher binding of [I-123] TZ6019 (35% increase) in the brain of P301S transgenic mice (n = 3, p = 0.04) compared to wild type controls. The immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that expression of P2X7 receptor was colocalized with astrocytes in the tauopathy P301S transgenic mice. [I-123] TZ6019 has specific binding for P2X7 receptor and has great potential to be a radiotracer for screening new compounds and quantifying expression of P2X7 receptor in neuroinflammation related diseases.

As the majority of PET investigations have addressed drug interaction at a single binding site, findings of multitarget engagement have been less frequently reported and have often been inconsistent with results obtained in vitro. AZD3676 [N, N-dimethyl-7-(4-(2-(pyridin-2-yl) ethyl) piperazin-1-yl) benzofuran-2-carboxamide] is a novel combined serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor antagonist that was developed for the treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we evaluated the properties of AZD3676 as a CNS drug by combining in vitro and ex vivo radioligand binding techniques, behavioral pharmacology in rodents, and PET imaging in nonhuman primates. Target engagement in the nonhuman primate brain was assessed in PET studies by determination of drug-induced occupancy using receptorselective radioligands. AZD3676 showed preclinical properties consistent with CNS drug potential, including nanomolar receptor affinity and efficacy in rodent models of learning and memory. In PET studies of the monkey brain, AZD3676 inhibited radioligand binding in a dose-dependent manner with similar affinity at both receptors. The equally high affinity at 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors as determined in vivo was not predicted from corresponding estimates obtained in vitro, suggesting more than 10-fold selectivity for 5-HT1A versus 5-HT1B receptors. These findings support the further integrated use of PET for confirmation of multitarget occupancy of CNS drugs. Importantly, earlier introduction of PET studies in nonhuman primates may reduce future development costs and the requirement for animal experiments in preclinical CNS drug development programs.

Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy Is an Effective Treatment for the Long-Term Stabilization of Malignant Gastrinomas	CANCER			English	Article						gastrinoma; somatostatin; gastrin; DOTATOC; radioligand; tumor response	TARGETED RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; ZOLLINGER-ELLISON-SYNDROME; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; SURVIVAL BENEFIT; THYROID-CANCER; Y-90-DOTATOC; TOXICITY; EXCISION; CRITERIA	BACKGROUND: Gastrinomas, a rare group of neuroendocrine tumors, are responsible for severe peptic disease and diarrhea. Although symptomatic control may be achieved with proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) and somatostatin analogues (SSAs), data are limited regarding the possible antitumor effect of the peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) with radiolabeled SSAs in gastrinoma patients. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of PRRT on symptoms, gastrin secretion, and tumor load in patients with progressive malignant gastrinomas. METHODS: We retrospectively studied 11 patients with metastatic gastrinomas followed for a mean period of 6 years. All patients were symptomatically treated with PPIs, and 9 of 11 patients received monthly injections of SSAs; all patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 0-1, and received PRRT ((90)Yttrium- or (177)Lutetium-DOTATOC) for progressive disease. Serum gastrin measurements and radiological assessment (using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria) were performed before and every 3-6 months following PRRT. RESULTS: PRRT induced symptomatic improvement in all patients. The mean serum gastrin decreased significantly from 4831 mI/L to 932.6 mI/L (normal, 40-108 mI/L; P < .001). Periodic radiological surveillance showed complete response in 1 (9%) patient, partial tumor response in 5/11 (45%) patients, and tumor stabilization in 5/11 (45%) patients. In 7/11 (64%) patients, the antitumor effect of PRRT persisted after a median period of 14 months. Four of 11 (36%) patients died due to tumor progression (median time to progression, 11 months); in this group, the mean survival time after the last PRRT was 14 +/- 6.9 months. CONCLUSIONS: PRRT seems to be a promising tool for the management of patients with inoperable or progressive metastatic gastrinomas. Cancer 2011; 117: 1377-85. (C) 2010 American Cancer Society.

In the concentration range 0.5 to 2 mM, (+/-)-isoflurane inhibited Ca-45(2+) fluxes and functionally modulated the effects of the Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine (1-10 muM). Isoflurane-induced inhibition of Ca-45(2+) fluxes was not significantly affected by pretreatment with either pertussis toxin (5 mug/ml or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (50 nM). Further experiments indicated that there were no significant differences between (+)- and (-)-stereoisomers of isoflurane with respect to the extent of inhibition of Ca-45(2+) fluxes. Radioligand binding studies indicated that racemic and (+)- and (-)-isoflurane were equally effective in displacing the specific binding of ['HIPN 200-110 to transverse tubule membranes. There were no apparent differences between the effects of (+)- and (-)-isoflurane on the characteristics of [H-3]PN 200-110 binding. Although the concentrations of isoflurane for the inhibitions of Ca-45(2+) fluxes and radioligand bindings were similar, the concentrations of n-alcohols required for the inhibition of Ca-45(2+) fluxes were lower than those for the displacement of radioligand. Comparison of the data for the displacement of [H-3]PN 200-110 binding and the inhibition of Ca-45(2+) fluxes by isoflurane and by n-alcohols suggested that both isoflurane and n-alcohols may have more than a single binding site. In conclusion, results indicate that isoflurane, independent of intracellular Ca2+ levels, nonstereospecifically inhibits the function of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and this effect is mediated through multiple binding sites.

An expert validation process was undertaken. The survey was circulated among medical specialties involved in cancer treatment, universities, and nursing organizations. Questionnaires (156) were distributed, and 95 responses received.ResultsSevety-eight percent of medical societies indicated that training in RLT was very important and 12% important. Eighty-eight percent indicated that their specialty training program included RLT. Twenty-six percent were satisfied with the existing structure of training in RLTs. Ninety-four percent indicated that the existing training is based on theory and hands-on experience. Main identified limitations were lack of centers ready to train and of personnel available for teaching. Sixty-five percent indicated that national programs could be expanded. Fifty percent of consulted universities indicated partial or scarce presence of RLT contents in their teaching programs. In 26% of the cases, the students do not have the chance to visit a RLT facility. A large majority of the universities are interested in further expansion of RLT contents in their curriculums. Nursing organizations almost never (44.4%) or occasionally (33.3%) include RLT contents in the education of nurses and technologists. Hands-on experience is almost never (38%) and sometimes (38%) offered. However, 67% of centers indicated high interest in expanding RLT contents.ConclusionCenters involved recognize the importance of the training and indicate a need for inclusion of additional clinical content, imaging analysis, and interpretation as well as extended hands-on training. A concerted effort to adapt current programs and a shift towards multidisciplinary training programs is necessary for proper education in RLT in Europe.

For more than a decade, Mas has been viewed as the receptor for Ang 1-7; however, Ang 1-7 binding has not been pharmacologically characterized in tissue membrane preparations. Methods Radioligand-binding assays were carried out using tissue membrane preparations using radioiodinated Angiotensin 1-7 (I-125-Ang 1-7) to characterize its binding site. Non-radioactive I-127-Ang 1-7 was used to test if the addition of an iodine to the tyrosine(4) moiety of Ang 1-7 changes the ability of Ang 1-7 to competitively inhibit I-125-Ang 1-7 binding. Results I-125-Ang 1-7 binds saturably, with moderately high affinity (10-20 nM) to a binding site in rat liver membranes that is displaceable by I-127-Ang 1-7 at nanomolar concentrations (IC50 = 62 nM) while Ang 1-7 displaces at micromolar concentrations (IC50 = 80 mu M) at similar to 22 degrees C. This binding was also displaceable by inhibitors of metalloproteases at room temperature. This suggests that I-125-Ang 1-7 binds to MMPs and/or ADAMs as well as other liver membrane elements at similar to 22 degrees C. However, when I-125-Ang 1-7-binding assays were run at 0-4 degrees C, the same MMP inhibitors did not effectively compete for I-125-Ang 1-7. Conclusions The addition of an iodine molecule to the tyrosine in position 4 of Ang 1-7 drastically changes the binding characteristics of this peptide making it unsuitable for characterization of Ang 1-7 receptors.

In a previous series of experiments, we have made an attempt to selectively label D3 receptors in the monkey brain using [C-11]RGH-1756. Despite high selectivity and affinity of RGH-1756 in vitro, [C-11]RGH-1756 displayed only low specific binding to D3 receptors in vivo. The aim of the present study was to examine whether low specific binding of [C-11]RGH-1756 is caused by insufficient in vivo affinity of the ligand, or by high physiological occupancy of D3 receptors by endogenous dopamine (DA). PET experiments were performed in three monkeys under baseline conditions and after administration of reserpine (0.5 mg/kg). The results of the baseline measurements corresponded well to our earlier observations with [C-11]RGH-1756. Reserpine caused no evident change in the regional distribution of [C-11]RGH- 1756 in the monkey brain, and no conspicuous regional accumulation of activity could be observed. After reserpine treatment there was no evident increase of specific binding and binding potential (BP) of [C-11]RGH- 1756. The lack of increased [C-11]RGH- 1756 binding after reserpine treatment indicates that competition with endogenous DA is not the predominant reason for the failure of the radioligand to label D3 receptors. Therefore, the low binding of [C-11]RGH- 1756 could largely be explained by the need for very high affinity of radioligand for D3 receptors in vivo, to obtain a suitable signal for the minute densities of D3 receptors expressed in the primate brain.

Investigation of these receptors invivo depends on the availability of imaging agents such as radioactively labelled ligands applicable in positron emission tomography (PET). We report on a series of new ligands for (7) nAChRs designed by the combination of dibenzothiophene dioxide as a novel hydrogen bond acceptor functionality with diazabicyclononane as an established cationic center. To assess the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of this new basic structure, we further modified the cationic center systematically by introduction of three different piperazine-based scaffolds. Based on invitro binding affinity and selectivity, assessed by radioligand displacement studies at different rat and human nAChR subtypes and at the structurally related human 5-HT3 receptor, we selected the compound 7-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-2-fluorodibenzo-[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide (10a) for radiolabeling and further evaluation invivo. Radiosynthesis of [F-18]10a was optimized and transferred to an automated module. Dynamic PET imaging studies with [F-18]10a in piglets and a monkey demonstrated high uptake of radioactivity in the brain, followed by washout and target-region specific accumulation under baseline conditions. Kinetic analysis of [F-18]10a in pig was performed using a two-tissue compartment model with arterial-derived input function. Our initial evaluation revealed that the dibenzothiophene-based PET radioligand [F-18]10a ([F-18]DBT-10) has high potential to provide clinically relevant information about the expression and availability of (7) nAChR in the brain.

CGRP(2) receptors have been previously reported to mediate relaxation of large porcine coronary arteries because this action is antagonized with low affinity by h alpha -CGRP(8-37). In the present study, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, radioligand binding, and values from our previously reported isolated tissue experiments to compare the CGRP receptor in porcine coronary arteries with the porcine CGRP(1) receptor stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. We identified calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity modifying protein 1 mRNA in coronary arteries. We also found that the ligand binding characteristics of the CGRP receptor in coronary arteries and the cloned CGRP(1) receptor were highly similar. K-i values for h alpha CGRP(8-37) were 6.6 and 5.7 nM in porcine coronary arteries and the cloned CGRP, receptor, respectively. The affinities (K-B) of h alpha -CGRP(8-37) and five other antagonists were 22- to 707-fold lower in functional experiments measuring relaxation of coronary arteries than in radioligand binding experiments. Despite this difference in absolute affinity values, there was a high correlation of the rank order of affinity for the antagonists determined by the two methods. Thus h alpha -CGRP(8-37) antagonizes CGRP-induced relaxation of porcine coronary arteries with low affinity at the CGRP(1) receptor. Taken together, these data do not support the existence of the CGRP(2) receptor.

To overcome gastric cancer resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, we have conjugated trastu-zumab with a beta-emitting therapeutic isotope, lutetium-177, to deliver radiation locally to gastric tumors with minimal toxicity. Because trastuzumab-based tar -geted radioligand therapy (RLT) requires only the extramembrane domain binding of membrane-bound HER2 receptors, HER2-targeting RLT can bypass any resist-ance mechanisms that occur downstream of HER2 binding. Leveraging our previ-ous discoveries that statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, can enhance the cell surface-bound HER2 to achieve effective drug delivery in tumors, we proposed that the combination of statins and [177Lu]Lu-trastuzumab-based RLT can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of HER2-targeted RLT in drug-resistant gastric cancers. We demonstrate that lovastatin elevates cell surface HER2 levels and increases the tumor-absorbed radiation dose of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-trastuzumab. Furthermore, lovastatin-modulated [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-trastuzumab RLT durably inhibits tumor growth and prolongs overall survival in mice bearing NCI-N87 gastric tumors and HER2-positive patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) of known clinical resistance to tras-tuzumab therapy. Statins also exhibit a radioprotective effect, reducing radiotoxicity in a mice cohort given the combination of statins and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-trastuzumab. Since statins are commonly prescribed to patients, our results strongly support the feasibility of clinical studies that combine lovastatin with HER2-targeted RLT in HER2-postive patients and trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive patients.

C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4-Targeted Radioligand Therapy in Patients with Advanced T-Cell Lymphoma	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4; CXCR4; chemokine receptor; theranostics; radioligand therapy; T-cell lymphoma	NON-HODGKIN-LYMPHOMA; CXCR4-DIRECTED ENDORADIOTHERAPY; ACUTE-LEUKEMIA; CHOP; STEM	C-X-Cmotif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) has already been applied to advanced blood cancers, such as multiple myeloma or diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We present a series of patients with advanced T-cell lymphoma (TCL) who were scheduled for CXCR4-directed therapy as a conditioning regimen, followed by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Methods: Four patients with advanced, heavily pretreated, and relapsed TCL (2 men, 2 women; median age, 50 y) without suitable alternative therapeutic options underwent CXCR4-directed PET and pretherapeutic dosimetry. We then conducted CXCR4-targeted RLT in combination with allogeneic (3/4, 75%) or autologous (1/4, 25%) HSCT. One patient also underwent radioimmunotherapy targeting CD66 to enhance therapeutic efficacy. We investigated safety, best response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: Pretherapeutic dosimetry indicated lymphoma-absorbed doses of up to 33.2 Gy from CXCR4-targeted RLT. Except for 1 patient who developed tumor lysis syndrome along with transient grade 3 kidney failure, no acute toxicity, allergic reactions, or other adverse events were recorded during therapy. One patient developed septicemia and subsequently died 16 d after RLT, whereas engraftment was achieved in the remaining 3 patients (75%). During follow-up, a partial response was recorded in 1 of 3 patients (33.3%) and a completemetabolic response in the other two (66.7%, with 1 patient also receiving additional radioimmunotherapy). Median progression-free survival was 7mo (range, 4-25mo). After a median follow-up of 54 mo (range, 4-56 mo), 3 patients were still alive at the date of censoring. Conclusion: For advanced, heavily pretreated TCL, CXCR4-directed RLTmay serve as an effective conditioning therapy before HSCT and can cause substantial antilymphoma activity, leading to a remarkable response in selected cases.

In the autoradiography experiments, high [F-18]FE-PE2I accumulation was observed in caudate and putamen that was selectively abolished by GBR12909 or beta-CIT but not by maprotiline. High doses of citalopram (>5 mu M) also inhibited [F-18]FE-PE2I binding in the striatum. In vitro K-i of the radioligand was 12 nM at rodent dopamine transporter. [F-18]FE-PE2I brain uptake measured by PET was similar to 4-5% of the injected dose, with highest uptake in striatum followed by midbrain and thalamus, lower uptake in neocortex, and lowest in cerebellum. Peak specific binding in striatum was reached similar to 40 min and in midbrain 20-30 min postinjection. The ratio-to-cerebellum was 7-10 in striatum and 1.5-2.3 in midbrain. BPND measured with simplified reference tissue method using the cerebellum as reference region was 4.5 in striatum and 0.6 in midbrain. No displacement was shown after citalopram or maprotiline administration, while GBR12909 decreased the binding in striatum and midbrain to the level of cerebellum. [F-18]FE-PE2I showed relatively fast elimination and metabolism with the presence of two metabolite peaks with similar retention time as the labeled metabolites of [C-11]PE2I. [F-18]FE-PE2I showed in vivo selectivity for the DAT and compared with [C-11]PE2I, it showed faster kinetics and earlier peak equilibrium. The potential influence of the two radiometabolites on PET quantification requires further evaluation. Synapse 63:871-880, 2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Activation of P2X7 receptors leads to rapid changes in intracellular calcium concentrations, release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 beta, and following prolonged agonist exposure, the formation of cytolytic pores in plasma membranes. Data from gene knockout studies and recently described selective antagonists indicate a role for P2X7 receptor activation in inflammation and pain. While several species selective P2X7 antagonists exist, A-804598 represents a structurally novel, competitive, and selective antagonist that has equivalent high affinity at rat (IC50 = 10 nM), mouse (IC50 = 9 nM) and human (IC50 = 11 nM) P2X7 receptors. A-804598 also potently blocked agonist stimulated release of IL-I beta and Yo-Pro uptake from differentiated THP-1 cells that natively express human P2X7 receptors. A-804598 was tritiated ([H-3]IA-804598; 8.1 Ci/mmol) and utilized to study recombinant rat P2X7 receptors expressed in 1321N1 cells. [H-3]A-804598 labeled a single class of high affinity binding sites (K-d = 2.4 nM and apparent B-max = 0.56 pmol/mg). No specific binding was observed in untransfected 1321N1 cells. The pharmacological profile for P2X antagonists to inhibit [H-3]A-804598 binding correlated with their ability to block functional activation of P2X7 receptors (r = 0.95, P < 0.05). These data demonstrate that A-804598 is one of the most potent and selective antagonists for mammalian P2X7 receptors described to date and [H-3]A-804598 is a high affinity antagonist radioligand that specifically labels rat P2X7 receptors.

Starting from the dodecapeptide MCH6 (17), we found that: (1) substitution of Tyr(13) by a Phe residue; (3) addition of a 3-iodo-Tyr residue at the N-terminus; and (3) addition of a hydrophilic spacer 8-amino-3.6-dioxyoctanoyl between the 3-iodo-Tyr and MCH, 17 (compound S36057), led to an agonist more potent than MCH itself in stimulating [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding at membranes from HEK293 cells stably expressing the human MCH receptor. 2 Specific binding of [I-125]-S36057 was found in HEK293 and CHO cell lines stably expressing the human MCH receptor. This radioligand recognized a similar number of binding sites (c cr. 800 fmol mg(-1)) than [I-125]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH. 3 However, the KI, for [(12)5T]-S36057 obtained from saturation studies (0.037 nhl) or from binding kinetics (0.046 nhl) was at least 10 fold higher to that of [I-125]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH (0.46 nhl). 4 Affinities determined for a series of MCH analogues were similar with both radioligands, S36057 being the most potent compound tested (K-1 = 0.053 nM). 5 Finally, [I-125]-S36057 also potently labelled the MCH receptor in membranes from whole rat brain (K-D 0.044 nh l. B-max= 11 fmolmg(-1)). 6 Tn conclusion, [I-125]-S36057 is a more potent and more stable radioligand than [I-125]-[3-iodo Tyr(13)]-MCH that will represent a reliable tool for binding assays in the search of novel MCH ligands. It should also provide great help for autoradiographic studies of the MCH receptor distribution in the central nervous system.

In earlier studies, like a variety of anesthetics, cOA modulated gamma -aminobutyric acid(A) receptors and inhibited transmitter release/burst firing in cultured neurones or synaptoneurosomes. Methods: Here, radioligand binding ([H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha -benzoate and mouse central nervous system synaptoneurosomes) and voltage clamp (whole cell recording from cultured NIE115 murine neuroblastoma) confirmed an interaction with neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC). Results: cOA stereoselectively inhibited specific binding of toxin to VGSC (inhibitor concentration that displaces 50% of specifically bound radioligand, 39.5 muM). cOA increased (4x) the K-d of toxin binding without affecting its binding maximum. Rate of dissociation of radioligand was increased without altering association kinetics, suggesting an allosteric effect (indirect competition at site 2 on VGSC). cOA blocked tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium currents (maximal effect and affinity were significantly greater at depolarized potentials; P < 0.01). Between 3.2 and 64 <mu>M, the block was concentration-dependent and saturable, but cOA did not alter the V-50 for activation curves or the measured reversal potential (P > 0.05). Inactivation curves were significantly shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction by cOA (maximum, -15.4 +/- 0.9 mV at 32 muM). cOA (10 muM) slowed recovery from inactivation, with tau increasing from 3.7 +/- 0.4 ms to 6.4 +/- 0.5 ms (P < 0.001). cOA did not produce frequency-dependent facilitation of block (up to 10 Hz). Conclusions: These effects (and the capacity of oleamide to modulate <gamma>-aminobutyric acid(A) receptors in earlier studies) are strikingly similar to those of a variety of anesthetics. Oleamide may represent an endogenous ligand for depressant drug sites in mammalian brain.

Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer can be successfully treated by delivery of beta particle-emitting (177)Lutetium to the prostate-specific antigen in a therapeutic concept termed radioligand therapy. Imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) plays a crucial role in patient selection prior to radioligand therapy and subsequent molecular response assessment. The presented study aims to investigate the role of quantitative uptake parameters on baseline (68)Gallium-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging as to their association with lesion response to radioligand therapy at individual tumor sites. Special emphasis is placed on the utility of PSMA-uptake thresholds for pretherapeutic prediction of lesion response. Baseline uptake on prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted imaging is a prerequisite for radioligand therapy (RLT) with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. This study aims to quantify lesion-based response to RLT in relation to pretreatment standard molecular imaging metrics derived from [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Sixty-one patients with mCRPC underwent [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging before and after a median of 4 (IQR 2-6) RLT cycles. Maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax, SUVmean), as well as tumor-to-liver ratio (TLR), were assessed. A median of 12 (IQR 7-17) lesions was analyzed per patient, resulting in a total of 718 lesions. Lesions with >= 30% SUVmax decline or falling below the blood pool uptake were considered responsive; >= 30% SUVmax increase marked lesion progression. Additionally, 4-point visual scoring was performed according to E-PSMA consensus. In total, 550/718 (76.6%) lesions responded to RLT, including 389/507 (76.7%) bone metastases and 143/181 (79.0%) lymph node metastases. Baseline SUVmax, SUVmean, and TLR values were associated with lesion response by a moderate but significant correlation (r(s) = 0.33, p < 0.001, r(s) = 0.32, p < 0.001, and r(s) = 0.31, p < 0.001, respectively). For the classification of lesion progression based on baseline PSMA uptake, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) found SUVmax, SUVmean, and TLR to have comparable discriminatory value (AUC 0.85, 0.87, and 0.83). Of 42 tumor sites with baseline uptake below the liver (V-score < 2), 19/42 (45.2%) were responsive, 9/42 (21.4%) were stable, and 14/42 (33.3%) showed progression, leaving liver uptake a threshold with low prognostic value for the identification of RLT-refractory lesions (PPV 33%). This was observed accordingly for various liver uptake-based thresholds, including TLR < 1.5, <2.0 with a PPV at 24%, 20%, respectively. Standard uptake parameters quantified by routine baseline [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT are moderately associated with post-treatment lesion response to [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Commonly applied liver-based uptake thresholds have limited value in predicting refractory lesions at individual tumor sites.

Based on similarities of the regional binding patterns for [C-11]AZD9272 and the monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) radioligand [C-17]L-deprenyl-D2 in PET studies of the human brain we tested the hypothesis that the unique binding of fenobam and AZD9272 may represent specific binding to the MAO-B. PET data previously acquired for subjects examined using [C-11]AZD9272 or [C-11]L-deprenyl-D2 were re-evaluated to assess the correlations between radioligand binding parameters in human brain. In addition, the pharmacology of AZD9272 binding sites was characterized using competition binding studies carried out in vivo in non-human primates (NHPs) and in vitro using autoradiography in selected human brain regions. The regional binding of [C-11]AZD9272 in human brain was closely correlated with that of [C-11]L-deprenyl-D2. In PET studies of NHP brain administration of the MAO-B ligand L-deprenyl inhibited binding of radiolabeled AZD9272 and administration of fenobam inhibited binding of [C-11]L-deprenyl-D2. Binding of radiolabeled AZD9272 in vitro was potently inhibited by fenobam or MAO-B compounds, and [C-11]L-deprenyl-D2 binding was inhibited by fenobam or AZD9272. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that both fenobam and AZD9272 bind to the MAO-B, which may be of relevance for understanding the mechanism of the psychosis-like adverse events reported for these compounds. Such understanding may serve as a lead to generate new models for the pathophysiology of psychosis.

Distribution of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) receptor binding in the mouse brain using a new, high-affinity radioligand, [<SUP>125</SUP>I]-PD-Sauvagine	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						corticotropin-releasing factor; G protein-coupled receptor; radioligand binding; sauvagine; stress; urocortin; RRID: AB_218182	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; FACTOR-LIKE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; NAKED MOLE-RATS; NUCLEUS AMBIGUUS; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; UROCORTIN 3	The corticotropin-releasing factor ()CRF) family of peptides includes CRF and three urocortins, which signal through two distinct G-protein coupled receptors, CRF1 and CRF2. Although the cellular distribution of CRF receptor expression has been well characterized at the mRNA level, the localization of receptor protein, and, by inference, of functional receptors, has been limited by a lack of reliable immunohistochemical evidence. Recently, a CRF-related peptide, termed PDsauvagine, was isolated from the skin of the frog, Pachymedusa dacnicolor, and validated as a highaffinity ligand for CRF receptor studies. A radiolabeled analog, [I-125]-PD-sauvagine, with high signal-to-noise ratio, was used in autoradiographic studies to map the distribution of CRF receptor binding sites in the mouse brain. Through the use of receptor-deficient mice and subtype-specific antagonists, CRF1 and CRF2 binding sites were isolated, and found to be readily reconcilable with regional patterns of mRNA expression. Binding site distributions within a given structure sometimes differed from mRNA patterns, however, particularly in laminated structures of the isocortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum, presumably reflecting the trafficking of receptors to their operational homes on neuronal ()mostly dendritic) processes. Binding patterns of [I-125]-PD-sauvagine provided independent assessments of controversial receptor localizations, failing to provide support for CRF1 expression in central autonomic components of the limbic forebrain, the locus coeruleus and cerebellar Purkinje cells, or for CRF2 in any aspect of the cerebellar cortex. Though lacking in ideal resolution, in vitro binding of the PD-sauvagine radioligand currently provides the most sensitive and accurate available tool for localizing CRF receptors in rodent brain.

Characterization of [<SUP>125</SUP>I]ZM 241385 binding to adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the pineal of sheep brain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article							CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RAT-BRAIN; HYPOXIC INHIBITION; FETAL SHEEP; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; MELATONIN PRODUCTION; H-3 CGS-21680; LOCALIZATION; GLAND; PHARMACOLOGY	Adenosine is a ubiquitous neuromodulator and homeostatic regulator that exerts its physiologic actions through activation of A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) adenosine receptor subtypes. In the central nervous system, adenosine's action in neurons is manifested in its modulation of tonic inhibitory control. Adenosine released in the brain during hypoxia has critical depressant effects on breathing in fetal and newborn mammals, an action suggested to be mediated by A2A receptors in the posteromedial thalamus. In an effort to more accurately define the spatial distribution of adenosine A2A receptors in fetal sheep diencephalon, we have used a receptor autoradiographic technique utilizing an iodinated radioligand [I-125]ZM 241385, which has greater sensitivity and resolution than the tritiated compound. The distribution of ligand binding sites in the fetal sheep diencephalon indicated that the highest levels of binding were in select thalamic nuclei, including those implicated in hypoxic depression of fetal breathing, and the pineal. Given the high density of labeled A2A receptors in the pineal, these sites were characterized more fully in homogenate radioligand binding assays. These data indicate that [I-125]ZM 241385 binding sites display a pharmacological signature consistent with that of adenosine A2A receptors and are expressed at similar levels in fetal, lamb and adult ovine brain. The adenosine A2A receptor pharmacologic signature of the [I-125] ZM 241385 binding site in pineal cell membranes generalized to the site characterized in membranes derived from other portions of the lamb thalamus, including the sector involved in hypoxic inhibition of fetal breathing. These results have important implications for the functional roles of adenosine A(2A) receptors in the thalamus and pineal of sheep brain. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, one of the major difficulties in the study of these various receptor subtypes is the current lack of highly selective probes to investigate a single receptor class. Up to most recently, this was particularly true for the Y-4 and Y-5 subtypes. 2 [hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY, the first highly selective Y-5 agonist, was iodinated using the chloramine T method and purified by high-pressure liquid chromatography. 3 Binding performed in rat brain homogenates revealed that equilibrium was reached after 120 min (t(1/2) = 21 min) and 60 min (t(1/2) = 12 min) at 25 and 100 pM [I-125][hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY, respectively. 4 Isotherm saturation binding experiments demonstrated that [I-125][hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY binds to an apparent single population with high- affinity (K-D of 1.2 and 1.7 nM) and low-capacity (B-max of 14 +/- 3 fmol/100,000 cells and 20 +/- 5 fmol/mg protein) sites in Y-5 receptor HEK293-transfected cells and rat brain membrane homogenates, respectively. No specific [I-125][hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY binding sites could be detected in Y-1, Y-2 or Y-4 receptors transfected HEK293 cells, demonstrating the high selectivity of this ligand for the Y-5 subtype. 5 Competition binding experiments performed in rat brain membrane homogenates and Y-5-receptor transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that specific [I-125][hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY binding was competed with high affinity by Y-5 agonists and antagonists such as [Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY, [hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY, hPP, CGP71683A and JCF109, but not by Y-1 (BIBP3226), Y-2 (BIIE0246) and Y-1/Y-4 (GR231118) preferential ligands. 6 Taken together, these data demonstrate that [I-125][hPP(1-17), Ala(31), Aib(32)]NPY is the first highly selective Y-5 radioligand to be developed. This new probe should prove most useful for further detailed studies of the molecular and pharmacological properties of this receptor subtype in brain and peripheral tissues.

Here, we took advantage of transgenic mouse models of tauopathies to evaluate associations between PET and postmortem measures of tau probe binding and their relation to neuronal loss. Methods: PET with a tau probe, C-11-PBB3 (2-((1E, 3E)-4-(6-(C-11-methylamino) pyridine-3-yl) buta-1,3-dienyl) benzo[d] thiazol-6-ol), and volumetric MRI were performed for transgenic rTg4510 mice and nontransgenic mice. Binding of 11C-PBB3 and its blockade by another tau binding compound, AV-1451 (-(6-fluoropyridine- 3-yl)-5H-pyrido[4,3-b] indole), in homogenized brains of tauopathy patients and rTg4510 and PS19 mice were quantified, and C-11-PBB3-positive and phosphorylated tau lesions in sectioned brains of these mice were assessed. Results: In vivo 11C-PBB3 binding to the rTg4510 neocortex/hippocampus was increased relative to controls and correlated with local atrophy. In vitro C-11-PBB3 binding in the neocortex/hippocampus also correlated well with in vivo radioligand binding and regional atrophy in the same individual rTg4510 mice. By contrast, in vitro 11C-PBB3 binding was elevated in the brain stem but not hippocampus of PS19 mice, despite a pronounced loss of neurons in the hippocampus rather than brain stem. Finally, C-11-PBB3 and AV-1451 showed similar binding properties between mouse models and tauopathy patients. Conclusion: The present findings support the distinct utilities of C-11-PBB3 PET and MRI in rTg4510 and PS19 mice for quantitatively pursuing mechanisms connecting PET-detectable and PET-undetectable tau aggregations to neuronal death, which recapitulate 2 different modes of tau-provoked neurotoxicity.

Development of a Highly Selective Allosteric Antagonist Radioligand for the Type 1 Cholecystokinin Receptor and Elucidation of Its Molecular Basis of Binding	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							2ND EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; A RECEPTOR; PEPTIDE AGONIST; PHARMACOLOGICAL PROFILE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; STRUCTURAL BASIS; SITE; ACTIVATION; DOCKING; LIGANDS	Understanding the molecular basis of ligand binding to receptors provides insights useful for rational drug design. This work describes development of a new antagonist radioligand of the type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R), (2-fluorophenyl)2,3-dihydro-3-[(3-isoquinolinylcarbonyl)amino]-6-methoxy-2-oxo-l-H-indole-3-propanoate (T-0632), and exploration of the molecular basis of its binding. This radioligand bound specifically with high affinity within an allosteric pocket of CCK1R. T-0632 fully inhibited binding and action of CCK at this receptor, while exhibiting no saturable binding to the closely related type 2 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK2R). Chimeric CCK1R/CCK2R constructs were used to explore the molecular basis of T-0632 binding. Exchanging exonic regions revealed the functional importance of CCK1R exon 3, extending from the bottom of transmembrane segment (TM) 3 to the top of TM5, including portions of the intramembranous pocket as well as the second extracellular loop region (ECL2). However, CCK1R mutants in which each residue facing the pocket was changed to that present in CCK2R had no negative impact on T-0632 binding. Extending the chimeric approach to ECL2 established the importance of its C-terminal region, and site-directed mutagenesis of each nonconserved residue in this region revealed the importance of Ser(208) at the top of TM5. A molecular model of T-0632-occupied CCK1R was consistent with these experimental determinants, also identifying Met(121) in TM3 and Arg(336) in TM6 as important. Although these residues are conserved in CCK2R, mutating them had a distinct impact on the two closely related receptors, suggesting differential orientation. This establishes the molecular basis of binding of a highly selective nonpeptidyl allosteric antagonist of CCK1R, illustrating differences in docking that extend beyond determinants attributable to distinct residues lining the intramembranous pocket in the two receptor subtypes.

In view of further assessment of the suitability of (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER as a NET radioligand, its metabolism and the identity of the in vivo radiometabolites of (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER are of great interest. Materials and Methods: Thus, PET studies were used to measure brain dynamics of (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER, and plasma reverse-phase radiochromatographic analysis was performed to monitor and quantify its rate of metabolism. Eighteen healthy human volunteers, five cynomolgus monkeys, and five rats were studied. Results and Discussion: In human subjects, the plasma radioactivity representing (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER decreased from 88+/-5% at 4 min after injection to 82+/-7% at 40 min, while a polar radiometabolite increased from 3+/-3% to 16+/-7% at the same time-points, respectively. A more lipophilic radiometabolite than (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER decreased from 9+/-5% at 4 min to 1+/-2% at 40 min. In monkeys, plasma radioactivity representing (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER decreased from 97 +/- 2% at 4 min to 74+/-7% at 45 min, with a polar fraction as the major radiometabolite. A more lipophilic radiometabolite than (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER, constituted 3+/-2% of radioactivity at 4 min and was not detectable later on. In rats, 17+/-4% of plasma radioactivity was parent radioligand at 30 min with the remainder comprising mainly a polar radiometabolite. (S,S)-[C-11] MeNER in rat brain and urine at 30 min after injection were 90% and 4%, respectively. On a brain regional level, parent radioligand ranged from 87.5+/-3.9% (57.2+/-14.2% SUV [standard uptake values, % injected radioactivity per mL multiplied with animal weight (in g)]; cerebellum) to 92.9+/-1.8% (36.1+/-4.7% SUV; striatum), with differential distribution of the radiometabolite in the cerebellum (6.7+/-0.3% SUV) and the striatum (2.5+/-0.3% SUV). Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of rat urine identified a hydroxylation product of the methoxyphenoxy ring of (S,S)-MeNER as the main metabolite. In the brain, the corresponding main metabolite was the product from O-de-methylation of (S,S)-MeNER. PET measurements were performed in rats as well as in wild-type and P-gp-knock-out mice. In rats, the brain peak level of radioactivity was found to be very low (65%SUV). In mice, there was only a small difference in peak brain accumulation between P-gp knock-out and wild-type mice (145 vs. 125% SUV) with the following rank order of regional brain radioactivity: cerebellum x thalamus > cortical regions > striatum. Conclusion: It can be concluded that radiometabolites of (S, S)-[C-11]MeNER are of minor importance in rat and monkey brain imaging. The presence of a transient lipophilic radiometabolite in peripheral human plasma may induce complications with brain imaging, but its kinetics appear favorable in relation to the slow kinetics of (S, S)-[C-11]MeNER in humans.

Various structural modifications were performed and the inhibitory activities at human cloned D-1, D-2L, and D-5 receptors were measured by using a simple fluorescence microplate reader based calcium assay. Subsequently, the affinities of active compounds were estimated by radioligand binding experiments. Deleting one of the aromatic rings as well as replacing it by a phenyl moiety abolishes the inhibitory activities almost completely. Contraction of the 10-membered central ring decreases them significantly. The replacement of indole by thiophene or N-methylpyrrole reduces the inhibitory activity, whereas replacing the indole by benzene increases it. Finally, the hydroxylated dibenz[d,g]azecine derivative 11d (LE404) was found to be more active than the lead I in the functional calcium assay as well as in radioligand displacement experiments.

Concise and Scalable Radiosynthesis of (+)-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]MDL100907 as a Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> Receptor Antagonist for PET	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						5-HT2A; radiofluorination; coppercatalysis; Liebeskind-Srogl reaction	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MEDIATED F-18-FLUORINATION; RADIOLIGAND; LIGAND; F-18; BEHAVIOR	5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2A) receptors play an important role in several psychiatric disorders. In order to investigate the serotonin (5-HT) receptor in vivo, reliable syntheses are required for positron emission tomography (PET) 5-HT radioligands. Owing to the excellent in vivo properties of [F-18]-MDL100907 for PET, there has been great interest to develop a novel synthetic route for [F-18]-MDL100907. Here, we report a highly efficient, scalable, and expedient synthesis for [F-18]-MDL100907. The radiofluorination was performed on a F-18-labeling boron pinacol ester precursor, which is synthesized using the Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction as a key step. Our method is practically more suitable to employ late-stage Cu-mediated radiofluorination and facilitate the production of the [F-18]-MDL100907 radioligand in excellent decay-corrected RCY of 32 +/- 10% (n = 7) within 60 min. We prepared [F-18]-MDL100907 in high molar activity (2.1 Ci/mu mol) and compared it to [C-11]-MDL100907 in the brain of a nonhuman primate.

Most compounds were negative allosteric modulators of [H-3]dofetilide binding to the channel, in particular 7f, 7h-j and 7p. Compounds 7f and 7p were the most potent negative allosteric modulators amongst all ligands, significantly increasing the dissociation rate of dofetilide in the radioligand kinetic binding assay, while remarkably reducing the affinities of dofetilide and astemizole in a competitive displacement assay. Additionally, both 7f and 7p displayed peculiar displacement characteristics with Hill coefficients significantly distinct from unity as shown by e.g., dofetilide, further indicative of their allosteric effects on dofetilide binding. Our findings in this investigation yielded several promising negative allosteric modulators for future functional and clinical research with respect to their antiarrhythmic propensities, either alone or in combination with known K(v)11.1 blockers.

Radioiodinated 8, (R)-8, and (S)-8 were prepared by radioiododestannylation of the tributyltin analogues in high yields, radiochemical purities, and specific radioactivities. In a mouse hippocampal membrane preparation with [I-131](R)-8 as radioligand, racemic 8 exhibited a K-i value of 0.2 nM compared with 1.6 nM for WIN55212-2. In autoradiographic experiments with mouse brain sections, the distribution of radioiodinated 8 was consistent with that of brain CB1 receptors. Again, very little specific binding was seen with the (S)-enantiomer [I-131](S)-8 and none occurred with the (R)-enantiomer [I-131] (R)-8 in sections from CB1 receptor knockout mice. Radioiodinated 8 thus appears to be a suitable radioligand for studies of CB1 cannabinoid receptors.

Two binding sites for [<SUP>3</SUP>H]PBR28 in human brain: implications for TSPO PET imaging of neuroinflammation	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						PBR; [H-3]PBR28; [H-3]PK11195; radioligand binding; TSPO	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LEYDIG TUMOR-CELLS; PROTEIN 18 KDA; IN-VIVO; SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; H-3 RACLOPRIDE; LIGANDS; MICROGLIA	[C-11] PBR28, a radioligand targeting the translocator protein (TSPO), does not produce a specific binding signal in approximately 14% of healthy volunteers. This phenomenon has not been reported for [C-11] PK11195, another TSPO radioligand. We measured the specific binding signals with [H-3] PK11195 and [H-3] PBR28 in brain tissue from 22 donors. Overall, 23% of the samples did not generate a visually detectable specific autoradiographic signal with [H-3] PBR28, although all samples showed [H-3] PK11195 binding. There was a marked reduction in the affinity of [H-3] PBR28 for TSPO in samples with no visible [H-3] PBR28 autoradiographic signal (K-i = 188 +/- 15.6nmol/L), relative to those showing normal signal (K-i = 3.4 +/- 0.5 nmol/L, P < 0.001). Of this latter group, [H-3] PBR28 bound with a two-site fit in 40% of cases, with affinities (Ki) of 4.0 +/- 2.4 nmol/L (high-affinity site) and 313 +/- 77nmol/L (low-affinity site). There was no difference in K-d or B-max for [H-3] PK11195 in samples showing no [H-3] PBR28 autoradiographic signal relative to those showing normal [H-3] PBR28 autoradiographic signal. [H-3] PK11195 bound with a single site for all samples. The existence of three different binding patterns with PBR28 (high-affinity binding (46%), low-affinity binding (23%), and two-site binding (31%)) suggests that a reduction in [C-11] PBR28 binding may not be interpreted simply as a reduction in TSPO density. The functional significance of differences in binding characteristics warrants further investigation.

However, the functional neuroanatomy of DORs has not been mapped in any detail; this is potentially important, because these receptors appear to be primarily cytosolic. Opioid receptors can couple to G(i/o) G proteins, a process that is detected by agonist-stimulated [S-35]guanylyl-5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS) binding. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the distribution of functional DORs, as assessed by [S-35]GTPgammaS autoradiographic labeling in response to the DOR agonist deltorphin II. For comparison, adjacent sections were labeled with [I-125]deltorphin II or the DOR antagonist [I-125]AR-M100613. In all three assays, mu-opioid receptors were blocked pharmacologically. The distributions of [I-125]deltorphin II and [I-125]AR-M100613 were highly correlated but not identical. Deltorphin II increased [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in a concentration-dependent and naltrindole-sensitive manner. The regional [S-35]GTPgammaS response to deltorphin II was only moderately predicted by agonist or antagonist radioligand binding (r = 0.67 and 0.50, respectively). [S-35]GTPgammaS responses to deltorphin II were strongest in the extended striatum (caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, olfactory tubercle) and cerebral cortex. In contrast, some areas reported to mediate DOR analgesia (brainstem, spinal cord) possessed a much lower [S-35]GTPgammaS response. These findings demonstrate the existence of a partial mismatch between DOR radioligand binding and [S-35]GTPgammaS response. This divergence possibly reflects regional heterogeneity in G-protein receptor coupling, or in the subcellular localization of DOR. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Factor analysis is often applied for this purpose. This paper introduces a novel approach that conducts a new kind of nonlinear factor analysis relying on a compartment model, and computes the kinetic parameters of specific binding tissues jointly. To this end, it capitalizes on data-driven parametric imaging methods to provide a physical description of the underlying PET data, directly relating the specific binding with the kinetics of the non-specific binding in the corresponding tissues. This characterization is introduced into the factor analysis formulation to yield a novel nonlinear unmixing model designed for PET image analysis. This model also explicitly introduces global kinetic parameters that allow for a direct estimation of a binding potential that represents the ratio at equilibrium of specifically bound radioligand to the concentration of nondisplaceable radioligand in each non-specific binding tissue. The performance of the method is evaluated on synthetic and real data to demonstrate its potential interest.

However, it is unclear whether there is a neurochemical basis for extending their potential use in vascular and mixed dementias. In this study, we measured cortical H-3 receptors in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) and mixed SIVD/AD (MIX). Materials and methods: Radioligand binding assays using [H-3]GSK189254 were used to measure H-3 receptors in the postmortem frontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus and hippocampus of a cohort of longitudinally assessed SIVD, MIX and age-matched controls. Results: H-3 receptor levels were unchanged in SIVD and MIX in all areas studied. Furthermore, frontal H-3 receptor densities negatively correlated with predeath assessment of cognition using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores. Conclusion: Our data suggest that H-3 receptors are preserved in SIVD and MIX, thus supporting further assessments of H-3 antagonists as potential therapeutics in these dementias.

On the basis of their binding affinities to A beta(1-42) aggregates, the styryltriazole (1, K-i = 12.8 nM) and one resveratrol derivative (5, K-i = 0.49 nM) were labeled with F-18. In normal mice, tissue distribution of [F-18]5 showed good initial brain uptake (3.26% ID/g at 2 min) but slow wash-out from brains (2-to-60 min uptake ratio: 2.9). Furthermore, it underwent in vivo metabolic defluorination (1.88% ID/g at 2 min and 9.73% ID/g at 60 min). In contrast, [F-18]1 displayed high initial brain uptake (5.38% ID/g at 2 min) with rapid wash-out from brains (0.52% ID/g at 60 min; 2-to-60 min uptake ratio: 10.3). These results indicate that [F-18]1 has in vivo kinetics comparable to PET radiopharmaceuticals currently under commercial development, demonstrating that [F-18]1 is a desirable PET radioligand for A beta plaque imaging.

The objective of this study was to estimate the radiation absorbed doses of F-18-PBR06 based on biodistribution data in humans. Methods: After the injection of F-18-PBR06, images were acquired from head to thigh in 7 healthy humans. Urine was collected at various time points. Radiation absorbed doses were estimated by the MIRD scheme. Results: Moderate to high levels of radioactivity were observed in organs with high densities of TSPO and in organs of metabolism and excretion. Bone had low levels of radioactivity. The effective dose was 18.5 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusion: The effective dose of F-18-PBR06, compared with other F-18 radioligands, was moderate. This radioligand had negligible defluorination, as indirectly assessed by bone radioactivity. Doses to the gallbladder wall and spleen may limit the amount of permissible injected radioactivity.

In the absence of other added divalent cations Zn2+ enhanced the response to 5-HT by increasing maximum peak current (I-max) to a maximum of 122.5%, decreasing the rate of desensitization (maximum t(1/2) = 210%), and decreasing the EC50 by approximately two fold. In the presence of Ca2+ or Mg2+, the effects of Zn2+ on I-max and t(1/2) were still manifest, although higher Zn2+ concentrations were required; however, the effect on EC50 was abolished. Zn2+ also enhanced [H-3]agonist but not [H-3]antagonist binding. We propose there is more than one Zn2+ binding site on the 5-HT3 receptor molecule, and that one or more of these sites may also bind Ca2+ and Mg2+. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Evidence of neuroinflammation in fibromyalgia syndrome: a [<SUP>18</SUP>F]DPA-714 positron emission tomography study	PAIN			English	Article						DPA-714; Translocator protein; Fibromyalgia; Neuroinflammation; Positron emission tomography	TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN GENE; INDUCED SICKNESS BEHAVIOR; LOW-DOSE NALTREXONE; CENTRAL SENSITIZATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; PET; PAIN; CYTOKINES; ACTIVATION	We found increased binding of the translocator protein radioligand [18F]DPA-714 in several brain regions in fibromyalgia patients compared with healthy controls. This observational study aimed to determine whether individuals with fibromyalgia (FM) exhibit higher levels of neuroinflammation than healthy controls (HCs), as measured with positron emission tomography using [18F]DPA-714, a second-generation radioligand for the translocator protein (TSPO). Fifteen women with FM and 10 HCs underwent neuroimaging. Distribution volume (VT) was calculated for in 28 regions of interest (ROIs) using Logan graphical analysis and compared between groups using multiple linear regressions. Group (FM vs HC) was the main predictor of interest and TSPO binding status (high- vs mixed-affinity) was added as a covariate. The FM group had higher VT in the right postcentral gyrus (b = 0.477, P = 0.033), right occipital gray matter (GM; b = 0.438, P = 0.039), and the right temporal GM (b = 0.466, P = 0.042). The FM group also had lower VT than HCs in the left isthmus of the cingulate gyrus (b = -0.553, P = 0.014). In the subgroup of high-affinity binders, the FM group had higher VT in the bilateral precuneus, postcentral gyrus, parietal GM, occipital GM, and supramarginal gyrus. Group differences in the right parietal GM were associated with decreased quality of life, higher pain severity and interference, and cognitive problems. In support of our hypothesis, we found increased radioligand binding (VT) in the FM group compared with HCs in several brain regions regardless of participants' TSPO binding status. The ROIs overlapped with prior reports of increased TSPO binding in FM. Overall, increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that FM involves microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in the brain.

Alteration of diffusion measures in key brain regions depict MPTP/MDMA lesions in the monkey model of PD. Whether dopatherapy impacts such diffusion measures remains an open question. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the consequences of L-DOPA treatment on diffusion alterations, PET imaging and immunohistochemical markers in MPTP/MDMA-intoxicated monkeys. Methods: We acquired PET imaging and measures of mean diffusivity and fractional anisotropy longitudinally and correlated them with behavior and post-mortem fiber quantification. Results: Severity of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia was correlated to serotonin transporter radioligand binding increases in the ventral striatum and the anterior cingulate cortex and decreases of mean diffusivity in the ventral striatum. After lesion of serotonergic fibers by MDMA and the second L-DOPA period, diffusion measures were no more altered while the serotonergic binding still increased in all regions of interest, despite abolition of dyskinesia. Interestingly, in the anterior cingulate cortex, the SERT radioligand binding was negatively correlated to the number of SERT fibers. Conclusion: These results show that the increase of SERT radioligand binding is not systematically paralleled by an increase of SERT fibers and does not always reflect the presence of LID. More specifically, our study suggest that SERT increase may be underpinned by an increased density of serotonergic fibers after MPTP and the first L-DOPA period, and by an elevation of SERT itself after MDMA and the second L-DOPA period. This highlights that DTI is complementary to PET imaging to decipher pathophysiological mechanisms underlying L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in a non-human primate model of PD.

We used a set of allosteric agents to probe whether muscarinic M-2 receptors whose orthosteric site is occupied by an agonist still reveal the common allosteric site that has been identified in M-2 receptors being occupied by an orthosteric antagonist (N-methylscopolamine, NMS). Equilibrium and dissociation binding experiments were carried out in porcine heart homogenates using either the agonist [H-3] oxotremorine M [H-3] or the antagonist [H-3] NMS. The affinities of the allosteric agents were determined for the radioligand-occupied receptor states and, additionally, for the radioligand-free (ground state) M-2 receptor. The archetypal agent W84 (hexane-1,6-bis[dimethyl-3'-phthalimidopropyl-ammonium bromide] and its bispyridinio middle chain analogue WDuo3 (1,3-bis[4-(phthalimidomethoxyimino-methyl)-pyridinium-1-yl]propane dibromide) had a clearly lower affinity for [H-3] OxoM-liganded receptors compared with [H-3] NMS-liganded and ground state receptors. In contrast, a derivative resembling only one half of W84 had equal affinities for both radioligand-occupied receptor states. Also, the agents gallamine and obidoxime did not discriminate between [H-3] OxoM- and [H-3]NMS-occupied receptors. The allosteric antagonistic tool obidoxime inhibited WDuo3 action in [H-3] OxoM-liganded receptors with the same potency as in [H-3] NMS-liganded receptors. We conclude that the common allosteric site is still present in OxoM-liganded M-2 receptors, but its spatial conformation is considerably altered compared with NMS-liganded receptors.

Methods: In total, 652 children aged 2.9 (2.5-4.2) y were analysed for IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG with radioligand-binding assays and IgA endomysial antibodies (EMA) by indirect immunofluorescence. Antibody-positive children were retested after 1.2 (range 0.2-1.9) y. Intestinal biopsy was performed on children with persistently high antibody levels. Results: In total, 3.2% (95% CI: 1.9-4.6%) of the 652 children were positive for at least one antibody at baseline: 2.5% (95% CI: 1.3-3.7%) for IgA-tTG, 1.7% (95% CI: 0.7-2.7%) for IgG-tTG and 2.9% (95% CI: 1.6-4.2%) for IgA-EMA, respectively. Ten children were positive for all three antibodies, five for both IgA-tTG and EMA, four for EMA only, one for IgA-tTG and another for IgG-tTG. IgA-EMA titres correlated with IgA-tTG levels (r = 0.73, p = 0.0003). At follow-up, seven of 20 children remained positive for all three antibodies, three for IgA-tTG only, one for both IgA-tTG and EMA, one for IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG, and the remaining child refused further participation. Three biopsies showed villous atrophy, two increased intraepithelial lymphocytes and two normal findings. Biopsy was not performed in four children with low or declining tTG antibody levels at follow-up and in one child who declined. CD was evident in 0.5% (95% CI: 0.0-1.0%) (3/652). Conclusion: This study revealed a high number of young children positive for tTG antibodies as well as EMA, but the majority showed declining levels in both antibodies over time. We suggest using radioligand-binding assays for quantitative measurement of tTG antibodies when change in antibody levels is studied in young children.

Herein, we describe the radiolabeling and preclinical evaluation of a candidate radioligand for the H-3 receptor, 4-(1S,2S)-2-(4-cyclobutylpiperazine-1-carbonyl)-cyclopropyll-N-methyl-benzamide (5), and its comparison with one of the frontrunner radioligands for H-3 imaging, namely, GSK189254 (1). Compounds I and 5 were radiolabeled with tritium and carbon-11 for in vitro and in-vivo imaging experiments. The in vitro binding of [H-3]1 and [H-3]5 was examined by (i) saturation binding to rat and nonhuman primate brain tissue homogenate and (ii) in vitro autoradiography on tissue sections from rat, guinea pig, and human brain. The in vivo binding of [H-3]1 and [H-3]5 was examined by PET imaging in mice and nonhuman primates. B-max values obtained from Scatchard analysis of [H-3]1 and [H-3]5 binding were in good agreement. Autoradiography with [H-3]5 on rat, guinea pig, and human brain slices showed specific binding in regions known to be enhanced in H-3 receptors, a high degree of colocalization with [H-3]1, and-virtually negligible nonspecific binding in tissue. PET measurements in mice and nonhuman primates demonstrated that [C-11]5 binds specifically and reversibly to H-3 receptors in vivo with low nonspecific binding in brain tissue. Whereas [C-11]1 showed similar binding characteristics in vivo, the binding kinetics appeared faster for [C-11]5 than for [C-11]1. Conclusions: [C-11]5 has suitable properties for quantification of H-3 receptors in nonhuman primate brain and has the potential to offer improved binding kinetics in man compared to [C-11]1.

Propiverine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist possessing additional properties, i.e., block of L-type Ca2+ channels. Here, we have investigated whether propiverine and its metabolites can additionally antagonize alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Human prostate and porcine trigone muscle strips were used to explore inhibition of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated contractile responses. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing cloned human alpha(1)-adrenoceptors were used to determine direct interactions with the receptor in radioligand binding and intracellular Ca2+ elevation assays. Propiverine concentration-dependently reversed contraction of human prostate pre-contracted with 10 mu M phenylephrine (-log IC50 [M] 4.43 +/- A 0.08). Similar inhibition was observed in porcine trigone (-log IC50 5.01 +/- A 0.05), and in additional experiments consisted mainly of reduced maximum phenylephrine responses. At concentrations a parts per thousand yen1 mu M, the propiverine metabolite M-14 also relaxed phenylephrine pre-contracted trigone strips, whereas metabolites M-5 and M-6 were ineffective. In radioligand binding experiments, propiverine and M-14 exhibited similar affinity for the three alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes with -log K (i) [M] values ranging from 4.72 to 4.94, whereas the M-5 and M-6 did not affect [H-3]-prazosin binding. In CHO cells, propiverine inhibited alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated Ca2+ elevations with similar potency as radioligand binding, again mainly by reducing maximum responses. In contrast to other muscarinic receptor antagonists, propiverine exerts additional L-type Ca2+-channel blocking and alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist effects. It remains to be determined clinically, how these additional properties contribute to the clinical effects of propiverine, particularly in male voiding dysfunction.

Radioligand-binding assays were performed and the re suits were compared with those (pKi or pA(2) values) obtained from the membrane-enriched fractions from the rat heart, cerebral cortex, bovine heart, tracheal smooth muscle or guinea-pig heart muscle. The pKi values of pro pranolol, bopindolol, its two metabolites, atenolol, pindolol and metoprolol to beta(1)-AR subtypes obtained from COS 7 cell membranes were 9.02 +/- 0.04, 7.44 +/- 0.12, 9.38 +/- 0.31, 6.65 +/- 0.16, 5.55 +/- 0.14, 8.17 +/- 0.15 and 5.99 +/- 0.13, respectively. The rank order of pKi values for these agents to beta-(2)-ARs in COS-7 cell membranes was the same as that of beta(1)-ARs. In addition, good correlations were observed between pKi values of homogenates from various tissues and those of transfected COS-7 cell membranes to beta(1)- and beta(2)-ARs. Although good correlations were also observed between pA(2) values obtained from tracheal smooth muscle (beta(2)-ARs) and pKi values obtained from transfected COS-7 cell membranes to beta(2)-ARs, low correlation coefficient values to beta(1)-ARs were observed, however. In conclusion, these results suggested that binding characteristics of H-3-CGP-12177 to beta-AR subtypes in these membranes from transfected COS-7 cells are similar to those from membrane fractions of various tissues.

Characterization of a New Positive Allosteric Modulator of AMPA Receptors - PAM-43: Specific Binding of the Ligand and its Ability to Potentiate AMPAR Currents	CURRENT MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Glutamate receptor; allosteric modulation; positive allosteric modulator (PAM); AMPA; NMDA; radioligand; [H-3]PAM; AMPAR currents	IONOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; AGONIST BINDING; DISTINCT MODES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ANTAGONIST; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; EXPRESSION; KINETICS; MEMORY	Background: Currently, the most dynamic areas in the glutamate receptor system neurobiology are the identification and development of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of glutamate ionotropic receptors. PAM-based drugs are of great interest as promising candidates for the treatment of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, etc. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the biological action of natural and synthetic PAMs is a key point for modifying the original chemical compounds as well as for new drug design. Objective: We are trying to elaborate a system of molecular functional screening of ionotropic glutamate receptor probable PAMs. Methods: The system will be based on the radioligand - receptor method of analysis and will allow rapid quantification of new AMPAR probable PAMs molecular activity. We plan to use a tritiumlabeled analogue of recently elaborated ionotropic GluR probable PAM ([H-3]PAM-43) as the main radioligand. Results: Here, we characterized the specific binding of the ligand and its ability to potentiate ionotropic GluR currents. The existence of at least two different sites of [H-3]PAM-43 specific binding has been shown. One of the above sites is glutamate-dependent and is characterized by higher affinity. "Patch-clamp" technique showed the ability of PAM-43 to potentiate ionotropic GluR currents in rat cerebellar Purkinje neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Conclusion: The possibility of using PAM-43 as a model compound to study different allosteric effects of potential regulatory drugs (AMPAR allosteric regulators) was shown. [H-3]PAM-43 based screening system will allow rapid selection of new AMPAR probable PAM structures and quantification of their molecular activity.

Imaging HDACs <i>In Vivo</i>: Cross-Validation of the [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Martinostat Radioligand in the Pig Brain	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Martinostat; Epigenetics; Histone deacetylase; Pig; Western blot; HDAC1; HDAC2; HDAC3; Brain	HISTONE DEACETYLASES; EXPRESSION PATTERNS; TARGETS	Purpose With the emerging knowledge about the impact of epigenetic alterations on behavior and brain disorders, the ability to measure epigenetic alterations in brain tissue in vivo has become critically important. We present the first in vivo/in vitro cross-validation of the novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]Martinostat in the pig brain with regard to its ability to measure histone deacetylase 1-3 (HDAC1-3) levels in vivo. Procedures Nine female Danish landrace pigs underwent 121-min dynamic PET scans with [C-11]Martinostat. We quantified [C-11]Martinostat uptake using both a simple ratio method and kinetic models with arterial input function. By the end of the scan, the animals were euthanized and the brains were extracted. We measured HDAC1-3 protein levels in frontal cortex, cerebellum vermis, and hippocampus and compared the protein levels and regional outcome values to the [C-11]Martinostat PET quantification. Results [C-11]Martinostat distributed widely across brain regions, with the highest uptake in the cerebellum vermis and the lowest in the olfactory bulbs. Based on the Akaike information criterion, the quantification was most reliably performed by Ichise MA1 kinetic modeling, but since the radioligand displayed very slow kinetics, we also calculated standard uptake value (SUV) ratios which correlated well with V-T. The western blots revealed higher brain tissue protein levels of HDAC1/2 compared to HDAC3, and HDAC1 and HDAC2 levels were highly correlated in all three investigated brain regions. The in vivo SUV ratio measure correlated well with the in vitro HDAC1-3 levels, whereas no correlation was found between V-T values and HDAC levels. Conclusions We found good correlation between in vivo measured SUV ratios and in vitro measures of HDAC 1-3 proteins, supporting that [C-11]Martinostat provides a good in vivo measure of the cerebral HDAC1-3 protein levels.

REGULATION OF DOPAMINE D<sub>3</sub> RECEPTOR IN THE STRIATAL REGIONS AND SUBSTANTIA NIGRA IN DIFFUSE LEWY BODY DISEASE	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Parkinson disease; diffuse Lewy body disease; dopamine receptors; quantitative autoradiography	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EARLY PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MESSENGER-RNA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; RAT-BRAIN; 1-METHYL-4-PHENYL-1,2,3,6-TETRAHYDROPYRIDINE MPTP; STRIATONIGRAL DEGENERATION; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND	The regulation of D-3 receptor has not been well documented in diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD). In this study, a novel D-3-preferring radioligand [H-3]WC-10 and a D-2-preferring radioligand [H-3]raclopride were used and the absolute densities of the dopamine D-3 and D-2 receptors were determined in the striatal regions and substantia nigra (SN) from postmortem brains from five cases of DLBD, which included dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 4) and Parkinson disease dementia (PDD, n = 1). The densities of the dopamine D-1 receptor, vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), and dopamine transporter (DAT) were also measured by quantitative autoradiography using [H-3]SCH23390, [H-3]dihydrotetrabenazine, and [H-3]WIN35428, respectively. The densities of these dopaminergic markers were also measured in the same brain regions in 10 age-matched control cases. Dopamine D3 receptor density was significantly increased in the striatal regions including caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens (NAc). There were no significant changes in the dopamine D1 and 132 receptor densities in any brain regions measured. VMAT2 and DAT densities were reduced in all the brain regions measured in DLB/PDD, however, the significant reduction was found in the putamen for DAT and in the NAc and SN for VMAT2. The decrease of dopamine pre-synaptic markers implies neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in these DLB/PDD cases, while the increase of D3 receptors in striatal regions could be attributed to dopaminergic medication history and psychiatric states such as hallucinations. Whether it also reflects compensatory regulation upon dopaminergic denervation warrants further confirmations on larger populations. (C) 2013 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular docking studies revealed that all compounds (23-33) exhibited strong interaction with A(2A)R. The strong interaction of the compounds (23-33) with A(2A)R in silico was confirmed by their high binding affinity with human A(2A)R stably expressed in HEK293 cells using radioligand-binding assay. The compounds 24-26 demonstrated substantial binding affinity and selectivity for A(2A)R as compared to SCH58261, a standard A(2A)R antagonist. Decrease in A(2A)R-coupled release of endogenous cAMP in treated HEK293 cells demonstrated in vitro A(2A)R antagonist potential of the compounds 24-26. Attenuation in haloperidol-induced motor impairments (catalepsy and akinesia) in Swiss albino male mice pre-treated with compounds 24-26 further supports their role in the alleviation of PD symptoms.

Three separate instruments were linked in tandem to perform the following operations: The Genmate and Genesis were linked to perform liquid handling, incubation, and the scheduling operations, while an automated harvester was used to perform rapid filtration. To minimize carryover of compounds, disposable tips were used for diluting and dispensing the compounds. A custom-designed tip holder was used to handle loading and pipetting by the Genmate 96-well pipettor The assay for 84 compounds with six concentrations that spans six logs can be completed within 4 h. The reproducibility of the individual data point (cv < 10% between duplicates) and K-i (cv < 20%) is superior to that determined by manual procedures. K-i values of various dopamine ligands determined by the hands-free procedure are similar to published values. This technology reduces hands-on time (at least 70%), minimizes exposure to radioligands (up to 95%), and improves the reproducibility of results. The technology is applicable for high-throughput screening and rapid determination of structure-activity relationship of compounds for many other membrane-bound receptors.

The preclinical characterization of the PDE10A PET tracer [C-11]MK-8193 is described. In vitro binding studies with [H-3]MK-8193 were conducted in rat, monkey, and human brain tissue. PET studies with [C-11]MK-8193 were conducted in rats and rhesus monkeys at baseline and following administration of a PDE10A inhibitor. [H-3]MK-8193 is a high-affinity, selective PDE10A radioligand in rat, monkey, and human brain tissue. In vivo, [C-11]MK-8193 displays rapid kinetics, low test-retest variability, and a large specific signal that is displaced by a structurally diverse PDE10A inhibitor, enabling the determination of pharmacokinetic/enzyme occupancy relationships. [C-11]MK-8193 is a useful PET tracer for the preclinical characterization of PDE10A therapeutic candidates in rat and monkey. Further evaluation of [C-11]MK-8193 in humans is warranted.

New <i>N</i>-aryl-<i>N</i>′-(3-(substituted)phenyl)-<i>N</i>′-methylguanidines as leads to potential PET radioligands for imaging the open NMDA receptor	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor; Phencyclidine; Positron emission tomography	IN-VITRO EVALUATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; ANTAGONISTS; SUBUNIT; MICE	An expansive set of N-aryl-N'-(3-(substituted)phenyl)-N'-methylguanidines was prepared in a search for new leads to prospective PET ligands for imaging of the open channel of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in vivo. The N-aryl rings and their substituents were varied, whereas the N-methyl group was maintained as a site for potential labeling with the positron-emitter, carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min). At micromolar concentration, over half of the prepared compounds strongly inhibited the binding of [H-3] TCP to its binding site in the open NMDA receptor in vitro. Four ligands displayed affinities that are similar or superior to those of the promising SPECT radioligand ([I-123]CNS1261). The 30-dimethylamino (19; K-i 36.7 nM), 3'-trifluoromethyl (20; K-i 18.3 nM) and 3'-methylthio (2; K-i 39.8 nM) derivatives of N-1-naphthyl-N'-(phenyl)-N'-methylguanidine were identified as especially attractive leads for PET radioligand development.

Previous positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging studies of the translocator protein 18 kDa, TSPO, were limited by low affinity of the first-generation radioligand, low-resolution scanners, and small sample sizes. Moreover, there is a dearth of literature on microglial activation in individuals at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. We used a novel second-generation TSPO radioligand, [F-18] FEPPA, to examine whether microglial activation is elevated in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus of antipsychotic-naive CHR. Twenty-four CHR (antipsychotic-naive n = 22) and 23 healthy volunteers (HV) completed a high resolution [F-18] FEPPA PET scan and MRI. The PET data were analyzed using the validated two-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma input function with total volume of distribution (V-T) as outcome measure. All analyses were controlled for the TSPO rs6971 polymorphism. We did not observe any significant differences in microglial activation, as indexed by [F-18] FEPPA V-T, between CHR and HV in either the DLPFC (F((1, 44)) = 0.41, p = 0.52) or the hippocampus (F((1, 44)) = 2.78, p = 0.10). Exploratory associations show that in CHR, [F-18] FEPPA VT was positively correlated with apathy (DLPFC: r = 0.55, p = 0.008; hippocampus: r = 0.52, p = 0.013) and state anxiety (DLPFC: r = 0.60, p = 0.003; hippocampus: r = 0.48, p = 0.024). The lack of significant group differences in [F-18] FEPPA V-T suggests that microglial activation is not significantly elevated in the clinical high risk state that precedes psychosis.

PSMA-heterogeneity in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer: Circulating tumor cells, metastatic tumor burden, and response to targeted radioligand therapy	PROSTATE			English	Article						CellSearch; circulating tumor cells; prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA); PSMA-617; radioligand therapy	BIOCHEMICAL RECURRENCE; SURVIVAL; ANTIGEN; BIOMARKER; STANDARD; MARKERS; PET	BackgroundWe explored the interrelation between prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression on circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and that of solid metastatic lesions as determined by whole-body PSMA-targeted positron emission tomography (PET) to refine the prediction of response to subsequent PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT). MethodsA prospective study was performed in 20 patients with advanced mCRPC. Of these, 16 underwent subsequent RLT with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 at a dose of 7.4GBq every 6-8 weeks. PSMA expression on CTCs using the CellSearch system was compared to clinical and serological results, and to marker expression in targeted imaging and available histological sections of prostatectomy specimens (19% of RLT patients). Clinical outcome was obtained after two cycles of RLT. ResultsMarked heterogeneity of PSMA expression was observed already at first diagnosis in available histological specimens. Targeted whole-body imaging also showed heterogeneous inter- and intra-patient PSMA expression between metastases. Heterogeneity of CTC PSMA expression was partially paralleled by heterogeneity of whole-body tumor burden PSMA expression. Twenty percent of CTC samples showed no PSMA expression, despite unequivocal PSMA expression of solid metastases at PET. A high fraction of PSMA-negative CTCs emerged as the sole predictor of poor RLT response (odds ratio [OR]: 0.9379 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.8558-0.9902]; p=0.0160), and was prognostic for both shorter progression-free survival (OR: 1.236 [95% CI, 1.035-2.587]; p=0.0043) and overall survival (OR: 1.056 [95% CI, 1.008-1.141]; p=0.0182). ConclusionThis proof-of-principle study suggests that liquid biopsy for CTC PSMA expression is complementary to PET for individual PSMA phenotyping of mCRPC.

Neoadjuvant systemic therapy before definitive local therapy may improve oncological outcomes by targeting the primary tumor and micrometastatic disease. Objective: To evaluate whether a lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand (LuPSMA) can be safely administered to patients with HRLPC before robotassisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) and to describe immediate oncological outcomes. Design, setting,and participants: This was an open-label, single-arm clinical trial. Patients with HRLPC and elevated radioligand uptake on PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography were enrolled. Two or three LuPSMA radioligand doses (7.4 GBq) were given at 2-wk intervals. RARP with lymph node dissection was performed 4 wk after the last LuPSMA dose. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: The rate of surgical complications, operative parameters, changes in functional and quality-of-life measures, and immediate oncological outcomes (histological findings and biochemical response) were measured. Data were analyzed descriptively. Results and limitations: Fourteen patients participated (median age 67 yr). Prostatespecific antigen decreased by 17% (interquartile range [IQR] 9-50%) after two LuPSMA doses and 34% (IQR 11-60%) after three doses. Thirteen patients underwent RARP with no identifiable anatomical changes or intraoperative complications. Four patients (30%) had postoperative complications (pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, urinary leak with urinary tract infection). At 3 mo postoperatively, 12 patients (92%) required one pad or less. Final whole-mount pathology showed positive surgical margins (PSMs) in seven patients (53%) and downgrading to International Society of Urological Pathology grade group 3 in three patients (23%). Treatment-related effects included a clear vacuolated cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei. Conclusions: LuPSMA followed by RARP appears to be surgically safe. While oncological outcomes are pending, continence recovery seems to be unaffected by LuPSMA treatment.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of Ac-225-PSMA TAT and impact on QoL in advanced mCRPC, and to explore predictive biomarkers on pretherapeutic metastatic tissue biopsies. Methods: Observational cohort study including consecutive patients treated with Ac-225-PSMA TAT between February 2016 and July 2018. Primary endpoint was overall survival (OS). Furthermore, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes, radiological response, safety, QoL, and xerostomia were evaluated. Biopsies were analyzed with immunohistochemistry and next-generation sequencing. Results: Thirteen patients were included. Median OS was 8.5 months for the total cohort and 12.6 months for PSMA radioligand therapy-naive patients. PSA declines of >= 90% and >= 50% were observed in 46% and 69% of patients, respectively. Six patients were radiologically evaluable; 50% showed partial response. All patients showed >90% total tumor volume reduction on PET imaging. Patients experienced clinically relevant decrease of pain and QoL improvement in physical and role functioning domains. Xerostomia persisted during follow-up. Patients with high baseline immunohistochemical PSMA expression or DNA damage repair alterations tended to have longer OS. Conclusions: TAT with Ac-225-PSMA resulted in remarkable survival and biochemical responses in advanced mCRPC patients. Patients experienced clinically relevant QoL improvement, although xerostomia was found to be nontransient. Baseline immunohistochemical PSMA expression and DNA damage repair status are potential predictive biomarkers of response to Ac-225-PSMA TAT. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and modulation of learning in 4-and 27-month-old rabbits	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						aging; cerebellum; eyeblink classical conditioning; frontal and temporal-parietal cortex; hippocampus; radioligand binding	MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GALANTAMINE FACILITATES ACQUISITION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CHOLINERGIC INNERVATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; BINDING-SITES; EYEBLINK; BRAIN; ALPHA-7; RAT	Using drugs acting on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), we examined temporal-parietal and frontal cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum to identify sites of cognition enhancement in 4- and 27-month rabbits. First, we compared radioligand receptor binding for neuronal alpha beta heteromeric nAChRs ([H-3] epibatidine) and alpha(7) homomeric nAChRs ([H-3] methyllycaconitine) in rabbits and rats. In cerebellum, nAChR levels of both species are low, about at the detection limit of the radioligand binding assays. Next, we compared nAChRs in 4- and 27-month vehicle-treated rabbits trained in delay eyeblink conditioning. Older rabbits conditioned more poorly and had lower alpha beta heteromeric nAChR binding in hippocampus than young rabbits. For cognition enhancement, galantamine ( mild cholinesterase inhibitor and allosteric modulator of nAChRs) or MEM-3389 (alpha 7nAChR agonist formerly identified as AR-R 17779) was injected before conditioning. Drugs improved learning in both age groups. In 27-month rabbits, drugs increased expression of frontal and temporal-parietal alpha beta heteromeric nAChRs and hippocampal alpha beta and alpha 7nAChRs. In 4-month rabbits, drugs increased expression of alpha 7 homomeric nAChRs in frontal and temporal-parietal cortex and hippocampus, but increased expression of alpha beta heteromeric nAChRs only occurred in temporal- parietal cortex. Increased expression of alpha beta nAChRs was more extensive in older drug-treated rabbits, whereas increased expression of alpha 7nAChRs was more prevalent in younger drug-treated rabbits, suggesting different substrates for amelioration (27-month rabbits) vs facilitation (4-month rabbits) of learning. Results provide evidence for cortical as well as hippocampal nAChR modulation of delay eyeblink conditioning and demonstrate that more sensitive binding assays are required to assess nAChR effects in cerebellum.

Increased vesicular monoamine transporter binding during early abstinence in human methamphetamine users: Is VMAT2 a stable dopamine neuron biomarker?	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						vesicular monoamine transporter 2; positron emission tomography; dihydrotetrabenazine; methamphetamine; dopamine monoamine	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; NERVE-TERMINALS; DYNAMIC PET; AMPHETAMINE; BRAIN; AFFINITY; MARKERS	Animal data indicate that methamphetamine can damage striatal dopamine terminals. Efforts to document dopamine neuron damage in living brain of methamphetamine users have focused on the binding of [C-11] dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), a vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, as a stable dopamine neuron biomarker. Previous PET data report a slight decrease in striatal [ 11C] DTBZ binding in human methamphetamine users after prolonged ( mean, 3 years) abstinence, suggesting that the reduction would likely be substantial in early abstinence. We measured striatal VMAT2 binding in 16 recently withdrawn (mean, 19 d; range, 1-90 d) methamphetamine users and in 14 healthy matched-control subjects during a PET scan with (+)[C-11] DTBZ. Unexpectedly, striatal (+)[C-11]DTBZ binding was increased in methamphetamine users relative to controls (+22%, caudate; +12%, putamen; +11%, ventral striatum). Increased (+)[ 11C] DTBZ binding in caudate was most marked in methamphetamine users abstinent for 1-3 d (+41%), relative to the 7-21 d (+15%) and >21 d (+9%) groups. Above-normal VMAT2 binding in some drug users suggests that any toxic effect of methamphetamine on dopamine neurons might be masked by an increased (+)[C-11] DTBZ binding and that VMAT2 radioligand binding might not be, as is generally assumed, a "stable" index of dopamine neuron integrity in vivo. One potential explanation for increased (+)[C-11] DTBZ binding is that VMAT2 binding is sensitive to changes in vesicular dopamine storage levels, presumably low in drug users. If correct, (+)[C-11] DTBZ might be a useful imaging probe to correlate changes in brain dopamine stores and behavior in users of methamphetamine.

The aim of this study was to investigate [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA in preclinical in vivo experiments and compare its therapeutic efficacy and potential undesired side effects with those of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and the previously developed [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56. BALB/c nude mice without tumors were investigated on Day 10 and 28 after injection of 10 MBq radioligand. It was revealed that most plasma parameters were in the same range for all groups of mice and histopathological examinations of healthy tissue did not show any alternations in treated mice as compared to untreated controls. Based on these results, a therapy study over twelve weeks was conducted with PC-3 PIP tumor-bearing mice for comparison of the radioligands's therapeutic efficacy up to an activity of 10 MBq (1 nmol) per mouse. In agreement with the increased mean absorbed tumor dose, [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA (similar to 6.6 Gy/ MBq) was more effective to inhibit tumor growth than [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (similar to 4.5 Gy/MBq) and only moderately less potent than [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 (similar to 8.1 Gy/MBq). As a result, the survival of mice treated with 2 MBq of an albumin-binding radioligand was significantly increased (p < 0.05) compared to that of mice injected with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 or untreated controls. The majority of mice treated with 5 MBq or 10 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA or [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 were still alive at study end. Hemograms of immunocompetent mice injected with 30 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA or 30 MBq [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 showed values in the same range as untreated controls. This was, however, not the case for mice treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 which revealed a drop in lymphocytes and hemoglobin at Day 10 and Day 28 after injection. The data of this study demonstrated a significant therapeutic advantage of [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA over [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and a more favorable safety profile as compared to that of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56. Based on these results, [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-DAB-PSMA may has the potential for a clinical translation.

Synthesis and Evaluation of a Fluorine-18 Radioligand for Imaging Huntingtin Aggregates by Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Huntington's disease; PET imaging; radiotracer; fluorine-18; [C-11]CHDI	WITTIG REACTION; OLEFINS; DISEASE; TAU	Mutations in the huntingtin gene (HTT) triggers aggregation of huntingtin protein (mHTT), which is the hallmark pathology of neurodegenerative Huntington's disease (HD). Development of a high affinity F-18 radiotracer would enable the study of Huntington's disease pathology using a non-invasive imaging modality, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Herein, we report the first synthesis of fluorine-18 imaging agent, 6-(5-((5-(2,2-difluoro-2-(fluoro-F-18)ethoxy)pyridin-2-yl)methoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-2-methylpyridazin-3(2H)-one ([F-18]1), a radioligand for HD and its preclinical evaluation in vitro (autoradiography of post-mortem HD brains) and in vivo (rodent and non-human primate brain PET). [F-18]1 was synthesized in a 4.1% RCY (decay corrected) and in an average molar activity of 16.5 +/- 12.5 GBq/mu mol (445 +/- 339 Ci/mmol). [F-18]1 penetrated the blood-brain barrier of both rodents and primates, and specific saturable binding in post-mortem brain slices was observed that correlated to mHTT aggregates identified by immunohistochemistry.

A radioligand that could be used with PET to image and quantify human brain. NMDA receptors in the activated "open channel" state would be useful for research on such disorders and for the development of novel therapies,: To date, no radioligands have Shown well-validated efficacy for imaging NMDA receptors in human subjects. In order to discover improved radioligands for PET imaging, we explored structure affinity relationships in N'-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl derivatives of N-aryl-N'-methylguanidines, seeking high affinity and moderate lipophilicity, plus necessary amenability for labeling with a positron-emitter, either carbon-11 or fluorine-18. Among a diverse set of 80 prepared N'-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl derivatives, four of these compounds (13, 19, 20, and 36) displayed desirable low nanomolar affinity for inhibition of [H-3](+)-MK801 at the PCP binding site and are of interest for candidate PET radioligand development.

William			Characterization of peripheral human cannabinoid receptor (hCB2) expression and pharmacology using a novel radioligand, [<SUP>35</SUP>S]Sch225336	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CB2 RECEPTOR; HL-60 CELLS; PHENYLMETHYLSULFONYL FLUORIDE; SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR; SELECTIVE ANTAGONIST; GROWTH-FACTOR; IN-VIVO; ANANDAMIDE; RAT; BINDING	Studies to characterize the endogenous expression and pharmacology of peripheral human cannabinoid receptor (hCB2) have been hampered by the dearth of authentic anti-hCB2 antibodies and the lack of radioligands with CB2 selectivity. We recently described a novel CB2 inverse agonist, N-[1(S)-[4-[[4- methoxy2-[(4-methoxyphenyl) sulfonyl] phenyl] sulfonyl] phenyl] ethyl] methane-sulfonamide (Sch225336), that binds hCB2 with high affinity and excellent selectivity versus hCB1. The precursor primary amine of Sch225336 was prepared and reacted directly with [S-35] mesyl chloride ( synthesized from commercially obtained [S-35] methane sulfonic acid) to generate [S-35] Sch225336. [ 35S] Sch225336 has high specific activity (> 1400 Ci/mmol) and affinity for hCB2( 65 pM). Using [S-35] Sch225336, we assayed hemopoietic cells and cell lines to quantitate the expression and pharmacology of hCB2. Lastly, we used [S-35] Sch225336 for detailed autoradiographic analysis of CB2 in lymphoid tissues. Based on these data, we conclude that [S-35] Sch225336 represents a unique radioligand for the study of CB2 endogenously expressed in blood cells and tissues.

J	Deyrup, AT; Tretiakova, M; Montag, AG				Deyrup, AT; Tretiakova, M; Montag, AG			Estrogen receptor-β expression in extraabdominal fibromatoses -: An analysis of 40 cases	CANCER			English	Article						estrogen receptor (ER); radioligand; immunohistochemical; estrogen receptor-beta; fibromatosis; desmoid	FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS; ANTIESTROGEN-BINDING-SITES; DESMOID TUMORS; AGGRESSIVE FIBROMATOSIS; ER-BETA; CATENIN; THERAPY; BREAST; PROGESTERONE; MUTATIONS	BACKGROUND. Early experiments using ligand-binding assays demonstrated the presence of estrogen receptor (ER) in fibromatoses. These findings were not confirmed by later studies using immunohistochemical analysis. METHODS. To verify the expression of Ells in fibromatosis as well as to clarify the inconsistency between radioligand and early immunohistochemical studies, the authors examined a series of 40 extraabdominal fibromatoses using antibodies raised against ERP. RESULTS. All 40 cases of extraabdominal fibromatosis were at least focally positive for ER beta. Thirty-three of 40 (83%) displayed 3+ (> 50%) expression, 5 of 40 (12%) were 2+ (11-50%), and 2 of 40 (5%) cases showed 1+ (< 10%) expression. All cases were negative for ER alpha. CONCLUSIONS. Although extraabdominal fibromatosis does not express ER alpha, there appears to be nearly uniform expression of ERP. This finding clarifies discrepancies in the literature regarding estrogen expression in fibromatosis, and provides a biological mechanism for the action of antiestrogenic compounds in the treatment of fibromatosis. Estrogen antagonists may have a role in the treatment of refractory or recurrent extraabdominal fibromatoses.

All compounds were inactive in D-1 dopamine radioligand binding assay. The 2-(1-naphthyl)ethyl analogues expressed a low but significant binding affinity for the D-2 and moderate one for the 5-HT1A receptor subtypes. Most of the remaining compounds expressed binding affinity at the 5-HT1A receptor subtype but were inactive in D-2 receptor binding assay. Based on these results and considering the chemical characteristics of the compounds synthesized and evaluated for dopaminergic and serotonergic activity throughout the present study it can be concluded that hydrophobic type of interaction (stacking or edge-to-face) plays a significant role in the formation of receptor-ligand complexes of 2-(1-naphthyl)ethyl amines. This structural motive can be applied to design and synthesize new, more potent dopaminergic/serotonergic ligands by slight chemical modifications.

Synthesis and evaluation of 1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-<i>c</i>]pyrimidine derivatives as A<sub>2A</sub> receptor-selective antagonists	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Nucleoside; G Protein-coupled receptor; Molecular modelling; Adenosine receptor; Radioligand binding	ADENOSINE RECEPTOR; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; POTENT; RADIOLIGAND; RAT; DESIGN; BRAIN	Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease are serious life-limiting and debilitating movement disorders. Their onset typically occurs from mid-life to late in life, and effective diagnostic techniques for detecting and following the disease course are lacking. Our goal is to develop receptor imaging agents for positron emission tomography (PET) that selectively target the most relevant subtype of adenosine receptors (AR) that are highly expressed in the striatum, that is, the A(2A) AR. To further this goal, we have synthesized and characterized pharmacologically a family of high affinity A(2A) AR ligands, based on the known antagonist, SCH 442416 (R = -Me), which have structural variability on the terminus (R = -Et, -i-Pr, -allyl, and others). A O-fluoroethyl analogue suitable for use as a PET tracer had a K-i value of 12.4 nM and was highly selective for the A(2A) AR in comparison to the A(1) and A(3) ARs. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The opioid and cannabinoid pharmacophores were coupled via spacers of different length and chemical structure. In vitro radioligand binding experiments confirmed that the resulting bivalent compounds bound both to the opioid and to the cannabinoid receptors with moderate to high affinity. The highest affinity bivalent derivatives 11 and 19 exhibited agonist properties in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays. These compounds activated MOR and CB (11 mainly CB2, whereas 19 mainly CB1) receptor-mediated signaling, as it was revealed by experiments using receptor specific antagonists. In rats both 11 and 19 exhibited antiallodynic effect similar to the parent drugs in 20 mu g dose at spinal level. These results support the strategy of multitargeting G-protein coupled receptors to develop lead compounds with antinociceptive properties. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Recently, several [C-11]PK11195 analogues have been synthesized to improve binding stability and brain availability. [F-18]VC701 was synthesized and validated in CD healthy rats by biodistribution and inhibition analysis. Imaging studies were also conducted on animals injected unilaterally in the striatum with quinolinic acid (QA) to evaluate the TSPO ligand uptake in a neuroinflammation/neurodegenerative model. [F-18]VC701 was synthesized with a good chemical and radiochemical purity and specific activity higher than 37 GBq/mu mol. Kinetic studies performed on healthy animals showed the highest tracer biodistribution in TSPO-rich organs, and preadministration of cold PK11195 caused an overall radioactivity reduction. Metabolism studies showed the absence of radio-metabolites in the rat brain of QA lesioned rats, and biodistribution analysis revealed a progressive increase in radioactivity ratios (lesioned to nonlesioned striatum) during time, reaching an approximate value of 5 4 hours after tracer injection. These results encourage further evaluation of this TSPO radioligand in other models of central and peripheral diseases.

Paired saturation binding experiments with [H-3]prazosin and [H-3]tamsulosin were performed in membrane preparations from rat liver and Rat-1 fibroblasts stably transfected with wild-type hamster alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors or a constitutively active mutant thereof. In all three settings [H-3]tamsulosin labeled significantly fewer alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors than [H-3]prazosin. In noradrenaline competition binding experiments, the percentage of agonist low affinity sites was smallest for the constitutively active alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor but the percentage of agonist low affinity sites recognized by [H-3]tamsulosin and [H-3]prazosin did not differ significantly. We conclude that [H-3]tamsulosin labels fewer alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors than [H-3]prazosin but this is not fully explained by a poorer labeling of agonist low affinity sites.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluorovinpocetine, a potential PET radioligand for TSPO imaging	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						PET; TSPO radioligands; Vinpocetine; Monkey; Fluorine-18; Kinetics; Radiometabolites	PROTEIN 18 KDA; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; BRAIN UPTAKE; LIGAND; NEUROINFLAMMATION; VINPOCETINE; MICROGLIA; BINDING; MONKEY	Despite of various PET radioligands targeting the translocator protein TSPO 18-KDa are used for the investigations of neuroinflammatory conditions associated with neurological disorders, development of new TSPO radiotracers is still an active area of the researches with a major focus on the F-18-labelled radiotracers. Here, we report the radiochemical synthesis of [F-18]vinpocetine, fluorinated analogue of previously reported TSPO radioligand, [C-11]vinpocetine. Radiolabeling was achieved by [F-18]fluoroethylation of apovincaminic acid with [F-18]fluoroethyl bromide. [F-18]vinpocetine was obtained in quantities >2.7 GBq in RCY of 13% (non-decay corrected), and molar activity >60 GBq/mu mol within 95 min synthesis time. Preliminary PET studies in a cynomolgus monkey and metabolite studies by HPLC demonstrated similar results by [F-18]vinpocetine as for [C-11]vinpocetine, including high blood-brain barrier permeability, regional uptake pattern and fast washout from the NHP brain. These results demonstrate that [F-18]fluorovinpocetine warrants further evaluation as an easier accessible alternative to [C-11]vinpocetine.

Based on these data as selection criteria, radiosynthesis of N-[6-(3,4-dioxo-2-{3-[3-(piperidin-1-ylmethyl)phenoxy]propylamino}cyclobut-1-enylamino)hexyl]-(2,3-H-3(2))propionic amide ([H-3]UR-DE257) was performed. The radioligand (specific activity: 63Cimmol(-1)) had high affinity for human, rat, and guinea pig H2R (hH(2)R, Sf9 cells: K-d, saturation binding: 31nM, kinetic studies: 20nM). UR-DE257 revealed high H2R selectivity on membranes of Sf9 cells, expressing the respective hH(x)R subtype (K-i values: hH(1)R: >10000nM, hH(2)R: 28nM, hH(3)R: 3800nM, hH(4)R: >10000nM). In spite of insurmountable antagonism, probably due to rebinding of [H-3]UR-DE257 to the H2R (extended residence time), the title compound proved to be a valuable pharmacological tool for the determination of H2R affinities in competition binding assays.

Lipid bilayers were composed of brain phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylserine (PS). IMI binding isotherms were measured up to IMI concentration of 0.5 mmol/l. Due to electrostatic attraction, binding between the positively charged IMI and the negatively charged surfaces of PS membranes was augmented compared to binding to neutral PC membranes. After correction for electrostatic effects by means of the Gouy-Chapman theory, the binding isotherms were described both by surface partition coefficients and by binding parameters (association constants and binding capacities). It was confirmed that binding of IMI to model membranes is strongly affected by negatively charged. phospholipids and that the binding is heterogeneous; in fact, weak surface adsorption and incorporation of the drug into the hydrophobic core of lipid bilayer can be seen and characterized. These results support the hypothesis suggesting that the lipid part of biological membranes plays a role in the mechanism of antidepressant action.

This phenomenon occurs when a bulky tumor accumulates so much radiopharmaceutical that uptake of the agent significantly decreases in healthy organs-at-risk of radiation-related damage. We assessed the tumor sink effects of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiopharmaceuticals via three within-patient comparisons in 33 men with mCRPC given two cycles of lutetium-177-PSMA-617 RLT. The comparisons involved changes in the relationships between total lesion PSMA, reflecting the body's overall tumor burden, and/or the mean standardized uptake value, reflecting radiopharmaceutical accumulation, in the parotid salivary glands, spleen, liver, and kidney. Tumor sink effects were found in the salivary glands and spleen, and possibly the liver. These findings support everyday use and additional study of individualized lutetium-177-PSMA-617 activities adjusted based on tumor burden changes over the course of RLT in men with advanced prostate cancer, to try to improve the efficacy/toxicity ratio."Tumor sink effects", decreased physiological uptake of radiopharmaceuticals due to sequestration by a tumor, may impact radioligand therapy (RLT) toxicity and dosing. We investigated these effects with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radiopharmaceuticals in the healthy organs-at-risk (the parotid glands, kidneys, liver, and spleen) of 33 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We retrospectively performed three intra-individual comparisons. First, we correlated changes from baseline to post-RLT (after two 177-lutetium (177Lu)-PSMA-617 cycles) in total lesional PSMA ( increment TLP) and organ mean standardized uptake values ( increment SUVmean). Second, in 25 RLT responders, we compared the organ SUVmean post-RLT versus that at baseline. Lastly, we correlated the baseline TLP and organ SUVmean. Data were acquired via 68-gallium-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography before the first and after the second 177Lu-PSMA-617 cycle. In the parotid glands and spleen, increment TLP and increment SUVmean showed a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.40, p = 0.023 and r = -0.36, p = 0.042, respectively). Additionally, in those tissues, the median organ SUVmean rose significantly from baseline after the response to RLT (p =0.022), and the baseline TLP and SUVmean were significantly negatively correlated (r = -0.44, p = 0.01 and r = -0.42, p = 0.016, respectively). These observations suggest tumor sink effects with PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals in the salivary glands and spleen of patients with mCRPC.

In this study, we describe the synthesis, radiolabelling and in vitro evaluation of [H-3]-1 for the characterisation of GPR139 and its spatial expression in the brain using autoradiography. Two different synthesis routes for the radiolabelling of 1 based on a reductive debromination strategy were investigated using deuterium (D-2, g). The route based on reductive debromination of the bromonaphthyl precursor 5 proved superior over arylbromide 4 and was employed for the radiolabelling experiments. Reductive debromination of precursor 5 was accomplished using H-3(2), Pd/C and triethylamine in DMF at ambient temperature to give target molecule [H-3]-1 with a specific activity of 19.3 Ci mmol(-1) and a radiochemical purity of >= 95%. By application of autoradiography and binding studies, it was not possible to discriminate [H-3]-1 binding to wildtype mice brains from GPR139 knockout mice brains and total binding from non-specific binding in CHO-k1 cells stably expressing human GPR139 receptor. Based on these experiments we conclude that [H-3]-1 is not a suitable radioligand for the characterisation of GPR139.

Their benefits have been evident since the late 1950s, and they continue to contribute major insights into transporter function and structure to date. In the current chapter, we focus primarily on the family of monoamine (MA) neurotransmitter transporters (MATs), i.e., transporters (T) for norepinephrine [noradrenaline] (NET), dopamine (DAT), and serotonin [5-hydroxy tryptamine, 5-HT] (SERT), dysfunction of which has been linked to numerous neuropsychiatric disorders and substance abuse. Radiotracer assays have provided a major way of elucidating the mechanisms of action of not only endogenous substrates (e.g., NE, SER, and DA), but also many diverse substances such as antidepressants (e.g., imipramine and citalopram), psychostimulants (e.g., amphetamine and cocaine), toxins (e.g., conotoxins), or neurotoxins (e.g., 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, MPP+) that exert their action on MATs. In this chapter we describe the basic principles and experimental procedures of radiotracer assays commonly used in the studies of MATs.

It is a potent therapeutic target for psychiatric and neurological diseases, e.g. schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Since no specific fluorinated radioligand has yet been successfully used to study this receptor by positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging, the objective of the present study was to study the first 5-HT6 F-18-labelled radiotracer. 2FNQ1P, inspired by the quinolone core of a previous radiotracer candidate, GSK215083, was selected according its 5-HT6 affinity and selectivity and was radiolabelled by F-18 nucleophilic substitution. The cerebral distribution of [F-18]2FNQ1P was studied in vivo in rats, cats and macaque monkeys. The chemical and radiochemical purities of [F-18]2FNQ1P were > 98 %. In rats, in vitro competition with the 5-HT6 antagonist, SB258585, revealed that the radioligand was displaced dose dependently. Rat microPET studies showed low brain uptake of [F-18]2FNQ1P, reversed by the P-glycoprotein inhibitor, cyclosporin. On the contrary, PET scans in cats showed good brain penetration and specific striatal binding blocked after pretreatment with unlabelled 2FNQ1P. PET scans in macaque monkeys confirmed high specific binding in both cortical and subcortical regions, specifically decreased by pretreatment with the 5-HT6 receptor antagonist, SB258585. 2FNQ1P was initially selected because of its suitable characteristics for 5-HT6 receptor probing in vitro in terms of affinity and specificity. Although in vivo imaging in rats cannot be considered as predictive of the clinical characteristics of the radiotracer, [F-18]2FNQ1P appeared to be a suitable 5-HT6 PET tracer in feline and primate models. These preclinical results encourage us to pursue the clinical development of this first fluorinated 5-HT6 PET radiotracer.

It was our goal to radiolabel the alpha 7 nAChR agonist 4-[5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-[1,3,4]oxadiazol-2-yl]-1,4-diaza-bicyclo[3.2.2]nonane (NS10743) and to assess the selectivity of [F-18]NS10743 binding site occupancy in animal experiments. [F-18]NS10743 was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution of the nitro precursor. In vitro receptor affinity and selectivity were assessed by radioligand competition and autoradiography. The radiotracer properties were evaluated in female CD-1 mice by brain autoradiography and organ distribution. Target specificity was validated after treatment with SSR180711 (10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), and metabolic stability was investigated using radio-HPLC. The specific activity of [F-18]NS10743 exceeded 150 GBq/mu mol at a radiochemical purity > 99%. In vitro, NS10743 and [F-18]NS10743 showed high affinity and specificity towards alpha 7 nAChR. The brain permeation of [F-18]NS10743 was fast and sufficient with values of 4.83 and 1.60% injected dose per gram and brain to plasma ratios of 3.83 and 2.05 at 5 and 60 min after radiotracer administration. Brain autoradiography and organ distribution showed target-specific accumulation of [F-18]NS10743 in brain substructures and various alpha 7 nAChR-expressing organs. The radiotracer showed a high metabolic stability in vivo with a single polar radiometabolite, which did not cross the blood-brain barrier. The good in vitro and in vivo features of [F-18]NS10743 make this radioligand a promising candidate for quantitative in vivo imaging of alpha 7 nAChR expression and encourage further investigations.

Kinetic analysis in healthy humans of a novel positron emission tomography radioligand to image the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, a potential biomarker for inflammation	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						compartmental analysis; microglia; distribution volume; Monte Carlo simulation; aryloxyanilide	HUMAN-BRAIN; BINDING-SITES; PET; DAA1106; MODEL; RAT; MICROGLIA; LIGANDS	The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is upregulated on activated microglia and macrophages and thereby is a useful biomarker of inflammation. We developed a novel PET radioligand, [C-11]PBR28, that was able to image and quantify PBRs in healthy monkeys and in a rat model of stroke. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of [C-11]PBR28 to quantify PBRs in brain of healthy human subjects. Twelve subjects had PET scans of 120 to 180 min duration as well as serial sampling of arterial plasma to measure the concentration of unchanged parent radioligand. One- and two-tissue compartmental analyses were performed. To obtain stable estimates of distribution volume, which is a summation of B-max/K-D and nondisplaceable activity, 90 min of brain imaging was required. Distribution volumes in human were only similar to 5% of those in monkey. This comparatively low amount of receptor binding required a two-rather than a one-compartment model, suggesting that nonspecific binding was a sizeable percentage compared to specific binding. The time-activity curves in two of the twelve subjects appeared as if they had no PBR binding-i.e., rapid peak of uptake and fast washout from brain. The cause(s) of these unusual findings are unknown, but both subjects were also found to lack binding to PBRs in peripheral organs such as lung and kidney. In conclusion, with the exception of those subjects who appeared to have no PBR binding, [C-11] PBR28 is a promising ligand to quantify PBRs and localize inflammation associated with increased densities of PBRs.

In a survey of 60 receptors, azimilide at 10 muM inhibited binding by more than 50% at serotonin uptake (K-i: 0.6 muM), muscarinic (K-i: 0.9 to -3.0 muM), Na+ channel site 2 (K-i: 4.3 muM), and central sigma (K-i: 6.2 muM) sites. Lesser (20-40%) inhibition was seen at adrenergic, histamine, serotonin, purinergic, angiotensin II, dopamine uptake, and norepinephrine sites and at a voltage-sensitive K+ channel. In rat ventricle, azimilide inhibited binding to alpha (1)- and beta -adrenergic and muscarinic receptors (K-i: <5 muM) and to the L-type Ca2+ channel (K-i: 37.3 muM). In rat brain, azimilide blocked ligand binding to these same receptors and to a serotonin receptor, and the breadth and potency of its interaction pattern differentiated it from ten other class HI antiarrhythmics. Azimilide displayed agonist and antagonist action at five muscarinic. receptor subtypes in transfected. NIH 3T3 cells producing receptor-sensitive mitogenesis and beta -galactosidase activity. Agonist action predominated at M-2 and M-4 subtypes, and antagonist action predominated at M-1 M-3 and M-5 subtypes. The azimilide concentration for 50% maximum stimulation (EC50) in M-2-expressing cells was 1.97 muM (vs 0.14 muM for carbachol). Azimilide's receptor interactions occur at concentrations from one to forty times those required to block cardiac delayed-rectifier channels but could contribute to the efficacy and safety of the drug.

In this single-photon emission computed tomography study, 7 healthy dogs were used to investigate the influence of ketamine on the regional cerebral blood flow using technetium-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer and on the binding of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor radioligand iodine-123 labeled R91150 in the canine brain. Ketamine increased the regional perfusion in the left frontal cortex and right parietal cortex. Significant changes in the distribution of iodine-123 labeled R91150 were not observed. This study demonstrated an acute effect of ketamine on the regional brain perfusion but not on the 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors in the canine brain in the dose used in this study.

Owing to the long-lasting, high tumoral uptake of Cu-64-DOTHA(2)-PSMA, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of Cu-64-DOTHA(2)-PSMA in vivo. MethodsLNCaP tumor-bearing NOD-Rag1(null)IL2rg(null) (NRG) mice were treated with an intraveinous single-dose of Cu-64-DOTHA(2)-PSMA at maximal tolerated injected activity, Cu-nat-DOTHA(2)-PSMA at equimolar amount (control) or lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-PSMA-617 at 120 MBq to assess their impact on survival. Weight, well-being and tumor size were followed until mice reached 62 days post-injection or ethical limits. Toxicity was assessed through weight, red blood cells (RBCs) counts, pathology and dosimetry calculations. ResultsSurvival was longer with Cu-64-DOTHA(2)-PSMA than with Cu-nat-DOTHA(2)-PSMA (p < 0.001). Likewise, survival was also longer when compared to Lu-177-PSMA-617, although it did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). RBCs counts remained within normal range for the Cu-64-DOTHA(2)-PSMA group. Cu-64-DOTHA(2)-PSMA treated mice showed non-pathological fibrosis and no other signs of radiation injury. Human extrapolation of dosimetry yielded an effective dose of 3.14 x 10(-2) mSv/MBq, with highest organs doses to gastrointestinal tract and liver. DiscussionCollectively, our data showed that Cu-64-DOTHA(2)-PSMA-directed radioligand therapy was effective for the treatment of LNCaP tumor-bearing NRG mice with acceptable toxicity and dosimetry. The main potential challenge is the hepatic and gastrointestinal irradiation.

[C-11]PE2I is an established radioligand that provides high-contrast delineation of brain regions that are rich in DAT. The aim of the present PET study in eight patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) was to evaluate the kinetics of [C-11]PE2I in the brain and to compare binding parameters with those of age-matched control subjects (n = 6). Each patient participated in 90-minute PET measurements with [C-11]PE2I. Data were analyzed using kinetic compartment analyses with metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input and reference tissue models using the cerebellum as a reference region. The time-activity curves were well described by the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) for the DAT-rich regions. The 2TCM with fixed K-1/k(2) ratio derived from the cerebellum provided robust and reliable estimates of binding potential (BPND) and total distribution volume (V-T). The reference tissue models also provided robust estimates of BPND, although they gave lower BPND values than the kinetic analysis. Compared with those of control subjects, we found that BPND values obtained by all approaches were reduced in the midbrain of the patients with JME. The finding indicates impaired dopamine uptake in the midbrain of JME patients. The three-tissue compartment model could best describe uptake in the cerebellum, indicating that two kinetically distinguishable compartments exist in cerebellar tissue, which may correspond to nonspecific binding and the blood-brain barrier passing metabolite.

J	Krohn, KA				Krohn, KA			The physical chemistry of ligand-receptor binding identifies some limitations to the analysis of receptor images	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Receptor 2000 Symposium	APR, 2000	LA JOLLA, CALIFORNIA			kinetic modeling; ligand-receptor thermodynamics; diffusion; beta-adrenergic ligands; superoxide dismutase; epidermal growth factor	CONSTANTS	The biophysical chemistry of ligand-receptor interactions imposes some restrictions on the characteristics of a radioligand if it is to be a useful tracer for accurately measuring the in vivo concentration of a specific cellular membrane receptor. This review discusses thermodynamic and kinetic late constant considerations in selecting a ligand for radiolabeling and imaging. When radioligands of only modest specific activity are injected, one is able to use kinetic analysis to calculate the rate constant for the bimolecular binding reaction as well as the receptor concentration. Images of regional receptor density can be constructed from analysis of emission imaging data when the binding occurs at a rate that is slower than the collision frequency. A tracer that reacts with each collision cannot distinguish receptor density from blood flow. The theory of diffusion-limited reactions is reviewed and individual ligand-receptor examples are presented to demonstrate conditions where, even fur very fast forward reactions, the binding of radioligand to receptor is controlled by local biochemistry rather than by the purely physical process of diffusion.

[Ga-68]PSMA-HBED-CC is a PET radiotracer suitable for detection of PCa, and its clinical use has become widespread over the last few years. In this contribution, we detail our GMP-compliant production of [Ga-68]PSMA-HBED-CC using the Trasis miniAllinOne radiosynthesizer and report synthetic and clinical data for the first 100 productions of 2019. Additionally, we detail our efforts towards a GMP-compliant production of the radiotherapeutic [Lu-177]PSMA-I&T using the same synthesis module. PSMA-based radioligand therapy (RLT) offers a possible future treatment in cases of metastatic castration-resistant PCa, and GMP-compliant routine production methods are therefore called for. This report highlights how PSMA-based agents for theranostic purposes can be conveniently produced at a single radiochemistry Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) site, thereby facilitating optimized detection and treatment of PCa.

Herein we report the synthesis, radiofluorination, and evaluation of a new S1R ligand 6-(3-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(azepan-1-yl)ethyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one ([F-18]FTC-146, [F-18]13). [F-18]13 was synthesized by nucleophilic fluorination, affording a product with >99% radiochemical purity (RCP) and specific activity (SA) of 2.6 +/- 1.2 Ci/mu mol (n = 13) at end of synthesis (EOS). Positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo autoradiography studies of [F-18]13 in mice showed high uptake of the radioligand in S1R rich regions of the brain. Pretreatment with 1 mg/kg haloperidol (2), nonradioactive 13, or BD1047 (18) reduced the binding of [F-18]13 in the brain at 60 min by 80%, 82%, and 81%, respectively, suggesting that [F-18]13 accumulation in mouse brain represents specific binding to S1Rs. These results indicate that [F-18]13 is a promising candidate radiotracer for further evaluation as a tool for studying S1Rs in living subjects.

These new leads belong to a larger set including both commercially or otherwise available potential candidates found by proprietary database searches using 3D-pharmacophore models as query, and several bis-benzamidino compounds selected from our tryptase-like protease inhibitor library on the basis of topological considerations, derived from the same models. Some of these compounds show functional competitive antagonistic activity, inhibiting in vitro the BK-induced contraction of isolated guinea-pig ileum (GPI) and rat uterus with a pA(2) up to 5.3 and 7.0, respectively. They display also binding affinity (IC50 up to 0.56 mu M) to the BK B-2-receptor in radioligand binding assays on GPI membrane preparations and on human IMR-90 fetal lung fibroblast cells expressing this receptor subtype. Furthermore, the results with the commercially available compounds, in some cases developed as therapeutics, show that the used 3D-pharmacophore model allows to predict to some certainty possible side actions of potential drugs.

[<SUP>125</SUP>I]AT-1012, a new high affinity radioligand for the α3β4 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Alpha3beta4; AT-1012; Receptor binding; In vitro autoradiography	INTERPEDUNCULAR NUCLEUS; COMPARATIVE PHARMACOLOGY; CHOLINERGIC-RECEPTORS; MOUSE-BRAIN; BINDING; RAT; 18-METHOXYCORONARIDINE; EPIBATIDINE; NULL; IBOGAINE	Recent genetic and pharmacological studies have implicated the alpha 3, beta 4 and alpha 5 subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in dependence to nicotine and other abused drugs and nicotine withdrawal. The alpha 3 beta 4* nAChR subtype has been shown to co-assemble with the alpha 5 or beta 3 nAChR subunits, and is found mainly in the autonomic ganglia and select brain regions. It has been difficult to study the alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR because there have been no selective nonpeptidic ligands available to independently examine its pharmacology. We recently reported the synthesis of a [I-125]-radiolabeled analog of a high affinity, selective small-molecule alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR ligand, AT-1012. We report here the vitro characterization of this radioligand in receptor binding and in vitro autoradiographic studies targeting the alpha 3 beta 4* nAChR. Binding of [I-125]AT-1012 was characterized at the rat alpha 3 beta 4 and alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR transfected into HEM cells, as well as at the human alpha 3 beta 4 alpha 5 nAChR in HEK cells. Binding affinity of [I-125]AT-1012 at the rat alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR was 1.4 nM, with a B-max of 10.3 pmol/mg protein, similar to what was determined for unlabeled AT-1012 using [H-3]epibatidine. Saturation isotherms suggested that [I-125]AT-1012 binds to a single site on the alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR. Similar high binding affinity was also observed for [I-125]AT-1012 at the human alpha 3 beta 4 alpha 5 nAChR transfected into HEM cells. [I-125]AT-1012 did not bind with high affinity to membranes from alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR-transfected HEM cells. Binding studies with [3H]epibatidine further confirmed that AT-1012 had over 100-fold binding selectivity for alpha 3 beta 4 over alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. K-i values determined for known nAChR compounds using [I-125]AT-1012 as radioligand were comparable to those obtained with [H-3]epibatidine. [I-125]AT-1012 was also used to label alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR in rat brain slices in vitro using autoradiography, which showed highly localized binding of the radioligand in brain regions consistent with the discreet localization of the alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR. We demonstrate that [I-125]AT-1012 is an excellent tool for labeling the alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR in the presence of other nAChR subtypes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, we report on an early experience of177Lu-PSMA therapy with an evaluation of its efficacy and safety in mCRPC patients. Twenty-one mCRPC patients with a mean age of 70.3 +/- 9.6 (54-88)-year-old were treated with one to four therapy cycles (median two cycles) and administered activity of 3.7-29.6 GBq (mean of 15.4 GBq). A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline >= 50% was considered to be a biochemical response (BCR). To evaluate the clinical response, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status was used. Within 2 weeks before and 1 and 2 months after each therapy cycle, hematology, renal function, liver status, alkaline phosphatase, and PSA were checked. The Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events was used for grading adverse events induced by177Lu-PSMA. Furthermore, overall survival (OS) was calculated and analyzed. During the treatment, a BCR was seen in 62% of patients; 19% of patients showed progression and 19% of patients showed stable disease. ECOG status was improved after treatment, and OS was 62.7 weeks. After the treatment, two patients showed Grade II toxicity of white blood cells, Grade I thrombocytopenia was observed in two patients, one patient showed Grade II toxicity in serum creatinine and transient Grade I toxicity in creatinine was seen in two patients. In total, our initial experience demonstrates that177Lu-PSMA therapy has the potential to positively affect the development and maturation of radioligand practices in selected mCRPC patients, even in resource limited, developing country environments. However, some challenges, such as practitioner training, poor initial acceptance by colleagues and financial concerns, particularly in developing nations, still exist.

Experimental and clinical data have indicated that adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists can provide symptomatic improvement by potentiating L-DOPA efficacy and minimizing its side effects. It is known that the G-protein-coupled adenosine A(2A), cannabinoid CB1 and dopamine D-2 receptors may interact and form functional A(2A)-CB1-D-2 receptor heteromers in co-transfected cells as well as in rat striatum. These data suggest that treatment with a combination of drugs or a single compound selectively acting on A(2A)-CB1-D-2 heteromers may represent an alternative therapeutic treatment of PD. We investigated the expression of A(2A)-CB1-D-2 receptor heteromers in the striatum of both naIve and hemiparkinsonian rats (HPD-rats) bearing a unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine (6-0HDA) lesion, and assessed how receptor heteromer expression and biochemical properties were affected by L-DOPA treatment. Radioligand binding data showed that A(2A)-CB1-D-2 receptor heteromers are present in the striatum of both na ve and HPD-rats. However, behavioral results indicated that the combined administration of A(2A) (MSX-3 or SCH58261) and CB1 (rimonabant) receptor antagonists, in the presence of L-DOPA does not produce a response different from administration of the A(2A) receptor antagonist alone. These behavioral results prompted identification of heteromers in L-DOPA-treated animals. Interestingly, the radioligand binding results in samples from lesioned animals suggest that the heteromer is lost following acute or chronic treatment with L-DOPA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

MAFB filter plates (GF/B filter over a Durapore membrane) were used because of the lower nonspecific binding of the radioligand to GF/B filter material than to GF/C filters, Comparing different scintillation cocktails, highest counting efficiency and shortest equilibration time were detected with Betaplatescint, after drying the plates at 50 degrees C for 2 h. Measuring the plates without the plastic underdrain increased the counting efficiency by about 39% as compared with counting the plate with the underdrain intact, Presoaking the wells with 0.5% polyethyleneimine for 2 h reduced the nonspecific binding to the filter material by about 50%. A linear relationship of protein concentration and radioligand binding was established up to a protein concentration of 165 mu g of protein/well. In the assays, 70 mu g of protein/well was generally used, which has turned out to be favorable with respect to the number of counts obtained. When a higher concentration of protein was used, the period of time needed to aspirate the plate was too long because of obstruction of the filter material. Receptor-radioligand equilibration was reached after about 20 min at concentrations less than 0.05 nM [M-3]ketanserin-HCl; at higher concentrations it was reached after about 10 min, Saturation analysis of [H-3]ketanserin-HCl resulted in a mean B-max of 393 fmol/mg protein and a K-D of 2.0 nM using rat frontal cortex as a receptor source, Competition experiments with known 5-HT2A receptor ligands-DOB-HCl (K-i = 59 nM), DOET-HCl (K-i = 137 nM), DOM-HCl (K-i = 533 nM), DMT (K-i = 1,985 nM), and TMA-HCl (K-i = 22,340 nM)-were in accordance with literature values.

[H-3]WIN 35,428 binding increased with Na+ concentrations of up to 10-60 mM and decreased at higher concentrations. At pH 7.4, incubation media containing NaCl and/or Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4 were less stimulant than an NaHCO3/NaH2PO4 medium and they shifted maximal binding values to higher ionic concentrations. In an NaHCO3/NaH2PO4-buffered medium, Na+ concentrations >10 mM decreased the binding of 0.2 nM [H-3]WIN 35,428, but an increase of the radioligand concentration shifted this decrease to the right. [H-3]Mazindol binding was stimulated by Nat concentrations 110 mM and was rather unaffected at higher concentrations. The inhibition of [H-3]WIN 35,428 binding produced by 130 mM Naf was independent of the nature of the anion; in contrast, isothionate and H2PO4-/HCO3- produced a more pronounced inhibition of the [H-3]mazindol binding than Cl- and Br-, whereas I- tended to be a stimulant. Ca2+ and Mg2+ more potently inhibited the [H-3]WIN 35,428 binding than K+. All these cations recognize a site which is not mutually exclusive with that of the radioligand since they induced the dissociation of the [H-3]WIN 35,428-rDAT complex, an effect which was reduced (K+) or modified (Ca2+) when the Na+ concentration was increased. This site is likely to be the Na+ site by which low Na+ concentrations allosterically stimulate the uptake blocker binding. However, the intensity of the cation-induced dissociations was moderate and the main component of the binding inhibition that these cations produced results from the occupancy of a cation site, mutually ex-elusive with that of the radioligand. Thus, the WIN 35,428 binding inhibition produced by Ca2+, K+ and Na+ was competitive, and Na+ reduced the inhibitory potency of Ca2+ and K+. This reduction was more intense for Ca2+ and Mg2+ than for K+, suggesting that occupancy of the cation site by a divalent cation activated a strong negative allosteric interaction between this site and the Nai site. Decrease in the Na+ concentration from 10 mM to 5 mM, or replacement of 5 mM HCO3-/H2PO4- by an equimolar concentration of isethionate or Cl- did not modify [H-3]WIN 35,428 binding dissociation. Level(s) at which anions stimulate and inhibit the binding of uptake blockers remain uncertain and could be specific for each radioligand.

BMC CANCER			English	Article						Prostate Cancer; Isolated Local Failure; Radiorecurrent Prostate Cancer; High Dose Rate Brachytherapy; Lutetium-177; Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen; Positron Emission Tomography; Radioligand Therapy		BackgroundIsolated local failure (ILF) can occur in patients who initially receive definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer. Salvage therapy for ILF includes high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can accurately detect ILF and can exclude extraprostatic disease. Lutetium-177 PSMA Radioligand Therapy (RLT) is a novel treatment for prostate cancer that can target prostate cancer accurately, while sparing radiation dose to normal tissues.MethodsROADSTER is a phase I/II randomized, single-institution study. Patients with an ILF of prostate cancer after definitive initial radiation therapy are eligible. The ILF will be confirmed with biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PSMA PET. Patients will be randomized between HDR brachytherapy in two fractions (a standard of care salvage treatment at our institution) (cohort 1) or one treatment of intravenous Lutetium-177 PSMA RLT, followed by one fraction of HDR brachytherapy (cohort 2). The primary endpoints for the phase I portion of the study (n = 12) will be feasibility, defined as 10 or more patients completing the study protocol within 24 months of study activation; and safety, defined as zero or one patients in cohort 2 experiencing grade 3 or higher toxicity in the first 6 months post-treatment. If feasibility and safety are achieved, the study will expand to a phase II study (n = 30 total) where preliminary efficacy data will be evaluated. Secondary endpoints include changes in prostate specific antigen levels, acute toxicity, changes in quality of life, and changes in translational biomarkers. Translational endpoints will include interrogation of blood, urine, and tissue for markers of DNA damage and immune activation with each treatment.DiscussionROADSTER explores a novel salvage therapy for ILF after primary radiotherapy with combined Lutetium-177 PSMA RLT and HDR brachytherapy. The randomized phase I/II design will provide a contemporaneous patient population treated with HDR alone to facilitate assessment of feasibility, tolerability, and biologic effects of this novel therapy.

This effect may be mediated by a direct action on novel corticotropin-releasing factor type 2(CRF2) receptors predicted to be expressed in blood vessels and the heart. Our objectives were to determine the presence of CRF2 receptors in the human cardiovascular system using the selective radioligand [I-125] antisauvagine 30. We also investigated the potential functional roles of novel CRF2 ligands in the regulation of vascular tone in human arteries in vitro. 2 Radioligand binding techniques were used to characterise the CRF2 receptor. [I-125] antisauvagine 30 bound specifically, saturably, reversibly and with high affinity to CRF2 receptors in human left ventricle (K-D 0.21 +/- 0.03 nM, B-MAX 0.80 +/- 0.18 fmol mg(-1) protein), and no change in receptor density or affinity was observed in the dilated cardiomyopathy group. 3 Autoradiographical studies revealed highly localised binding of [I-125] antisauvagine 30 to intramyocardial blood vessels. Binding sites were also detected in the myocardium and in the medial layer of internal mammary arteries. 4 In endothelium-denuded human internal mammary artery in vitro, all peptides tested produced a potent and sustained vasodilator response reversing endothelin-1-induced constrictions ( 10 nM) ( urocortin 1: pD(2) 8.39 +/- 0.32, E-MAX 46 +/- 7.7%; urocortin 2: pD(2) 8.27 +/- 0.17, E-MAX 60 +/- 8.5%; urocortin 3: pD(2) 8.61 +/- 0.25, E-MAX 61 +/- 7.2%; CRF: pD(2) 8.28 +/- 0.27, E-MAX: 40 +/- 10%). 5 We have demonstrated the presence of CRF2 receptors in the human cardiovascular system and a direct, endothelium-independent vasodilator action of urocortins 2and 3, which may counter-balance the centrally mediated pressor effects of CRF and urocortin 1.

[C-11]-5-bromo-2-[2-(dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)]phenylamine ([C-11]DAPA, 10), was synthesized and evaluated in vivo in rats and baboons. [C-11]DAPA (10) was prepared from its monomethylamino precursor 8 by reaction with high specific activity [C-11]methyl iodide. Radiochemical yield was 24 +/- 5% based on [C-11]methyl iodide at end of bombardment (EOB, n = 10) and specific activity was 1553 +/- 939 Ci/mmol at end of synthesis (EOS, n = 10). Binding assays indicated that [C-11]DAPA displays high affinity (Ki 1.49 +/- 0.28 nM for hSERT) and good selectivity for the SERT in vitro. Biodistribution studies in rats indicated that [C-11]DAPA enters into the brain readily and localizes in brain regions known to contain high concentrations of SERT, such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Moreover. such binding in SERT-rich regions of the brain are blocked by pretreatment with either the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram and by the cold compound itself, demonstrating that [C-11]DAPA binding in the rat brain is saturable and specific to SERT. Imaging experiments in baboons indicated that [C-11]DAPA binding is consistent with the known distribution of SERT in the baboon brain, with highest levels of radioactivity detected in the midbrain and thalamus. intermediate levels in the hippocampus and striatum, and lower levels in the cortical regions. Pretreatment of the baboon with citalopram 10 min before radioactivity injection blocked the binding of [C-11]DAPA in all brain regions that contain SERT. Kinetic analysis revealed that, in all brain regions examined, [C-11]DAPA specific to nonspecific distribution volume ratios (V-3") are higher than [C-11](+)-McN 5652 and similar to [C-11]DASB. In summary, [C-11]DAPA appears to be a promising radioligand suitable for the visualization of SERT in vivo using PET. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The binding affinity of the compounds (15-26) with A(2A)R was evaluated using radioligand binding assay on isolated membranes from stably transfected HEK293 cells. Selectivity of the compounds towards A(2A)R was assessed by comparing their binding affinities with A(1) receptors (A(1)R). cAMP concentrations were measured from HEK293 cells treated with compounds (15-26) as compared to NECA (A(2A)R agonist). The compound (16) possessed strongest A(2A)R binding affinity (K-i value = 0.0038 nM) and selectivity (737-fold) versus A(1)R. Decrease in A(2A)R-coupled release of endogenous cAMP from HEK293 cells treated with compounds (15-26) is evocative of their potential as A(2A)R antagonist. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

BRET-based β-arrestin2 recruitment to the histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor for investigating antihistamine binding kinetics	PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Histamine H-1 receptor; Arrestin; Binding rate; Residence time; Bioluminescence resonance energy-transfer; BRET	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; PARTIAL AGONIST; RESIDENCE TIME; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-MECHANISM; NUCLEAR-FACTOR; BETA-ARRESTIN; IN-VIVO	Ligand residence time is thought to be a critical parameter for optimizing the in vivo efficacy of drug candidates. For the histamine H-1 receptor (H1R) and other G protein-coupled receptors, the kinetics of ligand binding are typically measured by low throughput radioligand binding experiments using homogenized cell membranes expressing the target receptor. In this study, a real-time proximity assay between H1R and beta-arresting in living cells was established to investigate the dynamics of antihistamine binding to the H1R. No receptor reserve was found for the histamine-induced recruitment of beta-arresting to the H1R and the transiently recruited beta-arrestin2 therefore reflected occupancy of the receptor by histamine. Antihistamines displayed similar kinetic signatures on antagonizing histamine-induced beta-arrestin-2 recruitment as compared to displacing radioligand binding from the H1R. This homogeneous functional method unambiguously determined the fifty-fold difference in the dissociation rate constant between mepyramine and the long residence time antihistamines levocetirizine and desloratadine.

Reference region approaches in PET: a comparative study on multiple radioligands	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						binding potential; bootstrap errors; brain; PET; quantification; reference region approaches	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO QUANTIFICATION; PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; MODELING CONSIDERATIONS; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; RECEPTOR-BINDING; INPUT FUNCTIONS; PARAMETERS; HUMANS	Reference region (RR) approaches (RRAs) for positron emission tomography (PET) brain studies aim to obtain full quantification without arterial input function (IF) sampling, an invasive and costly procedure. Although they need a reliable RR and are only able to estimate the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), RRAs are widely used. If quantitatively reliable, then RRAs can greatly benefit PET investigations, but their suitability can vary widely from radioligand to radioligand. This study compares estimates of BPND both using IF data and several common RRAs on an extensive data set for each of several radioligands. In addition, two new methods, likelihood estimation in graphical analysis with RR and a bootstrapping algorithm for estimating precision, are presented here for the first time. Although many factors contribute to the performance of each RRA, our results suggest that the kinetics in the RR have a role. In particular, RRAs tend to be good when (1) the RR distribution volume is high; (2) the transfer rate constant from plasma to free compartment in the RR is high; and (3) the transfer rate constant from free to plasma compartment in the RR is low.

We have previously characterised the pharmacological profile of the human dopamine D3 and D2(long) receptors using microphysiometry and radioligand binding and we have now studied the interaction of BP 897 with the dopamine D2 and D3 receptors using these methods. At both human dopamine D3 and D3 receptors. BP 897 lacked agonist activity but was a potent and selective antagonist with pK(b) values of 8.05 +/- 0.16 (4) and 9.43 +/- 0.22 (4) at human dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, respectively. These results, therefore, suggest that it may be the dopamine D3 receptor antagonist properties of BP 897 which have potential in the treatment of addiction and withdrawal.

J	Widjaja, L; Werner, RA; Ross, TL; Bengel, FM; Derlin, T				Widjaja, Liam; Werner, Rudolf A.; Ross, Tobias L.; Bengel, Frank M.; Derlin, Thorsten			PSMA Expression Predicts Early Biochemical Response in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer under <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA-617 Radioligand Therapy	CANCERS			English	Article						prostate carcinoma; PSMA; radioligand therapy; PET; CT; biochemical response; mCRPC	ANTIGEN LEVELS; PET/CT	Simple Summary Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising target for both imaging and radioligand therapies (RLT) for men with prostate cancer. However, not all patients respond to RLT and some even progress early in the treatment course. We aimed to identify parameters to forecast which patients will achieve therapy response prior to commencing RLT. Therefore, we tested whether the tumor volume, the level of PSMA expression or a combination of both in metastases derived from PSMA-targeted molecular imaging prior to RLT can inform the treating physician whether a patient will respond to RLT. Compared to tumor volume, the level of PSMA-expression can better identify patients responding to RLT early in the treatment course. Lu-177-Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-radioligand therapy (RLT) is a promising treatment option in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We aimed to determine the predictive value of pretherapeutic PSMA-ligand positron emission tomography (PET) and established clinical parameters for early biochemical response after two cycles of RLT. In total, 71 mCRPC patients who had undergone PET/computed tomography (CT) with Ga-68-PSMA-11 prior to two cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT were included. Malignant lesions on pretherapeutic PET/CTs were manually segmented and average maximum PSMA expression (maximum standardized uptake values, SUVmax), whole-body PSMA-tumor volume (TV), and whole-body total lesion (TL)-PSMA were calculated. We then tested the predictive performance of these parameters for early biochemical response (defined as prostate-sepcific antigen (PSA) decrease of >= 50% according to PCWG2) after two cycles of RLT, relative to established clinical parameters. Early PSA response was observed in 34/71 patients. PSA change after two cycles of RLT correlated with pretherapeutic SUVmax (r = -0.49; p < 0.001), but not with PSMA-TV (r = 0.02; p = 0.89) or TL-PSMA (r = -0.15; p = 0.22). A cut-off of 19.8 for SUVmax and 75.5 years for age was defined by receiver operating characteristics and revealed a significant outcome difference for early biochemical response between patients with adversely low vs. high PSMA expression and low vs. high age (p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified SUVmax (HR, 7.94, p = 0.001) and age (HR, 8.05, p = 0.002) as independent predictors for PSA response early in the treatment course. Thus, high age and high PSMA expression in patients scheduled for RLT identify patients with early biochemical response. This study provides a rationale for further prospective studies exploring PET-guided treatment intensification in selected patients.

However, the surplus unclicked [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz is cleared somewhat sluggishly through the intestines, which is not ideal for colorectal cancer (CRC) imaging. To shift the excretion of the Tz-radioligand to the renal system, we developed a novel Tz-radioligand by adding a polypeptide linker between HYNIC and PEG(11). Procedures Pretargeted molecular probes [Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz and cetuximab-TCO were synthesized. [Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz was evaluated forin vitrostability andin vivoblood pharmacokinetics.In vitroligation reactivity of [Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz towards cetuximab-TCO was also tested. Biodistribution assay and imaging of [Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz were performed to observe its excretion pathway. Pretargeted biodistribution was measured at three different accumulation intervals to determine the optimal pretargeted interval time. Pretargeted (cetuximab-TCO 48 h/[Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz 6 h) and (cetuximab-TCO 48 h/[Tc-99m]HYNIC-Polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz 6 h) imagings were compared to examine the effect of the excretion pathway on tumor imaging. Results [Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz showed favorablein vitrostability and rapid blood clearance in mice. SEC-HPLC revealed almost complete reaction between cetuximab-TCO and [Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tzin vitro, with the 8:1 Tz-to-mAb reaction providing a conversion yield of 87.83 +/- 3.27 %. Biodistribution and imaging analyses showed that the Tz-radioligand was cleared through the kidneys. After 24, 48, and 72 h of accumulation in HCT116 tumor, the tumor-to-blood ratio of cetuximab-TCO was 0.83 +/- 0.13, 1.40 +/- 0.31, and 1.15 +/- 0.21, respectively. Both pretargeted (cetuximab-TCO 48 h/[Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz 6 h) and (cetuximab-TCO 48 h/[Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz 6 h) clearly delineated HCT116 tumor. Pretargeted imaging strategy using cetuximab-TCO/[Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz could be used for diagnosing CRC, as the surplus unclicked [Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz was cleared through the urinary system, leading to low abdominal uptake background. Conclusion Our novel pretargeted imaging strategy (cetuximab-TCO/[Tc-99m]HYNIC-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz) was useful for imaging CRC, broadening the application scope of pretargeted imaging strategy. The pretargeted imaging strategy clearly delineated HCT116 tumor, showing that its use could be extended to selection of internalizing antibodies.

Herein, we present 2 psychiatric patients who were seropositive for bornavirus and whose treatment-resistant symptoms improved after oral administration of ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral agent. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis indicated that ribavirin affected the central nervous system of these patients. Ribavirin ameliorated intermittent involuntary head shaking, which is reminiscent of a symptom observed in bornavirus-infected animals. Using radioligand assays to examine the serial sera of these patients, we found a relationship between the titers of anti-bornavirus antibodies and the change in the patients' symptoms. Our findings suggest there is a relationship between bornavirus infection and human symptoms and that ribavirin may be useful in suppressing chronic bornavirus infection in some neuropsychiatric patients. However, the possibility remains that some other known or unknown virus other than bornavirus that is sensitive to ribavirin may have caused the symptoms. Additional evidence that directly indicates the causative relationship between bornavirus infection and human symptoms is needed before establishing the pathogenesis and treatment for human bornavirus infection.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the radiation safety of [F-18]Mefway in humans. Six healthy volunteers (three males and three females) were whole-body PET scanned for 114 min after injection of [F-18]Mefway (226 +/- 35 MBq). Estimated radiation doses were determined by the OLINDA/EXM software. [F-18]Mefway was safe and well tolerated by all subjects. Residence time ranges from 0 (gallbladder) to 0.822 h (urinary bladder wall). While the estimated radiation doses in the reproductive and blood-forming organs were below 13.35-22.87 mu Sv/MBq, radiation dose in the urinary bladder wall was 471 mu Sv/MBq. The mean effective dose was 40.23 +/- 6.63 mu Sv/MBq. For a typical single injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi), the dose will result in 87.1 mSv for the urinary bladder wall. To reduce radiation burden, the bladder voiding can be used before [F-18]Mefway PET scan.

Antibody-based molecular imaging improves targeting, and antibody radiolabeling is useful for monitoring biological events in vivo via PET or SPECT. We investigated the potential of molecular imaging to diagnose arthritis with VEGFR-2 in vivo. The I-123-VEGFR-2 antibody was prepared by the iodogen tube method. The radioligand was injected into arthritic mice, and micro SPECT/CT was performed. The arthritic mice were examined by 4.7-T MRI and immunohistochemistry. The I-123-VEGFR-2 antibody showed high uptake in the arthritic region at 1 h postinjection on SPECT/CT but no uptake in the control animals after radioligand injection. In MR images, the arthritic tissue of the mice was correlated with regions labeled by the I-123-VEGFR-2 antibody. Immunohistochemical localization showed markedly increased expression of VEGFR-2 in the endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages of the arthritic mice.

(-)-[I-125]oIV exhibited significant accumulation (about 2.8% of the injected dose) in rat brain. The regional brain distribution of radioactivity was similar for both (-)-[I-125]oIV and (-)-[H-3]vesamicol. The accumulation of (-)-[I-125]oIV in the brain was significant reduced by post-administration of unlabeled vesamicol (0.5 mumol/kg(-1)) and (-)-oIV (0.5 mumol/kg(-1)). On the other hand, the post-administration of sigma ligands hardly affected the accumulation of (-)-[I-125]oIV in the brain. These studies showed that (-)-[I-125]oIV, as well as [H-3]vesamicol, bound to VAChT with high affinity in the rat brain. Furthermore, (-)-[I-125]oIV binding in the ipsilateral cortex to the lesion was significantly reduced by 17.0%, compared with that in the contralateral cortex in a unilateral NBM-lesioned rat. These results suggested that radioiodinated (-)-oIV may potentially be useful for the diagnosis of cholinergic neurodegenerative disorders.
