Preclinical evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]NE40, a type 2 cannabinoid receptor PET tracer	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						[C-11]NE40; Type 2 cannabinoid receptor; PET; Neuroinflammation	ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE; CB2 RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; RAT-BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; EXPRESSION; LIGANDS	Introduction: Up-regulation of the type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) has been reported in (neuro)inflammatory diseases. In this study, we report the preclinical evaluation of [C-11]NE40 as positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for visualization of the CB2R. Methods: The selectivity of NE40 for CB2R and its toxicity and mutagenicity were determined. [C-11]NE40 was evaluated by biodistribution and autoradiography studies in normal rats and a microPET study in normal mice, rats and a rhesus monkey. Specific in vivo binding of [C-11]NE40 to human CB2R (hCB(2)R) was studied in a rat model with hCB(2)R overexpression. Results: [C-11]NE40 shows specific CB2R binding in the spleen and blood of normal rats and high brain uptake in rhesus monkey. [C-11]NE40 showed specific and reversible binding to hCB(2)R in vivo in a rat model with local hCB(2)R overexpression. Conclusions: [C-11]NE40 shows favorable characteristics as radioligand for in vivo visualization of the CB2R and is a promising candidate for hCB(2)R PET imaging. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Chemical mediators released in response to acute stress include the catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine. Mammalian lymphocytes and macrophages express beta-adrenergic receptors (AR) that can bind catecholamines, leading to changes in cell function. In this study, radioligand binding assays demonstrated the presence of beta-AR in membranes isolated from head kidney and spleen leukocytes of the channel catfish, Ictalurus punctatas. Competition with subtype selective antagonists CGP-20,712 (beta(1)) and ICI-118,551 (beta(2)) suggested that the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor is the primary receptor subtype present on these membranes. These data along with the HPLC-quantification of catecholamines in plasma of L punctatus lend further support to the contention that crosstalk between the neuroendocrine and immune systems in lower vertebrates is mediated in part by stress-related biogenic amines like epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Identification and Preclinical Development of a 2,5,6-Trisubstituted Fluorinated Pyridine Derivative as a Radioligand for the Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Cannabinoid Type 2 Receptors	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO EVALUATION; PET RADIOLIGANDS; CB2 RECEPTORS; HIGH-AFFINITY; SYSTEM; LIPOPHILICITY; PHARMACOLOGY; EXPRESSION; DISCOVERY; BINDING	Despite the broad implications of the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) in neuroinflammatory processes, a suitable CB2-targeted probe is currently lacking in clinical routine. In this work, we synthesized 15 fluorinated pyridine derivatives and tested their binding affinities toward CB2 and CB1. With a subnanomolar affinity (K-i for CB2) of 0.8 nM and a remarkable selectivity factor of >12,000 over CB1, RoSMA-18-d(6) exhibited outstanding in vitro performance characteristics and was radio-fluorinated with an average radiochemical yield of 10.6 +/- 3.8% (n = 16) and molar activities ranging from 52 to 65 GBq/mu mol (radiochemical purity > 99%). [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) showed exceptional CB2 attributes as demonstrated by in vitro autoradiography, ex vivo biodistribution, and positron emission tomography (PET). Further, [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) was used to detect CB2 upregulation on postmortem human ALS spinal cord tissues. Overall, these results suggest that [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) is a promising CB2 PET radioligand for clinical translation.

Of these compounds, N-(3-chloro-4-(4-fluoro-1,3-dioxoisoindolin-2-yl)phenyl)-2-picolinamide (3, KALB001) exhibited improved binding affinity (IC50 = 5.1 nM) compared with ML128 (1) and was subsequently labeled with F-18. When finally formulated in 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4) with 10% ethanol, the specific activity of [F-18]3 at the end of synthesis (EOS) was 233.5 +/- 177.8 GBq/mu mol (n = 4). The radiochemical yield of [F-18]3 was 16.4 +/- 4.8% (n = 4), and the purity was over 98%. In vivo imaging studies in a monkey showed that the radiotracer quickly penetrated the brain with the highest accumulation in the brain areas known to express mGlu4. Despite some unfavorable radiotracer properties like fast washout in rodent studies, [F-18]3 is the first F-18-labeled mGlu4 radioligand, which can be further modified to improve pharmacokinetics and brain penetrability for future human studies.

Radioligand Binding Assays: Application of [<SUP>125</SUP>I]Angiotensin II Receptor Binding	G PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS IN DRUG DISCOVERY	Methods in Molecular Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Angiotensin receptor; Losartan; Radioligand; Saralasin; Liver; Specific binding		Angiotensin II (AngII) is an octapeptide hormone with a key role in blood pressure regulation. AngII increases blood pressure by stimulating G protein-coupled receptors in vascular smooth muscle. AngII receptors are therefore an important target in patients with high blood pressure. Strategies to lower high blood pressure (hypertension) include the use of drugs that compete for AngII at the angiotensin II Type I receptors (ATR) using ATR antagonists (e.g., irbesartan, valsartan, and losartan). This chapter will demonstrate the subtype specificity of ATR binding and we discuss some of the key experiments that are necessary in optimizing some of the parameters for GPCR screening. The latter protocols include saturation binding to determine K-d and B-max, as well as competition/inhibition experiments to determine the IC50 of binding. For these experiments we have used rat liver membranes which express ATR (type 1a) in relatively abundant amounts. Additionally, rat liver membrane preparations can be easily prepared in "bulk," frozen away for extended periods (LIP to 1 year) and used when necessary with no loss of receptor binding activity using the radiolabeled angiotensin II analogue, [I-125] [Sar(1), I le(8)]jAngII.

In order to identify an effective PET radioligand for in vivo assessment of the alpha4beta2 subtype of nicotinic receptor, we synthesized [F-18]3-[1-(3-fluoropropyl)-(S)-pyrrolidin-2-ylmethoxy]pyridine (NicFP). The in vitro K-D of NicFP was determined to be 1.1 nM, and the log P value obtained by HPLC analysis of the unlabelled standard was found to be 2.2. The radiosynthesis of [F-18]NicFP was carried out by a nucleophilic substitution reaction of anhydrous [F-18]fluoride and the corresponding mesylate precursor. After purification by HPLC, the radiochemical yield was determined to be 11.3 +/- 2.1% and the specific activity was 0.47 +/- 0.18 Ci/mumol (EOS, n = 3). The time of synthesis and purification was 99 +/- 2 min. The final product was prepared as a sterile saline solution suitable for in vivo use. Copyright C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

[C-11]mG4P012 was shown to be a promising PET radioligand for mGluR4 in the monkey brain and for further development in human subjects. However, the previously reported multi-step synthesis of the thiophenol precursor suffered from low yields and difficult workup procedures. To support the translational research of [C-11] mG4P012 and the other potential applications, we have developed a new route for synthesis of the thiophenol precursor and optimized the reaction conditions. The synthesis of N-(4-chloro-3-mercaptophenyl)picolinamide from 1-chloro-4-nitrobenzene has been greatly improved from 8% to 52% total yield with easy handling and in gram scales.

Optimization of a Pretargeted Strategy for the PET Imaging of Colorectal Carcinoma via the Modulation of Radioligand Pharmacokinetics	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						Positron Emission Tomography; PET; Pretargeting; huA33; Colorectal Cancer; Click Chemistry; Inverse Electron Demand Diels-Alder Reaction; Tetrazine; Transcyclooctene	IN-VIVO EVALUATION; INTEGRIN ALPHA(V)BETA(6)-SPECIFIC PEPTIDE; TRANS-CYCLOOCTENE LIGATION; PROMOTED CLICK CHEMISTRY; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY A33; BIOORTHOGONAL CHEMISTRY; BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY; TUMOR UPTAKE; RGD PEPTIDE; IMMUNO-PET	Pretargeted PET imaging has emerged as an effective strategy for merging the exquisite selectivity of antibody-based targeting vectors with the rapid pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled small molecules. We previously reported the development of a strategy for the pretargeted PET imaging of colorectal cancer based on the bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction between a tetrazine-bearing radioligand and a transcyclooctene-modified huA33 immunoconjugate. Although this method effectively delineated tumor tissue, its clinical potential was limited by the somewhat sluggish clearance of the radioligand through the gastrointestinal tract. Herein, we report the development and in vivo validation of a pretargeted strategy for the PET imaging of colorectal carcinoma with dramatically improved pharmacokinetics. Two novel tetrazine constructs, Tz-PEG(7)-NOTA and Tz-SarAr, were synthesized, characterized, and radiolabeled with Cu-64 in high yield (>90%) and radiochemical purity (>99%). PET imaging and biodistribution experiments in healthy mice revealed that although "Cu-Tz-PEG(7)-NOTA is cleared via both the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, Cu-64-Tz-SarAr is rapidly excreted by the renal system alone. On this basis, Cu-64-Tz-SarAr was selected for further in vivo evaluation. To this end, mice bearing A33 antigen-expressing SW1222 human colorectal carcinoma xenografts were administered huA33-TCO, and the immunoconjugate was given 24 h to accumulate at the tumor and clear from the blood, after which Cu-64-Tz-SarAr was administered via intravenous tail vein injection. PET imaging and biodistribution experiments revealed specific uptake of the radiotracer in the tumor at early time points (5.6 +/- 0.7 %ID/g at 1 h p.i.), high tumor-to-background activity ratios, and rapid elimination of unclicked radioligand. Importantly, experiments with longer antibody accumulation intervals (48 and 120 h) yielded slight decreases in tumoral uptake but also concomitant increases in tumor-to-blood activity concentration ratios. This new strategy offers dosimetric benefits as well, yielding a total effective dose of 0.041 rem/mCi, far below the doses produced by directly labeled Cu-64-NOTA-huA33 (0.133 rem/mCi) and Zr-89-DFO-huA33 (1.54 rem/mCi). Ultimately, this pretargeted PET imaging strategy boasts a dramatically improved pharmacokinetic profile compared to our first generation system and is capable of clearly delineating tumor tissue with high image contrast at only a fraction of the radiation dose created by directly labeled radioimmunoconjugates.

A<sub>2A</sub> and A<sub>2B</sub> adenosine receptors: The extracellular loop 2 determines high (A<sub>2A</sub>) or low affinity (A<sub>2B</sub>) for adenosine	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adenosine; cAMP; Extracellular loop; GPCR; Chimeric receptor; Radioligand binding	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SUMD; LIGAND RECOGNITION; SUBTYPE-SELECTIVITY; BINDING; DEAMINASE; MEMBRANES; RESIDUES; PATHWAY; A(1)	A(2A) and A(2B) adenosine receptors (ARs) are closely related G protein-coupled receptor subtypes, which represent important (potential) drug targets. Despite their almost identical binding sites for adenosine, A(2A)ARs are activated by low (nanomolar) adenosine concentrations, while A(2B)ARs require micromolar concentrations. In the present study, we exchanged the extracellular loop 2 (ECL2) of the human A(2A)AR for that of the A(2B)AR. The resulting chimeric A(2A)(ECL2-A(2B))AR was investigated in radioligand binding and cAMP accumulation assays in comparison to the wildtype A(2A)AR. While the ribose-modified adenosine analog N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and its 2-substituted derivative CGS-21680 did not exhibit significant changes, adenosine showed dramatically reduced potency and affinity for the A(2A)(ECL2-A(2B))AR mutant displaying similarly low potency as for the wt A(2B)AR. Supervised molecular dynamics simulation studies predicted a meta-binding site with high affinity for adenosine, but not for NECA, which may contribute to the observed effects.

The beta(1)-selective (CGP 20712A) and beta(2)-selective (ICI 118.551) antagonists as well as the nonselective beta-agonists isoproterenol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were used in displacement studies. In all cardiac chambers, ICI 118.551 and CGP 20712A displacement curves were monophasic and steep, with the affinity of CGP 20712A higher than that of ICI 118.551, indicating the exclusive presence of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor subtype. The agonist rank order of potency was isoproterenol > norepinephrine >= epinephrine, typical for the beta(1)-receptor subtype. In all chambers, the density of beta-adrenergic receptors was similar to 40 fmol/mg protein and the K-D was similar to 30 pM. The study revealed similar beta-adrenergic receptor density mainly of the beta(1)-subtype in all cardiac chambers, indicating that this receptor subtype could contribute equally to regulate cardiac physiological function and pathophysiology.

We designed a biotinylated radioligand intended for use in the detection of avidin-modified polymer nanoparticles in tissue with positron emission tomography (PET). Using an F-18 labeled prosthetic group, [F-18](4)-fluorobenzylamine, and a commercially available biotin derivate, NHS-PEG4-biotin, [F-18]-fluorobenzylamide-poly(ethylene glycol)4-biotin ([F-18]NPB4) was prepared with high purity and specific activity. The attachment of the [F-18]NPB4 radioligand to avidin-modified poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles was tested by using PET imaging to measure the kinetics of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of nanoparticles of varying size to the rat brain. PET imaging enabled the direct observation of nanoparticle delivery by measurement of the spatial volume of distribution of radiolabeled nanoparticles as a function of time, both during and after the infusion. This work thus validates new methods for radiolabeling PEG-biotin derivatives and also provides insight into the fate of nanoparticles that have been infused directly into the brain.

Competition radioligand binding assays for the investigation of bispyridinium compound affinities to the human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtype 5 (hM5)	DRUG TESTING AND ANALYSIS			English	Article						muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; human M5 receptor; bispyridinium compound; radioligand binding assay; [3H] N-methylscopolamine	ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; LIGAND-BINDING; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; ION CHANNEL; AGONISTS; EXPRESSION; MECHANISM; SAD-128; METHYLSCOPOLAMINE; COOPERATIVITY	Standard treatment of poisoning by organophosphorus (OP) nerve agents with atropine and oximes lacks efficacy with some nerve agents. Promising in vitro and in vivo results were obtained with the bispyridinium compound SAD-128 which was partly attributed to its interaction with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Previous studies indicate that bispyridinium compounds interact with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors as well. The muscarinic M5 receptor is not well investigated compared to other subtypes, but could be important in the search for new drugs for treating nerve agent poisoning. A set of bispyridinium compounds structurally related to SAD-128 were tested in competition binding experiments with recombinant human M5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Five of the six investigated bispyridinium compounds interacted with the orthosteric binding site, with affinities in the low micromolar range. These data indicate that interaction of bispyridinium compounds with muscarinic receptors may contribute to their therapeutic efficacy. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.	[Niessen, K.

For the automated regular production of [18F]SPA-RQ for clinical use in the USA under an IND we chose to use a modified commercial synthesis module (TRACERlab FXF-N; GE Medical Systems) with an auxiliary custom-made robotic cooling-heating reactor, after evaluating several alternative radiosynthesis conditions. The automated radiosynthesis and its quality control are described here. [F-18]SPA-RQ was regularly obtained within 150 min from the start of radiosynthesis in high radiochemical purity (> 99%) and chemical purity and with an overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 15 +/- 2% (mean +/- S.D.; n = 10) from cyclotron-produced [F-18]fluoride ion. The specific radioactivity of [F-18]SPA-RQ at the end of synthesis ranged from 644 to 2140 mCi/mu mol (23.8-79.2 GBq/mu mol). Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Dual-tracer ex vivo autoradiographic analysis using (-)-[I-125]mIV and [Tc-99m]HMPAO was conducted to the effect of regional cerebral perfusion on the brain distribution of (-)-[I-125]mIV in a unilateral NBM-lesioned rat. (-)-[I-125]mIV binding in the ipsilateral cortex to the lesion significantly reduced by 10.4 %, compared with that in the contralateral cortex, while (-)-[I-125]mIV binding in the ipsilateral caudate putamen, hippocampus and thalamus did not change. The rate of reduction in the (-)-[I-125]mIV binding (10.4 %) was significantly higher than that of [Tc-99m]HMPAO accumulation (4.0%) in the ipsilateral cortex to the lesion (P < 0.01). These results suggested that radioiodinated (-)-mIV may be useful in the study of dementia characterized by degeneration of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system, such as Alzheimer's disease.

Comparison of PET/CT-based eligibility according to VISION and TheraP trial criteria in end-stage prostate cancer patients undergoing radioligand therapy	ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PSMA radioligand therapy; PET-based eligibility; Dual tracer imaging; VISION; TheraP		Background: Two randomized clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy (PSMA RLT) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). While the VISION trial used criteria within PSMA PET/CT for inclusion, the TheraP trial used dual tracer imaging including FDG PET/CT. Therefore, we investigated whether the application of the VISION criteria leads to a benefit in overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) for men with mCRPC after PSMA RLT.Methods: Thirty-five men with mCRPC who had received PSMA RLT as a last-line option and who had undergone pretherapeutic imaging with FDG and [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA I&T or [F-18]PSMA-1007 were studied. Therapeutic eligibility was retrospectively evaluated using the VISION and TheraP study criteria.Results: 26 of 35 (74%) treated patients fulfilled the VISION criteria (= VISION+) and only 17 of 35 (49%) fulfilled the TheraP criteria (= TheraP+). Significantly reduced OS and PFS after PSMA RLT was observed in patients rated VISION- compared to VISION+ (OS: VISION-: 3 vs. VISION+: 12 months, hazard ratio (HR) 3.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.0-9.1, p < 0.01; PFS: VISION-: 1 vs. VISION+: 5 months, HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.0-7.8, p < 0.01). For patients rated TheraP-, no significant difference in OS but in PFS was observed compared to TheraP+ patients (OS: TheraP-: 5.5 vs. TheraP+: 11 months, HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.8-3.3, p = 0.2; PFS: TheraP-: 1 vs. TheraP+: 6 months, HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0-4.5, p < 0.01).Conclusion: Retrospective application of the inclusion criteria of the VISION study leads to a benefit in OS and PFS after PSMA RL, whereas TheraP criteria appear to be too strict in patients with end-stage prostate cancer. Thus, performing PSMA PET/CT including a contrast-enhanced CT as proposed in the VISION trial might be sufficient for treatment eligibility of end-stage prostate cancer patients.

Initiated by the German Society of Nuclear Medicine, a retrospective multicenter data analysis was started in 2015 to evaluate efficacy and safety of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in a large cohort of patients. Methods: One hundred forty-five patients (median age, 73 y; range, 43-88 y) with mCRPC were treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 in 12 therapy centers between February 2014 and July 2015 with 1-4 therapy cycles and an activity range of 2-8 GBq per cycle. Toxicity was categorized by the common toxicity criteria for adverse events (version 4.0) on the basis of serial blood tests and the attending physician's report. The primary endpoint for efficacy was biochemical response as defined by a prostate-specific antigen decline >= 50% from baseline to at least 2 wk after the start of RLT. Results: A total of 248 therapy cycles were performed in 145 patients. Data for biochemical response in 99 patients as well as data for physician-reported and laboratory-based toxicity in 145 and 121 patients, respectively, were available. The median follow-up was 16 wk (range, 2-30 wk). Nineteen patients died during the observation period. Grade 3-4 hematotoxicity occurred in 18 patients: 10%, 4%, and 3% of the patients experienced anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, respectively. Xerostomia occurred in 8%. The overall biochemical response rate was 45% after all therapy cycles, whereas 40% of patients already responded after a single cycle. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and the presence of visceral metastases were negative predictors and the total number of therapy cycles positive predictors of biochemical response. Conclusion: The present retrospective multicenter study of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT demonstrates favorable safety and high efficacy exceeding those of other third-line systemic therapies in mCRPC patients. Future phase II/III studies are warranted to elucidate the survival benefit of this new therapy in patients with mCRPC.

This study sought to assess the ability of [F-18]SF51 to quantify TSPO in rhesus monkey brain. Methods Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging was performed in monkey brain (n = 3) at baseline and after pre-blockade with the TSPO ligands PK11195 and PBR28. TSPO binding was calculated as total distribution volume corrected for free parent fraction in plasma (V-T/f(P)) using a two-tissue compartment model. Receptor occupancy and nondisplaceable uptake were determined via Lassen plot. Binding potential (BPND) was calculated as the ratio of specific binding to nondisplaceable uptake. Time stability of V-T was used as an indirect probe to detect radiometabolite accumulation in the brain. In vivo and ex vivo experiments were performed in mice to determine the distribution of the radioligand. Results After [F-18]SF51 injection, the concentration of brain radioactivity peaked at 2.0 standardized uptake value (SUV) at similar to 10 min and declined to 30% of the peak at 180 min. V-T/f(P) at baseline was generally high (203 +/- 15 mL center dot cm(-3)) and decreased by similar to 90% after blockade with PK11195. BPND of the whole brain was 7.6 +/- 4.3. V-T values reached levels similar to terminal 180-min values by 100 min and remained relatively stable thereafter with excellent identifiability (standard errors < 5%), suggesting that no significant radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Ex vivo experiments in mouse brain showed that 96% of radioactivity was parent. No significant uptake was observed in the skull, suggesting a lack of defluorination in vivo. ConclusionThe results demonstrate that [F-18]SF51 is an excellent radioligand that can quantify TSPO with a good ratio of specific to nondisplaceable uptake and has minimal radiometabolite accumulation in brain. Collectively, the results suggest that [F-18]SF51 warrants further evaluation in humans.

Salivary Gland Toxicity of PSMA-Targeted Radioligand Therapy with <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA and Combined <SUP>225</SUP>Ac- and <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-Labeled PSMA Ligands (TANDEM-PRLT) in Advanced Prostate Cancer: A Single-Center Systematic Investigation	DIAGNOSTICS			English	Article						PSMA; radioligand therapy; mCRPC; salivary gland toxicity; xerostomia	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; RADIOACTIVE IODINE; NECK-CANCER; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PAROTID-GLAND; HEAD; RADIOTHERAPY; XEROSTOMIA; VOLUME; TUMOR	Purpose: PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy (PRLT) is a promising treatment option for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, a high uptake of the radiopharmaceutical in the salivary glands (SG) can lead to xerostomia and becomes dose-limiting for Ac-225-PSMA-617. This study investigated the sialotoxicity of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T/-617 monotherapy and co-administered Ac-225-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA-617 (Tandem-PPRLT). Methods: Three patient cohorts, that had undergone Lu-177-PSMA-I&T/-617 monotherapy or Tandem-PRLT, were retrospectively analyzed. In a short-term cohort (91 patients), a xerostomia assessment (CTCAE v.5.0), a standardized questionnaire (sXI), salivary gland scintigraphy (SGS), and SG SUVmax and the metabolic volume (MV) on Ga-68-PSMA-11-PET/CT were obtained before and after two cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T/-617. In a long-term cohort, 40 patients were similarly examined. In a Tandem cohort, the same protocol was applied to 18 patients after one cycle of Tandem-PRLT. Results: Grade 1 xerostomia in the short-term follow-up was observed in 22 (24.2%) patients with a worsening of sXI from 7 to 8 at (p < 0.05). In the long-term cohort, xerostomia grades 1 to 2 occurred in 16 (40%) patients. SGS showed no significant changes, but there was a decline of the MV of all SGs. After Tandem-PRLT, 12/18 (66.7%) patients reported xerostomia grades 1 to 2, and the sXI significantly worsened from 9.5 to 14.0 (p = 0.005), with a significant reduction in the excretion fraction (EF) and MV of all SGs. Conclusion: Lu-177-PSMA-I&T/-617 causes only minor SG toxicity, while one cycle of Tandem-PRLT results in a significant SG impairment. This standardized protocol may help to objectify and quantify SG dysfunction.

We investigated how such reductions related to analytical confounds and disease progression markers in atypical AD. Methods We assessed regional and interindividual variation in longitudinal change on F-18-flortaucipir PET imaging in 24 amyloid beta (A beta)+ patients with atypical, early-onset amnestic or non-amnestic AD plus 62 A beta- and 132 A beta+ Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants. Results In atypical AD, F-18-flortaucipir uptake slowed or declined over time in areas with high baseline signal and older, more impaired individuals. ADNI participants had reduced longitudinal change in early Braak stage regions relative to late-stage areas. Discussion Results suggested radioligand uptake plateaus or declines in advanced neurodegeneration. Further research should investigate whether results generalize to other radioligands and whether they relate to changes of the radioligand binding site structure or accessibility.

The carboxyl group of these compounds is charged at physiological pH and therefore penetration of the compounds into the brain is low. In the present study we have transformed the carboxyl group of diflunisal and meclofenamate into non-ionizable functional groups and analyzed the effects of the modifications on stimulation of [H-3]muscimol binding and on potentiation of gamma-aminobutyric acid-induced displacement of 4'-ethenyl-4-n-[2,3-H-3]propylbicycloorthobenzoate. N-Butylamide derivative of diflunisal modulated radioligand binding with equal or higher potency than the parent compound, while diflunisalamide showed reduced allosteric effect as compared to diflunisal. Amide derivative of meclofenamate equally affected radioligand binding parameters, while both diflunisal and meclofenamate methyl esters were less active than the parent compounds. Our study clearly demonstrates that an intact carboxyl group in diflunisal and meclofenamate is not indispensable for their positive GABA(A)R modulation. Further derivatization of the compound might yield compounds with higher selectivity for GABA(A)Rs that could be utilized in drug development.

Since the guinea pig is extensively used as an animal model for asthma, we investigated the occurrence of possible polymorphism of the guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor. The guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor coding region was amplified by sequence homology-based cloning. Homology of the translated protein with the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor was 88% with Ala at position 16 and Glu at position 27. Radioligand binding and cAMP-accumulation experiments of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor revealed a homogeneous population of functional receptors. Five degenerate single nucleotide polymorphisms were found within the beta(2)-adrenoceptor coding region of outbred Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs, at residues 354, 453, 483, 534 and 642. In conclusion, we have cloned the guinea pig beta(2)-adrenoceptor, which shows to be functional upon expression in a recombinant system and contains five single nucleotide polymorphisms dissimilar to human polymorphisms.

In PET studies, 6-[F-18]FA specifically labeled central nAChRs in the brain of the Rhesus monkey and demonstrated highest levels of accumulation of radioactivity in brain regions enriched with the a,Pz subtype of nAChR, 6-[F-18]FA exhibited a target-to-non-target ratio (estimated as radioactivity in the thalamus to that in the cerebellum) of binding in primate brain similar to that previously determined for a labeled analog of epibatidine, [F-18]FPH. In contrast to [F-18]FPH, the novel tracer is expected to exhibit substantially less toxicity. Thus, the novel radioligand, 6-[18F]FA, appears to be a suitable candidate for imaging nAChRs in human brain. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

Thus, antagonists of this receptor have been pursued as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of obesity. A novel series of potent and selective phenylamide or biaryl urea NPY Y-5 receptor antagonists was identified. Four representative compounds from this series, SCH 208639 (N-[4-[(1,1-dimethylbutyl)thio]phenyl]-2,2-dimethylpropanamide), SCH 430765 (N-[[[3'-fluoro[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl]amino] carbonyl]-N-methyl-1-(methylsulfonyl)-4-piperidinamine), SCH 488106 (N-[[[3',5'-difluoro[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl]amino]carbonyl]-N-methyl-1-[(5-methyl-3-pyridinyl)carbonyl]-4-piperidinamine) and SCH 500946 (N-[[[5-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-2-pyrazinyl]amino]carbonyl]-N-methyl-1-(methylsulfonyl)-4-piperidinamine), behaved as competitive antagonists in radioligand binding assays, but displayed apparently insurmountable antagonism in a cell-based functional assay. The apparently insurmountable antagonism was due to slow receptor dissociation rates rather than covalent binding, because the antagonists' effects could be reduced by extensive washing of cells after antagonist exposure. A novel radioligand, [S-35]SCH 500946, was also developed and used to characterize the interaction of these antagonists with the NPY Y-5 receptor. [S-35]SCH 500946 had high affinity for the NPY Y-5 receptor (K-d=0.29 nM), and the binding kinetics (k(on) 4.414 x 10(7) M-1 min(-1); k(off) 0.009816 min(-1)) confirmed that the compound slowly dissociates from the receptor. In a competition binding assay, NPY failed to displace [S-35]SCH 500946 completely, indicating that the binding sites for NPY and [S-35]SCH 500946 are not identical. These data indicate that the apparent insurmountable antagonism of these NPY Y-5 receptor antagonists is attributable both to slow receptor dissociation rates and to binding at a site distinct from NPY.

Saturation experiments showed that [H-3]ZM241385 binds to a single class of binding sites with high affinity (K-d = 0.23 nM and 0.14 nM in CHO cell and striatal membranes, respectively). The membranes of CHO cells required pretreatment with adenosine deaminase (ADA) to achieve high-affinity binding, while ADA had no influence on the ligand binding properties in striatal membranes. The binding of [H-3]ZM241385 was fast and reversible, achieving equilibrium within 20 minutes at all radioligand concentrations. The kinetic analysis of the [H-3]ZM241385 interaction with A(2A) receptors indicated that the reaction had at least two subsequent steps. The first step corresponds to a fast equilibrium, which also determines the antagonist potency to competitively inhibit CGS21680-induced accumulation of cAMP (first equilibrium constant K-A 6.6 nM). The second step corresponds to a slow process of conformational isomerization (equilibrium constant K-i 0.03). The combination of the two steps gives the dissociation constant K-d = 0.20 nM based on the kinetic data, which is in good agreement with the directly measured value. The data obtained shed light on the mechanism of the [H-3]ZM241385 interaction with adenosine A(2A) receptors from different sources in vitro. The isomerization step of the A(2A) antagonist radioligand binding has to be taken into account for the interpretation of the binding parameters obtained from the various competition assays and explain the discrepancy between antagonist affinity in saturation experiments versus its potency in functional assays.

Thus, we aim to investigate the feasibility of using specific P2X7-targeted F-18-labeled tracer F-18-FTTM ((2-chloro-3-[F-18]fluorophenyl)[1,4,6,7-tetrahydro-1-(2-pyrimidinyl)-5H-1,2,3-triazolo[4,5-c]pyridin-5-yl]methanone) for PET study of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques identification. Method The radioligand F-18-FTTM was achieved based on the copper-mediated radiofluorination of arylstannane. In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to verify the biochemical properties. Dynamic F-18-FTTM Micro-PET/CT imaging was performed for 1 h on ApoE(-/-) mice (10, 20, 30 weeks on high-fat diet) and wild-type C57BL/6 J mice on normal diet. Ex vivo PET imaging was conducted to verify the specificity of the radioligand. Serum inflammatory cytokines, lipids, and lipoproteins profiles were detected by ELISA. The lipid distribution and morphology of plaques were evaluated by Oil Red O, HE, Masson, and immunofluorescence stainings. Results F-18-FTTM was afforded with decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 5-10%, specific activity of 269-320 MBq/nmol (n = 8, EOS), and radiochemical purity of above 99%. F-18-FTTM showed excellent stability in vitro, rapid blood clearance in mice, good affinity to RAW264.7 cells. We observed an increase in both in vivo and ex vivo imagings as disease progressed, and the imaging signatures correlated with histopathological features. Furthermore, compared with F-18-FDG imaging, the SUVmax values of F-18-FTTM at the aortic arch of ApoE(-/-) mice of high-fat feeding for 20 and 30 weeks were 43% and 53% higher than those of the control group, respectively. Conclusion We innovatively apply a new type P2X7-targeted PET probe (F-18-FTTM) to identify vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques, to detect the inflammatory response of atherosclerosis, and to provide a powerful non-invasive method for the diagnosis of atherosclerotic lesions and new drug screening for accurate treatment.

We have pursued quantification of the P2Y(1) receptor through the development of a series of selective P2Y(1) receptor antagonists. 2 Recently, we synthesized 2-iodo-N-6-methyl-(N)- methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2500), a selective, competitive antagonist that exhibits a K-i of 0.8 nM in competition-binding assays with [H-3] MRS2279. A 3'- monophosphate precursor molecule, MRS2608, was radiolabeled at the 5' position with P-32 using polynucleotide kinase and [gamma P-32] ATP to yield [P-32] MRS2500. 3 [P-32] MRS2500 bound selectively to Sf9 insect cell membranes expressing the human P2Y(1) receptor (Sf9-P2Y(1)), but did not detectably bind membranes expressing other P2Y receptors. P2Y(1) receptor binding to [P-32] MRS2500 was saturable with a K-D of 1.2 nM. Agonists and antagonists of the P2Y(1) receptor inhibited [P-32] MRS2500 binding in Sf9-P2Y(1) membranes with values in agreement with those observed in functional assays of the P2Y(1) receptor. 4 A high-affinity binding site for [P-32] MRS2500 (K-D 0.33 nM) was identified in rat brain, which exhibited the pharmacological selectivity of the P2Y(1) receptor. Distribution of this binding site varied among rat tissues, with the highest amount of binding appearing in lung, liver, and brain. Among brain regions, distribution of the [P-32] MRS2500 binding site varied by six-fold, with the highest and lowest amounts of sites detected in cerebellum and cortex, respectively. 5 Taken together, these data illustrate the synthesis and characterization of a novel P2Y(1) receptor radioligand and its utility for examining P2Y(1) receptor expression in native mammalian tissues.

An analysis of the involvement of monoaminergic mechanisms in the neuropsychotropic effects of neuroglutam	NEUROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						neuroglutam; derivatives of glutamic acid; dopamine; dopaminergic neurotransmission; dopamine receptors; radioligand binding in vitro and ex vivo	LOCOMOTOR BEHAVIOR; AMPHETAMINE; RECEPTORS; GLUTARONE; RGPU-135	It is known that neuroglutam (at 26 mg/kg) potentiates stereotypy that is induced by the agonist of postsynaptic dopamine receptors apomorphine (1 mg/kg), and suppresses catalepsy that is induced by the blocker of postsynaptic dopamine receptors haloperidol (1 mg/kg), which points to its stimulatory influence on dopaminergic neurotransmission. Neuroglutam (26 mg/kg) does not affect the contents of noradrenaline and dopamine (DA) in homogenates of rat brain structures; however, it increases the concentration of the metabolites of dopamine 3,4-dioxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the frontal cortex and homovanillic acid (HVA) in the hippocampus, which points to its positive influence on the rate of DA utilization, and, in addition, an increase in indices that characterize the rate of DA turnover, viz., DOPAC/DA and HVA/DA in the striatum. We used the method of radioligand binding in vitro with [G-H-3]-sulpiride to show that neuroglutam (10(-10)-10(-4) M) does not directly interact with dopamine D-2 receptors; however, during subchronic administration (5 days; a single daily dose of 26 mg/kg) neuroglutam promotes an increase in the density of D2 receptors in the prefrontal cortex, which points to its ability to modulate the expression of these receptors. The data from neurochemical and radioligand analysis suggest that both presynaptic (intensification of metabolic DA turnover) and postsynaptic (DA receptors) mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission are involved in the neuropsychotropic action of neuroglutam. Neuroglutam did not influence the strength of hyperkinesia that was induced by the metabolic precursor of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptophan on the content of serotonin and its metabolites in rat-brain structures and did not alter the receptor binding of [G-H-3]-ketanserin (an antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors) in the prefrontal cortex both under in vitro conditions and during subchronic administration ex vivo, which points to the absence of direct participation of the serotonergic system in the pharmacological action of the studied drug.

Methods: Radioligand binding assays were performed to characterize the binding kinetics between [I-125]-labeled ITF and IEC-6, HT-29, Caco2 and HaCaT cells. The K-d, B-max and other kinetic variables describing the interaction between ITF and its potential receptors were determined. Results: Radioligand binding assays performed at 4 degrees C showed that the K-d value for the association between [I-125]-ITF and IEC-6, HT-29, and Caco2 cells were 1.99 +/- 0.12x10(-9) M, 3.89 +/- 0.42x10(-9) M, and 2.04 +/- 0.17x10(-9) M, respectively. B-max values were 1.17 +/- 0.04x10(11), 3.97 +/- 0.29x10(11), and 2.03 +/- 0.08x10(11) sites/cell, respectively. The K-i values for the interaction between IEC-6, HT-29, and Caco2 cells and non-labeled ITF were 20.98 +/- 0.57 nM, 36.87 +/- 3.35 nM, and 21.38 +/- 0.93 nM, respectively, and the IC50 values were 25.21 +/- 0.39 nM, 40.68 +/- 0.27 nM, and 23.61 +/- 0.25 nM, respectively. Radioligand binding kinetic results showed the association rate constants (k(+1)) for IEC-6, HT-29, and Caco2 cells were 0.22 +/- 0.04 min(-1), 0.29 +/- 0.04 min(-1), and 0.26 +/- 0.05 min(-1), respectively, and the dissociation rate constants (k(-1)) were 0.06 +/- 0.02 min(-1), 0.03 +/- 0.01 min(-1), and 0.04 +/- 0.01 min(-1), respectively. For the HaCaT cells, the K-d was 4.86 +/- 0.28x10(-8) M and B-max was 5.81 +/- 0.15x10(8) sites/cell, the very low specific binding between [I-125]-ITF and these cells made it impossible to calculate binding kinetic parameters. Conclusions: An ITF-specific receptor appears to be present on the three types of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6, HT-29, and Caco-2), and there may be no ITF receptor on epidermal cells.

Synthesis, α-adrenoceptors affinity and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonistic properties of some 1,4-substituted piperazine derivatives	PHARMAZIE			English	Article							AROXYETHYLAMINE DERIVATIVES; HYPOTENSIVE PROPERTIES; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; LIGAND DESIGN; SUBTYPES; AGONISTS; XANTHONE; BINDING; AGENTS	A series of different 1,4-substituted piperazine derivatives (1-11) was synthesized. It comprised 1-(substituted-phenoxyalkyl)-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine derivatives (1-5); 1,4-bis(substituted-phenoxyethyl)piperazine derivatives (6-8) and 1-(substituted-phenoxy)-3-(substituted-phenoxyalkylpiperazin-1-yl)propan-2-ol derivatives (9-11). All compounds were evaluated for affinity toward alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-receptors by radioligand binding assays on rat cerebral cortex using [H-3]prazosin and [H-3]clonidine as specific radioligand,, respectively. Furthermore alpha(1)-antagonistic properties were checked for most promising compounds (1-5 and 10) by means of inhibition of phenylephrine induced contraction in isolated rat aorta. Antagonistic potency stayed in agreement with radioligand binding results. The most active compounds (1-5) displaced [H-3]prazosin from cortical binding sites in low nanomolar range (K-i = 2.1-13.1 nM). Compound 10 showed slightly lower affinity for alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (K-i = 781 nM). Compounds 2-5 displayed the strongest antagonistic activity with pA(2) values ranging from 8.441 to 8.807. Compound 1 gave a pA(2) value of 7.868, while compound 10 showed the weakest antagonistic potency, giving a pA(2) value of 6.374. 1-[3-(2-Chloro-6-methylphenoxy)propyl]-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine hydrochloride (5) showed the best alpha(1)-affinity properties with a K-i(alpha(1)) value of 2.1 nM and it was 61.05 fold more selective toward alpha(1) than alpha(2)-receptors. The best properties showed 1-[3-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)propyl]-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine hydrochloride (4) with a K-i(alpha(1)) value of 2.4 nM, a 142.13 fold better selectivity to alpha(1)-over alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and the best antagonistic potency (pA(2) = 8.807). It is worth to emphasized that all most promising compounds possessed an 1-(o-methoxyphenyl)piperazine moiety which probably plays an important role in the affinity to alpha-adrenoceptors.

The in vivo distribution of [C-11]DASB binding was consistent with the known distribution of SERT sites in the cat brain in vitro with high uptakes of radioactivity in the midbrain and thalamus, intermediate levels in striatum, and modest to low levels of radioactivity in the neocortex and cerebellum, respectively. [C-11]-DASB binding potential (BP) values ranged from about 0.2 in the neocortex to 2.2 in the midbrain. Radioligand binding in all brain regions except cerebellum was markedly reduced following pretreatment with fluoxetine and citalopram, but was unaffected by pretreatment with GBR12909, maprotiline, and haloperidol, indicating specificity of [C-11]-DASB binding to the SERT. Two cats were each examined using PET and [C-11]-DASB in a longitudinal fashion (from 30 min and up to 24 days) following a single i.v. dose of. 1) fluoxetine, and 2) citalopram at different dosages. Both drugs induced similar degrees of SERT occupancy at 30 min postinjection (similar to90%). A comparison of citalopram and fluoxetine pharmacokinetics in the same animal and at the same dosage (1 mg/kg) showed that citalopram SERT occupancy and plasma half-lives were 9 times and 14 times shorter, respectively, than those of fluoxetine and norfluoxetine. In addition, studies performed after injection of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine suggested that high levels of synaptic serotonin may compete with [C-11]-DASB for binding on the SERT. These studies indicate that [C-11]DASB is a suitable PET radioligand for measuring drug occupancy of the SERT in vivo and has potential for monitoring in vivo changes in serotonin levels.

Significance and Value of PSMA Ligands in Prostate Cancer	AKTUELLE UROLOGIE			German	Article						prostate cancer; PSMA; PET; staging; radioligand therapy	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; BIOCHEMICAL RECURRENCE; GA-68-PSMA PET/CT; UTILITY; TOMOGRAPHY; RADIATION; DIAGNOSIS; ACCURACY; THERAPY; BIOPSY	In recent years, PSMA-targeting PET tracers such as Ga-68-PSMA-11 have shown promising results, thus contributing to a better management of prostate cancer patients. At the present time, Ga-68-PSMA-11 is most frequently used for diagnostic evaluation in the setting of biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. In this context, the Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT delivers superior detection rates compared to conventional imaging, especially for the detection of small, unsuspicious lesions or lesions in the presence of low PSA values. Furthermore, Ga-68-PSMA PET imaging seems to be an encouraging alternative for the staging of high-risk patients, particularly in combination with multiparametric MRI. In addition to the increasing use of PSMA ligands in clinical diagnostics, some variants have also been successfully applied in therapy. Advanced metastasized prostate cancer patients showed a good response to PSMA radioligand therapy with tolerable side-effects after failure of guideline-compliant treatment. Due to recent developments, PSMA ligands will continue to play an important role in the management of prostate cancer patients and will be more widely used in the future.

In binding studies using selective opioid radioligands, VV-hemorphin 7 exhibited a rank order of potency of mu > kappa much greater than delta. VV-hemorphin 7 was tritiated resulting in a compound with 1.03 TBq/mmol (27.8 Ci/mmol) specific radioactivity. The maximal number of binding sites was found to be 66.5 pmol/mg protein with an affinity of 82.1 nM in rat brain membranes. In competition studies, marked similarity was observed to the binding profile of the naturally occurring opioid heptapeptide Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe (MERF) and its analogues to their naloxone-insensitive binding site. The common -Arg-Phe sequence at the carboxyl terminal end, which is similar to those of other endogenous peptides (-Arg-Phe-NH2 in neuropeptide FF and FMRF-NH2) brings attention to the C-terminal end of the molecule and points to the possible existence of a common nonopioid binding site in mammals.

In addition to metabolism aspects, carrier-mediated transport, particularly secretion by ABC transporters, has been discussed as potentially relevant for this group of therapeutics. In this study, the psychoactive compounds perphenazine, flupentixol, domperidone, desmethyl clozapine, haloperidol, fluphenazine, fluvoxamine, olanzapine, levomepromazine, perazine, desmethyl perazine, clozapine, quetiapine and amisulpride were characterized in terms of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) affinity and transport. Experimental methods involved a radioligand displacement assay with [H-3]talinolol as radioligand and transport - as well as transport inhibition - studies of the P-gp substrate [H-3]talinolol across Caco-2 cell monolayers. In addition, the physicochemical descriptors log P and Deltalog P were determined to test potential correlations between transporter affinity and lipophilicity parameters. All of the tested antipsychotics showed affinity to P-gp albeit their IC50 values (concentration of competitor that displaced 50% of the bound radioligand) differed by a factor exceeding 1000, when compared using the transport inhibition assay. From the group of P-gp substrates, amisulpride and fluphenazine were selected for in-vivo drug-drug interaction studies in rats to demonstrate the in-vivo relevance of the in-vitro findings. Compounds were administered by intraperitoneal injection either alone or in combination with 50 mg kg(-1) ciclosporin. The concentration versus time profiles for both drugs were followed in serum as well as in brain tissues. Significant differences between the treatments with the antipsychotic alone versus the combination of antipsychotic with ciclosporin were found for amisulpride. The distribution of amisulpride to the brain was increased and systemic serum levels were likewise increased indicating decreased systemic clearance for the combination regimen. For fluphenazine, systemic levels with and without co-administraton of ciclosporin Were comparable while higher brain-to-serum concentration ratios were found after co-administration of ciclosporin. The findings are explained on the basis of the limited contribution of P-gp-mediated transport to the elimination of fluphenazine and to a direct effect with respect to its distribution into the brain.

We identified the subtypes present in wild-type (WT) and alpha(1B)-AR knockout (KO) mice livers at 3 and 4 months of age, and investigated their distribution in hepatocytes. 2 The fluorescent alpha(1)-AR antagonist quinazolinyl piperazine borate-dipyrromethene (QAPB) was used to visualise hepatic alpha(1)-ARs and radioligand binding with [H-3]-prazosin was used to quantify the alpha(1)-AR population. 3 QAPB and [H-3]-prazosin bound specifically to hepatic alpha(1)-ARs with nanomolar affinity. The cellular distribution of alpha(1)-ARs was similar in WT and alpha(1B)-AR KO hepatocytes; QAPB binding was distributed diffusely throughout the cell with no binding evident on the plasma membrane. Radioligand binding produced B-max values as follows: 3-month WT - 76 +/- 3.3 fmol mg(-1); 4-month WT - 50 +/- 3.1 fmol mg(-1); 3-month alpha(1B)-AR KO - 7.4 +/- 0.73 fmol mg(-1); 4-month alpha(1B)-AR KO 30 +/- 2.0 fmol mg(-1). 4 In 3- and 4-month WT liver, all antagonists acted competitively. RS100329 (alpha(1A)-selective) and BMY7378 (alpha(1D)-selective) bound with low affinities, indicating the presence alpha(1B)-ARs. In 4-month a1B-AR KO liver prazosin produced a biphasic curve, whereas RS100329 and BMY7378 produced monophasic curves of high and low affinity, respectively, indicating the presence Of alpha(1A)-ARs. 5 In conclusion, we have made the novel observation that alpha(1)-ARs can compensate for one another in the absence of the endogenously expressed receptor; yet there appears to be no subtype-specific subcellular location of alpha(1)-ARs; the WT livers express alpha(1B)-ARs, while alpha(1B)-AR KO livers express alpha(1A)-ARs. This study provides new insights into both hepatocyte and alpha(1)-AR biology.

In this study we have compared the agonist profile of NC and a novel NCR agonist, Ro65-6570, in a series of radioligand binding studies and effects on forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the recombinant human NCR (CHOhNCR) In addition, we report the effects of three antagonists, [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH2, J-113397 and III-BTD, on these responses. In radioligand binding studies Ro65-6570, [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH2, J-113397 and III-BTD displaced [H-3]NC with similar pK(i) values (8.4-8.8). This compares with a pK(D) of 10.2 for NC in a direct saturation experiment. [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH2 and J-113397 showed at least 100-fold selectivity over classical opioid receptors. Both NC and Ro65-6570 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of cAMP formation with pEC(50) values of 9.56 +/- 0.05 and 8.68 +/- 0.04, respectively. Maximum inhibition achieved was 100%. [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH2, 5-113397 and III-BTD produced a parallel rightward shift in the concentration-response curves to both NC and Ro65-6570 with pK(B) values of similar to6.5, similar to7.5 and similar to7.7, respectively. Importantly, all three antagonists were devoid of residual agonist activity. Collectively, these data indicate the value of Ro65-6570, [Nphe(1)]NC(1-13)NH2, 5-113397 and III-BTD in studies of the physiological role played by NC. However, due to the relatively poor selectivity of Ro65-6570 and III-BTD caution should be exercised when using tissues that co-express mu -opioid receptors.

A general synthetic method was developed for the conversion of small peptide substrates into potential affinity labels. The target peptides were synthesized using Phe(p-NH2) and a Boc/Fmoc orthogonal protection strategy which allowed for late functional group conversion of a p-amine group in the peptides to the desired affinity labeling moieties. A key step in the synthesis was the selective deprotection of a Boc group in the presence of a tert-butyl ester using trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMS-OTf). The target peptides were evaluated in radioligand binding experiments in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing delta or mu opioid receptors. The delta receptor affinities of the N,N-dibenzylleucine enkephalin analogues were 2.5-10-fold higher than those for the corresponding ICI-174,864 analogues. In general, substitution at the para position of Phe(4) decreased binding affinity at both delta and mu receptors in standard radioligand binding assays; the one exception was N,N-dibenzyl[Phe(p-NCS)(4)]leucine enkephalin (2) which exhibited a 2-fold increase in affinity for delta receptors (IC50 = 34.9 nM) compared to N,N-dibenzylleucine enkephalin (IC50 = 78.2 nM). The decreases in mu receptor affinities were greater than in delta receptor affinities so that all of the analogues tested exhibited significantly greater delta receptor selectivity than the unsubstituted parent peptides. Of the target peptides tested, only N,N-dibenzyl[Phe(p-NCS)(4)]leucine enkephalin (2) exhibited wash-resistant inhibition of radioligand binding to delta receptors. To our knowledge, 2 represents the first peptide-based affinity label to utilize an isothiocyanate group as the electrophilic affinity labeling moiety. As a result of this study, enkephalin analogue 2 emerges as a potential affinity label useful for the further study of delta opioid receptors.

Excessive activation of NMDA receptors is implicated in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including ischemic stroke, neuropathic pain, epilepsy, drug addition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. [F-18]GE179 is a promising PET probe for imaging functional NMDA receptor alterations (activated or 'open' channel) with a high binding affinity (K-d = 2.4 nM). Here, we report the production of the NMDA receptor radioligand [F-18]GE179 in a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facility through a one-pot two-step strategy. [F-18]GE179 was produced in approximately 110 min with a radiochemical yield of 12 +/- 6% (n = 4, decay corrected), radiochemical purity > 95%, molar activity of 146 +/- 32 GBq/mu mol (at the end of synthesis), an average mass of GE179 at 2.2 mu g/batch, and total impurities less than 0.5 mu g/batch (n = 4). The radio pharmaceutical dose meets all quality control (QC) criteria for human use, and is suitable for clinical PET studies of activated NMDA receptor ion channels.

We now report the synthesis and biochemical characterization of [H-3][(1S,2R)ACPC(2)]endomorphin-2 with a specific activity of 1.41 TBq/mmol (38.17 Ci/mmol). Specific binding of [3H][(1S,2R)ACPC2]endomorphin-2 was saturable and of high affinity with an equilibrium dissociation constant, K-d = 1.80 +/- 0.21 nM and receptor density, B-max = 345 +/- 27 fmol x mg protein(-1) at 25 degrees C in rat brain membranes. Similar affinity values were obtained in kinetic and displacement assays. Both Na+ and Gpp(NH)p decreased the affinity proving the agonist character of the radioligand. [H-3][(1S,2R)ACPC(2)]endomorphin-2 retained the mu-specificity of the parent peptide. The new radioligand will be a useful tool to map the topographical requirements of mu-opioid peptide binding due to its high affinity, selectivity and enzymatic stability. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

In vitro contraction experiments were performed with rat and human bladder strips. Radioligand binding and inositol phosphate accumulation studies were done with cells transfected with human M-2 or M-3 muscarinic receptors. Both extracts concentration-dependently (final concentrations 0.01-0.1%) inhibited carbachol-induced contraction of rat and human bladder with insurmountable antagonism. Radioligand binding experiments and inositol phosphate accumulation studies with cloned receptors demonstrated direct but non-competitive effects on muscarinic receptors. Reductions of KCl-induced bladder contraction demonstrated that inhibition by the higher extract concentrations also involved receptor-independent effects. We conclude that extracts from Rhois aromatica and Solidaginis virgaurea inhibit muscarinic receptor-mediated contraction of rat and human bladder. While this could contribute to the beneficial effects of these extracts in patients with bladder dysfunction, such therapeutic effects remain to be demonstrated in controlled clinical studies.

Rapid association and dissociation was observed with recombinant (HEK293 cells) and endogenous (SK-N-MC cells) human Y-1 and recombinant mouse Y-5 receptors. Recombinant ( HEK293) and endogenous (SMS-KAN) human Y-2 receptors bound both radiolabels comparable to the Y-1 receptors, but only minimal (similar to 20%) dissociation of both radiolabels was observed after long incubation time (>8 h). Furthermore, neither peptide nor small molecule Y-2 ligands efficiently competed for binding to Y 2 receptors once association binding had been initiated. The Y-2-selective antagonist BIIE0246 behaved as an insurmountable antagonist in functional assays when pre-incubated for 30 min before agonist addition, but was a competitive antagonist when co-applied with the agonist. These data show that Y-2 receptors in contrast to Y-1 and Y-5 receptors bind their ligands in an irreversible manner. Copyright (C) 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Previous studies have shown that the toxin interacts with the antagonist-receptor complex and slows the antagonist dissociation rate, possibly by binding to an allosteric site and impeding the access to and egress from the orthosteric binding pocket. In the present study, we investigated the action of MT7 on agonist-occupied receptors in functional and radioligand binding assays of the cloned human muscarinic M-1 receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. In time-course experiments, the addition of MT7 rapidly blocked the acetylcholine-stimulated guanosine-5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)triphosphate binding to membrane G proteins. Similarly, in acetylcholine-treated cells MT7 completely stopped the agonist-stimulated [H-3]inositol phosphate accumulation. In dissociation experiments using membranes pre-equilibrated with [H-3]acetylcholine, the addition of MT7 increased the rate of radioligand dissociation. The data indicate that MT7, while partially stabilizing the antagonist-receptor complex, effectively destabilizes the agonist-occupied muscarinic M-1 receptors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Targeted alpha-therapy using actinium-225 has been used for patients with end-stage disease who no longer responded to beta-therapy through the use of Lu-177-based radioligand therapy (RLT). In this study, we investigated and compared the therapeutic efficacy of [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB and [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 and assessed potential undesired side effects in the preclinical setting. Due to a dedicated albumin-binding entity integrated into [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB, this radioligand showed an enhanced blood circulation time and, hence, increased tumor uptake but also higher retention in normal tissues. The therapeutic efficacy of [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB was enhanced as compared to that of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617, yet, undesired side effects were in the same range for both radioligands. Our data suggest that [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB could be a powerful alternative to [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617, however, the safe therapeutic window should be carefully defined in clinical dose escalation studies. In the present study, SibuDAB, an albumin-binding PSMA ligand, was investigated in combination with actinium-225 and the data were compared with those of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617. In vitro, [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB and [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 showed similar tumor cell uptake and PSMA-binding affinities as their Lu-177-labeled counterparts. The in vitro binding to serum albumin in mouse and human blood plasma, respectively, was 2.8-fold and 1.4-fold increased for [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB as compared to [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB. In vivo, this characteristic was reflected by the longer retention of [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB in the blood than previously seen for [Lu-177]Lu-SibuDAB. Similar to [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617, [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB was well tolerated at 30 kBq per mouse. Differences in blood cell counts were observed between treated mice and untreated controls, but no major variations were observed between values obtained for [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB and [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617. [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB was considerably more effective to treat PSMA-positive tumor xenografts than [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617. Only 5 kBq per mouse were sufficient to eradicate the tumors, whereas tumor regrowth was observed for mice treated with 5 kBq [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 and only one out of six mice survived until the end of the study. The enhanced therapeutic efficacy of [Ac-225]Ac-SibuDAB as compared to that of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617 and reasonable safety data qualify this novel radioligand as a candidate for targeted alpha-therapy of prostate cancer.

We examined the reproducibility of [C-11]PBR28 binding in healthy subjects with quantification on a regional and voxel-by-voxel basis. In addition, we performed a preliminary analysis of diurnal changes in TSPO availability. Methods Twelve subjects were examined using a high-resolution research tomograph and [C-11]PBR28, six in the morning and afternoon of the same day, and six in the morning on two separate days. Regional volumes of distribution (V-T) were derived using a region-of-interest based two-tissue compartmental analysis (2TCM), as well as a parametric approach. Metabolite-corrected arterial plasma was used as input function. Results For the whole sample, the mean absolute variability in V (T) in the grey matter (GM) was 18.3 +/- 12.7 %. Intraclass correlation coefficients in GM regions ranged from 0.90 to 0.94. Reducing the time of analysis from 91 to 63 min yielded a variability of 16.9 +/- 14.9 %. There was a strong correlation between the parametric and 2TCM-derived GM values (r=0.99). A significant increase in GM V-T was observed between the morning and afternoon examinations when using secondary methods of quantification (p=0.028). In the subjects examined at the same time of the day, the absolute variability was 15.9 +/- 12.2 % for the 91-min 2TCM data. Conclusion V-T of [C-11]PBR28 binding showed medium reproducibility and high reliability in GM regions. Our findings support the use of parametric approaches for determining [C-11]PBR28 V-T values, and indicate that the acquisition time could be shortened. Diurnal changes in TSPO binding in the brain may be a potential confounder in clinical studies and should be investigated further.

Current theories favour multiple agent-specific neuronal actions for both general anaesthetics and antiepileptic drugs, but the pharmacological properties that distinguish them are poorly understood. We compared the interactions of representative agents from each class on their putative targets using well-characterized radioligand binding assays. Methods. Synaptosomes or membranes prepared from rat cerebral cortex were used to analyse drug effects on [S-35]t-butyl bicyclophosphorothionate ([S-35]TBPS) binding to the picrotoxinin site of GABA(A) receptors, [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha benzoate ([H-3]BTX-B) binding to site 2 of voltage-gated Na+ channels, (+)-[methyl-H-3]isopropyl 4-(2,1,3-benzoxadiazoI-4-yl)-1,4-dihydro-5-methoxycarboxyl -2,6-dimethyl-3-pyridinecarboxylate ([H-3]PN200-110; isradipine) binding to L-type Ca2+ channels, and [cyclohexyl-2,3-H-3](N)glibenclamide ([H-3]GB) binding to K-ATP channels. Results. I.V. anaesthetics other than ketamine preferentially inhibited [S-35]TBPS binding (etomidate approximate to alphaxalone > propofol > thiopental > pentobarbital). Volatile anaesthetics inhibited both [S-35]TBPS and [H-3]BTX-B binding with comparable potencies (halothane approximate to isoflurane approximate to enflurane). Antiepileptic drugs preferentially antagonized either [S-35]TBPS (diazepam > phenobarbital) or [H-3]BTX-B (phenytoin > carbamazepine) binding. Local anaesthetics (lidocaine, tertracaine) selectively antagonized [H-3]BTX-B binding. None of the drugs tested were potent antagonists of [H-3]PN200-110 or [H-3]GB binding. Conclusions. Comparative radioligand binding assays identified distinct classes of general anaesthetic and antiepileptic drugs based on their relative specificities for a defined target set. I.V. anaesthetics interacted preferentially with GABA(A) receptors, while volatile anaesthetics were essentially equipotent at Na+ channels and GABA(A) receptors. Antiepileptic drugs could be classified by preferential actions at either Na+ channels or GABA(A) receptors. Anaesthetics and antiepileptic drugs have agent-specific effects on radioligand binding. Both general anaesthetics and antiepileptic drugs interact with Na+ channels and GABA(A) receptors at therapeutic concentrations, in most cases with little selectivity.

The association (K (+ 1)) and dissociation (K (- 1)) rate constants of binding were 0.758/-0.064 min(-1), mmol and 0.0042+/-0.0002 min(-1), respectively, yielding dissociation constants (K(D)s) of 5.66+/-0.44 nM (n = 4). 3 Specific [H-3]-BWA868C bound to DP receptors with a high affinity (K-D = 1.45+/-0.01 nM, n = 3) and to a finite, saturable number of binding sites (B-max = 21.1 +/- 0.6 nmol g(-1) wet weight). 4 DP receptor class prostanoids (e.g. ZK118182, BW245C, BWA868C, PGD,) exhibited high (nanomolar) affinities for [H-3]-BWA866C binding, while prostanoids selective for EP, FP, IP and TP receptors showed a low (micromolar) affinity. 5 Specific DP receptor binding sites were autoradiographically localized on the ciliary epithelium/ process, longitudinal and circular ciliary muscles, retinal choroid and iris in human eye sections using [(3H)]-BWA868C. While [H-3]-PGD(2) yielded similar quantitative distribution of DP receptors as [H-3]-BWA868C, the level of non-specific binding observed with [H-3]-PGD(2) was significantly greater than that observed with [H-3]-BWA868C. 6 Tt is concluded that [H-3]-BWA868C is a high-affinity and very specific DP receptor radioligand capable of selectively labelling the DP receptor. [H-3]-BWA868C may prove useful for future homogenate-based and autoradiographic studies on the DP receptor.

Biochemical response was based on the relative change of serum PSA according to PCWG3 criteria, while radiographic response referred to the relative change of PSMA-derived total viable tumor volumes expressed as total lesion PSMA (TLP).ResultsAfter one cycle of RLT, biochemical partial response (PR) was seen in 8/40 (20.0%), stable disease (SD) in 22/40 (55.0%), and progressive disease (PD) in 10/40 (25%) patients. In PSMA PET, very early molecular PR was observed in 12 (30.0%), SD in 19 (47.5%), and PD in 9 (22.5%) subjects. The PSA and TLP nadir were achieved after a median of 1 (1-5) and 2 (1-6) cycles, respectively. Nineteen (47.5%) patients showed overall biochemical PR, 11 (27.5%) had SD, and 10 (25%) experienced PD. In PSMA-directed PET, 4 patients experienced molecular complete response (CR), 24 (60.0%) had PR, 4 (10.0%) SD, and 8 (20.0%) PD. Early biochemical or radiographic response was not associated with longer overall survival (OS). Overall biochemical responders had a nearly significantly longer median OS (22.7 months) than non-responders (14.4 months, p = 0.08). Early PSA progression was associated with shorter OS (12.2 months), compared to biochemical SD/PR (18.7 months, p = 0.09).ConclusionIn this retrospective cohort, there was no association between early PSMA PET radiographic response and overall survival; hence, treatment should not be prematurely discontinued. In contrast, early PSA progression after one cycle of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I & T RLT was an indicator of overall progression and poor clinical outcome.

New treatment approaches for and ongoing trials in metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer	UROLOGIE			German	Article						Androgen receptor; Radioligand therapy; PARP; AKT; CDK4/6	THERAPY	Background: For many years, therapy for metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC) was dominated by monotherapy using androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). With the demonstration of survival benefit with intensified systemic therapy from the CHAARTED and STAMPEDE trials, this has fundamentally changed. We analyzed the phase III trials that led to the change in therapy in mHSPC. In addition, we summarized ongoing trials in mHSPC.Objectives: The ongoing studies and current data on systemic therapy in mHSPC were analyzed.Results: Monotherapy with ADT is no longer considered the standard therapy for mHSPC. Combination therapy with ADT and novel androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTAs: abiraterone, apalutamide, enzalutamide) is now the established standard option. The added value of further intensification of therapy was demonstrated in the first trials of triple therapy with ADT + docetaxel + darolutamide or abiraterone in mHSPC. Current studies are also investigating new forms of therapy. Lutetium177PSMA radioligand therapy is an established standard in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and is currently being evaluated in combination with ADT + ARTA in mHSPC. The use of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have been established in mCRPC. Current studies are showing early evidence of benefit from novel combination therapies of PARPi+ ARTA, which represent a further expansion of the therapeutic landscape. Experimental therapies are testing another combination, such as an AKT inhibitor with ARTA in patients with PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) loss. Based on the proof of principle in mCRPC, this combination is now being evaluated in earlier stage mHSPC. Other experimental therapies in clinical testing include inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases (CDK).Conclusions: Combination therapies are the current standard of care for mHSPC, with the combination of ADT + ARTA dominating. Preliminary results underline the importance of further intensification of therapy by means of triple therapy. However, novel combinations with radioligand therapy or PARP inhibitors are also promising in the treatment of mHSPC. Preliminary results show the principle efficacy of AKT inhibitors in patients with PTEN loss, which similar to therapy with CDK4/6 inhibitors still have to prove their clinical relevance in randomized trials.

Radioligand [F-18]15 displays central nervous system drug-like properties, including mGluR4 affinity, potent mGluR4 PAM activity, and selectivity against other mGluRs, as well as sufficient metabolic stability. Radiosynthesis was carried out in two steps. The radiochemical yield of [F-18]15 was 11.6 +/- 2.9% (n = 7, decay corrected) with a purity of 99% and a molar activity of 84.1 +/- 11.8 GBq/mu mol. Ex vivo biodistribution studies showed reversible binding of [F-18]15 in all investigated tissues including the brain, liver, heart, lungs, and kidneys. PET imaging studies in male Sprague Dawley rats showed that [F-18]15 accumulates in the brain regions known to express mGluR4. Pretreatment with the unlabeled mGluR4 PAM compounds 13 (methylthio analogue) and 15 showed significant dose-dependent blocking effects. These results suggest that [F-18]15 is a promising radioligand for PET imaging mGluR4 in the brain.

Cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor expression and affinity in the rat hippocampus following bilateral vestibular deafferentation	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Cannabinoid receptors; Hippocampus; Vestibular lesions; Rat brain	MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; LONG-TERM CHANGES; SYSTEM; CHANNELS; REQUIRE; BINDING; LESIONS; DAMAGE	Numerous studies have shown that bilateral vestibular deafferentation (BVD) results in spatial memory deficits and hippocampal dysfunction in rats and humans. Since cannabinoid CB1 receptors are well known to regulate synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, we investigated whether BVD resulted in changes in CB1 receptor expression and affinity in the rat hippocampus at 1,3 and 7 days post-surgery, using a combination of Western blotting and radioligand binding. Using Western blotting, we found that CB1 receptor expression was significantly lower in BVD animals compared to sham controls only in the CA3 area across the 3 time points (P = 0.03). CB1 receptor expression decreased significantly over time for both the BVD and sham animals (P = 0.000). The radioligand binding assays showed no significant change in the IC50 of the CB1 receptor for the cannabinoid CB1/CB2 receptor agonist, WIN55,212-2. These results suggest that the CB1 receptor down-regulates in the CA3 region of the hippocampus following BVD, but with no changes in the affinity of the CBI receptor for WIN55,212-2.

On the use of cells or membranes for receptor binding: Growth hormone secretagogues	ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Receptor binding; Intact cell; Isolated membranes; Growth hormone secretagogues	PITUITARY; GHRELIN; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONISTS; RELEASE; INVITRO; SODIUM	Receptor binding techniques have been widely used in different biochemical applications, with isolated membranes being the most used receptor preparation in this type of assays. In this study, intact cells were compared with isolated membranes as receptor support for radioligand receptor binding assay. The growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a) expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells was used as a model of G-protein-coupled receptors. Differences between using intact cells in suspension and using isolated membranes were evaluated for different aspects of the receptor binding assay: total binding variations while both receptor preparations remain on ice, modifications in incubation conditions, saturation, and competition using different agonists. Intact cells are more prone to variability. Although under optimized settings both preparations were equivalent, the K-d value for intact cells was three times higher than that using isolated membranes. However, no significant differences were observed in competition assays obtaining practically identical K-i values for all ligands tested. For the GHSR-1a, isolated membranes are the better choice if particular incubation conditions are required (less variability), whereas intact cells yield easy, fast, and physiological conditions for receptor binding assays.

Using a battery of radioligand binding assays, we sought to characterize GPCR recognition binding sites on HeLaS3 tumor cells. High levels of binding of the selective serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist [H-3]8-OH-DPAT were observed in these cells. Saturation and homologous competition experiments indicated that [H-3]8-OH-DPAT bound different populations of high- and low-affinity sites. In competition experiments, several serotonergic compounds displaced [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding with low potency from its high-affinity binding sites, suggesting that low-affinity binding is the predominant mode of binding. A variety of drugs targeting different classes of receptors did not affect [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding. These observations may help elucidate the pathophysiological and functional relevance of 5-HT receptors in tumor cells and link GPCRs and tumorigenic mechanisms to pharmacological and chemotherapeutic paradigms.

Binding sites for the radilogand are widespreadly distributed in the rat forebrain, showing the highest density in hypothalamus. K-d values were in the range 1-2 nM. Diadenosine tetraphosphate (Ap(4)A) and diethenoadenosine tetraphosphate, epsilon-(Ap(4)A), displaced the radioligand, indicating dinucleotide binding to ADP beta S-recognizing P2Y receptors. Activity ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP1), able to hydrolyze Ap(4)A and other diadenosine polyphosphates, is also widely distributed through the rat forebrain, with the highest activity in hypothalamus. These results suggests that AP4A signalling mediated by P2Y(1,12,13) receptors and enzymatically regulated by NPP1 activity may be particularly important in hypothalamus and add new support for neurotransmitter/neuromodulatory functions of diadenosine polyphosphates in brain.

The activity of VIP was examined in radioligand binding assays at mouse sst(1-5), rat sst(1-2) and human sst(1-5) receptors; or at human tumours preferentially expressing each of the five SRIF receptors. Moreover, SRIF was investigated at human tumoral tissues known to exclusively express specific VIP/PACAP receptor(s). VIP had no significant effect on any of the radioligand binding sites of the SRIF receptor family of rat, mouse or human origin tested. Conversely, SRIF did not interfere with the human VIP/PACAP binding sites tested. Taken together, the results cast reservation on the claimed cross-competition between VIP and SRIF at, specifically human sst(3) receptors, or any of the cloned SRIF or VIP/PACAP receptors recognised to date.

Despite many attempts, it has not been possible to develop an appropriate radioligand for imaging aggregated alpha-synuclein in the brain for diagnosing, e.g., Parkinson's Disease. Access to a large animal model with alpha-synuclein pathology would critically enable a more translationally appropriate evaluation of novel radioligands. We here establish a pig model with cerebral injections of alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils or brain homogenate from postmortem human brain tissue from individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or dementia with Lewy body (DLB) into the pig's brain, using minimally invasive surgery and validated against saline injections. In the absence of a suitable alpha-synuclein radioligand, we validated the model with the unselective amyloid-beta tracer [C-11]PIB, which has a high affinity for beta-sheet structures in aggregates. Gadolinium-enhanced MRI confirmed that the blood-brain barrier was intact. A few hours post-injection, pigs were PET scanned with [C-11]PIB. Quantification was done with Logan invasive graphical analysis and simplified reference tissue model 2 using the occipital cortex as a reference region. After the scan, we retrieved the brains to confirm successful injection using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry. We found four times higher [C-11]PIB uptake in AD-homogenate-injected regions and two times higher uptake in regions injected with alpha-synuclein-preformed-fibrils compared to saline. The [C-11]PIB uptake was the same in non-injected (occipital cortex, cerebellum) and injected (DLB-homogenate, saline) regions. With its large brain and ability to undergo repeated PET scans as well as neurosurgical procedures, the pig provides a robust, cost-effective, and good translational model for assessment of novel radioligands including, but not limited to, proteinopathies.

Initiated by the German Society of Nuclear Medicine, a retrospective multicenter data analysis was started in 2015 to evaluate efficacy and safety of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in a large cohort of patients. Methods: One hundred forty-five patients (median age, 73 y; range, 43-88 y) with mCRPC were treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 in 12 therapy centers between February 2014 and July 2015 with 1-4 therapy cycles and an activity range of 2-8 GBq per cycle. Toxicity was categorized by the common toxicity criteria for adverse events (version 4.0) on the basis of serial blood tests and the attending physician's report. The primary endpoint for efficacy was biochemical response as defined by a prostate-specific antigen decline 50% from baseline to at least 2 wk after the start of RLT. Results: A total of 248 therapy cycles were performed in 145 patients. Data for biochemical response in 99 patients as well as data for physician-reported and laboratory-based toxicity in 145 and 121 patients, respectively, were available. The median follow-up was 16 wk (range, 2-30 wk). Nineteen patients died during the observation period. Grade 3-4 hematotoxicity occurred in 18 patients: 10%, 4%, and 3% of the patients experienced anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, respectively. Xerostomia occurred in 8%. The overall biochemical response rate was 45% after all therapy cycles, whereas 40% of patients already responded after a single cycle. Elevated alkaline phosphatase and the presence of visceral metastases were negative predictors and the total number of therapy cycles positive predictors of biochemical response. Conclusion: The present retrospective multicenter study of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT demonstrates favorable safety and high efficacy exceeding those of other third-line systemic therapies in mCRPC patients. Future phase II/III studies are warranted to elucidate the survival benefit of this new therapy in patients with mCRPC.

Evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PipISB and [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PipISB in Monkey as Candidate Radioligands for Imaging Brain Cannabinoid Type-1 Receptors In Vivo	SYNAPSE			English	Article						positron emission tomography; carbon-11; fluorine-18; radiotracer	INVERSE AGONIST; RAT-BRAIN; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; PET; LOCALIZATION; SR141716A; BINDS; DRONABINOL; ANOREXIA; OBESITY	N-(4-Fluorobenzyl)-4-[3-(piperidin-1-yl)indole-1-sulfonyl]benzamide] (PipISB, 3) is a selective and high-potency cannabinoid subtype-1 (CBI) receptor inverse agonist. We have previously reported radiosyntheses of [C-11]3 and [F-18]3. Here, we aimed to evaluate the uptake and CB, receptor-specific binding of each radioligand in monkey brain in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). [C-11]3 or [F-18]3 was injected intravenously into rhesus or cynomolgus monkey, respectively, and examined with PET at baseline or after pretreatment with a receptor-saturating dose of CB1 receptor-selective ligand (3 for [C-11]3 or 8 for [F-18](3)). In one PET experiment, the dose of 3 was administered at 100 min after [C-11]3. Relative plasma concentrations of radioligand and radiometabolites were concurrently measured in baseline experiments with high-performance liquid chromatography. Brain radioactivity uptake was highest in striatum and cerebellum, and it reached 170-270% standardized uptake value (SUV) at 120 min after injection of [C-11](3) and 180% SUV at 240 min after injection of [F-18](3). Radioactivity was well retained in all CBI receptor-rich regions. No reference region could be identified for nonspecifically bound radioligand. Under CB1 receptor pretreatment and displacement conditions, initial brain uptakes of radioactivity were similar to those at baseline. Regional brain radioactivity concentrations then became homogeneous and diminished to between 70 and 80% SUV at 120 min after injection of [C-11]3 and to 25% SUV at 240 min after injection of [F-18]3. [F-18]3 was not defluorinated but was metabolized to less lipophilic radiometabolites, as was [C-11]3. Hence, [C-11]3 and [F-18]3 showed high CBI receptor-specific binding in monkey brain in vivo and merit further investigation as prospective PET radioligands in humans. Synapse 63:22-30, 2009.

Therapeutic approaches include multimodal therapy and chemotherapeutics, with cisplatin being the drug of choice, but response rates of only up to 14% indicate very poor outcomes. Effective treatment options are lacking. Besides the diagnostic usage of radioligands in positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT), the endo-radioligand therapy with Lu177 has been proven as a powerful tool in cancer therapy. Mesothelin (MSLN) and C-XC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) are membrane-bound proteins, expressed in certain cancers, and thus are promising targets for endo-radiotherapy. A significant portion of high MSLN-or CXCR4-expressing tumors within the MPM may open the field for this sophisticated treatment approach in the near future. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour specimens from 105 patients suffering from MPM and treated at the Lung Cancer Centre of Essen and at the Helios Klinikum Emil von Behring Berlin were screened. The tumour samples were arranged in tissue microarrays. We immunohistochemically stained the tumour samples against MSLN and CXCR4. The protein expressions of the stainings were scored by a pathologist by using a semiquantitative method. The data obtained were correlated with the clinical outcome. Overall, 77.1% of the analysed tumours showed CXCR4 protein expression (25.7% of them at high expression level (Score 3)). 48.6% of all samples showed an overall strong staining (Score = 2), 59% of the investigated tumours showed MSLN protein expression (10.5% of them at high expression (Score 3)), and 36.2% of all samples showed an overall strong staining (Score = 2). Our results show significant tissue expression levels, for both CXCR4 and MSLN protein, in a major portion of clinical MPM samples. One-third of patients showed outstanding immunoexpression of at least one of these markers, making them interesting candidates for radioligand-based PET/CT diagnostics and follow-up and furthermore may profit from endo-radiotherapy.

Specifically, it had high brain penetration and specific binding that was demonstrated in both rodents and non-human primates. Here, we present the first automatic cGMP-level production of [F-18]P10A-1910 and translational PET/MRI study in living human brains. Successful one-step radiolabeling of [F-18]P10A-1910 on a GE TRACERlab FX2N synthesis module was realized via two different methods. First, formulated [F-18]P10A-1910 was derived from heating spirocyclic iodonium ylide in a tetra-n-butyl ammonium methanesulfonate solution. At the end of synthesis, it was obtained in non-decay corrected radiochemical yields (n.d.c. RCYs) of 12.4 +/- 1.3%, with molar activities (MAs) of 90.3 +/- 12.6 mu mol (n = 7) (Method I). The boronic pinacol ester combined with copper and oxygen also delivered the radioligand with 16.8 +/- 1.0% n. d.c. RCYs and 77.3 +/- 20.7 GBq/mu mol (n = 7) MAs after formulation (Method II). The radiochemical purity, radionuclidic purity, solvent residue, sterility, endotoxin content and other parameters were all validated for human use. Consistent with the distribution of PDE10A in the brain, escalating uptake of [F-18]P10A-1910 was observed in the order of cerebellum (reference region), substantial nigra, caudate and putamen. The non-displaceable binding potential (BP (ND)) was estimated by simplified reference-tissue model (SRTM); linear regressions demonstrated that BP (ND) was well correlated with the most widely used semiquantitative parameter SUV. The strongest correlation was observed with SUV(50-60 min) (R (2) = 0.966, p < 0.01). Collectively, these results indicated that a static scan protocol could be easily performed for PET imaging of PDE10A. Most importantly, that [F-18]P10A-1910 is a promising radioligand to clinically quantify PDE10A.

Knowledge on regulatory factors that promote prostate cancer (PCa) progression may contribute to targeting prostate cancer more effectively. We aimed at the stimulation of PCa cell lines using the substances 5-aza-2 '-deoxycitidine (5-aza-dC) and valproic acid (VPA) to achieve increased prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression. PC3, PC3-PSMA, and LNCaP cells were incubated with varying concentrations of 5-aza-dC and VPA to investigate the cell-bound activity of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Stimulation effects on both the genetically modified cell line PC3-PSMA and the endogenously PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells were demonstrated by increased cellular uptake of the radioligand. For PC3-PSMA cells, the fraction of cell-bound radioactivity was enhanced by about 20-fold compared to that of the unstimulated cells. Our study reveals an increased radioligand uptake mediated by stimulation for both PC3-PSMA and LNCaP cell lines. In perspective of an enhanced PSMA expression, the present study might contribute to advanced radionuclide therapy approaches that improve the therapeutic efficacy, as well as combined treatment options.

Binding affinities at both D2R and D3R were higher when determined in competition with the agonist radioligand [H-3]7-hydroxy-N,N-dipropy1-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT) than with the antagonist radioligand [H-3]N-methylspiperone. Although 1 was confirmed as a D2R-preferential agonist, its selectivity in binding and functional studies was lower than previously reported. All analogues were determined to be D2R/D3R agonists in both G(o)BRET and mitogenesis functional assays. Loss of efficacy was detected for the N-1-substituted analogues at D3R. In contrast, the N-5-alkyl-substituted analogues, and notably the n-butyl-arylamides (22b and 22c), all showed improved affinity at D2R over 1 with neither a loss of efficacy nor an increase in selectivity. Computational modeling provided a structural basis for the D2R selectivity of 1, illustrating how subtle differences in the highly homologous orthosteric binding site (OBS) differentially affect D2R/D3R affinity and functional efficacy.

In the present work with HEK-293 cells expressing the human NET (hNET), potential underlying causes for this discrepancy have been addressed: ambient temperature of the binding assay, buffer in the assay, preparation used for source of the NET, and radioligand. The results indicate that the standard [H-3]nisoxetine binding assay at 0 degrees C with cell membrane preparations in high Na+ buffer underestimates the functional potency of compounds related to cocaine and GBR 12909; in drug development studies it is advisable to either carry out [H-3]nisoxetine binding assays with intact cells under uptake conditions, or perform classical [H-3]NE uptake studies with intact cells (or with synaptosomes from brain tissue).

It has been assumed previously that downregulation involves endocytosis. The present study hypothesized that AT(1) receptor downregulation occurs independently of receptor endocytosis or G protein coupling. Mutant AT(1) receptors with carboxy-terminal deletions internalized <5% of radioligand compared with 65% for wild-type AT(1) receptors. The truncated AT(1) receptors retained the ability to undergo downregulation. These data suggest the existence of an alternative pathway to AT(1) receptor degradation that does not require endocytosis, per se. Point mutations in either the second transmembrane region or second intracellular loop impaired G protein (G(q)) coupling. These receptors exhibited a biphasic pattern of downregulation. The earliest phase of downregulation (0-2 h) was independent of coupling to G(q) but no additional downregulation was observed after 2 h of ANG II exposure in the receptors with impaired coupling to G(q). These data suggest that coupling to G(q) is required for the later phase (2-24 h) of AT(1) receptor downregulation.

We conducted a meta-analysis of the therapeutic effects of PSMA-targeting a-therapy (Ac-225-PSMA radioligand therapy [RLT]) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: A systematic search was performed using the keywords "mCRPC," "Ac-225-PSMA," and "alpha therapy." Therapeutic responses were analyzed as the pooled proportions of patients with more than a 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline and any PSA decline. Survival outcomes were analyzed by estimating summary survival curves for progression-free survival and overall survival. Adverse events were analyzed as the pooled proportions of patients with xerostomia and severe hematotoxicity (anemia, leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia). Results: Nine studies with 263 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled proportions of patients with more than a 50% PSA decline and any PSA decline were 60.99% (95% CI, 54.92%-66.83%) and 83.57% (95% CI, 78.62%-87.77%), respectively. The estimatedmean progression-free survival and mean overall survival were 9.15 mo (95% CI, 6.69-11.03 mo) and 11.77 mo (95% CI, 9.51-13.49 mo), respectively. The pooled proportions of patients with adverse events were 62.81% (95% CI, 39.34%-83.46%) for xerostomia, 14.39% (95% CI, 7.76%-22.63%) for anemia, 4.12% (95% CI, 0.97%-9.31%) for leukocytopenia, and 7.18% (95% CI, 2.70%-13.57%) for thrombocytopenia. Conclusion: In our study, around 61% of patients had more than a 50% PSA decline and 84% of patients had any PSA decline after Ac-225-PSMA RLT. The common adverse events in Ac-225-PSMA RLT were xerostomia in 63% of patients and severe hematotoxicity in 4%-14% of patients.

It administrates Ac-225- or Lu-177-labeled ligands for the targeted killing of tumor cells. Differently from X- or gamma-ray, for the emitted alpha or beta particles the ionization of the DNA molecule is less dependent on the tissue oxygenation status. Furthermore, the diffusion range of electrons in a tumor is much larger than the volume typically spanned by hypoxic regions. Therefore, hypoxia is less investigated as an influential factor for PSMA-directed RLT, in particular with beta emitters. This study proposes an in silico approach to theoretically investigate the influence of tumor hypoxia on the PSMA-directed RLT. Based on mice histology images, the distribution of the radiopharmaceuticals was simulated with an in silico PBPK-based convection-reaction-diffusion model. Three anti-CD31 immunohistochemistry slices were used to simulate the tumor microenvironment. Ten regions of interest with varying hypoxia severity were analyzed. A kernel-based method was developed for dose calculation. The cell survival probability was calculated according to the linear-quadratic model. The statistical analysis performed on all the regions of interest (ROIs) shows more heterogeneous dose distributions obtained with Ac-225 compared to Lu-177. The higher homogeneity of Lu-177-PSMA-ligand treatment is due to the larger range covered by the emitted beta particles. The dose-to-tissue histogram (DTH) metric shows that in poorly vascularized ROIs only 10% of radiobiological hypoxic tissue receives the target dose using Lu-177-PSMA-ligand treatment. This percentage drops down to 5% using Ac-225. In highly vascularized ROIs, the percentage of hypoxic tissue receiving the target dose increases to more than 85% and 65% for the Lu-177 and Ac-225-PSMA-ligands, respectively. The in silico study demonstrated that the reduced vascularization of the tumor strongly influences the dose delivered by PSMA-directed RLT, especially in hypoxic regions and consequently the treatment outcome.

We analysed retrospectively the early side effects and the response rate in the first patients, who received a therapy with Lu-PSMA in our departments. Methods: RLT was performed in ten hormone-and/or chemo-refractory patients with distant metastases and progressive disease (mean age 73.5 years). Ga-68-PSMA HBED-CC PET/CT was performed in all patients prior to RLT. The median PSA level prior to the therapy was 298.5 ng/ml (range 5-853 ng/ml). All patients received CBC, renal and liver function tests the day before and 2 days after application (mean administered activity 5.6 GBq, range 4.1-6.1 GBq), followed by further tests every 2 weeks. All patients were contacted by telephone every week regarding side effects or any positive and negative changes. Results: Eight weeks after the therapy, seven patients (70 %) experienced a PSA decline, of whom six experienced more than 30 % and five more than 50 %. Three patients showed a progressive disease according to the PSA increase. No patient experienced any side effects immediately after injection of Lu-PSMA. Relevant hematotoxicity (grade 3 or 4) occurred 7 weeks after the administration in just one patient. The same patient showed a leucopenia grade 2. Two patients showed a disturbance of only 1 hematologic cell line, whereas one patient showed a reduction of grades 1 and 2 in leucocytes and thrombocytes, respectively. Six patients did not show any hematotoxicity during the 8 weeks after therapy. There was no relevant nephrotoxicity (grade 3 or 4). Conclusions: Our initial results indicate that RLT with Lu-PSMA is safe and seems to have low early side-effect profile. A relevant PSA decline was detected in 70 % of patients.

Herein, binding of the novel non-imidazole H-3 receptor radioligand [H-3]A-349821 to membranes expressing native or recombinant H-3 receptors from rat or human sources was characterized and compared with the binding of the agonist [H-3]N-alpha-methylhistamine ([H-3]N alpha MH). 2 [H-3] A-349821 bound with high affinity and specificity to an apparent single class of saturable sites and recognized human H-3 receptors with 10-fold higher affinity compared to rat H-3 receptors. [H-3] A-349821 detected larger populations of receptors compared to [H-3] NaMH. 3 Displacement of [H-3]A-349821 binding by H-3 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists was monophasic, suggesting recognition of a single binding site, while that of H-3 receptor agonists was biphasic, suggesting recognition of both high- and low-affinity H-3 receptor sites. 4 pK(i) values of high- affinity binding sites for H-3 receptor competitors utilizing [H-3]A-349821 were highly correlated with pKi values obtained with [H-3] NaMH, consistent with labelling of H-3 receptors by [H-3] A-349821. 5 Unlike assays utilizing [H-3] NaMH, addition of GDP had no effect on saturation parameters measured with [H-3]A-349821, while displacement of [H-3]A-349821 binding by the H-3 receptor agonist histamine was sensitive to GDP. 6 In conclusion, [H-3]A-349821 labels interconvertible high- and low-affinity states of the H-3 receptor, and displays improved selectivity over imidazole-containing H-3 receptor antagonist radioligands. [H-3] A-349821 competition studies showed significant differences in the proportions and potencies of high- and low-affinity sites across species, providing new information about the fundamental pharmacological nature of H-3 receptors.

We recently reported the initial characterization of a NanoBRET-based conformational histamine H-3 receptor (H3R) biosensor that allowed the detection of both (partial) agonism and inverse agonism on living cells in a microplate reader assay format upon stimulation with H3R ligands. In the current study, we have further characterized this H3R biosensor on intact cells by monitoring the effect of consecutive ligand injections in time and evaluating its compatibility with photopharmacological ligands that contain a light-sensitive azobenzene moiety for photo-switching. In addition, we have validated the H3R biosensor in membrane preparations and found that observed potency values better correlated with binding affinity values that were measured in radioligand competition binding assays on membranes. Hence, the H3R conformational biosensor in membranes might be a ready-to-use, high-throughput alternative for radioligand binding assays that in addition can also detect ligand efficacies with comparable values as the intact cell assay.

In this study, the in vivo distribution and kinetics of (-)-[C-11]OMV were evaluated in comparison with [C-11]SA4503 in disability model monkeys produced by selectively destroying the p75NTR-positive cells in the right hemisphere of the brain using positron emission tomography. Time-activity curves of (-)-[C-11]OMV showed peaks within 20 min in regions rich in acetylcholine transporters (AchT). (-)-[C-11]OMV binding in the ipsilateral cortex to the lesion was significantly reduced by 22.0% +/- 6.7% when compared with that in the contralateral region. The decrease (19.3% +/- 2.2%) in (-)-[C-11]OMV binding in the ipsilateral temporal cortex to the lesion was greater than that (7.4% +/- 4.6%) of [C-11]SA4503.

Functional and pathological implications	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Chagas' disease; myocardial contractility; cruzipain; autoantibodies; cardiac cholinoceptors	HUMAN CHAGASIC IGG; INTRACELLULAR SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION; BETA-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI; T-CELL; MICE; DISEASE; SYSTEM; ASSOCIATION; PROTEINASE	The goal of this study was to investigate whether cruzipain, a Trypanosoma cruzi immunodominant antigen, was able to induce antibodies reactive to the cardiac M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M-2 mAChR). Immunization with cruzipain that was devoid of enzyme activity triggered IgG antibodies against cardiac M-2 mAChR. By radioligand competition assay we proved that the anti-cruzipain IgG fraction, purified from serum, inhibited binding of the specific M-2 mAChR radioligand [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate. We also demonstrated that anti-cruzipain IgG reacted against the second extracellular loop of the M-2 mAChR. The corresponding affinity-purified serum anti-M(2)e2 IgG (reacting against a synthetic peptide corresponding to this loop in humans) displayed agonist-like activity associated with specific M-2 mAChR activation - increase of cGMP, inositol phosphate accumulation and nitric oxide synthase activity - triggering a decrease in myocardial contractility. Moreover, the same IgG fraction decreased heart frequency, related to inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. These results imply that cruzipain plays a role in the production of antibodies against M-2 mAChR, which have been related to the pathogenesis of dysautonomic syndrome described in Chagas' disease.

In the present study, the binding characteristics of F-18-memantine was examined in five healthy volunteers. In humans. F-18-memantine was homogeneously distributed in gray matter i.e. cortex and basal ganglia regions, as well as the cerebellum. No radioactive metabolites were detected in plasma during the time-frame of the PET studies. The uptake of F-18-memantine in receptor-rich re-ions such as striatum and frontal cortex could be well described by a 1-tissue compartment model. The DV" values of all gray matter regions were similar and ranged from 15 to 20 ml/ml. The white matter showed lower DV" values of 15 +/- 1.4 ml/ml. These results suggest that F-18-memantine distribution in human brain does not reflect the regional NMDA receptor concentration, and therefore, this radioligand is not suitable for the PET imaging of the NMDA receptors.

This indicates that oral nicardipine occupied approximately 15-20% of L-type Ca2+ channels. A progressive occupancy of Ca2+ channels was observed between six and 12 h after nicardipine administration. Twelve hours after drug administration, approximately 65-70% of Ca2+ channels were occupied. These findings indicate that oral treatment with 3 mg/kg of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) occupies L-type Ca2+ channels in rat brain by more than 40% from the 6th to the 24th h after drug administration. This suggests that an oral dose of nicardipine (sustained-release formulation) induces a significant occupancy of L-type Ca2+ channels in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus for about one day. The possible clinico-therapeutic relevance of this observation is discussed.

However, it is not clear whether ac-RYYRWK-NH2 is truly selective for the NC receptor, and ac-RYYRWK-NH2 has therefore been radiolabelled and characterised in receptor-binding experiments. Saturation experiments with [H-3]ac-RYYRWK-NH2 binding to rat cortical membranes revealed a single high affinity site for [H-3]ac-RYYRWK-NH2 (K-d=0.071+/-0.018 nM; B-max=22+/-2 fmol/mg protein). Uncoupling of the G-proteins resulted in a signficiant 45% increase in K-d and no change in B-max. [H-3]ac-RYYRWK-NH2 binding to rat cortical membranes or to membranes from baby hamster kidney cells expressing human orphan opioid receptor-like (ORL1) was displaced by NC and ac-RYYRWK-NH2 to the same extent. The following rank order of potency was observed: ac-RYYRWK-NH2 > [Tyr(14)]NC-OH = NC-OH = NC-NH2 > NC, H-(1-13)-NH2 > NC(1-12)-NH2 >> NC(1-11)-NH2 and, thus, displayed a typical NC receptor pharmacology. Novel cyclic analogues of ac-RYYRWK-NH2 were prepared but these structures were much less active when compared to ac-RYYRWK-NH2. In vitro receptor autoradiography with [H-3]ac-RYYRWK-NH2 to rat brain sections revealed high levels of binding in the cerebral cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus and superior colliculus, but low levels in the cerebellum and striatum. Overall, the regional distribution was very similar to that of [H-3]NC. Ac-RYYRWK-NH2 seems indeed to be selective for the NC receptor and [H-3]ac-RYYRWK-NH2 is a novel radioligand which may be useful for further exploring the pharmacology and receptor-ligand interaction of the NC receptor.

We aimed to estimate the absorbed doses for normal organs and tumor lesions using Lu-177-PSMA I&T (I&T is imaging and therapy) in patients undergoing up to 4 cycles of radioligand therapy. Results were compared with pretherapeutic Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys-(Ahx)[Ga-68(HBEDCC)] (68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC) PET. Methods: A total of 34 cycles in 18 patients were analyzed retrospectively. In 15 patients the first, in 9 the second, in 5 the third, and in 5 the fourth cycle was analyzed, respectively. Whole-body scintigraphy was performed at least between 30-120 min, 24 h, and 6-8 d after administration. Regions of interest covering the whole body, organs, and up to 4 tumor lesions were drawn. Organ and tumor masses were derived from pretherapeutic Ga-68-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT. Absorbed doses for individual cycles were calculated using OLINDA/EXM. SUVs from pretherapeutic PET were compared with absorbed doses and with change of SUV. Results: The mean whole-body effective dose for all cycles was 0.06 +/- 0.03 Sv/GBq. The mean absorbed organ doses were 0.72 +/- 0.21 Gy/GBq for the kidneys; 0.12 +/- 0.06 Gy/GBq for the liver; and 0.55 +/- 0.14 Gy/GBq for the parotid, 0.64 +/- 0.40 Gy/ GBq for the submandibular, and 3.8 +/- 1.4 Gy/GBq for the lacrimal glands. Absorbed organ doses were relatively constant among the 4 different cycles. Tumor lesions received a mean absorbed dose per cycle of 3.2 +/- 2.6 Gy/GBq (range, 0.22-12 Gy/GBq). Doses to tumor lesions gradually decreased, with 3.5 +/- 2.9 Gy/GBq for the first, 3.3 +/- 2.5 Gy/GBq for the second, 2.7 +/- 2.3 Gy/GBq for the third, and 2.4 +/- 2.2 Gy/GBq for the fourth cycle. SUVs of pretherapeutic PET moderately correlated with absorbed dose (r 5 0.44, P, 0.001 for SUVmax; r 5 0.43, P < 0.001 for SUVmean) and moderately correlated with the change of SUV (r 5 0.478, P < 0.001 for SUVmax, and r 5 0.50, P < 0.001 for SUVmean). Conclusion: Organ-and tumor-absorbed doses for 177Lu-PSMA I& T are comparable to recent reports and complement these with information on an excellent correlation between the 4 therapy cycles. With the kidneys representing the critical organ, a cumulative activity of 40 GBq of 177Lu-PSMA I& T appears to be safe and justifiable. The correlation between pretherapeutic SUV and absorbed tumor dose emphasizes the need for PSMA-ligand PET imaging for patient selection.

However, scarce literature is reported on the long-term outcome of these patients. The current goal of this study is focused on the long-term outcome of mCRPC patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT. Methods Among 135 patients, 121 mCRPC patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. Patients received a median of 3 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT at 6 to 12-week intervals. Primary endpoint included overall survival (OS) and secondary endpoints involved progression-free survival (PFS), predictive factors of OS and PFS, PSA response rate, molecular response, clinical response, and toxicity assessment. Results The median administered cumulative activity was 20 GBq (3.7-37 GBq). The median follow-up duration was 36 months (6-72 months). The estimated median PFS and OS were 12 months (mo) (95% CI: 10.3-13 mo) and 16 mo (95% CI: 13-17 mo), respectively. Any PSA decline and PSA decline >50% was achieved in 73% and 61% of the patients, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed only failure to achieve >50% PSA decline as a significant factor associated with a poor PFS. Prognostic factors associated with reduced OS included, failure to experience >50% PSA decline, heavily pre-treated patient cohort who received >2 lines of prior treatment options, and patient sub-group treated with >= 2 lines of chemotherapy. Patients re-treated with additional treatment options after attaining Lu-177-PSMA refractory disease showed a remarkably prolonged OS. A significant clinical benefit was achieved post Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT. The most common toxicities observed were fatigue (34.7%), followed by nausea (33%), and dry mouth (24.7%). Conclusion The current study supports the short-term safety and efficacy results of high response rates, prolonged PFS and OS, improved quality of life, and low treatment-related toxicities in patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy.

Synthesis and Preliminary Biological Assessment of Carborane-Loaded Theranostic Nanoparticles to Target Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen	ACS APPLIED MATERIALS & INTERFACES			English	Article						prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA); boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT); nanoparticles; amphiphilic block copolymer; positron emission tomography (PET) imaging	BORON NEUTRON-CAPTURE; LU-177-PSMA-617 RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; SILICA NANOPARTICLES; GERMAN MULTICENTER; CANCER; PSMA; TUMOR; DELIVERY; PET; INHIBITORS	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is an encouraging therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. Prostatespecific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a cell membrane protein that is abundantly overexpressed in prostate cancer and can be targeted with radioligand therapies to stimulate clinical responses in patients. In principle, a spatially targeted neutron beam together with specifically targeted PSMA ligands could enable prostate cancer-targeted BNCT. Thus, we developed and tested PSMAtargeted poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-b-PEG) nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with carborane and tethered to the radiometal chelator deferoxamine B (DFB) for simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and selective delivery of boron to prostate cancer. Monomeric PLGA-b-PEGs were covalently functionalized with either DFB or the PSMA ligand ACUPA. Different nanoparticle formulations were generated by nanoemulsification of the corresponding unmodified and DFB- or ACUPA-modified monomers in varying percent fractions. The nanoparticles were efficiently labeled with Zr-89 and were subjected to in vitro and in vivo evaluation. The optimized DFB(25)ACUPA(75) NPs exhibited strong in vitro binding to PSMA in direct binding and competition radioligand binding assays in PSMA(+) PC3-Pip cells. [Zr-89]DFB(25) NPs and [Zr-89]DFB(25)-ACUPA(75) NPs were injected to mice with bilateral PSMA(-) PC3-Flu and PSMA(+) PC3-Pip dual xenografts. The NPs demonstrated twofold superior accumulation in PC3-Pip tumors to that of PC3-Flu tumors with a tumor/blood ratio of 25; however, no substantial effect of the ACUPA ligands was detected. Moreover, fast release of carborane from the NPs was observed, resulting in a low boron delivery to tumors in vivo. In summary, these data demonstrate the synthesis, characterization, and initial biological assessment of PSMA-targeted, carborane-loaded PLGA-b-PEG nanoparticles and establish the foundation for future efforts to enable their best use in vivo.

In a search for novel agonist radioligands and imaging ligands for the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor, [H-3]AZ11637326 was synthesized and its in vitro membrane binding properties were characterized. [H-3]AZ11637326 bound to h alpha 7-HEK membranes with high specificity (>95%), high affinity (230 pM) and a B-max of 460 fmol/mg. The rank order of affinity of nicotinic standards determined with [H-3]AZ11637326 strongly correlated with those determined using the classical alpha 7 antagonist [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin, indicating that [H-3]AZ11637326 bound to h alpha 7-HEK membranes with an alpha 7 nicotinic-like pharmacology. The K-i values for the standards were on average 2.3-fold lower affinity than determined using the prototypical alpha 7 nicotinic antagonist [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. Because [H-3]AZ11637326 specific binding is rapid and reversible, the K-i values determined using this ligand are more accurate estimates of affinity than those determined using the kinetically sluggish [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. [H-3] AZ11637326 also bound to a high affinity (510 pM), nicotine-sensitive site on rat hippocampal membranes with an average B-max of 55 fmol/mg. With rat hippocampal membranes, the nicotine-sensitive fraction of total binding was sub-optimal for a radioligand (similar to 50%), yet the potencies and rank order of the K-i, values for standards were consistent with an alpha 7 nicotinic pharmacology. Overall, these studies indicate that [H-3] AZ11637326 is a useful new in vitro probe of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor agonist site and support its potential utility for in vivo receptor occupancy studies.

Test-retest repeatability of organ uptake on PSMA-targeted <SUP>18</SUP>F-DCFPyL PET/CT in patients with prostate cancer	PROSTATE			English	Article						F-18-DCFPyL; E-PSMA; organ uptake; PROMISE; prostate cancer; PSMA-PET; CT; radioligand therapy; theranostics		ObjectivesWe evaluated F-18-DCFPyL test-retest repeatability of uptake in normal organs. MethodsTwenty-two prostate cancer (PC) patients underwent two F-18-DCFPyL PET scans within 7 days within a prospective clinical trial (NCT03793543). In both PET scans, uptake in normal organs (kidneys, spleen, liver, and salivary and lacrimal glands) was quantified. Repeatability was determined by using within-subject coefficient of variation (wCOV), with lower values indicating improved repeatability. ResultsFor SUVmean, repeatability was high for kidneys, spleen, liver, and parotid glands (wCOV, range: 9.0%-14.3%) and lower for lacrimal (23.9%) and submandibular glands (12.4%). For SUVmax, however, the lacrimal (14.4%) and submandibular glands (6.9%) achieved higher repeatability, while for large organs (kidneys, liver, spleen, and parotid glands), repeatability was low (range: 14.1%-45.2%). ConclusionWe found acceptable repeatability of uptake on F-18-DCFPyL PET for normal organs, in particular for SUVmean in the liver or parotid glands. This may have implications for both PSMA-targeted imaging and treatment, as patient selection for radioligand therapy and standardized frameworks for scan interpretation (PROMISE, E-PSMA) rely on uptake in those reference organs.

Positron emission tomography imaging with the TSPO radioligand C-11-PBR28 was performed at baseline and after a median follow-up of 2.7 years in 14 amyloid-positive patients and 8 amyloid-negative controls. Patients had a greater increase in TSPO binding than controls in inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, occipital cortex, hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and combined middle and inferior temporal cortex. TSPO binding in temporoparietal regions increased from 3.9% to 6.3% per annum in patients, but ranged from -0.5% to 1% per annum in controls. The change in TSPO binding correlated with cognitive worsening on clinical dementia rating scale-sum of boxes and reduced cortical volume. The annual rate of increased TSPO binding in temporoparietal regions was about 5-fold higher in patients with clinical progression (n = 9) compared with those who did not progress (n = 5). TSPO may serve as a biomarker of Alzheimer's progression and response to anti-inflammatory therapies. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Development of <i>N</i>-Methyl-(2-arylquinolin-4-yl)oxypropanamides as Leads to PET Radioligands for Translocator Protein (18 kDa)	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BENZODIAZEPINE BINDING-SITES; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS PATIENTS; IN-VIVO; HUMAN-BRAIN; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; HEALTHY HUMANS; RECEPTOR; NEUROINFLAMMATION	Translocator protein (18 kDa), known as TSPO, is a recognized biomarker of neuroinflammation. Radioligands with PET accurately quantify TSPO in neuroinflammatory conditions. However, the existence of three human TSPO genotypes that show differential affinity to almost all useful TSPO PET radioligands hampers such studies. There is an unmet need for genotype-insensitive, high-affinity, and moderately lipophilic TSPO ligands that may serve as leads for PET radioligand development. To address this need, we varied the known high-affinity TSPO ligand (l)-N,N-diethyl-2-methyl-3-(2-phenylquinolin-4-yl)propanamide in its aryl scaffold, side chain tether, and pendant substituted amido group while retaining an N-methyl group as a site for labeling with carbon-11. From this effort, oxygen-tethered N-methyl-aryloxypropanamides emerged as new high-affinity TSPO ligands with attenuated lipophilicity, including one example with attractive properties for PET radioligand development, namely N-methyl-N-phenyl-2-{[2-(pyridin-2-yl)quinolin-4-yl]oxy}propanamide (22a; rat K-i = 0.10 nM; human TSPO genotypes K-i = 1.4 nM; clogD = 4.18).

Its expression pattern, together with postulated involvement in a wide variety of immunological and inflammatory processes make histamine H-4 receptor an interesting target for drug development. Potential H4R ligands may provide an innovative therapies for different immuno-based diseases, including allergy, asthma, pruritus associated with allergy or autoimmune skin conditions, rheumatoid arthritis and pain. However, none of successfully developed selective and potent histamine H-4 receptor ligands have been introduced to the market up to date. For that reason there is still a strong demand for pharmacological models to be used in studies on potent H4R ligands. In current work we present the development of novel mammalian cell line, stably expressing human histamine H-4 receptor, with use of retroviral transduction approach. Obtained cell line was pharmacologically characterized in radioligand binding studies and its utility for affinity testing of potent receptor ligands was confirmed in comparative studies with the use of relevant insect cells expression model. Obtained results allow for statement that developed cellular model may be successfully employed in search for new compounds active at histamine H-4 receptor.

Radiosynthesis and Evaluation of 5-[<SUP>125</SUP>I]Iodoindol-3-yl-β-D-Galactopyranoside as a β-Galactosidase Imaging Radioligand	MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article							TRANSFER-CATALYZED SYNTHESIS; GENE-EXPRESSION; REPORTER; LACZ	The synthesis and investigation of 5-[(125)I]iodoindol-3-yl-beta-D-galactopyranoside ([(125)I]IBDG) as a radioligand for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of P-galactosidase expression are described. No-carrier-added [(125)I]IBDG was synthesized by a radioiododestannylation approach in > 75% overall radiochemical yield and > 99% radiochemical purity. [(125)I]IBDG was evaluated as a substrate using beta-galactosidase-expressing (D54L) and nonexpressing (D54) human glioma cell lines. A 24-hour incubation of this substrate with cultured cells revealed a 6.5-fold greater intracellular trapping of radioactivity in D54L cells compared with D54 cells. Systemic delivery of [(125)I]IBDG in nude mice bearing D54L tumors failed to show significant trapping of radioactivity within these tumors by SPECT imaging. In contrast, intratumoral injection of the substrate resulted in efficient trapping of radioactivity in D54L tumors but not D54 tumors, resulting in clear SPECT visualization of the former tumor. Based on dynamic SPECT imaging and blood metabolite analysis, we conclude that although [(125)I]IBDG is an efficient in vivo substrate for P-galactosidase, its rapid renal clearance hampers its intratumoral availability on systemic administration.

An efficient purification of the crude product has also been developed and was accomplished by C-18 reversed-phase semi-preparative HPLC using 55/45 EtOH-NaH2PO4 buffer (20mM, pH = 6.5) as the eluent. The desired product fraction was collected in a 2.0-2.5 mL volume and formulated with 11 mL of 0.9% saline. The radioligand was ready for human use in 45 min (EOB). The product was obtained with a radiochemical yield of 11.1 +/- 1.8% (EOB, n = 15) with a radiochemical purity of > 99%. Specific activity was 133.2-185.0 GBq/mu mol (3.6-5.0 Ci/mu mol, EOS, n = 2) when ca. 37.0 GBq (ca. 1.0 Ci) of starting [C-11]CO2 was used. Unlabeled mass of [C-11]DWAY was found to be 0.15-0.24 mu g/mL and the precursor was present in less than 50 ng/mL in final production solution. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The;synthesis was accomplished using a general solution-phase synthetic procedure which allows for introduction of affinity labeling groups late in the synthesis of a variety of small peptide substrates. The target peptides and their corresponding amines were then evaluated in radioligand binding experiments using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing delta- and mu -opioid receptors. The peptides [Phe-(P-NCS)(3)]TIPP (2) and [Phe(p-NCS)(4)]TIPP (4) showed affinity for delta -receptors comparable to the parent compound TIPP (IC50 = 12 and 5 nM, respectively, vs 6 nM for TIPP). Both peptides 2 and 4 were able to inhibit radioligand binding to d-receptors in a wash-resistant manner at a concentration of 10 nM. Therefore, the peptides [Phe(p-NCS)(3)]TIPP (2) and [Phe(p-NCS)(4)]-TIPP (4) represent two affinity labels that may prove useful in the study of delta -opioid receptors.

Pharmacological characterization of the [H-3]astemizole binding assay for HERG K+ channels was performed using HERG-expressing HEK293 cells. The assay conditions employed yielded 90% specific binding using 10 mug/well of membrane protein with 1.5 nM of [H-3]astemizole at 25degreesC. The K-d and B-max values were 5.91 +/- 0.81 nM and 6.36 +/- 0.26 pmol/mg, respectively. The intraassay and interassay variations were 11.4% and 14.9%, respectively. Binding affinities for 32 reference compounds (including dofetilide, cisapride, and terfenadine) with diverse structures demonstrated a similar potency rank order for HERG inhibition to that reported in the literature. Moreover, the [H-3]astemizole binding data demonstrated a rank order of affinity that was highly correlated to that of inhibitory potency in the electrophysiological studies for HERG in HEK293 (r(SP) = 0.91, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the [H-3]astemizole binding assay is rapid and capable of detecting HERG inhibitors.

Identification and regional distribution in rat brain of radiometabolites of the dopamine transporter PET radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PE2I	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						dopamine transporter; brain; PET; [C-11]PE2I; metabolites	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE; ALCOHOL-DEHYDROGENASE; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HIGH-AFFINITY; BETA-CIT; IN-VIVO; BINDING; METABOLISM	Purpose We aimed to determine the composition of radioactivity in rat brain after intravenous administration of the dopamine transporter radioligand, [C-11]PE2I. Methods PET time-activity curves (TACs) and regional brain distribution ex vivo were measured using no-carrier-added [C-11]PE2I. Carrier-added [C-11]PE2I was administered to identify metabolites with high-performance liquid radiochromatography (RC) or RC with mass spectrometry (LC-MS and MS-MS). The stability of [C-11]PE2I was assessed in rat brain homogenates. Results After peak brain uptake of no-carrier-added [C-11]PE2I, there was differential washout rate from striata and cerebellum. Thirty minutes after injection, [C-11]PE2I represented 10.9 +/- 2.9% of the radioactivity in plasma, 67.1 +/- 11.0% in cerebellum, and 92.5 +/- 3.2% in striata, and was accompanied by two less lipophilic radiometabolites. [C-11]PE2I was stable in rat brain homogenate for at least 1 h at 37 degrees C. LC-MS identified hydroxylated PE2I (1) (m/z 442) and carboxyl-desmethyl-PE2I (2) (m/z 456) in brain. MS-MS of 1 gave an m/z 442 -> 424 transition due to H2O elimination, so verifying the presence of a benzyl alcohol group. Metabolite 2 was the benzoic acid derivative. Ratios of ex vivo measurements of [C-11]PE2I, [C-11]1, and [C-11]2 in striata to their cognates in cerebellum were 6.1 +/- 3.4, 3.7 +/- 2.2 and 1.33 +/- 0.38, respectively, showing binding selectivity of metabolite [C-11]1 to striata. Conclusion Radiometabolites [C-11]1 and [C-11]2 were characterized as the 4-hydroxymethyl and 4-carboxyl analogs of [C-11]PE2I, respectively. The presence of the pharmacologically active [C-11]1 and the inactive [C-11]2 is a serious impediment to successful biomathematical analysis.

TASP0434299 exhibited high binding affinities for human and rat V-1B receptors with IC50 values of 0.526 and 0.641 nM, respectively, and potent antagonistic activity at the human V-1B receptor with an IC50 value of 0.639 nM without apparent binding affinities for other molecules at 1 mM. [H-3] TASP0434299 bound to membranes expressing the human V-1B receptor as well as those prepared from the rat anterior pituitary in a saturable manner. The binding of [H-3] TASP0434299 to the membranes was dose-dependently displaced by several ligands for the V-1B receptor. In addition, the intravenous administration of [H-3] TASP0434299 to rats produced a saturable radioactive accumulation in the anterior pituitary where the V-1B receptor is enriched, and it was dosedependently blocked by the oral administration of 2-[2-(3-chloro-4fluorophenyl)- 6-[3-(morpholin-4-yl) propoxy]-4-oxopyrido[2,3-d] pyrimidin-3(4H)-yl]-N-isopropylacetamide hydrochloride, a V-1B receptor antagonist, indicating that [H-3] TASP0434299 can be used as an in vivo radiotracer to measure the occupancy of the V-1B receptor. Finally, the intravenous administration of [C-11] TASP0434299 provided positron emission tomographic images of the V-1B receptor in the pituitary in an anesthetized monkey, and the signal was blocked by pretreatment with an excess of unlabeled TASP0434299. These results indicate that radiolabeled TASP0434299 is the first radioligand to be capable of quantifying the V-1B receptor selectively in both in vitro and in vivo studies and will provide a clinical biomarker for determining the occupancy of the V-1B receptor during drug development or for monitoring the levels of the V-1B receptor in diseased conditions.

The purpose of the present study is to develop a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for H(3)Rs from dihydroquinolinone derivatives, which we previously found to have high affinity with these receptors. Methods: Six compounds were selected from a dihydroquinolinone compound library based on structural capability for C-11 labeling and binding affinity for H(3)Rs. Their in vivo kinetics in the rat brain were examined in a comparative manner by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Chemicals with appropriate kinetic properties were then labeled with C-11 and evaluated in rats and monkeys using PET. Results: Of the six compounds, TASP0410457 (also diminutively called TASP457) and TASP0434988 exhibited fast kinetics and relatively high brain uptakes in ex vivo LC-MS/MS and were selected as candidate PET imaging agents. PET data in rat brains were mostly consistent with LC-MS/MS findings, and rat and monkey PET scans demonstrated that [C-11]TASP0410457 was superior to [C-11]TASP0434988 for high-contrast H3R PET imaging. In the monkey brain PET, distribution volume for [C-11]TASP0410457 could be quantified, and receptor occupancy by a nonradioactive compound was measurable using this radioligand. The specific binding of [C-11]TASP0410457 to H(3)Rs was confirmed by autoradiography using rat and monkey brain sections. Conclusions: We developed [11C]TASP0410457 as a radioligand enabling a robust quantification of H(3)Rs in all brain regions and demonstrated the utility of ex vivo LC-MS/MS and in vivo PET assays for selecting appropriate imaging tracers. [C-11]TASP0410457 will help to examine the implication of H(3)Rs in neuropsychiatric disorders and to characterize emerging therapeutic agents targeting H(3)Rs.

Protein profiling in the habenula after chronic (-)-menthol exposure in mice	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						addiction; immunoblotting; mass spectrometry; menthol; nicotine; radioligand binding	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; DECOY SEARCH STRATEGY; UP-REGULATION; MENTHOL; WITHDRAWAL; PHOSPHORYLATION; INHIBITION; ABUNDANCE; CIRCUITRY; NEURONS	The identification of proteins that are altered following nicotine/tobacco exposure can facilitate and positively impact the investigation of related diseases. In this report, we investigated the effects of chronic (-)-menthol exposure in 14 murine brain regions for changes in total beta 2 subunit protein levels and changes in epibatidine binding levels using immunoblotting and radioligand binding assays. We identified the habenula as a region of interest due to the region's marked decreases in beta 2 subunit and nAChR levels in response to chronic (-)-menthol alone. Thus, we further examined the habenula, a brain region associated with both the reward and withdrawal components of addiction, for additional protein level alterations using mass spectrometry. A total of 552 proteins with altered levels were identified after chronic (-)-menthol exposure. Enriched in the proteins with altered levels after (-)-menthol exposure were proteins associated with signaling, immune systems, RNA regulation, and protein transport. The continuation and expansion of the brain region-specific protein profiling in response to (-)-menthol will provide a better understanding of how this common flavorant in tobacco and e-liquid products may affect addiction and general health.

MIP design was based upon a combination of experimental (H-1 NMR) and computational (molecular dynamics) methods, Two MIPs and corresponding nonimprinted reference polymers were synthesized and characterized (scanning electron microscopy; nitrogen sorption; and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). MIP-ligand recognition was examined using radioligand binding studies, where the largest number of selective sites was found in a warfarin-imprinted methacrylic acid ethylene dimethacrylate copolymer (MAA-MIP). The warfarin selectivity of this MIP was confirmed using radioligand displacement and zonal chromatographic studies. A direct comparison of MIP-warfarin binding characteristics with those of the HSA Sudlow I binding site was made, and similarities in site population (per gram polymer or protein) and affinities were observed. The warfarin selectivity of the MIP suggests its potential for use as a recognition element in a MIP-based warfarin sensor and even as a model to aid in understanding and steering blood-plasma protein-regulated transport processes or even for the development of warfarin sensors.

Methods: Six subjects (5 men and 1 woman; age range, 51-74 y) underwent dynamic whole-body PET/CT for 6 h after a bolus injection of F-18-GE067. Source organs were delineated on PET/CT. Individual organ doses and effective doses were determined. Results: No adverse events or clinically significant changes were observed. F-18-GE067 is excreted predominantly through the hepatobiliary system. The gallbladder, upper large intestine, and small intestine are the organs with the highest absorbed dose (average, 287, 173, and 155 mu Gy/MBq, respectively). The mean effective dose was 33.8 +/- 3.4 mu Sv/MBq, a dose comparable to that of many other F-18-labeled radiopharmaceuticals. Conclusion: The estimated effective dose of F-18-GE067 for PET amyloid imaging was acceptable (class II-b defined by the World Health Organization), and relatively low variability between subjects was observed.

Novel 2- and 4-Substituted 1<i>H</i>-Imidazo[4,5-<i>c</i>]quinolin-4-amine Derivatives as Allosteric Modulators of the A<sub>3</sub> Adenosine Receptor	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AGONISTS; BINDING; ENHANCEMENT; RADIOLIGAND; TARGET; SERIES	4-Arylamino and 2-cycloalkyl (including amino substitution) modifications were made in a series of 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine derivatives as allosteric modulators of the human A3 adenosine receptor (AR). In addition to allosteric modulation of the maximum functional efficacy (in [S-35]GTP gamma S G protein binding assay) of the A(3)AR agonist C1-IB-MECA (15), some analogues also weakly inhibited equilibrium radioligand binding at ARs. 4-(3,5-Dichlorophenylamino) (6) or 2-(1-adamantyl) (20) substitution produced allosteric enhancement (twice the maximal agonist efficacy), with minimal inhibition of orthosteric AR binding. 2-(4-Tetrahydropyranyl) substitution abolished allosteric enhancement but preserved inhibition of orthosteric binding. Introduction of nitrogen in the six-membered ring at the 2 position, to improve aqueous solubility and provide a derivatization site, greatly reduced the allosteric enhancement. 2-(4-(Benzoylamino)cyclohexyl) analogues 23 and 24 were weak negative A3AR modulators. Thus, consistent with previous findings, the allosteric and orthosteric inhibitory A3AR effects in imidazoquinolines are structurally separable, suggesting the possible design of additional derivatives with enhanced positive or negative allosteric A3AR activity and improved selectivity in comparison to inhibition of orthosteric binding.

Adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors were studied in post-mortem human cortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and age-matched controls. Total adenosine A(1) receptor number, determined by radioligand binding assay, using [H-3]DPCPX, was significantly increased in AD cases in early and advanced stages without differences with the progression of the disease. A significant increase of A(1)R (37 kDa) levels was also observed by Western blot in early and advanced stages of AD. In addition, increased numbers of adenosine A(2A) receptors were observed in AD samples as determined by a binding assay using [H-3]ZM 241385 as a radioligand and by Western blot. Increased binding and protein expression levels of adenosine receptors were not associated with increased mRNA levels coding A(1) and A(2A) receptors. Finally, increased A(1) and A(2A) receptor-mediated response was observed. These results show up-regulation of adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors in frontal cortex in AD, associated with sensitization of the corresponding transduction pathways.

Vanilloid (subtype 1) receptor-modulatory drugs inhibit [<SUP>3</SUP>H]Batrachotoxinin-A 20-α-benzoate binding to Na<SUP>+</SUP> channels	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							DEPENDENT SODIUM-CHANNELS; CAPSAICIN; BATRACHOTOXININ; ANANDAMIDE; CURRENTS	This investigation was conducted to provide further insight into the effects of vanilloid (subtype 1) receptor (VR1) drugs at voltage-gated sodium channels and examine the potential of this interaction to influence release of neurotransmitters from synaptosomes prepared from mammalian brain. The VR1 modulatory drugs capsaicin, olvanil and capsazepine inhibited the binding of batrachotoxinin-A 20-alpha-benzoate ([H-3]BTX-B) to receptor site 2 of voltage-gated sodium channels. All drugs reduced the affinity of radioligand for sodium channels, and capsazepine also decreased the number of [H-3]BTX-B binding sites. In kinetic experiments, no reduction in radioligand association rate was found, but capsaicin, olvanil and capsazepine all enhanced the dissociation rate of [H-3]BTX-B. All drugs inhibited veratridine-evoked release of L-glutamic acid, gamma-amino butyric acid and L-aspartic acid from synaptosomes; however, their inhibitory effects on transmitter release were much weaker when 35 mM potassium chloride was used to depolarize synaptosomes. The study compounds, in common with other central nervous system depressants, interact with a region on the voltage-gated sodium channel that permits negative allosteric coupling with receptor site 2 and this mechanism likely accounts for blockade of sodium channel-activated transmitter release.

Prognostic implications of dual tracer PET/CT: PSMA ligand and [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FDG PET/CT in patients undergoing [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]PSMA radioligand therapy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						PSMA; FDG; PET; CT; Prostate cancer; Radioligand therapy	MITOXANTRONE PLUS PREDNISONE; METASTATIC PROSTATE-CANCER; SURVIVAL	Background Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-labeled PSMA ligands has achieved remarkable results in advanced disease stages of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, not all patients benefit from this therapy. Different treatment responses could be explained by tumor heterogeneity triggered by progression and the number of prior treatments. PSMA-negative lesions can be missed on PSMA ligand PET/CT, which subsequently results in an underestimation of tumor burden. Conversely, high FDG uptake may also be an indicator of tumor aggressiveness and thus a poor prognostic marker for response to RLT and overall survival (OS). The aim of this analysis was to investigate the prognostic value of combined PSMA ligand PET/CT and [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT for outcome prediction in patients undergoing RLT. Materials and methods This bicentric analysis included 54 patients with mCRPC who underwent both FDG and PSMA ligand PET/CT imaging before RLT. In all patients, the pattern of PSMA ligand and FDG uptake was visually assessed. Patients with at least one FDG-positive, but PSMA-negative (FDG+/PSMA-) lesions were compared to patients without any FDG+/PSMA- lesions. A log-rank analysis was used to assess the difference in OS between subgroups. Results Median OS was 11 +/- 1.8 months (95% CI 7.4-14.6). A significantly lower OS (p < 0.001) was found in patients with at least one FDG+/PSMA- lesion at baseline PET/CTs (n = 18) with a median OS of 6.0 +/- 0.5 months (95% CI: 5.0-7.0 months). In comparison, patients without any FDG+/PSMA- lesions (n = 36) had a median OS of 16.0 +/- 2.5 months (95% CI: 11.2-20.8 months). Conclusion FDG+/PSMA- lesions are a negative predictor of overall survival in patients with mCRPC undergoing RLT. However, it remains to be determined if patients with FDG+/PSMA- lesions should be excluded from PSMA RLT.

Compound 1 was found to possess nanomolar affinity (K-i(sigma(1)) = 2.57 nM) for the sigma(2) receptor, high subtype selectivity (>2000-fold), and high selectivity over 40 other receptors and transporters. Radioligand [F-18]1 was prepared with radiochemical yield of 37-54%, > 99% radiochemical purity, and molar activity of 107-189 GBq/mu mol. Biodistribution and blocking studies in mice and micro-PET/CT imaging of [F-18]1 in rats indicated excellent binding specificity to the sigma(2) receptors in vivo. Micro-PET/CT imaging of [F-18]1 in the U87MG glioma xenograft model demonstrated clear tumor visualization with high tumor uptake and tumor-to-background ratio. Co-injection with CM398 (5 mu mol/kg) led to a remarkable reduction of tumor uptake (80%, 60-70 min), indicating high specific binding of [F-18]1 in U87MG glioma xenografts.

Neuroreceptor Profile and Behavior of CD-1 Mice Subpopulations with Different Attention Stability	NEUROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						attention deficit disorder; closed enriched plus maze; radioligand binding; NMDA-receptor; GABA(B)-receptor; D2-receptor; exploratory behavior; anxiety; locomotor activity	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; GABA; BINDING; ADHD; ANXIETY; LIGAND; TESTS; MAZE	We used the radioligand binding method to study the neuroreceptor profile in the brain structures of subpopulations of outbred CD-1 mice that differ in stability of attention to environmental objects in the enriched closed plus maze test. In the prefrontal cortex of the subpopulation of mice with low attention to new objects, the density (B-max, fmol/mg of protein) of D2-dopamine receptors was 25% higher whereas the density of GABA(B)-receptors was 34% lower compared to the mice with normal attention. We did not find any significant differences in the K-d and B-max indices in the binding with NMDA-receptors in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex between the subpopulations of mice. We additionally examined mouse behavior in the enriched closed plus maze and elevated plus maze tests using correlation and factor analysis. The index of attention to objects of the enriched closed plus maze correlated and had significant factor load with the indices of exploratory activity, such as time in center and amount of rearing in the elevated plus maze but did not correlate with anxiety indices.

However, they are also present in extrastriatal structures. A(2A)R were studied in post-mortem human frontal cortex from Pick's disease (PiD) and age-matched non-demented controls by radioligand binding assays, Western-blotting, real-time PCR and adenylyl cyclase activity determination. Saturation binding assay using [H-3]ZM 241385, a selective A(2A) antagonist, as radioligand revealed a significant increase in total adenosine A(2A)R numbers (B-max) in frontal cortex from PiD samples (191% of control B-max), suggesting up-regulation of this receptor. A significant increase in the level of A(2A)R was also detected by Western-blotting. Furthermore, expression of mRNA coding A(2A)R determined by quantitative real-time PCR was enhanced. In agreement, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by CGS 21680, a selective A(2A) receptor agonist, was significantly strengthened. Up-regulation of A(2B) receptors and their corresponding mRNA was also observed. These results show that A(2A) adenosine receptor/adenylyl cyclase transduction pathway is up-regulated and sensitized in frontal cortex brain from PiD.

Frozen sections of tissue from six different levels in the bronchial tree, from the trachea to the distal bronchioles, were incubated in vitro with 1.5 nmol/L of the muscarinic receptor antagonist 1-[N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride (H-3-NMS). In addition, the subtype pattern of muscarinic receptors was investigated in equine tracheal smooth muscle using radioligand binding with methoctramine, tripinamide, 4-DAMP-methiodide and pirenzipine as competitors against the binding of 1.3 nmol/L H-3-NMS. The autoradiograms showed specific labelling indicating a high density of muscarinic receptors in smooth-muscle tissue in all levels of the airway tree investigated. Besides muscle tissue, subepithelial glands were the only structures specifically labelled. The dominating subtypes in tracheal smooth muscle investigated with radioligand binding studies were found to be M-2 and M-4, as both methoctramine (pK(d) = 8.5) and tripinamide (pK(d) = 8.6 and 6.7 for two different sites) showed high affinity. The density of the M-3-muscarinic receptor subtype was low, but this subtype could be detected with statistical significance when methoctramine was used as the competitor against H-3-NMS binding.

Radioligand Therapy of Patients with Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer	BIOLOGY BULLETIN			English	Article						radioligand therapy; radionuclides; metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; prostate specific membrane antigen	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; INCREASED SURVIVAL; BONE METASTASES; J591; LU-177-PSMA-617; RADIONUCLIDES; MITOXANTRONE; CABAZITAXEL; RADIUM-223	Prostate cancer is a serious social and medical problem all over the world. It ranks fifth in the total structure of cancer morbidity and second in the structure of morbidity and mortality of men with neoplasms and takes the lead in growth rates. Androgen-deprivation therapy is insufficiently effective for the treatment of patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This makes it relevant to develop novel methods for treating patients with this disease. Radioligand therapy (RLT) for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer using low molecular ligands with high affinity to prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) labeled with beta- and alpha-emitting isotopes is currently under rapid development. One of the most promising radionuclide medicines is the Lu-177-PSMA-617 radiopharmaceutical based on the PSMA-617 ligand. The decay of Lu-177 results in the emission of both beta particles and gamma-rays. Therefore, it may also be used for therapy and SPECT diagnostics of malignancies. Lu-177-PSMA-617 is currently at different phases of clinical trials in many countries; however, it has not yet been registered. Most medical centers use the standard activity of 6 or 7.5 GBq per cycle (six or eight weeks between cycles), which causes less than 10% of serious adverse events (mainly hematological ones). Grade 3 anemia and thrombocytopenia develop in about 10% of patients, grade 1-2 dry mouth in 66%, and transient nausea of the 1st or 2nd degree in 48% of patients. The positive effect of RLT has been recorded: pain relief in 33-70% of patients, improvement of life quality in 60%, and an increase in Karnofsky's status in 74%. A biochemical response after RLT has been detected in more than half of the patients; among them, the PSA decreased by more than 50% in 45% of cases; in addition, this was observed after the first course in most cases; according to the data based on imaging methods, a partial response was recorded in more than a third of patients.

Pharmacological competition studies and test-retest experiments have shown high validity and reliability of the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]FLB 457 for D2-R quantification in extrastriatal brain regions. However, this radioligand is not available at most research centers. Instead, the medium affinity radioligand [C-11]raclopride, which has been extensively validated for quantification of D2-R in the high-density region striatum, has been applied also in studies on extrastriatal D2-R. Recently, the validity of this approach has been questioned by observations of low occupancy of [C-11]raclopride in extrastriatal regions in a pharmacological competition study with quetiapine. Here, we utilise a data set of 16 healthy control subjects examined with both [C-11]raclopride and [C-11]FLB 457 to assess the correlation in binding potential (BP ND) in extrastriatal brain regions. BP ND was quantified using the simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region. The rank order of mean regional BP ND values were similar for both radioligands, and corresponded to previously reported data, both post-mortem and using PET. Nevertheless, weak to moderate within-subject correlations were observed between [C-11]raclopride and [C-11]FLB 457 BP ND extrastriatally (Pearson's R: 0.30-0.56), in contrast to very strong correlations between repeated [C-11]FLB 457 measurements (Pearson's R: 0.82-0.98). In comparison, correlations between repeated [C-11]raclopride measurements were low to moderate (Pearson's R: 0.28-0.75). These results are likely related to low signal to noise ratio of [C-11]raclopride in extrastriatal brain regions, and further strengthen the recommendation that extrastriatal D2-R measures obtained with [C-11]raclopride should be interpreted with caution.

One of the most commonly used expression systems for the production of mammalian membrane proteins is the baculovirus expression system in insect cells. However, a detailed analysis by radioligand binding and comparative Western blotting of G protein-coupled receptors and a transporter produced in insect cells showed that a considerable proportion of the expressed protein was misfolded and incapable of ligand binding. In contrast, production of the same membrane proteins in stable inducible mammalian cell lines suggested that the majority was folded correctly. It was noted that detergent solubilisation of the misfolded membrane proteins using either digitonin or dodecylmaltoside was considerably less efficient than using sodium dodecyl sulfate or foscholine-12, whilst these detergents were equally efficient at solubilising correctly folded membrane proteins. This provides a simple and rapid test to suggest whether heterologously expressed mammalian membrane proteins are indeed correctly folded, without requiring radioligand binding assays. This will greatly facilitate the high-throughput production of fully functional membrane proteins for structural studies. (C) 2014 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

KOPr ligands are investigated for their potential roles in the treatment of addiction, depression, feeding behavior, psychosis and schizophrenia. In this study the methanolic extracts of a number of Salvia species which are native to Turkey (S. tomentosa, S. tchihatcheffii, S. rosifolia, S. dichroantha and S. sclarea) were tested for their potential binding to opioid receptors in rat brain membranes and Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells expressing human KOPr (CHO-KOPh). [(3)H] Diprenorphine, an unselective opioid antagonist, was utilized in the radioligand receptor binding assays. All extracts (0.11 mg/mL) inhibited the [(3)H] Diprenorphine binding with ranging KOPr binding affinities. More than 50% inhibition of diprenorphine binding was shown only with Salvia dichroantha and Salvia sclarea both in rat brain membranes and CHO-KOPh membranes. Among them Salvia sclarea deserves further investigation for its active component(s) and its pharmacological characterization. This study clearly demonstrates the potential opioid receptor binding activities of several Turkish Salvia species. This work constitutes the first study on in vitro opioid receptor binding activities of Salvia species from the Turkish flora.

The para-fluoroethoxy-substituted derivatives 3f and 3h revealed an outstanding D(4) subtype selectivity of more than 3 orders of magnitude over both congeners D(2) and D(3) combined with inverse agonism at D(4)R. The corresponding (18)F-labeled radioligands revealed high serum stability in vitro and log P values of 2-3. In vitro rat brain autoradiography showed specific binding of [(18)F]3h in distinct brain regions, including the gyrus dentate of the hippocampus, that were inhibited by both eticlopride (65-80%) and the selective D(4)R antagonist 10 (78-93%). The observed binding pattern was mainly consistent with the known D(4)R distribution in the rat brain. Thus, [(18)F]3h (FAUC F41) represents a potential radioligand for studying the D(4)R in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET).

Labelled with iodine-123 (half-life : 13.1 hours), PE2I has been dedicated to the diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease in humans using single photon emission computed tomography. Labelled with carbon-11 (half-life : 20.4 minutes), it can be used in the absolute quantification of the dopamine transporter (DAT) using the high-resolution, sensitive and non-invasive quantitative imaging technique PET (positron emission tomography). In this paper, the radiosynthesis of carbon-ii labelled PE2I was investigated and oriented towards the preparation of multi milliCuries of radiotracer. Typically, 200 to 300 mCi (7.4-11.1 GBq) of [C-11]PE2I were routinely obtained within 25 minutes of radiosynthesis (including HPLC purification) with specific radioactivities ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 Ci/mu mol (29.6-44.4 GBq/mu mol). Based on the preliminary PET experiments, it can be assumed that this radioligand would permit quantification of the DAT using PET and mathematical compartmental ligand-transporter models.

The PET Radioligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-FIMX Images and Quantifies Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 in Proportion to the Regional Density of Its Gene Transcript in Human Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						mGluRl; F-18-FIMX; PET; gene transcripts	IN-VIVO; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; BINDING; MGLUR1; MONKEY; MODEL; VITRO	A recent study from our laboratory found that F-18-FIMX is an excellent PET radioligand for quantifying metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1) in monkey brain. This study evaluated the ability of F-18-FIMX to quantify mGluR1 in humans. A second goal was to use the relative density of mGluR1 gene transcripts in brain regions to estimate specific uptake and nondisplaceable uptake (V-ND) in each brain region. Methods: After injection of 189 +/- 3 MBq of F-18-FIMX, 12 healthy volunteers underwent a dynamic PET scarf over 120 min: For 6 volunteers, images were acquired until 210 min. A metabolite corrected arterial input function was measured from the radial artery. Four other subjects underwent whole-body scanning to estimate radiation exposure. Results: F-18-FIMX uptake into the human brain was high (SUV = 4-6 in the cerebellum), peaked at about 10 min, and washed out rapidly. An unconstrained 2-tissue-compartment model fitted the data well, and distribution volume (V-T) (mL.cm(-3)) values ranged from 1.5 in the caudate to 11 in the cerebellum. A 120-min scan provided stable VT values in all regions except the cerebellum, for which an acquisition time of at least 170 min was necessary. VT values in brain regions correlated well with mGluR1 transcript density, and the correlation suggested that VND of F-18-FIMX was quite low (0.5 mL.cm(-3)). This measure of VND in humans was similar to that from a receptor blocking study in monkeys, after correcting for differences in plasma protein binding. Similar to other F-18-labeled ligands, the effective dose was about 23 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusion: F-18-FIMX can quantify mGluR1 in the human brain with a 120- to 170-min scan. Correlation of brain uptake with the relative density of mGluR1 transcript allows specific receptor binding of a radioligand to be quantified without injecting pharmacologic doses of a blocking agent.

The QRET system allows receptor-ligand binding assays on intact cells using a single-label approach and a nonspecific quenching mechanism. Binding of antagonists or agonists to the receptor can be defined using a europium(III) labeled ligand. In the presence of the unlabeled ligand the labeled ligand is displaced and remains in solution. The non-bound labeled ligand is not protected by the target receptor, and the luminescence signal is quenched. For this objective, a Eu(III) labeled peptide molecule with three different linkers (AX0, AX1 and AX2) was designed. Peptides were evaluated using the homogeneous QRET technique, radioligand binding assays and the heterogeneous time-resolved luminescence (TRL) technique. Using the Eu-AX0 peptide and the QRET method, a panel of opioid compounds (naltrexone, naltrindole, SCN-80, DPDPE and DAMGO) was tested to prove the assay performance. The signal-to-background ratio for the tested opioid ligand ranged from 3.3 to 12.0. The QRET method showed prominent performance also in high DMSO concentrations. QRET is a homogenous and a non-radioactive detection system for screening and this is the first attempt to utilize peptide ligands in the QRET concept.

Two radioligands were studied in a rat model of cholinergic degeneration to evaluate their potential efficacy for molecular imaging of AD. Following specific cholinergic-cell immunolesioning with 192 IgG-saporin (SAP), ex vivo autoradiography was performed with (IBVM)-I-123, a radioligand which targets the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Following the decay of I-123, the same animals had in vitro autorachography performed with I-125-A-85380, a marker for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). As expected significant, widespread decreases in (BVM)-B-123 uptake were observed in SAP treated animals. Moderate but significant reductions in I-125-A-85380 binding in the hippocampus (Hip) and cerebellum (Cbm) were also observed following SAP immunolesioning. The results with (IBVM)-I-123 confirm and extend previous work investigating the uptake of radioiodinated IBVM in this animal model. The results A with I-125-A-85380 are unique and are in contrast with work performed in this animal model with other nAChR radioligands, indicating the favourable properties of this radioligand for molecular imaging.

The use of high-resolution phosphorimaging has allowed both the affinity (K-d) and density (B-max) of [H-3]flumazenil binding to be measured within regions of the hippocampal formation as well as the cerebellum and frontal cortex. The Scatchard plots of data from all brain regions were linear with Hill coefficients close to unity consistent with the presence of a single binding site for [H-3]flumazenil. The affinities of [H-3]flumazenil binding within all the brain regions were similar (K-d 1.57+/-0.20-3.08+/-0.01 nM), while the density of [H-3]flumazenil binding varied significantly between the brain regions analysed (B-max 182.7+/-7.3-596.7+/-34.0 fmol/mg ETE; P<0.0001). In conclusion, the present results indicate that in situ radioligand binding and high-resolution phosphorimaging techniques can be utilized to measure the distribution, density and affinity of [H-3]flumazenil to the GABA(A) receptor within the human frontal cortex, cerebellum and hippocampal formation.

The precursor for the radiosynthesis 3-hydroxynaphthyl-2-[(N-benzyl)piperidyl]-acetate hydrochloride was prepared by a four-step synthesis starting from ethyl-4-pyridyl acetate. The radiolabelling consisted of methylation with [C-11]methyltriflate in dimethylformamide in the presence of potassium hydroxide. [C-11]SB-235753, was synthesised in 30 min with a radiochemical yield of 10 +/- 5% (EOS, non-decay corrected) with 99% radiochemical purity and specific radioactivity of 10 +/- 3 Ci/mu mol. Biodistribution studies in rats with [C-11]SB-235753 showed the uniform distribution of the tracer within different areas of the murine brain. At 30 min after injection 99% of the radioligand in plasma and 100% in cerebellum was metabolised. These findings-suggest that [C-11]SB-235753 can not be a suitable tracer for dopamine D-4 receptor studies with PET.

Miniaturized receptor binding assays: Complications arising from ligand depletion	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Article						ligand depletion; binding assay; miniaturization; radioligand	DISSOCIATION-CONSTANTS; AFFINITY	The advent of miniaturized assay formats has made possible the screening of large numbers of compounds against a single target, known as high-throughput screening. Despite this clear advantage, assay miniaturization also increases the risk of ligand depletion, where the actual concentration of free ligand is significantly lower than that added. This, in turn, complicates the interpretation of data from such assays, potentially introducing significant error if not recognized. In this study, the effects of reducing assay volume on radioligand Kd and competitor Ki values have been investigated, using the muscarinic M, receptor as a model system. It was found that assay miniaturization caused dramatic effects, with LIP to a 30-fold underestimation of ligand affinity. A theoretical model was developed and shown to accurately predict both the degree of ligand depletion in any given assay volume and the effect of this depletion on affinity estimates for competing ligands. Importantly, it was found that in most cases, errors introduced by ligand depletion could be largely corrected for by the use of appropriate analysis methods. In addition to those previously described by others, the authors propose a simple method capable of correcting errors in competition binding experiments performed in conditions of ligand depletion.

METHODS: Effects of ZNC(C)PR-treated C6 conditioned medium was observed on on culture of PC12 cells. The development of PC12 cells was determined by ratio of neurite-bearing cells in the total cells. The specific binding of ZNC(C)PR on CG cells was determined by radioligand binding assay (RBA). RESULTS: ZNC(C) PR-treated C6 conditioned medium increased the ratio of neurite-bearing PC12 cells by 36 % compared to the untreated C6 conditioned medium or to a mixture of ZNC (C)PR with the untreated C6 conditioned medium. RBA showed a specific binding site of ZNC(C)PR on CG cells with K-d value of 2.74 nmol.L-1 and B-max value of 19 pmol.g(-1) protein. CONCLUSION: ZNC(C)PR enhanced C6 cells induced secretion of some neurotrophic factors which acted as enhancers for PC12 cells differentiation, through its specific receptor sites on the neuroglioma cell.

The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of SRIF receptors msst(1), msst(2), mast(3), msst(4) and msst(5) was studied in the adult mouse brain by in situ hybridisation histochemistry using specific oligonucleotide probes and compared to that of adult rats. As observed in rat brain, sst(3) receptor mRNA is prominently expressed across the mouse brain, although equivalent binding has not yet been identified in situ. Sst(1) and sst(2) receptor mRNA expression, was prominent and again comparable to that observed in rat brain, whereas sst(4) and especially sst(5) receptor mRNA show comparatively low levels, although the former appears to be widely distributed while the latter could only be identified in a few nuclei. Altogether, the data are compatible with current knowledge, i.e. sst(1) and sst(2) receptor mRNA is prominent (both receptors have been functionally identified in the brain and for sat, in the periphery), sst, mRNA is highly expressed but in the absence of any functional correlate remains elusive. The expression of sst(4) mRNA is comparatively low (especially when compared to what is seen in the lung, where high densities of sat, receptors are present) and it remains to be seen whether sst, receptor mRNA, which is confined to a few nuclei, will play a role in the brain, keeping in mind that high levels are found in the pituitary. Radioligand binding studies were performed in CCL39 cells expressing the five human recombinant receptors and compared to binding in membranes of rat cerebral cortex with [I-125]Tyr(11)-SRIF14 which in the presence of 120 mM labels primarily sst(1) receptor as suggested by the better correlation hsst(1) and similar rank order of potency. The profile of [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide labelled sites in rat cortex correlates better with recombinant sst(2) than sst(3) or sst(5) binding profiles. Finally, [(125)]LTT-SRIF28-labelled sites in rat lung express a sat, receptor profile in agreement with previous findings. SRIF receptor autoradiography was performed in the brain and peripheral tissue of rat and/or guinea-pig using a number of ligands known to label recombinant SRIF receptors: [(125)]LTT-SRIF28, [I-125]CGP 23996, [I-125]Tyr(10)-CST, or [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide. Although, [I-125]Tyr(10)-CST has been shown to label all five recombinant SRIF receptors, it is apparent that this radioligand is not useful for autoradiographic studies. By contrast, the other three ligands show good signal to noise ratios in rat or guinea-pig brain, rat lung, rat pancreas, or guinea-pig ileum. In most tissues, [I-125]Ty(3)-octreotide represents a prominent part of the binding (when compared to [I-125]LTT-SRIF28 and [I-125]CGP 23996), suggesting that sst(2) receptors are strongly expressed in most tissues; it is only in rat lung that [I-125]LTT-SRIF28 and [I-125]CGP 23996 show marked binding, whereas [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide does apparently label no sites, in agreement with the sore presence of sst, receptors in this tissue.

The current development of folate-targeted cancer therapies has created the need for quantitating functional FRs in clinical specimens. In this article, we report on the creation of a highly sensitive radioactive binding method for quantitatively measuring FR expression in frozen tissue homogenates. Expression was positive in approximately 89% of human ovarian carcinomas but was negligible in both mucinous ovarian carcinomas and normal ovary. Expression was also significant in carcinomas of the kidney, endometrium, lung, breast, bladder, and pancreas. Normal tissues from humans and six different laboratory species were also analyzed, surprisingly, some interspecies variability in FR expression (especially in kidney, spleen, and lung tissue) was found. Interestingly, normal human lung tissue displayed high expression levels, whereas expression in normal lung of the other species was negligible. However, considering that folate-drug conjugates fail to accumulate in the lungs of patients, the consequence of this finding was not considered to be of clinical concern. Overall, this new methodology is reliable for determining functional FR expression levels in tissues.. and it could possibly be a useful clinical test to determine patient candidacy for FR-targeted therapeutics.

However, 1229U91 also displaces I-125-peptide YY (PYY) with high affinity from the Y4 subtype. Previously, we reported that 1229U91 had full agonist properties for the Y4 receptor. To characterize the pharmacological properties of 1229U91 directly, we had it radioiodinated with the chloromine-T method. I-125-1229U91 bound to cell lines expressing the human Y1 and Y4 receptors with high affinity. The K-d and B-max for I-125-1229U91 binding to Y1 were 14.9 pM and 1458 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The Y4 receptor bound I-125-1229U91 with a K-d of 12.5 pM and a B-max of 1442 fmol/mg protein. When competing I-125-1229U91 binding from Y1 and Y4 receptors, a similar rank order of potency was observed: 1229U91 > [Leu(31),pro(34)]-NPY greater than or equal to [Leu(31),pro(34)]-PYY > PYY greater than or equal to NPY > NPY(2-36) > PYY(3-36). Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) potently displaced I-125-1229U91 from the Y4 receptor, but displayed little affinity for Y1. In autoradiographic studies with rat brain sections, I-125-1229U91 bound with a distribution similar to that reported for the Y1 receptor when localized with I-125-[Leu(31),Pro(34)]-PYY. Brain regions exhibiting binding sites for I-125-PP were not detected with this radioligand. Those include the interpeduncular nucleus and the periventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. Furthermore, I-125-labeled rat PP was not displaced from these areas with 10 nM 1229U91. Thus, I-125-1229U91 is a high affinity Y1 and Y4 radioligand and binds with a distribution in the rat brain consistent with the localization of the Y1 receptor.

PSMA-directed radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) with Lutetium-177 (Lu-177-PSMA) is currently undergoing clinical validation. Retrospective observational data have documented favourable safety and striking clinical responses. Recent results from a prospective clinical trial (phase II) have been published confirming high response rates, low toxicity and reduction of pain in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients who had progressed after conventional treatments. Such patients typically survive for periods less than 1.5 years. This has led some facilities to adopt compassionate or unproven use of this therapy, even in the absence of validation within a randomised-controlled trial. As a result, a consistent body of evidence exists to support efficacy and safety data of this treatment. The purpose of this guideline is to assist nuclear medicine specialists to deliver PSMA-RLT as an "unproven intervention in clinical practice", in accordance with the best currently available knowledge.

In this work, we showed that both the pore size and the pore uniformity of the breath figure patterns were controllable by solvent amount. The cross-sectional image shows that only one layer of pores was formed on the BF figure patterns. By combing the sDBF method and Pickering emulsion and using the modular building blocks, we endowed the honeycomb-structured Petri dish with molecular recognition capability via the decoration of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) nanoparticles into the honeycomb pores. The radioligand binding experiments show that the MW nanoparticles on the resultant honeycomb structures maintained high molecular binding selectivity. The reusability study indicates that MIP-BF patterns had excellent mechanical stability during the radioligand binding process. We believe that the modular approach demonstrated in this work will open up further opportunities for honeycomb structure-based chemical sensors for drug analysis, substrates for catalysts, and scaffold for cell growth.

In this study a DWAY analogue was labeled with Tc-99m-nitrido ([(TcN)-Tc-99m](2+)) core via dithiocarbamate. 2-(piperazin-1-yl) phenol dithiocarbamate was synthesized by the reaction of 2-(piperazin-1-yl) phenol with an equivalent amount of carbon disulfide in KOH solution then radiolabeled with Tc-99m-nitrido core. The final complex was characterized by HPLC and its radiochemical purity was more than 90 %. In vitro stability studies have shown the complex was stable at least 4 h after labeling at room temperature. The n-octanol/water partition coefficient experiment demonstrated log p = 1.34 for (TcN)-Tc-99m-OHPP-DTC. Biodistribution results showed that radio tracer had moderate brain uptake (0.39 +/- A 0.03 %ID/g at 15 min and 0.29 +/- A 0.02 %ID/g at 120 min) and good retention, suggesting that this complex may lead to a further development of a radiotracer with specific binding to 5-HT1A receptor.

Here, we have adapted and validated the radioligand-binding assay we recently developed against S-35-Met-interferon-omega, for rapid and specific screening for autoantibodies against interferons-alpha 2 and -alpha 8. We then investigated their potential for diagnosis and for predicting clinical manifestations in patients with APS I and different subgroups of MG. Autoantibodies against interferons-omega, -alpha 2, and -alpha 8 occurred more often in patients with APS I (100%) and MG with thymoma (73%) than in late-onset MG (39%) and early-onset MG (5%). These autoantibodies showed preferences for interferon-omega in APS I and for the interferon-alpha s in MG, hinting at thymic aberrations in both groups. The exact profile of type I interferon antibodies may indicate MG subtype and may hint at thymoma recurrence.	[Wolff, Anette S.

We previously reported the synthesis of a water soluble compound with high potency and selectivity versus the human A(3) adenosine receptor as antagonist, and herein we present an enlarged series of compounds related to the previously mentioned one. These compounds showed A(3) adenosine receptor affinity in the nanomolar range and different levels of selectivity evaluated in radioligand binding assays at human A(1), A(2)A, A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors. In particular, the effect of the heteroaryl substituents at the N5 position has been analyzed. This study allows us to recognize that the presence of a pyridinium moiety in this position not only increases water solubility but also improves or retains potency and selectivity at the human A(3) adenosine receptors. In contrast, replacement of pyridine with different heterocycles produces loss of affinity and selectivity at the human A(3) adenosine receptors. A molecular modeling study has been carried out with the aim to explain these various binding profiles.

J	Holm, J; Hansen, SI				Holm, J; Hansen, SI			Ligand binding and polymerization characteristics of human milk folate binding protein depend on concentration of purified protein and presence of amphiphatic substances	BIOSCIENCE REPORTS			English	Article						folate binding proteins; human milk	AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; COWS MILK; RECEPTOR; PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL; AGGREGATION; MEMBRANE	Two folate binding proteins are present in human milk; one of 27 kDa is a cleavage product of the other one (100 kDa) which possesses a hydrophobic membrane anchor. A drastic change of radioligand binding characteristics and appearance of aggregated weak-radioligand affinity forms on gel filtration occurred at low concentrations of both proteins in the absence of Triton X-100 or other amphiphatic substances, e. g. cetyltrimethylammonium and phospholipids. These findings are consistent with a model predicting association between unliganded and liganded monomers resulting in weak-ligand affinity dimers. Amphiphatic substances form micelles and lipid bilayers which could separate hydrophobic unliganded monomers from hydrophilic liganded monomers (monomers become hydrophilic in the liganded state) thereby preventing association between these monomeric forms prevailing at low concentrations of the protein. Bio-Gel P-300 chromatography of the 27 kDa protein revealed a pronounced polymerization tendency, which diminished with decreasing protein concentrations, however, not in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium. The data could have some bearings on observations indicating that naturally occurring amphiphatic substances, cholesterol and phospholipids, are necessary for the important clustering of membrane folate receptors.

However, there are currently no suitable small molecule radioligands for imaging alpha 7 nAChRs in the brain. In this study, we synthesized the novel radioligand [I-125]4-iodophenyl 1,4-diazaicyclo[3.2.2]nonane-4-carboxylate ([I-125]CHIBA-1006), a iodine-derivative of the selective alpha 7 nAChR agonist SSR180711, and studied the characterization of [I-125]CHIBA-1006 binding to rat brain membranes. The assays of [I-125]CHIBA-1006 binding to rat brain membranes were performed at 4 degrees C. The presence of a single saturable high-affinity binding component for [I-125] CHIBA-1006 in the rat brain was shown. Scatchard analysis revealed an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) of 88.2 +/- 21.4 nM and a maximal number of binding sites (B-max) of 65.4 +/- 6.8 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- SEM, n=4). The specific binding of [I-125]CHIBA-1006 was inhibited by a number of alpha 7 nAChR-selective ligands (e.g., unlabeled CHIBA-1006, SSR180711, CHIBA-1001, MG624 and A844606), suggesting a similarity among 7 nAChR pharmacological profiles. In contrast, alpha-bungarotoxin, MLA, and nicotine showed very weak affinity for [I-125]CHIBA-1006 binding. The regional distribution of [I-125]CHIBA-1006 binding to crude membranes from dissected regions of the rat brain was different from that of [I-125] alpha-bungarotoxin binding, suggesting that [I-125]CHIBA-1006 binding sites may not be identical to [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin binding sites in the rat brain. The present findings suggest that [I-125]CHIBA-1006 would be a useful new small molecule radioligand for alpha 7 nAChRs in the brain. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In contrast, [C-11]raclopride is an antagonist radioligand and thus binds with equal affinity to the D2 high- and low-affinity states. The aim was to compare the brain uptake, distribution and binding characteristics between [C-11]-(+)-PHNO and [C-11]raclopride in volunteers using a within-subject design. Both radioligands accumulated in brain areas rich in D-2/D-3-receptors. However, [C-11]-(+)-PHNO showed preferential uptake in the ventral striatum and globus pallidus, while [C-11]raclopride showed preferential uptake in the dorsal striatum. Mean binding potentials were higher in the putamen (4.3 vs. 2.8) and caudate (3.4 vs 2.1) for [C-11]raclopride, equal in the ventral-striatum (3.4 vs. 3.3), and higher in the globus pallidus for [C-11]-(+)PHNO (1.8 vs. 3.3). Moreover [C-11]-(+)-PHNO kinetics in the globus pallidus showed a slower washout than other regions. One explanation for the preferential binding of [C-11]-(+)-PHNO in the globus pallidus and ventral-striatum could be the presence of a greater proportion of high- vs. low-affinity receptors in these areas. Alternatively, the observed distribution could also be explained by a preferential binding of D-3-over-D-2 with [C-11]-(+)-PHNO. This differential binding of agonist vs. antagonist radioligand, especially in the critically important region of the limbic striatum/pallidum, offers new avenues to investigate the role of the dopamine system in health and disease.

In the presence of ionotropic glutamate receptor (iGluR) agonists, including N-methyl-D-aspartic (NMDA), DL-alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic (AMPA) and kainic acids (KA), at concentrations maximally effective in displacing each receptor binding, the agonists for group I mCluR subtype (+/-)-1-aminocyclopentane-trans-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (trans-ACPD) and (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((S)-3,5-DHPG) more potently displaced [H-3]QA binding in a concentration-dependent manner than their absence. The addition of these three iGluR agonists did not significantly affect potencies of (2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) and L-(+)-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4) to displace [H-3]QA binding. Scatchard analysis revealed that [H-3]QA binding consisted of a single component with a maximal number of binding sites (B-max) of 431.6 fmol/mg protein and a dissociation constant (K-d) of 50.9 nM, in the presence of the three iGluR agonists. [H-3]QA binding was markedly inhibited by GTP and its analogues; but not by GDP, GMP and ATP, under these conditions. Inhibition by GTP was seen in all central structures examined, but [H-3]QA binding was not detectable in peripheral tissues, such as pituitary and adrenal glands. Neither reverses transcription polymerase chain reaction nor immunoblotting analysis demonstrated the expression of mGluR1 and mGluR5 subunits in the aforementioned two peripheral tissues. These results suggest that [H-3]QA indeed labels group I mGluR subtype functionally coupled to CTP binding protein in rat brain synaptic membranes under the experimental conditions employed. Group I. mGluR subtype seems to be selectively distributed in central structures but not in pituitary and adrenal glands. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prostacyclin receptor expression on platelets of humans with type 2 diabetes is inversely correlated with hemoglobin A1c levels	PROSTAGLANDINS & OTHER LIPID MEDIATORS			English	Article						Prostacyclin receptor; Platelet; cAMP; Type 2 diabetes; Radioligand binding; Western blot	ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE; HUMAN-BLOOD-PLATELETS; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; LIGAND-BINDING; MELLITUS; ACTIVATION; INSULIN; SENSITIVITY; INHIBITION; ATHEROSCLEROSIS	Inappropriate platelet aggregation can result in thrombosis and tissue ischemia. When compared to healthy human platelets, those of humans with type 2 diabetes (DM2) exhibit increased aggregation when stimulated. Activation of the platelet prostacyclin receptor (IPR) results in cAMP accumulation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. We hypothesized that DM2 platelets express decreased IPR when compared to platelets of healthy humans, resulting in decreased IPR agonist-induced CAMP accumulation. We measured IPR expression with radioligand binding of [H-3]-iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analog, and with Western blotting of the IPR protein. Iloprost-stimulated platelet cAMP levels were used to identify the functional response to IPR activation. IPR binding, expression of the IPR protein and the levels of cAMP in platelets incubated with iloprost were significantly decreased in DM2 platelets when compared to platelets of healthy humans. IPR expression decreased in platelets as glycemic control of the subjects worsened, as indicated by increased hemoglobin A1c levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that reduced IPR expression in DM2 platelets may contribute to platelet hyperactivity in humans with type 2 diabetes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Sera and purified IgG from 15 paranoid schizophrenic and 15 age-matched normal subjects were studied by indirect immunofluorescence (IFI), flow cytometry, dot blot, enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), and radioligand competition assays. Astrocyte membranes and/or a synthetic peptide, with identical amino acid sequence of human M-1 and M-2 mAChR, were used as antigens. By IFI and flow cytometry procedures, we proved that serum purified IgG fraction from schizophrenic patients, reacted to astrocyte cell surface. The same antibodies were able to inhibit the binding of the specific mAChR radioligand H-3-QNB. Using synthetic peptide for dot blot and ELISA, we demonstrated that these antibodies reacted against the second extracellular loop of human cerebral M-1 and M-2 mAChR.

The characterization of the subtypes was achieved by performing competition experiments with various subtype selective drugs. In the pig retina, both alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors were detected and the proportion of sites was 70% alpha(1A)- and 30% alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors, respectively. In the pig iris, ciliary body and choroid, which are melanin-rich tissues, the non-specific binding of [H-3]-prazosin was too high to detect any of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes. However, in the albino rabbit iris, ciliary body and retina both alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors were detected. The proportion of sites in the iris was 60 % alpha(1A)- and 40% alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors, respectively. In the ciliary body and rabbit retina the proportion of sites were 70% alpha(1A)- and 30% alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors. Only the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor subtype was detected in the rabbit choroid.

Microglial activation, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as in transgenic mice expressing human amyloid-beta, appears to increase soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) levels in CSF and brain. In this study, we used two different transgenic mouse models of AD pathology and investigated the potential of TREM2 to serve as an in vivo biomarker for microglial activation in AD. Procedures We designed and generated a bispecific antibody based on the TREM2-specific monoclonal antibody mAb1729, fused to a single-chain variable fragment of the transferrin receptor binding antibody 8D3. The 8D3-moiety enabled transcytosis of the whole bispecific antibody across the blood-brain barrier. The bispecific antibody was radiolabeled with I-125 (ex vivo) or I-124 (PET) and administered to transgenic AD and wild-type (WT) control mice. Radioligand retention in the brain of transgenic animals was compared to WT mice by isolation of brain tissue at 24 h or 72 h, or with in vivo PET at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Intrabrain distribution of radiolabeled mAb1729-scFv8D3(CL) was further studied by autoradiography, while ELISA was used to determine TREM2 brain concentrations. Results Transgenic animals displayed higher total exposure, calculated as the AUC based on SUV determined at 24h, 48h, and 72h post injection, of PET radioligand [I-124]mAb1729-scFv8D3(CL) than WT mice. However, differences were not evident in single time point PET images or SUVs. Ex vivo autoradiography confirmed higher radioligand concentrations in cortex and thalamus in transgenic mice compared to WT, and TREM2 levels in brain homogenates were considerably higher in transgenic mice compared to WT. Conclusion Antibody-based radioligands, engineered to enter the brain, may serve as PET radioligands to follow changes of TREM2 in vivo, but antibody formats with faster systemic clearance to increase the specific signal in relation to that from blood in combination with antibodies showing higher affinity for TREM2 must be developed to further progress this technique for in vivo use.

Influence of ligand binding kinetics on functional inhibition of human recombinant serotonin and norepinephrine transporters	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						Binding kinetics; LeuT; Mode of inhibition; Monoamine reuptake inhibitor; NET; Neurotransmitter uptake methods; SERT; SLC6 transporter; Time-dependent inhibition	REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; IDENTIFICATION; RECEPTOR; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONISTS; MECHANISM; TARGETS; SNRIS; SITE	Introduction: Monoamine reuptake inhibitors treat a wide range of CNS disorders, including depression,obesity, and pain. The in vitro pharmacological properties of these inhibitors are determined routinely using radioligand binding and/or neurotransmitter uptake assays. Measurements from such studies can be influenced by assay design and ligand-specific characteristics, both of which may contribute to discrepancies in literature reports. Methods: We modified traditional methodologies to identify and account for factors that can confound in vitro potency determinations. Apparent equilibrium binding affinities (pK(i); values) were determined in either HEK293 cells stably-transfected with human recombinant serotonin (SERT) or norepinephrine (NET) transporters, or membranes prepared from these cell lines. Care was taken to ensure that apparent affinities were measured under conditions that minimized ligand depletion and established equilibrium for both the radioligand and the compound of interest. An unlabelled ligand kinetic method was used to approximate inhibitor binding kinetic constants and corresponding dissociation half lives. To measure inhibitory effects on substrate uptake, both radiolabeled neurotransmitter ([(3)H]-5-HT or [(3)H]-NE) and fluorescence-based assays were used. The time-dependent nature of functional inhibition was examined using a fluorescent substrate uptake assay which provided real-time measurements of NET and SERT function. Results: SERT and NET inhibitors displayed a range of affinities, potencies, and inhibition modes by binding and functional uptake assays. Binding kinetic profiles for this panel of inhibitors were diverse, and affected in vitro measures using the former techniques. Discussion: In the present study we describe key features of in vitro assay methodology that can influence the apparent pharmacological profiles of standard SERT and/or NET inhibitors. Such information can serve as a foundation for understanding the in vitro profiles of monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the context of their clinical efficacy and tolerability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

An in vitro radioligand binding assay at A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors (ARs) was conducted with a fixed extract combination of valerian and hop (Ze 91019) to investigate a possible mechanism for the pharmacological activity of the extract. Component extracts of valerian and hop were also individually investigated. The fixed combination Ze 91019 as well as the valerian extracts therein exhibited selective affinity to A(1)ARs (K-i = 0.15-0.37 mg/mL vs [H-3]CCPA). The same extracts exhibited partial agonist activity at the A(1) adenosine receptor as indicated by a lower degree of stimulation of [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in membrane preparations of CHO-hA(1) cells as compared to the full A(1) AR agonist N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). In addition valerian extract inhibited cAMP accumulation in CHO-hA(1) cell membranes. The partial agonistic activity at A(1)ARs may thus play a role in the sleep inducing effect of Ze 91019 and the valerian extract therein. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Castration refractory metastatic prostate cancer; PSMA; Radioligand therapy; 177Lu-PSMA-617; Adverse events; Toxicity	PSMA; MULTICENTER; DOSIMETRY; TRIAL	Background: The recent phase III VISION-trial confirms the treatment efficacy of radioligand therapy with [Lu-177] PSMA-617 (PSMA-RLT) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). In PSMA-RLT, the relatively low absorbed bone marrow dose allows for multiple therapy cycles with relatively low risk of haematological adverse events (hAE). However, as disease progression itself may be a cause of bone marrow impairment, the aim of this study was to assess potential relations between impairment of haematological status and response to PSMA-RLT. Methods: In this retrospective analysis, haematological parameters (HP) of 64 patients with mCRPC were systematically acquired over two cycles (12-16 weeks) of PSMA-RLT from baseline to restaging. Changes in HP were analysed qualitatively (CTCAE 5.0) and quantitatively. The HP changes from baseline were compared to quantitative and qualitative biochemical and imaging response, using PCWG3 and PROMISE criteria. Results: All grade 3/4 hAE observed were associated with disseminated or diffuse bone involvement as well as biochemical non-response at restaging. Quantitatively, at baseline, HP inversely correlated with biochemical and volumetric (on PET) tumour burden as well as bone involvement pattern (p <= 0.043). Among patients with disseminated or diffuse bone involvement, percentage changes in HP (%HP) at restaging inversely correlated with serological and imaging tumour burden (p <= 0.017). Biochemical non-responders showed a significant decrease in %HP (p <= 0.001) while HP in biochemical responders remained stable (p >= 0.079). Conclusion: During early cycles of PSMA-RLT, qualitative and quantitative bone marrow impairment appears to be closely associated with osseous tumour burden as only patients with advanced bone involvement and non-response to therapy exhibited high-grade haematological adverse events, showing a significant decline of haematological parameters. This implies that in patients with advanced mCRPC, non-response to PSMA-RLT may be a major cause of bone marrow impairment during early treatment cycles.

Affinity, binding kinetics and functional characterization of draflazine analogues for human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (SLC29A1)	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (SLC29A1); Inhibitors; Binding kinetics; Radioligand binding assay; Label-free functional assay	RESIDENCE TIME; INHIBITION; SELECTIVITY; ENT1; MECHANISMS; CONSTANT; DURATION; DILAZEP; R75231; SERIES	In the last decade it has been recapitulated that receptor-ligand binding kinetics is a relevant additional parameter in drug discovery to improve in vivo drug efficacy and safety. The equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (ENT1, SLC29A1) is an important drug target, as transporter inhibition is a potential treatment of ischemic heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Currently, two non-selective ENT1 inhibitors (dilazep and dipyridamole) are on the market as vasodilators. However, their binding kinetics are unknown; moreover, novel, more effective and selective inhibitors are still needed. Hence, this study focused on the incorporation of binding kinetics for finding new and improved ENT1 inhibitors. We developed a radioligand competition association assay to determine the binding kinetics of ENT1 inhibitors with four chemical scaffolds (including dilazep and dipyridamole). The kinetic parameters were compared to the affinities obtained from a radioligand displacement assay. Three of the scaffolds presented high affinities with relatively fast dissociation kinetics, yielding short to moderate residence times (RTs) at the protein (1-44 min). While compounds from the fourth scaffold, i.e. draflazine analogues, also had high affinity, they displayed significantly longer RTs, with one analogue (4) having a RT of over 10 h. Finally, a label-free assay was used to evaluate the impact of divergent ENT1 inhibitor binding kinetics in a functional assay. It was shown that the potency of compound 4 increased with longer incubation times, which was not observed for draflazine, supporting the importance of long RT for increased target-occupancy and effect. In conclusion, our research shows that high affinity ENT1 inhibitors show a large variation in residence times at this transport protein. As a consequence, incorporation of binding kinetic parameters adds to the design criteria and may thus result in a different lead compound selection. Taken together, this kinetic approach could inspire future drug discovery in the field of ENT1 and membrane transport proteins in general.

Ligands binding this target may be used to visualize hypoxia, tumor manifestation or treat tumors by endoradiotherapy. Methods: Phage display was performed with a 12 amino acid phage display library by panning against a recombinant extracellular domain of human carbonic anhydrase IX. The identified peptide CaIX-P1 was chemically synthesized and tested in vitro on various cell lines and in vivo in Balb/c nu/nu mice carrying subcutaneously transplanted tumors. Binding, kinetic and competition studies were performed on the CAIX positive human renal cell carcinoma cell line SKRC 52, the CAIX negative human renal cell carcinoma cell line CaKi 2, the human colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT 116 and on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Organ distribution studies were carried out in mice, carrying SKRC 52 tumors. RNA expression of CAIX in HCT 116 and HUVEC cells was investigated by quantitative real time PCR. Results: In vitro binding experiments of (125)I-labeled-CaIX-P1 revealed an increased uptake of the radioligand in the CAIX positive renal cell carcinoma cell line SKRC 52. Binding of the radioligand in the colorectal carcinoma cell line HCT 116 increased with increasing cell density and correlated with the mRNA expression of CAIX. Radioligand uptake was inhibited up to 90% by the unlabeled CaIX-P1 peptide, but not by the negative control peptide octreotide at the same concentration. No binding was demonstrated in CAIX negative CaKi 2 and HUVEC cells. Organ distribution studies revealed a higher accumulation in SKRC 52 tumors than in heart, spleen, liver, muscle, intestinum and brain, but a lower uptake compared to blood and kidney. Conclusions: These data indicate that CaIX-P1 is a promising candidate for the development of new ligands targeting human carbonic anhydrase IX.

The objective of the study was to investigate in vivo occupancy of H-3 receptors by BF2.649 using PET brain imaging with the H-3 receptor antagonist radioligand [C-11]GSK189254. Experimental Approach Six healthy adult participants were scanned with [C-11]GSK189254. Participants underwent a total of two PET scans on separate days, 3 h after oral administration of placebo or after pitolisant hydrochloride (40 mg). [C-11]GSK189254 regional total distribution volumes were estimated in nine brain regions of interest with the two tissue-compartment model with arterial input function using a common V-ND across the regions. Brain receptor occupancies were calculated with the Lassen plot. Key Results Pitolisant, at the dose administered, provided high (84 +/- 7%; mean +/- SD) occupancy of H-3 receptors. The drug was well-tolerated, and participants experienced few adverse events. Conclusion and Implications The administration of pitolisant (40 mg) produces a high occupancy of H-3 receptors and may be a new tool for the treatment of a variety of CNS disorders that are associated with mechanisms involving H-3 receptors.

Earlier binding studies were predominantly done with broken cell preparations with the tritiated D-2-receptor antagonists [H-3]-raclopride, a hydrophilic benzamide, and [H-3]-spiperone, a highly hydrophobic butyrophenone. Here we compared [H-3]-raclopride and [H-3]-spiperone binding properties in intact Chinese Hamster Ovary cells stably expressing recombinant human D-2L-receptors. Specific binding of both radioligands occurred to a comparable number of sites. In contrast to the rapid dissociation of [H-3] -raclopride in both medium only and in the presence of an excess of unlabelled ligand [H-3]-spiperone dissociation was only observed in the latter condition, and it was still slower than in broken cell preparations. However, this could not explain the pronounced difference in the potency of some unlabelled ligands to compete with both radioligands. To integrate these new findings, a model is proposed in which raclopride approaches the receptor from the aqueous phase, while spiperone approaches the receptor by lateral diffusion within the membrane.

[F-18]flumazenil via standard nucleophilic radiotluorination of the corresponding nitro-analog Ro 15-2344 has been developed. The labeling was performed by employing the (KF)-F-18/kryptofix complex in DNIF at 160 degrees C for 30 min and equimolar ratio [K/K2.2.2]F-+18(-)/precursor. Under these conditions, an F-18 incorporation rate into flumazenil was in the range of 55-60%. The final product was isolated by HPLC purification within a total synthesis time of 75 min and a radiochemical yield of about 30% (EOB). Human post-mortem whole-hemisphere autoradiography of brain sections demonstrated selective uptake of the radioligand in the areas of high density of the central benzodiazepine receptors (BZR). PET studies in a cynomolgus monkey and metabolite studies by HPLC demonstrated similar results by [F-18]flumazenil as for [C-11]flumazenil. In blocking experiments, almost all radioactivity was inhibited by the addition of unlabeled flumazenil. [F-18]Flumazenil is a suitable radioligand for PET assessment of the BZR.

One member of this family, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), is secreted by the pituitary and is involved in the control of male and female reproduction. Herein, we describe the construction of baculoviruses for glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusions of the human FSH (hFSH) subunits and their expression in insect cells, either alone or with the complementary non-fused FSH subunits (FSHalpha or FSHbeta). Only the GST-BV-hFSHalpha monomer and the GST-BV-hFSHalpha/BV-hFSHbeta (GST-BV-hFSH) heterodimer were efficiently secreted into the culture supernatant. The hybrid molecule, GST-BV-hFSH, was affinity purified in one step, and demonstrated activity in receptor-radioligand binding assays and in a cAMP accumulation assay. The use of GST-BV-hFSHalpha provides a novel and efficient method for purifying and studying members of the glycoprotein hormone family derived from the culture supernatant or subcellular fractions of the cell.

In sea urchin eggs, subthreshold concentrations of NAADP can cause full inactivation of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release, an effect that may be related to the ability of the target protein to bind its ligand in an essentially irreversible manner. In the present study, we found that K+ ions inhibit dissociation of NAADP from sea urchin egg homogenates. In low K+-containing media, an addition of excess unlabelled NAADP effectively displaced bound radioligand whereas dilution of radioligand initiated only partial dissociation. The inhibitory effects of K+ on dissociation of NAADP were concentration dependent, reversible and persisted after detergent solubilization. Lowering [K+] of the medium decreased the sensitivity of NAADP receptors for their ligand in stimulating Ca2+ release, but it did not affect inactivation of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release by subthreshold concentrations of NAADP. Our results are consistent with the observation of multiple conformations of the NAADP receptor that are readily revealed in low K+-containing media.

Nonetheless, a therapeutic response may fail to appear in a proportion of patients. This study aims to identify routinely obtainable pre- and intratherapeutic parameters to allow a prediction of overall survival in patients receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy. Methods: Between January 2015 and December 2020 52 patients treated with a total of 146 cycles Lu-177-PSMA-617-RLT were retrospectively analysed in a single-center trial. The median overall survival time (OS) was compared to pre-therapeutic serological parameters, the extend of metastatic spread and previously performed therapies using Kaplan-Meier estimators and multivariate Cox-regression. Bonferroni-Holm correction was performed on all statistical tests. Results: The median OS of all patients was 55.6 weeks. Multivariate Cox-regression revealed significant lower survival for decreased pretherapeutic hemoglobin levels (HR 0.698 per g/dl; 95%-CI 0.560-0.872; p= 0.001), increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (HR 1.073 per 25 U/l; 95%-CI 1.024-1.125; p = 0.003) and the presence of hepatic metastasis (HR 6.981; 95%-CI 2.583-18.863; p <0.001). Increased pretherapeutic c-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were also associated with a shorter survival. A prostate-specific antigen decline after one therapy cycle did not significantly correlate with an increased survival. No significant relations were observed between overall survival time and other serological parameters or previously performed therapies. Conclusion: Pre-therapeutic hemoglobin and LDH levels, as well as the presence of hepatic metastasis are independent predictors of overall survival in patients receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617-RLT. CRP, ALP and GGT levels cloud be utilized as additional decision aids when a Lu-177-PSMA-617-RLT is intended.

In this study, we aimed to develop [C-11]MTP38 as a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for PDE7. Methods [C-11]MTP38 was radiosynthesized by C-11-cyanation of a bromo precursor with [C-11]HCN. PET scans of rat and rhesus monkey brains and in vitro autoradiography of brain sections derived from these species were conducted with [C-11]MTP38. In monkeys, dynamic PET data were analyzed with an arterial input function to calculate the total distribution volume (V-T). The non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) in the striatum was also determined by a reference tissue model with cerebellar reference. Finally, striatal occupancy of PDE7 by an inhibitor was calculated in monkeys according to changes in BPND. Results [C-11]MTP38 was synthesized with radiochemical purity >= 99.4% and molar activity of 38.6 +/- 12.6 GBq/mu mol. Autoradiography revealed high radioactivity in the striatum and its reduction by non-radiolabeled ligands, in contrast with unaltered autoradiographic signals in other regions. In vivo PET after radioligand injection to rats and monkeys demonstrated that radioactivity was rapidly distributed to the brain and intensely accumulated in the striatum relative to the cerebellum. Correspondingly, estimated V-T values in the monkey striatum and cerebellum were 3.59 and 2.69 mL/cm(3), respectively. The cerebellar V-T value was unchanged by pretreatment with unlabeled MTP38. Striatal BPND was reduced in a dose-dependent manner after pretreatment with MTP-X, a PDE7 inhibitor. Relationships between PDE7 occupancy by MTP-X and plasma MTP-X concentration could be described by Hill's sigmoidal function. Conclusion We have provided the first successful preclinical demonstration of in vivo PDE7 imaging with a specific PET radioligand. [C-11]MTP38 is a feasible radioligand for evaluating PDE7 in the brain and is currently being applied to a first-in-human PET study.

Recently, the concept of modifying PSMA radioligands with an albumin-binding entity was demonstrated as a promising measure to increase the tumor uptake in preclinical experiments. The aim of this study was to translate the concept to a clinical setting and evaluate the safety and dosimetry of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56, a novel PSMA radioligand with albumin-binding properties. Methods Ten patients (71.8 +/- 8.2 years) with mCRPC received an activity of 3360 +/- 393 MBq (120-160 mu g) [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 followed by whole-body SPECT/CT imaging over 7 days. Volumes of interest were defined on the SPECT/CT images for dosimetric evaluation for healthy tissue and tumor lesions. General safety and therapeutic efficacy were assessed by measuring blood biomarkers. Results [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was well tolerated, and no severe adverse events were observed. SPECT images revealed longer circulation of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 in the blood with the highest uptake in tumor lesions at 48 h post injection. Compared with published data for other therapeutic PSMA radioligands (e.g. PSMA-617 and PSMA I&T), normalized absorbed doses of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 were up to 2.3-fold higher in tumor lesions (6.64 +/- 6.92 Gy/GBq) and similar in salivary glands (0.87 +/- 0.43 Gy/GBq). Doses to the kidneys and red marrow (2.54 +/- 0.94 Gy/GBq and 0.29 +/- 0.07 Gy/GBq, respectively) were increased. Conclusion Our data demonstrated that the concept of albumin-binding PSMA-radioligands is feasible and leads to increased tumor doses. After further optimization of the ligand design, the therapeutic outcomes may be improved for patients with prostate cancer.

Methods: D2/3R binding was measured with small animal SPECT in baseline and after challenge with either 1 mg/kg MUS or 1 mg/kg BIC, using [I-123] IBZM as radioligand. Motor/exploratory behaviors were assessed for 30min in an open field prior to radioligand administration. Anatomical information was gained with a dedicated small animal MRI tomograph. Based on the Paxinos rat brain atlas, regions of interest were defined on SPECT-MRI overlays. Estimations of the binding potentials in baseline and after challenges were obtained by computing ratios of the specifically bound compartments to the cerebellar reference region. Results: After MUS, D2/3R binding was significantly reduced in caudateputamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, substania nigra/ventral tegmental area, and posterior hippocampus relative to baseline (0.005 <= p <= 0.012). In all these areas, except for the thalamus, D2/3R binding was negatively correlated with grooming in the first half and positively correlated with various motor/exploratory behaviors in the second half of the testing session. After BIC, D2/3R binding was significantly elevated in caudateputamen (p = 0.022) and thalamus (p = 0.047) relative to baseline. D2/3R binding in caudateputamen and thalamus was correlated negatively with sitting duration and sitting frequency and positively with motor/exploratory behaviors in the first half of the testing time. Conclusions: Findings indicate direct GABAergic control over nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine levels in relation to behavioral action. This may be of relevance for neuropsychiatric conditions such as anxiety disorder and schizophrenia, which are characterized by both dopaminergic and GABAergic dysfunction.

Ten healthy male volunteers, 23-60 years of age, were enrolled in this PET study; seven subjects participated in the evaluation of test-retest reliability and three subjects in whole body dosimetry. Subjects were administered intravenous bolus injections of approximately 1100 MBq (30 mCi) [C-11]RO5013853 with a high specific activity of about 481 GBq (13 Ci)/mu mol. Standard compartmental model analysis with arterial plasma input function, and an alternative noninvasive analysis method which was evaluated and validated by occupancy studies in both baboons and humans, were performed. Mean parameter estimates of the volumes of distribution (V-T) obtained by a 2-tissue 5-parameter model were higher in the cerebellum, pons, and thalamus (1.99 to 2.59 mL/mL), and lower in the putamen, caudate, and cortical areas (0.86 to 1.13 mL/mL), with estimates showing less than 10% difference between test and retest scans. Tracer retention was effectively blocked by the specific glycine reuptake inhibitor (GRI), bitopertin (RG1678). [C-11]RO5013853 was safe and well tolerated. Human dosimetry studies showed that the effective dose was approximately 0.0033 mSv/MBq, with the liver receiving the highest absorbed dose. In conclusion, quantitative dynamic PET of the human brain after intravenous injection of [C-11]RO5013853 attains reliable measurements of GlyT1 binding in accordance with the expected transporter distribution in the human brain. [C-11]RO5013853 is a radioligand suitable for further clinical PET studies. Full characterization of a novel radiotracer for GlyT1 in humans is provided. The tracer has subsequently been used to assess receptor occupancy in healthy volunteers and to estimate occupancy at doses associated with best efficacy in a clinical trial with schizophrenic patients with predominantly negative symptoms.

[C-11]-Mecamylamine was prepared and evaluated as a putative radioligand for positron emission tomography to study nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The radiosynthesis consisted in the [C-11]-methylation of the desmethyl precursor within 40 min with 30-40% radiochemical yield decay corrected. Biodistribution studies in rats showed that radioligand crossed the blood-brain barrier (0.39% ID at 30 min) and only unmetabolized tracer was recovered from brain at 45 min. Ex vivo autoradiography studies in rats did not indicate preferential uptake, and pre-treatment mecamylamine or with chlorisondamine, an nicotinic receptor inhibitor, did not demonstrate a significant specific binding. To investigate possible specie differences and effects of anesthesia, in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) studies were carried out on anaesthetized baboons and conscious macaques. The regional brain distribution of [C-11]-mecamylamine in the two species of primates exhibited similar kinetics as did the rat with steady state reached about 45-50 min after radiotracer administration. Uptake values were two-fold higher in brain of conscious macaque than in anaesthetized baboon (thalamus: 0.258% ID/(kg mL) in conscious macaques and 0.129% ID/(kg mL) in baboons). PET images showed a radioactivity distribution which was quite homogeneous throughout the brain but with somewhat higher uptake in grey matter than in white. Brain distribution was unaltered by saturation or displacement studies. Possible explanation for the failure to establish specific binding in vivo could be long-lived structural modifications of the ionotropic channel by the unlabeled ligand administered before the tracer. In conclusion, [C-11]-mecamylamine did not satisfy the requirements for a PET tracer of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Identification of a Putative α-synuclein Radioligand Using an <i>in silico</i> Similarity Search	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alpha-synuclein; Similarity search; Photocrosslinking; Positron emission tomography; PET	LEWY BODY; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; HIGH-AFFINITY; PARKINSON; DISEASE; FIBRIL; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; DERIVATIVES; GUIDELINES	PurposePrevious studies from our lab utilized an ultra-high throughput screening method to identify compound 1 as a small molecule that binds to alpha-synuclein (alpha-synuclein) fibrils. The goal of the current study was to conduct a similarity search of 1 to identify structural analogs having improved in vitro binding properties for this target that could be labeled with radionuclides for both in vitro and in vivo studies for measuring alpha-synuclein aggregates.MethodsUsing 1 as a lead compound in a similarity search, isoxazole derivative 15 was identified to bind to alpha-synuclein fibrils with high affinity in competition binding assays. A photocrosslinkable version was used to confirm binding site preference. Derivative 21, the iodo-analog of 15, was synthesized, and subsequently radiolabeled isotopologs [I-125]21 and [C-11]21 were successfully synthesized for use in in vitro and in vivo studies, respectively. [I-125]21 was used in radioligand binding studies in post-mortem Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain homogenates. In vivo imaging of an alpha-synuclein mouse model and non-human primates was performed with [C-11]21.ResultsIn silico molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulation studies for a panel of compounds identified through a similarity search, were shown to correlate with K-i values obtained from in vitro binding studies. Improved affinity of isoxazole derivative 15 for alpha-synuclein binding site 9 was indicated by photocrosslinking studies with CLX10. Design and successful (radio)synthesis of iodo-analog 21 of isoxazole derivative 15 enabled further in vitro and in vivo evaluation. K-d values obtained in vitro with [I-125]21 for alpha-synuclein and A beta(42) fibrils were 0.48 +/- 0.08 nM and 2.47 +/- 1.30 nM, respectively. [I-125]21 showed higher binding in human postmortem PD brain tissue compared with AD tissue, and low binding in control brain tissue. Lastly, in vivo preclinical PET imaging showed elevated retention of [C-11]21 in PFF-injected mouse brain. However, in PBS-injected control mouse brain, slow washout of the tracer indicates high non-specific binding. [C-11]21 showed high initial brain uptake in a healthy non-human primate, followed by fast washout that may be caused by rapid metabolic rate (21% intact [C-11]21 in blood at 5 min p.i.).ConclusionThrough a relatively simple ligand-based similarity search, we identified a new radioligand that binds with high affinity (<10 nM) to alpha-synuclein fibrils and PD tissue. Although the radioligand has suboptimal selectivity for alpha-synuclein towards A beta and high non-specific binding, we show here that a simple in silico approach is a promising strategy to identify novel ligands for target proteins in the CNS with the potential to be radiolabeled for PET neuroimaging studies.

Administration Routes for SSTR-/PSMA- and FAP-Directed Theranostic Radioligands in Mice	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						radioligand; biodistribution; small-animal PET; theranos-tic; intravenous; subcutaneous	DOSIMETRY; THERAPY	The NETTER-1, VISION, and TheraP trials proved the efficacy of repeat intravenous application of small radioligands. Application by subcuta-neous, intraperitoneal, or oral routes is an important alternative and may yield comparable or favorable organ and tumor radioligand uptake. Here, we assessed organ and tumor biodistribution for various radioligand application routes in healthy mice and models of cancer expressing somatostatin receptor (SSTR), prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and fibroblast activation protein (FAP). Methods: Healthy and tumor-bearing male C57BL/6 or NOD SCID y-mice, respectively, were administered a mean of 6.0 ?? 0.5 MBq of 68Ga-DOTATOC (RM1-SSTR allograft), 5.3 ?? 0.3 MBq of 68Ga-PSMA11 (RM1-PSMA allograft), or 4.8 ?? 0.2 MBq of 68Ga-FAPI46 (HT1080-FAP xenograft) by intravenous, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, or oral routes. In vivo PET images and ex vivo biodistribution in tumor, organs, and the injection site were assessed up to 5 h after injection. Healthy mice were monitored for up to 7 d after the last scan for signs of stress or adverse reactions. Results: After intravenous, intraperito-neal, and subcutaneous radioligand administration, average residual activity at the injection site was less than 17 percentage injected activity per gram (%IA/g) at 1 h after injection, less than 10 %IA/g at 2 h after injection, and no more than 4 %IA/g at 4 h after injection for all radioligands. After oral administration, at least 50 %IA/g remained within the intestines until 4 h after injection. Biodistribution in organs of healthy mice was nearly equivalent after intravenous, intraperito-neal, and subcutaneous application at 1 h after injection and all sub-sequent time points (???1 %IA/g for liver, blood, and bone marrow; 11.2 ?? 1.4 %IA/g for kidneys). In models for SSTR-, PSMA-and FAP-expressing cancer, tumor uptake was increased or equivalent for intraperitoneal/subcutaneous versus intravenous injection at 5 h after injection (ex vivo): SSTR, 7.2 ?? 1.0 %IA/g (P = 0.0197)/6.5 ?? 1.3 %IA/g (P = 0.0827) versus 2.9 ?? 0.3 %IA/g, respectively; PSMA, 3.4 ?? 0.8 %IA/g (P = 0.9954)/3.9 ?? 0.8 %IA/g (P = 0.8343) versus 3.3 ?? 0.7% IA/g, respectively; FAP, 1.1 ?? 0.1 %IA/g (P = 0.9805)/ 1.1 ?? 0.1 %IA/g (P = 0.7446) versus 1.0 ?? 0.2 %IA/g, respectively. Conclusion: In healthy mice, biodistribution of small theranostic ligands after intraperitoneal/subcutaneous application is nearly equivalent to that after intravenous injection. Subcutaneous administra-tion resulted in the highest absolute SSTR tumor and tumor-to-organ uptake as compared with the intravenous route, warranting further clinical assessment.

The aim of our study was to evaluate and compare the feasibility of different approaches of image-based absorbed dose estimation in terms of accuracy and effort in clinical routine. Methods Whole-body planar images and SPECT/CT images were acquired from 24 patients and 65 cycles at 24h, 48h, and >= 96h after administration of a mean activity of 6.4 GBq [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (range 3-10.9 GBq). Dosimetry was performed by use of the following approaches: 2D planar-based dosimetry, 3D SPECT/CT-based dosimetry, and hybrid dosimetry combining 2D and 3D data. Absorbed doses were calculated according to IDAC 2.1 for the kidneys, the liver, the salivary glands, and bone metastases. Results Mean absorbed doses estimated by 3D dosimetry (the reference method) were 0.54 +/- 0.28 Gy/GBq for the kidneys, 0.10 +/- 0.05 Gy/GBq for the liver, 0.81 +/- 0.34 Gy/GBq for the parotid gland, 0.72 +/- 0.39 Gy/GBq for the submandibular gland, and 1.68 +/- 1.32 Gy/GBq for bone metastases. Absorbed doses of normal organs estimated by hybrid dosimetry showed small, non-significant differences (median up to 4.0%) to the results of 3D dosimetry. Using 2D dosimetry, in contrast, significant differences (median up to 10.9%) were observed. Regarding bone metastases, small, but significant differences (median up to 7.0%) of absorbed dose were found for both, 2D dosimetry and hybrid dosimetry. Bland-Altman analysis revealed high agreement between hybrid dosimetry and 3D dosimetry for normal organs and bone metastases, but substantial differences between 2D dosimetry and 3D dosimetry. Conclusion Hybrid dosimetry provides high accuracy in estimation of absorbed dose in comparison to 3D dosimetry for all important organs and is therefore feasible for use in individualized PSMA-RLT.

Recently, measurements of whole-body tumour burden by [Ga-68] PSMA-11 PET/CT have been reported for response assessment in oligometastasic patients. The present study investigated the association of PSMA PET derived parameters and serum PSA level before and after [Lu-177]PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT). Methods This retrospective study assessed whole-body PSMA tumour volume (PSMA-TV) in 10 patients with multifocal to diffuse metastases before and after 2 cycles of RLT using volume of interest (VOI) analysis. A standardized uptake value (SUV) threshold-based approach was used to semi-automatically delineate all voxels with a SUV >= 2.0 g/ml using the software ROVER (R) (ABX Radeberg, Germany). Voxels with physiological tracer uptake (e.g. kidneys) were excluded manually. Correlations between PSMA-TV and serum PSA level before and after two cycles of RLT as well as changes thereof (Delta PSMA-TV and Delta PSA, respectively) were calculated. Results Changes of Delta PSMA-TV and Delta PSA were concordant in 7 of 10 patients. Whereas a good correlation was found between PSMA-TV and PSA before RLT (rho = 0.81, p = 0.0049), this correlation was attenuated after RLT (rho = 0.64, p = 0.0479). Consequently, no association was found between Delta PSMA-TV and Delta PSA (rho = 0.39, p = 0.26). Conclusion The attenuation of the correlation of PSA and PSMA-TV after RLT suggests that in patients with advanced disease the comparison of imaging based parameters such as PSMA-TV and PSA level might be useful for an adequate monitoring of treatment response.

We aim to validate 4-[F-18]-ADAM (N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[F-18]fluorophenylthio)benzylamine) as a SERT imaging agent in rats using micro-positron emission tomography (micro-PET) and autoradiography. Sixty to ninety min after injecting 4-[F-18]-ADAM, specific uptake ratios (SURs) were determined by micro-PET measurements in various brain regions of normal control rats. For n=3, the SUR in the midbrain was 4.94 +/- 0.16, for the hypothalamus it was 4.39 +/- 0.031 and for the caudate it was 4.18 +/- 0.53. The retention of 4-[F-18]-ADAM in the hypothalamus and midbrain regions increased rapidly between 5 to 10 min after injection and declined thereafter. The SURs determined by autoradiography were: 9.31 +/- 1.41 for the midbrain, 7.15 +/- 1.45 for the hypothalamus and 5.22 +/- 1.14 for the caudate putamen. Both micro-PET and autoradiography studies revealed a dose-dependent progressive inhibition of radioligand uptake in the frontal cortex, caudate putamen and hypothalamus in rats treated with 0.01 to 0.25 mg/kg paroxetine. A decrease in 4-[F-18]-ADAM uptake of approximately 84% was observed in the midbrain of rats pretreated with 0.25 mg/kg paroxetine as compared to controls (4.94 +/- 0.16 versus 0.80 +/- 0.17, n=3). Both 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine and p-chloroamphetamine-treated rats showed pronounced reduction in 4-[F-18]-ADAM binding when compared to normal controls. Rats pretreated with p-chloroamphetamine exhibited significant inhibition of 4-[F-18]-ADAM uptake in brain regions rich in SERT over a period of four weeks. Thus, 4-[F-18]-ADAM is a SERT-specific radioligand that may be useful for evaluating neuropsychiatric conditions involving serotonergic dysfunction. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Bmax of (+)-[Br-76]A-69024 measured in vitro on rat striatum membranes was 320 +/- 25 fmoles/mg protein with an apparent dissociation constant of Kd = 0.6 +/- 0.1 nM. The inactive enantiomer, (-)-[Br-76]A-69024, displayed no affinity in the same assay. In vivo, the biodistribution (+)-[Br-76]A-69024 in rats showed a rapid and high uptake in the striatum (1% ID/g), followed by a slow wash out. The striatum/cerebellum concentration ratio (index of specific binding) reached a maximum value of 10 at 60 minutes post injection. A tissue to cerebellum ratio of 2.8 and 1.5 was also observed for frontal and posterior cortex respectively. With the pharmacologic ally inactive enantiomer, (-)-[Br-76]A-69024, the brain uptake was determined to be non specific since a striatum/cerebellum ratio of approximately 1 was observed throughout the time course of the experiment. The selectivity of (+)-[Br-76]A-69024 uptake was demonstrated m competition experiments. The specific uptake in the striatum and cortical regions was completely prevented after administration of the D1 antagonist SCH 23390. Pre-treatment of rats with unlabelled (+)A-69024 also displayed the same regional inhibition of (+)-[Br-76]A-69024 uptake. Pre-administration of rats with spiperone (D2) and ketanserin (5-HT2/5-HT2C) showed no inhibitory effect on (+)-[76Br]A-69024 uptake in any brain region. Using (+)- [Br-76]A-69024, PET study in baboon demonstrated a preferential accumulation of the radioactivity in the striatum, frontal and posterior cortex which was displaced to the level of the cerebellum by SCH 23390. These results suggest that ( +)- [Br-76]A-69024 may deserve further investigation as a potential radioligand for studying striatal and cortical dopamine D1 receptors using PET.

Therefore, we developed the new radioligand [H-3]2-amino-4-picoline to measure binding of these compounds to the three human NO synthase (NOS) isoenzymes. Aminopicoline is a potent and nonselective inhibitor of all three isoforms. [H-3]2-amino-4-picoline bound saturably and with high affinity to human NOSs. Affinity constants (K-D values) of 59, 111, and 136 nM were obtained for the inducible, neuronal, and endothelial NOS isoforms (iNOS, nNOS, eNOS). Binding of [H-3]2-amino-4-picoline was competitive with the substrate arginine. From all the inhibitors tested, AMT (2-amino-5,6-dihydro-6-methyl-4H-1,3-thiazine hydrochloride) showed the highest affinity and no selectivity. L-NIL [L-N-6-(1-Iminoethyl) lysine hydrochloride] and aminoguanidine were moderately iNOS-selective while L-NA (N-G-nitro-L-arginine) and L-NAME (N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride) showed selectivity toward the constitutive isoforms. High iNOS versus eNOS selectivity was found for 1400W, whereas several isothiourea derivatives and 1400W displayed moderate n- versus eNOS selectivity. To relate the affinity of these compounds to their inhibitory potency, we measured the inhibitory potency under almost identical conditions using a new microtiter plate assay. The inhibitory potency of selective and nonselective NOS inhibitors was almost exactly mirrored by their affinity toward the different isoenzymes. Highly significant correlations were obtained between the potency of enzyme inhibition and the inhibition of [H-3]2-amino-4-picoline binding for all three isoenzymes. These data show that the potency and selectivity of NOS inhibitors are solely determined by their affinity toward the different isoforms. Furthermore, these data identify the new radioligand [3H]2-amino-4-picoline as a very useful radiolabel for the investigation of the substrate binding site of all three isoforms.

Human prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP) has been identified as an endogenous ligand for GPR10, and occurs as 31 and 20 amino acid forms. The present study characterizes the binding of [I-125]-PrRP-20 to HEK293 cells stably expressing GPR10 receptors. 2 Specific binding of [I-125]-PrRP-20 was saturable, and analysis suggested evidence of both high and low affinity sites, with K-D values of 0.026+/-0.006 and 0.57+/-0.14 nM respectively, and B-max values of 3010+/-400 and 8570+/-2240 fmol mg protein(-1) respectively. Kinetic studies were unable to distinguish two sites, but single site analysis of association and dissociation data produced a K-D of 0.012 nM. 3 Competition studies revealed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 all display high affinity for GPR10. A range of other drugs which are known ligands at receptors which share limited homology with GPR10 were also tested. None of the drugs tested, including the RF-amide neuropeptide FF, demonstrated any affinity for GPR10. 4 Human PrRP-20 failed to alter basal or forskolin-stimulated levels of intracellular cyclic AMP in HEK293-GPR10 cells, suggesting that GPR10 does not couple via either G(s) or G(i). 5 Functional studies using measurements of intracellular calcium confirmed that human and rat PrRP-20 and PrRP-31 are all potent, full agonists at the GPR10 receptor. The response was blocked both by thapsigargin, indicating mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ stores. 6 These studies indicate that [I-125]-PrRP-20 is a specific, high affinity radioligand for GPR1. The availability of this radioligand binding assay will be a valuable tool for the investigation of the key features involved in PrRP binding and studies on the localization and function of GPR10.

Evaluation of Two Potent and Selective PET Radioligands to Image COX-1 and COX-2 in Rhesus Monkeys	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						cyclooxygenase-1; cyclooxygenase-2; positron-emission tomography; inflammation; nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents	CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 EXPRESSION; ACTIVATED MICROGLIA; GENE DISRUPTION; BRAIN; DISEASE; INFLAMMATION; INHIBITORS; ALZHEIMER; CELECOXIB; ESTER	This study assessed whether the newly developed PET radioligands C-11-PS13 and C-11-MC1 could image constitutive levels of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, respectively, in rhesus monkeys. Methods: After intravenous injection of either radioligand, 24 whole-body PET scans were performed. To measure enzyme-specific uptake, scans of the 2 radioligands were also performed after administration of a nonradioactive drug preferential for either COX-1 or COX-2. Concurrent venous samples were obtained to measure parent radioligand concentrations. SUVs were calculated from 10 to 90 min. Results: C-11-PS13 showed specific uptake in most organs, including spleen, gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and brain, which was blocked by COX-1, but not COX-2, preferential inhibitors. Specific uptake of C-11-MC1 was not observed in any organ except the ovaries and possibly kidneys. Conclusion: The findings suggest that C-11-PS13 has adequate signal in monkeys to justify its extension to human subjects. In contrast, C-11-MC1 is unlikely to show significant signal in healthy humans, though it may be able to do so in inflammatory conditions.

Due to the wide range of possible applications for PET imaging of the NET together with the limitations of currently available radioligands, novel PET tracers for imaging of the cerebral NET with improved pharmacological and pharmacodynamic properties are needed. Methods: The present study addresses the radiosynthesis and first preclinical evaluation of the novel NET PET tracer [C-11]Me@HAPTHI by describing its affinity, selectivity, metabolic stability, plasma free fraction, blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and binding behaviour in in vitro autoradiography. Results: [C-11]Me@HAPTHI was prepared and displayed outstanding affinity and selectivity as well as excellent in vitro metabolic stability, and it is likely to penetrate the BBB. Moreover, selective NET binding in in vitro autoradiography was observed in human brain and rat heart tissue samples. Conclusions: All preclinical results and radiosynthetic key-parameters indicate that the novel benzothiadiazole dioxide-based PET tracer [C-11]Me@HAPTHI is a feasible and improved NET radioligand and might prospectively facilitate clinical NET imaging.

Sixty 4- and 60 27-month rabbits received the alpha 7 nAChR agonist (MEM-3389), galantamine, or vehicle during training in trace eyeblink classical conditioning. Brain tissue from the best and worst young and older learners was analyzed with radioligand binding. Vehicle-treated 4- and 27-month good learners had higher alpha beta heteromeric nAChR binding in hippocampus and temporal parietal cortex than poor learners, and this result was replicated in both age groups of rabbits treated with galantamine. Results indicate that anatomically more numerous nAChRs or functional activation of a greater number of nAChRs may characterize animals demonstrating optimal learning. During normal aging the expression of high-affinity binding sites declines. Age-related changes in the expression of hippocampal alpha beta heteromeric nAChRs may account for some of the documented age-related impairment in learning. However, individual differences in alpha beta heteromeric nAChRs also exist early in life, as better learning in 4-month rabbits was associated with significantly higher binding.

(S)-[C-11]CGP12388 was administered to five healthy volunteers on two separate days (control and pindolol block study). Arterial plasma samples were used to determine clearance, metabolites, and protein binding of the radioligand. Heart, lung and spleen showed high uptake of radioactivity, which was strongly suppressed (68-77%) by pindolol. Plasma clearance of (S)-[C-11]CGP 12388 was rapid, binding to plasma proteins was low (53 +/- 4%), and the radioligand was slowly metabolized. (S)-[C-11]CGP12388 produces high-quality images of the human thorax. Uptake of (S)-[C-11]CGP 12388 in heart, lung and spleen represents binding to beta -adrenoceptors. (S)-[C-11]CGP 12388 seems useful for imaging of beta -adrenoceptors in a clinical setting. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Changes in NET have been recently reported in several cardiac failures. Therefore, a NET-specific radioligand is useful for in vivo assessment of changes in NET density in various cardiac disorders. Recently, we developed a radioiodinated reboxetine analogue, (2S,alpha S)-2-(alpha-(2-iodophenoxy)benzyl)morpholine ((S,S)-IPBM), for NET imaging. In the current study, we assessed the applicability of radioiodinated (S,S)-IPBM to NET imaging in the heart. Methods: The NET affinity and selectivity were measured from the ability to di splace specific [(3)H]nisoxetine and (S,S)-[(125)I]IPBM binding to rat heart membrane, respectively. To evaluate the distribution of (S,S)-[(125)I]IPBM in vivo, biodistribution experiment was performed in rats. With the use of several monoamine transporter binding agents, pharmacological blocking experiments were performed in rats. Results: In vitro binding assays showed that the affinity of (S,S)-IPBM to NET was similar to those of the well-known NET-specific binding agents, nisoxetine and desipramine. Furthermore, (S,S)-[(125)I]IPBM binding was inhibited by nisoxetine and desipramine, but not by dopamine or serotonin transporter binding agents. These data indicated that (S,S)-IPBM had high affinity and selectivity for NET in vitro. Biodistribution studies in rats showed rapid and high uptake of (S,S)-[(125)I]IPBM by the heart and rapid clearance from the blood. The heart-to-blood ratio was 31.9 at 180 min after the injection. The administration of nisoxetine and desipramine decreased (S,S)-[(125)I]IPBM accumulation in the heart, but injection of fluoxetine and GBR12909 had little influence. Conclusions: Radioiodinated (S,S)-IPBM is a potential radioligand for NET imaging in the heart. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

((S,S)-FMeNER) was labeled with fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min) by O-fluoromethylation of desfluoromethoxy-(S,S)-FMeNER with [F-18]bromofluoromethane. An analog, di-deuterated in the fluoromethoxy group ((SS)-FMeNER-D-2), was similarly labeled with di-deutero-[F-18]bromofluoromethane. These two new radioligands were obtained in radiochemical purities greater than 98% and with specific radioactivities ranging from 111-185 GBq/mumol at the end of synthesis (75 min). After intravenous injection of (SS)-[F-18]FMeNER into cynomolgus monkey, PET examination with the head in the field of view revealed skull-bound radioactivity, contaminating images of the brain, and indicated fast defluorination of the radioligand. Defluorination was much reduced in similar PET experiments with (SS)[F-18] FMeNER-D-2. Ratios of radioactivity in the lower brainstem, mesencephalon, thalamus, and temporal cortex to striatum obtained with (SS)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 at 160 min after i.v. injection were 1.5, 1.6, 1.3, and 1.5, respectively. In another PET experiment, pretreatment of the monkey with the selective NET inhibitor, desipramine, decreased the radioactivity ratios in all examined regions to near unity (e.g., to a ratio of 1.03 in mesencephalon). Labeled metabolites of (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 or (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER found in plasma were all more polar than the parent radioligand. In vitro autoradiography of(SS)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 on post-mortem human brain cryosections furthermore showed specific binding to NET in the locus coeruleus and thalamus. (SS)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 is the first useful radiofluorinated ligand for imaging brain NET in monkey in vivo and is superior to (SS)-[C-11]MeNER because a specific binding peak equilibrium is obtained during the PET experiment at a lower noise level.

Poor understanding of the underlying resistance mechanisms represents a key barrier to development of more effective RLT. We investigate the proteome and phosphoproteome in a mouse model of PCa to identify signaling adaptations triggered by PSMA RLT. Methods: Therapeutic efficacy of PSMA RLT was assessed by tumor volume measurements, time to progression, and survival in C4-2 or C4-2 TP53(-/-) tumor-bearing nonobese diabetic scid gamma-mice. Two days after RLT, the proteome and phosphoproteome were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Results: PSMA RLT significantly improved disease control in a dose-dependent manner. Proteome andphosphoproteomedatasets revealedactivationof genotoxic stress response pathways, including deregulation ofDNA damage/replication stress response, TP53, androgen receptor, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT, andMYCsignaling. C4-2TP53(-/-) tumorswere less sensitive to PSMARLT thanwereparental counterparts, supporting a role for TP53 inmediatingRLT responsiveness. Conclusion: Weidentified signaling alterations that may mediate resistance to PSMA RLT in a PCa mousemodel. Our data enable the development of rational synergistic RLT-combination therapies to improve outcomes for PCa patients.

A radioligand with high and specific affinity toward the high-affinity GHB binding site would be a unique tool toward a more complete understanding of this population of binding sites. With its high specific affinity and monocarboxylate transporter (MCT1) mediated transport across the blood-brain barrier in pharmacological doses, 3-hydroxycydopent-1-enecarboxylic acid (HOCPCA) seems like a suitable PET radiotracer candidate. Here, we report the C-11-labeling and subsequent evaluation of [C-11]HOCPCA in a domestic pig, as a PET-radioligand for visualization of the high-affinity GHB binding sites in the live pig brain. To investigate the regional binding of HOCPCA in pig brain prior to in vivo PET studies, in vitro quantitative autoradiography on sections of pig brain was performed using [H-3]HOCPCA. In vivo evaluation of [C-11]HOCPCA showed no brain uptake, possibly due to a limited uptake of HOCPCA by the MCT1 transporter at tracer doses of [C-11]HOCPCA.

Here, we investigated the TSPO radioligand [F-18]DPA-714 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cancer and inflammation. Procedures: [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging was performed in 8 mouse and rat models of breast and brain cancer and 4 mouse and rat models of muscular and bowel inflammation. Results: [F-18]DPA-714 showed different uptake levels in healthy organs and malignant tissues of mice and rats. Although high and displaceable [F-18]DPA-714 binding is observed ex vivo, TSPO-positive PET imaging of peripheral lesions of cancer and inflammation in mice did not show significant lesion-to-background signal ratios. Slower [F-18]DPA-714 metabolism and muscle clearance in mice compared to rats may explain the elevated background signal in peripheral organs in this species. Conclusion: Although TSPO is an evolutionary conserved protein, inter-and intra-species differences call for further exploration of the pharmacological parameters of TSPO radioligands.

The aim of this analysis was to investigate the prognostic implications of new FDG+/PSMA- lesions, which occur during or after PSMA RLT. In a retrospective bicentric analysis of 32 patients undergoing PSMA RLT and follow-up dual tracer staging with PSMA and FDG PET/CT, FDG+/PSMA- lesions occurred in a limited number of patients. However, the presence of FDG+/PSMA- lesions appears not to have a significant impact on the OS, but further studies are needed to establish the clinical relevance of such lesions. Introduction: Positron emission tomography/computer tomography (PET/CT) targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is crucial for the assessment of adequate PSMA expression in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) prior to PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA RLT). Moreover, initial dual tracer staging using combined PSMA and [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT provides relevant information, since discordant FDG-positive but PSMA-negative (FDG+/PSMA-) lesions constitute a negative prognostic marker of overall survival (OS) after PSMA RLT. However, little is known about the prognostic implications of dual tracer imaging for restaging at follow-up. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the prognostic implications of new FDG+/PSMA- lesions during or after PSMA RLT. Methods: This bicentric analysis included 32 patients with mCRPC who underwent both FDG and PSMA PET/CT imaging after two or four cycles of PSMA RLT. Patients with FDG+/PSMA- lesions prior to PSMA RLT were not considered. The presence of FDG+/PSMA- lesions was assessed with follow-up dual tracer imaging of patients after two or four cycles of PSMA RLT. Patients with at least one new FDG+/PSMA- lesion were compared to patients without any FDG+/PSMA- lesions at the respective time points. A log-rank analysis was used to assess the difference in OS between subgroups. Results: After two cycles of PSMA RLT, four of 32 patients (13%) had FDG+/PSMA- metastases. No significant difference in OS was observed (p = 0.807), as compared to patients without FDG+/PSMA- lesions. Follow-up dual tracer imaging after the 4th cycle of PSMA RLT was available in 18 patients. Of these, four patients presented with FDG+/PSMA- findings (n = 2 already after two cycles). After the fourth cycle of PSMA RLT, no significant difference in OS was observed between patients with and without FDG+/PSMA- lesions (p = 0.442). Conclusion: This study shows that FDG+/PSMA- lesions develop in a limited number of patients undergoing PSMA RLT. Further studies are needed to establish the clinical relevance of such lesions.

Current improvements in imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) have made it possible to map certain features of TBI-induced cellular and molecular changes equally in humans and animals. The PET imaging technique is an apt supplement to nanotheranostic-based treatment alternatives that are emerging to tackle TBI. The present study aims to investigate whether the two radioligands, [C-11]PBR28 and [F-18]flumazenil, are able to accurately quantify in vivo molecular-cellular changes in a rodent TBI-model for two different biochemical targets of the processes. In addition, it serves to observe any palpable variations associated with primary and secondary injury sites, and in the affected versus the contralateral hemispheres. As [C-11]PBR28 is a radioligand of the 18 kD translocator protein, the up-regulation of which is coupled to the level of neuroinflammation in the brain, and [F-18]flumazenil is a radioligand for GABA(A)-benzodiazepine receptors, whose level mirrors interneuronal activity and eventually cell death, the use of the two radioligands may reveal two critical features of TBI. An up-regulation in the [C-11]PBR28 uptake triggered by the LFP in the injured (right) hemisphere was noted on day 14, while the uptake of [F-18]flumazenil was down-regulated on day 14. When comparing the left (contralateral) and right (LFPI) hemispheres, the differences between the two in neuroinflammation were obvious. Our results demonstrate a potential way to measure the molecular alterations in a rodent-based TBI model using PET imaging with [C-11]PBR28 and [F-18]flumazenil. These radioligands are promising options that can be eventually used in exploring the complex in vivo pharmacokinetics and delivery mechanisms of nanoparticles in TBI treatment.

Phosphodiesterase 10A PET Radioligand Development Program: From Pig to Human	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; PDE10A; C-11; in vivo; brain	IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; THERAPEUTIC APPROACH; INHIBITORS; PDE10A; RADIOSYNTHESIS; CAMP; RAT	Four novel phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) PET tracers have been synthesized, characterized in preclinical studies, and compared with the previously reported C-11-MP-10. Methods: On the basis of in vitro data, IMA102, IMA104, IMA107, and IMA106 were identified as potential PDE10A radioligand candidates and labeled with either C-11 via N-methylation or with F-18 through an S(N)2 reaction, in the case of IMA102. These candidates were compared with 11C-MP-10 in pilot in vivo studies in the pig brain. On the basis of these data, C-11-IMA106 and C-11-IMA107 were taken into further evaluation and comparison with C-11-MP-10 in the primate brain. Finally, the most promising radioligand candidate was progressed into human evaluation. Results: All 5 tracers were produced with good radiochemical yield and specific activity. All candidates readily entered the brain and demonstrated a heterogeneous distribution consistent with the known expression of PDE10A. Baseline PET studies in the pig and baboon showed that C-11-IMA107 and C-11-MP-10 displayed the most favorable tissue kinetics and imaging properties. The administration of selective PDE10A inhibitors reduced the binding of C-11-IMA107 and C-11-MP-10 in the PDE10A-rich brain regions, in a dose-dependent manner. In the nonhuman primate brain, the tissue kinetics of C-11-IMA107 and C-11-MP-10 were well described by a 2-tissue-compartment model, allowing robust estimates of the regional total volume of distribution. Blockade with unlabeled MP-10 confirmed the suitability of the cerebellum as a reference tissue and enabled the estimation of regional binding potential as the outcome measure of specific binding. Conclusion: C-11-IMA107 was identified as the ligand with the highest binding potential while still possessing reversible kinetics. The first human administration of C-11-IMA107 has demonstrated the expected regional distribution and suitably fast kinetics, indicating that C-11-IMA107 will be a useful tool for the investigation of PDE10A status in the living human brain.

Use of the H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist radioligand [<SUP>3</SUP>H]-A-349821 to reveal <i>in vivo</i> receptor occupancy of cognition enhancing H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						ABT-239; histamine; H-3 receptor; H-3 receptor antagonist; radiotracer; H-3 receptor antagonist radioligand; [H-3]-A-349821; receptor occupancy; five-trial inhibitory avoidance	SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE-RAT; POTENTIAL PET LIGAND; EX-VIVO; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; HISTAMINE; BRAIN; BINDING; BIODISTRIBUTION; AUTORADIOGRAPHY; RADIOSYNTHESIS	The histamine H-3 receptor antagonist radioligand [H-3]-A-349821 was characterized as a radiotracer for assessing in vivo receptor occupancy by H-3 receptor antagonists that affect behaviour. This model was established as an alternative to ex vivo binding methods, for relating antagonist H-3 receptor occupancy to blood levels and efficacy in preclinical models. In vivo cerebral cortical H-3 receptor occupancy by [H-3]-A-349821 was determined in rats from differences in [H-3]-A-349821 levels in the isolated cortex and cerebellum, a brain region with low levels of H-3 receptors. Comparisons were made to relate antagonist H-3 receptor occupancy to blood levels and efficacy in a preclinical model of cognition, the five-trial inhibitory avoidance response in rat pups. In adult rats, [H-3]-A-349821, 1.5 mu g.kg(-1), penetrated into the brain and cleared more rapidly from cerebellum than cortex; optimally, [H-3]-A-349821 levels were twofold higher in the latter. With increasing [H-3]-A-349821 doses, cortical H-3 receptor occupancy was saturable with a binding capacity consistent with in vitro binding in cortex membranes. In studies using tracer [H-3]-A-349821 doses, ABT-239 and other H-3 receptor antagonists inhibited H-3 receptor occupancy by [H-3]-A-349821 in a dose-dependent manner. Blood levels of the antagonists corresponding to H-3 receptor occupancy were consistent with blood levels associated with efficacy in the five-trial inhibitory avoidance response. When employed as an occupancy radiotracer, [H-3]-A-349821 provided valid measurements of in vivo H-3 receptor occupancy, which may be helpful in guiding and interpreting clinical studies of H-3 receptor antagonists.

AZD2184: a radioligand for sensitive detection of β-amyloid deposits	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						beta-amyloid; Alzheimers; imaging; plaques; positron emisson tomography	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PLAQUES; BINDING; PROTEIN; TRACER; MEMORY; BRAIN; PIB	The presence of beta-amyloid plaques in brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and serves as a biomarker for confirmation of diagnosis postmortem. Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands such as Pittsburgh compound B ([C-11]-2-(3-fluoro-4-methylamino-phenyl)-benzothiazol-6-ol) (PIB) binds selectively to beta-amyloid and are promising new tools supporting the clinical diagnoses of AD. In addition, such methodology may be useful for evaluation of new drugs aiming at reduction of amyloid plaque load. The objective of this study is to develop a new amyloid selective PET radioligand with higher signal-to-background ratio when compared with existing amyloid PET ligands. The lead compound, AZD2184, (2-[6-(methylamino)pyridin-3-yl]-1,3-benzothiazol-6-ol) was found to have high affinity for amyloid fibrils in vitro (K-d: 8.4 +/- 1.0 nM). Two minutes after i.v. administration in rats, about 1% of the dose was in brain. In vitro autoradiography on cortical brain sections from amyloid-beta precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) mice and AD patients showed that while [H-3]AZD2184 and [H-3]PIB are mutually displaceable, [H-3]AZD2184 displays a higher signal-to-background ratio primarily by virtue of lower background binding levels. The ratio of binding ability in prefrontal cortex (high plaque load) to subcortical white matter (background) was 4.5 for [H-3]AZD2184 and 0.8 for [H-3]PIB at 1 nM. In adjacent cortical sections from APP/PS1 mouse as well as from AD cortical tissue, [H-3]AZD2184 and antibodies to human beta-amyloid labeled identical structures. In vivo administration of [H-3]AZD2184 to APP/PS1 mice further showed that [H-3]AZD2184 labels amyloid deposits with low non-specific background binding. Taken together, the pre-clinical profile of AZD2184 in relation to the reference ligand PIB, suggests that C-11-labeled AZD2184 is a potential radioligand for PET-visualization of beta-amyloid deposits in the living human brain.

In order to assess the suitability of a radioiodinated analogue of the D4-selective ligand FAUC 113 for tracer studies in vivo, we investigated the in-vivo stability, biodistribution and brain-uptake of 7-I-131-FAUC 113 in Sprague-Dawley rats. Methods: Radiolabelling was carried out with high radiochemical yield and specific activity. After intravenous injection, blood and tissue samples, taken at designated time intervals, were collected for analysis. Analyses of metabolites were performed by radio-hplc and radio-tlc. For in-vivo evaluation, sagittal cryo-sections of the rat brain were investigated by in-vitro and ex-vivo autoradiography on a /j-lmager system. Results: 7-I-131-FAUC 113 was rapidly cleared from blood. Highest uptake was observed in kidney (0.603 +/- 0.047% ID/g, n = 4) and liver (0.357 +/- 0.070% ID/g, n = 4) at 10min p.i.; 7-I-131- FAUC 113 displayed rapid uptake (0.21-0.26% ID/g) and fast clearance in various brain regions consistent with the determined logP-volue of 2.36 +/- 0.15 (n = 4). In-vivostabilityof 7-I-131-FAUC 113 was confirmed in the frontal cortex(> 95%). Ex-vivo autoradiography revealed a frontal cortex-to-cerebellum ratio of 1.57 +/- 0.13 at 10 min p.i. (n = 6). Coinjection with L-750667 could not suppress any putative specific binding of 7-I-131-FAUC 113. In-vitro outoradiogrophy using authentic 7-iodo-FAUC 113 or L-750667 failed to cause significant displacement of the radioligand. Conclusions: Radioiodinated FALIC 113 does not allow imaging of D4 receptors in the rat brain in vivo nor in vitro. Further work should aim at the development of selective dopamine D4 radioligands with improved tracer characteristics, such as receptor affinity and subtype selectivity, specific activity or blood-brain-barrier permeability.

This is the least well-defined adenosine receptor subtype, and A(2B) antagonists have potential as antiasthmatic drugs. For use as a radioligand, MRS 1754, a p-cyanoanilide xanthine derivative, was tritiated on the propyl groups in a two-step reaction using a p-carboxamido precursor, which was dehydrated to the cyano species using trifluoroacetic anhydride. [H-3]MRS 1754 (150 Ci/mmol) bound to recombinant human A(2B) adenosine receptors in membranes of stably transfected HEK-293 cells. Specific binding was saturable, competitive, and followed a one-site model, with a K-D value of 1.13 +/- 0.12 nM and a B-max value of 10.9 +/- 0.6 pmol/mg protein. Specific binding utilizing 0.7 nM [H-3]MRS 1754 was > 70% of total binding. The affinity calculated from association and dissociation binding constants was 1.22 nM (N = 4). Binding to membranes expressing rat and human A(1) and A(3), adenosine receptors was not significant, and binding in membranes of HEK-293 cells expressing human A(2A) receptors was of low affinity (K-D > 50 nM). The effects of cations and chelators were explored. Specific binding was constant over a pH range of 4.5 to 6.5, with reduced binding at higher pH. The pharmacological profile in competition experiments with [H-3]MRS 1754 was consistent with the structure-activity relationship for agonists and antagonists at A(2B) receptors. The K-i values of XAC (xanthine amine congener) and CPX (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-diproplylxanthine) were 16 and 55 nM, respectively. NECA (5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) competed for [H-3]MRS 1754 binding with a K-i of 570 nM, similar to its potency in functional assays. Thus, [H-3]MRS 1754 is suitable as a selective, high-affinity radioligand for A(2B) receptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

This study demonstrated that while auto radiographic methods provided anatomic precision and regional resolution, the homogenate binding method for site occupancy assessment yielded comparable sensitivity with markedly improved throughput. For ex vivo binding assays, the reduction of temperature and time during the in vitro process (primarily incubation with a radioligand) markedly decreased the dissociation of test agents from binding sites in brain tissues. This reduction, in turn, minimized the potential for underestimation of site occupancy in vivo especially for test compounds with affinity > 10 nM. The ratios of measured occupancy ED50 values (doses at which 50% occupancy occurs) among SERT, NET and DAT sites for duloxetine, venlafaxine, nomifensine, indatraline, DOV 21,947 and DOV 216,303 were consistent with the ratios of the in vitro affinities between these target binding sites. The biological relevance of the monoamine transporter occupancy for these compounds is discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The cocaine and tricyclic antidepressant-sensitive NET belongs to a family of sodium and chloride coupled transporters that include the monoamines dopamine and serotonin and the amino acids GABA and glycine. The regional distribution of the NET has been defined by synaptosomal uptake of norepinephrine and by autoradiographic approaches in rodent and primate brain. However, the NET has not been well characterized in the human brain due to the overall low abundance of protein expressed in axon terminals. Recently, immunolocalization studies have been used to identify the regional distribution of the cytoplasmic NET epitope in rodent brain. We report here on the characteristics of drug interactions with the native NET protein in human postmortem brain. Antisera raised against a 17-amino acid peptide from the N-terminus of the hNET recognized an 80 kDa species in human cerebral cortex. Chronic exposure to cocaine upregulated NET protein expression and [H-3]nisoxetine binding sites in the insular cortex from brains of cocaine addicts. These results demonstrate that immunologic and radioligand binding approaches afford specific labeling of the native transport protein in postmortem human brain. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

They offer precise tumor targeting with a favorable efficacy-to-toxicity profile. Specifically, the kidneys, once regarded as the critical organ for radiation toxicity, also show excellent tolerance to radiation doses as high as 50-60 Gy in selected cases. However, the number of nephrons that form the structural and functional units of the kidney is determined before birth and is fixed. Thus, loss of nephrons secondary to any injury may lead to an irreversible decline in renal function over time. Our primary understanding of radiation-induced nephropathy is derived from the effects of external beam radiation on the renal tissue. With the growing adoption of radionuclide therapies, considerable evidence has been gained with regard to the occurrence of renal toxicity and its associated risk factors. In this review, we discuss the radionuclide therapies associated with the risk of nephrotoxicity, the present understanding of the factors and mechanisms that contribute to renal injury, and the current and potential methods for preventing, identifying, and managing nephrotoxicity, specifically acute onset nephropathies.

We previously identified a sigma(1) ligand TZ3108 having highly potent (Ki-sigma 1 = 0.48 nM) and selective affinity for sigma(1) versus sigma(2) receptors. TZ3108 was F-18-labeled for in vivo evaluation. Biodistribution and blocking studies of [F-18]TZ3108 in male Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated high brain uptake, which was sigma(1)-specific with no in vivo defluorination. MicroPET studies in cynomolgus macaques showed high brain penetration of [F-18]TZ3108; the regional brain distribution was consistent with that of the s1 receptor. Pseudo-equilibrium in the brain was reached similar to 45 min post-injection. Metabolite analysis of [F-18]TZ3108 in NHP blood and rodent blood and brain revealed that similar to 70% parent remained in the plasma of NHPs 60 min post-injection and the major radiometabolite did not cross the blood-brain barrier in rats. In summary, the potent, selective and metabolically stable sigma(1) specific radioligand [F-18]TZ3108 represents a potentially useful PET radioligand for quantifying the sigma(1) receptor in the brain.

These regions included the thalamus, amygdala, pituitary, temporal cortex and frontal cortex as well as putamen, caudate and ventral striatum. The positron emission tomography (PET) studies involved control studies, which extended to 3 h, and the amphetamine-challenge studies, which involved administration of d-amphetamine (approx. 0.5-1 mg/kg, i.v.). PET data analysis employed the distribution volume ratio method (DVR) in which the cerebellum was used as a reference region. Our results show a substantial decrease in the binding potential of F-18-fallypride in extrastriatal regions: thalamus (-20%), amygdala (-39%) and pituitary (-14%). Putamen, caudate and ventral striatum also exhibited significant decreases (-20%). The decrease in 18F-fallypride binding in the extrastriatal regions points to the importance of dopaminergic neurotransmission in these brain regions. Furthermore, our findings support the use of 18F-fallypride to measure extrastriatal dopamine release. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

OTA efficiently displaced the high affinity, selective oxytocin receptor (OXTR) radioligand, I-125-labeled ornithine vasotocin analog (I-125-OVTA), but was much less effective at displacing the selective V1a vasopressin receptor radioligand, I-125-labeled linear vasopressin, thus showing high affinity and selectivity of OTA for rabbit OXTR as in rodents. Further, ICV OTA injections did not modify nest-building, latency to enter the nest box, time spent nursing or the amount of milk produced, relative to vehicle-injected does. The percentage of mothers suckling the litter was also similar between both groups, regardless of parity. Together, our results do not support a role of OXT for the initiation or maintenance of rabbit maternal behavior. Future studies are warranted to determine if OXT participates in fine-tuning additional aspects of the maternal ethogram, for example, circadian periodicity of nursing and nest defense.

Objectives To examine brain glial activation and systemic immune dysfunction in people with FRDA and quantify their relationship with symptom severity, duration, and onset age. Methods Fifteen individuals with FRDA and 13 healthy controls underwent brain positron emission tomography using the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [F-18]-FEMPA, a marker of glial activation, together with the quantification of blood plasma inflammatory cytokines. Results [F-18]-FEMPA binding was significantly increased in the dentate nuclei (d = 0.67), superior cerebellar peduncles (d = 0.74), and midbrain (d = 0.87), alongside increased plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) (d = 0.73), in individuals with FRDA compared to controls. Increased [F-18]-FEMPA binding in the dentate nuclei, brainstem, and cerebellar anterior lobe correlated with earlier age of symptom onset (controlling for the genetic triplet repeat expansion length; all r(part) < -0.6), and in the pons and anterior lobe with shorter disease duration (r = -0.66; -0.73). Conclusions Neuroinflammation is evident in brain regions implicated in FRDA neuropathology. Increased neuroimmune activity may be related to earlier disease onset and attenuate over the course of the illness.

Biol. Chem. 276 (2001) 12345]. While evaluating the effects of various protease inhibitors on agonist-induced opioid receptor down regulation, we observed that while the peptide aldehyde, leupeptin (acetyl-L-Leucyl-L-Leucyl-L-Arginal), did not affect agonist-induced down regulation, leupeptin at submillimolar concentrations directly inhibited radioligand binding to opioid receptors. In this study, the inhibitory activity of leupeptin on radioligand binding was characterized utilizing human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell lines expressing transfected mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors. The rank order of potency for leupeptin inhibition of [H-3]bremazocine binding to opioid receptors was mu>delta>kappa. In contrast to the effect of leupeptin, the peptide aldehyde proteasome inhibitor, MG 132 (carbobenzoxy-L-Leucyl-L-Leucyl-L-Leucinal), had significantly less effect on bremazocine binding to mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors. We propose that leupeptin inhibits ligand binding by reacting reversibly with essential sulfhydryl groups that are necessary for high-affinity ligand/raceptor interactions.

A considerable number of diabetics who do not reach the insulin-dependent stage have this antibody. Recently, type 1 diabetes has been thought to be caused by T helper 1 (Th1)-type autoimmunity based on studies in non-obese diabetic mice, but it is still difficult to investigate antigen-specific T-cell function in human type 1 diabetes. We therefore assessed an IgG subclass assay for GADA, which should reflect T-helper function against GAD. Sera from 14 type 1 diabetic patients positive for GADA by radioligand binding assay were tested for the IgG subclass of GADA. The assay was based on an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, which showed a good correlation with radioligand binding assay. The sera of all but one of the 14 type 1 diabetic patients (93%) were positive for the IgG1 subclass of GADA. The IgG2 and IgG3 subclasses of GADA were also detected in one diabetic patient each who were also positive for IgG1. The IgG4 subclass was not detected in any of the sera we tested. We concluded that IgG1 is the dominant subclass of GADA in Japanese type 1 diabetic patients.

Normal organs, including the liver and salivary glands, exhibit physiological PSMA-ligand accumulation and have, therefore, gained interest as decisive landmarks for the semiquantitative classification of tumoral uptake on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging. The presented study aims to assess the change in uptake to reference organs, including the liver, parotid and salivary glands after radioligand therapy (RLT) with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in relation to pretreatment imaging metrics. This study aims to assess the change in uptake to reference organs, including the liver, parotid and salivary glands after radioligand therapy (RLT) with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in relation to pretreatment imaging metrics. Eighty-five patients with mCRPC underwent [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging prior to (pre RLT PET) and after (post RLT PET) a median of 3 (IQR 2-6) RLT cycles with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. PSMA-positive tumor burden was stratified into 4 groups based on modified PROMISE criteria (oligofocal, multifocal, disseminated, diffuse). Uptake (SUVmean, SUVmax) in liver tissue, parotid and submandibular glands was measured. A control group was established with 54 patients who had received two separate PET acquisitions following the same protocol (PET1, PET2) within 12 months for localized or oligofocal prostate cancer without RLT in the interim. Baseline uptake values (SUVmean, SUVmax) in parotid (10.8 & PLUSMN; 3.2, 16.8 & PLUSMN; 5.4) and submandibular glands (11.3 & PLUSMN; 2.8, 18.1 & PLUSMN; 4.7) are 2-fold compared to liver uptake (4.9 & PLUSMN; 1.4, 7.7 & PLUSMN; 2.0), with no significant change between PET 1 and PET 2 in the control group. In the RLT group, increasing tumor burden class is significantly associated with decreasing uptake in the liver (p = 0.013), parotid (p < 0.001) and submandibular glands (p < 0.001); this tumor sink effect by respective tumor burden is widely maintained after RLT (p = 0.011, p < 0.001, p < 0.001). RLT has a significant impact on salivary gland uptake with decreasing values per patient in all groups of disease burden change (up to -30.4% in submandibular glands, p < 0.001), while liver tissue shows rising values in patients with declining tumor burden throughout RLT (+18.6%, p = 0.020). Uptake in liver tissue and salivary glands on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging is inversely related to tumor burden prior to and following RLT with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Per patient, salivary gland uptake is further reduced throughout RLT independently from tumor burden, while changes in liver uptake remain burden-dependent. Liver and salivary gland uptake-derived metrics and segmentation thresholds may thus be of limited value when used as reference for response assessment to RLT.

In this study we investigated if radioligands derived from lysine-urea-2-aminoadipic acid (Lys-urea-Aad), lysine-urea-S-carboxylmethylcysteine (Lys-urea-Cmc) and lysine-urea-O-carboxylmethylserine (Lys-urea-Cms) pharmacophores with/without an albumin binder could retain good PSMA-targeting capability but with minimized kidney and salivary gland uptake. Methods: HTK03177 and HTK03187 were obtained by replacing Aad in the previously reported Lys-urea-Aad-derived HTK03149 with Cmc and Cms, respectively. HTK03170, HTK04048 and HTK04028 were derived from HTK03149, HTK03177 and HTK03187, respectively, with the conjugation of an albumin-binding moiety, 4-(p-methoxyphenyl)butyric acid. In vitro competition binding assays were conducted using PSMA-expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells and [F-18]DCFPyL as the radioligand. Imaging and biodistribution studies of Ga-68-labeled HTK03177 and HTK03187, and Lu-177-labeled HTK03170, HTK04048 and HTK04028 were performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. Radioligand therapy study of [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03170 was carried out in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 was used for comparison. Results: The calculated Ki(PSMA) values of Ga-HTK03177, Ga-HTK03187, Lu-HTK03170, Lu-HTK04048 and Lu-HTK04028 were 5.0 +/- 2.4, 10.6 +/- 2.0, 1.6 +/- 0.4, 1.4 +/- 1.0 and 13.9 +/- 3.2 nM, respectively. PET Imaging and biodistribution studies at 1 h post-injection showed that both [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03177 and [68Ga]Ga-HTK03187 had high uptake in LNCaP tumor xenografts (24.7 +/- 6.85 and 21.1 +/- 3.62 %ID/g, respectively) but minimal uptake in normal organs/tissues including kidneys (7.76 +/- 1.00 and 2.83 +/- 0.45 %ID/g, respectively) and salivary glands (0.22 +/- 0.02 and 0.16 +/- 0.02 %ID/g, respectively). SPECT imaging and biodistribution studies showed that the LNCaP tumor uptake of Lu-177-labeled HTK03170, HTK04048 and HTK04028 peaked at 4-24 h post-injection at similar to 43-65 %ID/g and was relatively sustained over time. Their peaked average uptake in kidneys (<= 17.4 %ID/g) and salivary glands (<= 2.92 %ID/g) was lower and continuously reduced over time. Radioligand therapy study showed that compared with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (37 MBq), a quarter dose of [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03170 (9.3 MBq) led to a better median survival (63 vs 90 days). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that that Lys-urea-Aad, Lys-urea-Cmc and Lys-urea-Cms are promising pharmacophores for the design of PSMA-targeted radioligands especially for radiotherapeutic applications to minimize toxicity to kidneys and salivary glands.

Integrin alpha v beta 6 plays a key role in fibrogenesis by activating transforming growth factor-beta. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with a fluorine-18 radiolabelled alpha v beta 6 radioligand, [F-18]-FBA-A20FMDV2, were performed to assess uptake, and the relationship to RT dose parameters was explored. Methods and Materials: Recently treated non-small cell lung cancer patients (<6 months after RT) had [F-18]-FBA-A20FMDV2-PET scans, coregistered with the RT planning computed tomography and segmented to RT doses of >40 Gy (excluding tumor), 25 to 40 Gy, 15 to 25 Gy, 8 to 15 Gy, and <8 Gy. PET uptake (standardized uptake value; SUV) corrected for tissue density between 10 and 60 minutes (SUV10-60) was calculated and compared with RT dose, dose per fraction, and biological effective dose (BED). PET uptake was also evaluated in healthy volunteers. Results: Six non-small cell lung cancer (3 male; 3 female) subjects scanned between 6 and 22 weeks after RT and 6 healthy volunteers (3 males; 3 females) were evaluated. Higher mean PET uptake (SUV10-60) was observed in the irradiated lung compared with the healthy lung (2.97 vs 1.99; P < .05). A significant and positive pharmacodynamic relationship was observed between radioligand uptake (SUV10-60) and dose per RT fraction (r(2) = 0.63; P < .001) and with BED for fibrosis (r(2) = 0.38; P < .001 for alpha/beta 3 Gy and r(2) = 0.33; P < 0.001 for alpha/beta 5 Gy). Conclusions: Higher uptake in the irradiated lung and a pharmacodynamic relationship between alpha v beta 6 radioligand uptake versus RT dose per fraction and BED for lung fibrosis is consistent with RT induced activation of alpha v beta 6 integrin and supports a role for alpha v beta 6 in the induction of lung fibrosis after pulmonary RT. alpha v beta 6-PET imaging may potentially aid in the assessment and management of radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.

To date, only 1 tracer, the KOR agonist C-11-GR103545, has been reported to be able to image KOR in primates. The goal of the present study was to synthesize the selective KOR antagonist C-11-LY2795050 and evaluate its potential as a PET tracer to image KOR in vivo. Methods: The in vitro binding affinity of LY2795050 was measured in radioligand competition binding assays. Ex vivo experiments were conducted using microdosing of the unlabeled ligand in Sprague-Dawley rats and in wild-type and KOR knockout mice, to assess the ligand's potential as a tracer candidate. Imaging experiments with C-11-LY2795050 in monkeys were performed on the Focus-220 scanner with arterial blood input function measurement. Binding parameters were determined with kinetic modeling analysis. Results: LY2795050 displays full antagonist activity and high binding affinity and selectivity for KOR. Microdosing studies in rodents and ex vivo analysis of tissue concentrations with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified LY2795050 as an appropriate tracer candidate able to provide specific binding signals in vivo. C-11-LY2795050 was prepared in an average yield of 12% and greater than 99% radiochemical purity. In rhesus monkeys, C-11-LY2795050 displayed a moderate rate of peripheral metabolism, with approximately 40% of parent compound remaining at 30 min after injection. In the brain, C-11-LY2795050 displayed fast uptake kinetics (regional activity peak times of,20 min) and an uptake pattern consistent with the distribution of KOR in primates. Pretreatment with naloxone (1 mg/kg, intravenously) resulted in a uniform distribution of radioactivity. Further, specific binding of C-11-LY2795050 was reduced by the selective KOR antagonist LY2456302 in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: C-11-LY2795050 displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties and binding profiles in vivo and therefore is a suitable ligand for imaging the KOR in primates. This newly developed KOR antagonist tracer has since been advanced to PET imaging of KOR in humans and constitutes the first successful KOR antagonist radiotracer.

Poor Outcomes for Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer with Low Prostate-specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) Expression Deemed Ineligible for <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-labelled PSMA Radioligand Therapy	EUROPEAN UROLOGY ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Prostate cancer; Metastatic; Castration resistant; Radionuclide therapy; Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Fluorodeoxyglucose; Theranostics; Survival	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SURVIVAL; LU-177-PSMA-617; CHEMOTHERAPY; ENZALUTAMIDE; PREDNISONE; SAFETY; MEN	Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPG) and represents a target for imaging and therapy. We undertook a prospective trial of Lu-17(7) PSMA 617 radioligand therapy in men with high PSMA expression who progressed after standard therapies. Objective: To determine outcomes for men screened for the trial but not treated because of low PSMA expression. Design, setting, and participants: Patients screened with Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography in a prospective trial. Patients ineligible for enrolment with low PSMA expression or FDG-positive PSMA-negative (discordant FDG-avid) disease were assessed. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Subsequent treatments received were recorded. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine overall survival from date of screening. Results and limitations: Sixteen patients (24%) had low PSMA expression (n = 8) or discordant FDG-avid disease (n = 8). The median prostate-specific antigen doubling-time was 2.1 mo. Eleven patients had Gleason >= 8 disease. All patients had previously progressed after docetaxel, 44% after cabazitaxel, and 94% after abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. Nine patients had subsequent systemic antitumour treatment. Fifteen patients died, with median OS of 2.5 mo (95% confidence interval 1.7-5.0). Study limitations include uncertainty for imaging thresholds that define low PSMA expression. It is also possible that theranostic therapy could have improved survival in this cohort. Conclusions: Low PSMA expression or discordant FDG-avid disease in patients with mCRPC who progress after conventional therapies identifies a group with poor prognosis and short survival. Patient summary: The Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand may be an effective therapy for patients with advanced prostate cancer who progress after standard therapies. In this report we looked at outcomes for patients who were not eligible for this novel therapy on the basis of low prostate-specific membrane antigen uptake on screening positron emission tomography scans. We found that their outcomes were poor, with short survival. (C) 2018 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is often associated with activated microglia, which would overexpress 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). In this study, we successfully developed a new TSPO radioligand, [F-18]-2-(4-fluoro-2-(p-tolyloxy)phenyl)-1,2-dihydroisoquinolin-3(4H)-one ([F-18]FTPQ), and evaluate its potential to noninvasively detect brain changes in a rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD). Procedures The precursor (8) for [F-18]FTPQ preparation was synthesized via six steps. Radiofluorination was carried out in the presence of a copper catalyst, and the crude product was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to give the desired [F-18]FTPQ. The rat model of PD was established by the injection of 6-OHDA into the right hemisphere of male 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. MicroPET/CT imaging and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed to characterize the biological properties of [F-18]FTPQ. Results The overall chemical yield for the precursor (8) was around 14% after multi-step synthesis. The radiofluorination efficiency of [F-18]FTPQ was 60 +/- 5%. After HPLC purification, the radiochemical purity was higher than 98%. The overall radiochemical yield was approximately 19%. The microPET/CT images demonstrated apparent striatum accumulation in the brains of PD rats at the first 30 min after intravenous injection of [F-18]FTPQ. Besides, longitudinal imaging found the uptake of [F-18]FTPQ in the brain may reflect the severity of PD. The radioactivity accumulated in the ipsilateral hemisphere of PD rats at 1, 2, and 3 weeks after 6-OHDA administration was 1.84 +/- 0.26, 3.43 +/- 0.45, and 5.58 +/- 0.72%ID/mL, respectively. IHC revealed that an accumulation of microglia/macrophages and astrocytes in the 6-OHDA-injected hemisphere. Conclusions In this study, we have successfully synthesized [F-18]FTPQ with acceptable radiochemical yield and demonstrated the feasibility of [F-18]FTPQ as a TSPO radioligand for the noninvasive monitoring the disease progression of PD.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and to identify parameters predicting outcome in mCRPC patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617. Methods Between December 2014 and January 2017, 59 consecutive patients (median age 72 years; interquartile range, (IQR, 66-76 years) with mCRPC, who had been treated with at least one next-generation antihormonal drug as well as chemotherapy, were included in this study. Biochemical response was evaluated using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. Survival was evaluated using KaplanMeier estimates and Cox regression proportional hazards model. Toxicity was assessed using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE). The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Results The 59 patients were treated with a total of 159 cycles (median 3 cycles, range 1-7) of Lu-177-PSMA-617 (median dose 6.11 GBq, IQR 5.9-6.3 GBq). The median follow-up was 24 weeks (IQR 15-36 weeks). Follow-up data for at least 12 weeks (PCWG3) were available in 76% (45) of the patients. For outcome results data from all patients treated with at least one cycle were analysed. A decline in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of = 50% occurred in 53%, and a decline in PSA of any amount in 91% of patients. The estimated median OS was 32 weeks. An initial alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level < 220 U/L and a PSA decline after the first cycle were associated with a longer OS (56 vs. 28 weeks, p < 0.01, and 56 vs. 29 weeks, p = 0.04, respectively). The median estimated PSA progression-free survival (PPFS) was 18 weeks. Only ALP level < 220 U/L was significantly associated with a longer PPFS (41 vs. 18 weeks, p < 0.01). Conclusions A PSA decline after the first cycle of (177)LuPSMA-617 and an initial ALP level < 220 U/L were predictors of a longer OS in patients with end-stage mCRPC. An ALP level < 220 U/L was additionally associated with a longer PPFS.

J	Meyers, NL; Hickling, RI				Meyers, Nicholas L.; Hickling, Roger I.			Pharmacology and metabolism of renzapride - A novel therapeutic agent for the potential treatment of irritable bowel syndrome	DRUGS IN R&D			English	Article							RECEPTOR SPLICE VARIANT; 5-HT4 RECEPTOR; DOPAMINE-RECEPTOR; GUINEA-PIG; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-CLONING; HIGH-AFFINITY; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VITRO	Background and objective: Renzapride (ATL-1251), a novel benzamide, is currently under clinical development for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Previous in vitro and in vivo experimental studies have characterized renzapride as a full serotonin 5-HT4 receptor agonist on the gut and a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. Clinical studies have confirmed the therapeutic efficacy, tolerability and safety of renzapride in patients with constipation-predominant IBS. This study set out to characterize the pharmacological profile of renzapride and its potential metabolic products at both 5-HT and other monoamine receptors in the gut. Methods: The affinity of renzapride, its (+) and (-) enantiomers, and its primary metabolite, renzapride N-oxide and its enantiomers, for serotonin receptors was assessed by means of in vitro radioligand binding inhibition studies. After membranes prepared from animal tissue or membranes of cell lines transfected with cloned human receptors had been incubated with radiolabelled ligand with high affinity for a specific receptor, renzapride was added to competitively inhibit this binding. Levels of bound radioligand were measured by filtration and counting of the bound radioactivity. In instances where >50% inhibition of radioligand binding had occurred, the inhibition constant (K-i) was calculated. Metabolism of renzapride by liver microsomes was assessed by incubating 10 mu mol/L renzapride with human liver microsome samples for 60 minutes at 37 degrees C. After the reaction was stopped, the samples were centrifuged and the supernatant analysed for metabolites by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The potential inhibitory effects of renzapride on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes were assessed by incubating renzapride at various concentrations over a 1-500 mu mol/L concentration range with microsomes genetically engineered to express a single CYP. Results: Renzapride was selective for serotonergic receptors and, in particular, had high affinity for human 5-HT3 and guinea-pig 5-HT4 receptors (K-i 17 and 477 rim, respectively): Inhibitory properties at 5-HT2B receptors were also identified for renzapride, as well as some affinity for 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Renzapride N-oxide and its enantiomers demonstrated much lower affinity for all 5-HT receptors compared with renzapride. Renzapride was metabolized by liver microsomes to a limited extent and there was no significant non-microsomal metabolism of renzapride. Renzapride did not inhibit the major CYP drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2136, CYPIA2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP3A4 at concentrations consistent with use in a clinical setting. Conclusions: These results confirm and extend earlier studies in animal and human receptors that show renzapride is a, potent and generally full 5-HT4 receptor agonist and 5-HT3 receptor antagonist. The results reported in the present study indicate that the metabolites of renzapride are minor and are unlikely to contribute to its therapeutic profile or lead to interaction of renzapride with other drugs that inhibit the major drug-metabolizing enzymes in the liver at therapeutic doses. These data contribute to the understanding of the pharmacological actions and metabolic fate of renzapride in vivo.

In vitro and in vivo metabolism studies showed that the two radioligands were resistant to reductive metabolism, probably due to the presence of a pyrazole ring. In cellular uptake studies, [F-18]1 and [F-18]2 exhibited comparable uptake by human umbilical vascular endothelial cells and rat C6 glioma cells. Inhibition of radioligand uptake to a similar extent by HC and curcumin suggests that these radioligands may share the same binding sites as those for HC and curcumin. Positron emission tomography imaging of C6 glioma xenografted mice acquired 30 and 60 min after radioligand injection showed that [F-18]2 had markedly higher tumor uptake than [F-18]1, which was consistent with biodistribution data (3.20 +/- 0.35% ID per g vs. 0.98 +/- 0.31% ID per g, respectively). However, the two radioligands showed similar levels of tumor-to-background uptake ratio, except for the significantly higher uptake of [F-18]1 by the small intestine, indicating its more rapid clearance. The results of this study will guide further structural modifications of these radioligands to enhance tumor-to-background uptake ratios.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human mu-opioid receptor gene (OPRM1) can underlie altered behavioral responses to opioids. Therefore, we hypothesized that the primary structure of the NMR MOR may differ from other species. Sequencing of the NMR oprm1 revealed strong homology to other mammals, but exposed three unique amino acids that might affect receptor-ligand interactions. The NMR and rat oprm1 sequences were cloned into mammalian expression vectors and transfected into HEK293 cells. Radioligand binding and 3'-5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) enzyme immunoassays were used to compare opioid binding and opioid-mediated cAMP inhibition. At normalized opioid receptor protein levels we detected significantly lower [3H]DAMGO binding to NMR compared to rat MOR, but no significant difference in DAMGO-induced cAMP inhibition. Strong DAMGO-induced MOR internalization was detectable using radioligand binding and confocal imaging in HEK293 cells expressing rat or NMR receptor, while morphine showed weak or no effects. In summary, we found minor functional differences between rat and NMR MOR suggesting that other differences e. g. in anatomical distribution of MOR underlie the NMR's extreme reaction to opioids.

The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by micro, spectral and X-ray analysis. Analgesic activity of the compounds was investigated in the phenylbenzoquinone induced 'writhing' and 'hot plate' test in mice and at radioligand binding assay. At 'writhing' test all compounds, without exception, were more active than acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) with ED50 values ranging from 0.04 to 11 mg/kg (i.p.) (ED50 for ASA - 39.15 mg/kg). Analgesic effect at the 'hot plate' test was observed for three compounds 4c,e,f at the dose 3-5 times higher then that of morphine (ED50-3.39 mg/kg). At radioligand binding assay of 4c,e,f only compound 4f exhibited affinity for the mu-opioid receptors similar to that of Tramadol. The acute toxicity of the pyrrolopyridazinones 4, 5 were also studied and non toxic effect was observed at the 2000 mg/kg (5a 1420 mg/kg) i.p. dose level. On the basis of the available pharmacological data S-A relationship is discussed. The preferred conformational characteristic of 4, taken 4c as an example, was also described.

In this study, we have shown that NMDA-specific [(3) H]homoquinolinate binding to rat brain membranes comprised 44% of total binding with a B (max) value of 5.73 pmol/mg protein, which was inhibited by NMDA with K (i) =0.867 mum. However, NMDA-specific [(3) H]homoquinolinate binding was not observed for a number of human recombinant NMDA receptors investigated, suggesting that there are subtle differences between the binding sites of recombinant and native receptors. Electrophysiological experiments revealed that homoquinolinate activated human recombinant NR1a/NR2A, NR1a/NR2B and NR1a/NR2A/NR2B receptors with EC50 values of 25.2, 13.8 and 9.04 mum, respectively, with intrinsic activities of 148, 93.3 and 125%, respectively, compared to glutamate (=100%). In contrast to an autoradiographical study, these radioligand binding and electrophysiological experiments suggest that homoquinolinate is not highly selective for NR2B-containing receptors.

Our current structural understanding of DAT is derived from the resolutions of DAT from Drosophila melanogaster (dDAT). Despite extensive structural studies of purified dDAT in complex with a variety of antidepressants, psychostimulants and its endogenous substrate, dopamine, the molecular pharmacology of purified, full length dDAT is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we functionally characterized purified, full length dDAT in detergent micelles using radioligand binding with the scintillation proximity assay. We elucidate the consequences of Na+ and Cl- binding on [H-3]nisoxetine affinity and use this to evaluate the binding profiles of substrates and inhibitors to the transporter. Additionally, the technique allowed us to directly determine a equilibrium binding affinity (K-d) for [H-3]dopamine to dDAT. To compare with a more native system, the affinities of specified monoamines and inhibitors was determined on dDAT, human DAT and human norepinephrine transporter expressed in COS-7 cells. With our gathered data, we established a pharmacological profile for purified, full length dDAT that will be useful for subsequent biophysical studies using dDAT as model protein for the mammalian NSS family of proteins.

Considering the pharmacophore model of BZD binding to GABA-A receptor, novel diphenyl 1,3,4-oxadiazole compounds as BZD ligands were designed. The compounds were synthesized and structurally confirmed using LCMS, IR and NMR techniques. We investigated the affinity of the compounds to BZD receptors using radioligand [H-3]-flumazenil by in-vitro studies. In addition, sedative-hypnotic, anxiety, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, memory impairment, and motor coordination activities of the synthesized compounds were evaluated using in-vivo studies. Based on in-vitro studies, compounds 7i and 7j were the most potent with IC50 values of 1.54 and 1.66 nM respectively. In-vivo studies showed that compound 7i has the highest impact on increased sedation, muscle relaxation, and decreased anxiety and these observations were antagonized by flumazenil. Compounds 7e and 7i were the most potent anticonvulsant agents among synthesized compounds in both MES and PTZ induced seizure tests. All synthesized compounds significantly decreased latency to fall in the Rotarod test but none of them had a significant impact on the memory impairment test.

In order to fulfill the demand of pre-clinical studies, we have developed an automated synthesis unit to synthesize this radioligand. The 4-[F-18]-ADAM was synthesized using TracerLab FN and FE modules and a modified module control program (TracerLab-Fx). The synthesis sequences were similar to that of the manual synthesis, i.e. nucleophilic fluorination of N,N-dimethyl-2-(2,4-dinitroplienylthio)benzylamine (1) with K[F-18]/K-2.2.2 followed by reduction with NaBH4/Cu(OAc)(2) and purifications with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and solid phase extraction. The radiochemical yield of 3 was 1.5 +/- 0.3% (n = 13, EOS). The synthesis time was 120 min and the specific activity was 1.75 +/- 0.77 Ci/mu mol (n = 13, EOS). The 4-[F-18]-ADAM synthesized by this module was stable over 4 h at room temperature and is suitable for imaging SERT in humans. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Ga-68/Lu-177-PSMA-1 combination is a theranostic agent for the detection and treatment of tumors overexpressing the PSMA target. Specifically, Lu-177-PSMA-1 is used in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer that is ineffective or intolerant to the latest generation of chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy. This radiopharmaceutical is manufactured in a radiopharmaceutical synthesizing unit and must pass a quality control where the radiochemical purity (RCP) is assessed prior to release of the batch. RCP evaluation is performed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Since there is no monograph for Lu-177-PSMA-1 in the European Pharmacopoeia, we validate the analytical methods according to the EANM recommendations adapted from ICH Q2. Specificity, linearity, accuracy, precision, intermediate precision, limit of quantification (LOQ) and robustness were described for HPLC and TLC in this study. The results obtained demonstrated the robustness and reliability of the HPLC and TLC analytical methods for the evaluation of the RCP of Lu-177-PSMA-1.

In the present study, we found that curcumin caused a concentration-dependent increase of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle isolated from Wistar rats. This action was inhibited by pirenzepine at concentration enough to block muscarinic M-1 cholinoceptor (M-1-mAChR) In radioligand binding assay, the binding of [H-3]-pirenzepine was also displaced by curcumin in a concentration-dependent manner. In the presence of inhibitors for PLC-PI3K pathway, either U73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor) or LY294002 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor), curcumin-stimulated glucose uptake into skeletal muscle was markedly reduced. In Western blotting analysis, the membrane protein level of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) increased by curcumin was also reversed by blockade of M-1-mAChR or PLC-PI3K pathway in a same manner In conclusion, the obtained results Suggest that curcumin can activate M1-mAChR at concentrations lower than to scavenge free radicals for increase of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle through PLC-PI3-kinase pathway.

In this Study. three small-molecule pindolol ligand derivatives were synthesized and their binding properties were tested in a radioligand displacement assay. The ligand derivatives were further labeled with fluorescent europium(III) chelate for beta(2)-adrenergic receptor-ligand binding assay. The europium-labeled pindolol ligands having no spacer (CO) or a 12-carbon spacer (C12) arm bound to the human beta(2)-adrenergic receptors overexpressed in human embryonic kidney HEK293(i) cells. Europium ligand with a 6-carbon spacer arm (C6) showed no binding. Competitive binding assays were developed with the functional labeled ligands. The IC50 values for beta(2)-adrenergic antagonist propranolol were 60 and 37 nM, the Z' Values were 0.51 and 0.77, and the signal-to-background ratios were 5.5 and 16.0 for CO and C12, respectively.

Correct definition and interpretation of results are key challenges for both radiologists/specialists in nuclear medicine as well as for the treating clinician. Strong interdisciplinary communication is prerequisite to solve the upcoming complexity of retrieved information generated by hybrid imaging. Objectives Different indications for hybrid medical imaging and review of current theranostic principles from the perspective of clinicians/clinical oncologists. Materials and methods The GBA guidelines and recommendations retrieved from the corresponding German S3 guidelines for the use of PET imaging are summarized, followed by a review of innovative clinical trials that promote PET-based therapeutic strategies and radioligand therapies. Results Next generation PET/CT and PET/MRI imaging are being increasingly used for diagnostic purposes and follow-up staging in malignant tumors. Radioligand therapy may have the potential to be a further cornerstone in personalized antitumor therapy. Conclusions Careful implementation of hybrid medical imaging can clearly improve the quality of the diagnosis in cancer patients and even increase the quality of care for cancer patients. Close interdisciplinary collaboration is essential to optimize therapeutic strategies for each patient.

We therefore explored the relationship between decline in episodic memory and beta-amyloid using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]AZD2184, a radioligand with potential to detect low levels of amyloid deposits. Methods Healthy elderly subjects with declining (n = 10) or stable (n = 10) episodic memory over 15 years were recruited from the population-based Betula study and examined with PET. Brain radioactivity was measured after intravenous administration of [C-11]AZD2184. The binding potential BP (ND) was calculated using linear graphical analysis with the cerebellum as reference region. Results The binding of [C-11]AZD2184 in total grey matter was generally low in the declining group, whereas some binding could be observed in the stable group. Mean BP (ND) was significantly higher in the stable group compared to the declining group (p = 0.019).

Conclusions We conclude that cognitive decline in the general population does not seem to stand by itself as an early predictor for amyloid deposits.

New compounds were synthesized and tested for their affinity for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in radioligand binding assay using [H-3]-prazosin as a selective radioligand. Antiarrhythmic activities in adrenaline-and barium chloride-induced arrhythmia models, an influence of the phenylpiperazine derivatives on the ECG-components and blood pressure were tested in vivo in normotensive rats. The hERG K+-antagonistic properties of the most potent antiarrhythmic agents were investigated in silico by the use of program QikProp. The highest alpha(1)-adrenoceptor affinity (K-i = 4.7 nM) and the strongest antiarrhythmic activity in adrenaline induced arrhythmia (ED50 = 0.1 mg/kg) was found for 1-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl) butyl)-3-methyl-5,5-diphenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione hydrochloride (19a). The results indicated a significant correlation between alpha(1)-AR affinities (pK(i)) and antiarrhythmic activity (ED50) in adrenaline model (R-2 = 0.92, p < 0.005). Influence of the examined phenylpiperazine hydantoin derivatives on hERG K+ channel, predicted by means of in silico methods, suggested their hERG K+-blocking properties. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

[C-11]N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2b-carbomethoxy-3b-(4-methylphenyl)nortropane ([C-11]PE2I), a radioligand with high specificity for DAT, has been shown to exhibit favorable kinetics and to produce high contrast positron emission tomography (PET) images. To better characterize this ligand and to assess its measurement reliability, PET images of seven subjects were acquired in a test-retest paradigm. For optimal model performance, each subject was scanned for 120 mins, ensuring that high binding regions could reach equilibrium, a validated coregistration method was performed for accurate anatomic delineations and an exhaustive search for a reference region having one-tissue compartment kinetics was undertaken. Eleven modeling methods were tested and six metrics were used for method evaluation. A noniterative two-tissue compartment method with 100 mins of scanning time was found to be optimal for characterizing [C-11]PE2I.

Accordingly, we have synthesized a new 5-HT1A receptor ligand (HYNIC-MPP4) and labeled it with Tc-99m using N-(2-hydroxyethyl)ethylenediaminetriacetic acid (HEDTA) as coligand. Tc-99m-HEDTA/HYNIC-MPP4 was prepared under pH 6 at room temperature. Biodistribution of 99mTc-HEDTA/HYNIC-MPP4 in normal mice showed that this complex had moderate brain uptake (0.60% ID center dot g(-1) at 2 min p.i.) and good retention. The hippocampus had the highest radioactivity uptake at 2 min p.i. (1.84% IDa <dagger g(-1)). The ratio of Hipp/CB was 3.1 at 2 min p.i. and increased to 4.4 at 60 min p.i. After blocking with 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin, the uptake of hippocampus was decreased significantly from 1.84% ID center dot g(-1) to 0.53% ID center dot g(-1) at 2 min p.i., while the cerebellum had no significant decrease. This Tc-99m complex could be a potent agent for 5-HT1A receptor imaging.

Materials and methods Binding studies were conducted using [I-125]PYY as the radioligand. Organ-bath studies were performed on isolated tissue strips for direct (postjunctional) contractile effects and for (prejunctional) inhibition of field stimulation effects. Any possible degradation of PYY was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results In the radioligand binding studies no quantifiable specific [I-125]PYY binding was detected in human bladder or prostate, while specific high-affinity binding was readily seen in rat cerebral cortex. In organ-bath experiments, PYY (up to 1 mu mol/L) caused no contraction of human prostate or bladder, whereas noradrenaline and carbachol, respectively, were effective; the potency or efficacy of noradrenaline and carbachol were not altered by PYY. Field stimulation-induced contraction was not affected by PYY in either human bladder or prostate, but was readily inhibited in rat vas deferens. HPLC detected no relevant PYY degradation by human bladder or prostate homogenates. Conclusion Human bladder and prostate express only very few if any functional NPY receptors.

The First Recombinant Viper Three-Finger Toxins: Inhibition of Muscle and Neuronal Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors	DOKLADY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS			English	Article							NAJA-KAOUTHIA; WEAK TOXIN; LIGAND; VENOM	Genes encoding two three-finger toxins TFT-AF and TFT-VN, nucleotide sequences of which were earlier determined by cloning cDNA from venom glands of vipers Azemiops feae and Vipera nikolskii, respectively, were expressed for the first time in E. coli cells. The biological activity of these toxins was studied by electrophysiological techniques, calcium imaging, and radioligand analysis. It was shown for the first time that viper three-finger toxins are antagonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of neuronal and muscle type.	[Makarova, Ya. V.; Kryukova, E. V.; Shelukhina, I.

Methods: Fifty-six mCRPC patients underwent PSMA radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA. Ga-68-PSMA-(N,N'-bis-[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid) (Ga-68-PSMA) PET/CT was used for patient selection and follow-up after PSMA RLT. Hematologic status, renal function, and serum prostate-specific antigen levels were documented before and after therapy. Dosimetry was performed in 30 patients. Results: Lu-177-PSMA demonstrated high absorbed tumor doses (median, 3.3 mGy/MBq) compared with the levels in normal organs. Parotid glands received higher doses (1.3 mGy/MBq) than kidneys (0.8 mGy/MBq). All patients tolerated the therapy without any acute adverse effects. Except for mild reversible xerostomia in 2 patients, no long-term side effects were observed. There was a small but statistically significant reduction in erythrocyte and leukocyte counts; only the reduction in erythrocyte counts decreased slightly below the reference range. No thrombocytopenia occurred. The severity of pain was significantly reduced in 2 of 6 patients (33.3%). A decrease in prostate-specific antigen levels was noted in 45 of 56 patients (80.4%). Of 25 patients monitored for at least 6 mo after 2 or more PSMA RLT cycles, a molecular response evaluation (Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT) revealed partial remission in 14, stable disease in 2, and progressive disease in 9 patients. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed partial remission in 5, stable disease in 13, and progressive disease in 7 patients. The median progression-free survival was 13.7 mo, and the median overall survival was not reached during follow-up for 28 mo. Conclusion: PSMA RLT with Lu-177-PSMA is feasible, safe, and effective in end-stage progressive mCRPC with appropriate selection and follow-up of patients by Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT through application of the concept of theranostics.

In addition, both sst(1) and sst(2) receptors are negatively coupled to growth hormone (GH) secretion in GC cells. Here we report on studies concerning the expression, the pharmacology and the functional role of native SRIF receptors in GC cells with the use of five nonpeptidyl agonists, highly selective for each of the SRIF receptors. Radioligand binding studies show that sst(2) and sst(5) receptors are present at different relative densities, while the presence of sst(3) and sst(4) receptors appears to be negligible. The absence of sst(1) receptor binding was unexpected in view of sst(1) receptor functional effects on GH secretion. This suggests very efficient receptor-effector coupling of a low-density population of sst(1) receptors. Functionally, only sst(2) receptors are coupled to the inhibition of [Ca2+](i) and cAMP accumulation and the selective activation of sst(5) receptors facilitates the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity through G(i/o) proteins. This effect was not observed when sst(2) and sst(5) receptors were simultaneously activated, suggesting that there is a functional interaction between sst(2) and sst(5) receptors. In addition, sst(1), sst(2) and sst(5) receptor activation inhibits GH release, further indicating that SRIF can modulate GH secretion in GC cells through mechanisms both dependent and independent on [Ca2+](i) and cAMP-dependent pathways. The present data suggest SRIF-mediated functional effects in GC cells to be very diverse and provides compelling arguments to propose that multiple native SRIF receptors expressed in the same cells are not simply redundant, but contribute to marked signalling diversity.

We found that at the peak of lithium-pilocarpine seizures, the B (max) value (the density of specific binding sites) decreases for [H-3]-SR 95531, [H-3](-)baclofen, [(3)De](+)MK-801, and [H-3]LY 354740 by 30-50% from the control level. The pre-treatment with levetiracetam (600 mg/kg) 40 minutes before pilocarpine kept the number of GABA- and NMDA-type receptors at the control level without affecting the metabotropic receptors. The administration of GIZh-290 (5.0 mg/kg), in contrast, maintained the density of GABA(A) receptors at the control level, while the density of other types of receptors remained decreased at the peak of seizures. Thus, the anticonvulsant effect of levetiracetam and GIZh-290 has different mechanisms.	[Kovalev, I. G.; Vasil'eva, E. V.; Kondrakhin, E. A.; Voronina, T. A.; Kovalev, G.

Here, we described the radiosynthesis and evaluation of the 9-(+)-C-11-DTBZ analog, 10-(+)-C-11-DTBZ, as a vesicular monoamine transporter2 (VMAT2) imaging agent and compare it with 9-(+)-C-11-DTBZ. 10-(+)-C-11-DTBZ was obtained by C-11-MeI methylation with its 10 hydroxy precursor in the presence of 5 M NaOH. It had a slightly better average radiochemical yield of 35.3 +/- 3.6% (decay-corrected to end of synthesis (EOS)) than did 9-(+)-C-11-DTBZ (30.5 +/- 2.3%). MicroPET studies showed that 10-(+)-C-11-DTBZ had a striatum-to-cerebellum ratio of 3.74 +/- 0.21 at 40 min post-injection, while the ratio of 9-(+)-C-11-DTBZ was 2.50 +/- 0.33. This indicated that 10-(+)-C-11-DTBZ has a higher specific uptake in VMAT2-rich brain regions, and 10-(+)-C-11-DTBZ may be a potential VMAT2 radioligand. Our experiment is the first study of 10-(+)-C-11-DTBZ to include dynamic brain distribution in rat brains.

Sera and purified IgG from 21 paranoid schizophrenic and 25 age-matched normal subjects were studied by indirect immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, dot blot, ELISA, and radioligand competition assays. Rat cerebral frontal cortex membranes and/or a synthetic peptide, with an amino acid sequence identical with that of human M-1 mAChR, were used as Ags. By indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry procedures, we proved that serum-purified IgG fraction from schizophrenic patients reacted to neural cell surfaces from rat cerebral frontal cortex. The same Abs were able to inhibit the binding of the specific M-1 mAChR radioligand [H-3]pirenzepine. Immunoblotting experiments showed that IgG from schizophrenic patients revealed a band with a molecular mass coincident to that labeled by an anti-M-1 mAChR Ab. Using synthetic peptide for dot blot and ELISA, we demonstrated that these Abs reacted against the second extracellular loop of human cerebral M-1 mAChR. Also, the corresponding affinity-purified antipeptide Ab displayed an agonistic-like activity associated to specific receptor activation, increasing cyclic GMP production and inositol phosphate accumulation, and protein kinase C translocation. This paper gave support to the participation of an autoimmune process in schizophrenia.

Time-resolved fluorescence ligand binding for G protein-coupled receptors	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; A1 ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; PARATHYROID-HORMONE RECEPTOR; CORRELATION SPECTROSCOPY; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; PEPTIDE RECEPTOR; SMALL MOLECULES; FLOW-CYTOMETRY; DRUG TARGETS	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their ligands are traditionally characterized by radioligand-binding experiments. These experiments yield excellent quantitative data, but have low temporal and spatial resolution. In addition, the use of radioligands presents safety concerns. Here we provide a general procedure for an alternative approach with high temporal and spatial resolution, based on Tb+-labeled fluorescent receptor ligands and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET). This protocol and its design are detailed here for the parathyroid hormone receptor, a class B GPCR, and its fluorescently labeled 34-amino acid peptide ligand, but it can be easily modified for other receptors and their appropriately labeled ligands. We discuss three protocol options that use Tb+-labeled fluorescent ligands: a time-resolved fluorescence separation option that works on native receptors but requires separation of bound and unbound ligand; a TRR-FRET option using SNAP-tag-labeled receptors for high-throughput screening; and a TR-FRET option that uses fluorescently labeled antibodies directed against an epitope engineered into the Flag-labeled receptors' N terminus. These protocol options can be used as standard procedures with very high signal-to-background ratios in order to characterize ligands and their receptors in living cells and in cell membranes via straightforward plate-reader measurements.

It is an ATP-binding cassette protein comprising 17 transmembrane helices. SUR is endowed with binding sites for channel blockers like the antidiabetic sulfonylurea glibenclamide and for the chemically very heterogeneous channel openers. SUR1, the typical pancreatic SUR isoform, shows much higher affinity for glibenclamide but considerably lower affinity for most openers than SUR2. In radioligand binding assays, we investigated the role of two amino acids, T1285 and M1289, located in transmembrane helix (TM)-17, in opener binding to SUR1 These amino acids were exchanged for the corresponding amino acids of SUR2. In competition experiments using [3H]glibenclamide as radioligand, SUR1(T1285L, M1289T) showed much higher affinity toward the cyanoguanidine openers pinacidil and P1075 than SUR1 wild type. The affinity for the thioformamide aprikalim was also markedly increased. In contrast, the affinity for the benzopyrans rilmakalim and levcromakalim was unaffected; however, the amount of displaced [H-3] glibenclamide binding was nearly doubled. The binding properties of the opener diazoxide and the blocker glibenclamide were unchanged. In conclusion, mutation of two amino acids in TM17 of SUR1, especially of M1289, leads to class-specific effects on opener binding by increasing opener affinity or by changing allosteric coupling between opener and glibenclamide binding.

Cells expressing CRFR1 were treated with tunicamycin to block receptor glycosylation. The nonglycosylated receptor did not bind the radioligand and had a decreased cAMP stimulation potency in response to CRF. To determine which of the polysaccharide chain(s) is/are involved in ligand interaction, the polysaccharide chains were deleted using site-directed mutagenesis of the glycosylation consensus, N-X-S/T. Two sets of mutations were performed for each glycosylation site: N to Q and S/T to A, respectively. The single mutants Q38, Q45, Q78, Q90, Q98, A40, A47, A80, A92, and A100 and the double mutants A40/A47 and A80/A100 were well expressed, bound CRF, sauvagine (SVG), and urotensin-I (UTS-I) with a normal affinity, and increased cAMP accumulation with a high efficiency. In contrast, the combined mutations A80/A92/A100, A40/A80/A92/A100, and A40/A47/A80/A92/A100 had low levels of expression, did not bind the radioligand, and had a decreased cAMP stimulation. These data indicate the requirement for three or more polysaccharide chains for normal CRFR1 function.

In equilibrium binding assays, the Org compounds significantly increased the binding of the CB1 receptor agonist [H-3]CP 55,940 [(1R,3R,4R)3-[2-hydroxy-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-4-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexan-1-ol], indicative of a positively cooperative allosteric effect. The same compounds caused a significant, but incomplete, decrease in the specific binding of the CB1 receptor inverse agonist [H-3]SR 141716A [N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboximide hydrochloride], indicative of a limited negative binding cooperativity. Analysis of the data according to an allosteric ternary complex model revealed that the estimated affinity of each Org compound was not significantly different when the radioligand was [H-3]CP 55,940 or [H-3]SR 141716A. However, the estimated cooperatively factor for the interaction between modulator and radioligand was greater than 1 when determined against [H-3]CP 55,940 and less than 1 when determined against [H-3]SR 141716A. [H-3]CP 55,940 dissociation kinetic studies also validated the allosteric nature of the Org compounds, because they all significantly decreased radioligand dissociation. These data suggest that the Org compounds bind allosterically to the CB1 receptor and elicit a conformational change that increases agonist affinity for the orthosteric binding site. In contrast to the binding assays, however, the Org compounds behaved as insurmountable antagonists of receptor function; in the reporter gene assay, the guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)triphosphate binding assay and the mouse vas deferens assay they elicited a significant reduction in the E-max value for CB1 receptor agonists. The data presented clearly demonstrate, for the first time, that the cannabinoid CB1 receptor contains an allosteric binding site that can be recognized by synthetic small molecule ligands.

J	Johansson, PA; Andersson, M; Andersson, KE; Cenci, MA				Johansson, PA; Andersson, M; Andersson, KE; Cenci, MA			Alterations in cortical and basal ganglia levels of opioid receptor binding in a rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; movement disorders; neuropeptides; dynorphin; enkephalin; striatopallidal; striatonigral; neocortex; in situ hybridization	MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIAS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE PATIENTS; GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; OPIATE RECEPTORS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; MU-OPIATE; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; PROJECTION NEURONS	Opioid receptor-binding autoradiography was used as a way to map sites of altered opioid transmission in a rat model of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Rats with unilateral B-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nigrostriatal pathways sustained a 3-week treatment with L-DOPA (6 mg/kg/day, combined with 12 mg/kg/day benserazide), causing about half of them to develop dyskinetic-like movements on the side of the body contralateral to the lesion. Autoradiographic analysis of mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid binding sites was carried out in the caudate-putamen (CPu), the globus pallidus (GP), the substantia nigra (SN), the primary motor area, and the premotor-cingulate cortex. The dopamine-denervating lesion alone caused an ipsitateral reduction in opioid radioligand binding in the Cpu, GP, and SN, but not in the cerebral cortex. Chronic L-DOPA treatment affected opioid receptor binding in both the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex, producing changes that were both structure- and receptor-type specific, and closely related to the motor response elicited by the treatment. In the basal ganglia, the most clear-cut differences between dyskinetic and nondyskinetic rats pertained to kappa opioid sites. On the lesioned side, both striatal and nigral levels of kappa binding densities were significantly lower in the dyskinetic group, showing a negative correlation with the rats' dyskinesia scores on one hand and with the striatal expression of opioid precursor mRNAs on the other hand. In the cerebral cortex, levels of mu and delta binding site densities were bilaterally elevated in the dyskinetic group, whereas kappa radioligand binding was specifically increased in the nondyskinetic cases and showed a negative correlation with the rats' dyskinesia scores. These data demonstrate that bilateral changes in cortical opioid transmission are closely associated with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia in the rat. Moreover, the fact that dyskinetic and nondyskinetic animals often show opposite changes in opioid radioligand binding suggests that the motor response to L-DOPA is determined, at least in part, by compensatory adjustments of brain opioid receptors.

Positron emission tomography (PET) measures of GABA(A)R availability in schizophrenia, however, have not revealed consistent alterations in vivo. Animal studies using the GABA(A)R agonist [H-3]-muscimol provide evidence that antipsychotic drugs influence GABA(A)R availability, in a region-specific manner, suggesting a potential confounding effect of these drugs. No such data, however, are available for more recently developed subunit-selective GABA(A)R radioligands. To address this, we combined a rat model of clinically relevant antipsychotic drug exposure with quantitative receptor autoradiography. Haloperidol (0.5 and 2 mg/kg/day) or drug vehicle were administered continuously to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats via osmotic mini-pumps for 28 days. Quantitative receptor autoradiography was then performed postmortem using the GABA(A)R subunit-selective radioligand [H-3]-Ro15-4513 and the non-subunit selective radioligand [H-3]-flumazenil. Chronic haloperidol exposure increased [H-3]-Ro15-4513 binding in the CA1 sub-field of the rat dorsal hippocampus ( p < 0.01; q < 0.01; d =+ 1.3), which was not dose-dependent. [3H]-flumazenil binding also increased in most rat brain regions ( p < 0.05; main effect of treatment), irrespective of the haloperidol dose. These data confirm previous findings that chronic haloperidol exposure influences the specific binding of non-subtype selective GABA(A)R radioligands and is the first to demonstrate a potential effect of haloperidol on the binding of a alpha 1/5GABA(A)R-selective radioligand. Although caution should be exerted when extrapolating results from animals to patients, our data support a view that exposure to antipsychotics may be a confounding factor in PET studies of GABA(A)R in the context of schizophrenia.

Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cell type in the nervous system, respond to neurodegenerative disorders through astrogliosis, i.e., converting to a reactive inflammatory state. The aim of this study was to investigate how in vivo quantification of astrogliosis using positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand deuterium-l-[C-11]deprenyl ([C-11]DED), binding to enzyme monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) which is overexpressed in reactive astrocytes during AD, corresponds to expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin, i.e., two well-established markers of astrogliosis, during A beta pathology progression. APP(ArcSwe) mice (n = 37) and wild-type (WT) control mice (n = 23), 2-16-month old, were used to investigate biomarkers of astrogliosis. The radioligand, [C-11]DED, was used as an in vivo marker while GFAP, vimentin, and MAO-B were used to investigate astrogliosis and macrophage-associated lectin (Mac-2) to investigate microglia/macrophage activation by immunohistochemistry of the mouse brain. A beta and GFAP levels were also measured with ELISA in brain homogenates. The intrabrain levels of aggregated A beta and reactive astrocytes were found to be elevated in APP(ArcSwe) compared with WT mice. GFAP and vimentin expression increased with age, i.e., with A beta pathology, in the APP(ArcSwe) mice. This was not the case for in vivo marker [C-11]DED that showed elevated binding of the same magnitude in APP(ArcSwe) mice compared with WT mice at both 8 and 16 months. Further, immunohistochemistry indicated that there was limited co-expression of MAO-B and GFAP. MAO-B levels are increased early in A beta pathology progression, while GFAP and vimentin appear to increase later, most likely as a consequence of abundant A beta plaque formation. Thus, [C-11]DED is a useful PET radioligand for the detection of changes in MAO-B at an early stage of AD progression but does not measure the total extent of astrogliosis at advanced stages of A beta pathology.

However, data are not available regarding the feasibility of Lu-177-labled PSMA-targeted RLT in East Asians. The present study summarized the first experience with Lu-177-PSMA-I&T therapy for mCRPC in China. MethodsForty consecutive patients with mCRPC were enrolled from December 2019 to September 2021. Eligible patients received Lu-177-PSMA-I&T RLT at intervals of 8-12 weeks. Toxicity was assessed based on standardized physicians' reports and the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events criteria. Response to PRLT was evaluated according to the changes of prostate specific antigen (PSA) response and imaging response. Quality of life (QOL), Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and pain (visual analogue scale, VAS) were also evaluated. The impacts of baseline parameters on the therapeutic effects were explored by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. ResultsAll patients underwent a total of 86 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T (range: 1-5 cycles) with dosages of 3.70-14.43GBq per cycle, with a median of 8 months followed up. Six patients (15%) developed mild reversible xerostomia during follow-up, and 28 patients (70%) experienced grade 1-4 bone marrow dysfunction. Changes in PSA were assessed after therapy, accompanied by the partial response (PR) in 25 patients (62.5%), the stable disease (SD) in 5 patients (12.5%), and the progressive disease (PD) in 10 patients (25%), respectively. QOL, KPS (%) and VAS scores were improved significantly due to treatment (P<0.05). Overweight and elevated AST, ALP, and LDH were associated with poor outcomes. Conclusions(177)Lu-PSMA-I&T achieves the favourable response and well tolerance in mCRPC, which associates with not only PSA decline but also with tumor remission including lymphadenopathy and bone metastasis. We also find that patients with overweight and high AST, ALP, and LDH should be cautious to undergo the PRLT. Large-cohort studies are warranted to confirm the initial findings and elucidate the survival benefit of the treatment.

Integrin alpha v beta 6 is a cell surface receptor overexpressed in PDAC. Consequently, it may serve as a target for the development of probes for imaging diagnosis and radioligand therapy. Engineered cystine knottin peptides specific for integrin alpha v beta 6 have recently been developed showing high affinity and stability. This study aimed to evaluate an integrin alpha v beta 6-specific knottin molecular probe containing the therapeutic radionuclide Lu-177 for targeting of PDAC. Methods: The expression of integrin alpha v beta 6 in PDAC cell lines BxPC-3 and Capan-2 was analyzed using RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence. In vitro competition and saturation radioligand binding assays were performed to calculate the binding affinity of the DOTA-coupled tracer loaded with and without lutetium to BxPC-3 and Capan-2 cell lines as well as the maximum number of binding sites in these cell lines. To evaluate tracer accumulation in the tumor and organs, SPECT/CT, biodistribution and dosimetry projections were carried out using a Capan-2 xenograft tumor mouse model. Results: RT-qPCR and immunofluorescence results showed high expression of integrin alpha v beta 6 in BxPC-3 and Capan-2 cells. A competition binding assay revealed high affinity of the tracer with IC50 values of 1.69 nM and 9.46 nM for BxPC-3 and Capan-2, respectively. SPECT/CT and biodistribution analysis of the conjugate Lu-177-DOTA-integrin alpha v beta 6 knottin demonstrated accumulation in Capan-2 xenograft tumors (3.13 +/- 0.63%IA/g at day 1 post injection) with kidney uptake at 19.2 +/- 2.5 %IA/g, declining much more rapidly than in tumors. Conclusion: Lu-177-DOTA-integrin alpha v beta 6 knottin was found to be a high-affinity tracer for PDAC tumors with considerable tumor accumulation and moderate, rapidly declining kidney uptake. These promising results warrant a preclinical treatment study to establish therapeutic efficacy.

Previous molecular dynamics studies from our laboratory indicated that the amino acids Asp106 in the third transmembrane domain (TMD), Gln167 in TMD IV of alpha(1a)-AR were directly involved in prazosin, tamsulosin and KMD-3213 binding. The Asp106Ala mutant did not exhibit any affinity for [H-3]prazosin. On the other hand, the Gln167Phe mutant alpha(1a)-AR showed reduced binding affinity for [H-3]prazosin. In competition binding experiment the binding affinities of prazosin and tamsulosin were increased 11-fold and 33-fold respectively to Gln167Phe mutant in comparison with wild type receptor. It seems that mutation of this residue by phenylalanine has offered more interaction for the ligands with its aromatic ring. The results provide direct evidence that these amino acid residues are responsible for the interactions between alpha(1a)-AR and radioligand [H-3]prazosin as well as tamsulosin and KMD-3213.

Methods: Whole-body PET was performed on 7 subjects after injection of 710 +/- 85 MBq of (CNNC)-C-11 112. Fourteen frames were acquired for a total of 120 min in 7 segments of the body. Regions of interest were drawn on compressed planar images of source organs that could be identified. Radiation dose estimates were calculated from organ residence times using the OLINDA 1.0 program. Results: The organs with the highest radiation-absorbed doses were the gallbladder, liver, lungs, kidneys, and urinary bladder wall. Biexponential fitting of mean bladder activity demonstrated that 15% of activity was excreted via the urine. With a 2.4-h voiding interval, the effective dose was 5.7 mu Sv/MBq (21.1 mrem/mCi). Conclusion: C-11-NNC 112 displays a favorable radiation dose profile in humans and would allow multiple PET examinations per year to be performed on the same subject.

Radiochemical purities were >99% and specific radioactivity at time of injection was about 74 GBq/mumol. Autoradiographic examination of (SS)-[C-11]MeNER binding to human brain slices post mortem indicated specific binding in a brain region including the locus coeruleus. PET examination of both [C-11]MeNER enantiomers in a cynomolgus monkey demonstrated a higher specific binding of the (SS)-enantiomer with ratios of 1.4-1.6 in the lower brainstem, mesencephalon and thalamus to striatum. Pretreatment with the NET ligand, desipramine, decreased the specific binding of (S,S)-[C-11]MeNER. Labeled metabolites of [C-11]MeNER were all more polar. (SS)-[C-11]MeNER is a good lead compound in the search for a selective radioligand for quantitation of NET in the human brain in vivo. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In vitro, compound 3 displayed high affinity for sigma(1) receptors (K-i = 1.2 nM) as well as high selectivity. [F-18]3 radiosynthesis was performed from the corresponding tosylate precursor, with high radiochemical yield (45-51 %), purity (> 98%), and specific activity (> 201 GBq mu mol(-1)). Metabolic stability of [F-18]3 in the brain of CD-1 mice was verified, and no penetration of peripheral radiometabolites into the cerebral tissue was observed. Results of ex vivo autoradiography revealed that the distribution of [F-18]3 in the brain corresponded to regions with high sigma(1) receptor density. The highest region-specific total-to-nonspecific ratio was determined in the facial nucleus (4.00). Biodistribution studies indicated rapid and high levels in brain uptake of [F-18]3 (2.2% ID per gram at 5 min p.i.). Pre-administration of haloperidol significantly inhibited [F-18]3 uptake into the brain and s1 receptor-expressing organs, further confirming in vivo target specificity.

Since this kind of therapy has gained a large momentum in recent years, an upscaled production process yielding multiple patient doses in one batch has been developed. During upscaling, the established production method as well as the HPLC quality control were challenged. A major finding was a correlation between the specific activity and the formation of a pre-peak, presumably caused by radiolysis. Hence, nonradioactive reference standards were irradiated with an X-ray source and the formed pre-peak was subsequently identified as a deiodination product by UPLC-MS. To confirm the occurrence of the same deiodinated side product in the routine batch, a customized deiodinated precursor was radiolabeled and analyzed with the same HPLC setup, revealing an identical retention time to the pre-peak in the formerly synthesized routine batches. Additionally, further cyclization products of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA(I&T) were identified as major contributors to radiochemical impurities. The comparison of two HPLC methods showed the likelihood of the overestimation of the radiochemical purity during the synthesis of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA(I&T). Finally, a prospective cost reduction through an optimization of the production process was shown.

To investigate GR binding characteristics in intact porcine immune cells, blood samples of 6 castrated male pigs were collected via indwelling vein catheters. Porcine PBMC and granulocytes were isolated using two-layer density gradients, followed by radioligand binding assays to determine the number of GR sites per cell and the dissociation constant IQ as a measure for GR binding affinity. The present study revealed a greater number of GR sites per cell (P = 0.039) in PBMC (mean SEM: 1,953 +/- 207 sites/cell) compared to granulocytes (1,561 +/- 159 sites/cell) in domestic pigs. Furthermore, porcine PBMC had a higher GR binding affinity than porcine granulocytes (P = 0.003) as the dissociation constant Kd of PBMC (1.8 +/- 0.2 nM) was lower than that of granulocytes (3.5 +/- 0.4 nM). Our results point to differences in underlying mechanisms of glucocorticoid signaling in different porcine leukocyte populations. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Engert, L.

Anti-thyroid autoantibodies, particularly against thyroperoxidase (also known as thyroid peroxidase or TPO), occur commonly in humans with autoimmume thyroid disease, and assays for anti-TPO autoantibodies are used in clinical diagnosis. In contrast anti-TPO autoantibodies have not been observed in classical mouse models of autoimmune thyroiditis, except in cases where mice were deliberately immunized with TPO. In the past, detection of anti-TPO autoantibodies in mice has relied on an indirect immunofluorescence assay (iIFA) which screens for thyroid follicle membrane staining in frozen sections of mouse thyroid glands. Since recent transgenic mouse models of autoimmune thyroiditis spontaneously develop anti-TPO autoantibodies, an assay other than serial dilution and iIFA would be useful to detect and quantify these autoantibodies. In this paper we describe such an assay, based on the capacity of autoimmune mouse sera to bind to the extracellular domain of mouse TPO which was produced in a radioactively labeled form using a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system. The same approach, using human TPO, could provide a highly sensitive method to detect anti-TPO autoantibodies in humans. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We are testing the hypothesis that androgens can act directly in female reptilian reproductive tissues, via the androgen receptor. In this study, we sought to determine if androgen receptors are present in the oviduct of the turtle, Trachemys scripta, using radioligand-binding assays and immunological assays. An androgen-bin ding site was detected in turtle oviductal cytosol and oviductal nuclear extract by radioligand binding assay, using 3 H-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) as the ligand. This site was saturable (B-max= 11 pmol/g tissue), had a high affinity (10(-10) M), and showed specificity typical of androgen receptors (DHT > testosterone, progesterone >> estradiol, cortisol). Western blotting using an anti-androgen receptor antibody revealed a band of immunoreactivity in oviductal cytosol at approximately 115 kDa, and a more prominent band at 50 kDa, possibly indicating a truncated form of the androgen receptor. Immunohistochemistry revealed crossreactivity of the androgen receptor antibody against oviductal glandular cells but not against oviductal luminal epithelial or muscularis cells. The presence of androgen receptor in the turtle oviduct suggests that androgens have a role in female reproduction and that their action can be mediated directly by androgen receptor.

Hematotoxicity and Nephrotoxicity in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radioligand Therapy with [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T	CANCERS			English	Article						PSMA; radioligand therapy; RLT; Lu-177; nephrotoxicity; hematotoxicity; CTCAE	MITOXANTRONE PLUS PREDNISONE; RENAL-FUNCTION; OPEN-LABEL; LU-177-PSMA-617; CABAZITAXEL; SAFETY	Simple Summary Radioligand therapy (RLT) with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed agents has shown remarkable results in patients with advanced prostate cancer. Our objective was to provide data on the side effect profile of PSMA-directed RLT using the therapeutic radiotracer [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T. We evaluated patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer treated with at least three cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T. A substantial fraction of the patients already had impaired renal function and/or reduced white blood cell counts at baseline, but the degree of nephrotoxicity or hematotoxicity under RLT was low. No severe toxicities occurred under RLT. (1) Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed radioligand therapy (RLT) has shown remarkable results in patients with advanced prostate cancer. We aimed to evaluate the toxicity profile of the PSMA ligand [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T. (2) Methods: 49 patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with at least three cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T were evaluated. Prior to and after RLT, we compared leukocytes, hemoglobin, platelet counts, and renal functional parameters (creatinine, eGFR, n = 49; [Tc-99m]-MAG3-derived tubular extraction rate (TER), n = 42). Adverse events were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 and KDIGO Society. To identify predictive factors, we used Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. (3) Results: A substantial fraction of the patients already showed impaired renal function and reduced leukocyte counts at baseline. Under RLT, 11/49 (22%) patients presented with nephrotoxicity CTCAE I or II according to creatinine, but 33/49 (67%) according to eGFR. Only 5/42 (13%) showed reduced TER, defined as <70% of the age-adjusted mean normal values. Of all renal functional parameters, absolute changes of only 2% were recorded. CTCAE-based re-categorization was infrequent, with creatinine worsening from I to II in 2/49 (4.1%; GFR, 1/49 (2%)). Similar results were recorded for KDIGO (G2 to G3a, 1/49 (2%); G3a to G3b, 2/49 (4.1%)). After three cycles, follow-up eGFR correlated negatively with age (r = -0.40, p = 0.005) and the eGFR change with Gleason score (r = -0.35, p < 0.05) at baseline. Leukocytopenia CTCAE II occurred only in 1/49 (2%) (CTCAE I, 20/49 (41%)) and CTCAE I thrombocytopenia in 7/49 (14%), with an absolute decrease of 15.2% and 16.6% for leukocyte and platelet counts. Anemia CTCAE II occurred in 10/49 (20%) (CTCAE I, 36/49 (73%)) with a decrease in hemoglobin of 4.7%.

TLP was defined as the summed products of volume and uptake (Sigma Volume x SUVmean) of all tumor lesions. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to determine the most appropriate triangle TLP thresholds for classification into partial remission (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) regarding overall survival (OS). Furthermore, we analyzed criteria that are also frequently used in established response frameworks, such as the occurrence of new metastases as independent criterion (I) or in combination with change in tumor burden (II), and the change in PSA serum value (III).Results For the triangle TLP thresholds -30%/+30% (and also for higher thresholds, -40%/+40% or -50%/+50%), significant differences between all three response categories became apparent (PR/PD: p = 0.001; PR/SD: p = 0.001; SD/PD: p = 0.018). Including the development of new metastases as independent criterion of PD, there was no significant difference in OS between SD and PD (p = 0.455), neither when applied in combination with TLP (p = 0.191). Similarly, significant differentiation between SD and PD was not achieved by PSA serum value (p = 0.973).Conclusion In the largest monocentric study to date, TLP is shown to be a qualified prognostic biomarker, applying triangle TLP thresholds of -30%/+30%. It significantly differentiated between PR, SD, and PD, whereas other response criteria did not differentiate SD vs. PD. Using TLP, the development of new metastases is not a required information for predicting OS.

Radioligands are available for measuring total beta-AR density non-invasively with clinical positron emission tomography (PET) but none are selective for beta(1)- or beta(2)-ARs. The aim was to evaluate ICI 89,406, a beta(1)-AR-selective antagonist amenable to labelling with positron emitters, for PET. Methods The S-enantiomer of an [O-methyl-C-11] derivative of ICI 89,406 ((S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe) was synthesised. Tissue radioactivity after i.v. injection of (S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe (< 2 nmol center dot kg(-1)) into adult Wistar rats was assessed by small animal PET and post mortem dissection. Metabolism was assessed by HPLC of extracts prepared from plasma and tissues and by measuring [C-11]CO2 in exhaled air. Results The heart was visualised by PET after injection of (S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe but neither unlabelled (S)-ICI-OMe nor propranolol (non-selective beta-AR antagonist) injected 15 min after (S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe affected myocardial radioactivity. Ex vivo dissection showed that injecting unlabelled (S)-ICI-OMe, propranolol or CGP 20712A (beta(1)-selective AR antagonist) at high dose (> 2 mu mol center dot kg(-1)) before (S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe had a small effect on myocardial radioactivity. HPLC demonstrated that radioactivity in myocardium was due to unmetabolised (S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe although C-11-labelled metabolites rapidly appeared in plasma and liver and [C-11]CO2 was detected in exhaled air. Coclusion Myocardial uptake of (S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe after i.v. injection was low, possibly due to rapid metabolism in other tissues. Injection of unlabelled ligand or beta-AR antagonists had little effect indicating that binding was mainly to non-specific myocardial sites, thus precluding the use of (S)-[C-11]ICI-OMe to assess beta(1)-ARs with PET.

This receptor subtype is discussed in relation to the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia but no selective positron emission tomography (PET) ligand is available to date to study the distribution in vivo. The arylpiperazine derivative N-[2-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-3-methoxybenzamide (PB-12) is a never, high affinity (K-i = 0.040 nM) and selective D4R ligand. We radiolabeled PB-12 with carbon-11 (t(1/2) 20.4 min) by O-methylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue N-[2-[4-(4-chloro phenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-3-hydroxybenzamide (LM-190) with [C-11]methyl triflate. Derivative LM-190 was prepared by condensing 3-hydroxybenzoic acid with the appropriate amine. For the radiolabeling, the incorporation yield was >90% and the total synthesis time including high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification was about 35 min, The specific radioactivity of [C-11]PB-12 at time of injection was 67-118 GBq . mu mol(-1). PET studies in a cynomolgus monkey showed a high uptake and widespread distribution of radioactivity in the brain, including the neocortex and thalamus. About 40% of total radioactivity in plasma represented unchanged radioligand at 60 min after injection as determined by HPLC. Pretreatment with the D4R ligand 3-{[4-(4-chlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]methyl}-1H-pyrollo[2,3-b]pyridine (L-745,870) prior to radioligand injection failed to demonstrate receptor specific binding in the monkey brain. Furthermore, the brain radioactivity distribution was left unaffected by pretreating with unlabeled PB-12. This failure to detect a D4R-specific signal may be related to a very low density of the D4R in primate brain, insufficient binding affinity of the radioligand, and a high background of nonspecific binding. It can be concluded from these findings that [C-11]PB-12 is not suitable to Visualize the D4R in the primate brain with PET. NUCL MED BIOL 27;8:707-714, 2000. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies using TSPO radioligands such as [C-11]PK11195 and [C-11]PBR28 have indicated the usefulness of these PET biomarkers in patients with neuroinflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). [F-18]FEDAA1106 is a recently developed PET radioligand for the in vivo quantification of TSPO. In the present study, we aimed at investigating the diagnostic usefulness of [F-18]FEDAA1106 in patients with MS. Methods: Nine patients (three on the interferon beta therapy and six without immunomodulatory therapy; seven females/two males; age 34.2 +/- 9.1 years old) with relapsing- remitting MS in acute relapse and with gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing lesion(s) in the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and five healthy controls (four females/ one male, age 38.0 +/- 9.7 years old) were investigated in this study. Genetic information about the TSPO binding could not be obtained because knowledge about the importance of genetic background for TSPO binding was not available at the time the study was performed. Dynamic PET measurements were performed using an ECAT EXACT HR system (CTI/Siemens, Knoxville, TN, USA) for a total of 150 min, with a 30-min break after the injection of 153.4 +/- 10.2 MBq of [F-18]FEDAA1106. Metabolite-corrected arterial plasma samples were used to calculate the input function. PET data were analyzed in the following ways: (1) region-of-interest analysis for cortical and subcortical regions was performed using a two-tissue compartment kinetic model in order to estimate binding potentials (BPND) and distribution volume (VT), (2) the feasibility of the estimation of BPND and VT was investigated for MS lesions, and (3) VT parametric images by a Logan plot and standard uptake value (SUV) images were visually compared with the corresponding MRI, focusing on MRI-identified MS lesions. Results: There were no significant differences in the BPND or VT values between patients with MS and healthy controls. Robust BPND and VT values could not be obtained for most MS lesions due to noisy time-activity curves. Visual inspection of VT and SUV images in all nine patients did not reveal high uptake of the radioligand inside and beyond MRI-identified active MS lesions with the exception of one Gd-enhanced MS lesion in the whole patient population. Conclusions: In our study, [F-18]FEDAA1106 as a PET radioligand could neither differentiate patients with MS from healthy controls nor detect active plaques in the brain of MS patients. Stratification with respect to genetics and binder status might help to uncover the differences between the groups, which could not be detected here.

ELOVL6 deficient mice are protected from high-fat diet induced insulin resistance, suggesting that ELOVL6 might be a promising target for the treatment of metabolic disorders. Despite the increasing interest in Elovl6 as a therapeutic target, the lack of chemical tools for this enzyme has limited further elucidation of the biochemical and pharmacological properties of ELOVL6. We have identified Compound-A, a potent inhibitor for ELOVL6, by screening our company library and subsequently optimizing hit compounds. Compound-A potently inhibited human and mouse ELOVL6 and displayed >100-fold greater selectivity for ELOVL6 over other ELOVL family members. Consistent with its potent and selective inhibitory activity toward ELOVL6, [H-3]Compound-A bound to ELOVL6 with high affinity while showing no specific binding to other ELOVL enzymes. The observation that [H-3]Compound-A bound to ELOVL6 in a palmitoyl-CoA-dependent manner in the absence of malonyl-CoA and NADPH suggests that Compound-A might recognize an enzyme-substrate complex, e.g. an acyl-enzyme intermediate. Collectively, these observations demonstrate that Compound-A and its tritiated form are useful tools for biochemical and pharmacological characterization of ELOVL6.

Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and integrin alpha v beta 3 are highly expressed in the cell surface of cancer-associated cells or cancer cells compared with normal cells. Therefore, a FAP/integrin alpha v beta 3 bispecific heterodimer was developed for positron emission tomography (PET) diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy. The heterodimer DOTA-FAPI-RGD was labeled with the diagnostic radionuclide gallium-68 or the therapeutic radionuclide lutetium-177, with yields >80%, and high stability. The competitive displacement binding assay showed an IC50 = 6.8 +/- 0.6 nM for DOTA-FAPI-RGD towards FAP and IC50 = 2.1 +/- 0.4 nM to-wards integrin alpha v beta 3. Radionuclide labeled DOTA-FAPI-RGD showed high specificity and rapid internalization into U87MG cells (FAP/alpha v beta 3-positive) in vitro. Micro-PET and biodistribution studies of [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FAPI-RGD in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that a high and specific tumor uptake of the tracer and a fast body clearance, resulting in high contrast images. In addition to the imaging applications demonstrated in this study, the labeling of the heterodimeric ligand with the radionuclide lutetium-177 used in cancer treatment might allow the therapeutic application of this ligand.

However, the shortage of specific imaging tracer limits the effectiveness of PET. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) as an M2-type macrophage biomarker is receiving much attention considering its high abundance and specificity, which could be an ideal target for PET imaging. First, the expression of TREM2 in tumors and corresponding normal tissues was analyzed using a database and was verified by tissue microarrays and murine model slices, and we found that the expression of TREM2 in tumor tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues and enteritis tissues. Then, we established a macrophage co-culture system to obtain tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Compared with M1-type macrophages and tumor cells, TAMs had a higher expression level of TREM2. The novel radioligand Ga-68-NOTA-COG1410 was successfully synthesized for TREM2 targeting PET imaging. The biodistribution and micro-PET/CT results showed high uptake of Ga-68-NOTA-COG1410 in the tumor but not in areas of inflammation. The data testified that Ga-68-NOTA-COG1410 was a specific radioligand targeting TREM2, which could be used to distinguish tumors from inflammation. Using Ga-68-NOTA-COG1410, the effectiveness of PET on digestive tumors imaging may be enhanced.

The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze response in patients receiving 3 cycles of Lu-PSMA. Methods Seventy-one patients (median age: 72 years; range 44-87) received 3 cycles of RLT with Lu-PSMA (mean administered activity: 6.016 +/- 0.543 GBq) every 8 weeks. Response was evaluated using serum PSA levels and a PSA decline >= 50% was considered as biochemical response. Additionally, any PSA decline after the first cycle was evaluated for further therapy effects after the second and third cycle. Results A total of 213 cycles were performed in 71 patients. Data for response and adverse events were available for all patients. A PSA decline >= 50% and some PSA decline occurred in 56% and 66% of the patients. Of 30 patients with a PSA response after the first cycle, 28 remained responders and 12/41 of non-responders responded to further therapy cycles. Conclusion RLT with Lu-177-PSMA-617 shows respectable response rates. In this retrospective analysis, a relevant number of patients showed a delayed response, even if they did not respond to the first cycle of the therapy.

Evaluation of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Labeled Benzodioxine Piperazine-Based Dopamine D<sub>4</sub> Receptor Ligands: Lipophilicity as a Determinate of Nonspecific Binding	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VITRO EVALUATION; PENILE ERECTION; BRAIN; SELECTIVITY; ANTAGONISTS; AFFINITY; AGONIST; CLONING; GENE; RAT	Derivatization of the putative neuroleptic 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-4-(4-fluorobenzyl)-piperazine (3a) led to a series of new dopamine receptor D-4 ligands displaying high affinity (K-i = 1.1-15 nM) and D-2/D-4 subtype selectivities of about 800-6700. These ligands were labeled with the short-lived positron emitter fluorine-18 and analyzed for their potential application for imaging studies by positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro autoradiography was used to determine their nonspecific binding behavior as a result of their structural and thus physicochemical properties. The biodistribution, in vivo stability, and brain uptake of the most promising D-4 radioligand candidate were determined. This proved to be 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-4-((6-fluoropyridin-3-yl)methyl)piperazine ([F-18]3d), which revealed an excellent binding pattern with a high selectivity and limited nonspecific binding in vitro. This analogue also exhibited a high stability and an extremely high brain uptake in vivo with specific binding in hippocampus, cortex, colliculus, and cerebellum as determined by ex vivo autoradiography. Thus, [F-18]3d appears as a suitable D-4 radioligand for in vivo imaging, encouraging continued evaluation by PET studies.

In the present study, p-PVP-MEMA and its nor-derivative ({(R)-2-[6-chloro-5-((E)-2-pyridin-4- ylvinyl) pyridin-3-yloxy]-1-methylethyl} methylamine) as precursor for labelling with the short-lived positron-emitter carbon-11 (T-1/2 20.4 min) were synthesized in 10 chemical steps from 2-hydroxy-5-nitropyridine and Boc-D-alanine.

In this study, based on our previous results, novel annelated pyrimido- and diazepino[2,1-f]purinedione derivatives were designed as dual-target-directed ligands combining A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR) antagonistic activity with blocking monoamine oxidase B. A library of 19 novel compounds was synthesized and biologically evaluated in radioligand binding studies at AR subtypes and for their ability to inhibit MAO-B. This allowed 9-(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)-3-ethyl-1-methyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrimido[2,1-f]purine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (13 e; K-i human A(2A)AR: 264 nM and IC50 human MAO-B: 243 nM) to be identified as the most potent dual-acting ligand from this series. ADMET parameters were estimated in vitro, and analysis of the structure-activity relationships was complemented by molecular-docking studies based on previously published X-ray structures of the protein targets.

The cell-membrane stationary phase (CMSP) was prepared by immobilizing rat aorta cell membranes on porous silica, and the resulting CMSP was used to determine drug binding affinity to alpha(1D)-AR by frontal analysis. The CMSP of rat aorta was stable and reproducible. Relative binding affinities (dissociation constant, K-d) were determined by frontal chromatography for prazosin (166.13 +/- 18.36 nmol), BMY7378 (537.40 +/- 30.84 nmol), phentolamine (646.92 +/- 23.17 nmol), 5-methylurapidil (725.66 +/- 25.48 nmol), oxymetazoline (910.56 +/- 40.62 nmol) and methoxamine (1299.27 +/- 51.73 nmol). These results were consistent with the affinity rank order and showed a good correlation with the affinity of the same compounds for the cloned alpha(1D)-AR subtype obtained from radioligand-binding assay. The study demonstrates that frontal analysis of CMC may be used for direct determination of drug-receptor binding interactions, and that CMC is an alternative reliable method to quantitatively study ligand-receptor interactions.

Methods: Dynamic PET studies over 60 min with [F-18]FEFE were performed in nine Hartley guinea pigs in which a baseline (group 1, n=3), a predose (group 2, n=3; 2 mg/kg fenoterol 5 min prior to injection of [F-18]FEFE) or a displacement study (group 3, n=3; 2 mg/kg fenoterol 5 min post injection of [F-18]FEFE) was conducted. Results: In all animal groups, the lungs could be visualised and semi-quantified separately by calculating uptake ratios to non-specific binding in the neck area. Premedication with non-radioactive fenoterol and displacement tests showed significant reduction of lung uptake, by 94% and 76%, respectively. Conclusion: These data demonstrate specific binding of the new radioligand to the pulmonary beta(2)-receptors in accordance with ex vivo measurements. Therefore, [F-18]FEFE seems to be suitable for the in vivo visualisation and quantification of the pulmonary beta(2)-receptor binding in this animal model.

Radiolabelled 4-aminopyridine (4AP) derivatives have been proposed for imaging demyelinating diseases. Here, we describe methods for producing C-11-trifluoromethylated derivatives of 4AP and present early imaging results with [C-11]3-trifluoromethyl-4AP in a rhesus macaque. This study shows the utility of [C-11]CuCF3 for labelling pyridines and provides initial evidence for the potential use of [C-11](3)-trifluoromethyl-4AP as a PET radioligand.

The use of classical BZDs, e.g., diazepam, has been limited due to adverse effects such as interaction with alcohol, ataxia, amnesia, psychological and physical dependence, and tolerance. In the quest for new benzodiazepine agonists with more selectivity and low adverse effects, novel derivatives of 4,6-diphenylpyrimidin-2-ol were designed, synthesized, and evaluated. In this series, compound 2, 4-(2-(benzyloxy)phenyl)-6-(4-fluorophenyl) pyrimidin-2-ol, was the most potent analogue in radioligand binding assay with an IC50 value of 19 nM compared to zolpidem (IC50 = 48 nM), a nonbenzodiazepine central BZD receptor (CBR) agonist. Some compounds with a variety of affinities in radioligand receptor binding assay were selected for in vivo evaluations. Compound 3 (IC50 = 25 nM), which possessed chlorine instead of fluorine in position 4 of the phenyl ring, exhibited an excellent ED50 value in most in vivo tests. Proper sedative-hypnotic effects, potent anticonvulsant activity, appropriate antianxiety effect, and no memory impairment probably served compound 3, a desirable candidate as a benzodiazepine agonist. The pharmacological effects of compound 3 were antagonized by flumazenil, a selective BZD receptor antagonist, confirming the BZD receptors? involvement in the biological effects of the novel ligand.

The purpose of this study was to examine whether binding of PPIX to TSPO can also be detected in vivo using positron emission tomography and [C-11]PBR28, a radioligand that binds with high affinity and selectivity to TSPO. Rats were injected with a high dose of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA, 200 mg/kg i.v), which is a precursor for PPIX. ALA-pretreatment significantly decreased the uptake of [C-11]PBR28 in TSPO-rich organs such as heart, kidneys, lungs, parotid glands and spleen by 57-80%. As a control experiment, injection of a receptor saturating does of PK 11195, which is selective for TSPO, produced a pattern of displacement similar to that after ALA but with greater magnitude (88-97%). This study provides the first evidence that PPIX binds in vivo to TSPO Although PPIX. at physiological concentrations would likely occupy an insignificant percentage of TSPOs, it does reach high-enough concentrations in porphyria to occupy and have pharmacological effects via this target.

Here we identify a distinct function of this covalent modification in controlling the later proteolytic processing of receptors. Mutation of all cytoplasmic lysine residues in the murine delta-opioid receptor blocked receptor ubiquitination without preventing ligand-induced endocytosis of receptors or their subsequent delivery to lysosomes, as verified by proteolysis of extramembrane epitope tags and down-regulation of radioligand binding to the transmembrane helices. Surprisingly, a functional screen revealed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase AIP4 specifically controls down-regulation of wild type receptors measured by radioligand binding without detectably affecting receptor delivery to lysosomes defined both immunochemically and biochemically. This specific AIP4-dependent regulation required direct ubiquitination of receptors and was also regulated by two deubiquitinating enzymes, AMSH and UBPY, which localized to late endosome/lysosome membranes containing internalized delta-opioid receptor. These results identify a distinct function of AIP4-dependent ubiquitination in controlling the later proteolytic processing of G protein-coupled receptors, without detectably affecting their endocytic sorting to lysosomes. We propose that ubiquitination or ubiquitination/deubiquitination cycling specifically regulates later proteolytic processing events required for destruction of the receptor's hydrophobic core.

We identified a folate receptor in human parotid and submandibular gland which immunoreacted with antibodies against human milk folate binding protein, as evidenced by ELISA and immunostaining of ductal epithelium and secretory glandular material. The receptor concentration was 0.4-1.4 nmol H-3-folate bound/g protein. Ligand binding was of a high-affinity (K = 10(10) M-1) type, exhibited positive cooperativity, a slow radioligand dissociation at pH 7.4, and inhibition by folate analogues. The concentration of immunoreactive folate binding protein in saliva as determined by ELISA with antibodies against human milk folate binding protein was several fold higher than that determined by radioligand binding (nil - 1 nM). This indicates that a major fraction of the immunoreactive material does not bind H-3-folate, and could represent a precursor form of the protein. In conclusion, the folate binding protein in human saliva seems to be a secretory product of the salivary glands. The protein is also epitope-related to folate binding proteins in other human mucosal secretions.

In order to test the hypothesis that the regional decrease of NET is a disease specific biomarker in AD and as such, it can be used in PET imaging studies for diagnostic considerations, regional differences in the density of NET in various anatomical structures were measured in whole hemisphere human brain slices obtained from AD patients and age-matched control subjects in a series of autoradiographic experiments using the novel selective PET radioligand for NET (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2. (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 appears to be a useful imaging biomarker for quantifying the density of NET in various brain structures, including the LC and the thalamus wherein the highest densities are found in physiological conditions. In AD significant decreases of NET densities can be demonstrated with the radioligand in both structures as compared to age-matched controls. The decreases in AD correlate with the progress of the disease as indicated by Braak grades. As the size of the LC is below the spatial resolution of the PET scanners, but the size of the thalamus can be detected with appropriate spatial accuracy in advanced scanners, the present findings confirm our earlier observations with PET that the in vivo imaging of NET with (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 in the thalamus is viable. Nevertheless, further studies are warranted to assess the usefulness of such an imaging approach for the early detection of changes in thalamic NET densities as a disease-specific biomarker and the possible use of (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 as a molecular imaging biomarker in AD.

We hypothesized that variations in synaptic dopamine are reflected by variations of DAT radioligand binding. The effect of haloperidol, which increases synaptic dopamine concentrations, was therefore assessed in the rat striatum using I-123-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane (I-123-FP-CIT) as a DAT radioligand. Methods: Striatal I-123-FP-CIT binding was measured in 24 rats under baseline conditions (no pretreatment) and at 1 h after injection of haloperidol or a vehicle (1 mg/kg) using a small-animal SPECT camera. Results: Baseline equilibrium ratios (V-3") were 1.32 +/- 0.24 (mean +/- SD). After the haloperidol injection, V-3" decreased to 0.99 +/- 0.38 (P2-tailed < 0.0001), corresponding to a mean reduction of DAT binding by 25%. Conclusion: Our results are indicative of competition between the DAT ligand I-123-FP-CIT and synaptic dopamine elevated by haloperidol, suggesting that the assessment of I-123-FP-CIT binding may be suitable to study variations in synaptic dopamine in vivo.

Ro-647312 has been radiolabelled with carbon-11 using [C-11]methyl triflate from the nor-methyl compound 2. The reaction was performed in acetone as solvent using aqueous NaOH as base. Following HPLC purification [C-11]Ro-647312 ([C-11]-1) was obtained in 6.9-9.2% (n = 3) radiochemical yield decay-corrected based on starting [C-11]CO2, with specific radioactivity measured at the end of the radiosynthesis ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 Ci/mumol (37-129 GBq/mumol). Radiochemical and chemical purities were assessed as >99 and >95%, respectively. Following i.v. injection of [C-11]-1 in rat, the distribution of radioactivity was homogeneous in all brain structures and did not correlate with the known distribution of NR2B subunits. The radioactivity observed in plasma was also higher than any brain structure throughout the time course of the experiment. [C-11]-1 does not possess the required properties for imaging NMDA receptors using positron emission tomography. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Indiplon is a novel pyrazolopyrimidine sedative-hypnotic agent, currently in development for insomnia. Using radioligand binding studies, indiplon inhibited the binding of [H-3]Ro 15-1788 (flumazenil) to rat cerebellar and cerebral cortex membranes with high affinity (K-i values of 0.55 and 0.45 nM, respectively). [H-3] Indiplon binding to rat cerebellar and cerebral cortex membranes was reversible and of high affinity, with K-D values of 1.01 and 0.45 nM, respectively, with a pharmacological specificity consistent with preferential labeling of GABA(A) receptors containing alpha1 subunits. In "GABA shift" experiments and in measurements of GABA-induced chloride conductance in rat cortical neurons in culture, indiplon behaved as an efficacious potentiator of GABA(A) receptor function. In both the radioligand binding and electrophysiological experiments, indiplon had a higher affinity than zolpidem or zaleplon. These in vitro properties are consistent with the in vivo properties of indiplon as an effective sedative-hypnotic acting through allosteric potentiation of the GABA(A) receptor.

HDAC6 has emerged as an interesting therapeutic target in the treatment of neuro-degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Techniques enabling noninvasive HDAC6 imaging in the brain could enhance understanding of its pathologic role, but development of brain-penetrating radioligands for HDACs imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) remains challenging. Here, we report the synthesis and evaluation of an F-18-labeled tetrahydroquinoline derivative, [F-18]2, based on the HDAC6 selective inhibitor SW-100 as a brain HDAC6 imaging radioligand. [F-18]2 was synthesized via copper-mediated radiofluorination from an arylboronic precursor, followed by removal of the catalyst by solid-phase extraction and then hydroxamic acid formation. [F-18]2 demonstrated good penetration and moderate stability in the mouse brain. In mouse plasma, however, [F-18]2 was rapidly metabolized to a corresponding carboxylic acid form. Blocking studies in mice with unlabeled compound 2 and HDAC6 selective inhibitors, including tubastatin A and ACY-775, demonstrated that the HDAC6 inhibitors displaced over 80% of [F-18]2 taken up in the brain, indicating selective binding of [F-18]2. These results suggest that [F-18]2 is a potentially useful PET radioligand for brain HDAC6 imaging.

This study aimed to perform positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of lung inflammation with [F-18]FEDAC, a specific TSPO radioligand, and to determine cellular sources enriching TSPO expression in the lung. Methods: An acute lung injury model was prepared by intratracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to rat. Uptake of radioactivity in the rat lungs was measured with small-animal PET after injection of [F-18] FEDAC. Presence of TSPO was examined in the lung tissue using Western blot and immunohistochemical assays. Results: The uptake of [F-18] FEDAC increased in the lung with the progress of inflammation by treatment with LPS. Pretreatment with a TSPO-selective ligand PK11195 showed a significant decrease in the lung uptake of [F-18] FEDAC due to competitive binding to TSPO. TSPO expression was elevated in the inflamed lung section and its level responded to the [F-18] FEDAC uptake and severity of inflammation. Increase of TSPO expression was mainly found in the neutrophils and macrophages of inflamed lungs. Conclusion: From this study we conclude that PET with [F-18] FEDAC may be a useful tool for imaging TSPO expression and evaluating progress of lung inflammation. Study on human lung using [F-18] FEDAC-PET is promising.

The A(2A) AR mRNA levels were substantially increased following 3-48 hr PC12 cell treatment with interleukin 1 beta (500 unit/mL) or tumor necrosis factor alpha (1000 unit/mL), as revealed by RT-PCR analysis. In parallel, cell cytokine treatment induced an up-regulation of A(2A) receptor protein. Equilibrium radioligand binding studies on treated-cells showed a significant increase in maximum density of [H-3] 2-(carboxyethylphenylethylamino) adenosine-5'-carboxamide binding sites, with no significant changes in the affinity constant value. The increase in A(2A) receptor density was also demonstrated by Western blot analysis. Interleukin 1 beta and tumor necrosis factor alpha effects on A(2A) AR mRNA and protein levels were detectable after 3 hr cytokine treatment and reached a maximum within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. These results demonstrated the existence of heterologous regulation of A(2A) ARs by proinflammatory cytokines. The biological significance of this regulation might be associated with modulating cellular activity in response to tissue damage associated with inflammatory mediator production.

D-1 receptor mRNA and specific [H-3]-SCH23390 binding sites were found in both striatal (nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus and putamen) and extrastriatal (globus pallidus and substantia nigra) brain regions. In parkinsonian brain, D-1 receptor mRNA was increased in the nucleus accumbens, while a decrease was detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta. No change in D-1 mRNA levels was found in the other brain areas examined. An increase in the density of specific [H-3]-SCH23390 binding sites was found in the anterior putamen and a decrease in the external segment of the globus pallidus, no changes were detected elsewhere. This study demonstrates that regulation of D-1 receptor expression in the brain of patients dying with Parkinson's disease that were treated with L-DOPA is confined to small alterations in restricted brain regions.

We have been alternatively exploring human GRP motifs of higher GRPR selectivity compared to frog BBN sequences aiming to improve pharmacokinetic profiles. In the present study, we compared two differently truncated human endogenous GRP motifs: GRP(14-27) and GRP(18-27). An acyclic tetraamine was coupled at the N-terminus to allow for stable binding of the SPECT radionuclide Tc-99m. Their biological profiles were compared in PC-3 cells and in mice without or with coinjection of phosphoramidon (PA) to induce transient neprilysin (NEP) inhibition in vivo. The two Tc-99m-N-4-GRP(14/18-27) radioligands displayed similar biological behavior in mice. Coinjection of PA exerted a profound effect on in vivo stability and translated into notably improved radiolabel localization in PC-3 experimental tumors. Hence, this study has shown that promising Tc-99m-radiotracers for SPECT imaging may indeed derive from human GRP sequences. Radiotracer bioavailability was found to be of major significance. It could be improved during in situ NEP inhibition resulting in drastically enhanced uptake in GRPR-expressing lesions.

Two series of azocarboxamides were synthesized as potential radioligands for dopamine D3 and the mu-opioid receptor, revealing compounds 3d and 3e with single-digit and sub-nanomolar affinity for the D3 receptor and compound 4c with only micromolar affinity for the mu-opioid receptor, but enhanced selectivity for the mu-subtype in comparison to the lead compound AH-7921. A "minimalist procedure" without the use of a cryptand and base for the preparation of 4[F-18] fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl ester [F-18]2a was established, together with the radiosynthesis of methyl-, methoxy-, and phenyl-substituted derivatives ([F-18]2b-f). With the substituted [F-18] fluorophenylazocarbylates in hand, two prototype azocarboxylates radioligands were synthesized by F-18-fluoroarylation, namely the methoxy azocarboxamide [F-18]3d as the D3 receptor radioligand and [F-18]4a as a prototype structure of the mu-opioid receptor radioligand. By introducing the new series of [F-18] fluorophenylazocarboxylic-tert-butyl esters, the method of F-18-fluoroarylation was significantly expanded, thereby demonstrating the versatility of F-18-labeled phenylazocarboxylates for the design of potential radiotracers for positron emission tomography.

Recent studies have shown that pinnatoxins E, F and G, found in New Zealand and Australian shellfish, act as antagonists at muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) at the neuromuscular junction. In the present study, binding affinities and modes of these pinnatoxin isomers at neuronal and muscle nAChRs were assessed using radioligand binding, electrophysiological and molecular modelling techniques. Radioligand-binding studies revealed that all three pinnatoxins bound with high affinity to muscle-type nAChRs, as well as to the 7 and 42 neuronal receptors, with an order of affinity of muscle type >7>42. The rank order of potency at all receptors was pinnatoxin F>G>E. Pinnatoxins F and G also antagonized ACh-evoked responses in 7 and 42 neuronal receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Molecular modelling revealed that pinnatoxins E, F and G make multiple hydrogen bond interactions with the binding site of muscle-type and 7 receptors, with few interactions at the 42 binding site, reflecting the binding affinity and functional data. This study shows for the first time that pinnatoxins E, F and G bind to, and functionally antagonize neuronal nAChRs, with interactions potentially playing a role in pinnatoxin toxicity.

In the present study, the effects of CBD on contractility and electrophysiological properties of rat ventricular myocytes were investigated. Video edge detection was used to measure myocyte shortening. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured in cells loaded with the Ca2+ sensitive fluorescent indicator fura-2 AM. Whole-cell patch clamp was used to measure action potential and Ca2+ currents. Radioligand binding was employed to study pharmacological characteristics of CBD binding. CBD (1 mu M) caused a significant decrease in the amplitudes of electrically evoked myocyte shortening and Ca2+ transients. However, the amplitudes of caffeine-evoked Ca2+ transients and the rate of recovery of electrically evoked Ca2+ transients following caffeine application were not altered. CBD (1 mu M) significantly decreased the duration of APs. Further studies on L-type Ca2+ channels indicated that CBD inhibits these channels with IC50 of 0.1 mu M in a voltage-independent manner. Radioligand studies indicated that the specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine, was not altered significantly by CBD. The results suggest that CBD depresses myocyte contractility by suppressing L-type Ca2+ channels at a site different than dihydropyridine binding site and inhibits excitation-contraction coupling in cardiomyocytes.

This observation prompted us to examine the action of bile acids on two human colon cancer cell lines: H508, which expresses M3 receptors, and SNU-C4, which does not. Cellular proliferation was determined using a colorimetric assay. Interaction with muscarinic receptors was determined by measuring inhibition of muscarinic radioligand binding and changes in cellular inositol phosphate (IP) formation. Lithocholyltaurine (LCT) caused a dose-dependent increase in H508 cell proliferation that was not observed in SNU-C4 cells. After a 6-day incubation with 300 muM LCT, H508 cell proliferation increased by 200% compared to control. Moreover, in H508 cells, LCT caused a dose-dependent inhibition of radioligand binding and an increase in IP formation. LCT did not alter the rate of apoptosis in H508 or SNU-C4 cells. These data indicate that, at concentrations achievable in the gut, LA derivatives interact with M3 muscarinic receptors on H508 human colon cancer cells, thereby causing an increase in IP formation and cell proliferation. This suggests a mechanism whereby alterations in intestinal bile acids may affect the growth of colon cancer cells. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

Physiological functions of insulin and IGF1 are relatively well-studied, but information about the role of IGF2 in the body is still sparse. Recent discoveries called attention to emerging functions of IGF2 in the brain, where it could be involved in processes of learning and memory consolidation. It was also proposed that these functions could be mediated by the receptor for IGF2 (IGF2R). Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanism of signal transduction through this receptor. Here we produced His-tagged domain 11 (D11), an IGF2-binding element of IGF2R; we immobilized it on the solid support through a well-defined sandwich, consisting of neutravidin, biotin and synthetic anti-His-tag antibodies. Next, we prepared specifically radiolabeled [I-125]-monoiodotyrosyl-Tyr2-IGF2 and optimized a sensitive and robust competitive radioligand binding assay for determination of the nanomolar binding affinities of hormones for D11 of IGF2. The assay will be helpful for the characterization of new IGF2 mutants to study the functions of IGF2R and the development of new compounds for the treatment of neurological disorders.

The synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) was previously identified as their main target. In the current study, we tested a collection of 500 approved drugs for interaction with the human SV2A protein expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Competition binding studies were performed using cell lysates with high SV2A expression and [H-3]brivaracetam as a radioligand. A hit rate of 3% was obtained, defined as compounds that inhibited radioligand binding by more than 90% at a screening concentration of 20M. Subsequent concentration-inhibition curves revealed the antihistaminic prodrug loratadine (K-i=1.16M) and the antimalarial drug quinine (K-i=2.03M) to be the most potent SV2A protein ligands of the investigated drug library. Both compounds were similarly potent as LEV (K-i=1.74M), providing structurally novel scaffolds for SV2A ligands. A pharmacophore model was established, which indicated steric and electronic conformities of brivaracetam with the new SV2A ligands, and preliminary structure-activity relationships were determined. The anti-convulsive effects of the natural product quinine may - at least in part - be explained by interaction with SV2A. Loratadine and quinine represent new lead structures for anti-epileptic drug development.

In order to avoid decarbonylation during the intramolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation of 11, the N-atom has to be protected with a trifluoromethylsulfonyl group. The second key step of the synthesis was the removal of the N-triflyl group, which was realized by K2CO3 induced elimination of trifluoromethanelsulfinate (F3CSO2-). In receptor binding studies with the radioligand [3H] ifenprodil the 3-benzazepin-1-ol 3c revealed a GluN2B affinity of 73 nM indicating that the phenolic OH moiety of 1 and 2 is not essential but favorable for high GluN2B affinity. In docking studies 3-benzazepin-1-ol 3c shows the same binding pose as ifenprodil-keto 1A in the X-ray crystal structure. H-bond interactions and lipophilic interactions of 3c and 1A are very similar. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thirteen synthesized compounds were evaluated by radioligand binding (A(1), A(2A), and A(3)) and adenylyl cyclase activity (A(2B)) assays in order to study their affinity for the four human AR (hAR) subtypes. Seven of the studied compounds proved to be selective A(3)AR ligands, with 3-(4'-methylphenyl)-8-(2-oxopropoxy) coumarin (12) being the most potent (K-i=634 nm). None of the compounds showed affinity for the A2B receptor, while four compounds were found to be nonselective AR ligands for the other three subtypes. Docking simulations were carried out to identify the hypothetical binding mode and to rationalize the interaction of these types of coumarin derivatives with the binding site of the three ARs to which binding was observed. The results allowed us to conclude that the 3-arylcoumarin scaffold composes a novel and promising class of A(3)AR ligands. ADME properties were also calculated, with the results suggesting that these compounds are promising leads for the identification of new drug candidates.

Parkinson's disease (PD), addiction, or schizophrenia. In this study we describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands as tools for visualization of dopamine D-2-like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR-MN212 (20) as a high-affinity ligand for D-2-like receptors (pK(i) (D2longR)=8.24, pK(i) (D3R)=8.58, pK(i) (D4R)=7.78) with decent selectivity towards D-1-like receptors. Compound 20 is a neutral antagonist in a G(o1) activation assay at the D2longR, D3R, and D4R, which is an important feature for studies using whole cells. The neutral antagonist 20, equipped with a 5-TAMRA dye, displayed rapid association to the D2longR in binding studies using confocal microscopy demonstrating its suitability for fluorescence microscopy. Furthermore, in molecular brightness studies, the ligand's binding affinity could be determined in a single-digit nanomolar range that was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. Therefore, the fluorescent compound can be used for quantitative characterization of native D-2-like receptors in a broad variety of experimental setups.

Matrix (2 g) was homogenized and centrifuged with the resultant pellet used as IHRs. These were characterized for total protein contents (6.1 mg mL(-1)) and compared with commercial receptors for aflatoxins (0.28 mg tablet(-1)) and chloramphenicol (0.12 mg tablet(-1)). Gel electrophoresis of the IHRs showed a mixture of polypeptides-an important attribute for multi-residues analysis-compared with commercial receptors that presented specific protein bands at 65 kDa (chloramphenicol) and 70 kDa (aflatoxins). The inhibition index of IHRs for aflatoxins B1 and B2 in wheat and bovine feed and chloramphenicol in bovine tissue at, above, and below maximum limits or minimum required performance limits, revealed an inverse relationship between radiotracer and analyte concentrations. Saturation with increased radioligand concentration up to 5.5 kBq indicated higher holding potential. However, increasing incubation time to 30 min did not significantly increase analyte-binding. The IHRs performance was comparable to commercial receptors with control point averages of 348, 410, 555, and 307 counts per minute determined for gentamicin, chloramphenicol, oxytetracycline, and aflatoxin M1, respectively in local milk samples.

Rapid preparation of (<SUP>11</SUP>C)flumazenil:: Captive solvent synthesis combined with purification by analytical sized columns	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						[N-methyl-C-11]flumazenil; PET; captive solvent	SEP-PAK; BENZODIAZEPINE	To produce the radioligand [N-methyl-C-11]flumazenil at very high specific radioactivity for our small animal imaging studies we have developed procedures for its rapid synthesis, purification and analysis. We have developed 'micro-reactor' apparatus which are assembled from analytical HPLC guard columns packed with stainless steel powder for performing the carbon-11 methylation reactions. These highly efficient reaction columns enable high radiochemical yields to be obtained with very small amounts of precursor (20-40 mu g). The very small amount of reactants used enables the use of small analytical-sized HPLC columns for the rapid purification of the radioligand. Combining these techniques has enabled us to consistently prepare [N-methyl-C-11]flumazenil from [C-11]iodomethane With radiochemical yields of 80% (decay corrected). This results in 8-10GBq of [N-methyl-C-11]flumazenil at very high specific radioactivities of 520-600 GBq/mu mol at the end-of-synthesis. The total preparation time from end-of-bombardment of cyclotron-produced [C-11]carbon dioxide to end-of-synthesis is 20 min. A quality control method based on very rapid HPLC analysis (completed within 2 min) on a micro-analytical HPLC column has also being developed to reduce the time from the end-of-synthesis to injection for imaging.

The islets of Langerhans, however, appear to have a reserve capacity of insulin secretion and, overall, assessments of insulin and blood glucose levels remain poor measures of BCM, beta-cell function and progression of diabetes. Thus, novel noninvasive determinations of BCM are needed to provide a quantitative endpoint for novel therapies of diabetes, islet regeneration and transplantation. Built on previous gene expression studies, we tested the hypothesis that the targeting of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), which is expressed by beta cells, with [C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine ([C-11]DTBZ), a radioligand specific for VMAT2, and the use of positron emission tomography (PET) can provide a measure of BCM. In this report, we demonstrate decreased radioligand uptake within the pancreas of Lewis rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes relative to their euglycemic historical controls. These studies suggest that quantitation of VMAT2 expression in cells with the use of [C-11]DTBZ and PET represents a method for noninvasive longitudinal estimates of changes in BCM that may be useful in the study and treatment of diabetes.

Many positive allosteric modulators of mGlu(4) have been developed. To better understand the role of mGlu(4) in healthy and disease conditions, we are interested in developing an mGlu(4) selective radioligand for in vivo studies. Thus, we had synthesized and studied [C-11]2 as a PET tracer for mGlu(4), which demonstrated some promising features as a PET radioligand as well as the limitation need to be improved. In order to develop an mGlu(4) ligand with enhanced affinity and improved metabolic stability, we have modified, synthesized and evaluated a series of new N-phenylpicolinamide derivatives. The SAR study has discovered a number of compounds with low nM affinity to mGlu(4). The dideuteriumfluoromethoxy modified compound 24 is identified as a very promising mGlu(4) ligand, which has demonstrated enhanced affinity, improved in vitro microsomal stability, good selectivity and good permeability.

We previously developed 5,7-dihydro-3-(2-(1-(2[F-18]fluorobenzyl)-4-piperidinyl) ethyl)-6H-pyrrolo(3,2,f)-1,2-benzisoxazol-6-one (2-[F-18]fluoro-CP-118,954) for in vivo studies of AChE in mice. In the present study, we automated the synthesis of 2-[F-18]fluoro-CP-118,954 for the routine use and evaluated the radioligand by microPET and ex vivo Cerenkov luminescence imaging of mouse AChE. 4-[F-18]Fluoro-donepezil, another AChE inhibitor, was used for comparison. Automated syntheses of 2-[F-18]fluoro-CP-118,954 and 4-[F-18]fluoro-donepezil resulted in high radiochemical yields (25-33% and 30-40%) and high specific activity (27.1-35.4 and 29.7-37.3 GBq/mu mol). Brain microPET images of two ICR mice injected with 2-[F-18]fluoro-CP-118,954 demonstrated high uptake in the striatum (ROI analysis: 5.1 %ID/g for the first 30 min and 4.1 %ID/g for another 30 min), and a blocking study with injection of CP-118,954 into one of the mice at 30 min after radioligand injection led to complete blocking of radioligand uptake in the striatum (ROI analysis: 1.9 %ID/g), whereas F-18-labeled donepezil did not show specific uptake in the striatum. In another set of experiments, the brain tissues (striatum, parietal cortex, frontal cortex and cerebellum) were excised after brain microPET/CT imaging of mouse injected with 2-[F-18]fluoro-CP-118,954, and a high striatal uptake was also detected in ex vivo optical and microPET images (ROI analysis: 1.4 %ID/g) and in gamma-counting data (2.1 %ID/g at 50 min post-injection) of the brain tissues. Taken together, these results demonstrated that 2-[F-18]fluoro-CP-118,954 specifically binds to AChE in mouse brains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We used subtype-specific oligonucleotide primers to localize the five genetically defined mAChR mRNAs (m1 through m5) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These experiments showed that all five mAChR subtype mRNAs are expressed in melanocytes. The PCR products were verified by restriction analysis and Southern blotting. Receptors were visualized in cultures of normal human melanocytes and specimens of normal human skin by subtype-specific rabbit anti-receptor polyclonal antibodies. Radioligand binding assays with the lipophilic drug [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate demonstrated approximately 9000 high affinity binding sites/cell. Micromolar concentrations of muscarine or carbachol transiently increased intracellular Ca2+, which could be attenuated by atropine, demonstrating coupling of the receptors to mobilization of intracellular free Ca2+. Lower concentrations of muscarine induced spontaneous repetitive spike-like increases of intracellular Ca2+ which is characteristic for the activation of muscarinic receptors. These results indicate that normal human skin melanocytes express the m1, m2, m3, m4, and m5 subtypes of classic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors on their cell membrane and that these receptors regulate the concentration of intracellular free Ca2+, which may play an important physiologic role in melanocyte behavior and skin pigmentation.

In vitro pharmacology of ambroxol: Potential serotonergic sites of action	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Ambroxol; Radioligand binding; Serotonin; Receptor; 5-HT3; 5-HT transporter; SERT	5-HT3 RECEPTORS; CELLS; TRANSPORTERS; ACTIVATION; INHIBITOR; EFFICACY; CHANNELS; BINDING; PROFILE; TABLET	Aims: Ambroxol is a muco-active agent with multiple, clinically relevant effects in the airway. Despite its widespread use and well documented clinical efficacy, there are few data on its mechanism of action and receptor pharmacology beyond sodium channel blockade and inhibition of guanylate cyclase. Accordingly, in vitro studies were conducted to determine its overall receptor pharmacology and possible sites of action. Materials and methods: In vitro radioligand binding/enzyme inhibition studies were conducted at 62 receptors, ion channels and enzymes using standard techniques. Additional in vitro studies were conducted to establish the potency of ambroxol at selected sites. Key findings: These studies indicate that ambroxol has affinity for the 5-HT3 serotonin receptor, as well as affinity for the 5-HT serotonin transporter (SERT), with IC50 values of 17,600 nM and 19,500 nM respectively. In vitro functional studies in isolated guinea pig colon indicate that ambroxol is a 5-HT3 serotonin receptor antagonist with an IC50 value of 36,000 nM. Significance: Together, these studies indicate that ambroxol may exert its beneficial properties via antagonism of the 5-HT3 serotonin receptor and/or inhibition of serotonin uptake (5-HT transport: SERT), in addition to its reported effects at the sodium channel and guanylate cyclase.

An industry-utilized "de-risking" approach was used to carry out initial pharmacological characterization and to assess potential next-generation candidates amenable to F-18 radiolabeling for preliminary evaluation. Procedures Radioligand binding methods were employed in mammalian brain homogenates to determine the SV2A affinity (K-d) and maximal binding capacity (B-max) of [H-3]UCB-J. Novel leads were then screened to identify compounds minimally with comparable binding affinities with UCB-J in order to select a F-18-labeled candidate for subsequentin vivoassessment in rat. In parallel, mammalian brain tissue section autoradiography was performed to assess specific SV2A distribution. Results [H-3]UCB-J bound with high affinity to a single population of sites in the rat brain (K-d = 2.6 +/- 0.25 nM;B-max = 810 +/- 25 fmol/mg protein) and control human cortex (K-d = 2.9 +/- 0.54 nM;B-max = 10,000 +/- 640 fmol/mg protein). Distribution of specific SV2A binding was shown to be homogeneous throughout the rodent brain and primarily in gray matter regions of rodent and human brain sections. Analog screening identified MNI-1038, MNI-1126/SDM-8, and SDM-2 as having comparable binding affinities with the currently available PET ligands. Subsequent [F-18]MNI-1126/[F-18]SDM-8 dynamic micro-PET imaging in rats revealedin vivouptake and accumulation in the brain with favorable kinetics. Chase studies using 30 mg/kg levetiracetam confirmed thatin vivobrain uptake of [F-18]MNI-1126/[F-18]SDM-8 was reversible. Conclusions Taken together, these data suggest [F-18]MNI-1126/[F-18]SDM-8 (since renamed as [F-18]SynVesT-1) characterizedviaanin vitroscreening cascade provided a measurablein vivoSV2A specific signal in the rodent brain. This tracer as well as the close analog [F-18]SDM-2 (since renamed as [F-18]SynVesT-2) is currently undergoing further evaluation in preclinical and clinical studies.

Opioids, cannabinoids and their receptors are well known for their overlapping pharmacological properties. We have previously reported a prominent decrease in mu-opioid receptor (MOR) activity when animals were acutely treated with the putative endocannabinoid noladin ether (NE). In this study, we clarified whether the decreased MOR activation caused by NE could be reversed by rimonabant in CB1 receptor deficient mice. In functional [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays, we have elucidated that 0.1 mg/kg of intraperitoneal (i.p.) rimonabant treatment prior to that of NE treatment caused further attenuation on the maximal stimulation of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-(NMe)Phe-Gly-ol (DAMGO), which is a highly specific MOR agonist. Similar inhibitory effects were observed when rimonabant was injected i.p. alone and when it was directly applied to forebrain membranes. These findings are cannabinoid receptor independent as rimonabant caused inhibition in both CB1 single knockout and CB1/CB2 double knockout mice. In radioligand competition binding assays we highlighted that rimonabant fails to displace effectively [H-3]DAMGO from MOR in low concentrations and is highly unspecific on the receptor at high concentrations in CB1 knockout forebrain and in their wild-type controls. Surprisingly, docking computational studies showed a favorable binding position of rimonabant to the inactive conformational state of MOR, indicating that rimonabant might behave as an antagonist at MOR. These findings were confirmed by radioligand competition binding assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with MOR, where a higher affinity binding site was measured in the displacement of the tritiated opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. However, based on our in vivo data we suggest that other, yet unidentified mechanisms are additionally involved in the observed effects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Patients received a [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan before the first and after the second cycle of PSMA-RLT. Total lesion PSMA (TLP) was determined by semiautomatic whole-body tumor segmentation. Molecular imaging response was assessed by change in TLP and modified PERCIST criteria. Biochemical response was assessed using standard serum PSA and PCWG3 criteria. Both response assessment methods and additional baseline parameters were analyzed regarding their association with OS by univariate and multivariable analysis. Results By molecular imaging, 40/66 (60.6%) patients showed partial remission (PR), 19/66 (28.7%) stable disease (SD), and 7/66 (10.6%) progressive disease (PD). Biochemical response assessment revealed PR in 34/66 (51.5%) patients, SD in 20/66 (30.3%), and PD in 12/66 (18.2%). Response assessments were concordant in 49/66 (74.3%) cases. On univariate analysis, both molecular and biochemical response (p = 0.001 and 0.008, respectively) as well as two baseline characteristics (ALP and ECOG) were each significantly associated with OS. The median OS of patients showing molecular PR was 24.6 versus 10.7 months in the remaining patients (with SD or PD). On multivariable analysis molecular imaging response remained an independent predictor of OS (p = 0.002), eliminating biochemical response as insignificant (p = 0.515). Conclusion The new whole-body molecular imaging-derived biomarker, early change of total lesion PSMA (TLP), independently predicts overall survival in [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT in mCRPC, outperforming conventional PSA-based response assessment. TLP might be considered a more distinguished and advanced biomarker for monitoring PSMA-RLT over commonly used serum PSA.

Human biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonist Cimbi-36 labeled with carbon-11 in two positions	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						C-11-Cimbi-36; 25B-NBOMe; 5-HT2A receptor; Biodistribution; Pharmacology; Pharmacokinetics; Positron emission tomography; Radiation dosimetry	BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE; SEROTONIN; PET; SAFETY; 1ST-IN-HUMAN; RADIOLIGAND; ACTIVATION; BINDING	BackgroundCimbi-36 can be C-11-labeled to form an agonist radioligand used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the 5-HT2A receptor in the brain. In its non-labeled form (25B-NBOMe), it is used as a recreational drug that can lead to severe adverse effects, in some cases, with fatal outcome. We investigated human biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of the radioligand with two different radiolabeling positions. Seven healthy volunteers underwent dynamic 120-min whole-body PET scans (injection of 581 16 MBq, n = 5 for C-11-Cimbi-36; 593 14 MBq, n = 2 for C-11-Cimbi-36_5). Time-integrated activity coefficients (TIACs) from time-activity curves (TACs) of selected organs were used as input into the OLINDA/EXM software to obtain dosimetry information for both C-11-labeling positions of Cimbi-36.Results The effective dose was only slightly higher for C-11-Cimbi-36 (5.5 mu Sv/MBq) than for C-11-Cimbi-36_5 (5.3 mu Sv/MBq). Standard uptake value (SUV) curves showed higher uptake of C-11-Cimbi-36 in the pancreas, small intestines, liver, kidney, gallbladder, and urinary bladder compared with C-11-Cimbi-36_5, reflecting differences in radiometabolism for the two radioligands. Variability in uptake in excretory organs for C-11-Cimbi-36 points to inter-individual differences with regard to metabolic rate and route. Surprisingly, moderate uptake was found in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in four subjects, possibly representing specific 5-HT2A/2C receptor binding.Conclusion The low effective dose of 5.5 mu Sv/MBq allows for the injection of up to 1.8 GBq for healthy volunteers per study (equivalent to 3 scans if injecting 600 MBq) and still stay below the international guidelines of 10 mSv, making C-11-Cimbi-36 eligible for studies involving a series of PET scans in a single subject. The biodistribution of Cimbi-36 (and its metabolites) may also help to shed light on the toxic effects of 25B-NBOMe when used in pharmacological doses in recreational settings.

In Vivo Characterization and Quantification of Neurofibrillary Tau PET Radioligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-MK-6240 in Humans from Alzheimer Disease Dementia to Young Controls	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						tau; positron emission tomography; Alzheimer's disease; quantification; MK-6240	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN; F-18-AV-1451; BIOMARKERS; PEOPLE; LIGAND; TRACER; RISK	Tau PET imaging has potential for elucidating changes in the deposition of neuropathological tau aggregates that are occurring during the progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). This work investigates in vivo kinetics, quantification strategies, and imaging characteristics of a novel tau PET radioligand F-18-MK-6240 in humans. Methods: Fifty-one individuals ranging from cognitively normal young controls to persons with dementia underwent T1-weighted MRI as well as C-11-PiB and F-18-MK-6240 PET imaging. PET data were coregistered to the MRI, and time-activity curves were extracted from regions of interest to assess F-18-MK-6240 kinetics. The pons and inferior cerebellum were investigated as potential reference regions. Reference tissue methods (Logan graphical analysis [LGA] and multilinear reference tissue method [MRTM2]) were investigated for quantification of F-18-MK-6240 distribution volume ratios (DVRs) in a subset of 19 participants. Stability of DVR methods was evaluated using truncated scan durations. SUV ratio (SUVR) estimates were compared with DVR estimates to determine the optimal timing window for SUVR analysis. Parametric SUVR images were used to identify regions of potential off-target binding and to compare binding patterns with neurofibrillary tau staging established in neuropathology literature. Results: SUVs in the pons and the inferior cerebellum indicated consistent clearance across all 51 subjects. LGA and MRTM2 DVR estimates were similar, with LGA slightly underestimating DVR compared with MRTM2. DVR estimates remained stable when truncating the scan duration to 60 min. SUVR determined 70-90 min after injection of F-18-MK-6240 indicated linearity near unity when compared with DVR estimates and minimized potential spill-in from uptake outside the brain. F-18-MK-6240 binding patterns in target regions were consistent with neuropathological neurofibrillary tau staging. Off-target binding regions included the ethmoid sinus, clivus, meninges, substantia nigra, but not the basal ganglia or choroid plexus. Conclusion: F-18-MK-6240 is a promising PET radioligand for in vivo imaging of neurofibrillary tau aggregates in AD with minimal off-target binding in the human brain.

The two-step synthesis includes preparation of [F-18]fluoropropyl tosylate and its use without purification in the fluoroalkylation of 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)nortropane (nor-beta-CFT). The final product is purified by HPLC. Optimization of the two synthesis steps resulted in a greater than 30% radiochemical yield of [F-18]beta-CFT-FP (decay corrected to end of bombardment). The synthesis time including HPLC-purification was approximately 90min. The radiochemical purity of the final product was higher than 99% and the specific radioactivity at the end of synthesis was typically 20 GBq/mu mol. In comparison to alkylation by [F-18]fluoropropyl bromide, the procedure described here results in an improved overall radiochemical yield of [F-18]beta-CFT-FP in a shorter time.

Tagged receptors demonstrated a wild-type pharmacology and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. After solubilization and immunoprecipitation, monomers, dimers, and trimers of each subtype were apparent on Western blots. Further denaturation with 6 M urea reduced most oligomers to monomers. Deglycosylation reduced the molecular size of alpha(1A)-, and to a lesser extent alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenergic receptors. Radioligand binding site density was highest for alpha(1A) and much lower for alpha(1B) - and alpha(1D)-adrenergic receptors, but did not correlate with protein expression. Commercial anti-alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor antibodies did not recognize the tagged receptors in Western blots of cell lysates, and substantial cross-reactivity was still observed after solubilization and immunoprecipitation. Surprisingly, only receptor monomers were apparent after photoaffinity labeling with I-125-arylazidoprazosin, and the intensity of photoaffinity-labeling correlated with the density of radioligand binding sites. We conclude that epitope-tagged alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors exist as both monomers and oligomers in HEK293 cells, but there is substantial discrepancy between protein and binding site expression. Because only monomers are detected by photoaffinity labeling, dimers and trimers observed on Western blots may be pharmacologically inactive.

In the second decade of the 21st century, a new era in nuclear medicine was initiated by the clinical introduction of small-molecule PSMA inhibitor radioligands, 40 y after the clinical introduction of F-18-FDG. Because of the high incidence and mortality of PC, the new PSMA radioligands have already had a remarkable impact on the clinical management of PC. For the continuing clinical development and long-term success of theranostic agents, designing modern prospective clinical trials in theranostic nuclear medicine is essential. First-in-human studies with PSMA radioligands derived from small-molecule PSMA inhibitors showed highly sensitive imaging of PSMA-positive PC by means of PET and SPECT as well as a dramatic response of metastatic castration-resistant PC after PSMA radioligand therapy. This tremendous success logically led to the initiation of prospective clinical trials with several PSMA radioligands. Meanwhile, MIP-1404, PSMA-11, 2-(3-{1-carboxy-5-[(6-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl}-ureido)pentanedioic acid (DCFPyL), PSMA-617, PSMA-1007, and others have entered or will enter prospective clinical trials soon in several countries. The significance becomes apparent by, for example, the considerable increase in the number of publications about PSMA-targeted PET imaging from 2013 to 2016 (e.g., a search of the Web of Science for "PSMA" AND "PET" found only 19 publications in 2013 but 218 in 2016). Closer examination of the initial success of PC treatment with PSMA inhibitor radiotracers leads to several questions from the basic research perspective as well as from the perspective of clinical demands: What lessons have been learned regarding the design of PSMA radioligands that have already been developed? Has an acceptable compromise between optimal PSMA radioligand design and a broad range of clinical demands been reached? Can the lessons learned from multiple successes within the PSMA experience be transferred to further theranostic approaches?

Specific binding at equilibrium represented >90% of total binding and was fully reversible by methiothepin (10 mu M), full dissociation occurring by 100 min. The association (k(+ 1)) and dissociation (k(-1)) rate constants were 0.05 nM(-1) min(-1) and 0.05 min(-1) respectively, giving a K-D (k(-1)/k(+1)) of 1.0 nM. 3 [H-3]-SB-269970 bound saturably and apparently monophasically to both h5-HT7(a)/293 and guinea-pig cortex membranes, with K-D values of 1.25+/-0.05 and 1.7+/-0.3 nM respectively. The B-max for [3H]-SB-269970 to both h5-HT7(a)/293 and guinea-pig cortex membranes (5780+/-380 and 125+/-8.2 fmoles mg protein(-1) respectively) was similar to that for [H-3]-5-CT (6190+/-940 and 143+19 fmoles mg protein(-1) respectively). These data suggest that, in each tissue, both radioligands labelled the same population of receptors, which appear to be present in an agonist high affinity state. 4 The profile of compound inhibition of [H-3]-SB-269970 binding to h5-HT7(a)/293 and guinea-pig cortex membranes correlated well (corr. coeff. 0.98) with those for [3H]-5-CT binding and were consistent with the profiles reported previously for the human 5-HT7(a) and guinea-pig cortex 5-HT7 receptors using [3H]-5-CT. Hill slopes for inhibition of [3H]-SB-269970 and [3H]-5-CT binding were close to.l, consistent with binding to a single receptor population in both tissues. 5 [H-3]-SB-269970 represents the first selective 5-HT7 antagonist radioligand, which should aid further characterization of 5-HT7 receptors in recombinant and native tissues and help establish their role in brain function.

Monitoring glial activation in subjects with MS, therefore, has the potential to be informative with respect to disease activity. The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is a promising biomarker of glial activation that can be imaged by positron emission tomography (PET). To characterize the in vivo TSPO expression in MS, we analyzed brain PET scans in subjects with MS and healthy volunteers in an observational study using [C-11]PBR28, a newly developed translocator protein-specific radioligand. The [C-11]PBR28 PET showed altered compartmental distribution of TSPO in the MS brain compared to healthy volunteers (p = 0.019). Focal increases in [C-11]PBR28 binding corresponded to areas of active inflammation as evidenced by significantly greater binding in regions of gadolinium contrast enhancement compared to contralateral normal-appearing white matter (p = 0.0039). Furthermore, increase in [C-11]PBR28 binding preceded the appearance of contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging in some lesions, suggesting a role for early glial activation in MS lesion formation. Global [C-11]PBR28 binding showed correlation with disease duration (p = 0.041), but not with measures of clinical disability. These results further define TSPO as an informative marker of glial activation in MS.

We sought to develop such a PET radioligand. High-affinity NOP ligands were synthesized based on a 3-(2'-fluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2(2-halobenzyl)-N-alkylpropanamide scaffold and from experimental screens in rats, with ex vivo LC-MS/MS measures, three ligands were identified for labeling with carbon-11 and evaluation with PET in monkey. Each ligand was labeled by C-11-methylation of an N-desmethyl precursor and studied in monkey under baseline and NOP receptor-preblock conditions. The three radioligands, [C-11] (S) 10a-c, gave similar results. Baseline scans showed high entry of radioactivity into the brain to give a distribution reflecting that expected for NOP receptors. Preblock experiments showed high early peak levels of brain radioactivity, which rapidly declined to a Much lower level than seen in baseline scans, thereby indicating a high level of receptor-specific binding in baseline experiments. Overall, [C-11](S)-10c showed the most favorable receptor-specific signal and kinetics and is now selected for evaluation in human subjects.

The coding sequence for human androgen receptor (AR) was inserted into expression plasmid YEpBUbi-FLAG1, resulting in the plasmid YEpB-UbiFLAG-AR, and the estrogen response element (ERE) on the reporter vector YRpE2 was replaced by an androgen response element (ARE), resulting in the plasmid YRpE2-ARE. Thus, a frilly functional transactivation assay system with P-galactosidase as a reporter gene could be created. Furthermore, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was introduced as an alternative reporter gene that resulted in a sirriplification of the whole assay procedure. For evaluation of both reporter systems, seven steroidal compounds with known AR agonistic properties (5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone, testosterone, androstenedione, 17 alpha-methyltestosterone, progesterone, epitestosterone, and D-norgestrel) were tested, and their potencies obtained in the different assays were compared. Furthermore, potencies from the transactivation assays were compared with IC50 values obtained in radioligand binding assays. The newly developed androgen receptor transactivation assay is a useful tool for characterizing compounds with androgenic activity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, (R)-[C-11]PK11195, the first and most widely used TSPO radioligand has limitations, while the next-generation TSPO radioligands have suffered from high interindividual variability in binding due to a genetic polymorphism in the TSPO gene (rs6971). Herein, we present the biological evaluation of the two enantiomers of [F-18]GE387, which we have previously shown to have low sensitivity to this polymorphism. Methods Dynamic PET scans were conducted in male Wistar rats and female rhesus macaques to investigate the in vivo behaviour of (S)-[F-18]GE387 and (R)-[F-18]GE387. The specific binding of (S)-[F-18]GE387 to TSPO was investigated by pre-treatment with (R)-PK11195. (S)-[F-18]GE387 was further evaluated in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation. Sensitivity to polymorphism of (S)-GE387 was evaluated in genotyped human brain tissue. Results (S)-[F-18]GE387 and (R)-[F-18]GE387 entered the brain in both rats and rhesus macaques. (R)-PK11195 blocked the uptake of (S)-[F-18]GE387 in healthy olfactory bulb and peripheral tissues constitutively expressing TSPO. A 2.7-fold higher uptake of (S)-[F-18]GE387 was found in the inflamed striatum of LPS-treated rodents. In genotyped human brain tissue, (S)-GE387 was shown to bind similarly in low affinity binders (LABs) and high affinity binders (HABs) with a LAB to HAB ratio of 1.8. Conclusion We established that (S)-[F-18]GE387 has favourable kinetics in healthy rats and non-human primates and that it can distinguish inflamed from normal brain regions in the LPS model of neuroinflammation. Crucially, we have reconfirmed its low sensitivity to the TSPO polymorphism on genotyped human brain tissue. Based on these factors, we conclude that (S)-[F-18]GE387 warrants further evaluation with studies on human subjects to assess its suitability as a TSPO PET radioligand for assessing neuroinflammation.

In biodistribution studies, significant amounts (approximately 3% of the injected dose) of (+)-[I-125]pIV accumulated in rat brain, and its retention was prolonged. In blocking studies, the accumulation of (+)-[I-125]pIV in the rat brain was significantly reduced by the coadministration of sigma-ligands such as pentazocine (5.0 mu mol), haloperidol (0.5 mu mol) or SA4503 (0.5 mu mol). The blocking effect of pentazocine (selective sigma-1 ligand) was similar to the blocking effects of SA4503 and haloperidol [nonselective sigma (sigma-1 and (sigma-2) ligands]. Ex vivo autoradiography of the rat brain at 45 min following intravenous injection of (+)-[I-125]PIV showed high localization in brain areas rich in sigma-1 receptors. Thus, the distribution of (+)-[I-125]pIV was thought to bind to (sigma-1 receptors in the CNS in vivo. These results indicate that radioiodinated (+)-plV may have the potential to image sigma-1 receptors in vivo. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Efficacy at the hA(2B) AR and antagonism of selected ligands at the hA(3) AR were also assessed through cAMP experiments. All of the synthesized molecules exhibited high affinity at the hA(3) AR (K-i values ranging from 1.46 to 44.8 nM), as well as remarkable selectivity versus A(1), A(2A), and A(2B) AR subtypes. Compound (R)-4-allyl-8-ethyl-7,8-dihydro2-(3-methoxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-1H-imidazo[2,1-i]purin-5(4H)-one (R-33) was found to be the most potent and selective ligand of the series (K-i hA(3) = 1.46 nM, K-i hA(2A)/K-i hA(3) > 3425; IC50 hA(2B)/K-i hA(3) > 3425; K-i hA(1)/K-i hA(3) = 1729). Molecular modeling studies were helpful in rationalizing the available structure-activity relationships along with the selectivity profiles of the new series of ligands.

J	Zhang, NJ; Tomizawa, M; Casida, JE				Zhang, NJ; Tomizawa, M; Casida, JE			<i>Drosophila</i> nicotinic receptors:: evidence for imidacloprid insecticide and α-bungarotoxin binding to distinct sites	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						nicotinic receptor; alpha-bungarotoxin; imidacloprid; neonicotinoids; Drosophila	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION; HIGH-AFFINITY; CO-ASSEMBLE; SUBUNIT; SPECIFICITY; SELECTIVITY; D-ALPHA-3; CLONING	The principal mammalian brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are the alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BGT)-insensitive alpha4beta2 and the alpha-BGT-sensitive alpha7 subtypes assayed with radiolabeled nicotinoids and alpha-BGT, respectively. Drosophila head membranes bind the insecticide radioligand [H-3]imidacloprid ([H-3]IMI) and [H-3]alpha-BGT with K-D 5.7 and 2.7 nM and B-max 980 and 1400 fmol/mg protein, respectively. The hypothesis that [H-3]IMI at 2.5 or 20 nM and [H-3]alpha-BGT at 1 or 10 nM bind to distinct sites or subtypes is tested by using these radioligands alone and together in simultaneous dual binding experiments. These studies show no interference by one radioligand in the binding of the other one, i.e., independent binding, and that both unlabeled IMI and alpha-BGT give biphasic displacement curves. The pharmacological profiles of [H-3]IMI and [H-3]alpha-BGT suggest distinct binding sites for the two radioligands. These findings are consistent with those obtained with hybrid receptors assembled from Drosophila u subunits and a vertebrate beta subunit and with immunological and protein biochemical approaches. This study, therefore, provides direct evidence for distinct IMI- and alpha-BGT-sensitive sites or subtypes in Drosophila brain. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radioligand binding studies were performed in rats to assess the presence of the receptor, while in vivo microdialysis studies were performed to examine its role in somatostatin release. CH-275, which is selective for sst(1), MK-678, selective for sst(2) and L-803,087, selective for sst(4) receptors displaced [I-125]-Tyr(11)-somatostatin specific binding in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 75, 0.21 and 11 nM, respectively. Infusion of CH-275 (10(-5), 10(-6) or 10(-7) M) in the NAc of freely moving rats resulted in a decrease in somatostatin levels only at the concentration of 10-5 M. This effect was reversed by 10(-5) M of the selective sst, antagonist SRA-880. The sst, agonist L-797,591 (10(-5) M) mimicked the effect of CH-275, while MK-678 and L-803,087 at the same concentration were unable to influence somatostatin levels. These results provide functional evidence to demonstrate that the sst, receptor modulates somatostatin release in the basal ganglia. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

[I-125]iodoMLA binding to rat cerebral cortex membranes was saturable and reversible and its specific binding represented approximately 70-80% of the total binding. [I-125]iodoMLA labeled a single site with K-d = 1.8 +/- 0.4 nM and B-max = 68 +/- 3 fmol/mg protein. Kinetic analysis revealed a t(1/2) for association and dissociation of 10.5 +/- 3.1 and 10.3 +/- 1.6 min, respectively. Pharmacological characterization of [I-125]iodoMLA binding indicated that it was specific for the alpha(7) nAChR. In vitro brain region binding studies revealed greater binding in regions known to contain high numbers Of alpha(7) nAChRs. The analysis of the biodistribution of intravenously administered [I-125] iodoMLA indicated that it was rapidly cleared and exhibited poor brain penetration; nevertheless, the levels of [I-125]iodoMLA in alpha(7) nAChR-rich target regions were significantly increased compared to the nontarget region (cerebellum) 60-120 min after administration. No metabolism of MLA by human liver S9 fraction was detected. Our results suggest that [I-125] iodoMLA will be a useful radioligand to study the alpha(7) nAChR in vitro and in vivo.

Structure-activity relationship of pyrazol-4-yl- pyridine derivatives and identification of a radiofluorinated probe for imaging the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4	ACTA PHARMACEUTICA SINICA B			English	Article						Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; Positron emission tomography; Neuroimaging; Neuropharmacology; Neurological disorders	POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; IN-VIVO VALIDATION; PRECLINICAL CANDIDATE; DISCOVERY; XANOMELINE; CHALLENGES; AGONIST; OPPORTUNITIES; POTENTIATORS; MECHANISMS	There is an accumulating body of evidence implicating the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor 4 (M4) in schizophrenia and dementia with Lewy bodies, however, a clinically validated M4 positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand is currently lacking. As such, the aim of this study was to develop a suitable M4 PET ligand that allows the non-invasive visualization of M4 in the brain. Structure-activity relationship studies of pyrazol-4-yl-pyridine derivates led to the discovery of target compound 12 - a subtype-selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM). The radiofluorinated analogue, [18F]12, was synthesized in 28 +/- 10% radiochemical yield, >37 GBq/mmol and an excellent radiochem-ical purity >99%. Initial in vitro autoradiograms on rodent brain sections were performed in the absence of carbachol and showed moderate specificity as well as a low selectivity of [18F]12 for the M4-rich stria-tum. However, in the presence of carbachol, a significant increase in tracer binding was observed in the rat striatum, which was reduced by >60% under blocking conditions, thus indicating that orthosteric ligand interaction is required for efficient binding of [18F]12 to the allosteric site. Remarkably, however, the presence of carbachol was not required for high specific binding in the non-human primate (NHP) and human striatum, and did not further improve the specificity and selectivity of [18F]12 in higher species. These results pointed towards significant species-differences and paved the way for a preliminary PET study in NHP, where peak brain uptake of [18F]12 was found in the putamen and temporal cortex. In conclusion, we report on the identification and preclinical development of the first radiofluorinated M4 PET radioligand with promising attributes. The availability of a clinically validated M4 PET radioligand harbors potential to facilitate drug development and provide a useful diagnostic tool for non-invasive im-aging.(c) 2023 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

A simplified method for quantifying radioligand binding in target regions is to employ the cerebellum as a reference (CB-ref) on the assumption that the cerebellum has minimal tau pathologies. This procedure is typically valid in AD, while FTLD disorders exemplified by progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are characterized by occasional tau accumulations in the cerebellum, hampering the application of CB-ref. The present study aimed to establish an optimal method for defining reference tissues on 18F-PM-PBB3-PET images of AD and non-AD tauopathy brains. We developed a new algorithm to extract reference voxels with a low likelihood of containing tau deposits from gray matter (GM-ref) or white matter (WM-ref) by a bimodal fit to an individual, voxel-wise histogram of the radioligand retentions and applied it to 18F-PM-PBB3-PET data obtained from age-matched 40 healthy controls (HCs) and 23 CE, 40 PSP, and five other tau-positive FTLD patients. PET images acquired at 90-110 min after injection were averaged and co-registered to corresponding magnetic resonance imaging space. Subsequently, we generated standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) images estimated by CB-ref, GM-ref and WM-ref, respectively, and then compared the diagnostic performances. GM-ref and WM-ref covered a broad area in HCs and were free of voxels located in regions known to bear high tau burdens in AD and PSP patients. However, radioligand retentions in WM-ref exhibited age-related declines. GM-ref was unaffected by aging and provided SUVR images with higher contrast than CB-ref in FTLD patients with suspected and confirmed corticobasal degeneration. The methodology for determining reference tissues as optimized here improves the accuracy of 18F-PM-PBB3-PET measurements of tau burdens in a wide range of neurodegenerative illnesses.

This article describes the preclinical in vitro and in vivo characterization of 3 novel compounds-RO6958948, RO6931643, and RO6924963-that bind specifically to tau aggregates and have the potential to become PET tracers for future human use. Methods: RO6958948, RO6931643, and RO6924963 were identified as high-affinity competitors at the H-3-T808 binding site on native tau aggregates in human late-stage AD brain tissue. Binding of tritiated compounds to brain tissue sections of AD patients and healthy controls was analyzed by macro-and microautoradiography and by costaining of tau aggregates and A beta plaques on the same tissue section using specific antibodies. All 3 tracer candidates were radiolabeled with a PET nuclide and tested in vivo in tau-naive baboons to assess brain uptake, distribution, clearance, and metabolism. Results: H-3-RO6958948, H-3-RO6931643, and H-3-RO6924963 bound with high affinity and specificity to tau aggregates, clearly lacking affinity for concomitant A beta plaques in human AD Braak V tissue sections. The specificity of all 3 radio-ligands for tau aggregates was supported, first, by binding patterns in AD sections comparable to the tau-specific radioligand H-3-T808; second, by very low nonspecific binding in brain tissue devoid of tau pathology, excluding significant radioligand binding to any other central nervous system target; and third, by macroscopic and microscopic colocalization and quantitative correlation of radioligand binding and tau antibody staining on the same tissue section. RO6958948, RO6931643, and RO6924963 were successfully radiolabeled with a PET nuclide at high specific activity, radiochemical purity, and yield. After intravenous administration of F-18-RO6958948, C-11-RO6931643, and C-11-RO6924963 to baboons, PET scans indicated good brain entry, rapid washout, and a favorable metabolism pattern. Conclusion: F-18-RO6958948, C-11-RO6931643, and C-11-RO6924963 are promising PET tracers for visualization of tau aggregates in AD. Head-to-head comparison and validation of these tracer candidates in AD patients and healthy controls will be reported in due course.

We describe here the autoradiographic evaluation of [F-18]FMe-McN in the brain of rats and pigs. Autoradiographic studies of [F-18]FMe-McN performed on rat and pig brain in vitro showed a high accumulation of radioactivity in the regions rich in SERT, such as amygdala, hypothalamus, superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus. various nuclei of thalamus and substantia nigra. The binding of [F-18]FMe-McN was reduced by citalopram, a highly selective inhibitor for SERT. Similar regional specific binding densities of [F-18]FMe-McN were observed in both species. The regional distribution and specific binding of this radiotracer correlates well with the distribution and regional brain binding of [H-3]citalopram. Region-to-cerebellum ratios of [F-18]FMe-McN in vitro reached a maximum value of 20.6 in the rat and 14.5 in the pig. In addition, ex vivo autoradiography of the rat brain was performed 90 min after i.v. administration of [F-18]FMe-McN. The highest regional uptake of [F-18]FMe-McN was observed in the hypothalamic area, substantia nigra and amygdaloid area. There is a high correlation between the in vitro and in vivo binding. The region-to-cerebellum ratio in vivo reached a maximum value of 5.1 in the substantia nigra, the highest yet reported for an F-18-labelled SERT tracer in vivo in this region. Furthermore, the distribution volume of [F-18]FMe-McN calculated from the PET data in various regions of the porcine brain is highly correlated with the SERT density as determined by in vitro autoradiography with [H-3]citalopram. Thus, [F-18]FMe-McN has a clear potential as a radiotracer for studies of the SERT distribution in man with PET. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V./ECNP. All rights reserved.

Although [H-3]1 is commercially available and its synthesis via tritiodebromination has been reported, the market price of this radioligand and the laborious synthesis of corresponding bromo-intermediate potentially preclude its widespread use in biochemical, pharmacological, and pathological studies in research lab settings. We exploit recent reports on hydrogen-isotope exchange (HIE) reactions in tertiary benzenesulfonamides where the sulfonamide represents an ortho-directing group that facilitates C-H activation in the presence of homogenous iridium(I) catalysts. Herein, we report a time- and cost-efficient method for the tritium late-stage labeling of compound 1-a remarkably electron-poor substrate owing to the tertiary trifluoroethylsulfonamide moiety. Under a straightforward HIE condition using a commercially available Kerr-type NHC Ir(I) complex, [(cod)Ir (NHC)Cl], the reaction with 1 afforded a specific activity of 10.8 Ci/mmol. Additionally, alternative HIE conditions using the heterogeneous catalyst of Ir-black provided sufficient 0.72 D-enrichment of 1 but unexpectedly failed while repeating with tritium gas.

The purposes of this study were to estimate the radiation-absorbed doses of F-18-SP203 in humans and to determine from the distribution of radioactivity in bone structures with various proportions of bone and red marrow whether F-18-SP203 undergoes defluorination. Whole-body images were acquired for 5 h after injecting F-18-SP203 in seven healthy humans. Urine was collected at various time points. Radiation-absorbed doses were estimated by the Medical Internal Radiation Dose scheme. After injecting F-18-SP203, the two organs with highest radiation exposure were urinary bladder wall and gallbladder wall, consistent with both urinary and fecal excretion. In the skeleton, most of the radioactivity was in bone structures that contain red marrow and not in those without red marrow. Although the dose to red marrow (30.9 mu Sv/MBq) was unusually high, the effective dose (17.8 mu Sv/MBq) of F-18-SP203 was typical of that of other F-18 radiotracers. F-18-SP203 causes an effective dose in humans typical of several other F-18 radioligands and undergoes little defluorination.

In the present study we examined the possible effect of the antimuscarinic drugs of atropine sulfate, scopolamine hydrobromide, p-fluoro-hexa-hydro-sila-difenidol (p-F-HHSiD, the M-3-receptor antagonist) and pirenzepine (the M-1-receptor antagonist) on alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (AR). Atropine and p-F-HHSiD relaxed the alpha(1)-AR agonist methoxamine-induced contraction of the rabbit portal vein in a concentration-dependent manner; however, scopolamine and pirenzepine had no such inhibitory effect. Radioligand binding studies with the alpha(1)-AR ligand 2-[2-(4-hydroxy-3-[I-125] iodo-phenyl)ethylaminomethyl]-alpha-tetralone ([1251]HEAT) in membrane preparations from mouse whole brain showed that atropine (pK(i)=5.33) and p-F-HHSiD (pK(i)=5.88) had higher affinities than scopolamine (pK(i)=3.17) and pirenzepine (pK(i)<2.70). Furthermore, atropine and p-F-HHSiD had higher affinities for all human cloned alpha(1)-ARs than scopolamine and pirenzepine. The results show that the antimuscarinic drugs atropine and p-F-HHSiD have a direct but weak antagonistic activity against alpha(1)-ARs.

The use of trimethylammonium as a leaving group in nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions has proven to be a versatile and efficient strategy, and offers several advantages over other leaving groups. Here, we report the synthetic strategy for the preparation of a precursor, as a trimethylammonium iodide salt, and its use in the radiosynthesis to 6-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380. Preliminary compartative PET studies of 6-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 and 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 were carried out in baboon to examine their suitability as tracers for studying nAChR system.

Pretherapeutic estimated glomerular filtration rate predicts development of chronic kidney disease in patients receiving PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy	PROSTATE			English	Article						chronic kidney disease; prostate carcinoma; PSMA; radioligand therapy; Tc-99m-MAG3	RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; I-AND-T; RENAL-FUNCTION; NORMAL ORGANS; DOSIMETRY; LU-PSMA-617; EXPRESSION; EXPERIENCE	Background Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) may be associated with renal toxicity. We aimed to identify predictive parameters for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing RLT. Methods In 46 mCRPC patients scheduled for Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, pretherapeutic estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR [ml/min/1.73 m(2)]), Tc-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc-99m-MAG3) clearance and baseline Ga-68-PSMA-ligand positron emission tomography (PET)-derived renal cortical uptake and PSMA-tumor volume (TV) were determined. We tested the predictive capability of these parameters and clinical risk factors for the occurrence of CKD (defined as CTCAE vers. 5.0 grade 2 or higher) during follow-up. Results After 4 +/- 3 cycles of RLT average eGFR declined from 76 +/- 17 to 72 +/- 20 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (p = 0.003). Increased estimated renal radiation dose (eRRD) was significantly associated with renal functional decline (p = 0.008). During follow-up, 16/46 (30.4%) developed CKD grade 2 (no grade 3 or higher). In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, pretherapeutic eGFR was highly accurate in identifying the occurrence of CKD vs no CKD with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.945 (p < 0.001; best threshold, 77 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), followed by Tc-99m-MAG3-derived tubular extraction rate (TER; AUC, 0.831, p < 0.001; best threshold, 200 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Renal PET signal (p = 0.751) and PSMA-TV (p = 0.942), however, were not predictive. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed adverse renal outcome for patients with lower eGFR (p = 0.001) and lower scintigraphy-derived TER (p = 0.009), with pretherapeutic eGFR emerging as the sole predictive parameter in multivariate analysis (p = 0.007). Conclusion Serious adverse renal events are not a frequent phenomenon after PSMA-targeted RLT. However, in patients developing moderate CKD after RLT, pretherapeutic eGFR is an independent predictor for renal impairment during follow-up.

For G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the binding kinetics of ligands are typically determined using association binding experiments in competition with radiolabel led probes, followed by analysis with the widely used competitive binding kinetics theory developed by Motulsky and Mahan. Despite this, the influence of the radioligand binding kinetics on the kinetic parameters derived for the ligands tested is often overlooked. To address this, binding rate constants for a series of histamine H-1 receptor (H1R) antagonists were determined using radioligands with either slow (low k(off)) or fast (high k(off)) dissociation characteristics. A correlation was observed between the probe-specific datasets for the kinetic binding affinities, association rate constants and dissociation rate constants. However, the magnitude and accuracy of the binding rate constant-values was highly dependent on the used radioligand probe. Further analysis using recently developed fluorescent binding methods corroborates the finding that the Motulsky-Mahan methodology is limited by the employed assay conditions. The presented data suggest that kinetic parameters of GPCR ligands depend largely on the characteristics of the probe used and results should therefore be viewed within the experimental context and limitations of the applied methodology.

Cloning and pharmacological characterization of the equine adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; NF-KAPPA-B; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASES; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; C-DELTA; RADIOLIGAND; NEUTROPHILS; ANTAGONISTS; MEDIATORS; AFFINITY	The aim of this study was to establish a heterologous expression system for the equine adenosine A(3) receptor (eA(3)-R) in an effort to ascertain its pharmacologic profile. Initially, radioligand binding assays identified clones expressing the eA(3)-R in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK) based on the specific binding of [I-125]AB-MECA. Subsequently, adenylate cyclase assays were utilized to demonstrate functional coupling of the eA(3)-R to the G-protein/adenylate cyclase system. Equilibrium competition binding assays were then performed using selective and non-selective A(3) agonists and antagonists. Results from these experiments revealed a rank order of agonist potency to be IB-MECA > NECA > CGS21680, and an antagonist potency of MRS1220 > ZM241385 > 8-p-sulphophenyltheophylline; these rank orders were in agreement with that of other mammalian A(3)-R's. Lastly, NF-kappa B reporter gene assays revealed an IB-MECA concentration-dependent inhibition of TNF alpha-stimulated NF-kappa B activity. These results indicate that the heterologously expressed eA(3)-R is functional, has a pharmacological profile similar to that of other mammalian A(3) receptors, and its activation has an inhibitory effect on a key regulatory pathway in the inflammatory response. Thus, the eA(3)-R may serve as a pharmacological target in the treatment of equine inflammatory disease.

SG toxicity is assessed clinically by the severity of patient-reported xerostomia, but this parameter can be challenging to objectively quantify. Therefore, we explored the feasibility of using SG volume as a biomarker for toxicity. In 21 patients with late-stage metastatic resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), the PSMA volume and ligand uptake of SG were analyzed retrospectively before and after two cycles of Lu-177-PSMA (LuPSMA; cohort A) and before and after one cycle of Ac-225-PSMA-617 (AcPSMA, cohort B). Mean Volume-SG in cohort A was 59 +/- 13 vs. 54 +/- 16 mL (-10%, p = 0.4), and in cohort B, it was 50 +/- 13 vs. 40 +/- 11 mL (-20%, p = 0.007), respectively. A statistically significant decrease in the activity concentration in the SG was only observed in group B (SUVmean: 9.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 5.3 +/- 1.8, p < 0.0001; vs. A: SUVmean: 11.2 +/- 3.3 vs. 11.1 +/- 3.5, p = 0.8). SG volume and PSMA-ligand uptake are promising markers to monitor the SG toxicity after a PSMA RLT.

PET measurement in NHP can be repeated, and a difference in radioligand kinetics has previously been observed between the first and second PET measurement on the same day using sevoflurane anesthesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of prolonged sevoflurane anesthesia on kinetics and binding potential (BPND) of [C-11]raclopride in NHP. Three cynomolgus monkeys underwent two to three PET measurements with [C-11]raclopride under continuous sevoflurane anesthesia on the same day. The concentration of sevoflurane was adjusted according to the general conditions and safety parameters of the NHP. Time to peak (TTP) radioactivity in the striatum was estimated from time-activity curves (TACs). The BPND in the striatum was calculated by the simplified reference tissue model using the cerebellum as reference region. In each NHP, the TTP became shorter in the later PET measurements than in the first one. Across all measurements (n = 8), concentration of sevoflurane correlated with TTP (Spearman's rho = - 0.79, p = 0.03), but not with BPND (rho = - 0.25, p = 0.55). These data suggest that sevoflurane affects the shape of TACs but has no evident effect on BPND in consecutive PET measurements.

It is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and has been suggested as a target for antibody-based radioligand therapy. As PSMA expression so far has not been systematically analyzed in soft tissue tumors, the current study aims at investigating a large cohort of different subtypes. Methods and Results: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect PSMA expression in 779 samples of soft tissue tumors and Ewing sarcoma as a primary bone malignancy. CD34 coexpression was employed to study PSMA expression in the neovasculature. PSMA expression was found in the tumor-associated neovasculature of 151/779 soft tissue/bone tumors (19.38%) and was more frequent in malignant tumors compared to tumors with intermediate or benign biological potential (p= 0.078). Strong neovascular PSMA expression was predominantly observed in subsets of different sarcomas including 3/20 rhabdomyosarcomas (15%), 4/21 malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (19.05%), 6/16 synovial sarcomas (35.29%) and 6/33 undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (18.18%). Conclusion: We conclude that PSMA is expressed in the neovasculature of a subset of soft tissue tumors to a variable extent. Our observation of strong PSMA expression predominantly occurring in sarcomas might provide a rationale to evaluate PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy in these entities.

Exploring a potential palonosetron allosteric binding site in the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Serotonin receptor; Allosteric binding site; Site-directed mutagenesis; Radioligand binding; FlexStation assays; Palonosetron; Computational studies	SEROTONIN-RECEPTOR; SUBUNIT; STOICHIOMETRY; RECOGNITION; ANTAGONIST; INTERFACE; RESIDUES; 5-HT(3)A; AGONISTS; REVEALS	Palonosetron (Aloxi) is a potent second generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonist whose mechanism of action is not yet fully understood. Palonosetron acts at the 5-HT3 receptor binding site but recent computational studies indicated other possible sites of action in the extracellular domain. To test this hypothesis we mutated a series of residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit (Tyr(73), Phe(130), Ser(163), and Asp(165)) and in the 5-HT3B receptor subunit (His(73), Phe(130), Glu(170), and Tyr(143)) that were previously predicted by in silico docking studies to interact with palonosetron. Homomeric (5-HT(3)A) and heteromeric (5-HT(3)AB) receptors were then expressed in HEK293 cells to determine the potency of palonosetron using both fluorimetric and radioligand methods to test function and ligand binding, respectively. The data show that the substitutions have little or no effect on palonosetron inhibition of 5-HT-evoked responses or binding. In contrast, substitutions in the orthosteric binding site abolish palonosetron binding. Overall, the data support a binding site for palonosetron at the classic orthosteric binding pocket between two 5-HT(3)A receptor subunits but not at allosteric sites previously identified by in silico modelling and docking.

N-(2-(4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)-N-methylpyridin-2-amine was synthesised and evaluated for brain imaging subsequent to radiolabelling with [C-11] radioisotope via methylation process in 98.9% purity and 52 +/- 6% yield (decay corrected). The specific activity was in the range of 72-93 GBq/mu mol. The haemolysis of blood was 2-5% for initial 4 hr and remained < 10% after 24 h of incubation indicating low toxicity. In vitro autoradiograms after coincubation with unlabelled ligand confirmed the high uptake of the PET radioligand in the mGluR1 receptor rich regions. The PET as well as biodistribution studies also showed high activity in the brain with a direct correlation between receptor abundance distribution pattern and tracer activity. The biodistribution analyses revealed initial high brain uptake (4.18 +/- 0.48). The highest uptake was found in cerebellum (SUV 4.7 +/- 0.2), followed by thalamus (SUV 3.5 +/- 0.1), and striatum (SUV 3 +/- 0.1). In contrast, pons had negligible tracer activity. The high uptake observed in all the regions with known mGluR1 activity indicates suitability of the ligand for mGluR1 imaging.	[Mann, Garima; Kadiyala, K.

Three mutant receptors, A229E in TM6 and R108A and R108K in the DRY motif of TM3, were found to be constitutively active in both functional assays. The potency of the A, agonist CI-IB-MECA (1-chloro-N-6-(3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide) in PLC activation was enhanced by at least an order of magnitude over wild type (EC50 951 nM) in R108A and A229E mutant receptors. CI-IB-MECA was much less potent (>10-fold) in C88F, Y109F, and Y282F and mutants or inactive following double mutation of the DRY motif. The degree of constitutive activation was more pronounced for the AC signaling pathway than for the PLC signaling pathway. The results indicated that specific locations within the TMs proximal to the cytosolic region were responsible for constraining the receptor in a G protein-uncoupled conformation.

Radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA-DKFZ-617 (Lu-PSMA) is a targeted therapy for metastatic PC. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the side effects and the response rate of 24 hormone and/or chemorefractory PC patients with a mean age of 75.2 years (range: 64-82) with distant metastases and progressive disease according to the PSA level, who were treated with Lu-PSMA. Median PSA was 522 ng/ml (range: 17-2360). Forty-six cycles of Lu-PSMA were performed. Of the 24 patients, 22 received two cycles. Eight weeks after the first cycle of Lu-PSMA therapy 79.1% experienced a decline in PSA level. Eight weeks after the second cycle of Lu-PSMA therapy 68.2% experienced a decline in PSA relative to the baseline value. Apart from two cases of grade 3 anemia, there was no relevant hemato-or nephrotoxicity (grade 3 or 4). These results confirmed that Lu-PSMA is a safe treatment option for metastatic PC patients and has a low toxicity profile. A positive response to therapy in terms of decline in PSA occurs in about 70% of patients.

Dual-Point Competition Association Assay: A Fast and High-Throughput Kinetic Screening Method for Assessing Ligand-Receptor Binding Kinetics	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Article						GPCR; adenosine A(1) receptor; kinetic rate index; binding kinetics; residence time	TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; ANTAGONISTS; CLASSIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE; RADIOLIGAND; CANDESARTAN; DISCOVERY; EFFICACY	The concept of ligand-receptor binding kinetics is emerging as an important parameter in the early phase of drug discovery. Since the currently used kinetic assays are laborious and low throughput, we developed a method that enables fast and large format screening. It is a so-called dual-point competition association assay, which measures radioligand binding at two different time points in the absence or presence of unlabeled competitors. Specifically, this assay yields the kinetic rate index (KRI), which is a measure for the binding kinetics of the unlabeled ligands screened. As a prototypical drug target, the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R) was chosen for assay validation and optimization. A screen with 35 high-affinity A(1)R antagonists yielded seven compounds with a KRI value above 1.0, which indicated a relatively slow dissociation from the target. All other compounds had a KRI value below or equal to 1.0, predicting a relatively fast dissociation rate. Several compounds were selected for follow-up kinetic quantifications in classical kinetic assays and were shown to have kinetic rates that corresponded to their KRI values. The dual-point assay and KRI value may have general applicability at other G-protein-coupled receptors, as well as at drug targets from other protein families.	[Guo, Dong; van Dorp, Erika J.

J	Alt, E				Alt, E			Development of a radioligand assay for the quantification of the specific prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub>-binding in ischemic ulcers	ACTA MEDICA AUSTRIACA			German	Article						peripheral arterial occlusive disease; leg ulcer; prostaglandin E-1; specific binding; granulation tissue		Ulcers of the lower extremities are of immense socioeconomical importance. Prevention and therapy of these trophic lesion are hence of great interest. In granulation tissue of ischemic ulcers Laser Doppler flow was previously shown to be higher compared to that in ischemic/adjacent skin or in ulcer without granulation tissue. Intravenous infusion of prostaglandin El significantly increased Laser Doppler flow. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis whether the increased baseline and prostaglandin El-stimulated perfusion of granulation tissue is due to an increased number of prostaglandin El-receptors in granulation tissue. Therefore, a radioligand binding assay was developed. In an initial pilot study the density of the prostaglandin E-1-receptors in granulation tissue of ulcers was compared to that in ischemic/adjacent skin in 8 patients suffering from peripheral arterial occlusive disease requiring debridement or amputation of limbs because of ischemic lesions. The amount of specific binding sites detected was not significantly different between granulation tissue and ischemic/ adjacent ulcer tissue. However it cannot be excluded that a possible difference might be detectable with more sensitive assays.

To test compound 1 as a TSPO PET imaging agent in vivo, 2-(2-(4-(2-[F-18]fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-6,8-dichloroimidazo[1,2-a]pyridin-3-yl)-N, N-dipropylacetamide ([F-18]1; [F-18]CB251) was synthesized by nucleophilic aliphatic substitution in a single-step radiolabelling procedure with a 11.1 +/- 3.5% (n = 14, decay corrected) radiochemical yield and over 99% radiochemical purity. In animal PET imaging studies, [F-18]CB251 provided a clearly visible image of the inflammatory lesion with the binding potential of the specifically bound radioligand relative to the non-displaceable radioligand in tissue (BPND 1.83 +/- 0.18), in a neuroinflammation rat model based on the unilateral stereotaxic injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), comparable to that of [C-11]PBR28 (BPND 1.55 +/- 0.41). [F-18]CB251 showed moderate tumour uptake (1.96 +/- 0.11%ID/g at 1 h post injection) in human glioblastoma U87-MG xenografts. These results suggest that [F-18]CB251 is a promising TSPO PET imaging agent for neuroinflammation and TSPO-rich cancers.

D-1 receptor-mediated striatal imbalance resulted from a significantly higher agonist affinity in the left striatum. D-1 receptors heteromerize with dopamine D-3 receptors, which are considered therapeutic targets for dyskinesia in parkinsonian patients. Expression of both D-3 and D-1-D-3 receptor heteromers were increased in samples from 6-hydroxy-dopamine-hemilesioned rats rendered dyskinetic by treatment with 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl-l-alanine (l-DOPA). Similar findings were obtained using striatal samples from primates. Radioligand binding studies in the presence of a D-3 agonist led in dyskinetic, but not in lesioned or l-DOPA-treated rats, to a higher dopamine sensitivity. Upon D-3-receptor activation, the affinity of agonists for binding to the right striatal D-1 receptor increased. Excess dopamine coming from l-DOPA medication likely activates D-3 receptors thus making right and left striatal D-1 receptors equally responsive to dopamine. These results show that dyskinesia occurs concurrently with a right/left striatal balance in D-1 receptor-mediated neurotransmission.

The deuterated analogue of (S)desmethylcitalopram, (S)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(3-methylamino-[3-d(2)]-propyl)-1,3-di-hydro-isobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile (11), was synthesized in a multi-step synthesis from escitalopram (4) and used as precursor in the synthesis of [C-11]-13. In analogy with the reported gas phase synthesis of [C-11]methyl iodide the first gas phase synthesis of [C-11]Methyl iodide-d(3) is reported. The H-1/H-2 kinetic isotope effect related to the synthesized compounds were investigated in ex vivo rat studies, where the brain regions of interest to cerebellum ratios of the tracers,[C-11]-4, [C-11]-12 and [C-11]-13 were compared. The ex vivo data indicated no significant differences in binding in any of the investigated brain regions after injection of the three tracers. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Previous studies have shown promising results for F-18-FE-PE2I as a suitable radioligand for DAT imaging. In this study, we investigated the whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry of F-18-FE-PE2I in healthy volunteers to support its utility as a suitable PET imaging agent for the DAT. Methods: Five healthy volunteers were given a mean activity of 2.5 MBq/kg, and 3 PET scans, head to thigh, were performed immediately after injection followed by 4 whole-body PET/CT scans between 0.5 and 6 h after injection. Blood samples were drawn in connection with the whole-body scans, and all urine was collected until 6 h after injection. Volumes of interest were delineated around 17 organs on all images, and the areas under the time-activity curves were calculated to obtain the total number of decays in the organs. The absorbed doses to organs and the effective dose were calculated using the software IDAC. Results: The highest activity concentration was observed in the liver (0.9%-1.2% injected activity/100 g) up to 30 min after injection. At later time points, the highest concentration was seen in the gallbladder (1.1%-0.1% injected activity/100 g). The activity excreted with urine ranged between 23% and 34%, with a mean of 28%. The urinary bladder received the highest absorbed dose (119 mu Gy/MBq), followed by the liver (46 mu Gy/MBq). The effective dose was 23 mu Sv/MBq (range, 19-28 mu Sv/MBq), resulting in an effective dose of 4.6 mSv for an administered activity of 200 MBq. Conclusion: The effective dose is within the same order of magnitude as other commonly used PET imaging agents as well as DAT agents. The reasonable effective dose, together with the previously reported favorable characteristics for DAT imaging and quantification, indicates that F-18-FE-PE2I is a suitable radioligand for DAT imaging.

This study provides the preclinical evaluation of C-11-JNJ-54173717, a PET tracer for P2X7R in both rats and nonhuman primates. Methods: C-11-JNJ-54173717 is a high-affinity radiotracer for the human P2X7R (hP2X7R). Biodistribution and radiometabolite studies were performed. Viral vectors encoding either enhanced green fluorescent protein-hP2X7R or 3flag-hP2X7R were engineered and validated in cell culture. hP2X7R was regionally overexpressed in the rat striatum after stereotactic injection of viral vectors. Dynamic small-animal PET studies were performed in vector-injected rats and in healthy monkeys using C-11-JNJ-54173717. Results: The affinity of JNJ-54173717 was 1.6 +/- 0.1 nM in a rat cortex P2X7R membrane binding assay. In a functional assay at the recombinant human and rat P2X7R orthologs, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of JNJ-54173717 was 4.2 +/- 0.01 nM and 7.6 +/- 0.01 nM, respectively. The rat biodistribution study showed that C-11-JNJ-54173717 crossed the blood-brain barrier and was cleared from plasma mainly via the hepatobiliary pathway. A polar radiometabolite was found in rat plasma. No radiometabolites were detected in rat brain. Dynamic small-animal PET showed binding of C-11-JNJ-54173717 in the striatum expressing hP2X7R, with rapid washout from the noninjected control striatum and other brain regions. Likewise, C-11-JNJ-54173717 PET signal was blocked by a chemically distinct P2X7R ligand, indicating specific binding to P2X7R in the monkey brain. Conclusion: JNJ-54173717 is a high-affinity P2X7R antagonist. An animal rat model stably expressing hP2X7R was developed and validated, identifying favorable characteristics for C-11-JNJ-54173717 as a PET radioligand for in vivo visualization of hP2X7R. C-11-JNJ-54173717 selectively visualized P2X7R in the monkey brain, and this radioligand will be further evaluated in a clinical setting to study P2X7R expression levels in neurodegenerative disorders.

Specific α4β2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Binding of [F-18]Nifene in the Rhesus Monkey	SYNAPSE			English	Article						nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; PET; nifene	GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; PET; QUANTIFICATION; SMOKING; LOCALIZATION; DENSITY	Objective: [F-18]Nifene is a PET radioligand developed to image alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) in the brain. This work assesses the in vivo binding and imaging characteristics of [F-18]nifene in rhesus monkeys for the development of PET experiments examining nAChR binding. Methods: Dynamic PET imaging experiments with [F-18]nifene were acquired in four anesthetized Macaca mulatta (rhesus) monkeys using a microPET P4 scanner. Data acquisition was initiated with a bolus injection of 109 +/- 17 MBq [F-18] nifene and the time course of the radioligand in the brain was measured for up to 120 min. For two experiments, a displacement dose of (-)nicotine (0.03 mg kg(-1), i.v.) was given 45-60 min post injection and followed 30 min later with a second [F-18]nifene injection to measure radioligand nondisplaceable uptake. Time activity curves were extracted in the regions of the antereoventral thalamus (AVT), lateral geniculate nucleus region (LGN), frontal cortex, and the cerebellum (CB). Results: The highest levels of [F-18]nifene uptake were observed in the AVT and LGN. Target-to-CB ratios reached maximum values of 3.3 +/- 0.4 in the AVT and 3.2 +/- 0.3 in the LGN 30-45 min postinjection. Significant binding of [F-18]nifene was observed in the subiculum, insula cortex, temporal cortex, cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, striatum, and midbrain areas. The (-)nicotine displaced bound [F-18]nifene to near background levels within 15 min postdrug injection. No discernable displacement was observed in the CB, suggesting its potential as a reference region. Logan graphical estimates using the CB as a reference region yielded binding potentials of 1.6 +/- 0.2 in the AVT and 1.3 +/- 0.1 in the LGN. The postnicotine injection displayed uniform nondisplaceable uptake of [F-18]nifene throughout gray and white brain matter. Conclusions: [F-18]Nifene exhibits rapid equilibration and a moderately high target to background binding profile in the alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR rich regions of the brain, thus providing favorable imaging characteristics as a PET radiotracer for nAChR assay.

Evaluation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]RoSMA-18-d<sub>6</sub> as a CB2 PET Radioligand in Nonhuman Primates	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						cannabinoid type 2 receptor; positron emission tomography; translational molecular imaging; tracer development; inflammation	CANNABINOID TYPE-2 RECEPTOR; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; VIVO EVALUATION; HIGH-AFFINITY; BONE-MARROW; RADIOTRACER; INVOLVEMENT; DERIVATIVES; DISCOVERY	The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) has been implicated in a variety of central and peripheral inflammatory diseases, prompting significant interest in the development of CB2-targeted diagnostic and therapeutic agents. A validated positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging CB2 in the living human brain as well as in peripheral tissues is currently lacking. As part of our research program, we have recently identified the trisubstituted pyridine, [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6), which proved to be highly suitable for in vitro and in vivo mapping of CB2 in rodents. The aim of this study was to assess the performance characteristics of [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) in nonhuman primates (NHPs) to pave the way for clinical translation. [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) was synthesized from the respective tosylate precursor according to previously reported procedures. In vitro autoradiograms with NHP spleen tissue sections revealed a high binding of [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) to the CB2-rich NHP spleen, which was significantly blocked by coincubation with the commercially available CB2 ligand, GW405833 (10 mu M). In contrast, no specific binding was observed by in vitro autoradiography with NHP brain sections, which was in agreement with the notion of a CB2-deficient healthy mammalian brain. In vitro findings were corroborated by PET imaging experiments in NHPs, where [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) uptake in the spleen was dose-dependently attenuated with 1 and 5 mg/kg GW405833, while no specific brain signal was observed. Remarkably, we observed tracer uptake and retention in the NHP spinal cord, which was reduced by GW405833 blockade, pointing toward a potential utility of [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) in probing CB2-expressing cells in the bone marrow. If these observations are substantiated in NHP models of enhanced leukocyte proliferation in the bone marrow, [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) may serve as a valuable marker for hematopoietic activity in various pathologies. In conclusion, [F-18]RoSMA-18-d(6) proved to be a suitable PET radioligand for imaging CB2 in NHPs, supporting its translation to humans.

[F-18]PF-06684511 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging BACE1. Despite favorable brain kinetic properties, the effective dose (ED) of [F-18]PF-06684511 estimated in non-human primates was relatively high. This study was therefore designed to evaluate the whole-body distribution, dosimetry, quantification, and test-retest reliability of imaging brain BACE1 with [F-18]PF-06684511 in healthy volunteers. Methods Five subjects were studied for the dosimetry study. Whole-body PET was performed for 366 min with 4 PET-CT sessions. Estimates of the absorbed radiation dose were calculated using the male adult model. Eight subjects participated in the test-retest study. Brain PET measurements were conducted for 123 min with an interval of 5 to 19 days between test and retest conditions. The total distribution volume (V-T) was estimated with one-tissue (1T), two-tissue (2T), compartment model (CM), and graphical analysis. Test-retest variability (TRV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ofV(T)were calculated as reliability measures. Results In the dosimetry study, the highest uptake was found in the liver (25.2 +/- 2.3 %ID at 0.5 h) and the largest dose was observed in the pancreas (92.9 +/- 52.2 mu Sv/MBq). The calculated ED was 24.7 +/- 0.8 mu Sv/MBq. In the test-retest study, 2TCM described the time-activity curves well.V-T(2TCM) was the highest in the anterior cingulate cortex (6.28 +/- 1.09 and 6.85 +/- 0.81) and the lowest in the cerebellum (4.23 +/- 0.88 and 4.20 +/- 0.75). Mean TRV and ICC ofV(T)(2TCM) were 16.5% (12.4-20.5%) and 0.496 (0.291-0.644). Conclusion The ED of [F-18]PF-06684511 was similar to other(18)F radioligands, allowing repeated PET measurements. 2TCM was the most appropriate quantification method. TRV ofV(T)was similar to other radioligands without a reference region, albeit with lower ICC. These data indicated that [F-18]PF-06684511 is a suitable radioligand to measure BACE1 level in the human brain.

Our objective was to introduce Y-90-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 to clinical application, providing additional avenues for personalized medicine. Here, we present our dosimetry estimate for Y-90-PSMA-617, report first clinical experiences, and discuss the advantages and drawbacks of varying the beta-emitter in PSMA-targeting radioligand therapy. Methods: To approximate radiation dosimetry, 4 patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer underwent serially performed imaging up to 1 wk after Lu-177-PSMA-617 therapy. Time-activity curves were extrapolated to the half-life of Y-90, and OLINDA was used to calculate the dosimetry estimate. In clinical practice, 11 patients with PSMA-positive lymph-nodal bulk disease were stratified to receive Y-90-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (mean, 3.2 GBq; range, 2.8-3.7 GBq); afterward, safety lab tests, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, and clinical findings were thoroughly followed. Results: The projected dosimetry for Y-90-PSMA-617 estimated a mean kidney dose of 3.47 +/- 1.40 Gy/GBq, red marrow dose of 0.11 +/- 0.04 Gy/GBq, and salivary gland dose of 5.57 +/- 1.34 Gy/GBq; randomly chosen metastases were approximated with 22.8 +/- 16.10 Gy/GBq. The observed acute hematologic toxicity (5 cases of leukopenia and 2 of thrombocytopenia, all grade 1 or 2) and clinical side effects (2 cases of transient xerostomia and 1 of nausea, all grade 1 or 2), as well as PSA response (any PSA response, 7/11 patients; >50% PSA decline, 5/11 patients), were comparable to Lu-177-PSMA-617 literature data. Conclusion: A factor 3-4 lower treatment activity for Y-90-PSMA-617 translates into a comparable dosimetry estimate and clinical findings similar to those of Lu-177-PSMA-617. However, safety was demonstrated only for patients with oligometastatic disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate its potential in patients with more disseminated bone involvement or visceral metastasis.

Oxycodone and morphine have distinctly different pharmacological profiles: Radioligand binding and behavioural studies in two rat models of neuropathic pain	PAIN			English	Article						oxycodone; morphine; kappa(2)-opioid receptors; chronic constriction injury (CCI); streptozolocin (STZ); painful diabetic neuropathy; radioligand binding	GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; CONTROLLED-RELEASE OXYCODONE; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTORS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; DARK AGOUTI RAT; NOR-BINALTORPHIMINE; DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; PERIPHERAL MONONEUROPATHY	Previously, we reported that oxycodone is a putative K-opioid agonist based on studies where intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) pre-treatment of rats with the K-selective opioid antagonist, nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI), abolished i.c.v. oxycodone but not morphine antinociception, whereas pretreatment with i.c.v. naloxonazine ([L-Selective antagonist) produced the opposite effects. In the present study, we used behavioural experiments in rat models of mechanical and biochemical nerve injury together with radioligand binding to further examine the pharmacology of oxycodone. Following chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in rats, the antinociceptive effects of intrathecal (i.t.) oxycodone, but not i.t. morphine, were abolished by nor-BNI. Marked differences were found in the antinociceptive properties of oxycodone and morphine in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats. While the antinociceptive efficacy of morphine was abolished at 12 and 24 weeks post-STZ administration, the antinociceptive efficacy of s.c. oxycodone was maintained over 24 weeks, albeit with an similar to 3- to 4-fold decrease in potency. In rat brain membranes irreversibly depleted of alpha- and delta-opioid binding sites, oxycodone displaced [H-3]bremazocine (kappa(2)-selective in depleted membranes) binding with relatively high affinity whereas the selective mu- and delta-opioid ligands, CTOP (D-Plie-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thi-NH2) and DPDPE [D-Pen(2,5)]-enkephalin), respectively, did not. In depleted brain membranes, the kappa(2b)-ligand, leu-enkephalin, prevented oxycodone's displacement of high-affinity [H-3]breinazocine binding, suggesting the notion that oxycodone is a kappa(2b)-Opioid ligand. Collectively, the present findings provide further support for the notion that oxycodone and morphine produce antinociception through distinctly different opioid receptor populations. Oxycodone appears to act as a kappa(2b)-opioid agonist with a relatively low affinity for p-opioid receptors. (c) 2007 International Association for the Study of Pain. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Furthermore, the novel radioligand [H-3](-)-trans-H-2-PAT was shown to label selectively H-1 receptors in guinea pig and rat brain with high affinity (K-D, similar to0.1 and 0.5 nM, respectively) and a B-max about 50 and 15%, respectively, of that observed for the H-1 antagonist radioligand [H-3]mepyramine. In the current study, [H-3](-)-trans-H-2-PAT-labeled cloned guinea pig and human H-1 receptors in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes with high affinity (K-D, similar to0.08 and 0.23 nM, respectively) and a B-max about 15% of that observed for [H-3]mepyramine. The binding of H-2-PAT to H-1 receptors in both CHO-H-1 cell lines was stereoselective with the (-)-trans-isomer having affinity (K-i, similar to1.5 nM) about 4-, 20-, and 50- times higher than the (-)-cis-, (+)-trans-, and (+)-cis-isomers, respectively; the affinity of (-)-trans-H-2-PAT was unaffected by excess GTP. In functional assays, (-)-trans-H-2-PAT was a full antagonist of histamine H-1-mediated stimulation of phospholipase C (PLC) and [H-3] inositol phosphates (IP) formation in CHO-H-1 cells, a full inverse agonist of constitutively active H-1 receptors in COS-7-H-1 cells, and a full competitive antagonist (pA(2) = 9.2) of histamine H-1-mediated contraction of guinea pig ileum. It is concluded that (-)-trans- H-2-PAT is an antagonist at H-1 receptors coupled to PLC/IP formation and smooth muscle contraction. Meanwhile, the observation that [H-3](-)-trans-H-2-PAT labels only a subpopulation of H-1 receptors and that (-)-trans-H-2-PAT activates H-1 receptors coupled to modulation of tyrosine hydroxylase suggests that there may be post-translational H-1 receptor heterogeneity.

The binding affinity of these compounds for human MT1 and MT2 receptors was determined using 2-[I-125]-iodomelatonin as the radioligand. The results of the SAR studies in this series led to the identification of compound 28, which exhibited better MT1 and MT2 receptor affinities than melatonin itself. This work also established the benzoxazole nucleus as a melatoninergic pharmacophore, which served as an isosteric replacement to the previously established alkoxyaryl core. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

A PDE10A PET ligand may provide evidence that a clinical drug candidate reaches and binds to the target. Here we describe the successful discovery and initial validation of the novel radiolabeled PDE10A ligand 5,8-dimethyl-2-[2-((1-C-11-methyl)-4-phenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-ethyl]-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyridine (C-11-Lu AE92686) and its tritiated analog H-3-Lu AE92686. Methods: Initial in vitro experiments suggested Lu AE92686 as a promising radioligand, and the corresponding tritiated and C-11-labeled compounds were synthesized. 3H-Lu AE92686 was evaluated as a ligand for in vivo occupancy studies in mice and rats, and C-11-Lu AE92686 was evaluated as a PET tracer candidate in cynomolgus monkeys and in humans. Results: C-11-Lu AE92686 displayed high specificity and selectivity for PDE10A-expressing regions in the brain of cynomolgus monkeys and humans. Similar results were found in rodents using 3H-Lu AE92686. The binding of C-11-Lu AE92686 and 3H-Lu AE92686 to striatum was completely and dose-dependently blocked by the structurally different PDE10A inhibitor 2-[4-(1-methyl-4-pyridin-4-yl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl)-phenoxymethyl]-quinoline (MP-10) in rodents and in monkeys. In all species, specific binding of the radioligand was seen in the striatum but not in the cerebellum, supporting the use of the cerebellum as a reference region. The binding potentials (BPND) of C-11-Lu AE92686 in the striatum of both cynomolgus monkeys and humans were evaluated by the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as the reference tissue, and BPND was found to be high and reproducible-that is, BP(ND)s were 6.5 +/- 0.3 (n = 3) and 7.5 +/- 1.0 (n = 12) in monkeys and humans, respectively. Conclusion: Rodent, monkey, and human tests of labeled Lu AE92686 suggest that C-11-Lu AE92686 has great potential as a human PET tracer for the PDE10A enzyme.

H-3 receptor antagonists such as 6-[(3-cyclobutyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepin-7-yl)oxy]-N-methyl-3-pyridinecarboxamide hydrochloride (GSK189254) can increase the release of these neurotransmitters and thus may offer potential therapeutic benefits in diseases characterized by disturbances of neurotransmission. The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate C-11-labeled GSK189254 (C-11-GSK189254) for imaging the histamine H-3 receptor in vivo by PET. Methods: GSK189254 exhibits high affinity (0.26 nM) and selectivity for the human histamine H-3 receptor. Autoradiography experiments were performed using H-3-GSK189254 to evaluate its in vitro binding in porcine brain tissues. GSK189254 was labeled by N-alkylation using C-11-methyl iodide in good yields, radiochemical purity, and specific activity. A series of PET experiments was conducted to investigate C-11-GSK189254 binding in the porcine brain. Results: In vitro autoradiography demonstrated specific H-3-GSK189254 binding in the porcine brain; therefore, C-11-GSK189254 was evaluated in vivo in pigs and showed good brain penetration and high uptake in regions such as the striatum and cortices, known to contain high densities of the histamine H-3 receptors. The radioligand kinetics were reversible, and quantitative analysis was achieved with a 2-tissue-compartmental model yielding the distribution volume as the outcome measure of interest. The distribution volume was reduced to a homogeneous level in all regions after blocking by the coadministration of either unlabeled GSK189254 or ciproxifan, a structurally distinct histamine H-3 antagonist. Further coadministration studies allowed for the estimation of the radioligand affinity (0.1 nM) and the density of histamine H-3 receptor sites in the cerebellum (0.74 nM), cortex (2.05 nM), and striatum (2.65 nM). Conclusion: These findings suggest that C-11-GSK189254 possesses appropriate characteristics for the in vivo imaging of the histamine H-3 receptor by PET.

(Magnoliaceae) is a plant of considerable medicinal significance; its flowers and seeds have been used in various traditional remedies. Radioligand binding assays of n-hexane seeds extract showed displacement of radioligand for cannabinoid (CB1 and CB2) and opioid delta (delta), kappa (kappa), and mu (mu) receptors. Bioactivity-guided fractionation afforded 4-O-methylhonokiol (1), magnolol (2), and honokiol (3), which showed higher binding to cannabinoid rather than opioid receptors in radioligand binding assays. Compounds 1-3, together with the dihydro analog of 2 (4), displayed selective affinity towards CB2R (K-i values of 0.29, 1.4, 1.94, and 0.99 mu M, respectively), compared to CB1R (K-i 3.85, 17.82, 14.55, and 19.08 mu M, respectively). An equal mixture of 2 and 3 (1:1 ratio) showed additive displacement activity towards the tested receptors compared to either 2 or 3 alone, which in turn provides an explanation for the strong displacement activity of the n-hexane extract. Due to the unavailability of an NMR or X-ray crystal structure of bound neolignans with the CB1 and CB2 receptors, a docking study was performed to predict ligand-protein interactions at a molecular level and to delineate structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the neolignan analogs with the CB1 and CB2 receptors. The putative binding modes of neolignans 1-3 and previously reported related analogs (4, 4a, 5, 5a, 6, 6a, and 6b) into the active site of the CB1 and CB2 receptors were assessed for the first time via molecular docking and binding free-energy ( increment G) calculations. The docking and increment G results revealed the importance of a hydroxyl moiety in the molecules that forms strong H-bonding with Ser383 and Ser285 within CB1R and CB2R, respectively. The impact of a shift from a hydroxyl to the methoxy group on experimental binding affinity to CB1R versus CB2R was explained through increment G data and the orientation of the alkyl chain within the CB1R. This comprehensive SAR, influenced by the computational study and the observed in vitro displacement binding affinities, has indicated the potential of magnolia neolignans for developing new CB agonists for potential use as analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, or anxiolytics.

Evaluation of σ-1 Receptor Radioligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-FTC-146 in Rats and Squirrel Monkeys Using PET	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						sigma-1 receptor; PET; F-18	IN-VIVO EVALUATION; CONSCIOUS MONKEY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; BINDING-SITES; PHARMACOLOGY; ANTAGONIST; BIOLOGY; LIGAND	The noninvasive imaging of sigma-1 receptors (S1Rs) could provide insight into their role in different diseases and lead to novel diagnostic/treatment strategies. The main objective of this study was to assess the S1R radiotracer F-18-FTC-146 in rats. Preliminary squirrel monkey imaging and human serum/liver microsome studies were performed to gain information about the potential of F-18-FTC-146 for eventual clinical translation. Methods: The distribution and stability of F-18-FTC-146 in rats were assessed via PET/CT, autoradiography, g counting, and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Preliminary PET/MRI of squirrel monkey brain was conducted along with HPLC assessment of F-18-FTC-146 stability in monkey plasma and human serum. Results: Biodistribution studies showed that F-18-FTC-146 accumulated in S1Rrich rat organs, including the lungs, pancreas, spleen, and brain. Pretreatment with known S1R compounds, haloperidol, or BD1047, before radioligand administration, significantly attenuated F-18-FTC-146 accumulation in all rat brain regions by approximately 85% (P < 0.001), suggesting radiotracer specificity for S1Rs. Similarly, PET/CT and autoradiography results demonstrated accumulation of (F-FTC)-F-18-146 in rat brain regions known to contain S1Rs and that this uptake could be blocked by BD1047 pretreatment. Ex vivo analysis of F-18-FTC-146 in the brain showed that only intact radiotracer was present at 15, 30, and 60 min, whereas rapid metabolism of residual F-18-FTC-146 was observed in rat plasma. Preliminary monkey PET/MRI studies demonstrated specific accumulation of F-18-FTC-146 in the brain (mainly in cortical structures, cerebellum, and vermis) that could be attenuated by pretreatment with haloperidol. HPLC of monkey plasma suggested radioligand metabolism, whereas F-18-FTC-146 appeared to be stable in human serum. Finally, liver microsome studies revealed that F-18-FTC-146 has a longer half-life in human microsomes, compared with rodents. Conclusion: Together, these results indicate that F-18-FTC-146 is a promising tool for visualizing S1Rs in preclinical studies and that it has potential for mapping these sites in the human brain.

Type-I luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) receptor (LHRH-R-I) is expressed not only in the pituitary, but also in several types of cancer disease. There are few data about LHRH-R-I expression in human BC. This study aimed to investigate the expression of LHRH and LHRH-R-I in the transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) type of human BC. RNA was extracted from 24 human bladder tumor specimens and three BC cell lines. RT-PCR was performed to detect mRNA for LHRH and LHRH-R-I. The protein of LHRH-R-I was further studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC), ligand competition assay, and Western Blot. PCR products of LHRH were found in 19 of 24 (79%) specimens and mRNA of LHRH-R-I was detected in 20 of 24 specimens (83%). Positive immunostaining for LHRH-R-I with different expression intensity was found in all samples examined, showing negative correlation with TCC grade. Radioligand binding studies also showed the presence of specific LHRH-R-I and high affinity binding of LHRH analogs. The high incidence of LHRH-R in BC suggests that it could serve as a molecular target for therapy of human BC with cytotoxic LHRH analogs or modern powerful antagonistic analogs of LHRH.

The precise neural and receptor basis of these effects have not been tested in man. Employing a combination of functional MRI (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), we investigated whether the effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta-9-THC), the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis, on anxiety and on amygdala response while processing fearful stimuli were related to local availability of its main central molecular target, cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors in man. Fourteen healthy males were studied with fMRI twice, one month apart, following an oral dose of either delta-9-THC (10 mg) or placebo, while they performed a fear-processing task. Baseline availability of the CB1 receptor was studied using PET with [C-11] MePPEP, a CB1 inverse agonist radioligand. Relative to the placebo condition, delta-9-THC induced anxiety and modulated right amygdala activation while processing fear. Both these effects were positively correlated with CB1 receptor availability in the right amygdala. These results suggest that the acute effects of cannabis on anxiety in males are mediated by the modulation of amygdalar function by delta-9-THC and the extent of these effects are related to local availability of CB1 receptors.

The serotonin hypothesis is, however, the model with most supporting data, although the details are only worked out to some extent. Recent clinical imaging measurements indeed imply a role in major depressive disorder (MDD) for the inhibitory serotonin autoreceptor 5-hydroxytryptamine(1B) (5-HT1B). The aim of the current study was to examine 5-HT1B receptor binding in the brain of MDD patients before and after psychotherapy. Ten patients with an ongoing untreated moderate depressive episode were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) and the 5-HT1B receptor selective radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369, before and after treatment with internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy. All of the patients examined responded to treatment, and 70% were in remission by the time of the second PET measurement. A statistically significant 33% reduction of binding potential (BPND) was found in the dorsal brain stem (DBS) after treatment. No other significant changes in BPND were found. The DBS contains the raphe nuclei, which regulate the serotonin system. This study gives support for the importance of serotonin and the 5-HT1B receptor in the biological response to psychological treatment of MDD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Biodistribution and dosimetry of <SUP>123</SUP>I-<i>m</i>ZIENT: a novel ligand for imaging serotonin transporters	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						I-123-mZIENT; Serotonin transporter; Brain; SPECT; Dosimetry	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY	Purpose I-123-labelled mZIENT (2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-((Z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane) has been developed as a radioligand for the serotonin transporter. The aim of this preliminary study was to assess its whole-body biodistribution in humans and estimate dosimetry. Methods Three healthy controls and three patients receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) therapy for depression were included (two men, four women, age range 41-56 years). Whole-body imaging, brain SPECT imaging and blood and urine sampling were performed. Whole-body images were analysed using regions of interest (ROIs), time-activity curves were derived using compartmental analysis and dosimetry estimated using OLINDA software. Brain ROI analysis was performed to obtain specific-to-nonspecific binding ratios in the midbrain, thalamus and striatum. Results Initial high uptake in the lungs decreased in later images. Lower uptake was seen in the brain, liver and intestines. Excretion was primarily through the urinary system. The effective dose was estimated to be of the order of 0.03 mSv/MBq. The organ receiving the highest absorbed dose was the lower large intestine wall. Uptake in the brain was consistent with the known SERT distribution with higher specific-to-nonspecific binding in the midbrain, thalamus and striatum in healthy controls compared with patients receiving SSRI therapy. Conclusion I-123-mZIENT may be a promising radioligand for imaging the serotonin transporters in humans with acceptable dosimetry.

In this study we have investigated its duration of action in vitro in an effort to characterise the receptor and tissue components involved. Chinese hamster ovary cell membrane fragments were used to determine the kinetics of azelastine at the H-1 receptor in a radioligand binding assay. Further duration of action studies were completed in tissue preparations using guinea-pig trachea and human bronchus. In radioligand binding studies, azelastine reached steady state at the H-1 receptor after approximately 41 min and exhibited a significantly slower dissociation rate constant from the receptor than the first generation antihistamine, diphenhydramine. In washout studies completed in guinea-pig and human airway in vitro tissue preparations, azelastine continued to antagonise the effects of histamine at the H-1 receptor for at least 18 h post-washout of the antagonist. This outcome was reversed following removal of the epithelium from guinea-pig isolated tracheal strips. These studies indicate there is a tissue component contributing to azelastine's duration of action, in addition to its direct H-1 receptor binding, with evidence suggesting a role for the epithelial layer.

Measuring Autoantibodies against IL-17F and IL-22 in Autoimmune Polyendocrine Syndrome Type I by Radioligand Binding Assay Using Fusion Proteins	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							CHRONIC MUCOCUTANEOUS CANDIDIASIS; ECTODERMAL DYSTROPHY; TH17-ASSOCIATED CYTOKINES; IMMUNOLOGICAL-TOLERANCE; ACID DECARBOXYLASE; GENE; EXPRESSION; CELLS; INTERLEUKIN-17; MUTATIONS	Autoantibodies against interleukin (IL)-17A, IL-17F and IL-22 have recently been described in patients with autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type I (APS I), and their presence is reported to be highly correlated with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC). The aim of this study was to develop a robust high-throughput radioligand binding assays (RLBA) measuring IL-17F and IL-22 antibodies, to compare them with current enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) of IL-17F and IL-22 and, moreover, to correlate the presence of these antibodies with the presence of CMC. Interleukins are small molecules, which makes them difficult to express in vitro. To overcome this problem, they were fused as dimers, which proved to increase the efficiency of expression. A total of five RLBAs were developed based on IL-17F and IL-22 monomers and homo- or heterodimers. Analysing the presence of these autoantibodies in 25 Norwegian APS I patients revealed that the different RLBAs detected anti-IL-17F and anti-IL-22 with high specificity, using both homo- and heterodimers. The RLBAs based on dimer proteins are highly reproducible with low inter-and intravariation and have the advantages of high throughput and easy standardization compared to ELISA, thus proving excellent choices for the screening of IL-17F and IL-22 autoantibodies.

Pretargeted PET of Osteodestructive Lesions in Dogs	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article; Early Access						positron emission tomography; in vivo pretargeting; tetrazine; trans-cyclooctene; bisphosphonate; copper-64; osteosarcoma; canines	IN-VIVO CHEMISTRY; TRANS-CYCLOOCTENE; CLICK CHEMISTRY; BISPHOSPHONATES; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; CANCER; STRATEGY; INSIGHTS	The last decade has witnessed the creation of a highly effective approach to in vivo pretargeting based on the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) click ligation between tetrazine (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO). Despite the steady progression of this technology toward the clinic, concerns have persisted regarding whether this in vivo chemistry will work in humans given their larger size and blood volume. In this work, we describe the use of a Cu-64-labeled Tz radioligand ([Cu-64]CuSarAr-Tz) and a TCO-bearing bisphosphonate (TCO-BP) for the pretargeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of osteodestructive lesions in a large animal model: companion dogs. First, in a small animal pilot study, healthy mice were injected with TCO-BP followed after 1 or 6 h by [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz. PET images were collected 1, 6, and 24 h after the administration of [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz, revealing that this approach produced high activity concentrations in the bone (>20 and >15%ID/g in the femur and humerus, respectively, at 24 h post injection) as well as high target-to-background contrast. Subsequently, companion dogs (n = 5) presenting with osteodestructive lesions were administered TCO-BP (5 or 10 mg/kg) followed 1 h later by [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz (2.2-7.3 mCi; 81.4-270.1 MBq). PET scans were collected for each dog 4 h after the administration of the radioligand, and SUV values for the osteodestructive lesions, healthy bones, and kidneys were determined. In these animals, pretargeted PET clearly delineated healthy bone and produced very high activity concentrations in osteodestructive lesions. Low levels of uptake were observed in all healthy organs except for the kidneys and bladder due to the renal excretion of excess radioligand. Ultimately, this work not only illustrates that pretargeted PET with TCO-BP and [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz is an effective tool for the visualization of osteodestructive lesions but also demonstrates for the first time that in vivo pretargeting based on IEDDA click chemistry is feasible in large animals.

We recently reported the preclinical evaluation of [Tc-99m]Tc-iFAP as a new SPECT radioligand capable of detecting FAP. This research aimed to evaluate the kinetic and dosimetric profile of [Tc-99m]-iFAP in healthy volunteers, and to assess the radioligand uptake by different solid tumors in three cancer patients. [Tc-99m]Tc-iFAP was obtained from lyophilized formulations prepared under GMP conditions with >98% radiochemical purity. Whole-body scans of six healthy subjects were obtained at 0.5, 2, 4, and 24 h after [Tc-99m]Tc-iFAP (740 MBq) administration. A 2D-planar/3D-SPECT hybrid activity quantitation method was used to fit the biokinetic models of the source organs (volume of interest: VOI) as exponential functions (A(t)(VOI)). The total nuclear transformations (N) that occurred in the source organs were calculated from the mathematical integration (0, infinity) of A(t)(VOI). The OLINDA code was used to estimate the radiation doses. Three treatment-naive patients (breast, lung, and cervical cancer) with a prior [F-18]FDG PET/CT scan underwent whole-body, chest, and abdominal SPECT/CT scanning after [Tc-99m]Tc-iFAP (740 MBq) administration. Both imaging methods were compared visually and quantitatively. Oncological diagnoses were performed histopathologically. The results showed favorable [Tc-99m]Tc-iFAP biodistribution and kinetics due to rapid blood activity removal (t(1/2)alpha = 2.22 min and t(1/2)beta = 90 min) and mainly renal clearance. The mean radiation equivalent doses were 5.2 +/- 0.8 mSv for the kidney and 1.7 +/- 0.3 mSv for the liver after administration of 740 MBq. The effective dose was 2.3 +/- 0.4 mSv/740 MBq. [Tc-99m]Tc-iFAP demonstrated high and reliable uptake in the primary tumor lesions and lymph node metastases in patients with breast, cervical, and lung cancer, which correlated with that detected by [F-18]FDG PET/CT. The tumor microenvironment molecular imaging from cancer patients obtained in this research validates the performance of additional clinical studies to determine the utility of [Tc-99m]Tc-iFAP in the diagnosis and prognosis of different types of solid tumors.

The goal of the present study was to evaluate the PDE2A ligand F-18-PF-05270430, 4-(3-fluoroazetidin-1-yl)-7-methyl-5-(1-methyl-5-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)imidazo[1,5-f][1,2,4]triazine, in nonhuman primates. Methods: F-18-PF-05270430 was radiolabeled by 2 methods via nucleophilic substitution of its tosylate precursor. Tissue metabolite analysis in rodents and PET imaging in nonhuman primates under baseline and blocking conditions were performed to determine the pharmacokinetic and binding characteristics of the new radioligand. Various kinetic modeling approaches were assessed to select the optimal method for analysis of imaging data. Results: F-18-PF-05270430 was synthesized in greater than 98% radiochemical purity and high specific activity. In the nonhuman primate brain, uptake of F-18-PF-05270430 was fast, with peak concentration (SUVs of 1.5-1.8 in rhesus monkeys) achieved within 7 min after injection. The rank order of uptake was striatum > neocortical regions > cerebellum. Regional time-activity curves were well fitted by the 2-tissue-compartment model and the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method to arrive at reliable estimates of regional distribution volume (V-T) and binding potential (BPND) with 120 min of scan data. Regional V-T values (MA1) ranged from 1.28 mL/cm(3) in the cerebellum to 3.71 mL/cm(3) in the putamen, with a BPND of 0.25 in the temporal cortex and 1.92 in the putamen. Regional BPND values estimated by the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) were similar to those from MA1. Test-retest variability in high-binding regions (striatum) was 4% +/- 6% for MA1 V-T, 13% +/- 6% for MA1 BPND, and 13% +/- 7% SRTM BPND, respectively. Pretreatment of animals with the PDE2A inhibitor PF-05180999 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of F-18-PF-05270430 specific binding, with a half maximal effective concentration of 69.4 ng/mL in plasma PF-05180999 concentration. Conclusion: F-18-PF-05270430 displayed fast and reversible kinetics in nonhuman primates, as well as specific binding blockable by a PDE2A inhibitor. This is the first PET tracer with desirable imaging properties and demonstrated ability to image and quantify PDE2A in vivo.

However, previous 5-HT1A receptor radioligands used in human imaging were antagonists, thought to bind to 5-HT1A receptors in different functional states (i.e., both the one which displays high affinity for agonists and is thought to mediate receptor activation, as well as the functional state which has low affinity for agonists). Comparing the PET imaging obtained using an agonist radioligand, which binds selectively to the functional state of the receptors, with the PET imaging obtained using an antagonist radioligand would therefore provide original information on 5-HT1A receptor impairment during AD. Methods: Quantitative autoradiography using F-18-F15599 and F-18-MPPF, a 5-HT1A agonist and antagonist, respectively, was measured in hippocampi of 18 patients with AD. Results: Functional 5-HT1A receptors, labeled by F-18-F15599, represented similar to 35% of total receptors, as estimated by F-18-MPPF labeling. F-18-F15599 binding decreased in dentate gyrus of patients with AD, as indicated by Braak's stages. In contrast, binding of F-18-MPPF was statistically unchanged. Conclusion: These in vitro results support testing the concept of functional PET imaging using agonist radioligands in clinical studies.

This compound was labeled with carbon-11 by niethylation of the S-desmethyl precursor 10 with [C-11]methyl iodide to obtain the potential positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]SMe-ADAM. The radiochenlical yield was 27 +/- 5%, and the specific radioactivity was 26-40 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis. Ex vivo and in vivo biodistribution experiments in rats demonstrated a rapid accumulation of the radiotracer in brain regions known to be rich in SERT, such as the thalamus/hypothalainus region (3.59 +/- 0.41%ID/g at 5 min after injection). The specific uptake reached a thalamus to cerebellum ratio of 6.74 +/- 0.95 at 60 min postinjection. The [C-11]SMe-ADAM uptake in the thalamus was significantly decreased by pretreatment with fluoxetine to 38 +/- 11% of the control value. Furthermore, no metabolites of [C-11]SMe-ADAM could be detected in the SERT-rich regions of the rat brain. It is concluded that [C-11]SMe-ADAM may be a suitable PET ligand for SERT imaging in the living brain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently an orphan receptor, SLC-1, has been identified as an MCH receptor (MCH-RI). Herein we identify and characterize a novel receptor for human MCH (MCH-R2). The receptor is composed of 340 amino acids encoded by a 1023-base pair cDNA and is 35% homologous to SLC-1. I-125-MCH specifically bound to Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing MCH-R2. MCH stimulated dose-dependent increases in intracellular free Ca2+ and inositol phosphate production in these cells but did not affect cAMP production. The pharmacological profile for mammalian MCH, [Phe(13),Tyr(19)]MCH, and salmon MCH at MCH-R2 differed compared with MCH-R1 as assessed by intracellular signaling and radioligand binding assays. The EC50 in signaling assays and the IC50 in radioligand binding assays of salmon MCH was an order of magnitude higher than mammalian MCH at MCH-R2. By comparison, the EC50 and IC50 values of salmon MCH and mammalian MCH at MCH-R1 were relatively similar. Blot hybridization revealed exclusive expression of MCH-R2 m-RNA in several distinct brain regions, particularly in the cortical area, suggesting the involvement of MCH-R2 in the central regulation of MCH-mediated functions.

Novel nicotinic action of the sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor	INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Insecticide; Sulfoxaflor; Myzus persicae (green peach aphid); Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Radioligand binding; Electrophysiology	TARGET-SITE RESISTANCE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; MYZUS-PERSICAE; AGONIST ACTIONS; BINDING; NEONICOTINOIDS; SAD-BETA-2	The novel sulfoximine insecticide sulfoxaflor is as potent or more effective than the neonicotinoids for toxicity to green peach aphids (GPA, Myzus persicae). The action of sulfoxaflor was characterized at insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) using electrophysiological and radioligand binding techniques. When tested for agonist properties on Drosophila melanogaster D alpha 2 nAChR subunit co-expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with the chicken beta 2 subunit, sulfoxaflor elicited very high amplitude (efficacy) currents. Sulfoximine analogs of sulfoxaflor were also agonists on D alpha 2/beta 2 nAChRs, but none produced maximal currents equivalent to sulfoxaflor nor were any as toxic to GPAs. Additionally, except for clothianidin, none of the neonicotinoids produced maximal currents as large as those produced by sulfoxaflor. These data suggest that the potent insecticidal activity of sulfoxaflor may be due to its very high efficacy at nAChRs. In contrast, sulfoxaflor displaced [H-3]imidacloprid (IMI) from GPA nAChR membrane preparations with weak affinity compared to most of the neonicotinoids examined. The nature of the interaction of sulfoxaflor with nAChRs apparently differs from that of IMI and other neonicotinoids, and when coupled with other known characteristics (novel chemical structure, lack of cross-resistance, and metabolic stability), indicate that sulfoxaflor represents a significant new insecticide option for the control of sap-feeding insects.

Alterations in dihydropyridine receptors in dystrophin-deficient cardiac muscle	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-HEART AND CIRCULATORY PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Duchenne muscular dystrophy; calcium channels; heart	DUCHENNE MUSCULAR-DYSTROPHY; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; MDX MOUSE; MYOCYTES; SKELETAL; BINDING; HEART; INACTIVATION; MEMBRANE; REGIONS	The deficiency of dystrophin, a critical membrane stabilizing protein, in the mdx mouse causes an elevation in intracellular calcium in myocytes. One mechanism that could elicit increases in intracellular calcium is enhanced influx via the L-type calcium channels. This study investigated the effects of the dihydropyridines BAY K 8644 and nifedipine and alterations in dihydropyridine receptors in dystrophin-deficient mdx hearts. A lower force of contraction and a reduced potency of extracellular calcium (P < 0.05) were evident in mdx left atria. The dihydropyridine agonist BAY K 8644 and antagonist nifedipine had 2.7- and 1.9-fold lower potencies in contracting left atria (P < 0.05). This corresponded with a 2.0-fold reduction in dihydropyridine receptor affinity evident from radioligand binding studies of mdx ventricular homogenates (P < 0.05). Increased ventricular dihydropyridine receptor protein was evident from both radioligand binding studies and Western blot analysis and was accompanied by increased mRNA levels (P < 0.05). Patch-clamp studies in isolated ventricular myocytes showed no change in L-type calcium current density but revealed delayed channel inactivation (P < 0.05). This study indicates that a deficiency of dystrophin leads to changes in dihydropyridine receptors and L-type calcium channel properties that may contribute to enhanced calcium influx. Increased influx is a potential mechanism for the calcium overload observed in dystrophin-deficient cardiac muscle.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether porcine and rat galanin radioligands could be used as probes to discriminate GAL receptors (GALR) subtypes using a cell line, RINm5F, that express multiple GALR subtypes. Data from parallel equilibrium binding experiments using the same RINm5F membrane homogenates reveal that [I-125]pGAL labels 20% more GALRs with a 2-fold lower affinity than those values identified when using [I-125]rGAL. Competition studies using various GAL peptides showed different rank order of potencies depending on the radioligand used. Preincubation of RINm5F membranes with GppNHp, a non-hydrolizable GTP analog, prior to radioligand labeling suggests that a portion of GALRs is precoupled to G proteins. In addition, receptors labeled by [I-125]rGAL appear more sensitive to GppNHp-induced uncoupling of G proteins than those labeled by [I-125]pGAL. In conclusion, our data suggest that pGAL and rGAL radioligands define different pharmacological profiles of GALRs, and hence, these ligands can be used as pharmacological tools to discriminate GALR subtypes. Additionally, our data suggests that GALRs exist in a precoupled state with their respective G-proteins prior to interaction with the agonist. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a GIPR-targeting positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand with receptor-specific binding, fast blood clearance, and low liver background uptake. The peptide DOTA-bioconjugate, C803-GIP, was developed based on the sequence of the endogenous GIP(1-30) and synthetic exendin-4 peptides with selective amino acid mutations to combine their specificity for the GIPR and in vivo stability, respectively. The Ga-68-labeled bioconjugate was evaluated in vitro in terms of binding affinity, specificity, and internalization in HEK293 cells transfected with the human GIPR, GLP1, or GCG receptors and in sections of human insulinoma and NENs. In vivo binding specificity, biodistribution, and tissue background were investigated in mice bearing huGIPR-HEK293 xenografts and in a pig. Ex vivo organ distribution, pharmacokinetics, and dosimetry were studied in normal rats. [Ga-68]Ga-C803-GIP was stable and demonstrated a high affinity to the huGIPR-HEK293 cells. Binding specificity was demonstrated in vitro in frozen sections of NENs and huGIPR-HEK293 cells. No specific uptake was observed in the negative controls of huGLP1R and huGCGR cells. A novel rationally designed PET radioligand, [Ga-68]Ga-C803-GIP, demonstrated promising binding characteristics and specificity towards the GIPR.

M4, the Outermost Helix, is Extensively Involved in Opening of the α4ß2 nACh Receptor	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Cys-loop receptor; M4 helix; mutagenesis; aromatic interaction; hydrophobic interaction	TRANSMEMBRANE ALPHA-HELIX; CYS-LOOP; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; AROMATIC RESIDUES; ACETYLCHOLINE; LIGAND; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; DOMAIN; CONTRIBUTES	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) are the archetypal members of the pentameric ligand-gated ion channel (pLGIC) family, an important class of cell signaling proteins. In all members of this family, each of the five subunits has four transmembrane a-helices (M1-M4), with M2 lining the pore, then M1 and M3, and with M4 outermost and adjacent to the membrane lipids. Despite its remote location, M4 contributes both to receptor assembly and gating in pLGICs where it has been examined. This study probes the role of M4 residues in the alpha 4 ss 2 nAChR using site-directed mutagenesis to individually mutate each residue to alanine, followed by expression in HEK293 cells and then characterization using membrane potential sensitive dye and radioligand binding. Two of the resulting mutant receptors showed altered EC(50)s, while 13 were nonfunctional, although coexpression with the chaperones RIC3 and nAChO resulted in 4 of these responding to agonist. Of the remaining 9, radioligand binding with epibatidine showed that 8 were expressed, suggesting these residues may play a role in channel opening. These data differ from similar studies in other pLGIC, where few or no Ala mutants in M4 ablate function, and they suggest that the alpha 4 ss 2 nAChR M4 may play a more significant role than in related receptors.

Nucleoside-5′-monophosphates as Prodrugs of Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> Receptor Agonists Activated by ecto-5′-Nucleotidase	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PLATELET-AGGREGATION INHIBITORS; PROSTATIC ACID-PHOSPHATASE; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; AFFINITY; BINDING; PHARMACOLOGY; INFLAMMATION; NUCLEOSIDE; MEMBRANES	Prodrugs of adenosine A(2A) receptor agonists were developed that are activated by ecto-5'-nucleotidase (ecto-5'-NT, CD73). Because ecto-5'-NT is upregulated in inflamed tissue, the A(2A) agonists are expected to be released from their prodrug form at the sites of inflammation. 2-(Ar)alkyl-substituted AMP derivatives were synthesized and investigated. Certain 2-substituted AMP derivatives, including 2-hexylthio-AMP, 2-cyclopentylthio-AMP, 2-cyclohexylmethylthio-AMP, and 2-cyclohexylethylthio-AMP were accepted as substrates by ecto-5'-NT and readily converted to the corresponding 2-substituted adenosine derivatives. The 2-cyclohexylethylthio substitution was a good compromise between the requirements of the ecto-5'-NT and the adenosine A(2A) receptor. The corresponding AMP derivative (12g) was a similarly good substrate as AMP itself, while the resulting adenosine derivative (11g) was a relatively potent A(2A) agonist (radioligand binding to rat brain striatal membranes: K-i = 372 nM; inhibition of anti-CD3/anti-CD28-induced IFN-gamma release in mouse CD4+ cells: EC50 = 50 nM). Compound 11g was released from 12g by incubation with CD4+ cells isolated from wild-type mice but only to a much smaller extent by cells from ecto-5'-NT knockout mice. Compound 12g will be a new lead structure for the development of more potent and selective ecto-5'-NT-activated prodrugs of selective anti-inflammatory A(2A) receptor agonists.

Ang II induced more potent contractions in the proximal part than in the distal part of isolated porcine basilar arteries. The contraction induced by Ang II was inhibited by the An II type 1 (AT(1)) receptor antagonist losartan, but the Ang II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor antagonist PD123319 enhanced it. After removal of the endothelium, the effect of losartan remained but the effect of PD123319 was abolished. The specific binding site of [H-3]Ang II on the smooth muscle membrane was inhibited by losartan, but not by PD123319. Stimulation of angiotensin II increased nitric oxide (NO) production in cultured basilar arterial endothelial cells. This production was inhibited by PD123319 and the NO synthase inhibitor L-N-G-nitroarginine. These results suggest that the contraction induced by Ang II might be mediated via the activation of AT(1) receptors on the basilar arterial smooth muscle cells and be modulated via the activation of AT(1) receptors on the endothelial cells, followed by NO production.

We have previously reported favorable activity with low toxicity in a prospective phase II trial involving 30 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We now report their longer-term outcomes, including a 20-patient extension cohort and outcomes of subsequent systemic treatments after completion of trial therapy. Methods: Fifty patients with PSMA-avid metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had progressed after standard therapies received up to 4 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA every 6 wk. Endpoints included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2), toxicity (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.03), imaging response, patient-reported health-related quality of life, progression-free survival, and overall survival. We also describe, as a novel finding, outcomes of men who subsequently progressed and had further systemic therapies, including Lu-177-PSMA. Results: Seventy-five men were screened to identify 50 patients eligible for treatment. Adverse prognostic features of the cohort included short median PSA doubling time (2.3 mo) and extensive prior treatment, including prior docetaxel (84%), cabazitaxel (48%), and abiraterone or enzalutamide (92%). The mean administered radioactivity was 7.5 GBq/cycle. A PSA decline of at least 50% was achieved in 32 of 50 patients (64%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 50%-77%), including 22 patients (44%; 95% CI, 30%-59%) with at least an 80% decrease. Of 27 patients with measurable soft-tissue disease, 15 (56%) achieved an objective response by RECIST 1.1. The most common toxicities attributed to Lu-177-PSMA were self-limiting G1-G2 dry mouth (66%), transient G1-G2 nausea (48%), G3-G4 thrombocytopenia (10%), and G3 anemia (10%). Brief Pain Inventory severity and interference scores decreased at all time points, including at the 3-mo follow-up, with a decrease of -1.2 (95% CI, -0.5 to -1.9; P = 0.001) and -1.0 (95% CI, -0.2 to -0.18; P = 0.013), respectively. At a median follow-up of 31.4 mo, median overall survival was 13.3 mo (95% CI, 10.5-18.7mo), with a significantly longer survival of 18.4 mo (95% CI, 13.8-23.8 mo) in patients achieving a PSA decline of at least 50%. At progression after prior response, further Lu-177-PSMA was administered to 15 (30%) patients (median of 2 cycles commencing 359 d from enrollment), with a PSA decline of at least 50% in 11 patients (73%). Four of 21 patients (19%) receiving other systemic therapies on progression experienced a PSA decline of at least 50%. There were no unexpected adverse events with Lu-177-PSMA retreatment. Conclusion: This expanded 50-patient cohort of men with extensive prior therapy confirms our earlier report of high response rates, low toxicity, and improved quality of life with Lu-177-PSMA radioligand therapy. On progression, rechallenge Lu-177-PSMA demonstrated higher response rates than other systemic therapies.

[C-11]PBR28 binding is commonly quantified using a two-tissue compartment model and an arterial input function. Previous studies with [C-11]-(R)-PK11195 demonstrated a slow irreversible binding component to the TSPO proteins localized in the endothelium of brain vessels, such as venous sinuses and arteries. However, the impact of this component on the quantification of [C-11]PBR28 data has never been investigated. In this work we propose a novel kinetic model for [C-11]PBR28. This model hypothesizes the existence of an additional irreversible component from the blood to the endothelium. The model was tested on a data set of 19 healthy subjects. A simulation was also performed to quantify the error generated by the standard two-tissue compartmental model when the presence of the irreversible component is not taken into account. Our results show that when the vascular component is included in the model the estimates that include the vascular component (2TCM-1K) are more than three-fold smaller, have a higher time stability and are better correlated to brain mRNA TSPO expression than those that do not include the model (2TCM).

Cloning and pharmacological characterization of the equine adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor:: a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of equine endotoxemia	JOURNAL OF VETERINARY PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; MEDIATED MECHANISMS; TISSUE PROTECTION; CELLS; METABOLITES; EXPRESSION; INHIBITOR	The aim of the current study was to clone the equine adenosine A(2A) receptor gene and to establish a heterologous expression system to ascertain its pharmacologic profile via radioligand binding and functional assays. An eA(2A)-R expression construct was generated by ligation of the eA(2A) cDNA into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector, and stably transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEK). Binding assays identified those clones expressing the eA(2A)-R, and equilibrium saturation isotherm experiments were utilized to determine dissociation constants (K-D), and receptor densities (B-max) of selected clones. Equilibrium competition binding revealed a rank order of agonist potency of ATL > CV-1808 > NECA > 2-CADO > CGS21680, and a rank order of antagonist potency as ZM241385 > 8-phenyltheophylline > p-sulfophenyltheophylline > caffeine. Furthermore, adenylate cyclase assays using selective A(2A)-R agonists revealed that the eA(2A)-R functionally coupled to G alpha(s) as indicated by an increase in intracellular [H-3]cAMP upon receptor activation. Finally, NF-kappa B reporter gene assays revealed a CGS21680 concentration-dependent inhibition of NF-kappa B activity. These results indicate that the heterologously expressed eA(2A)-R has a pharmacological profile similar to that of other mammalian A(2A) receptors and thus can be utilized for further characterization of the eA(2A)-R to ascertain whether it can serve as a suitable pharmacological target for equine inflammatory disease.

Transfection of ZFPs into cell lines can create expression systems where the targeted endogenous gene is transcribed and the protein of interest can be investigated in its own cellular context. Here we describe the pharmacological investigation of an expression system generated using CCK2 receptor-selective ZFPs transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (HEKZFP system). The receptors expressed in this system, in response to ZFP expression, were functional in calcium mobilization studies and the potency of the agonists investigated was consistent with their action at CCK2 receptors (CCK-8S pA(50) = 9.05 +/- 0.11, pentagastrin pA(50) = 9.11 +/- 0.13). In addition, binding studies were conducted using [I-125]-BH-CCK-8S as radioligand. The saturation binding analysis of this radioligand was consistent with a single population of high affinity CCK receptors (pK(D) = 10.24). Competition studies were also conducted using a number of previously well-characterized CCK-receptor selective ligands; J893182, YF476, PD-134,308, SR27897, dexloxiglumide, L-365,260 and L-364,718. Overall, the estimated affinity values for these ligands were consistent with their interaction at CCK2 receptors. Therefore, CCK2 receptors up-regulated using zinc finger protein technology can provide an alternative to standard transfection techniques for the pharmacological analysis of compounds.

Blockade and activation of this receptor with various antagonistic and agonistic analogues of native GnRE-I (pGlu(1)-HiS(2) -Trp(3)-Sef(4)-Tyr(5)-Gly(6) -Leu(7) -Arg(8)-Pro(9)-Gly(10)-NH2), respectively, has shown efficient suppression of tumor growth. In this study, the GnRH-receptor system has been evaluated with respect to its suitability as a target for in vivo peptide receptor targeting using radiolabeled GnRH-analogues, and in parallel, new F-18- and Ga-68-labeled GnRH analogues have been developed. In vitro radioligand binding assays performed with various GnRHR-expressing human cell lines using [I-125]Triptorelin (D-Trp(6)-GnRH-1) as the standard radioligand revealed a very low level of GnRH receptor expression on the cell surface. Generally, total cellular activity was very low (similar to 3% of the applied activity), and only a small fraction (max. 40%) of cell-associated activity could be attributed to receptor-specific radioligand binding/intemalization. However, substitution of fetal calf serum by NU serum in the culture medium led to increased and stable GnRHR-expression, especially in the ovarian cancer cell line EFO-27, thus allowing for a stable experimental setup for the evaluation of the new radiolabeled GnRH-I analogues. The new radiolabeled GnRH-I analogues developed in this study were all based on the D-Lys(6)-GnRH-I-scaffold. For Ga-68-labeling, the latter was coupled with DOTA at D-LyS(6). To allow F-18-labeling via chemoselective oxime formation, D-LyS(6)-GnRH-I was also conjugated with Ahx (ammohexanoic acid) or beta-Ala, which in turn was coupled with Boc-aminooxyacetic acid. F-18-labeling via oxime formation with 4-[F-18]fluorobenzaldehyde was performed using the Boc-protected precursors. Receptor affinities of [Ga-68]DOTA-GnRH-I, D-LyS(6)-AhX([F-18]FBOA)GnRH-I, and D-Lys(6) -beta Ala([F-18]FBOA)-GnRH-I (FBOA = fluorobenzyloxime acetyl) were determined using GnRHR-membrane preparations, and internalization efficiency of the new radioligands was determined in EFO-27 cells. Both quantities were highest for D-Lys(6)-Ahx([F-18]FBOA)-GnRH-1 (IC50 = 0.50 +/- 0.08 nM vs 0.13 +/- 0.08 nM for Triptorelin; internalization: 86 +/- 16% of the internal reference [I-125]Triptorelin), already substantially reduced in the case of the -fiAla([F-18]FBOA)-derivative (IC50 = 0.86 +/- 0.13 nM; internalization: 42 +/- 3% of [I-125]Triptorelin), while the [Ga-68]DOTA-analogue showed almost complete loss of binding affinity and ligand internalization (IC50 = 13.3 +/- 1.0 nM; internalization: 2.6 +/- 1.0% of [I-125]Triptorelin). Generally, the lipophilic residue [F-18]FBOA- is much better tolerated as a modification of the D-Lys(6)-side chain, with receptor affinity of the respective analogues strongly depending upon spacer length between the D-Lys(6)-side chain and the [F-18]FBOA-moiety. In summary, D-LyS6 (Ahx-[F-18]FBOA)-GnRH-1 shows the highest potential for efficient GnRHR-targeting in vivo of the compounds investigated. Unfortunately, however, the very low cell surface expression of GnRH-receptors and thusvery low radioligand uptake by GnRHR-positive tumor cells found in vitro was also confirmed by a preliminary biodistribution study in OVCAR-3 xenografted nude mice using the standard GnRHR radioligand [I-125]Triptorelin. Tumor uptake was lower than blood activity concentration at 1 h p.i. (0.49 +/- 0.05 vs 0.96 +/- 0.13 for tumor and blood, respectively). These data seriously challenge the suitability of the GnRHR-system as a suitable target for in vivo peptide receptor imaging using radiolabeled GnRH-I derivatives, despite the availability of high-affinity radiolabeled receptor-ligands such as D-Lys(6) (Ahx-[(8) F]FBOA)-GnRH-I.

We previously reported that an C-11-labeled aryloxyanilide (half-life, 20 min) was able to quantify TSPOs in the healthy human brain. Because many PET centers would benefit from a longer-lived F-18-labeled radioligand (half-life, 110 min), the objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of a closely related aryloxyanilide (F-18-N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline [F-18-PBR06]) to quantify TSPOs in the healthy human brain. Methods: A total of 9 human subjects were injected with F-18-PBR06 (similar to 185 MBq) and scanned for 5 h, with rest periods outside the camera. The concentrations of F-18-PBR06, separated from radiometabolites, were measured in arterial plasma. Results: Modeling of regional brain and plasma data showed that a 2-tissue-compartment model was superior to a 1-tissue-compartment model. Even if data for all time points were used for the fitting, concentrations of brain activity measured with PET were consistently greater than the modeled values at late (280-300 min) but not at early time points. The greater values may have been caused by the slow accumulation of radiometabolites in the brain. To determine an adequate time for more accurate measurement of distribution volume (V-T), which is the summation of receptor binding and nondisplaceable activity, we investigated which scan duration would be associated with maximal or near-maximal identifiability. We found that a scan of 120 min provided the best identifiability of V-T (similar to 2%). The images showed no significant defluorination. Conclusion: F-18-PBR06 can quantify TSPOs in the healthy human brain using 120 min of image acquisition and concurrent measurements of radioligand in plasma. Although brain activity is likely contaminated with radiometabolites, the percentage contamination is thought to be small (<10%), because values of distribution volume are stable during 60-120 min and vary by less than 10%. F-18-PBR06 is a longer-lived and promising alternative to C-11-labeled radioligands to measure TSPOs as a biomarker of inflammation in the brain.

Radioligand binding studies have revealed that certain beta-carbolines display high affinity for both I-1 and I-2 imidazoline-binding sites (IBS). Functional studies have shown that the beta-carboline harmane elicits many characteristics expected of an endogenous ligand IBS. This article discusses the evidence relating to beta-carbolines as endogenous ligands and presents a case for harmane and related compounds as endogenous ligands for IBS.

VISION Investigators	Lutetium-177-PSMA-617 for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; ADENOCARCINOMA; LU-177-PSMA; GUIDELINE; SURVIVAL; CRITERIA; TIME; PSMA	BACKGROUND Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer remains fatal despite recent advances. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is highly expressed in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-PSMA-617 is a radioligand therapy that delivers beta-particle radiation to PSMA-expressing cells and the surrounding microenvironment. METHODS We conducted an international, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating Lu-177-PSMA-617 in patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with at least one androgen-receptor-pathway inhibitor and one or two taxane regimens and who had PSMA-positive gallium-68 (Ga-68)-labeled PSMA-11 positron-emission tomographic-computed tomographic scans. Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Lu-177-PSMA-617 (7.4 GBq every 6 weeks for four to six cycles) plus protocol-permitted standard care or standard care alone. Protocol-permitted standard care excluded chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radium-223 (Ra-223), and investigational drugs. The alternate primary end points were imaging-based progression-free survival and overall survival, which were powered for hazard ratios of 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. Key secondary end points were objective response, disease control, and time to symptomatic skeletal events. Adverse events during treatment were those occurring no more than 30 days after the last dose and before subsequent anticancer treatment. RESULTS From June 2018 to mid-October 2019, a total of 831 of 1179 screened patients underwent randomization. The baseline characteristics of the patients were balanced between the groups. The median follow-up was 20.9 months. Lu-177-PSMA-617 plus standard care significantly prolonged, as compared with standard care, both imaging-based progression-free survival (median, 8.7 vs. 3.4 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.40; 99.2% confidence interval [CI], 0.29 to 0.57; P<0.001) and overall survival (median, 15.3 vs. 11.3 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.74; P<0.001). All the key secondary end points significantly favored Lu-177-PSMA-617. The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or above was higher with Lu-177-PSMA-617 than without (52.7% vs. 38.0%), but quality of life was not adversely affected. CONCLUSIONS Radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 prolonged imaging-based progression-free survival and overall survival when added to standard care in patients with advanced PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Imaging of cerebral α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub>* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with (-)-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]Flubatine PET: Implementation of bolus plus constant infusion and sensitivity to acetylcholine in human brain	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; IN-VIVO; BINDING; AVAILABILITY; RADIOLIGAND; SYSTEM; QUANTIFICATION; F-18-NIFENE; NONSMOKERS	The positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand (-)-[F-18] flubatine is specific to alpha(4)beta(2)* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and has promise for future investigation of the acetylcholine system in neuropathologies such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and substance use disorders. The two goals of this work were to develop a simplified method for alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChR quantification with bolus plus constant infusion (B/I) (-)-[F-18]flubatine administration, and to assess the radioligand's sensitivity to acetylcholine fluctuations in humans. Healthy human subjects were imaged following either bolus injection (n = 8) or B/I (n = 4) administration of (-)-[F-18]flubatine. The metabolite-corrected input function in arterial blood was measured. Freefraction corrected distribution volumes (V-T/f(P)) were estimated with modeling and graphical analysis techniques. Next, sensitivity to acetylcholine was assessed in two ways: 1.A bolus injection paradigm with two scans (n = 6), baseline (scan 1) and physostigmine challenge (scan 2; 1.5 mg over 60 min beginning 5 min prior to radiotracer injection); 2.A single scan B/I paradigm (n = 7) lasting up to 240 min with 1.5 mg physostigmine administered over 60 min beginning at 125 min of radiotracer infusion. Changes in V-T/f(P) were measured. Baseline V-T/f(P) values were 33.8 +/- 3.3 mL/cm(3) in thalamus, 12.9 +/- 1.6 mL/cm(3) in cerebellum, and ranged from 9.8 to 12.5 mL/cm(3) in other graymatter regions. The B/I paradigm with equilibrium analysis at 120 min yielded comparable V-T/f(P) values with compartment modeling analysis of bolus data in extrathalamic gray matter regions (regional means <4% different). Changes in V-T/f(P) following physostigmine administration were small and most pronounced in cortical regions, ranging from 0.8 to 4.6% in the two-scan paradigm and 2.8 to 6.5% with the B/I paradigm. These results demonstrate the use of B/I administration for accurate quantification of (-)-[F-18] flubatine V-T/f(P) in 120 min, and suggest possible sensitivity of (-)-[F-18] flubatine binding to physostigmine-induced changes in acetylcholine levels.

To study the biokinetics of C-11-KR31173 with a compartmental model, the input function is needed. Collection and analysis of arterial blood samples are the established approach to obtain the input function but they are not feasible in patients with renal diseases. The goal of this study was to develop a quantitative technique that can provide an accurate image-derived input function (ID-IF) to replace the conventional invasive arterial sampling and test the method in pigs with the goal of translation into human studies. Methods: The experimental animals were injected with [C-11]KR31173 and scanned up to 90 min with dynamic PET. Arterial blood samples were collected for the artery derived input function (AD-IF) and used as a gold standard for ID-IF. Before PET, magnetic resonance angiography of the kidneys was obtained to provide the anatomical information required for derivation of the recovery coefficients in the abdominal aorta, a requirement for partial volume correction of the ID-IF. Different image reconstruction methods, filtered back projection (FBP) and ordered subset expectation maximization (OS-EM), were investigated for the best trade-off between bias and variance of the ID-IF. The effects of kidney uptakes on the quantitative accuracy of ID-IF were also studied. Biological variables such as red blood cell binding and radioligand metabolism were also taken into consideration. A single blood sample was used for calibration in the later phase of the input function. Results: In the first 2 min after injection, the OS-EM based ID-IF was found to be biased, and the bias was found to be induced by the kidney uptake. No such bias was found with the FBP based image reconstruction method. However, the OS-EM based image reconstruction was found to reduce variance in the subsequent phase of the ID-IF. The combined use of FBP and OS-EM resulted in reduced bias and noise. After performing all the necessary corrections, the areas under the curves (AUCs) of the AD-IF were close to that of the AD-IF (average AUC ratio = 1 +/- 0.08) during the early phase. When applied in a two-tissue-compartmental kinetic model, the average difference between the estimated model parameters from ID-IF and AD-IF was 10% which was within the error of the estimation method. Conclusions: The bias of radioligand concentration in the aorta from the OS-EM image reconstruction is significantly affected by radioligand uptake in the adjacent kidney and cannot be neglected for quantitative evaluation. With careful calibrations and corrections, the ID-IF derived from quantitative dynamic PET images can be used as the input function of the compartmental model to quantify the renal kinetics of C-11-KR31173 in experimental animals and the authors intend to evaluate this method in future human studies.

The A<sub>2a</sub>R C-terminus provides improved total and active expression yields for adenosine receptor chimeras	AICHE JOURNAL			English	Article						chimera; adenosine A(1) receptor; GPCR trafficking	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; CARBOXYL-TERMINUS; MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; YEAST; PURIFICATION; A(1); CELL; CLASSIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE	Heterologous expression of many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a major bottleneck in drug discovery efforts for therapeutic development of the receptor. The goal of this study was to utilize domains from a well-trafficked GPCR to aid in improving the trafficking of a related receptor. The adenosine A(2a) receptor (A(2a)R) shows exceptional expression and trafficking to the plasma membrane in yeast; however, this is not the case for other adenosine receptors. A(2a)R has a longer C-terminus than the other adenosine receptors, which may contribute to its exceptional trafficking to the plasma membrane. To test the possibility to improve trafficking of the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R), chimeric receptors containing the seven transmembrane domains of A(1)R and the full-length or truncated A(2a)R C-terminus were constructed. The chimeric receptor showed improved localization to the plasma membrane and was capable of binding radioligand with native A(1)R affinity. Functionally active A(1)R receptor variants were produced at a theoretical yield of 95 pmol/mg total membrane protein, estimated using radioligand binding data, which are greater than three-fold higher than previously reported yields from other heterologous expression systems, and should facilitate biophysical characterization and drug discovery efforts.

Nonspecific binding was visually indistinguishable from autofluorescence in cells with intact cell membranes. Fluorescent labeling of cell perimeters, not present in control nontransfected cells, reversed in transfected cells upon washout of FNAL or following the addition of either unlabeled naloxone (25 mu M) or the mu specific antagonist CTOP (1 mu M). The addition of the delta and kappa specific agonists DPDPE (1 mu M) and U50 488 (1 mu M), respectively, failed to reverse the labeling. Further evidence of specific binding was obtained from kinetic experiments, where it was observed that only transfected cells showed a time-dependent exponential change in fluorescence that permitted estimation of association and dissociation binding rate constants of (5.8 +/- 0.5, mean +/- S.E.M.) x 10(5) M-1 s(-1) and (3.3 +/- 0.6) x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively and a kinetically derived dissociation constant of 5.7 +/- 1.4 nM. These estimates were comparable to those obtained under similar conditions in radioligand binding experiments using [H-3]-naloxone. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Radiolabeling was achieved in one-pot via acarbon-11 carbonylation reaction using [C-11]CO. The detailedregional brain distribution of [C-11]BIO-1819578 bindingwas evaluated using PET measurements in NHPs. Brain radioactivitywas measured for 93 min using a high-resolution PET system, and radiometaboliteswere measured in monkey plasma using gradient radio HPLC. Radiolabelingof [C-11]BIO-1819578 was successfully accomplished, andthe product was found to be stable at 1 h after formulation. [C-11]BIO-1819578 was characterized in the cynomolgus monkeybrain where a high brain uptake was found (7 SUV at 4 min). A pronouncedpretreatment effect was found, indicating specific binding to OGAenzyme. Radiolabeling of [C-11]BIO-1819578 with [C-11]CO was successfully accomplished. [C-11]BIO-1819578 bindsspecifically to OGA enzyme. The results suggest that [C-11]BIO-1819578 is a potential radioligand for imaging and for measuringtarget engagement of OGA in the human brain.

The target tracer [C-11] methyl (2-amino-5-(benzylthio) thiazolo[4,5-d] pyrimidin- 7-yl)-D-leucinate ([C-11] 5) was prepared from the acid precursor with [C-11] CH3OTf through O-[C-11] methylation and isolated by HPLC combined with SPE in 40-50% radiochemical yield, based on [C-11] CO2 and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB). The radiochemical purity was >99%, and the specific activity (SA) at EOB was 370-1110 GBq/mu mol with a total synthesis time of similar to 40-min from EOB. The radioligand depletion experiment of [C-11] 5 did not display specific binding to CX(3)CR1, and the competitive binding assay of ligand 5 found much lower CX(3)CR1 binding affinity.

Imaging endogenous opioid peptide release with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]carfentanil and [<SUP>3</SUP>H]diprenorphine: influence of agonist-induced internalization	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						[C-11]carfentanil; [H-3]diprenorphine; immunofluoresence; internalization; PET; mu receptor	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; GUANINE-NUCLEOTIDE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BRAIN; AMPHETAMINE; PAIN; RAT; METHADONE; SYSTEM	Understanding the cellular processes underpinning the changes in binding observed during positron emission tomography neurotransmitter release studies may aid translation of these methodologies to other neurotransmitter systems. We compared the sensitivities of opioid receptor radioligands, carfentanil, and diprenorphine, to amphetamine-induced endogenous opioid peptide (EOP) release and methadone administration in the rat. We also investigated whether agonist-induced internalization was involved in reductions in observed binding using subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy. After radioligand administration, Significant reductions in [C-11]carfentanil, but not [H-3]diprenorphine, uptake were observed after methadone and amphetamine pretreatment. Subcellular fractionation and in vitro radioligand binding studies showed that amphetamine pretreatment only decreased total [C-11]carfentanil binding. In vitro saturation binding studies conducted in buffers representative of the internalization pathway suggested that mu-receptors are significantly less able to bind the radioligands in endosomal compared with extracellular compartments. Finally, a significant increase in mu-receptor-early endosome co-localization in the hypothalamus was observed after amphetamine and methadone treatment using double-labeling confocal microscopy, with no changes in delta- or kappa-receptor co-localization. These data indicate carfentanil may be superior to diprenorphine when imaging EOP release in vivo, and that alterations in the ability to bind internalized receptors may be a predictor of ligand sensitivity to endogenous neurotransmitter release.

Benzovesamicol derivatives are proposed as radioligands for this purpose. We report QSAR studies of vesamicol and benzovesamicol derivatives taking into account the stereoselectivity of the VAChT binding site. Use of different data sets and different models in this study revealed that both enantiomers of 5-fluoro-3-(4-phenyl-piperidin-1-yl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-naphthalen-2-ol (5-FBVM) are promising candidates, with predicted VAChT affinities between 6.1 and 0.05 nM. The synthesis of enantiopure (R,R)- and (S,S)-5-FBVM and their corresponding triazene precursors for future radiofluorination is reported. Both enantiomers exhibited high in vitro affinity for VAChT [(+)-5-FBVM: K-i = 6.95 nM and (-)-5-FBVM: K-i = 3.68 nM] and were selective for sigma(2) receptors (similar to 70-fold), only (+)-5-FBVM is selective for sigma(1) receptors (similar to fivefold). These initial results suggest that (+)-(S, S)-5-FBVM warrants further investigation as a potential radioligand for in vivo PET imaging of cholinergic nerve terminals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Interaction of valerian extracts of different polarity with adenosine receptors:: identification of isovaltrate as an inverse agonist at A<sub>1</sub> receptors	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						valerian; adenosine receptors; bioassay-guided fractionation; isovaltrate; A(1) antagonist; inverse agonist	RAT CORTICAL-NEURONS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; MEDIATE INHIBITION; STRIATAL MEMBRANES; BRAIN; ADENOSINE-A1-RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGY; RADIOLIGAND; COMBINATION; ANTAGONISTS	A series of extracts of valerian roots (Valeriana officinalis L.) was prepared with solvents of different polarity. Polar as well as nonpolar extracts were found to interact with adenosine A, receptors. While polar extracts activated A, receptors (partial agonistic activity), nonpolar extracts showed antagonistic or inverse agonistic activity at A, receptors, as demonstrated by GTP gamma S binding assays at human recombinant A, receptors stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Guided by radioligand binding assays, fractionation of a lipophilic petroleum ether:diethyl ether (1:1) extract led to the isolation of isovaltrate, which was characterized as a potent, highly efficacious inverse agonist at adenosine A, receptors (K-i rat A(1): 2.05 mu M). In experiments at rat brain slices measuring post-synaptic potentials (PSPs) in cortical neurons, isovaltrate at least partly reversed the reduction in the PSPs induced by the adenosine A, receptor agonist N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA). Isovaltrate may serve as a new lead structure for the development of inverse agonists at adenosine A, receptors. The common use of hydrophilic, but not lipophilic valerian extracts as mild sleep-inducing agents is consistent with the opposite actions of hydrophilic and lipophilic extracts on adenosine receptors.

Sequence analysis revealed that rat and human cannabinoid CB2 receptors are divergent and share 81% amino acid homology. Pharmacological analysis of the possible species differences between rat and human cannabinoid CB2 receptors was performed using radioligand binding and functional assays. Pronounced species selectivity at the rat cannabinoid CB2 receptor (50- to 140-fold) was observed with AM-1710 (3-(1,1-Dimethyl-heptyl)-1-hydroxy-9-methoxy-benzo[c]chromen-6-one) and AM-1714 (3-(1,1-Dimethyl-heptyl)-1-9-dihydroxy-benzo[c]chromen-6-one). In contrast, JWH-015 ((2-Methyl-l-propyl-lH-indol-3-yl)-napthalen-1-yl-methanone) was 3- to 10-fold selective at the human cannabinoid CB2 receptor. Endocannabinoid ligands were more human receptor selective. Cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonist, AM-630 ((6-lodo-2-methyl-l-(2-morpholin-4-yl-ethyl)-1H-indol-3-yl)-(4-methoxy-phenyl)-methanone) was more potent at the rat receptor in radioligand binding and functional assays than that of the human receptor. The findings of the pharmacological differences between the human and rat cannabinoid CB2 receptors in this study provide critical information for characterizing cannabinoid ligands in in vivo rodent models for drug discovery purpose.

This compound is widely used as a ligand and bind specifically to the ER alpha. Radioligand binding assay is an in vitro method for drug development from natural products by synthesizing estradiol through radiolabeling using the radioiodination method. Synthesis of I-131-estradiol was perfomed by direct method using chloramine T as an oxidizer and by indirect labeling using I-131-histamine. The purity of chemical was determined by thin-layer chromatography and paper electrophoresis, as well as its stability for 30 days of storage in refrigerator, freezer and room temperature. The cellular uptake test of the radioligands from both methods was carried out with MCF7 and T-47D cell lines at 60 min. The results exhibited that I-131-estradiol was succesfully obtained with radiochemical purity greater than 95% and more stable in the refrigerator until 21 days than freezer and room temperature.

It has an X-linked recessive transmission, and is caused by mutations in the FOXP3 gene. We studied the intestinal morphological changes characterizing IPEX syndrome in a series of 12 children with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis. Histological examination of duodenal, gastric and colonic biopsies were retrospectively reviewed and compared by two independent experienced pathologists. In parallel, the presence of circulating anti-enterocyte antibodies was analysed using an indirect immunofluorescence technique and a quantitative radioligand assay against the 75-kDa autoantigen. The morphology of the inflammatory gut lesions could be categorized into three different entities, namely graft-vs-host disease-like changes (9/12 patients), a coeliac disease-like pattern (2/12) and an enteropathy with a complete depletion of goblet cells (1/12). Our results do not suggest any phenotype genotype correlation. Circulating antibodies were detected in all 12 patients, with an anti-brush border pattern (11/12) and anti-goblet cell antibodies (1/12), as well as by a radioligand assay. The histological presentation of autoimmune enteropathy is rather variable. However, a graft-vs-host disease-like pattern associated with positive anti-enterocyte antibodies is the most frequent intestinal presentation of IPEX syndrome, and constitutes a very valuable tool for pathologists to suspect this diagnosis.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor/phospholipase C pathway is increased in rat brain at the end of pregnancy	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						metabotropic glutamate receptor; phospholipase C; G(q/11) protein; pregnancy	BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ADENOSINE A(1) RECEPTOR; LOW TRYPTOPHAN DIET; AMINO-ACID; MESSENGER-RNA; PROLACTIN RESPONSES; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; DOWN-REGULATION	Wistar pregnant rats were sacrificed at the end of pregnancy and the status of metabotropic glutamate receptors/phospholipase C (mGluR/PLC) pathway was studied in brain from pregnant and non-pregnant female rats. Pregnancy causes a significant increase in metabotropic glutamate receptors number, determined by radioligand binding assay, without significant changes on receptor affinity. Similar increase in mGluR(1) type was obtained by immunoblotting assay using specific anti-mGluR(1) antibody. However, no significant differences were observed in mGluR(5) type, suggesting that the increase detected by radioligand assays could be due to mGluR(1) up-regulation. On the other hand, a significant increase in the alpha subunit of G(q) protein was also detected in pregnant rats by immunoblotting assays. Real-time PCR experiments revealed a significant increase in gene expression of metabotropic glutamate receptors and G(q) proteins. Neither protein level nor gene expression of phospholipase C beta(1) isoform was altered in pregnant rats. However, an increase in basal and agonist-stimulated phospholipase C activity was observed in membranes from pregnant rats. These results suggest that gestational period causes the up-regulation of both metabotropic glutamate receptors and coupled G(q)-protein and, in turn, an increase in phospholipase C activity.

This time, using 1a as a leading compound, we designed two novel iodinated analogues, N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-iodo-5-methoxybenzyl)acetamide (3a) and N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-iodo-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide (3b) for the PBR imaging. Ligands 3 were synthesized by the iodination of tributystannyl precursors 10. Radiolabeling for 3 with I-131 was carried out by the reaction of 10 with [I-131]NaI using H2O2 as an oxidizing agent. In vitro competition experiments determined that 3a exhibited both high affinity and selectivity for PBR (IC50: 7.8 nM) vs CBR (> 1 mu M). Biodistribution study in mice determined that [I-131]3a had a high radioactivity level (1.69% dose/g) in the brain, and its distribution pattern in the brain was consistent with the known distribution of PBR in rodents. Ex vivo autoradiography of the rat brain gave visual evidence that [I-131]3a was a potent and specific radioligand for PBR.

In the first series of experiments, rats were pretreated with vehicle, the 5-HT1A agonist 8-OH-DPAT or the 5-HT1A antagonist, WAY-100635 and exposed to 120 acoustic startle stimuli (95 dB) using a 30 s inter-trial interval. 8-OH-DPAT produced a dose-dependent increase in acoustic startle responding in CON and PS rats, with the PS rats exhibiting greater responding than CON rats. WAY-100635 depressed startle amplitudes only in the CON group. Finally, radioligand binding studies using [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT indicated a significant decrease in receptor density in hippocampal homogenates from PS rats but no difference in [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT binding from homogenates of the amygdala. Our results are consistent with earlier reports indicating that prenatal stress alters the serotonergic system. Specifically, our results indicate that gestational exposure to chronic mild stress enhances startle amplitudes following 8-OH-DPAT administration, prevents the depression in startle amplitudes following WAY-100635 administration and reduces [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT binding in hippocampal preparations.

These include nociception, feeding, cognition, locomotion, stress and neuroendocrine control. The endogenous receptor for this ligand is the nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptor. The distribution of NOP in rodent has been widely reported by the use of in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry and autoradiographic radioligand binding but less is known of its localization in higher species. We have therefore sought to optimize and determine the distribution of I-125[Tyr(14)]N/OFQ binding sites in macaque primate brain and spinal cord. Highest levels of binding were observed in neocortical areas, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus and putamen, medial thalamic nuclei and superficial laminae of the superior colliculus. These novel data present for the first time, the distribution of N/OFQ receptors in non-human primate CNS and, by comparison with localization in the rat, reveal that species differences may exist in the distribution of this neuropeptide receptor. These data have important implications regarding the roles of N/OFQ across species and may have ramifications in the interpretation of preclinical pharmacological studies. (C) 2003 IBRO.

Comparative Study of Carborane- and Phenyl-Modified Adenosine Derivatives as Ligands for the A2A and A3 Adenosine Receptors Based on a Rigid in Silico Docking and Radioligand Replacement Assay	MOLECULES			English	Article						in silico screening; adenosine; boron cluster; adenosine receptors; AR ligands	DRUG DISCOVERY; A(2A) RECEPTOR; A(3) RECEPTOR; BORON; PHARMACOPHORES; NUCLEOSIDES; AGONISTS; DESIGN; INFLAMMATION; ANTAGONISTS	Adenosine receptors are involved in many physiological processes and pathological conditions and are therefore attractive therapeutic targets. To identify new types of effective ligands for these receptors, a library of adenosine derivatives bearing a boron cluster or phenyl group in the same position was designed. The ligands were screened in silico to determine their calculated affinities for the A2A and A3 adenosine receptors. An virtual screening protocol based on the PatchDock web server was developed. In the first screening phase, the effects of the functional group (organic or inorganic modulator) on the adenosine ligand affinity for the receptors were determined. Then, the lead compounds were identified for each receptor in the second virtual screening phase. Two pairs of the most promising ligands, compounds 3 and 4, and two ligands with lower affinity scores (compounds 11 and 12, one with a boron cluster and one with a phenyl group) were synthesized and tested in a radioligand replacement assay for affinity to the A2A and A3 receptors. A reasonable correlation of in silico and biological assay results was observed. In addition, the effects of a phenyl group and boron cluster, which is new adenosine modifiers, on the adenosine ligand binding were compared.

Biodistribution in normal tissues is of interest for therapy planning. We evaluated if the biodistribution of Ga-68-PSMA-11 is influenced by tumor load. Results: In patients with high tumor load, SUVmean was reduced to 61.5% in the lacrimal glands, to 56.6% in the parotid glands, to 63.7% in the submandibular glands, to 61.3% in the sublingual glands and to 55.4% in the kidneys (p < 0.001). Further significant differences were observed for brain, mediastinum, liver, spleen and muscle. Total tracer retention was higher in patients with high tumor load (p < 0.05). SUV in lacrimal, salivary glands and kidneys correlated negatively with PSA. Materials and Methods: 135 patients were retrospectively evaluated. SUV was measured in the lacrimal and salivary glands, brain, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, muscle and bone. SUV was correlated with visual tumor load, total tracer retention and PSA. Conclusions: Patients with high tumor load show a significant reduction of tracer uptake in dose-limiting organs. As similar effects might occur when performing RLT using Lu-177-labeled PSMA-ligands, individual adaptations of therapy protocols based on diagnostic PSMA PET imaging before therapy might help to further increase efficacy and safety of RLT.

In prior studies, we established an expression system for A2a-GFP. Here, we quantified the total A2a-GFP expression levels by correlating GFP levels as detected by fluorescence and densitometry to A2a-GFP molecules overexpressed in the system. We also quantified A2a-GFP functional levels by classical radioligand binding assays. Approximately, 120,000 functional A2a-GFP molecules per cell were present on the plasma membrane as determined by radioligand binding. Using whole cell GFP fluorescence, 340,000 A2a-GFP molecules per cell were detected; approximately 70% of those molecules were plasma membrane localized, as determined by using confocal microscopy analysis. These results show that a significant portion of the total expressed protein is functional. In addition, the quick and inexpensive whole cell fluorescence appears to provide a good approximation of functional receptor numbers for this case. Importantly, the amount of functionally expressed A2a-GFP per culture (similar to 4 mg/L) is among the highest reported for any GPCR in any expression system. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We aimed to determine overall survival (OS) in patients experiencing sustained PSA increase, decrease, or fluctuations during therapy. Materials and methods In this bicentric study, we included 176 mCRPC patients treated with PSMA-directed RLT. PSA levels were determined using blood samples prior to the first RLT and on the admission days for the following cycles. We calculated relative changes in PSA levels compared to baseline. Kaplan-Meier curves as well as log-rank test were used to compare OS of different subgroups, including patients with sustained PSA increase, decrease, or fluctuations (defined as change after initial decrease or increase after the first cycle). Results Sixty-one out of one hundred seventy-six (34.7%) patients showed a sustained increase and 86/176 (48.8%) a sustained decrease in PSA levels. PSA fluctuations were observed in the remaining 29/176 (16.5%). In this subgroup, 22/29 experienced initial PSA decrease followed by an increase (7/29, initial increase followed by a decrease). Median OS of patients with sustained decrease in PSA levels was significantly longer when compared to patients with sustained increase of PSA levels (19 vs. 8 months; HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.22-0.56; P < 0.001). Patients with PSA fluctuations showed a significantly longer median OS compared to patients with sustained increase of PSA levels (18 vs. 8 months; HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.30-0.80; P < 0.01), but no significant difference relative to men with sustained PSA decrease (18 vs. 19 months; HR 1.4, 95% CI 0.78-2.49; P = 0.20). In addition, in men experiencing PSA fluctuations, median OS did not differ significantly between patients with initial decrease or initial increase of tumor marker levels (16 vs. 18 months; HR 1.2, 95% CI 0.38-4.05; P = 0.68). Conclusion Initial increase or decrease of PSA levels is sustained in the majority of patients undergoing RLT. Sustained PSA decrease was linked to prolonged survival and men with PSA fluctuations under treatment experienced comparable survival benefits. As such, transient tumor marker oscillations under RLT should rather not lead to treatment discontinuation, especially in the absence of radiological progression.

In this study, we identified CB2 antagonists using a three-step "deep learning-pharmacophore-molecular docking " virtual screening approach. From the ChemDiv database (1,178,506 compounds), 15 hits were selected and tested by radioligand binding assays and cAMP functional assays. A total of 7 out of the 15 hits were found to exhibit binding affinities in the radioligand binding assays against CB2 receptor, with a pK(i) of 5.15-6.66, among which five compounds showed antagonistic activities with pIC(50) of 5.25-6.93 in the cAMP functional assays. Among these hits, Compound 8 with the 4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one scaffold showed the best binding affinity and antagonistic activity with a pK(i) of 6.66 and pIC(50) of 6.93, respectively. The new scaffold could serve as a lead for further development of CB2 drugs. Additionally, we hope that the model in this study could be further utilized to identify more novel CB2 receptor antagonists, and the developed approach could also be used to design potent ligands for other therapeutic targets.

Compound 7a was docked into a homology model of the A(2B) receptor based on X-ray structures of the related A(2A) receptor, and its interactions with the adenosine binding site were rationalized. Binding affinity data were determined at the four human adenosine receptor subtypes. Despite a rather low selectivity regarding the A(l) receptor, 7a was radiolabeled as the most suitable candidate (K-i(A(2B)) = 4.24 nM) in order to perform in vivo studies in mice with the aim to estimate fundamental pharmacokinetic characteristics of the compound class. Organ distribution studies and a single PET study demonstrated brain uptake of [F-18] 7a with a standardized uptake value (SUV) of approximate to 1 at 5 min post injection followed by a fast wash out. Metabolism studies of [F-18] 7a in mice revealed the formation of a blood-brain barrier penetrable radiometabolite, which could be structurally identified. The results of this study provide an important basis for the design of new derivatives with improved binding properties and metabolic stability in vivo.

Cerebral serotonin release correlates with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]AZ10419369 PET measures of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor binding in the pig brain	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; serotonin; brain imaging; kinetic modelling; neurosurgery	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; IN-VIVO BINDING; CONSCIOUS MONKEYS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; PRIMATE BRAIN; MICRODIALYSIS; FENFLURAMINE; CITALOPRAM; RADIOLIGAND	Positron emission tomography (PET) can, when used with appropriate radioligands, non-invasively capture temporal and spatial information about acute changes in brain neurotransmitter systems. We here evaluate the 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist PET radioligand, [C-11]AZ10419369, for its sensitivity to detect changes in endogenous cerebral serotonin levels, as induced by different pharmacological challenges. To enable a direct translation of PET imaging data to changes in brain serotonin levels, we compared the [C-11]AZ10419369 PET signal in the pig brain to simultaneous measurements of extracellular serotonin levels with microdialysis after various acute interventions (saline, escitalopram, fenfluramine). The interventions increased the cerebral extracellular serotonin levels to two to six times baseline, with fenfluramine being the most potent pharmacological enhancer of serotonin release. The interventions induced a varying degree of decline in [C-11]AZ10419369 binding in the brain, consistent with the occupancy competition model. The observed correlation between changes in the extracellular serotonin level in the pig brain and the 5-HT1B receptor occupancy indicates that [C-11]AZ10419369 binding is sensitive to changes in endogenous serotonin levels to a degree equivalent to that reported of [C-11]raclopride to dopamine, a much used approach to detect in vivo change in cerebral dopamine.

PLR was evaluated using pupillometry in 35 patients with PD without clinical evidence of autonomic dysfunction and 44 healthy matched controls. PLR was elicited using a fully automated pupillometry system and six parameters were measured. Dopamine transporter imaging was performed using radioactive ioflupane I-123-FP-CIT [I-123-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane]. A significant increase in latency and a significant decrease in amplitude, maximum constriction velocity, as well as maximum acceleration were observed in PD patients. There was no significant difference in initial radius and minimum radius values. Investigating the relationship between pupillometry parameters and I-123-FP-CIT binding values, we correlated values from the semiquantitative analysis of radioligand uptake with pupillometry parameters, but we found no significant correlation. This study demonstrates PLR impairment in patients with PD without overt autonomic dysfunction. This impairment does not seem to correspond to the reduction of radioligand binding in the striatum as the result of presynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction, suggesting a different deterioration rate of these systems.

A reliable automated process for routine production of the carbon-11 labelled analogue [C-11]PR04.MZ ([C-11]-1) has been developed using GMP compliant equipment. An adult female Papio anubis baboon was studied using a test-retest protocol with [C-11]-1 in order to assess test-retest reliability, metabolism and CNS distribution profile of the tracer in non-human primates. Blood sampling was performed throughout the studies for determination of the free fraction in plasma (f(P)), plasma input functions and metabolic degradation of the radiotracer [C-11]-1. Time-activity curves were derived for the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the ventral striatum, the midbrain and the cerebellum. Distribution volumes (V-T) and non-displaceable binding potentials (BPND) for various brain regions and the blood were obtained from kinetic modelling. [C-11]-1 shows promising results as a selective marker of the presynaptic dopamine transporter. With the reliable visualisation of the extra-striatal dopaminergic neurons and no indication on labelled metabolites, the tracer provides excellent potential for translation into man.

J	Sanchez-Crespo, A; Jussing, E; Björklund, AC; Tamm, KP				Sanchez-Crespo, Alejandro; Jussing, Emma; Bjorklund, Ann-Charlotte; Tamm, Katja Pokrovskaja			Hallmarks in prostate cancer imaging with Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT with reference to detection limits and quantitative properties	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Prostate cancer; PSMA; PET; Detection limits; Image quantification	TUMOR VOLUME; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; ANTIGEN; TISSUE; PET/CT; CELLS; PSA	Background: Gallium-68-labeled prostate-specific antigen positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging (Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT) has emerged as a potential gold standard for prostate cancer (PCa) diagnosis. However, the imaging limitations of this technique at the early state of PCa recurrence/metastatic spread are still not well characterized. The aim of this study was to determine the quantitative properties and the fundamental imaging limits of Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT in localizing small PCa cell deposits. Methods: The human PCa LNCaP cells (PSMA expressing) were grown and collected as single cell suspension or as 3D-spheroids at different cell numbers and incubated with Ga68-PSMA-11. Thereafter, human HCT116 cells (PSMA negative) were added to a total cell number of 2 x 10(5) cells per tube. The tubes were then pelleted and the supernatant aspirated. A whole-body PET/CT scanner with a clinical routine protocol was used for imaging the pellets inside of a cylindrical water phantom with increasing amounts of background activity. The actual activity bound to the cells was also measured in an automatic gamma counter. Imaging detection limits and activity recovery coefficients as a function of LNCaP cell number were obtained. The effect of Ga68-PSMA-11 mass concentration on cell binding was also investigated in samples of LnCaP cells incubated with increasing concentrations of radioligand. Results: A total of 1 x 10(4) LNCaP cells mixed in a pellet of 2 x 10(5) cells were required to reach a 50% detection probability with Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT without background. With a background level of 1 kBq/ml, between 4 x 10(5) and 1 x 10(6) cells are required. The radioligand equilibrium dissociation constant was 27.05 nM, indicating high binding affinity. Hence, the specific activity of the radioligand has a profound effect on image quantification. Conclusions: Ga68-PSMA-11-PET detects a small number of LNCaP cells even when they are mixed in a population of non-PSMA expressing cells and in the presence of background. The obtained image detection limits and characteristic quantification properties of Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT are essential hallmarks for the individualization of patient management. The use of the standardized uptake value for Ga68-PSMA-11-PET/CT image quantification should be precluded.

RESULTSComparative radioligand binding studies using membranes of Myzus persicae (Sulzer) and representatives of the chloropyridyl subclass (imidacloprid), the chlorothiazolyl subclass (thiamethoxam), the tetrahydrofuranyl subclass (dinotefuran), as well as the novel sulfoximine type (sulfoxaflor), which is not a neonicotinoid, reveal significant differences in the number of binding sites, the displacing potencies and the mode of binding interference. Furthermore, the mode of interaction of [H-3]thiamethoxam and the nicotinic antagonists methyllycaconitine and dihydro--erythroidine is unique, with Hill values of >1, clearly different to the values of around unity for [H-3]imidacloprid and [H-3]N-desmethylthiamethoxam. The interaction of [H-3]N-desmethylthiamethoxam with the agonist (-)nicotine is also characterised by a Hill value of >1. CONCLUSIONSThere is no single conserved site or mode of binding of neonicotinoids and related nicotinic ligands to their target receptor, but a variety of binding pockets depending on the combination of receptor subunits, the receptor subtype, its functional state, as well as the structural flexibility of both the binding pockets and the ligands.

Moreover, the acute adverse-effect profile of the active compounds (1a-7a, 12a) with respect to impairment of motor performance was evaluated in the chimney test. Among 4-alkyl-5-(3-chlorobenzyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones, ethyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, and heptyl derivatives administered intraperitoneally in a dose of 300 mg/kg protected 100% of the tested animals at four pretreatment times (i.e., 15, 30, 60, 120 mm). Taking into account the median effective and toxic doses as well as the time-course profile of anticonvulsant activity, 5-(3-chlorobenzyl)-4-hexyl-2,4-dihydro-3H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione (4a) was proposed as the best tolerated and the most promising potential drug candidate. Finally, a radioligand binding assay was used to check whether the anticonvulsant activity of 4-alkyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones was a result of their interactions (direct or allosteric) with GABA(A) receptor complex and/or their affinity to benzodiazepine (BDZ) binding sites.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; SUBSTANCE-P; ANTAGONISTS; TENDON; INTERNALIZATION; EXPRESSION; MEDIATORS; EXERCISE; DISEASES; MUSCLE	In response to pain, neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptor availability is altered in the central nervous system. The NK1 receptor and its primary agonist, substance P, also play a crucial role in peripheral tissue in response to pain, as part of neurogenic inflammation. However, little is known about alterations in NK1 receptor availability in peripheral tissue in chronic pain conditions and very few studies have been performed on human beings. Ten subjects with chronic tennis elbow were therefore examined by positron emission tomography (PET) with the NK1 specific radioligand [C-11]GR205171 before and after treatment with graded exercise. The radioligand signal intensity was higher in the affected arm as compared with the unaffected arm, measured as differences between the arms in volume of voxels and signal intensity of this volume above a reference threshold set as 2.5 SD above mean signal intensity of the unaffected arm before treatment. In the eight subjects examined after treatment, pain ratings decreased in all subjects but signal intensity decreased in five and increased in three. In conclusion, NK1 receptors may be activated, or up-regulated in the peripheral, painful tissue of a chronic pain condition. This up-regulation does, however, have moderate correlation to pain ratings. The increased NK1 receptor availability is interpreted as part of ongoing neurogenic inflammation and may have correlation to the pathogenesis of chronic tennis elbow.

Development of LC-MS/MS-Based Receptor Occupancy Tracers and Positron Emission Tomography Radioligands for the Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ (NOP) Receptor	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; BINDING-SITES; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; VIVO EVALUATION; IMAGING AGENT; DOPAMINE D2; ORPHANIN-FQ; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONIST	Currently, a lack of sufficient tools has limited the understanding of the relationship between neuropsychiatric disorders and the nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) receptor. Herein, we describe the discovery and development of an antagonist NOP receptor occupancy (RO) tracer and a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand suitable to probe the NOP receptor in human clinical studies. A thorough structure activity relationship (SAR) around the high-affinity 3-(2'-fluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-halobenzyl)-N-alkylpropanamide scaffold identified a series of sub-nanomolar, highly selective NOP antagonists. Subsequently, these unlabeled NOP ligands were evaluated in vivo by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in rat to determine brain uptake, kinetics and specific binding. (S)-27 was identified as a suitable unlabeled preclinical RO tracer to accurately quantify NOP receptor engagement in rat brain. Three compounds were selected for evaluation in nonhuman primates as PET tracers: (-)-26, (-)-30, and (-)-33. Carbon-11 labeling of (+)-31 yielded [C-11]-(S)-30, which exhibited minimal generation of central nervous system (CNS) penetrant radiometabolites, improved brain uptake, and was an excellent PET radioligand in both rat and monkey. Currently [C-11]-(S)-30 is being evaluated as a PET radiotracer for the NOP receptor in human subjects.

The pharmacological effects of 6-MKG were tested on isolated non-pregnant or late-pregnant rat uteri in vitro, whilst docking studies were carried out modelling of the binding of 6-MKG to the rat beta(2)-adrenoceptor in silico. In vitro studies revealed that 6-MKG was able to relax both the non-pregnant and the late-pregnant uterine contractility with 50% of the E-max of terbutaline, whilst the EC50 for 6-MKG was at least half than that of terbutaline. The beta(2)-adrenoceptors antagonist 3-(isopropylamino)-1-[(7-methyl-4-indanyl)oxy]butan-2-ol (ICl118,551) competitively antagonised the relaxing effect of 6-MKG. Radioligand binding and cAMP studies confirmed the beta(2)-adrenoceptors agonistic property of the compound. In in silico docking studies, 6-MKG bound to rat beta(2)-adrenoceptors with low Delta G(bind) value (-11.53 +/- 0.06 kcal/mol) and it interacted with four residues of the active site (Asp(113), Asn(312), Cys(191)and Tyr(316)). It is concluded that 6-MKG exerts weak beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonistic activity and can be considered a natural compound with potential therapeutic significance in the field of premature pregnant uterine contractions and asthmatic problems.

Synthesis and Investigation of a Radioiodinated F3 Peptide Analog as a SPECT Tumor Imaging Radioligand	PLOS ONE			English	Article							ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; IN-VIVO; SURFACE; GROWTH; NUCLEOLIN; PROTEINS; NANOPARTICLES; ANGIOGENESIS; REAGENTS; NUCLEUS	A radioiodinated derivative of the tumor-homing F3 peptide, (N-(2-{3-[I-125]Iodobenzoyl} aminoethyl) maleimide-F3Cys peptide, [I-125]IBMF3 was developed for investigation as a SPECT tumor imaging radioligand. For this purpose, we custom synthesized a modified F3 peptide analog (F3Cys) incorporating a C-terminal cysteine residue for site-specific attachment of a radioiodinated maleimide conjugating group. Initial proof-of-concept Fluorescence studies conducted with AlexaFluor 532 C-5 maleimide-labeled F3Cys showed distinct membrane and nuclear localization of F3Cys in MDA-MB-435 cells. Additionally, F3Cys conjugated with NIR fluorochrome AlexaFluor 647 C-2 maleimide demonstrated high tumor specific uptake in melanoma cancer MDA-MB-435 and lung cancer A549 xenografts in nude mice whereas a similarly labeled control peptide did not show any tumor uptake. These results were also confirmed by ex vivo tissue analysis. No-carrier-added [I-125]IBMF3 was synthesized by a radioiododestannylation approach in 73% overall radiochemical yield. In vitro cell uptake studies conducted with [I-125]IBMF3 displayed a 5-fold increase in its cell uptake at 4 h when compared to controls. SPECT imaging studies with [I-125]IBMF3 in tumor bearing nude mice showed clear visualization of MDA-MB-435 xenografts on systemic administration. These studies demonstrate a potential utility of F3 peptide-based radioligands for tumor imaging with PET or SPECT techniques.

For this purpose, BODIPY dye is very attractive because one of its fluorine atoms can be readily exchanged with F-18, and it can be modified to produce red shifted fluorescence. In this study, therefore, we synthesized and investigated a F-18-labeled red-shifted BODIPY dye as a prosthetic group for brain hybrid PET/optical imaging agents and determined the optimal dose of this radioligand for hybrid imaging. The red-shifted BODIPY dye (1) was synthesized, and one of its fluorine atoms was exchanged with '8F using SnCl (4) in high yield. Partition coefficients of BF-labeled BODIPY dye ([F-18]1) and 1 were measured using its radioactivity and fluorescence, respectively, which were shown to be suitable for brain penetration. Optimal dose for hybrid imaging was determined by analysis of PET/CT and optical images of Balb/C nude mice injected with [F-18]1 and 1, respectively. Hybrid PET/optical images of mice injected with optimal dose of [F-18]1 showed strong radioactivity and fluorescence signal in the brain at 2 min after injection, with rapid clearance by 30 min. Tissue distribution data confirmed the in vivo and ex vivo PET/optical imaging data, indicating desirable brain pharmacokinetics of the radioligand. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that [F-18]1 can be widely used as a prosthetic group for brain hybrid PET/optical imaging agents.

We also compared our results with the wild-type AT(1) receptor and investigated the possible reasons behind that. Both wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells and the binding affinities of the antagonists were determined by radioligand binding assay. Inhibition of agonist-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation by the antagonists was also done. Substitution of asparagine(235) of intracellular loop 3 of the AT(1) receptor by arginine increased the binding affinity of the antagonists 5 - 34-fold, whereas the increase in the binding affinity of the antagonists in the phenylalanine(239) mutant by arginine and tryptophan (F239R and F239W) were 3 - 19-fold and 2 - 15-fold higher, respectively, compared to the wildtype AT(1) receptor. The results suggested that substitution by a positively charged or sterically hindered amino acid in the AT(1) receptor allows it to interact with the acidic tetrazole moiety and carboxylate groups of the antagonists more strongly compared to the wild-type receptor. These findings may play an important role to change the binding affinity of the antagonists to an effective level for the pharmacological function of the drugs.

A common Arg 389 Gly variant polymorphism has been shown in recombinant cells to influence its-coupling properties. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of the Arg 389 Gly beta (1)-adrenoceptor polymorphism on catecholamine-induced lipolysis in native human fat cells obtained by subcutaneous biopsy. SUBJECTS: Two-hundred and ninety-eight apparently healthy male and female subjects with a wide variation in body mass index (BMI, 18-60 kg/m(2)). MEASURES: The lipolytic sensitivities and maximum lipolytic action of noradrenaline and the selective adrenoceptor agonists dobutamine (beta (1)), terbutaline (beta (2)) and CGP 12177 (beta (3)) were determined in isolated subcutaneous adipocytes and related to adrenoceptor radioligand binding parameters. RESULTS: No differences in the sensitivity or maximum lipolytic capacity of the agonists were found between the genotypes. This was true both when all subjects were analyzed together and when subgroups (lean, obese, men, women) were analyzed separately. Radioligand binding to beta (1)- or beta (2)-adrenoceptors was also similar between genotypes. The polymorphism had no important influence on either BMI or the distribution of obese and non-obese subjects between the genotypes. CONCLUSION: The distribution of the Arg 389 Gly polymorphism is similar in lean and obese subjects and has no apparent effect on the lipolytic response to beta -adrenergic stimulation in native human adipocytes. This suggests, despite the altered coupling properties reported in recombinant cells, that the Arg 386 Gly polymorphism has no important influence on human obesity.

In vivo imaging does not allow to determine the cells in which TSPO is altered. We propose a methodology based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting to sort different cell types of radioligand-treated tissues. We compared left/right hippocampus of rats in response to a unilateral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) or saline. We finally applied this methodology in human samples (Alzheimer's disease patients and controls). Our data show that the pattern of TSPO overexpression differs across animal models of acute neuroinflammation. LPS induces a microglial expansion and an increase in microglial TSPO binding. CNTF is associated with an increase in TSPO binding in microglia and astrocytes in association with an increase in the number of microglial binding sites per cell. In humans, we show that the increase in CLINDE binding in Alzheimer's disease concerns microglia and astrocytes in the presence of a microglial expansion. Thus, the cellular basis of TSPO overexpression is condition dependent, and alterations in TSPO binding found in PET/SPECT imaging studies cannot be attributed to particular cell types indiscriminately.

Tb-149-PSMA-617 was prepared with >98% radiochemical purity (6 MBq/nmol) for the treatment of mice with PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumors. Tb-149-PSMA-617 was applied at 1 x 6 MBq (Day 0) or 2 x 3 MBq (Day 0 & Day 1 or Day 0 & Day 3) and the mice were monitored over time until they had reached a pre-defined endpoint which required euthanasia. The tumor growth was significantly delayed in mice of the treated groups as compared to untreated controls (p < 0.05). TAT was most effective in mice injected with 2 x 3 MBq (Day 0 & 1) resulting in a median lifetime of 36 days, whereas in untreated mice, the median lifetime was only 20 days. Due to the beta(+)-emission of Tb-149, tumor localization was feasible using PET/CT after injection of Tb-149-PSMA-617 (5 MBq). The PET images confirmed the selective accumulation of Tb-149-PSMA-617 in PC-3 PIP tumor xenografts. The unique characteristics of Tb-149 for TAT make this radionuclide of particular interest for future clinical translation, thereby, potentially enabling PET-based imaging to monitor the radioligand's tissue distribution.

Exposures to desipramine for < 1 day reduces only radioligand binding and uptake capacity while transporter-immunoreactivity is unaffected. Recent demonstration of persistent drug retention in cells following desipramine exposures raises the possibility that previous reported changes in the norepinephrine transporter may be partly accountable by residual drug. In this study, potential effects of residual desipramine on norepinephrine transporter binding and uptake were re-evaluated following exposures of PC 12 cells to desipramine using different methods to remove residual drug. Using a method that minimizes residual drug, exposure of intact PC12 cells to desipramine for 4 h had no effect on uptake capacity or [H-3]nisoxetine binding to the norepinephrine transporter, while exposures for >= 16 h reduced uptake capacity. Desipramine-induced reductions in binding to the transporter required > 24 h or greater periods of desipramine exposure. This study confirms that uptake capacity of the norepinephrine transporter is reduced earlier than changes in radioligand binding, but with a different time course than originally shown. Special pre-incubation procedures are required to abolish effects of residual transporter inhibitor when studying inhibitor-induced transporter regulation. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Widespread cell stress and mitochondrial dysfunction occur in patients with early Alzheimer's disease	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							IN-VIVO EVALUATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; OXIDATIVE STRESS; AMYLOID DEPOSITION; RECEPTOR-BINDING; BRAIN; SIGMA(1); ATROPHY; SA4503; LIGAND	Cell stress and impaired oxidative phosphorylation are central to mechanisms of synaptic loss and neurodegeneration in the cellular pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we quantified the in vivo expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, sigma 1 receptor (S1R), using [C-11]SA4503 positron emission tomography (PET), the mitochondrial complex I (MC1) with [F-18]BCPP-EF, and the presynaptic vesicular protein SV2A with [C-11]UCB-J in 12 patients with early AD and in 16 cognitively normal controls. We integrated these molecular measures with assessments of regional brain volumes and cerebral blood flow ( CBF) measured with magnetic resonance imaging arterial spin labeling. Eight patients with AD were followed longitudinally to estimate the rate of change of the physiological and structural pathology markers with disease progression. The patients showed widespread increases in S1R (<= 27%) and regional reduction in MC1 (>= -28%) and SV2A (>= -25%) radioligand binding, brain volume (>= -23%), and CBF (>= -26%). [F-18]BCPP-EF PET MC1 binding (>= -12%) and brain volumes (>= -5%) showed progressive reductions over 12 to 18 months, suggesting that they both could be used as pharmacodynamic indicators in early-stage therapeutics trials. Associations of reduced MC1 and SV2A and increased S1R radioligand binding with reduced cognitive performance in AD, although exploratory, suggested a loss of metabolic functional reserve with disease. Our study thus provides in vivo evidence for widespread, clinically relevant cellular stress and bioenergetic abnormalities in early AD.

J	Bögemann, M				Boegemann, Martin			Systematic action-Emergencies in systemic cancer therapy!	UROLOGIE			German	Article						Uro-oncology; Systemic therapy; Adverse events; Checkpoint inhibitors; Extravasation of diagnostic and therapeutic materials	CARE	Background: A multitude of treatment options for the systemic treatment of urologic cancer have become available in recent years. In addition to classical chemotherapy or androgen-deprivation therapy, other approaches like targeted therapies (e.g., tyrosine kinase inhibitors), checkpoint inhibitors, and new approaches like radioligand therapies are increasingly used. Whether treating their own patients or caring for patients who receive these compounds fromother physicians in the field, urologistswill inevitably be confronted with adverse events associated with these diverse therapies. This development will continue to grow as new compounds are continuously being registered and even new drug classes are being developed. Therefore, every urologist should know the basics regarding prophylaxis, control of adverse events, and especially management of emergency situations associated with systemic treatment in urooncology. Objectives: To provide an overview of typical emergency situations and their management in genitourinary cancers. Methods: Summary of common uro-oncological emergency situations associated with systemic therapy. Results: The urologist requires expert knowledge in the management of emergencies within systemic treatment of genitourinary cancers like neutropenic fever during chemotherapy, hand-foot syndrome with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, immune-related adverse events, but also of side effects occurring in patients treated by other physicians, e.g., during radioligand therapies administered by nuclear physicians. Conclusions: Basic knowledge on the typical side effects and emergencies that are associated with compounds used in the treatment of genitourinary cancers is essential. Continuous medical education to be able to handle the new developments in this rapidly evolving field is mandatory.

The vessels were isolated using an iron oxide-sieving method. [H-3]prazosin bound to a single class of binding sites (K-d 0.087 +/- 0.012 nM, B-max 326 +/- 56 fmol/mg protein). Phentolamine displaced [H-3]prazosin (0.2 nM) with a pK(i) of 8.37 +/- 0.09. Competition with the selective alpha (1A)- adrenoceptor antagonist 5-methylurapidil fit a two-site model (pK(i) 9.38 +/- 0.21 and 7.94 +/- 0.15); 59 +/- 3% of the sites were high-affinity, and 41 +/- 3% were low-affinity binding sites. Competition with the alpha (1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist 8-(2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl)-8-azaspiro[4.5] decane-7,9-dione dihydrochloride (BMY-7378) fit a one-site model with low affinity (pK(i) 6.83 +/- 0.03). The relative contents of alpha (1A)- alpha (1B)-, and alpha (1D)-adrenoceptor mRNAs were 64 +/- 5, 25 +/- 5, and 11 +/- 1%, respectively. Thus there was a very good correlation between mRNA and receptor binding for the subtypes. These data indicate a predominance of the alpha (1A)-adrenoceptor subtype in rat renal resistance vessels, with smaller densities of alpha (1B)- and alpha (1D)-adrenoceptors.

The chimeric receptor CXP, in which the NT of mCRFR1 was annealed to the TMs of PTH1R, and the reciprocal hybrid, PXC, bound radiolabeled analogues of sauvagine and PTH(3-34), respectively. Neither hybrid bound radiolabeled CRF or PTH(1-34). CRF and PTH(1-34) weakly stimulated intracellular cAMP accumulation in COS-7 cells transfected with PXC and CXP, respectively. Thus the NT is required for ligand binding and the TMs are required for agonist-stimulated cAMP accumulation. Replacing individual intercysteine segments of PXC with their mCRFR1 counterparts did not rescue CRF or sauvagine radioligand binding or stimulation of cAMP accumulation. Replacement of residues 1-31 of mCRFR1 with their PTH1R counterparts resulted in a chimeric receptor, PEG, which had normal CRFR1 functional properties. In addition, a series of chimeras (F1PEC-F6PEC) were generated by replacement of the NT intercysteine residues of PEC with their PTH1R counterparts. Only F1PEC, F2PEC, and F3PEC showed detectable CRF and sauvagine radioligand binding. All of the PEC chimeras except F5PEC increased cAMP accumulation. These data indicate that the Cys(68-)Glu(109) domain is important for binding and that the Cys(87)-Cys(102) region plays an important role in CRFR1 activation.

Radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA in metastasized castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) achieves objective response and disease stabilization in roughly two third of patients, whereas one third of patients progress. This study was performed to assess the role of interim PSMA PET/CT after the 2(nd) cycle of RLT for early prediction of overall survival in patients undergoing RLT with Lu-177-PSMA. Methods 38 mCRPC patients (68.9 +/- 8.1 y) treated with at least two cycles of RLT at 8 week intervals and interim Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT (PET) at 8-10 weeks after the 2(nd) cycle of RLT were included in this study. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was evaluated according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 criteria. Radiographic response assessment of soft tissue, lymph node, and bone lesions was performed according to RECIST 1.1 including the PET component. Patients' data were collected for follow-up from the local Comprehensive Cancer Center Register. Results Median follow-up was 19.7 months (4.7-45.3). PSA response after the 2(nd) therapy cycle showed partial remission (PR) in 23.7%, stable disease (SD) in 50%, and progressive disease (PD) in 26.3% of patients. In comparison, 52.6, 23.7, and 23.7% of patients showed PR, SD, and PD respectively on PET/CT. The strength of agreement between PSA response and PET/CT response criteria was only fair (kappa 0.346). Median overall survival (OS) was 22.5 months (95% CI: 15.8-29.2). Median OS stratified to PSA/PET response was 25.6/25.6 months for PR, 21.7/30.6 months for SD and 19.4/13.1 months for PD (p = 0.496 for PSA and 0.013 for PET/CT response). Conclusions Interim PSMA PET/CT based response evaluation at 8-10 weeks after the 2(nd) cycle of RLT is predictive of overall survival and PD in patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA. On the contrary, PSA appears to have only limited predictive value.

Clinical Outcomes of <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA Radioligand Therapy in Earlier and Later Phases of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Grouped by Previous Taxane Chemotherapy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Lu-177-PRLT; lutetium; prostate-specific membrane antigen; radioligand therapy; chemotherapy	INCREASED SURVIVAL; DOCETAXEL; PSMA; MITOXANTRONE; ABIRATERONE; PREDNISONE; ENZALUTAMIDE; CABAZITAXEL; SAFETY	Lu-177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy using PSMA-617 and PSMA-I&T ligands (Lu-177-PRLT) is an emerging treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). This retrospective study evaluates clinical outcomes of Lu-177-PRLT in earlier and later phases of mCRPC grouped by previous taxane chemotherapy. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed on 167 patients with mCRPC who underwent Lu-177-PRLT between March 2013 and December 2016. Patients were classified as either taxane chemotherapy pretreated (T-pretreated) or naive (T-naive) depending on whether they had received taxane-based chemotherapy prior to Lu-177-PRLT. Clinical outcome for T-pretreated and T-naive patients was assessed by overall survival (OS), radiographic progression-free survival, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed for both T-pretreated and T-naive patients to determine predictors of outcome. Toxicity was categorized by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). Results: Of the 167 patients treated with Lu-177-PRLT, 83 were T-pretreated and 84 were T-naive. At baseline, T-pretreated patients had overall poorer performance status, a higher prevalence of bone metastases, higher PSA levels, lower hemoglobin levels, higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels and had received more additional therapies compared with T-naive patients. Median OS was 10.7 mo for T-pretreated patients and 27.1 mo for T-naive patients. Median radiographic progression-free survival was 6.0 mo for T-pretreated patients and 8.8 mo for T-naive patients. PSA response assessment was evaluable in 132 patients and seen in 25 of 62 (40%) T-pretreated patients and 40 of 70 (57%) T-naive patients. Significant determinates of inferior OS in multivariable analysis for T-pretreated patients were poorer performance status, lower cumulative administered activity, and lower baseline hemoglobin. Higher baseline alkaline phosphatase was the only significant determinate of inferior OS in multivariable analysis for T-naive patients. Overall Lu-177-PRLT was safe, with minimal adverse effects evident during follow-up in both T-pretreated and T-naive patients. Conclusion: Lu-177-PRLT is a promising therapy in mCRPC, with encouraging outcomes and minimal associated toxicity seen in both our T-naive and heavily pretreated patient cohorts.

The complex research is based on radioligand-receptor method of analysis and covers such points of peptides molecular activity as: specific binding of peptides to brain cells plasmatic membranes, formation of tissue specific synacton, influence of peptides (as allosteric modulators) on functionality of different neuroreceptors as well as delayed in time effects of peptides on receptor-binding activity of well-known neuroreceptor systems. Radiolabeled ligands in such complex study are the one of the best and precision instruments to uncover the molecular mechanism of multiple and multitarget biological effects of regulatory peptides. In this issue we used heptapeptide Semax as a model regulatory peptide, [H-3]Ach and [H-3]GABA as an effector molecules, and the rat model of stress-induced memory and behavior impairment as a morbid state. We showed the ability of Semax to modulate in a dose-dependent manner [H-3]Ach and [H-3]GABA specific binding to some of its corresponding receptors as well as to affect the number of [H-3]GABA specific binding places on rat neurons plasmatic membranes after complex stress exposure.

This chapter reviews data that support antagonist-induced upregulation specifically of opioid receptors but many of the principles apply to other GPCRs as well. It is well documented that chronic exposure to opioid receptor antagonists reliably produces increases in binding to opioid receptors when the antagonists are administered in vivo or applied in vitro to cell culture systems. Antagonist exposure increases receptor number and is associated with functional supersensitivity to subsequent agonist administration. For example, the analgesic potency of morphine is increased following prior administration of opioid receptor antagonists. Likewise, coupling of opioid receptors to G proteins is increased following antagonist exposure, as is the ability of opioid agonists to regulate adenylyl cyclase activity. The most common approach used to measure receptor upregulation is radioligand receptor binding. This chapter includes methods to measure receptor number by radioligand binding and by immunohistochemical approaches. Also included are methods to assess alterations in receptor function following antagonist exposure. The methods can be applied to tissue or cell homogenates or to in situ preparations in order to increase the anatomical specificity of the resulting data.

In order to keep the animals in a restricted position during the scan session, anaesthesia is almost inevitable. In ex vivo rat studies we investigated the interference of ketamine/xylazine, zoletile mixture, isoflurane and halothane with the serotonin re-uptake site, the serotonin(2A) receptor and the dopamine re-uptake site by use of [H-3]-(S)-citalopram, [F-18]altanserin and [I-125]PE2I, respectively. Ketamine/xylazine decreased the target-to-background ratio (mean +/- SD) of [H-3]-(S)-citalopram from 1.5+/-0.19 to 0.81+/-0.19 (P<0.05), whereas isoflurane and halothane increased the ratio from 1.5+/-0.19 to 1.9+/-0.24 and 2.1+/-0.13 (P<0.05), respectively. Only with the zoletile mixture did the ratio remain unaltered. None of the tested anaesthetics affected the target-to-background ratio of [F-18]altanserin. The [I-125]PE2I target-to-background ratio decreased with both ketamine/xylazine (from 12.4+/-0.81 to 10.1+/-1.4, P<0.05) and isoflurane (from 12.4+/-0.81 to 9.5+/-1.1, P<0.05) treated rats, whereas treatment with zoletile mixture and halothane left the ratio unaltered. It is concluded that prior to performance of neuroreceptor radioligand studies, the possible interaction between radioligands and anaesthetics should be carefully evaluated.

The three beta -AR subtypes showed the nature of G protein-coupled receptors with the constitutive activity. BRL37344, CL-316,243 and a newly synthesized beta (3)-AR agonist N-5984, 6-[2-(R)-[[2-(R)-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino]propyl]-2, 3-dihydro-1, 4- benzodioxine-2-(R)-carboxylic acid, were compared for the potency and selectivity for the beta (3)-AR. In the radioligand binding assay, the affinity of N-5984 for beta (3)-ARs was 14, 70 and 220 times more potent than those of BRL37344, isoproterenol and CL-316, 243, respectively. N-5984 had higher selectivity than BRL37344 for human beta (3)-ARs compared with either for beta (1)-ARs or beta (2)-ARs. N-5984 showed higher potency and intrinsic activity of cAMP production than BRL37344 in CHO cells expressing the beta (3)-ARs. CL-316, 243 had almost no activity of cAMP production in CHO cells expressing any subtype of beta -ARs. These results indicate that N-5984 is the most potent and selective agonist for human beta (3)-ARs than any other agonists tested.

In this study, we describe radiosynthesis of [C-11]4 and evaluation of its binding characteristics in post-mortem human brain autoradiography and with PET in cynomolgus monkeys. The 11C labelled 4 was synthesized by using [C-11] methyltriflate in a methylation reaction with its phenolic precursor with good incorporation yield (64 +/- 11%, DCY) and high specific radioactivity > 370 GBq/mu mol (> 10 000 Ci/mmol). In post-mortem human brain autoradiography [C-11]4 exhibited high specific binding in brain regions enriched with dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors and low level of non-specific binding. In cynomolgus monkeys [C-11]4 exhibited high brain uptake reaching 4.4% ID at 7.5 min. The binding in the extrastriatal low density D-2-receptor regions; thalamus and frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex, was clearly visible. Pre-treatment with raclopride (1 mg/kg as tartrate) caused high reduction of binding in extrastriatal regions, including cerebellum. [C-11]4 is a promising radioligand for imaging D2 receptors in low density regions in brain. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Concerns of potential nephrotoxicity are based on renal tubular PSMA expression and the resulting radiopharmaceutical retention during RLT, but data confirming clinically significant renal toxicity are still lacking. In this study, n = 22 patients treated within a prospective patient registry (REALITY Study) with significantly impaired baseline kidney function were investigated for treatment-associated nephrotoxicity and the potential relationship with administered activities of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. As opposed to prevailing concerns, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) improved significantly in our cohort of patients and no significant correlation between change in GFR and administered activities were found. As pre-treatment chronic kidney failure did not lead to detectable RLT-induced deterioration of renal function in our study, the nephrotoxic potential of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT may be overestimated. We suggest not to categorically exclude patients from enrolment to PSMA-RLT due to renal impairment. Background: Radioligand therapy (RLT) targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an effective antitumor-treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma (mCRPC). Concerns of potential nephrotoxicity are based on renal tubular PSMA expression and the resulting radiopharmaceutical retention during RLT, but data confirming clinically significant renal toxicity are still lacking. In this study, patients with significantly impaired baseline kidney function before initiation of therapy were investigated for treatment-associated nephrotoxicity and the potential relationship with administered activities of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Methods: Twenty-two mCRPC patients with impaired renal function (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <= 60 mL/min) who received more than two cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT (median 5 cycles and median 6-week time interval between consecutive cycles) were analyzed in this study. Patients were treated within a prospective patient registry (REALITY Study, NCT04833517). Cumulative administered activities ranged from 17.1 to 85.6 GBq with a median activity of 6.5 GBq per cycle. Renal function was closely monitored during and after PSMA-RLT. Results: Mean pre-treatment GFR was 45.0 +/- 10.7 mL/min. After two (22/22 patients), four (20/22 patients), and six cycles (10/22 patients) of RLT, a significant increase of GFR was noted (each p < 0.05). End-of-treatment GFR (54.1 +/- 16.7 mL/min) was significantly higher than baseline GFR (p = 0.016). Only one patient experienced deterioration of renal function (change of CTCAE grade 2 to 3). The remaining patients showed no significant reduction of GFR, including follow-up assessments (6, 9, and 12 months), and even showed improved (10/22 patients) or unchanged (11/22 patients) CTCAE-based renal impairment grades during and after the end of PSMA-RLT. No significant correlation between the change in GFR and per-cycle (p = 0.605) or cumulative (p = 0.132) administered activities were found. Conclusions: As pre-treatment chronic kidney failure did not lead to detectable RLT-induced deterioration of renal function in our study, the nephrotoxic potential of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 RLT may be overestimated and not of clinical priority in the setting of palliative treatment in mCRPC. We suggest not to categorically exclude patients from enrolment to PSMA-RLT due to renal impairment.

This study in a consecutive cohort of 39 such patients from central Greece investigates (1) the prevalence of non-organ and liver-related autoantibodies, and (2) the reactivity of anti-liver-kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies (in the case of positivity with at least one of the methods used) against their molecularly defined antigens. Design All serum samples were tested by standard and molecular assays for the presence of anti-nuclear antibodies, smooth muscle antibodies, anti-liver-kidney microsomal type 1 antibodies, antibodies against parietal cells, anti-CYP2A6, anti-CYP1A2 and anti-CYP2D6 autoantibodies. Methods Indirect immunofluorescence, competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, immunoblotting and novel radioligand assays based on immunoprecipitation of [S-35]-methionine labelled recombinant CYP2A6, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 His-taq fusion proteins produced by in vitro transcription/translation were used. Results Seven out of 39 patients (17.9%) tested positive for smooth muscle antibodies, 2/39 (5.1%) tested positive for anti-nuclear antibodies, 1/39 (2.5%) tested positive for parietal cell antibodies, and 4/39 (10.3%) were found to be anti-liver-kidney microsomal positive (with at least one of the methods used). All sera were negative for anti-CYP2A6 and anti-CYP1A2 autoantibodies. Three out of four anti-liver-kidney microsomal positive samples had the typical liver-kidney microsomal staining pattern shown by indirect immunofluorescence. However, none tested positive for anti-CYP2D6 autoantibodies using the competitive CYP2D6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the specific CYP2D6 radioligand assay, and western blot using either human microsomes or recombinant CYP2D6. The fourth patient tested negative for anti-liver-kidney autoantibodies by either indirect immunofluorescence or the competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, but was repeatedly positive for anti-CYP2D6 autoantibodies by the sensitive and specific radioligand assay. Western blot experiments using human microsomes in this patient serum revealed two bands of 50 kDa and 55 kDa that documented as anti-CYP2D6 and anti-uridine triphosphate glucuronosyltransferase autoantibodies when recombinant CYP2D6 and recombinant uridine triphosphate glucuronosyltransferase autoantigens were used for immunoblot, respectively. Conclusions A relatively high incidence of anti-liver-kidney microsomal autoantibodies (10.3%) was found in a consecutive sample of Greek patients with hepatitis C. The expanded panel of assays, however, failed to document CYP2D6 as the target autoantigen of anti-liver-kidney microsomal autoantibodies in most patients. We report for the first time the detection of parietal cell antibodies and both anti-CYP2D6 (anti-liver-kidney microsomal type 1) and anti-uridine triphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (anti-liver-kidney microsomal type 3) autoantibodies in patients who were hepatitis C positive/hepatitis D negative. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings and to determine whether these preliminary results have a clinical importance or not.

Given their advanced disease stage, most patients scheduled for PentixaTher RLT require concomitant or bridging chemotherapy to prevent intermittent tumor progression. These (mostly combination) therapies may cause significant downregulation of tumoral CXCR4 expression, challenging the applicability of PentixaTher RLT. This study therefore aimed at investigating the influence of corticosteroids, a central component of these chemotherapies, on CXCR4 regulation in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).MethodsDifferent DLBCL cell lines (Daudi, OCI-LY1, SUDHL-4, -5-, -6 and -8) as well as the human T-cell lymphoma cell line Jurkat were incubated with Dexamethasone (Dex; 0.5 and 5 mu M, respectively) and Prednisolone (Pred; 5 and 50 mu M, respectively) for different time points (2 h, 24 h). Treatment-induced modulation of cellular CXCR4 surface expression was assessed via flow cytometry (FC) and compared to untreated cells. A radioligand binding assay with [I-125]CPCR4.3 was performed in parallel using the same cells. To quantify potential corticosteroid treatment effects on tumoral CXCR4 expression in vivo, OCI-LY1 bearing NSG mice were injected 50 mu g Dex/mouse i.p. (daily for 6 days). Then, a biodistribution study (1 h p.i.) using [Ga-68]PentixaTher was performed, and tracer biodistribution in treated (n = 5) vs untreated mice (n = 5) was compared.ResultsIn the in vitro experiments, a strongly cell line-dependent upregulation of CXCR4 was observed for both Dex and Pred treatment, with negligible differences between the high and low dose. While in Jurkat, Daudi and SUDHL-8 cells, CXCR4 expression remained unchanged, a 1.5- to 3.5-fold increase in CXCR4 cell surface expression was observed for SUDHL-5 < SUDHL-4 /-6 < OCI-LY1 via FC compared to untreated cells. This increase in CXCR4 expression was also reflected in correspondingly enhanced [I-125]CPCR4.3 accumulation in treated cells, with a linear correlation between FC and radioligand binding data. In vivo, Dex treatment led to a general increase of [Ga-68]PentixaTher uptake in all organs compared to untreated animals, as a result of a higher tracer concentration in blood. However, we observed an overproportionally enhanced [Ga-68]PentixaTher uptake in the OCI-LY1 tumors in treated (21.0 +/- 5.5%iD/g) vs untreated (9.2 +/- 2.8%iD/g) mice, resulting in higher tumor-to-background ratios in the treatment group.ConclusionOverall, corticosteroid treatment (Dex/Pred) consistently induced an upregulation of CXCR4 expression DBLCL cells in vitro, albeit in a very cell line-dependent manner. For the cell line with the most pronounced Dex-induced CXCR4 upregulation, OCI-LY1, the in vitro findings were corroborated by an in vivo biodistribution study. This confirms that at least the corticosteroid component of stabilizing chemotherapy regimens in DLBCL patients prior to [Lu-177]Lu-PentixaTher RLT does not lead to downregulation of the molecular target CXCR4 and may even have a beneficiary effect. However, further studies are needed to investigate if and to what extent the other commonly used chemotherapeutic agents affect CXCR4 expression on DLBCL to ensure the choice of an appropriate treatment regimen prior to [Lu-177]Lu/[Y-90]Y-PentixaTher RLT.

We herein describe the synthesis of a new set of fluorescent ligands, structurally derived from D1R antagonist SCH-23390 and labeled with two different fluorescent dyes, as tool compounds for the visualization of D-1-like receptors. Pharmacological characterization in radioligand binding studies identified UR-NR435 (25) as a high-affinity ligand for D-1-like receptors (pK(i) (D1R)=8.34, pK(i) (D5R)=7.62) with excellent selectivity towards D-2-like receptors. Compound 25 proved to be a neutral antagonist at the D1R and D5R in a G(s) heterotrimer dissociation assay, an important feature to avoid receptor internalization and degradation when working with whole cells. The neutral antagonist 25 displayed rapid association and complete dissociation to the D1R in kinetic binding studies using confocal microscopy verifying its applicability for fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, molecular brightness studies determined a single-digit nanomolar binding affinity of the ligand, which was in good agreement with radioligand binding data. For this reason, this fluorescent ligand is a useful tool for a sophisticated characterization of native D-1 receptors in a variety of experimental setups.

From our results, 2S-LP2 (5) showed an improved pharmacological profile in comparison to LP2 (1) and 2R-LP2 (4). 2S-LP2 (5) elicited an antinociceptive effect with a 1.5- and 3-times higher potency than LP2 (I) and R-antipode (4), respectively. In vivo effect of 2S-LP2 (5) was consistent with the improved MOR/DOR efficacy profile assessed by radioligand binding assay, to evaluate the opioid receptor affinity, and BRET assay, to evaluate the capability to promote receptor/G-protein and receptor/beta-arrestin 2 interaction. 2S-LP2 (5) was able to activate, with different efficacy, G-protein pathway over beta-arrestin 2, behaving as biased agonist at MOR and mainly at DOR Considering the therapeutic potential of both multitarget MOR/DOR agonism and functional selectivity over G-protein, the 2S-LP2 (5) biased multitarget MOR/DOR agonist could provide a safer treatment opportunity.

Agonists and antagonists induce different palonosetron dissociation rates in 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>AB receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin receptor; Allosteric binding site; Site-directed mutagenesis; Radioligand binding; FlexStation assays	5-HT3 RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL PROFILE; RS-25259-197; GRANISETRON; SUBUNIT; BINDING; CA2+	Palonosetron is a potent 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a unique structure and some unusual properties. Here we explore the properties of palonosetron at heterologously expressed 5-HT(3)A and 5-HT(3)AB receptors. We used receptors expressed in HEK293 cells, and functionally analysed them using a membrane potential sensitive dye in a Flexstation, which revealed IC(50)s of 0.24 nM and 0.18 nM for 5-HT(3)A and 5-HT(3)AB receptors respectively. Radioligand binding studies with [H-3]palonosetron revealed similar K(d)s: 0.34 nM for 5-HT(3)A and 0.15 nM for 5-HT(3)AB receptors. Kinetic studies showed palonosetron association and dissociation rates were slightly faster in 5-HT(3)AB than 5-HT(3)A receptors, and for both subtypes dissociation rates were ligand-dependent, with antagonists causing more rapid dissociation than agonists. Similar ligand effects were not observed for [H-3]granisetron dissociation studies. These data support previous studies which show palonosetron has actions distinct to other 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, and the slow rates observed for agonist induced dissociation (t(1/2) > 10 h) could at least partly explain the long duration of palonosetron effects in vivo.

The AT, antagonists used in this study were valsartan, candesartan and losartan. Main methods: AT(1) receptor structural model was constructed by homology modeling using structural models of rhodopsin photointermediates. Through molecular modeling, possible binding sites for these drugs were suggested to lie between transmembrane domains (TM) 3, 5, and 6 of AT(1) receptor. Key findings: The carboxylic acid group and tetrazole ring of valsartan possibly interact with Lys199 of TM5 and Ser109 of TM3 and Asn295 of TM7 of AT(1) receptor, respectively. In candesartan, carboxylic group, tetrazole ring, and ethoxy group oxygen possibly interact with Lys199 of TM5, Ser109 of TM3 and Asn295 of TM7 and Gln257 of TM6, respectively. In losartan, tetrazole ring and hydroxymethyl group possibly interact with Asn295 of TM7 and Ser109 of TM3, respectively. Significance: The results of the present study suggested that candesartan interacts at a higher number of binding sites compared to valsartan whereas losartan has a lower number of binding sites with the amino acid residues of the AT(1) receptor. These findings are consistent with the data of the radioligand-binding studies of the antagonists with the AT(1) receptor. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The biodistribution of (+)-[(11)C]A-69024 in rats and baboons showed a rapid brain uptake (reaching a maximal value at 5 and 15 min postinjection in rats and baboons, respectively), followed by a slow wash out. The region/cerebellum concentration ratio was characterized by a fourfold higher uptake in striatum and a twofold higher uptake in cortical regions, consistent with in vivo specific binding of the radiotracer in these cerebral regions. Furthermore, this specific (+)-[(11)C]A-69024 binding significantly correlated with the reported in vitro distribution of dopamine D1-receptors. Finally, the specific uptake of the tracer in the striatum and cortical regions was completely prevented by either a pretreatment with large doses of nonradioactive (+/-)A-69024 or of the D1-selective antagonist SCH23390, resulting in a similar uptake in the reference region (cerebellum) and in other brain regions. Thus, (+)-[(11)C]A-69024 appears to be a specific and enantioselective radioligand to visualize and quantify brain dopamine D1 receptors in vivo using positron emission tomography.

We found that substitution of phenylalanine 185 in transmembrane region IV by alanine or methionine resulted in a reduced number of receptors in the coupled conformation, as well as a reduced affinity of 5-HT for the uncoupled conformation. In contrast, substitution of phenylalanine 331 in transmembrane region VI by alanine increased the affinity of 5-HT for the uncoupled conformation 11-fold thus reducing the agonist low-affinity to agonist high-affinity (K-il/K-ih) ratio 5-fold. This reduced ratio was correlated with a significantly reduced intrinsic activity of 5-HT previously determined by its ability to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. In conclusion, these results show that single amino acid substitutions can selectively change the affinity of 5-HT for the G protein uncoupled conformation of the 5-HT1B receptor and alter the intrinsic activity of the ligand.

FAUC346 has been labeled using [C-11]methyl triflate in acetone containing aqueous NaOH (5 Eq) at - 10 degrees C for 1 min, purified on seimpreparative reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and formulated as an intravenous injectable solution using a Sep-Pak Plus C-18 device. Up to 5.5 GBq of [(11)]FAUC346 (N-[4-[4-(2-[methy]-C-11]methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]benzo[ [b] thiophene-2-carboxamide), with a specific radioactivity of 45-75 GBq/mu mol, could be obtained in 30-35 min, including HPLC purification and formulation starting from 44.4 GBq of [(11)]carbon dioxide. Preliminary pharmacological evaluation of [C-11]FAUC346 in rat brain clearly demonstrated in vivo selectivity for D-3 receptors and the absence of radiolabeled metabolite within the brain. These encouraging results, however, could not be confirmed in nonhuman primates; therefore, this radioligand does not appear to have the required pharmacological profile for a positron emission tomography probe for imaging D-3 receptors.

In nonhuman primates, we examined the accuracy of simplified quantification methods and the estimates of radiation dose of [F-18]FE-PE2I . Methods: In the quantification study, binding potential (BPND) values previously reported in three rhesus monkeys using kinetic and graphical analyses of [F-18]FE-PE2I were used for comparison. BPND using the cerebellum as reference region was obtained with four reference tissue methods applied to the [F-18]FE-PE2I data that were compared with the kinetic and graphical analyses. In the whole-body study, estimates of adsorbed radiation were obtained in two cynomolgus monkeys. Results: All reference tissue methods provided BPND values within 5% of the values obtained with the kinetic and graphical analyses. The shortest imaging time for stable BPND estimation was 54 min. The average effective dose of [F-18]FE-PE2I was 0.021 mSv/MBq, similar to 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose. Conclusions: The results in nonhuman primates suggest that [F-18]FE-PE2I is suitable for accurate and stable DAT quantification, and its radiation dose estimates would allow for a maximal administered radioactivity of 476 MBq in human subjects.

Synthetic modification of the convulsant marine toxin neodysiherbaine A (NDH) previously yielded molecules with a diverse set of pharmacological actions on kainate receptors. Here we characterize three new synthetic analogs of NDH that contain substituents at the C10 position in the pyran ring of the marine toxin. The analogs exhibited high-affinity binding to the GluK1 (GluR5) subunit and lower affinity binding to GluK2 (GluR6) and GluK3 (GluR7) subunits in radioligand displacement assays with recombinant kainate and AMPA receptors. As well, the natural toxin NDH exhibited similar to 100-fold selectivity for GluK2 over GluK3 subunits, which was attributable to the C8 hydroxyl group in NDH. We used molecular dynamic simulations to determine the specific interactions between NDH and residues within the ligand-binding domains of these two kainate receptor subunits that contribute to the divergent apparent affinities for the compound. These data demonstrate that interactions with the GluKI subunit are preserved in analogs with substitutions at C10 in NDH and further reveal the determinants of selectivity and pharmacological activity of molecules acting on kainate receptor subunits. which could aid in design of additional compounds that target these receptors.

Radioactive assays are "gold standard" because they are fast, easy, and reproducible; however, they are hazardous, produce radioactive waste, require special lab conditions, and are expensive on a large scale. Thus, it provides a lot of importance to the "mix & measure" assays that have an optical readout. Fluorescence techniques are likely to be among the most important detection approaches used for high throughput screening due to their high sensitivity and amenability to automation. The aim of the present study was to determine the functional antagonistic affinities of standard muscarinic antagonists in CHO cells over expressing m1, m3, and m5 receptors and to compare them with the respective binding affinities. This study was further extended to elucidate that Ca+2 measurement assays can serve as a functional screening tool for GPCRs. For this purpose, standard muscarinic receptor antagonists, namely, tolterodine, oxybutynin, and atropine were used. We determined and compard the IC50 values of these three standard inhibitors in fura 2 AM loaded m1, m3, and m5 overexpressing CHO cells and in radioligand binding assay. Both the assays exhibited comparable rank order potencies of the standard inhibitors. This study suggests that Ca+2 mobilization assays can be an alternate to radioligand binding assays.

The effect of divalent metal cations on the αv integrin binding site is ligand and integrin specific	BIOMEDICINE & PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Article						alpha v integrins; Divalent metal cations; Radioligand binding; Affinity; Integrin selectivity	ALPHA(V)BETA(3); ALPHA-V-BETA-6; ACTIVATION; AFFINITY; FLUIDS	The binding of orthosteric ligands to integrins requires the presence of divalent metal cations bound to metal ion-binding sites located in the I domains of the integrin alpha and beta subunits. In this study the influence of the type and concentration of divalent metal cation present was investigated on a single arginyl-glycinyl-aspartic acid (RGD) ligand across the alpha v integrin sub-family and single alpha v integrin (alpha v beta 6) with different ligands. These relationships were determined using radioligand binding studies completed with [H-3] ligands and purified alpha v integrin protein preparations. The binding of [H-3]compound 1 to the RGD site on individual alpha v integrins demonstrated a unique profile in relation to the type and concentration of divalent metal cation present. The use of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in simulated lung fluid altered the alpha v integrin selectivity profile of [H-3] compound 1 in terms of affinity and the level of receptor occupancy. In addition, different RGD ligands for the alpha v beta 6 integrin behaved differently under the same divalent metal cation conditions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the need to determine the individual relationship between RGD ligands and the integrins they may engage in vivo, especially when determining selectivity profiles for potential RGD-mimetic small molecule therapeutics, with organ and disease state also considered.

Methods: LNCaP tumor-bearing mice were intraperitoneally injected with MSG (657, 329, or 164 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Fifteen minutes later, the mice were intravenously administered Ga-68-PSMA-11. PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies were performed 1 h after administration. Results: Tumor uptake (percentage injected dose per gram [% ID]) was not statistically different between groups, at 8.42 +/- 1.40% ID in the 657 mg/kg group, 7.19 +/- 0.86 % ID in the 329 mg/kg group, 8.20 +/- 2.44 % ID in the 164 mg/kg group, and 8.67 +/- 1.97 % ID in the PBS group. Kidney uptake was significantly lower in the 657 mg/kg group (85.8 +/- 24.2 % ID) than in the 329 mg/kg (159 +/- 26.2 % ID), 164 mg/kg (211 +/- 27.4% ID), and PBS groups (182 +/- 33.5 % ID) (P < 0.001). Salivary gland uptake was lower in the 657 mg/kg (3.72 +/- 2.12% ID) and 329 mg/kg (5.74 +/- 0.62 % ID) groups than in the PBS group (10.04 +/- 2.52 % ID) (P < 0.01). Conclusion: MSG decreased salivary and kidney uptake of Ga-68-PSMA-11 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas tumor uptake was unaffected.

Development of a specific PDE2A radioligand would enable molecular imaging of the PDE2A protein via positron emission tomography (PET). Herein we report on the syntheses of three novel fluoroalkylated triazine derivatives (TA2-4) and on the evaluation of their effect on the enzymatic activity of human PDE2A. The most potent PDE2A inhibitors were F-18-radiolabelled ([F-18]TA3 and [F-18]TA4) and investigated regarding their potential as PET radioligands for imaging of PDE2A in mouse brain. In vitro autoradiography on rat brain displayed region-specific distribution of [F-18]TA3 and [F-18]TA4, which is consistent with the expression pattern of PDE2A protein. Metabolism studies of both [F-18]TA3 and [F-18]TA4 in mice showed a significant accumulation of two major radiometabolites of each radioligand in brain as investigated by micellar radio-chromatography. Small-animal PET/MR studies in mice using [F-18]TA3 revealed a constantly increasing uptake of activity in the non-target region cerebellum, which may be caused by the accumulation of brain penetrating radiometabolites. Hence, [F-18]TA3 and [F-18]TA4 are exclusively suitable for in vitro investigation of PDE2A. Nevertheless, further structural modification of these promising radioligands might result in metabolically stable derivatives.

Functional efficacy of adenosine A2A receptor agonists is positively correlated to their receptor residence time	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						binding kinetics; residence time; efficacy; adenosine A2A receptor; impedance; label-free technology	ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; INTERNATIONAL UNION; A(2A) AGONISTS; BINDING; CLASSIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE; DERIVATIVES; SELECTIVITY; MECHANISMS; MODELS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The adenosine A2A receptor belongs to the superfamily of GPCRs and is a promising therapeutic target. Traditionally, the discovery of novel agents for the A2A receptor has been guided by their affinity for the receptor. This parameter is determined under equilibrium conditions, largely ignoring the kinetic aspects of the ligand-receptor interaction. The aim of this study was to assess the binding kinetics of A2A receptor agonists and explore a possible relationship with their functional efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We set up, validated and optimized a kinetic radioligand binding assay (a so-called competition association assay) at the A2A receptor from which the binding kinetics of unlabelled ligands were determined. Subsequently, functional efficacies of A2A receptor agonists were determined in two different assays: a novel label-free impedance-based assay and a more traditional cAMP determination. KEY RESULTS A simplified competition association assay yielded an accurate determination of the association and dissociation rates of unlabelled A2A receptor ligands at their receptor. A correlation was observed between the receptor residence time of A2A receptor agonists and their intrinsic efficacies in both functional assays. The affinity of A2A receptor agonists was not correlated to their functional efficacy. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This study indicates that the molecular basis of different agonist efficacies at the A2A receptor lies within their different residence times at this receptor.

Compartmental Modeling of <SUP>11</SUP>C-HOMADAM Binding to the Serotonin Transporter in the Healthy Human Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; serotonin transporter; kinetic modeling	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; H-3 PAROXETINE BINDING; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; MESSENGER-RNA; UPTAKE SITES; PET; LOCALIZATION; QUANTIFICATION	The novel PET radioligand (11)C-NN-dimethyl-2-(2'-amino-4'-hydroxymethylphenylthio)benzylamine ((11)C-HOMADAM) binds with high affinity and selectively to the serotonin transporter (SERT). The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable kinetic model to describe the uptake of (11)C-HOMADAM in the healthy human brain. Methods: Eight volunteers participated in the study; 5 of them were fitted with arterial catheters for blood sampling and all were scanned on a high-resolution research tomograph after the injection of (11)C-HOMADAM. Regional distribution volumes and binding potentials were calculated with 2- and 4-parameter arterial-input compartment models, a 3-parameter reference tissue compartment model, and the Logan graphic approach. Results: The 2-parameter arterial-input compartment model was statistically superior to the 4-parameter model and described all brain regions. Calculated binding potentials agreed well between the arterial-input model and the reference tissue model when the cerebellum was used as the reference tissue. The Logan graphic approach was not able to estimate the higher concentration of SERT in the dorsal raphe than in the midbrain. Conclusion: (11)C-HOMADAM is a highly promising radioligand with high ratios of specific binding to nonspecific binding in known SERT-rich structures, such as the raphe nuclei. The 3-parameter reference tissue model approach permits a simplified quantitatively accurate method for estimating SERT binding potentials.

The stereoconservative asymmetric syntheses started with (-)-cocainhydrochloride (10) from the chiral pool which was transformed into the chiral building blocks (+)-2-tropanone (11) and to (-)-anhydroecgonine (18). Key steps of the syntheses are novel extensions to existing methodology e.g. a Suzuki Pd(0)-mediated cross-coupling of vinyl triflate (12) with the heteroaryl organoboranes 13-15 and an inverse type [4+2]-cycloaddition with 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (21). The bioisosteric replacement of the 3-acetyl pharmacophoric element of the lead 6 by a 3-pyridyl, 5-chloropyridyl, 5-pyrimidinyl, 2-pyrazinyl, or 4-pyridazinyl moiety resulted in nAChR ligands with K-i-values ranging from 1.1-713 nM toward the (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3) subtype combined with significant differentiation among the nAChR subtypes when tested in vitro by radioligand binding studies. Generally the ferrugininoids are less potent than the corresponding norferrugininoids. Similar to results of the norferrugininoid series the novel azine substituted ferrugininoids 8 proved to be more potent than the diazine analogues 9; both exhibited higher affinities compared to the lead 6. The 5-chloropyridyl-containing variant 8b [1R, 5S)-enantiomer] turned out to be the most active nAChR ligand with a 12-fold higher affinity toward the (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3) subtype than the corresponding (1S, 5R)-form ent-8b.

Feeding rats a cafeteria diet has been extensively used as an experimental model to study obesity and energy balance expenditure. The present study investigated whether rats fed a cafeteria diet develop hypertension with alterations in renal cr,adrenoceptor subtype distribution. Weight gain induced by feeding rats a cafeteria diet during 8 weeks was associated with a marked increase in blood pressure. Insulin levels were higher in these hypertensive rats, leading to a decreased plasma glucose/insulin ratio. Based on radioligand-binding studies using [H-3]-RX821002 and selective competitors, a raise in alpha(2)-adrenoceptor density that was solely due to an increased alpha(2)beta-adrenoceptor subtype density was detected in the kidney of the cafeteria-fed rat. Furthermore, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments showed an overexpression of the gene encoding the rr,B-adrenoceptor subtype in these rats. On the other hand, despite a similar mRNA level, the alpha(2)A-adrenoceptor subtype was no more detectable by radioligand-binding studies in the kidney of the cafeteria-fed rat. In conclusion, cafeteria-fed rats are hypertensive, with renal alterations in cu,adrenoceptor distribution. These alterations, which are not related to genetic factors, may play a key role in the onset of hypertension. (C) 2000 American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd.

A variety of aryl substituents including morpholine, pyrazole, triazole, imidazole, and cyclic ether were screened in cell adhesion assays for affinity against alpha(v)beta(1), alpha(v)beta(3), alpha(v)beta(5), alpha(v)beta(6 )and alpha(v)beta(8), integrins. Numerous analogs with high affinity and selectivity for the alpha(v)beta(6) integrin were identified. The analog (S)-3-(3-(3,5-dimethyl-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-4-((R)-3-(2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-1,8-naphthyridin-2-yl)ethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)butanoic acid hydrochloride salt was found to have very high affinity for c0 6 integrin in a radioligand binding assay (pK(i) = 11), a long dissociation half-life (7 h), very high solubility in saline at pH 7 (>71 mg/mL), and pharmacokinetic properties commensurate with inhaled dosing by nebulization. It was selected for further clinical investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.

J	Klein, MT; Teitler, M				Klein, Michael T.; Teitler, Milt			Guinea pig hippocampal 5-HT<sub>1E</sub> receptors: a tool for selective drug development	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						5-hydroxytryptamine 1E receptor; guinea pig; hippocampus; radioligand binding; receptor distribution	SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-CLONING; HUMAN-BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; BINDING-SITES; QUANTITATIVE AUTORADIOGRAPHY; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; RAT-BRAIN; SUBTYPE	Recent studies have indicated that the serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] 1E receptor, originally discovered in human brain tissue, is not expressed in rat or mouse brain. Thus, there have been few reports on 5-HT1E receptor drug development. However, expression of 5-HT1E receptor mRNA has been shown in guinea pig brain. To establish this species as an animal model for 5-HT1E drug development, we identified brain regions that exhibit 5-carboxyamidotryptamine, ritanserin, and LY344864 - insensitive [H-3]5-HT binding (characteristic of the 5-HT1E receptor). In hippocampal homogenates, where 5-HT1E receptor density was sufficiently high for radioligand binding analysis, 100 nM 5-carboxyamidotryptamine, 30 nM ritanserin, and 100 nM LY344864 were used to mask [H-3]5-HT binding at non-5-HT1E receptors. The K-d of [H-3]5-HT was 5.7 +/- 0.7 nM and is indistinguishable from the cloned receptor K-d of 6.5 +/- 0.6 nM. The affinities of 16 drugs for the cloned and hippocampal-expressed guinea pig 5-HT1E receptors are essentially identical (R-2 = 0.97). These findings indicate that using these conditions autoradiographical distribution and signal transduction studies of the 5-HT1E receptor in guinea pig brain are feasible. Using the guinea pig as an animal model should provide important insights into possible functions of this receptor and the therapeutic potential of selective human 5-HT1E drugs.

The diagnosis in each dog was supported by the presence of hypoglycemia (< 60 mg/dL), hyperinsulinemia (> 20 mu IU/mL), and histopathologic review of neoplastic tissue. All insulinomas expressed high-affinity somatostatin receptors of subtype sst2, as shown by receptor autoradiography in vitro using I-125-[tyrosine(3)]-octreotide and I-125-[leucine(8), D-tryptophan(22), tyrosine(25)]-somatostatin-28 with an sst2 subtype-selective analogue. Scintigrams were obtained at 1, 4, 12, and 24 hours after the IV administration of 74-222 MBq of OctreoScan to each patient. Abnormal foci of activity were 1st observed from 1 hour after administration of the radioligand in dog 3, to 24 hours after its administration in dog 4; in dogs 1 and 2, abnormal foci of activity were visible from 12 hours. Dog 5 showed a questionable abnormal focus of activity at 12 hours, but not at 24 hours. Scintigraphy enabled accurate prediction of the anatomical location of the primary tumor in I of 4 dogs, but was unable to differentiate a right- from a left- pancreatic lobe tumor, or vice versa, in 3 dogs; the 5th dog had equivocal results. In-111-pentetreotide scintigraphy is a useful diagnostic adjunct to the clinical evaluation of the insulinoma patient, but is unable to localize the tumor in some cases.

The radiosynthesis procedure consisted of O-methylation of des-methyl precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide in the presence of potassium hydroxide in dimethylformamide (DMF) at 80 degreesC. [C-11]RN5 was obtained in >99% radiochemical purity in 25 min with a radiochemical yield in the 20-30% range, end of synthesis (EOS) (non-decay corrected) and a specific radioactivity of 92.5 +/- 18.5 GBq/mumol. Pre-clinical studies in rats showed a high uptake of [C-11]RN5 in heart, spleen, adrenal gland. lung and kidney but not in the brain. Inhibition studies with high doses of different adrenergic antagonists indicate that more than 70% of myocardial uptake of [C-11]RN5 is due to specific binding to alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Our results indicate that [C-11]RN5 is suitable to be further developed as a potential radioligand for the in vivo PET imaging of myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in humans.

Materials and methods F-18-PBR06 was synthesized using a Synthra RNplus module automatically. RAW264.7 cells were used for cell binding study with F-18-PBR06. In-vivo micro-PET/CT imaging for ApoE(-/-) mice and C57 mice was performed 1 h after injection of F-18-PBR06. CD68(+) and F480 immunofluorescence stainings were performed in the aorta tissues. Results In-vitro cell studies showed uptake of F-18-PBR06 to RAW264.7 cells. Micro-PET/CT imaging identified the atherosclerotic lesions in the aortic arch of ApoE(-/-) mice successfully, whereas no signal was observed in C57 mice. The ratio of plaque-to-muscle in ApoE(-/-) mice of 32 weeks was significantly higher than that in ApoE(-/-) mice of 22 weeks, which was confirmed by CD68(+) immunofluorescence staining and F480 immunofluorescence staining. Conclusion TSPO radioligand F-18-PBR06 allows noninvasive PET/CT imaging of macrophage-abundant atherosclerotic plaques as well as positive correlation between PET imagings and ex-vivo immunofluorescence staining of plaques in mice with different ages, thereby representing a potential attractive tool for evaluating the vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques towards rupture.

Radiolabeled U-II and ANG TI bound specifically to HSMM with K-d's of 0.31 nM (2311 receptors/cell) and 0.61 nM (18,257 receptors/cell), respectively. The cyclic segment of U-II peptide, CFWKYC, was the minimal sequence required for binding, with the WKY residues essential. Inhibitor studies suggested AT1 is the predominant ANG II receptor. After radioligand binding, under conditions designed to minimize receptor internalization, half the bound U-II was resistant to acid washing suggesting that U-II binds tightly to its receptor in a qusai-irreversible fashion. The AT1 receptor-bound radioligand was completely removed under the same conditions. RT-PCR detected the expression of mRNAs for UT and AT1 receptors. Western blotting showed that U-II and ANG II signaled via ERK1/2 kinase. UT receptor was not lost upon differentiation into myotubes since both mRNA for UT receptor and U-II binding were still present. ANG II receptors were also present as shown by ANG II-induced calcium mobilization. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Synthesis and <i>Ex Vivo</i> Autoradiographic Evaluation of Ethyl-β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1,4′)-2′-deoxy-2′-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluoro-β-D-glucopyranoside-A Novel Radioligand for Lactose-Binding Protein: Implications for Early Detection of Pancreatic Carcinomas with PET	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Fluorine-18; Lactose; HIP/PAP protein; Pancreatic carcinoma; PET	PRIMARY LIVER-CANCER; DUCTAL ADENOCARCINOMA; GENE; INTESTINE; PLASMA; MICE	Previous studies demonstrated that the lactose-binding protein (hepatocellular carcinoma-intestine-pancreas and pancreatitis-associated proteins (HIP/PAP)) is upregulated > 130 times in peritumoral pancreatic tissue as compared to normal pancreatic tissue. Therefore, we developed a new radiolabeled ligand of HIP/PAP, the ethyl-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-(1,4')-2'-deoxy-2'-[F-18]fluoro-beta-d-glucopyranoside (Et-[F-18]FDL) for noninvasive imaging of pancreatic carcinoma using positron emission tomography and computerized tomography (PET/CT). The novel precursor and radiolabeling methods for synthesis of Et-[F-18]FDL produced no isomers; the average decay-corrected radiochemical yield was 68%, radiochemical purity > 99%, and specific activity > 74 GBq/A mu mol. The radioligand properties of Et-[F-18]FDL were evaluated using an ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemistry in pancreatic tissue sections obtained from mice-bearing orthotopic pancreatic tumor xenografts. Et-[F-18]FDL binding to peritumoral pancreatic tissue sections strongly correlated with HIP/PAP expression (r = 0.81) and could be completely blocked by treatment with 1 mM lactose. These results suggest that Et-[F-18]FDL is a promising agent which should be evaluated for detection of early pancreatic carcinomas by PET/CT imaging.

Saturation analysis revealed a single class of high affinity binding sites in the bladder with a K-D value of 45.6 pM and a B-max value of 112 fmol/mg protein. Specific binding was displaced by unlabeled iberiotoxin and penitrem A, but not by blockers of other classes of K+ channels including a-dendrotoxin, margatoxin and apamin. The indole alkaloids, paxilline and verruculogen, significantly increased binding by 4.5- and 4.3-fold, respectively. Tetraacetic acid derivatives such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid enhanced specific [I-125]iberiotoxin-D19Y/Y36F binding about 2.5-fold, which was not attributable to calcium chelation. This increase was due to a significant change in ligand binding affinity (K-D = 6.3 pM), but not due to a change in the B-max, indicating that these compounds may enhance toxin binding via allosteric interactions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the binding sites for [I-125]iberiotoxin-D19Y/Y36F present in the urinary bladder shows a pharmacological profile typical of maxi-K+ channels and can be modulated, not only by previously known indole alkaloids, but also by tetraacetic acid analogs.

Any decline in prostate-specific antigen levels identifies survivors scheduled for prostate-specific membrane antigen-directed radioligand therapy	PROSTATE			English	Article						prostate cancer; PSA response; PSMA I&T; PSMA-617; theranostics	CANCER	Background Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) is increasingly incorporated in the therapeutic algorithm of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We aimed to elucidate the predictive performance of early biochemical response for overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods In this bicentric analysis, we included 184 mCRPC patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA RLT. Response to treatment was defined as decrease in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels 8 weeks after the first cycle of RLT (any decline or >50% according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 3). OS of responders and nonresponders was then compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank comparison. Results A total of 114/184 patients (62.0%) showed any PSA decline (PSA response >50%, 55/184 [29.9%]). For individuals exhibiting a PSA decline >50%, OS of 19 months was significantly longer relative to nonresponders (13 months; hazard ratio of death [HR] = 0.64, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.44-0.93; p = 0.02). However, the difference was even more pronounced for any PSA decline, with an OS of 19 months in responders, but only 8 months in nonresponders (HR = 0.39, 95% CI = 0.25-0.60; p < 0.001). Conclusions In mCRPC patients scheduled for RLT, early biochemical response was tightly linked to prolonged survival, irrespective of the magnitude of PSA decline. As such, even in patients with PSA decrease of less than 50%, RLT should be continued.

However, there are multiple different models to choose from and numerous analytical decisions that must be made when modelling PET data. Therefore, it is important that analysis tools be adapted to the specific circumstances, and that analyses be documented in a transparent manner.Kinfitr, written in the open-source programming language R, is a tool developed for flexible and reproducible kinetic modelling of PET data, i.e. performing all steps using code which can be publicly shared in analysis notebooks. In this study, we compared outcomes obtained usingkinfitrwith those obtained using PMOD: a widely used commercial tool. Results Using previously collected test-retest data obtained with four different radioligands, a total of six different kinetic models were fitted to time-activity curves derived from different brain regions. We observed good correspondence between the two kinetic modelling tools both for binding estimates and for microparameters. Likewise, no substantial differences were observed in the test-retest reliability estimates between the two tools. Conclusions In summary, we showed excellent agreement between the open-source R packagekinfitr, and the widely used commercial application PMOD. We, therefore, conclude thatkinfitris a valid and reliable tool for kinetic modelling of PET data.

PET ligands [<SUP>18</SUP>F]LSN3316612 and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]LSN3316612 quantify <i>O</i>-linked-β-<i>N</i>-acetyl-glucosamine hydrolase in the brain	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DRUG DISCOVERY; FREE-FRACTION; TAU; GLCNACYLATION; RADIOTRACERS; RADIOLIGAND; MONOXIDE; RECEPTOR; BINDING	We aimed to develop effective radioligands for quantifying brain O-linked-beta-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) hydrolase (OGA) using positron emission tomography in living subjects as tools for evaluating drug target engagement. Posttranslational modifications of tau, a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, by O-GlcNAc through the enzyme pair OGA and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) are inversely related to the amounts of its insoluble hyperphosphorylated form. Increase in tau O-GlcNAcylation by OGA inhibition is believed to reduce tau aggregation. LSN3316612, a highly selective and potent OGA ligand [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) = 1.9 nM], emerged as a lead ligand after in silico analysis and in vitro evaluations. [H-3]LSN3316612 imaged and quantified OGA in postmortem brains of rat, monkey, and human. The presence of fluorine and carbonyl functionality in LSN3316612 enabled labeling with positron-emitting fluorine-18 or carbon-11. Both [F-18]LSN3316612 and [C-11]LSN3316612 bound reversibly to OGA in vivo, and such binding was blocked by pharmacological doses of thiamet G, an OGA inhibitor of different chemotype, in monkeys. [F-18]LSN3316612 entered healthy human brain avidly (similar to 4 SUV) without radiodefluorination or adverse effect from other radiometabolites, as evidenced by stable brain total volume of distribution (V-T) values by 110 min of scanning. Overall, [F-18]LSN3316612 is preferred over [C-11]LSN3316612 for future human studies, whereas either may be an effective positron emission tomography radioligand for quantifying brain OGA in rodent and monkey.

Mass dose effects and in vivo affinity in brain PET receptor studies - a study of cerebral 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor binding with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]SB207145	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PET; Injected mass; Mass dose; Occupancy; K-D; Human	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; HUMANS; QUANTIFICATION; RADIOLIGANDS; OCCUPANCY; AGONISTS; DENSITY; LIGAND; IMAGES	Attention to tracer dose principles is crucial in positron emission tomography (PET), and deviations can induce serious errors. In this study, we devise a method for determining receptor occupancy of the mass dose of the radioligand itself and the in vivo affinity. Methods: The approach was used for [C-11]SB207145, a new PET radioligand for imaging the cerebral 5-HT4 receptors in humans. Test-retest PET studies with varying specific activities of [C-11]SB207145 were conducted in seven healthy subjects, and the output parameter regional BPND was modeled. Individual occupancy plots were first computed to estimate the mass dose that saturates 50% of receptors (ID50), and subsequently, the maximal mass dose that can be injected (arbitrarily set at an occupancy <5%) was calculated. Scatchard plots were computed to estimate the in vivo K-D. Results: Increasing the mass dose resulted in a decrease in BPND, whilst the relative cerebellar uptake was unchanged. The ID50 was 85.4 +/- 30.2 mu g, and the upper mass dose limit was 4.5 +/- 1.6 mu g, which does not require ultrahigh specific activity. The estimated in vivo K-D was 2.8 nM (range 1.0-4.8), without any regional differences. Conclusion: The presented method for estimating the upper mass dose limit is suggested as part of validation of PET radioligands. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The collagen-breakdown product <i>N</i>-acetyl-Proline-Glycine-Proline (<i>N</i>-α-PGP) does not interact directly with human CXCR1 and CXCR2	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						N-alpha-PGP (N-acetyl-Proline-Glycine-Proline); CXCR1; CXCR2; Neutrophil; Inflammation	TARGETS; IDENTIFICATION; RECRUITMENT; ANTAGONISTS; CHEMOKINES; RECEPTORS; AGONISTS; CORNEA; BETA	Neutrophils transmigrate from the blood into inflamed tissue via the interaction of chemokines produced in this tissue with chemokine receptors, such as CXCR1 and CXCR2, that are expressed on the membranes of neutrophils. Subsequently, activation of neutrophils will in turn lead to increased tissue damage and thereby enhanced clinical symptoms of inflammatory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis. Besides chemokines. also the collagen-breakdown product Nacetyl-Proline-Glycine-Proline (N-alpha-PGP) attracts neutrophils. In a recent article (Weathington et al., 2006) it was suggested that N-alpha-PGP exerts its effect via CXCR1 and CXCR2. In this study, we show that N-alpha-PGP, in contrast to CXCL8, does not directly activate or interact with CXCR1 or CXCR2. N-alpha-PGP was not able to displace the radioligand [I-125]CXCL8 from CXCR1 and CXCR2 expressing HEK293T cells or neutrophils. In addition, N-alpha-PGP did not displace the radioligand [H-3]-SB265610, a CXCR2 antagonist, from CXCR2 expressing cells. Furthermore. N-alpha-PGP was not able to activate G protein signalling in cells expressing CXCR1 and CXCR2. N-alpha-PGP was also not able to recruit beta-arrestin2, an intracellular scaffolding protein involved in G protein-independent signalling, in cells expressing CXCR2. These studies indicate that N-alpha-PGP is not a ligand of CXCR1 or CXCR2. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Chalcone-inspired <i>r</i>A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor ligands: Ring closure as an alternative to a reactive substructure	CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN			English	Article						adenosine A(1); A(2A) receptor antagonist; cyanopyridine; heterocycle; Parkinson's disease; ring closure	ONE-POT SYNTHESIS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DRUG DISCOVERY; SOLVENT-FREE; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; SCREENING LIBRARIES; A(1); CATALYST; RAT; DERIVATIVES	Over the past few years, great progress has been made in the development of high-affinity adenosine A(1) and/or A(2A) receptor antagonists-promising agents for the potential treatment of Parkinson's disease. Unfortunately, many of these compounds raise structure-related concerns. The present study investigated the effect of ring closures on the rA(1)/A(2A) affinity of compounds containing a highly reactive alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl system, hence providing insight into the potential of heterocycles to address these concerns. A total of 12 heterocyclic compounds were synthesised and evaluated in silico and in vitro. The test compounds performed well upon qualitative assessment of drug-likeness and were generally found to be free from potentially problematic fragments. Most also showed low/weak cytotoxicity. Results from radioligand binding experiments confirm that heterocycles (particularly 2-substituted 3-cyanopyridines) can replace the promiscuous alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone functional group without compromising A(1)/A(2A) affinity. Structure-activity relationships highlighted the importance of hydrogen bonds in binding to the receptors of interest. Compounds 3c (rA(1)K(i) = 16 nM; rA(2A)K(i) = 65 nM) and 8a (rA(1)K(i) = 102 nM; rA(2A)K(i) = 37 nM), which both act as A(1) antagonists, showed significant dual A(1)/A(2A) affinity and may, therefore, inspire further investigation into heterocycles as potentially safe and potent adenosine receptor antagonists.

Microglia Activation in Basal Ganglia Is a Late Event in Huntington Disease Pathophysiology	NEUROLOGY-NEUROIMMUNOLOGY & NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article							PROTEIN 18 KDA; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; HUMAN MONOCYTES; HUMAN BRAIN; POLYMORPHISM; SENSITIVITY; REGION; CELLS	Objective To define the role played by microglia in different stages of Huntington disease (HD), we used the TSPO radioligand [11C]-ER176 and PET to evaluate microglial activation in relation to neurodegeneration and in relation to the clinical features seen at premanifest and manifest stages of the disease. Methods This is a cross-sectional study in which 18 subjects (6 controls, 6 premanifest, and 6 manifest HD gene carriers) underwent a [11C]-ER176 PET scan and an MRI for anatomic localization. Segmentation of regions of interest (ROIs) was performed, and group differences in [11C]-ER176 binding (used to evaluate the extent of microglial activation) were assessed by the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Microglial activation was correlated with ROIs volumes, disease burden, and the scores obtained in the clinical scales. As an exploratory aim, we evaluated the dynamic functions of microglia in vitro, by using induced microglia-like (iMG) cells from peripheral blood monocytes. Results Individuals with manifest HD present higher [11C]-ER176 SUVR in both globi pallidi and putamina in comparison with controls. No differences were observed when we compared premanifest HD with controls or with manifest HD. We also found a significant correlation between increased microglial activation and cumulative disease burden, and with reduced volumes. iMG from controls, premanifest HD, and manifest HD patients showed similar phagocytic capacity. Conclusions Altogether, our data demonstrate that microglial activation is involved in HD pathophysiology and is associated with disease progression.

Rapid conjugation with the prosthetic group takes place in microwave-assisted click conjugation under mild conditions. Thus, a bivalent homodimeric SiX-dipropargyl glycerol derivatized radioligand, [F-18]BMPPSiF, with enhanced affinity was developed by using click conjugation. High uptake of the radioligand was demonstrated in 5-HT1A receptor-rich regions in the brain with positron emission tomography. Molecular docking studies (rigid protein-flexible ligand) of BMPPSiF and known antagonists (WAY-100635, MPPF, and MefWAY) with monomeric, dimeric, and multimeric 5-HT1A receptor models were performed, with the highest G score obtained for docked BMPPSiF: -6.766 as compared with all three antagonists on the monomeric model. Multimeric induced-fit docking was also performed to visualize the comparable mode of binding under in vivo conditions, and a notably improved G score of -8.455 was observed for BMPPSiF. These data directly correlate the high binding potential of BMPPSiF with the bivalent binding mode obtained in the biological studies. The present study warrants wide application of the SiX-dipropargyl glycerol prosthetic group in the development of ligands for imaging with enhanced affinity markers for specific targeting based on peptides, nucleosides, and lipids.

In order to study these receptors in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET), there is an increasing interest for subtype selective and high affinity radioligands. Up to now, no optimal radiotracer is available. Thus, 1-(2,4-difluorophenethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenylsulfonyl)piperidine (9), possessing high affinity and sufficient subtype selectivity for 5-HT2A receptors, and 1-(2,4-difluorophenethyl)-4-(4-fluorophenylsulfinyl)piperidine (15) have been F-18-labelled by a nucleophilic one-step reaction. Both radiotracers could be prepared and isolated within 45 min, [F-18]9 in a radiochemical yield (RCY) of 34.5 +/- 8% and [F-18]5 of 9.5 +/- 2.5%. The K-i values of 9 and 15 at 5-HT2A receptors towards [H-3]ketanserin were determined to be 1.9 +/- 0.6 and 198 +/- 8 nM, respectively. Autoradiography with [F-18]9 and [F-18]15 on rat brain sections showed a very high nonspecific binding of >80% for [F-18]9 and 30% to 40% nonspecific binding for [F-18]15; however, it is still too high in order to compensate for its lower affinity. Even though the affinity of 9 is more promising compared with 15, the high nonspecific binding of both radiofluorinated tracers in rat brain does not recommend those as an in vivo PET imaging agent for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in humans.

The presence of Ca2+ was found to be mandatory to achieve specific [I-125]NDP-MSH binding to the melanocortin receptors. Although association kinetics of [I-125]NDP-MSH followed the regularities of simple bimolecular reactions, the dissociation of [I-125]NDP-MSH from the melanocortin receptors was heterogeneous. Eleven linear and cyclic MSH peptides studied displaced the [I-125]NDP-MSH binding to the studied melanocortin receptors, with the shapes of their competition curves varying from biphasic or shallow to super-steep (Hill coefficients ranging from 0.4 to 1.5). Notably the same peptide often gave highly different patterns on different melanocortin receptor subtypes; e.g. the MC4 receptor selective antagonist HS131 gave a Hill coefficient of 1.5 on the MC1 receptor but 0.5-0.7 on the MC3-5 receptors. Adding a mask of one of the peptides to block its high affinity binding did not prevent other competing peptides to yield biphasic competition curves. The data indicate that the binding of MSH peptides to melanocortin receptors are governed by a complex dynamic homotropic co-operative regulations. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Objective: To seek a correlation between anti-titin antibodies and other features of MG patients, including histopathology, age at diagnosis, anti-acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR), autoantibody titers, and clinical severity. Methods: A novel, highly specific radioligand assay was performed on a large group of 398 patients with generalized MG. Results: Among thymectomized patients, anti-titin antibodies were present in most patients with thymoma (56/70 [80%]), contrasting with only a minority of patients with thymus atrophy or hyperplasia (17/165 [10%]). They were also present in 64 (41%) of 155 nonthymectomized patients who had a radiologically normal thymus. In these patients and in those who had a histologically normal thymus, anti-titin antibodies were associated with a later age at onset of disease and with intermediate titers of anti-AChR antibodies. After controlling for these 2 variables, disease severity was not significantly influenced by anti-titin antibodies. Conclusions: Anti-titin antibodies are a sensitive marker of thymoma associated with MG in patients 60 years and younger, justifying the insistent search for a thymoma in MG patients of this age group who have these antibodies. In nonthymoma patients, anti-titin antibodies represent an interesting marker complementary to the anti-AChR antibody titer, identifying a restricted subset of patients. These clinical correlations should prompt further studies to examine the mechanisms leading to the production of anti-titin antibodies.

Automated reference region extraction and population-based input function for brain [<SUP>11</SUP>C]TMSX PET image analyses	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						A(2A)R; input function; PET; supervised clustering; [C-11]TMSX	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ADENOSINE A(2A) RECEPTORS; PROGRESSIVE MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DIAGNOSTIC-CRITERIA; A2A RECEPTORS; RAT; RADIOLIGAND; BINDING	[C-11]TMSX ([7-N-methyl-C-11]-(E)-8-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)-1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is a selective adenosine A2A receptor (A(2A)R) radioligand. In the central nervous system (CNS), A(2A)R are linked to dopamine D-2 receptor function in striatum, but they are also important modulators of inflammation. The golden standard for kinetic modeling of brain [C-11]TMSX positron emission tomography (PET) is to obtain arterial input function via arterial blood sampling. However, this method is laborious, prone to errors and unpleasant for study subjects. The aim of this work was to evaluate alternative input function acquisition methods for brain [C-11]TMSX PET imaging. First, a noninvasive, automated method for the extraction of gray matter reference region using supervised clustering (SCgm) was developed. Second, a method for obtaining a population-based arterial input function (PBIF) was implemented. These methods were created using data from 28 study subjects (7 healthy controls, 12 multiple sclerosis patients, and 9 patients with Parkinson's disease). The results with PBIF correlated well with original plasma input, and the SCgm yielded similar results compared with cerebellum as a reference region. The clustering method for extracting reference region and the population-based approach for acquiring input for dynamic [C-11]TMSX brain PET image analyses appear to be feasible and robust methods, that can be applied in patients with CNS pathology.

Furthermore, type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) antagonism is evaluated as antismoking therapy, and nicotine usage can be an important confound in positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of the CB1R. We evaluated CB1R binding in the rat brain using the PET radioligand [F-18]MK-9470 after chronic administration of nicotine. Twelve female Wistar rats were scanned at baseline and after chronic administration of either nicotine (1 mg/kg; 2 weeks daily intraperitoneal (IP)) or saline as control. In vivo micro-PET images of CB1R binding were anatomically standardized and analyzed by voxel-based statistical parametric mapping and a predefined volume-of-interest approach. We did not observe changes in [F-18]MK-9470 binding (p (height) < 0.001 level; uncorrected) on a group basis in either condition. Only at a less stringent threshold of p (height) < 0.005 (uncorrected) was a modest increase observed in tracer binding in the cerebellum for nicotine (peak voxel value + 6.8%, p (cluster) = 0.002 corrected). In conclusion, chronic IP administration of nicotine does not produce major cerebral changes in CB1R binding of [F-18]MK-9470 in the rat. These results also suggest that chronic nicotine usage is unlikely to interfere with human PET imaging using this radioligand.

Competitive mass spectrometry binding assay for characterization of three binding sites of tubulin	JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article						MS binding; colchicine; vinblastine; paclitaxel; tubulin	HUMAN PLASMA; DRUG DISCOVERY; COLCHICINE; AFFINITY; POLYMERIZATION; RECEPTORS; QUANTIFICATION; VINBLASTINE; INHIBITION; MECHANISM	Tubulin is an attractive and established target for anticancer therapy. To date, the only method to determine the binding of inhibitor to tubulin has been competitive radioligand binding assays. We developed a non-radioactive mass spectrometry (MS) binding assay to study the tubulin binding of colchicine, vinblastine and paclitaxel and to identify which of these three binding sites that a novel inhibitor binds. The method involves a very simple step of separating the unbound ligand from macromolecules using ultrafiltration. The unbound ligand in the filtrate can be accurately determined using highly sensitive and specific liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The assay was validated using podophyllotoxin, vincristine and docetaxel, drugs that compete to the colchicine-, vinblastine- and paclitaxel-binding sites in tubulin, respectively. This competitive binding assay allowed the reliable detection of interactions of these drugs with three binding sites on tubulin. This method was subsequently applied to determine the tubulin-binding site of 4-substituted methoxylbenzoyl-aryl-thiazoles (SMART-H), a potent antitubulin agent developed in our laboratory. The results indicated that SMART-H specifically and reversibly bound only to the colchicine-binding site, but not to vinblastine- or paclitaxel sites. This new non-radioligand binding method to determine the binding site on tubulin will function as a useful tool to study the binding sites of tubulin inhibitors.

Optimizing the Expression of Human Dopamine Receptors in <i>Escherichia coli</i>	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						human dopamine receptors; expression in E; coli; GPCR; protein engineering; FACS; radioligand binding; fluorescent ligand; gene library	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; RAT NEUROTENSIN RECEPTOR; DIRECTED EVOLUTION; BINDING; D-3; PURIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; DYNAMICS; LIGANDS; COMPLEX	The human dopamine receptors D-2S and D-3 belong to the group of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and are important drug targets. Structural analyses and development of new receptor subtype specific drugs have been impeded by low expression yields or receptor instability. Fusing the T4 lysozyme into the intracellular loop 3 improves crystallization but complicates conformational studies. To circumvent these problems, we expressed the human D-2S and D-3 receptors in Escherichia coli using different N- and C-terminal fusion proteins and thermostabilizing mutations. We optimized expression times and used radioligand binding assays with whole cells and membrane homogenates to evaluate K-D-values and the number of receptors in the cell membrane. We show that the presence but not the type of a C-terminal fusion protein is important. Bacteria expressing receptors capable of ligand binding can be selected using FACS analysis and a fluorescently labeled ligand. Improved receptor variants can thus be generated using error-prone PCR. Subsequent analysis of clones showed the distribution of mutations over the whole gene. Repeated cycles of PCR and FACS can be applied for selecting highly expressing receptor variants with high affinity ligand binding, which in the future can be used for analytical studies.

The CT attenuation units (Hounsfield units) correlated with the prostate primary in the case of direct tumor extension from the prostate, whereas in hematogenous metastatic seeding the Hounsfield units were lower than in the primary prostatic tumor. A favorable outcome to Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT was observed in patients with low or no baseline F-18-FDG uptake despite a high Gleason score and a high-risk National Comprehensive Cancer Network prognostic category and did not correlate with the latter alone, whereas a high SUVmax on F-18-FDG PET/CT was associated with an adverse outcome. These findings suggest a promising role for F-18-FDG PET/CT in predicting therapeutic outcomes more confidently, and hence the concept of dual-tracer PET appears to hold good in prostate adenocarcinoma theranostics.

The medications include androgen signaling inhibitors, chemotherapy, Ra-223, and sipuleucel-T. Most patients treated with these agents will still develop primary or secondary resistance against any given drug. The (177)Lutetium-PSMA radioligand therapy (Lu-177-PSMA-RLT) represents a good reserve option and can be used within compassionate use provisions demonstrating promising efficacy in the majority of patients in Germany. Objectives Establishment of status quo of Lu-177-PSMA-RLT in mCRPC in 2020. Materials and methods Presentation of the therapy landscape in mCRPC and the current evidence on Lu-177-PSMA-RLT after PubMed based literature search. Results Several larger retrospective studies and the first prospective trials on Lu-177-PSMA-RLT show premature but encouraging evidence on Lu-177-PSMA-RLT to be a promising new option in mCRPC patients. The toxicity profile seems to be favorable. The phase III trial VISION aims to provide evidence for the approval of Lu-177-PSMA-RLT in combination with abiraterone or enzalutamide in patients having been pretreated with enzalutamide or abiraterone and docetaxel. Conclusions Despite the promising preliminary results of Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, the efficacy results of VISION need to be awaited prior to using the therapy outside of compassionate use provisions.

This study investigated the correlation between neuroinflammation and S1PR1 expression in the spinal cord of an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model of MS, using the S1PR1 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [C-11]TZ3321. MicroPET imaging studies of [C-11]TZ3321 were performed to measure uptake of [C-11]TZ3321 in the spinal cord of EAE rats. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to confirm the overexpression of S1PR1 and other inflammatory biomarkers. MicroPET imaging demonstrated a 20-30 % increase in [C-11]TZ3321 uptake in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats versus sham controls at 35-60 min post injection. The increased uptake of [C-11]TZ3321 was correlated with the overexpression of S1PR1 in the lumbar spinal cord of EAE rats that was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. Upregulated S1PR1 expression was associated with glial cell activation and immune cell infiltration. MicroPET imaging modality with a specific radioligand [C-11]TZ3321 is able to assess the expression of S1PR1 in EAE rat lumbar spinal cord. This may provide a new approach to the assessment of neuroinflammatory response in MS and other inflammatory diseases.

High-Affinity, Non-Nucleotide-Derived Competitive Antagonists of Platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> Receptors	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ADP-RECEPTOR; P2-RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; ACTIVE METABOLITE; DERIVATIVES; IDENTIFICATION; ADENOSINE; PHARMACOLOGY; AGGREGATION; INHIBITORS	Anthraquinone derivatives related to the moderately potent, nonselective P2Y(12) receptor antagonist reactive blue 2 (6) have been synthesized and optimized with respect to P2Y(12) receptor affinity. A radioligand binding assay utilizing human blood platelet membranes and the P2Y(12) receptor-selective antagonist radioligand [H-3]2-propylthioadenosine-5'-adenylic acid (1,1-dichloro-1-phosphonomethyl-1-phosphonyl) anhydride ([H-3]PSB-0413) was applied for compound testing. 1-Amino-2-sulfoanthraquinone derivatives bearing a (p-phenylamino)anilino substitution in the 4-position and an additional acidic function in the meta-position of the aniline ring showed high P2Y(12) receptor affinity. These new anthraquinone derivatives became accessible by a recently developed copper(0)-catalyzed Ullmann coupling reaction of 1-amino-4-bromoanthraquinone derivatives with anilines in phosphate buffer under microwave irradiation. The most potent compounds exhibited K-i values of 24.9 nM (1-amino-4-[4-phenylamino-3-sulfophenylamino]-9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2-sulfonate, PSB-0739, 39), and 2 1.0 nM (1-amino-4-[4-phenylamino-3-carboxyphenylamino]- 9,10-dioxo-9,10-dihydroanthracene-2-sulfonate, PSB-0702, 41), respectively. 1-Amino-2-sulfo-4-anilinoanthraquinone derivatives appeared to be noncytotoxic, as shown for selected derivatives at two human cell lines (melanoma and astrocytoma). Compounds 39 and 41 represent new lead structures for the development of antithrombotic drugs.

Validation of the reference tissue model for estimation of dopaminergic D<sub>2</sub>-like receptor binding with [<SUP>18</SUP>F](<i>N</i>-methyl)benperidol in humans	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						[F-18]NMB; graphical method	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN-BRAIN; F-18 (N-METHYL)BENPERIDOL; AUTOMATED ALGORITHM; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; BLOOD-VOLUME; PET TRACER; INVIVO	Positron emission tomography measurements of dopaminergic D-2-like receptors may provide important insights into disorders such as Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, dystonia and Tourette's syndrome. The positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [F-18](N-methyl) benperidol ([F-18]NMB) has high affinity and selectivity for D-2-like receptors and is not displaced by endogenous dopamine. The goal of this study is to evaluate the use of a graphical method utilizing a reference tissue region for [F-18]-NMB PET analysis by comparisons to an explicit three-compartment tracer kinetic model and graphical method that use arterial blood measurements. We estimated binding potential (BP) in the caudate and putamen using all three methods in 16 humans and found that the three-compartment tracer kinetic method provided the highest BP estimates while the graphical method using a reference region yielded the lowest estimates (P<.0001 by repeated-measures ANOVA). However, the three methods yielded highly correlated BP estimates for the two regions of interest. We conclude that the graphical method using a reference region still provides a useful estimate of BP comparable to methods using arterial blood sampling, especially since the reference region method is less invasive and computationally more straightforward, thereby simplifying these measurements.

The N-methylated derivative of JDTic (named MeJDTic), which has been recently described as a potent and selective antagonist of kappa-opioid receptor in vitro, was labeled with carbon-11 and evaluated for in vivo imaging the kappa-opioid receptor in mice. Methods: [C-11]-MeJDTic was prepared by methylation of JDTic with [C-11]-methyl triflate. The binding of [C-11]-MeJDTic to kappa-opioid receptor was investigated ex vivo by biodistribution and competition studies using nonfasted inale CD1 mice. Results: [C-11]-MeJDTic exhibited a high and rapid distribution in peripheral organs. The uptake was maximal in lung where the kappa receptor is largely expressed. [C-11]-MeJDTic rapidly crossed the blood-brain barrier and accumulated in the brain regions of interest (hypothalamus). The parent ligand remained the major radioactive compound in brain during the experiment. Chase studies with U50,488 (a kappa referring agonist), morphine (a mu agonist) and naltrindole (a delta antagonist) demonstrated that this uptake was the result of specific binding to the kappa-opioid receptor. Conclusion: These findings suggested that [C-11]-MeJDTic appeared to be a promising selective "lead" radioligand for kappa-opioid receptor PET imaging. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Endogenous heptapeptide Met-enkephalin-Gly-Tyr binds differentially to duplicate delta opioid receptors from zebrafish	PEPTIDES			English	Article						Met-enkephalin-Gly-Tyr; peptide analogues; delta opioid receptor; radioligand binding; [S-35]GTP gamma S; zebrafish	DANIO-RERIO; LEU-ENKEPHALIN; MU-RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; CLONING; PEPTIDE; SITES; MET-ENKEPHALIN-ARG(6)-PHE(7); PROENKEPHALIN; NEUROPEPTIDE	Met-enkephalin-Gly-Tyr (MEGY) is an endogenous peptide that binds to opioid sites in zebrafish and in rat brain homogenates. The aim of this work is to characterize the binding profile of this opioid ligand on two duplicate delta receptors from zebrafish, ZFOR1 and ZFOR4. Our results show that, while ZFOR1 presents one single binding site for [H-3]-MEGY (K-D = 4.0 +/- 0.4 nM), the experimental data from ZFOR4 fit better to the two-site binding model (K-D1 = 0.8 +/- 0.2 nM and K-D2 = 30.2 +/- 10.2 nM). Two other MEGY synthetic analogues, (D-Ala(2))-MEGY and (D-Ala(2), Val(5))-MEGY were also prepared and tested, together with the original peptide MEGY and other opioid ligands, in competition binding assays. While these peptides presented K-i values on the nanomolar range when using [H-3]-MEGY as radioligand, these parameters were two orders higher in competition binding assays with the antagonist [H-3]-diprenorphine. Functional [S-35]GTP gamma S stimulation analysis has revealed that these two receptors can be activated by several opioid agonists. Our results prove that although the MEGY peptide acts as an agonist on ZFOR1 and ZFOR4, there are subtle pharmacological differences between these two delta opioid receptors from zebrafish.

Methods: Subsequent to baseline quantifications of D-2 receptor binding, imaging studies were performed on the same animals after pre-treatment with haloperidol and methylphenidate, which block D-2 receptors and dopamine transporters, respectively. Results: Striatal baseline equilibrium ratios (V-3 '') of [I-123]iodobenzamide binding were 1.42 +/- 0.31 (mean +/- SD). After pre-treatment with haloperidol and methylphenidate, V-3 '' values decreased to 0.54 +/- 0.46 (p < 0.0001) and 0.98 +/- 0.48 (p=0.009), respectively. Conclusion: The decrease in [I-123]iodobenzamide binding induced by pre-treatment with haloperidol reflects D-2 receptor blockade, whereas the decrease in receptor binding induced by pre-treatment with methylphenidate can be interpreted in terms of competition between [I-123]IBZM and endogenous dopamine. Findings show that multiple in vivo measurements of [I-123]iodobenzamide binding to D-2 receptors in competition with exogenous and endogenous ligands are feasible in the same animal. This may be of future relevance for the in vivo evaluation of novel radioligands as well as for studying the interrelations between pre- and/or postsynaptic radioligand binding and different levels of endogenous dopamine.

Our data, based on [I-125]-SDF-1 alpha radioligand binding, SDF-1 alpha -induced [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding and use of specific CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 reveals the complex nature of SDF-1 alpha -CXCR4 interaction. Firstly, homologous competition with cold SDF-1 alpha revealed a bimodal ligand displacement curve and secondly, although AMD3100 inhibited both SDF-1 alpha -mediated chemotaxis (IC50=4.7 nM) and [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding (IC50=7.4 nM) with high affinity, it was intriguingly upto 3000-fold less potent (IC50 = 15.2 muM) in the radioligand binding assay. These results provide pharmacological evidence for the recently described two-site model for SDF-1 alpha -CXCR4 interaction. Accordingly, inhibition of SDF-l alpha binding to one of the receptor sites is sufficient to antagonize function, without causing its complete displacement from the receptor. Furthermore, these findings have important implications in the development and evaluation or CXCR4-selective small molecule antagonists for therapeutic use. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

J	Belz, GG				Belz, GG			Pharmacological differences among angiotensin II receptor antagonists	BLOOD PRESSURE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th European Meeting on Hypertension (ESH)	MAY 29, 2000	GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN			aldosterone; angiotensin II receptor antagonists; candesartan; irbesartan; radioligand receptor assay; renin-angiotensin system	BLOCKADE; CANDESARTAN; IRBESARTAN; VALSARTAN; LOSARTAN; EFFICACY	Angiotensin II ATI receptor antagonists (AIIRAs) have demonstrated efficacy similar to other classes of antihypertensive agents as well as "placebo-level" tolerability at all doses. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies provide a framework for understanding important intra-class dissimilarities. Disparity in antagonistic effects may be determined by in vivo responses to challenges of exogenous angiotensin II (Ang II) and by ex vivo/in vitro responses to a drug's biological activity by radioligand receptor assay (RRA). Two independent studies have been conducted in which irbesartan exhibited a more pronounced and longer-lasting antagonism to the effects of exogenous Ang II than losartan and valsartan. Comparative trials have indicated that both irbesartan and candesartan show greater clinical efficacy in lowering blood pressure than losartan. Recently, we have compared the Ang II antagonistic properties of irbesartan 150 mg/day and candesartan 8 mg/day. Both drugs block AT(1) receptors with "insurmountable" antagonism and demonstrate a long duration of action. While both irbesartan and candesartan showed a similar degree of antagonistic activity in vivo, distinctly higher antagonistic activity in plasma was found for irbesartan by RRA at all time-points. Furthermore, plasma renin activity during periods with high antagonistic activity was significantly higher, and aldosterone levels following Ang II stimulation were blunted to a greater extent, following administration of irbesartan. In summary, in the doses tested, irbesartan exhibits the strongest antagonism when compared with losartan, valsartan and candesartan. This finding may have clinical implications.

Candidate 3-benzazepine-1-ol type GluN2B receptor radioligands (<SUP>11</SUP>C-NR2B-Me enantiomers) have high binding in cerebellum but not to σ1 receptors	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						GluN2B; NMDA receptor; sigma 1 receptor; NR2B-Me; PET	NMDA RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; NR2B SUBUNIT; CHANNELS; EXPRESSION; LIGANDS; POTENT; ANTAGONISM; MODULATION; PLASTICITY	Introduction We recently reported C-11-NR2B-SMe ([S-methyl-C-11](R,S)-7-thiomethoxy-3-(4-(4-methyl-phenyl)butyl)2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-1-ol) and its enantiomers as candidate radioligands for imaging the GluN2B subunit within rat N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. However, these radioligands gave unexpectedly high and displaceable binding in rat cerebellum, possibly due to cross-reactivity with sigma-1 (sigma 1) receptors. This study investigated C-11-labeled enantiomers of a close analogue (7-methoxy-3-(4-(p-tolyl)butyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d] azepin-1-ol; NR2B-Me) of C-11-NR2B-SMe as new candidate GluN2B radioligands. PET was used to evaluate these radioligands in rats and to assess potential cross-reactivity to sigma 1 receptors. Methods NR2B-Me was assayed for binding affinity and selectivity to GluN2B in vitro. C-11-NR2B-Me and its enantiomers were prepared by Pd-mediated treatment of boronic ester precursors with C-11-iodomethane. Brain PET scans were conducted after radioligand intravenous injection into rats. Various ligands for GluN2B receptors or sigma 1 receptors were administered at set doses in pre-blocking or displacement experiments to assess their impact on imaging data. 18FFTC146 and enantiomers of C-11-NR2B-SMe were used for comparison. Radiometabolites from brain and plasma were measured ex vivo and in vitro. Results NR2B-Me enantiomers showed high GluN2B affinity and selectivity in vitro. C-11-NR2B-Me enantiomers gave high early whole rat brain uptake of radioactivity, including high uptake in cerebellum, followed by slower decline. Radioactivity in brain at 30 min ex vivo was virtually all unchanged radioligand. Only less lipophilic radiometabolites appeared in plasma. When C-11-(R)-NR2B-Me was used, three high-affinity GluN2B ligands-NR2B-SMe, Ro25-6981, and CO101,244-showed increasing pre-block of whole brain radioactivity retention with increasing dose. Two s1 receptor antagonists, FTC146 and BD1407, were ineffective pre-blocking agents. Together, these results strongly resemble those obtained with C-11-NR2B-SMe enantiomers, except that C-11-NR2B-Me enantiomers showed faster reversibility of binding. When F-18-FTC146 was used as a radioligand, FTC146 and BD1407 showed strong pre-blocking effects whereas GluN2B ligands showed only weak blocking effects.

One way to broaden the therapeutic index could be to administer higher doses in combination with radioprotectors, since administered radioactivity is kept low today in order to avoid side-effects from a high absorbed dose to healthy tissue. Here, we investigated the human radical scavenger alpha(1)-microglobulin (A1M) together with 177-Lutetium (Lu-177) labeled PSMA-617 in preclinical models with respect to therapeutic efficacy and kidney toxicity. Nude mice with subcutaneous LNCaP xenografts were injected with 50 or 100 MBq of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, with or without injections of recombinant A1M (rA1M) (at T = 0 and T = 24 h). Kidney absorbed dose was calculated to 7.36 Gy at 4 days post a 100 MBq injection. Activity distribution was imaged with Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) at 24 h. Tumor volumes were measured continuously, and kidneys and blood were collected at termination (3-4 days and 3-4 weeks after injections). In a parallel set of experiments, mice were given [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and rA1M as above and dynamic technetium-99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine ([Tc-99m-MAG3) SPECT imaging was performed prior to injection, and 3- and 6-months post injection. Blood and urine were continuously sampled. At termination (6 months) the kidneys were resected. Biomarkers of kidney function, expression of stress genes and kidney histopathology were analyzed. [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 uptake, in tumors and kidneys, as well as treatment efficacy did not differ between rA1M and vehicle groups. In mice given rA1M, [Tc-99m]Tc-MAG3 imaging revealed a significantly higher slope of initial uptake at three months compared to mice co-injected with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and vehicle. Little or no change compared to control was seen in urine albumin, serum/plasma urea levels, RT-qPCR analysis of stress response genes and in the kidney histopathological evaluation. In conclusion, [Tc-99m]Tc-MAG3 imaging presented itself as a sensitive tool to detect changes in kidney function revealing that administration of rA1M has a potentially positive effect on kidney perfusion and tubular function when combined with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. Furthermore, we could show that rA1M did not affect anti-PSMA radioligand therapy efficacy.

Design and Investigation of a [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-Labeled Benzamide Derivative as a High Affinity Dual Sigma Receptor Subtype Radioligand for Prostate Tumor Imaging	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						sigma receptors; positron emission tomography; PC-3 tumors; prostate cancer	THERAPEUTIC DRUGS; PEPTIDE RECEPTOR; PGRMC1 PROTEIN; PET PROBE; LIGAND; ANALOGS; ANTAGONIST; COMPLEXES; DOSIMETRY; DISCOVERY	High overexpression of sigma (sigma) receptors (sigma 1 and sigma 2 subtypes) in a variety of human solid tumors has prompted the development of sigma receptor-targeting radioligands, as imaging for tumor detection. A majority of these radioligands to date target the sigma 2 receptor, a potential marker of tumor proliferative status. The identification of approximately equal proportions of both sigma receptor subtypes in prostate tumors suggests that a high affinity, dual sigma receptor targeting radioligand could potentially provide enhanced tumor targeting efficacy in prostate cancer. To accomplish this goal, we designed a series of ligands which bind to both sigma receptor subtypes with high affinity. Ligand 3a in this series, displaying optimal dual a receptor subtype affinity (sigma 1, 6.3 nM; sigma 2, 10.2 nM) was radiolabeled with fluorine-8 (F-18) to give [F-18]3a and evaluated as a sigma receptor-targeting radioligand in the mouse PC-3 prostate tumor model. Cellular assays with PC-3 cells demonstrated that a major proportion of [F-18]3a was localized to cell surface sigma receptors, while similar to 10% of [F-18]3a was internalized within cells after incubation for 3.5 h. Serial PET imaging in mice bearing PC-3 tumors revealed that uptake of [F-18]3a was 1.6 +/- 0.8, 4.4 +/- 0.3, and 3.6 +/- 0.6% ID/g (% injection dose per gram) in sigma receptor-positive prostate tumors at 15 min, 1.5 h, and 3.5 h-postinjection, respectively (n = 3) resulting in clear tumor visualization. Blocking studies conducted with haloperidol (a nonselective inhibitor for both sigma receptor subtypes) confirmed that the uptake of [F-18]3a was a receptor-mediated. Histology analysis confirmed similar expression of sigma 1 and sigma 2 in PC-3 tumors which was significantly greater than its expression in normal organs/tissues such as liver, kidney, and muscle. Metabolite studies revealed that >50% of radioactivity in PC-3 tumors at 30 min postinjection represented intact [F-18]3a. Prominent sigma receptor specific uptake of [F-18]3a in prostate tumors and its subsequent clear visualization with PET imaging indicate potential utility for the diagnosis of prostate carcinoma.

As radioligands, we used the adenosine A(1)-receptor ligand [H-3]-cyclopentyl-dipropylxanthine (CPX), the alpha (1)-adrenoceptor ligand [H-3]-prazosin (PRAZ), and the beta -adrenoceptor ligand (-)-[I-125]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Allosteric actions on ligand dissociation and the equilibrium binding were measured in the membrane fractions of rat whole forebrain (CPX) and of rat cardiac left ventricle (PRAZ, ICYP, NMS), respectively. 3 CPX and PRAZ showed a monophasic dissociation with half-lives of 5.88 +/- 0.15 and 12.27 +/- 0.46 min, respectively. In the case of CPX, neither the binding at equilibrium nor the dissociation characteristics were influenced by the allosteric agents. With PRAZ, the binding at equilibrium remained almost unaltered in the presence of W84, whereas it was reduced to 36 +/- 2% of the control value with alcuronium and to 42 +/- 2% with gallamine. The dissociation of PRAZ was not affected by W84, whereas it was moderately accelerated by alcuronium and gallamine. In the case of ICYP, the binding at equilibrium was not affected by the allosteric modulators. The dissociation of ICYP was slow, and after 3 h, more than 50% of the radioligand was still bound, so that a reliable half-life could not be calculated. ICYP dissociation was not affected by W84. In the presence of alcuronium and gallamine, the dissociation curve of ICYP revealed an initial drop from the starting level, followed by the major phase of dissociation being parallel to the control curve. 4 In summary, the allosteric action of the applied agents is not a common feature of G-protein-coupled receptors and appears to be specific for muscarinic receptors.

A radioligand binding assay with [I-125]CYP was used to measure beta-adrenoceptor binding activity in rat tissues. Metoprolol exhibited the highest affinity to specific binding sites of [I-125]CYP in the rat heart, indicating the dominance of beta(1)-adrenoceptors. beta(3)-selective agonists (BRL37344 and CL316243) and antagonist (SR59230A) exhibited higher affinity to specific binding sites of [I-125]CYP in the bladder than in the heart and lungs. Furthermore, the binding affinity of the beta(2)-selective antagonist, ICI118551 was the highest in the bladder. The B-max of specific [(125)] CYP binding in the bladder was significantly lower in WKY and SHR than in Wistar rats. The present study provides further evidence for the coexistence of beta(2)-and beta(3)-adrenoceptors in the rat bladder, and indicates that beta-adrenoceptor density is lower in the bladders of WKY and SHR.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical, renal, and salivary scintigraphy data and salivary [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 ligand PET scan measures such as metabolic volume and SUVmax values of 27 mCRPC men (mean age 71 +/- 7 years) before and 4 weeks after receiving three cycles of PSMA-RLT every 4 weeks. Twenty-two patients additionally obtained renal and salivary scintigraphy prior to each cycle. A one-way ANOVA, post-hoc Scheffe test and Cochran's Q test were applied to assess organ toxicity. Results: In total, 54 PSMA PET scans, 98 kidney, and 98 salivary scintigraphy results were evaluated. There were no significant differences for the ejection fraction, peak time, and residual activity after 5 min for both parotid and submandibular glands prior to each cycle and 4 weeks after the last cycle. Similarly, no significant differences in serum creatinine and renal scintigraphy parameters were observed prior to each cycle and 4 weeks after the last treatment. Despite there being no changes in the metabolic volume of both submandibular glands, SUVmax values dropped significantly (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Results evidenced no alterations in renal function and only minimal impairment of salivary function of mCRPC patients who acquired an intense PSMA-RLT regimen every 4 weeks.

Imaging of atherosclerosis, targeting LFA-1 on inflammatory cells with <SUP>111</SUP>In-DANBIRT	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY			English	Article						Atherosclerosis; inflammation; SPECT; molecular imaging	MOLECULE; DISEASE; FLUORODEOXYGLUCOSE; ADHESION	Background. In-111-DOTA-butylamino-NorBIRT (DANBIRT) is a novel radioligand which binds to Leukocyte Function-associated Antigen-1 (LFA-1), expressed on inflammatory cells. This study evaluated In-111-DANBIRT for the visualization of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in mice. Methods and Results. ApoE 2/2 mice, fed an atherogenic diet up to 20 weeks (n = 10), were imaged by SPECT/CT 3 hours post injection of In-111-DANBIRT (similar to 200 pmol, similar to 40 MBq). Focal spots of In-111-DANBIRT were visible in the aortic arch of all animals, with an average Target-to-Background Ratio (TBR) of 1.7 +/- 0.5. In vivo imaging results were validated by ex vivo SPECT/CT imaging, with a TBR up to 11.5 (range 2.6 to 11.5). Plaques, identified by Oil Red O lipid-staining on excised arteries, co-localized with In-111-DANBIRT uptake as determined by ex vivo autoradiography. Subsequent histological processing and in vitro autoradiography confirmed In-111-DANBIRT uptake at plaque areas containing CD68 expressing macrophages and LFA-1 expressing inflammatory cells. Ex vivo incubation of a human carotid endarterectomy specimen with In-111-DANBIRT (similar to 950 nmol, 190 MBq) for 2 hours showed heterogeneous plaque uptake on SPECT/CT, after which immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated co-localization of In-111-DANBIRT uptake and CD68 and LFA-1 expressing cells. Conclusions. Our results indicate the potential of radiolabeled DANBIRT as a relevant imaging radioligand for non-invasive evaluation of atherosclerotic inflammation.	[Meester, E.

Method We included patients with moderate to severe AD and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), presumed to present preclinical AD. Results Both patients with AD and MCI showed significant reductions in alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs in brain regions typically affected by AD pathology. These findings indicate that a reduction in alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs occurs during early symptomatic stages of AD. The alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR availability in these regions correlated with the severity of cognitive impairment, indicating a stage sensitivity of the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR status. Conclusion Together, our results provide evidence for the potential of 2-[(18)] F-A-85380 nAChR PET in the diagnosis of patients at risk for AD. Because of the extraordinary long acquisition time with 2-[F-18] F-A-85380, we developed the new alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR-specific radioligands (+)-and (-)-[F-18] norchloro-fluoro-homoepibatidine (NCFHEB) and evaluated them preclinically. (-)-[F-18] NCFHEB shows twofold higher brain uptake and significantly shorter acquisition times. Therefore, (-)-[F-18] NCFHEB should be a suitable radioligand for larger clinical investigations.

[F-18]-SB209670 could be produced in a total radiochemical yield of 14.9 +/- 3.8% in 162 +/- 7 minutes (n = 6). The radiochemical purity of the isolated radioligand was 99% and the specific activity was 100-150 GBq/4mol. In vitro characterization using ligand-binding assays demonstrated that [F-18]-SB209670 bound with a single subnanomolar affinity to human heart tissue (n = 3) with a K-D = 0.67 +/- 0.14 nM and a B-max = 168.3 +/- 29.3 fmol/mg protein. The binding was time-dependent with a half-time (t(1/2)) for association of 3.8 minutes and an association rate constant (k(obs)) of 0.182 +/- 0.032/min. In vivo distribution in the rat was studied using microPET. Dynamic imaging revealed a fast clearance of [F-18]-SB209670 from the circulation by the liver, indicative of a high degree of metabolism. However, visualization of uptake in the rat heart was achievable and dynamic PET data together with the in vitro results suggest that [F-18]-SB209670 binds rapidly and primarily to endothelin-A receptors in the heart.

In the present study, we further characterized this ligand. The radiation absorbed-dose of [C-11]SA4503 in humans estimated with the tissue distribution in mice, was higher in the liver, kidney and pancreas than in other organs studied, but was low enough for clinical use. The brain uptake of [(11)]SA4503 in mice was reduced to approximately 60-70% by co-injection of carrier SA4S03 and haloperidol, but not by co-injection of any of six ligands for sigma(2) or other receptors, for which SA4503 showed in vitro >100 times weaker affinity than for sigma(1) receptor. In. the cat brain, the uptake in the cortex was higher than that in the cerebellum. The radioactivity in the cortex and cerebellum accumulated for the first 10 min and then gradually decreased until 81.5 min in the baseline measurement, but rapidly decreased in the carrier-loading condition. The receptor-mediated uptake was estimated to be approximately 60-65% of the total radioactivity in. the cortex and cerebellum at 76 min after tracer injection. We have concluded that [C-11]SA4S03 has she potential for mapping sigma(1) receptor by PET.

Limited data on this modality have been published regarding large samples treated in everyday practice. Methods We analyzed prospectively collected registry data regarding lutetium-177 (Lu-177)-PSMA-617 RLT of 254 consecutive men with mCRPC seen in everyday academic practice. Since Lu-177-PSMA-617 was experimental salvage treatment following failure of individually appropriate conventional therapies, patients were generally elderly and heavily pretreated (median age 70 years; prior taxanes 74.0%, 188/254), with late-end-stage disease (visceral metastasis in 32.7%, 83/254). Primary endpoints were response to RLT, defined by changes from baseline serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentration, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), and overall survival (OS), estimated with Kaplan-Meier statistics, and caregiver-reported and patient-reported safety. Unless noted, median (minimum-maximum) values are given. Results Patients received 3 (1-13) Lu-177-PSMA-617 activities (6.5 [2.5-11.6] GBq/cycle) every 5.7 (3.0-11.0) weeks. Best response was >= 50% PSA reduction in 52.0% of patients (132/254). PSA-PFS was 5.5 (95% confidence interval [95%CI] 4.4-6.6) months and OS, 14.5 (95%CI 11.5-17.5) months. In multivariable Cox proportional-hazards modeling, response to the initial <= 2 RLT administrations was the strongest significant prognosticator related to OS (hazard ratio 3.7 [95%CI 2.5-5.5], p < 0.001). No RLT-related deaths or treatment discontinuations occurred; the most frequent RLT-related Grade 3/4 adverse events were anemia (18/254 patients, 7.1%), thrombocytopenia (11/254, 4.3%), and lymphopenia (7/254, 2.8%). RLT-related xerostomia, all grade 1/2, was noted in 53/254 (20.9%). Conclusions In a large, prospectively observed "real-world" cohort with late-stage/end-stage mCRPC and conventional treatment failure, Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT was effective, safe, and well-tolerated. Early biochemical disease control by such therapy was associated with better OS. Prospective study earlier in the disease course may be warranted.

In a single-photon emission tomography (SPET) study in monkeys we recently confirmed that [I-123]E-(R,R)-IQNP ([I-123]E-IQNP) is a radioligand with modest selectivity for the M-1 and M-4 subtypes, whereas [I-123]Z(R,R)-IQNP ([I-123]Z-IQNP) is non-subtype selective. In the present SPET study, E- and Z-IQNP were examined in human subjects. SPET examination was performed on three male subjects after i.v. injection of [I-123]E-IQNP and in another three after i.v. injection of [I-123]Z-IQNP. The binding potential (BP) for [I-123]E-IQNP was calculated using several quantitative approaches with the cerebellum as a reference region, High-performance liquid chromatography was used to measure radioligand metabolism in plasma. Following [I-123]E-IQNP, the radioactivity was hi,oh in the neocortex and striatum, intermediate in the thalamus and low in the pens and cerebellum, which is consistent with the rank order for the regional. density of M-1 and M-4 subtypes in vitro, For all regions, peak equilibrium was identified within the 48-h data acquisition. The simplified reference tissue approach using SPET data from 0 to 48 h was the most reliable in this limited series of subjects. Following injection of [I-123]Z-IQNP, radioactivity was high in the neocortex and striatum, intermediate in the thalamus and pens and low in the cerebellum, which is in agreement with the density of M-1, M-2 and M-4 subtypes as measured in vitro. Quantitative analyses provided indirect support for specific M-2 binding of Z-IQNP in the cerebellum, The high selectivity of [I-123]E-IQNP for M-1 and M-4 receptors allowed the use of cerebellum as a reference region devoid of specific binding, and may be advantageous for applied clinical studies of M-1 and M-4 receptors binding in man. [I-123]Z-IQNP has potential for exploration of M-2 receptor binding in the cerebellum.

The inclusion criteria for that study comprised a pretherapeutic 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET scan showing sufficient tumor uptake using a predefined threshold and the absence of 18F-FDG-positive, PSMA ligand-negative tumor lesions. However, the prognostic value of these PET-based inclusion criteria remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the outcome of mCRPC patients treated with PSMA RLT using TheraP as well as other TheraP-based PET inclusion criteria. Methods:First, patients were dichotomized into 2 groups whose PSMA PET scans did (TheraP contrast-enhanced PSMA [cePSMA] PET-positive) or did not (TheraP cePSMA PET- negative) fulfill the inclusion criteria of TheraP. Notably, unlike in TheraP, 18F-FDG PET was not performed on our patients. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) response (PSA decline >_ 50% from baseline), PSA progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were compared. Additionally, patients were further dichotomized according to predefined SUVmax thresholds different from those used in TheraP to analyze their potential impact on outcome as well. Results:In total, 107 mCRPC patients were included in this analysis (TheraP cePSMA PET-positive, n = 77; TheraP cePSMA PET-negative, n = 30). PSA response rates were higher in TheraP cePSMA PET-positive patients than in TheraP cePSMA PET-negative patients (54.5% vs. 20%, respectively; P = 0.0012). The median PSA progression-free survival (P = 0.007) and OS (P = 0.0007) of patients were significantly longer in the TheraP cePSMA PET-positive group than in the TheraP cePSMA PET-negative group. Moreover, being in the TheraP cePSMA PET- positive group was identified as a significant prognosticator of longer OS (P = 0.003). The application of different SUVmax thresholds for a single hottest lesion demonstrated no influence on outcome in patients eligible for PSMA RLT. Conclusion:Patient selection for PSMA RLT according to the inclusion criteria of TheraP led to a better treatment response and outcome in our preselected patient cohort. However, a relevant number of patients not fulfilling these criteria also showed substantial rates of response.

First-in-Human Evaluation of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Mefway, a PET Radioligand Specific to Serotonin-1A Receptors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; F-18-mefway; serotonin-1A; hippocampus	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; BINDING; METABOLITES; TRANSPORTER; CEREBELLUM; PLASMA	The serotonin-1A (5-HT1A; 5-HT is 5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor is implicated in an array of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Current PET radioligands targeting 5-HT1A receptors have limitations hindering widespread PET studies of this receptor system. The 5-HT1A-specific antagonist radioligand N-{2-[ 4-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazinyl] ethyl}-N-(2-pyridyl)-N-(trans-4-F-18-fluoromethylcyclohexane) carboxamide (F-18-mefway) exhibited promising in vivo properties in rhesus monkeys. The goal of this work was to examine the in vivo cerebral binding profile and metabolism of F-18-mefway in humans. Methods: Dynamic F-18-mefway PET data were acquired for 6 healthy volunteers (4 women, 2 men; age, 22-38 y). Scans were initiated with the injection of 192-204 MBq of radiotracer, and data were acquired for 2 h. Venous blood samples were collected and assayed to examine the in vivo metabolism profile of F-18-mefway. To examine the test-retest variability of F-18-mefway, a second PET scan was acquired at least 2 wk later for 4 subjects. Regional binding potentials (BP(ND)s) were calculated with the multilinear reference tissue model, and voxelwise BPND maps were calculated with Logan graphical analysis. Regions surrounding the brain were carefully inspected for uptake of radiolabeled species in bone. Results: F-18-mefway uptake in the brain occurred quickly, with a peak standardized uptake value (SUV) of 1.7. Rapid washout in the cerebellum resulted in SUVs of 0.2 at 120 min, whereas regions with specific 5-HT1A binding exhibited retention of radioligand, yielding SUVs of 0.4-0.9 at 120 min. Rapid metabolism of F-18-mefway was observed, with no detected F-18-fluoride ions in plasma. BPND values of 2.4 were measured in the mesial temporal lobe, with values of 1.6 in the insular cortex and 0.7-1.0 in other cortical regions. Stable BPND estimates were obtained using 90 min of dynamic data. Average test-retest variability was 8%. No evidence of radioactivity uptake in bone was observed. Conclusion: (18)F(-)mefway exhibits favorable in vivo properties for serotonin 5-HT1A receptor measurements in humans. The simple radiosynthesis, high specific binding profile, and absence of PET signal in bone make F-18-mefway an attractive radiotracer for PET experiments examining the 5-HT1A receptor in neuropsychiatric disorders and drug intervention.

Positron emission tomography imaging of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FEMPA in Alzheimer's disease patients and control subjects	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; Microglia; Translocator protein; Dementia; Alzheimer	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; IN-VIVO; 18 KDA; HUMAN BRAIN; MICROGLIA; DEMENTIA; NEUROINFLAMMATION; LOCALIZATION; POLYMORPHISM	Imaging of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is a potential tool for examining microglial activation and neuroinflammation in early Alzheimer's disease (AD). [F-18]FEMPA is a novel high-affinity second-generation TSPO radioligand that has displayed suitable pharmacokinetic properties in preclinical studies. The aims of this study were to quantify the binding of [F-18]FEMPA to TSPO in AD patients and controls and to investigate whether higher [F-18]FEMPA binding in AD patients than in controls could be detected in vivo. Ten AD patients (five men, five women; age 66.9 +/- 7.3 years; MMSE score 25.5 +/- 2.5) and seven controls (three men, four women; age 63.7 +/- 7.2 years, MMSE score 29.3 +/- 1.0) were studied using [F-18]FEMPA at Turku (13 subjects) and at Karolinska Institutet (4 subjects). The in vitro binding affinity for TSPO was assessed using PBR28 in a competition assay with [H-3]PK11195 in seven controls and eight AD patients. Cortical and subcortical regions of interest were examined. Quantification was performed using a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan graphical analysis (GA). The outcome measure was the total distribution volume (V (T)). Repeated measures analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of group and TSPO binding status on V (T). Five AD patients and four controls were high-affinity binders (HABs). Three AD patients and three controls were mixed-affinity binders. V (T) estimated with Logan GA was significantly correlated with V (T) estimated with the 2TCM in both controls (r = 0.97) and AD patients (r = 0.98) and was selected for the final analysis. Significantly higher V (T) was found in the medial temporal cortex in AD patients than in controls (p = 0.044) if the TSPO binding status was entered as a covariate. If only HABs were included, significantly higher V (T) was found in the medial and lateral temporal cortex, posterior cingulate, caudate, putamen, thalamus and cerebellum in AD patients than in controls (p < 0.05). [F-18]FEMPA seems to be a suitable radioligand for detecting increased TSPO binding in AD patients if their binding status is taken into account.

Elevated Body Mass Index Is Associated with Improved Overall Survival in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Directed Radioligand Therapy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PSMA; prostate cancer; radioligand therapy; overall survival; body composition	ANDROGEN-DEPRIVATION THERAPY; CLINICAL-OUTCOMES; OPEN-LABEL; MEN; FAT; CHEMOTHERAPY; MITOXANTRONE; CABAZITAXEL; ABIRATERONE; PREDNISONE	In patients with prostate cancer scheduled for systemic treatment, being overweight is linked to prolonged overall survival (OS), whereas sarcopenia is associated with shorter OS. We investigated fat-related and body composition parameters in patients undergoing prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed radioligand therapy (RLT) to assess their predictive value for OS. Methods: Body mass index (BMI, in kg/m(2)) and CT-derived body composition parameters (total, subcutaneous, visceral fat area, and psoas muscle area at the L3-L4 level) were determined for 171 patients scheduled for PSMA-directed RLT. After normalization for stature, the psoas muscle index was used to define sarcopenia. Outcome analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression including fat-related and other clinical parameters (Gleason score, C-reactive protein [CRP], lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], hemoglobin, and prostate-specific antigen levels). The Harrell C-index was used for goodness-of-fit analysis. Results: Sixty-five patients (38%) had sarcopenia, and 98 patients (57.3%) had increased BMI. Relative to the 8-mo OS in normal-weight men (BMI < 25), overweight men (25 = BMI > 30) and obese men (BMI =30) achieved a longer OS of 14 mo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-0.99; P = 0.03) and 13 mo (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.29-0.77; P = 0.004), respectively. Sarcopenia showed no impact on OS (11 vs. 12 mo; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.91-2.1; P = 0.09). Most of the body composition parameters were tightly linked to OS on univari-able analyses, with the highest C-index for BMI. In multivariable analy-sis, a higher BMI (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.86-0.97; P = 0.006), lower CRP (HR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14; P < 0.001), lower LDH (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14; P < 0.001), and longer interval between initial diagnosis and RLT (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91-0.99; P = 0.02) were significant pre-dictors of OS. Conclusion: Increased fat reserves assessed by BMI, CRP, LDH, and interval between initial diagnosis and RLT, but not CT-derived body composition parameters, were relevant predictors for OS. As BMI can be altered, future research should investigate whether a high-calorie diet before or during PSMA RLT may improve OS.

Microglial cells were originally thought to be the only source of TSPO overexpression but astrocytes, neurons and endothelial cells can also up-regulate TSPO depending on the pathological context. This study aims to determine the cellular origin of TSPO overexpression in a simplified model of neuroinflammation and to identify the molecular pathways involved. This is essential to better interpret TSPO molecular imaging in preclinical and clinical settings. We used lentiviral vectors (LV) to overexpress the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) in the right striatum of 2-month-old Sprague Dawley rats. A LV encoding for & beta;-Galactosidase (LV-LacZ) was used as control. One month later, TSPO expression was measured by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using [I-125]CLINDE. The fluorescence-activated cell sorting to radioligand-treated tissue (FACS-RTT) method was used to quantify TSPO levels in acutely sorted astrocytes, microglia, neurons and endothelial cells. A second cohort was injected with LV-CNTF and a LV encoding suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), to inhibit the JAK-STAT3 pathway specifically in astrocytes. GFAP and TSPO expressions were quantified by immunofluorescence. We measured a significant increase in TSPO signal in response to CNTF by SPECT imaging. Using FACS-RTT, we observed TSPO overexpression in reactive astrocytes (+ 153 & PLUSMN; 62%) but also in microglia (+ 2088 & PLUSMN; 500%) and neurons (+ 369 & PLUSMN; 117%), accompanied by an increase in TSPO binding sites per cell in those three cell populations. Endothelial cells did not contribute to TSPO signal increase. Importantly, LV-SOCS3 reduced CNTF-induced astrocyte reactivity and decreased global TSPO immunoreactivity (-71% & PLUSMN; 30%), suggesting that TSPO overexpression is primarily mediated by reactive astrocytes. Overall, this study reveals that CNTF induces TSPO in multiple cell types in the rat striatum, through the JAK2-STAT3 pathway in astrocytes, identifying this cell type as the primary mediator of CNTF effects neuroinflammatory processes. Our results highlight the difficulty to interpret TSPO imaging in term of cellular origin without addition cellular analysis by FACS-RTT or quantitative immunostainings. Consequently, TSPO should only be used as a global marker of neuroinflammation.

JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate-specific membrane antigen; radioligand therapy; Lu-177; renal toxicity; kidney dosimetry	LU-177-PSMA-617 THERAPY; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; IMPACT; TISSUE; ORGANS; VOLUME; TUMOR	The radiation dose to the kidneys should be monitored in prostate cancer patients treated with radioligand therapy (RLT) targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). We analyzed whether pretherapeutic kidney function is predictive of subsequent kidney dose and to what extent the cumulative kidney dose at the end of multiple therapy cycles can be predicted from a dosimetry based on the first cycle. Methods: Data of 59 patients treated with at least 2 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 (PSMA RLT) were analyzed. Treatment (median, 6 GBq/cycle) was performed at 6- to 8-wk intervals, accompanied by voxel-based 3-dimensional dosimetry (measured kidney dose) with SPECT/CT on each of days 0-3 and once during days 6-9. Pretherapeutic kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate, mercaptoacetyltriglycine clearance) was correlated to the kidney doses. Cumulative kidney doses at the end of treatment were compared with a dose estimated from the population-based mean kidney dose, individual first-cycle kidney dose, and mean kidney doses of cycles 1, 3, and 5 per administered activity. Results: In total, 176 PSMA RLT cycles were performed, with a median of 3 cycles per patient. The average kidney dose per administered activity of all 176 cycles was 0.67 +/- 0.24 Gy/GBq (range, 0.21-1.60 Gy/GBq). Mercaptoacetyltriglycine clearance and estimated glomerular filtration rate were no reliable predictors of subsequent absorbed kidney dose and showed only small effect sizes (R-2 = 0.080 and 0.014 [P = 0.039 and 0.375], respectively). All simplified estimations of cumulative kidney dose correlated significantly (P < 0.001) with measured kidney doses: estimations based on the individual first-cycle dose were more accurate than the use of the population-based average kidney dose (R-2 = 0.853 vs. 0.560). Dose estimation was best when the doses of cycles 3 and 5 were included as well (R-2 = 0.960). Conclusion: Pretherapeutic renal function was not predictive of subsequent kidney dose during therapy. Extrapolation of individual data from dosimetry of the first cycle was highly predictive of the cumulative kidney dose at the end of treatment. This prediction was further improved by the integration of dose information from every other cycle. In any case, because of a high interindividual variance, an individual dosimetry is advisable.

Little work has been reported on syntheses of other [F-18]2-fluoroethyl arylsulfonates ([F-18]FEOX) that bear a less electron-rich aryl group, even though these might offer enhanced reactivities. Thus, a series of novel [F-18]FEOX (X = benzenesulfonyl, brosyl, nosyl, 3,4-dibromobenzene-sulfonyl) were synthesized and reactivities compared to [F-18]FEOTs. Precursors for radiolabeling (bis-ethylene glycol arylsulfonates) and reference FEOX were synthesized (alcohol + arylsulfonyl chloride + KOSiMe3 in THF). Regardless of substitution pattern, [F-18]FEOX (110 degrees C, 5 min, acetonitrile) were obtained in similar decay-corrected isolated radiochemical yields (RCY; 47-53%). All [F-18]FEOX gave excellent RCYs (64-87%) of the dopamine uptake radioligand, [F-18]FECNT (130 degrees C, 10 min, acetonitrile). The 3,4-dibromobenzensulfonate gave the highest RCY of [F-18]FECNT (87%) and this HPLC-purified labeling agent was used directly for efficient [F-18]FECNT production. When the secondary aniline of an amyloid probe (HMIMPY) or p-nitrophenol was reacted with [F-18]FEOX, RCYs were appreciably higher for brosylate and nosylate than for tosylate, while 3,4-dibromobenzenesulfonate again gave the highest RCY. Owing to the high reactivity of the new [F-18]FEOX and their ease of syntheses via stable precursors, such agents (particularly 3,4-dibromobenzenesulfonate) should be considered as alternatives to [F-18]FEOTs.

In comparison to [177Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T, application of [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 resulted in a significantly improved tumor dose but also higher kidney accumula-tion. Although rhPSMA-7.3 has been initially selected as the lead com-pound for diagnostic application based on the characterization of its gallium complex, a systematic comparison of the most promising 177Lu-labeled rhPSMA ligands is still missing. Thus, this study aimed to identify the rhPSMA ligand with the most favorable pharmacokinetics for 177Lu-radioligand therapy. Methods: The 4 isomers of [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7 (namely [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7.1,-7.2,-7.3, and-7.4), along with the novel radiohybrid ligands [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 and-10.2, were compared with the state-of-the-art compounds [177Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T and [177Lu]Lu-PSMA-617. The comparative evaluation comprised affinity studies (half -maximal inhibitory concentration) and internalization experiments on LNCaP cells, as well as lipophilicity measurements. In addition, we determined the apparent molecular weight (AMW) of each tracer as a parameter for human serum albumin (HSA) binding. Biodistribution stud-ies and small-animal SPECT imaging were performed on LNCaP-tumor bearing mice at 24 h after injection. Results: 177Lu labeling of the radio -hybrids was performed according to the established procedures for the currently established PSMA-targeted ligands. All ligands showed potent binding to PSMA-expressing LNCaP cells, with affinities in the low nanomolar range and high internalization rates. Surprisingly, the most pronounced differences regarded the HSA-related AMW. Although [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7 isomers demonstrated the highest AMW and thus strongest HSA interactions, [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 showed an AMW lower than for [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-7.3 but higher than for the 177Lu-labeled references PSMA I&T and PSMA-617. In biodistribution studies, [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 exhibited the lowest kidney uptake and fastest excretion from the blood pool of all rhPSMA ligands while preserving a high tumor accumulation. Conclusion: Clinical investigation of [177Lu]Lu-rhPSMA-10.1 is highly warranted to determine whether the favorable pharmacokinetics observed in mice will also result in high tumor uptake and decreased absorbed dose to kidneys and other non -target tissues in patients.

PET with radioligands provides a means to image the KOR in vivo and investigate its function in health and disease. The purpose of this study was to develop the selective KOR antagonist C-11-LY2459989 as a PET radioligand and characterize its imaging performance in nonhuman primates. Methods: LY2459989 was synthesized and assayed for in vitro binding to opioid receptors. Ex vivo studies in rodents were conducted to assess its potential as a tracer candidate. C-11-LY2459989 was synthesized by reaction of its iodophenyl precursor with C-11-cyanide, followed by partial hydrolysis of the resulting C-11-cyanophenyl intermediate. Imaging experiments with C-11-LY2459989 were performed in rhesus monkeys with arterial input function measurement. Imaging data were analyzed with kinetic models to derive in vivo binding parameters. Results: LY2459989 is a full antagonist with high binding affinity and selectivity for KOR (0.18., 7.68, and 91.3 nM, respectively, for kappa, mu, and delta receptors). Ex vivo studies in rats indicated LY2459989 as an appropriate tracer candidate with high specific binding signals and confirmed its KOR binding selectivity in vivo. C-11-LY2459989 was synthesized in high radiochemical purity and good specific activity. In rhesus monkeys, C-11-LY2459989 displayed a fast rate of peripheral metabolism. Similarly, C-11-LY2459989 displayed fast uptake kinetics in the brain and an uptake pattern consistent with the distribution of KOR in primates. Pretreatment with naloxone (1 mg/kg, intravenously) resulted in a uniform distribution of radioactivity in the brain. Further, specific binding of C-11-LY2459989 was dose-dependently reduced by the selective KOR antagonist LY2456302 and the unlabeled LY2459989. Regional binding potential values derived from the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method, as a measure of in vivo specific binding signal, were 2.18, 1.39, 1.08, 1.04, 1.03, 0.59, 0.51, and 0.50, respectively, for the globus pallidus, cingulate cortex, insula, caudate, putamen, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus. Conclusion: The novel PET radioligand C-11-LY2459989 displayed favorable pharmacokinetic properties, a specific and KOR-selective binding profile, and high specific binding signals in vivo, thus making it a promising PET imaging agent for KOR.

Promising results with PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy have already been obtained in early-phase studies using various combinations of targeting molecules and radiolabels. Definitive evidence of the safety and efficacy of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in combination with standard-of-care has been demonstrated in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, whose disease had progressed after or during at least one taxane regimen and at least one novel androgen-axis drug. Preliminary data suggest that Lu-177-PSMA-radioligand therapy (RLT) also has high potential in additional clinical situations. Hence, the radiopharmaceuticals [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T are currently being evaluated in ongoing phase 3 trials. The purpose of this guideline is to assist nuclear medicine personnel, to select patients with highest potential to benefit from Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, to perform the procedure in accordance with current best practice, and to prepare for possible side effects and their clinical management. We also provide expert advice, to identify those clinical situations which may justify the off-label use of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 or other emerging ligands on an individual patient basis.

A mutagenesis and screening strategy to generate optimally thermostabilized membrane proteins for structural studies	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							ADENOSINE A(2A) RECEPTOR; SIZE-EXCLUSION CHROMATOGRAPHY; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; RAT NEUROTENSIN RECEPTOR; COUPLED RECEPTOR; BETA(1)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; DRUG DESIGN	The thermostability of an integral membrane protein (MP) in detergent solution is a key parameter that dictates the likelihood of obtaining well-diffracting crystals that are suitable for structure determination. However, many mammalian MPs are too unstable for crystallization. We developed a thermostabilization strategy based on systematic mutagenesis coupled to a radioligand-binding thermostability assay that can be applied to receptors, ion channels and transporters. It takes similar to 6-12 months to thermostabilize a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) containing 300 amino acid (aa) residues. The resulting thermostabilized MPs are more easily crystallized and result in high-quality structures. This methodology has facilitated structure-based drug design applied to GPCRs because it is possible to determine multiple structures of the thermostabilized receptors bound to low-affinity ligands. Protocols and advice are given on how to develop thermostability assays for MPs and how to combine mutations to make an optimally stable mutant suitable for structural studies. The steps in the procedure include the generation of similar to 300 site-directed mutants by Ala/Leu scanning mutagenesis, the expression of each mutant in mammalian cells by transient transfection and the identification of thermostable mutants using a thermostability assay that is based on binding of an I-125-labeled radioligand to the unpurified, detergent-solubilized MP. Individual thermostabilizing point mutations are then combined to make an optimally stable MP that is suitable for structural biology and other biophysical studies.

J	Seeman, P				Seeman, Philip			Dopamine D2<SUP>High</SUP> Receptors Measured Ex Vivo are Elevated in Amphetamine-Sensitized Animals	SYNAPSE			English	Article						Dopamine D2 receptor; dopamine supersensitivity; [H-3](+)PHNO; [H-3]raclopride; D2(High) receptors; schizophrenia	HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; ANTERIOR-PITUITARY; D-2 RECEPTORS; D2 RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; AGONIST; BINDING; SUPERSENSITIVITY; INHIBITION	Although dopamine supersensitivity is a fundamental aspect of diseases such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, the molecular basis of dopamine supersensitivity is not known. Because behavioral dopamine supersensitivity is associated with a marked elevation of striatal dopamine D2 High receptors in vitro, it is important to develop methods to measure D2 High receptors in vivo. The present ex vivo study found that the dopamine agonist NPA ([-]-N-propyl-norapomorphine) inhibited the binding of the agonist [H-3](+)PHNO to rat striatal D2 receptors significantly more than the D2 antagonist [H-3]raclopride, when NPA was coinjected i.v. with each radioligand. These results suggest that the greater sensitivity of [H-3](+)PHNO to inhibition by the coinjected NPA reflects in vivo competition at D2 High receptors. Using rats that had been sensitized to amphetamine, this ex vivo method found that the specific binding of [H-3](+)PHNO that was displaced by 10 mu g/kg of NPA was 2.4-fold higher than that for control rats. These data agree with in vitro data showing a marked increase in D2 High sites after amphetamine sensitization. Therefore, it is recommended that this method of coinjecting the D2 radioligand and the dopamine agonist displacer be used in human positron tomography to detect D2 High receptors in health and disease.

The displacement percentages of [H-3]-DTG and [H-3]-(+)-pentazocine determined in rat liver homogenates by these compounds at the fixed 100 nM concentration have been determined as a preliminary evaluation of their sigma(1) and sigma(2) affinity, respectively. The results suggested that the phenyl substituents may positively modulate, in comparison with the unsubstituted compound, the ability to displace [H-3]-DTG from sigma(2) sites, whereas the same phenyl substituents reduced the displacement percentages of [H-3]-(+)-pentazocine from sigma(1), sites. Some of these compounds were selected for radioligand binding assays. Compounds with a butylene intermediate chain displayed the greatest binding affinity for sigma(2) over sigma(1) receptors. The butylene derivative with 2,4-dimethyl substitution on the phenyl ring showed the greatest sigma(2) affinity (sigma K-2(i) = 5.9 nM) and an appreciable sigma(2) over sigma(1) selectivity (sigma K-1(i)/sigma K-2(i) = 22). The obtained results suggest that a butylene chain separating the indole moiety from variously substituted benzylamino groups may be required to their interaction with a hypothetical secondary sigma(2) binding site.

The specific binding to the sea bass brain membranes was rapid, stable, saturable and reversible. The radioligand binds to a single class of receptor site with the affinity (Kd) of 9.3 +/- 0.6 pM and total binding capacity (Bmax) of 39.08 +/- 0.86 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- SEM, n=4) at mid-light under light-dark (LD) cycles of 12:12. Day-night changes were observed neither in the Kd nor in the Bmax under LD 12:12. Treatment with GTPgammaS significantly increased the Kd and decreased the Bmax both at mid-light and mid-dark. The binding sites were highly specific for 2-phenylmelatonin, 2-iodomelatonin, melatonin, and 6-chloromelatonin. Distribution of melatonin binding sites in the sea bass brain was uneven: The Bmax was determined to be highest in mesencephalic optic tectum-tegmentum and hypothalamus, intermediate in telencephalon, cerebellum-vestibulolateral lobe and medulla oblongata-spinal cord, and lowest in olfactory bulbs with the Kd in the low picomolar range. These results indicate that melatonin released from the pineal organ and/or retina plays neuromodulatory roles in the sea bass brain via G protein-coupled melatonin receptors.

In this study, we report a comparison regarding the specific radioactivity of [C-11]FLB 457 obtained by two different methods of synthesising [C-11]methyl iodide. In addition, the synthesis of unlabelled FLB 457 and the corresponding desmethyl-precursor, starting from commercially available material, is reported. The first method used for [C-11]methyl iodide synthesis was reduction of [C-11]CO2 with lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to [C-11]CH3OH, followed by conversion into [C-11]CH3I with hydrogen iodide. The second, recently developed method uses gas phase halogenation of [C-11]CH4 with iodine. [C-11]FLB 457 was labelled with [C-11]methyl triflate produced on-line from [C-11]methyl iodide. With the first method a specific radioactivity for [C-11]FLB 457 of 2100 Ci/mmol (78 GBq/mu mol) (n=13) at 40 min after end of bombardment (EOB) was achieved. Using the gas phase method a specific radioactivity of 3400 Ci/mmol (126 GBq/mu mol) (n=7) at 40 min EOB could be obtained. The use of the gas phase method also resulted in shorter time for set-up compared to the regular method since no wet chemistry is involved in the preparation of [C-11]methyl iodide.

Baseline clinical characteristics predict overall survival in patients undergoing radioligand therapy with [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T during long-term follow-up	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						PSMA; Prostate cancer; [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T; Radioligand therapy; Overall survival; Prediction	RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; PSMA EXPRESSION	Background Radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands is associated with prolonged overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). A substantial number of patients, however, are prone to treatment failure. We aimed to determine clinical baseline characteristics to predict OS in patients receiving [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T RLT in a long-term follow-up. Materials and methods Ninety-two mCRPC patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T with a follow-up of at least 18 months were retrospectively identified. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed for various baseline characteristics, including laboratory values, Gleason score, age, prior therapies, and time interval between initial diagnosis and first treatment cycle (interval(Diagnosis-RLT), per 12 months). Cutoff values for significant predictors were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. ROC-derived thresholds were then applied to Kaplan-Meier analyses. Results Baseline C-reactive protein (CRP; hazard ratio [HR], 1.10, 95% CI 1.02-1.18; P = 0.01), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; HR, 1.07, 95% CI 1.01-1.11; P = 0.01), aspartate aminotransferase (AST; HR, 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.26; P = 0.001), and interval(Diagnosis-RLT) (HR, 0.95, 95% CI 0.91-0.99; P = 0.02) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS. The following respective ROC-based thresholds were determined: CRP, 0.98 mg/dl (area under the curve [AUC], 0.80); LDH, 276.5 U/l (AUC, 0.83); AST, 26.95 U/l (AUC, 0.73); and interval(Diagnosis-RLT), 43.5 months (AUC, 0.68; P < 0.01, respectively). Respective Kaplan-Meier analyses demonstrated a significantly longer median OS of patients with lower CRP, lower LDH, and lower AST, as well as prolonged interval(Diagnosis-RLT) (P <= 0.01, respectively). Conclusion In mCRPC patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T, baseline CRP, LDH, AST, and time interval until RLT initiation (thereby reflecting a possible indicator for tumor aggressiveness) are independently associated with survival. Our findings are in line with previous findings on [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, and we believe that these clinical baseline characteristics may support the nuclear medicine specialist to identify long-term survivors.

Here we report on some of the pharmacological properties of compound A as well as the characterization of [S-35]compound A as the first nonpeptide bradykinin B-1 receptor radioligand. Compound A inhibited tritiated peptide ligand binding to the cloned human, rabbit, dog, and rat bradykinin B, receptors expressed in CHO cells with K-i values of 0.016, 0.050, 0.56, and 29 nM, respectively. It was inactive at 10 muM in binding assays with the cloned human bradykinin B-2 receptor. In functional antagonist assays with the cloned bradykinin B-1 receptors, compound A inhibited agonist-induced signaling with activities consistent with the competition binding results, but had no antagonist activity at the bradykinin B-2 receptor. Compound A was also found to be a potent antagonist in a rabbit aorta tissue bath preparation and to effectively block des-Arg(9) bradykinin depressor responses in lipopolysaccharide-treated rabbit following intravenous administration. The binding of [S-35]compound A was evaluated with the cloned bradykinin B-1 receptors. In assays with human, rabbit, and dog receptors, [S-35]compound A labeled a single site with K-d values of 0.012, 0.064, and 0.37 nM, respectively, and with binding site densities equivalent to those obtained using the conventional tritiated peptide ligands. Binding assays with the cloned rat bradykinin B-1 receptor were not successful, presumably due to the low affinity of the ligand for this species receptor. There was no specific binding of the ligand detected in CHO cells expressing the human bradykinin B-2 receptor. In assays with the cloned human bradykinin B, receptor, the pharmacologies of the binding of [S-35]compound A and [H-3][Leu(9)]des-Arg(10)-kallidin were the same. The high signal-to-noise ratio obtained with [S-35]compound A will allow this ligand to be a very useful tool for future investigations of the bradykinin B I receptor. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The displacement of radioligand binding by fesoterodine, SPM 7605 and standard agents in membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the different human muscarinic receptors (M1-M5) was characterized. Agonistic and antagonistic activities were studied using different CHO cell lines stably expressing the human recombinant muscarinic receptor subtypes. The effects of fesoterodine and SPM 7605 on isolated bladder strips contracted by carbachol or electrical field stimulation (EFS) were investigated. In vivo the effects of fesoterodine and SPM 7605 on micturition variables were assessed using continuous cystometry in conscious female Sprague-Dawley rats, and compared to those of oxybutynin and atropine. In vitro SPM 7605 potently inhibited radioligand binding at all five human muscarinic receptor subtypes with equal affinity across all five. Fesoterodine had a similar balanced selectivity profile but was less potent than SPM 7605. Both substances were competitive antagonists of cholinergic agonist-stimulated responses in human M1-M5 cell lines and had a similar potency and selectivity profile to the radioligand-binding studies. In rat bladder strips, fesoterodine and SPM 7605 caused a rightward shift of the concentration-response curve for carbachol with no depression of the maximum, and concentration-dependently reduced contractions induced by EFS. The potency of both drugs was similar to that of atropine and oxybutynin. In the presence of the esterase inhibitor neostigmine, the concentration-response curve of fesoterodine was shifted to the right, suggesting that part of the activity was caused by metabolism to SPM 7605 by tissue enzymes. In vivo, low doses (0.01 mg/kg) of fesoterodine and SPM 7605 reduced micturition pressure and increased intercontraction intervals and bladder capacity, but did not affect residual volume. Fesoterodine and its active metabolite, SPM 7605, are nonsubtype selective, competitive antagonists of human muscarinic receptors, but SPM 7605 has greater potency than the parent compound. Pharmacodynamic studies in the rat bladder in vitro confirm the competitive muscarinic antagonist profile of these agents in a native tissue preparation, and in vivo studies in the rat showed effects on bladder function consistent with a muscarinic antagonist profile.

We studied whether NaF shows any uptake in the brain tissue of patients with acute ischemic stroke. This is a post-hoc analysis of previously reported cerebral atherosclerosis research with positron emission tomography which applied the two radioligands, F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and NaF for the detection of culprit atheroma among 20 acute cerebral infarction patients (mean age=75.1 +/- 9.0 years; 10 women). In this study, we measured the maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean) of NaF uptake level in the cerebral infarct region between lesions with and without diffusion weighted image (DWI) positivity, indicating acute ischemic cell death. Correlation analysis was performed between NaF uptake levels and imaging and clinical variables, including neurological severity. The NaF uptake levels were significantly higher in DWI positive lesions than in negative lesions (SUVmax: 2.0 [0.60-4.2] versus 0.20 [0.10-0.40], p=0.021 by Mann-Whitney U test). The intensity of NaF uptake (SUVmax) was significantly correlated with the initial neurological severity (Spearman's rho=0.579, p=0.007) and white blood cell count (Spearman's rho=0.626, pp0.003). During ischemic stroke NaF was concentrated in brain tissue undergoing acute cell death and its uptake intensity was correlated with neurological severity, suggesting that NaF could reflect acute ischemic cell death after stroke.

Cerebellar heterogeneity and its impact on PET data quantification of 5-HT receptor radioligands	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Reference region; cerebellum; serotonin (5-HT) receptors; vermis	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POSTMORTEM HUMAN BRAIN; SEROTONIN 1A BINDING; MAJOR DEPRESSION; REFERENCE REGION; IN-VIVO; TRANSPORTER; OCCUPANCY; ALGORITHM; VARIANCE	In the quantification of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer binding, a commonly used method is reference tissue modeling (RTM). RTM necessitates a proper reference and a ubiquitous choice for G-protein coupled receptors is the cerebellum. We investigated regional differences in uptake within the grey matter of the cerebellar hemispheres (CH), the cerebellar white matter (CW), and the cerebellar vermis (CV) for five PET radioligands targeting the serotonin system. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of choosing different reference regions when quantifying neocortical binding. The PET and MR images are part of the Cimbi database: 5-HT1AR ([C-11]CUMI-101, n = 8), 5-HT1BR ([C-11]AZ10419369, n = 36), 5-HT2AR ([C-11]Cimbi-36, n = 29), 5-HT4R ([C-11]SB207145, n = 59), and 5-HTT ([C-11]DASB, n = 100). We employed SUIT and FreeSurfer to delineate CV, CW, and CH and quantified mean standardized uptake values (SUV) and nondisplaceable neocortical binding potential (BPND). Statistical difference was assessed with paired nonparametric two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and multiple comparison corrected via false discovery rate. We demonstrate significant radioligand specific regional differences in cerebellar uptake. These differences persist when using different cerebellar regions for RTM, but the influence on the neocortical BPND is small. Nevertheless, our data highlight the importance of validating each radioligand carefully for defining the optimal reference region.

Despite these patients' poor prognosis, accurate estimation of their overall survival (OS) is essential to determine whether benefits exist from the treatment and whether the loss of valuable time and unnecessary side effects can be avoided. The aim of the present study is to evaluate whether various biochemical markers can predict OS in men undergoing PSMA-RLT and whether the changes assessed after PSMA-RLT correlate with the OS. Methods The tested tumor markers in this retrospective analysis were alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP), prostate-specific antigen (PSA), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), chromogranin A, and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (pro-GRP). For the evaluation, we performed blood tests before each PSMA-RLT cycle and during follow-up visits (which were 2-3 months apart). All patients were followed up until their deaths. To test the correlations between the tumor markers and survival, we conducted the logrank tests and the multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression model. The significance level was set atP < .05. Results The study included 137 patients who received a total of 487 PSMA-RLT cycles between January 2015 and November 2017. Of the tested biochemical tumor markers, baseline ALP (120 U/L cut-off), LDH (248 U/L cut-off), and PSA (first quartile cut-off) correlated significantly with survival post-PSMA-RLT (P < .001 for ALP and LDH, andP = .007 for PSA). Stable and/or decreased values in most of the initially abnormal parameters were associated with significantly better OS; these parameters were ALP (P = .009), LDH (P = .005), PSA (P < .001), and pro-GRP (P = .013). The BAP and ALP responses also correlated significantly with survival in patients with bone metastases (P = .002 andP < .001, respectively). Furthermore, there was a strong correlation of the kinetic patterns of PSA, ALP, BAP, and LDH with the survival, showing that patients with steadily increasing markers had the shortest OS. Conclusion Along with the established tumor marker PSA, ALP, LDH, BAP, and pro-GRP were correlated with the OS post-PSMA-RLT in the univariate and multivariate analyses.

The naphthamide compounds that were prepared include N-(1-alkylpiperidin-4-yl)-4-bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamides (1-6), (S)-N-(1-alkylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-4-bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamides (7-12), (R)-N-(1-alkylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-4-bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamides (13-18), (S)-N-(1-alkyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-4-bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamides (19 -25), (R)-N-(1-alkyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-4-bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamides (26-31), and N-(9-alkyl-9-azabicyclo-[3.3.1]nonan-3 beta -yl)-4- bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamides (32, 33). The results of in vitro radioligand binding studies indicated that the majority of the naphthamide analogues bound with high affinity at both the D-2 and D-3 dopamine receptor subtypes and most of the compounds demonstrated some selectivity for the dopamine D-3 dopamine receptor subtype. These results demonstrated that both the structure of the central amine moiety (piperidine, pyrrolidine, and 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane) ring and the N-(alkyl) substitution on the amine significantly effects the binding affinity at D-2 and D-3 dopamine receptors. The bulkiness of the N-(1-alkyl) substituent was found to (a) have no effect on pharmacologic selectivity, (b) increase the affinity at Ds receptors, or (c) decrease the affinity at D-2 receptors. The most potent analogue in this series was (S)-N-(1-cycloheptylpyrrolidin-3-yl)-4-bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamide (10), which had equilibrium dissociation (K-i) values of 1.8 and 0.2 nM for D-2 and D-3 receptors, respectively. The most selective analogue was (R)-N-(1-cycloheptyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-4-bromo-1-methoxy-2-naphthamide (30), which had K-i values of 62.8 and 2.4 nM for D-2 and D-3 receptors, respectively. Radioligand binding results for sigma receptors indicated that the structure of the amine moiety and the N-(l-alkyl) substitutions also significantly influence the affinity and selectivity of these compounds at the sigma (1) and sigma (2) sigma receptor subtypes. The two naphthamides containing a 9-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-3 beta -yl central ring were found to be selective for sigma (2) receptors.

Different Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) Receptor Ligands Show Distinct Kinetics and Biased or Partial Agonism for Homodimer and Heterodimer Formation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ERBB RECEPTORS; AUTOPHOSPHORYLATION SITES; KINASE ACTIVATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BREAST-CANCER; MECHANISM; DOMAIN; BINDING; PROTEIN; IDENTIFICATION	The EGF receptor has seven different cognate ligands. Previous work has shown that these different ligands are capable of inducing different biological effects, even in the same cell. To begin to understand the molecular basis for this variation, we used luciferase fragment complementation to measure ligand-induced dimer formation and radioligand binding to study the effect of the ligands on subunit-subunit interactions in EGF receptor (EGFR) homodimers and EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers. In luciferase fragment complementation imaging studies, amphiregulin (AREG) functioned as a partial agonist, inducing only about half as much total dimerization as the other three ligands. However, unlike the other ligands, AREG showed biphasic kinetics for dimer formation, suggesting that its path for EGF receptor activation involves binding to both monomers and preformed dimers. EGF, TGF alpha, and betacellulin (BTC) appear to mainly stimulate receptor activation through binding to and dimerization of receptor monomers. In radioligand binding assays, EGF and TGF alpha exhibited increased affinity for EGFR/ErbB2 heterodimers compared with EGFR homodimers. By contrast, BTC and AREG showed a similar affinity for both dimers. Thus, EGF and TGF alpha are biased agonists, whereas BTC and AREG are balanced agonists with respect to selectivity of dimer formation. These data suggest that the differences in biological response to different EGF receptor ligands may result from partial agonism for dimer formation, differences in the kinetic pathway utilized to generate activated receptor dimers, and biases in the formation of heterodimers versus homodimers.

This Substitution allows NAADP to bind to a membrane-localized binding site in sea urchin egg homogenates with an IC50 at least 1000-fold greater than that of NADP as measured by competition radioligand binding assays. This suggests that the NAADP receptor protein must include certain features in the NAADP binding site that regulate this specificity. In order to investigate this interaction, we synthesised a series of NAADP analogues differing from NAADP at the 3' position of the pyridine ring that included both simple carboxylic acid analogues as well as a series of chemical isosters. We then investigated both their affinity for the NAADP binding site in sea urchin egg homogenates and their ability to activate the NAADP sensitive Ca2+ channel. We hereby show that a negative charge at the 3' position is an important determinant of affinity but the protein displays a large tolerance for the size of the group. Furthermore, the protein does not easily accommodate multiple charged groups or large uncharged groups. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Vivo Evaluation of 6 Analogs of <SUP>11</SUP>C-ER176 as Candidate <SUP>18</SUP>F-Labeled Radioligands for 18-kDa Translocator Protein	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						translocator protein; neuroinflammation; PET; specific-to-nondisplaceable uptake; radiometabolites	18 KDA; PET RADIOLIGANDS; BINDING; BRAIN; POLYMORPHISM; NEUROINFLAMMATION; NOMENCLATURE; SENSITIVITY; RECEPTORS; AFFINITY	Because of its excellent ratio of specific to nondisplaceable uptake, the radioligand C-11-ER176 can successfully image 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker of inflammation, in the human brain and accurately quantify target density in homozygous low-affinity binders. Our laboratory sought to develop an F-18-labeled TSPO PET radioligand based on ER176 with the potential for broader distribution. This study used generic C-11 labeling and in vivo performance in the monkey brain to select the most promising among 6 fluorine-containing analogs of ER176 for subsequent labeling with longer-lived F-18. Methods: Six fluorine-containing analogs of ER176-3 fluoro and 3 trifluoromethyl isomers-were synthesized and labeled by C-11 methylation at the secondary amide group of the respective N-desmethyl precursor. PET imaging of the monkey brain was performed at baseline and after blockade by N-butan-2-yl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide (PK11195). Uptake was quantified using radiometabolite-corrected arterial input function. The 6 candidate radioligands were ranked for performance on the basis of 2 in vivo criteria: the ratio of specific to nondisplaceable uptake (i.e., nondisplaceable binding potential [BPND]) and the time stability of total distribution volume (V-T), an indirect measure of lack of radiometabolite accumulation in the brain. Results: Total TSPO binding was quantified as V-T corrected for plasma free fraction (V-T/f(P)) using Logan graphical analysis for all 6 radioligands. V-T/f(P) was generally high at baseline (222 +/- 178 mL.cm(-3)) and decreased by 70%-90% after preblocking with PK11195. BPND calculated using the Lassen plot was 9.6 +/- 3.8; the o-fluoro radioligand exhibited the highest BPND (12.1), followed by the m-trifluoromethyl (11.7) and m-fluoro (8.1) radioligands. For all 6 radioligands, V-T reached 90% of the terminal 120-min values by 70 min and remained relatively stable thereafter, with excellent identifiability (SEs < 5%), suggesting that no significant radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Conclusion: All 6 radioligands had good BPND and good time stability of V-T Among them, the o-fluoro, m-trifluoromethyl, and m-fluoro compounds were the 3 best candidates for development as radioligands with an F-18 label.

Along the southern Atlantic coast of Morocco, aquaculture and intensive artisan] fishing practices have recently been particularly heavily impacted, and toxic species have been observed in increasing intensity and frequency. In the 1990's a regulatory monitoring program was established for the coastal waters off Morocco by the National Institute of Fisheries Research (INRH), to reduce the risk of intoxication with biotoxins. The regulatory monitoring is conducted weekly and includes toxic phytoplankton enumeration and identification, as well as saxitoxin (STX) analysis in seafood using the mouse bioassay (MBA). Animal testing remains the most widely used screening method for PSP toxin detection, yet its use is being reconsidered for animal-related ethical issues, as well as for practical considerations. To be able to better evaluate alternatives to animal testing, the performance of a nuclear-based radioligand-receptor binding assay (RBA) for paralytic shellfish toxins was assessed and compared with the MBA using four commercially important shellfish matrices, including cockles Cerastoderma edule, razor shells Solen marginatus, oysters Crassostrea gigas, and mussels Perna perna. Over 50 samples were collected and analysed as part of the regulatory monitoring framework including a suite of monthly samples from 2017 and all samples identified as toxic by MBA since 2011. Testing of reference material and evaluation of assay-critical parameters (e.g. slope of calibration curve, internal quality control QC and IC50) confirmed the robustness of the RBA methodology. With this RBA method, STX-like activity detected in shellfish samples ranged from 33 to 8500 mu g STX equivalents per kg. RBA data were significantly correlated (P < 0.0001, Pearson r = 0.96) with the MBA-derived dataset. Importantly, the RBA method allowed for the detection and quantification of PSP toxins at levels not detectable by using the mouse bioassay. The limits of quantification of the RBA was calculated and found to be 10-fold lower than that of the MBA, respectively 35.24 +/- 5.99 and 325 mu g STX equivalents per kg of tissue. In addition, the RBA was easier to use and produced reliable results more rapidly than the MBA and without use of live animals. Considering the increasing risks associated with harmful algal blooms, globally and in Morocco, together with the increased development of aquaculture production and seafood consumption and the difficulties of live animal testing, these findings indicate that the RBA method is a reliable and effective alternative to the MBA method.

In HUV rings, prazosin 1 muM did not affect contractile responses elicited by 5-HT, ruling out the involvement of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in contractile responses to 5-HT. 5-HT-induced contractions were competitively blocked by ketanserin, a 5-HT2A-selective antagonist. The apparent pA(2) value was 9.8 and the Schild slope significantly less than unity, suggesting that 5-HT-induced responses are mediated by a heterogeneous receptor population. alpha-methyl-5-HT, a selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist, induced contractions that were antagonized in a competitive manner by ketanserin. The slope regression was not significantly different from unity and the pA(2) value was 8.8. The selective 5-HT2A ligand spiperone produced a parallel rightward shift on 5-HT CRCs in HUV rings. The calculated pA2 was 9.0, which is in accord for an interaction with the 5-HT2A receptor subtype. alpha-methyl-5-HT CRCs were competitively blocked by spiperone treatment. The Schild analysis yielded a pA2 of 9.1 with a slope not significantly different from unity. The 5-HT2C/2A antagonist mesulergine 10 nM did not affect 5-HT CRCs, suggesting that 5-HT2C receptors are not involved in 5-HT-elicited contractions. Higher concentrations of mesulergine showed a parallel rightward shift on 5-HT responses. The calculated pA2 was 7.44, which suggests an interaction with the 5-HT2A receptor subtype. In addition, mesulergine competitively blocked alpha-methyl-5-HT CRCs. The Schild slope was not significantly different from unity and the pA(2) value was 7.98. The binding of [H-3]ketanserin to HUV membranes was saturable and of high affinity. Ketanserin displayed a monophasic curve which was best fit with a single component of binding. Nonlinear least squares analysis of the binding curves revealed a high affinity K-d of 0.30 nM and a B-max of 134 fmol/mg protein. These findings provide strong pharmacological evidence of the involvement of 5-HT2A receptors in 5-HT-induced vasoconstriction in HUV. In addition, the contribution of another receptor population cannot be excluded. The results also suggest that this receptor population is neither an alpha(1)-adrenoceptor nor a 5-HT2C receptor subtype.

High intrinsic efficacy agonists (e.g., etorphine), but not lower intrinsic efficacy agonists (e.g., morphine), produce mu-opioid receptor down-regulation and can alter the abundance of mu-opioid receptor mRNA. Conversely, opioid antagonists substantially increase the density of mu-opioid receptors without changing its mRNA. p-Opioid receptor up-regulation has been associated with decreases in the trafficking protein dynamin-2, whereas mu-opioid receptor down-regulation produces an increase in dynamin-2 abundance. To probe the differences between opioid agonist and antagonist-induced mu-opioid receptor regulation, the current study determined changes in mu-opioid receptor density using a combined radioligand binding ([H-3] DAMGO) and quantitative Western blotting approach in mouse spinal cord. Furthermore, the differences between intermittent and continuous dosing protocols were evaluated. Continuous (7-8 days) s.c. infusions of naloxone (5 mg/kg/day) or naltrexone (15 mg s.c. implant pellet) increased p-opioid receptor density in radioligand binding assays (approximate to+80%) in mouse spinal cord and down-regulated dynamin-2 abundance (approximate to-30%), but had no effect on the abundance of immunoreactive It-opioid receptor. Continuous (7 days) s.c. infusion of etorphine (200 mug/kg/day) decreased immunoreactive mu-opioid receptor (approximate to-35%) and [H-3] DAMGO binding (approximate to-30%), and concurrently increased dynamin-2 abundance (approximate to+40%). Continuous (7 days) morphine infusion (40 mg/kg/day plus 25 mg s.c. implant pellet) had no effect on any outcome measure. Delivery of the same daily dose of etorphine or naloxone using intermittent (every 24 h for 7 days) s.c. administration had no effect on immunoreactive mu-opioid receptor, [H-3] DAMGO binding or dynamin-2 abundance. These data indicate that mu-opioid receptor density, determined in radioligand binding assays, and immunoreactive dynamin-2 abundance are regulated by continuous, but not intermittent, opioid ligand treatment. Furthermore, the differential regulation of mu-opioid receptor abundance by agonists and antagonists in immunoblotting assays contrasts with changes in [H-3] DAMGO binding. Taken together, these results suggest that etorphine-induced down-regulation may depend upon It-opioid receptor degradation and changes in dynamin-2-mediated receptor trafficking. Conversely, antagonist-induced up-regulation does not require an increase in p-opioid receptor synthesis and may entail conversion of receptors to an appropriate conformation to bind ligand, as well as changes in receptor trafficking.

Specific dosimetry for each patient is an important factor in planning the patient's treatment process. This study aimed to perform an image-based absorbed dose calculation for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer with Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617. Methods The individualized patient dosimetry calculations were based on whole-body planar scintigraphy images acquired in 10 patients with a mean age of 71.4 +/- 6.07 years (range 63-85 years) at approximately 0-2 h, 4-6 h, 18-24 h, and 36-48 h after administration of the mean 6253 +/- 826.4 MBq (range 5500-7400 MBq) of Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617. Time-activity curves were generated for various organs. For count conversion to activities, calibration factors were calculated. Finally, the absorbed dose for an individual cycle was calculated using IDIAC-DOSE 2.1 software. Results On average, the calculated absorbed dose for the kidneys and salivary glands were 0.46 +/- 0.09 mGy/MBq and 0.62 +/- 0.07 mGy/MBq, respectively. Conclusions Based on the results, the(177)Lu-PSMA-617 therapy is a safe method for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer patients. Large inter-individual variations in organ dose were found, demonstrating the need for patient-specific dosimetry and treatment planning.

Aiming at a radioligand enabling robust and comparative binding studies at the h/m/rH(4)Rs, 2,4-diaminopyrimidines were synthesized and pharmacologically investigated. The most notable compounds identified were two (partial) agonists with comparable potencies at the h/m/rH(4)Rs: UR-DEBa148 (N-neopentyl-4-(1,4,6,7-tetrahydro-5H-imidazo[4,5-c]pyridin-5-yl)pyrimidin-2-amine bis(2,2,2-trifluoroacetate), 43), the most potent [pEC(50) (reporter gene assay) = 9.9/9.6/10.3] compound in the series being slightly G-protein biased and UR-DEBa176 [(R)-4-[3-(dimethylamino)pyrrolidin-1-yl]-N-neopentylpyrimidin-2-amine bis(2,2,2-trifluoroacetate), 46, pEC(50) (reporter gene assay) = 8.7/9.0/9.2], a potential "cold" form of a tritiated H4R ligand. After radiolabeling, binding studies with [3H]UR-DEBa176 ([H-3]46) at the h/m/rH(4)Rs revealed comparable K-d values (41/17/22 nM), low nonspecific binding (11-17%, similar to K-d), and fast associations/dissociations (25-30 min) and disclosed [H-3]UR-DEBa176 as useful molecular tool to determine h/m/rH(4)R binding affinities for H4R ligands.

Binding of the Radioligand SIL23 to α-Synuclein Fibrils in Parkinson Disease Brain Tissue Establishes Feasibility and Screening Approaches for Developing a Parkinson Disease Imaging Agent	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LEWY BODIES; IN-VITRO; CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; TAU; NEURODEGENERATION; PATHOLOGY	Accumulation of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) fibrils in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites is the pathological hallmark of Parkinson disease (PD). Ligands that bind alpha-syn fibrils could be utilized as imaging agents to improve the diagnosis of PD and to monitor disease progression. However, ligands for alpha-syn fibrils in PD brain tissue have not been previously identified and the feasibility of quantifying alpha-syn fibrils in brain tissue is unknown. We report the identification of the I-125-labeled alpha-syn radioligand SIL23. [I-125]SIL23 binds alpha-syn fibrils in postmortem brain tissue from PD patients as well as an alpha-syn transgenic mouse model for PD. The density of SIL23 binding sites correlates with the level of fibrillar alpha-syn in PD brain tissue, and [I-125] SIL23 binding site densities in brain tissue are sufficiently high to enable in vivo imaging with high affinity ligands. These results identify a SIL23 binding site on alpha-syn fibrils that is a feasible target for development of an alpha-syn imaging agent. The affinity of SIL23 for alpha-syn and its selectivity for alpha-syn versus Ab and tau fibrils is not optimal for imaging fibrillar alpha-syn in vivo, but we show that SIL23 competitive binding assays can be used to screen additional ligands for suitable affinity and selectivity, which will accelerate the development of an alpha-syn imaging agent for PD.

In competition against the CB, antagonist, [H-3]SR141716A, the agonist, WIN 55,212-2 yielded a biphasic isotherm. The majority of binding was to a high-affinity state that was significantly reduced by the GTP analogue, Gpp(NH)p. Interestingly, 5-HT enhanced the high-affinity binding constant of WIN 55,212-2 while attenuating the proportion of high-affinity binding. 5-HT also significantly reduced the proportion of high-affinity binding of the cannabinoid agonist, HU 210, but had no effect on the agonist, CP 55,940. The effect of 5-HT on WIN 56,212-2 binding was inhibited by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin as well as Gpp(NH)p, suggesting a dependence on the 5-HT2 receptor and on G protein-receptor interactions, respectively. Subsequent [H-3]WIN 55,212-2 dissociation kinetic experiments revealed that 5-HT promoted a slower-dissociating species of radiolabelled agonist-receptor complex. Our findings support a membrane-delimited cross-talk between two G protein-coupled receptors that are co-localized in certain cells of the central nervous system. Intriguingly, the cannabinoid agonist dependence of the 5-HT modulatory effect suggests that agonist-specific conformations of the CB, receptor may also be important in determining the extent of this cross-talk.

However, the appearance of these autoantibodies in acute rejection after orthotopic liver transplantation has not yet been reported, Liver-kidney-microsome type-1 (LKM-1) antibodies directed against the autoantigen cytochrome CYP2D6 define a group of patients with autoimmune hepatitis type-2 (AIH-2), distinct from autoimmune hepatitis type-1 (AIH-1) in which antinuclear antibodies and anti-smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) with actin specificity are present in patient sera. Autoantibodies were studied by the quantitative CYP2D6 radioligand assay (RLA) that uses a radiolabeled CYP2D6 as antigen, immunoblotting using recombinant CYP2D6 protein and human liver microsomal and cytosolic fractions, and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) using rat kidney-stomach-liver cryostat sections. In addition, the specificity of anti-SMA was detected by IIF on HEp2 cell line harvested with colchicin. This report describes the time course of CYP2D6 antibodies and the appearance of anti-SMA (without anti-actin, cytokeratin and vimentin reactivity) associated with acute rejection during a 2-year follow-up, in a patient who underwent transplantation at end-stage type 2 autoimmune hepatitis. In addition, we report a new reactivity against an unknown 40-kDa protein using a rat cytosolic fraction. The detection of autoantibodies in sequential samples may be important to better predict rejection or relapse, and to establish adequate therapy.

However, it has slow kinetics and a large fraction of bound activity is nondisplaceable. In an attempt to address these problems, two epibatidine-based alpha(4)beta(2) nicotinic antagonists, coded FPhEP and F2PhEP, were evaluated in vivo in baboons. They were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 from the corresponding N-Boc-protected bromo-derivatives and the no-carrier-added K[F-18]F-Kryptofix((R))222 complex. Radiochemically pure [F-18]FPhEP or [F-18]F2PhEP was obtained in 80 min in amounts of 1.11-2.22 GBq (111-185 GBq/mu mol). After injection of 215 MBq of [F-18]FPhEP or [F-18]FPhEP, dynamic PET data were acquired. Thalamic radioactivity peaked at 20 min (4.9% +/- 0.2% ID/100 mL tissue) for [F-18]FPhEP For [F-18]F2PhEP, the peak was at 45 min (3.3% +/- 0.1% ID/100 mL tissue). Regional distribution of both radiotracers was in accordance with the known distribution of nAChRs. In presaturation experiments, nicotine, cytosine, or FPhEP reduced brain radioactivity of [F-18]FPhEP. In a displacement experiment with nicotine only a small amount of [F-18]F2PhEP was dislodged. In spite of a moderate to high in vitro affinity, both ligands do not fulfill the widely adopted criteria for a PET radioligand. (c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The small intestine, and especially the ileum, is one of the most common locations for these neoplasms. Most of them are well-differentiated and slow-growing tumours; uncommonly - neuroendocrine carcinomas. Their symptoms may be untypical, and their diagnosis may be delayed or accidental. Most often, the first manifestation of ANEN is their acute inflammation. Typical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome occur in approximately 20-30% of SINENs patients with dis- tant metastases. In laboratory diagnostics, it is most useful to determine the concentration of chromogranin A (CgA) and assessment of urinary or plasma the 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid concentration is helpful in the diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome. The most commonly used imaging methods are ultrasound (US) examination, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), colonoscopy, and somatostatin receptor imaging (SRI). Histopathological examination is crucial for the proper diagnosis and treatment of patients with SINENs and ANENs. The treatment of choice is a surgical procedure, either radical or palliative. Long-acting somatostatin analogues (SSAs) are essential in the medical treatment of functional and non-functional SINENs. In patients with SINENs, at the stage of dissemina-tion with progression during SSAs treatment, with high expression of somatostatin receptors on functional imaging, radioligand therapy should be considered first followed by targeted therapies - everolimus. Recommendations for patient monitoring are also presented.

Naltrexone modulates dopamine release following chronic, but not acute amphetamine administration: a translational study	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ENDOGENOUS OPIOID RELEASE; ORAL D-AMPHETAMINE; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; SUBJECTIVE RESPONSE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; INDUCED INCREASES; RECEPTOR-BINDING; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; COCAINE	The opioid antagonist naltrexone has been shown to attenuate the subjective effects of amphetamine. However, the mechanisms behind this modulatory effect are currently unknown. We hypothesized that naltrexone would diminish the striatal dopamine release induced by amphetamine, which is considered an important mechanism behind many of its stimulant properties. We used positron emission tomography and the dopamine D2-receptor radioligand [C-11]raclopride in healthy subjects to study the dopaminergic effects of an amphetamine injection after pretreatment with naltrexone or placebo. In a rat model, we used microdialysis to study the modulatory effects of naltrexone on dopamine levels after acute and chronic amphetamine exposure. In healthy humans, naltrexone attenuated the subjective effects of amphetamine, confirming our previous results. Amphetamine produced a significant reduction in striatal radioligand binding, indicating increased levels of endogenous dopamine. However, there was no statistically significant effect of naltrexone on dopamine release. The same pattern was observed in rats, where an acute injection of amphetamine caused a significant rise in striatal dopamine levels, with no effect of naltrexone pretreatment. However, in a chronic model, naltrexone significantly attenuated the dopamine release caused by reinstatement of amphetamine. Collectively, these data suggest that the opioid system becomes engaged during the more chronic phase of drug use, evidenced by the modulatory effect of naltrexone on dopamine release following chronic amphetamine administration. The importance of opioid-dopamine interactions in the reinforcing and addictive effects of amphetamine is highlighted by the present findings and may help to facilitate medication development in the field of stimulant dependence.

The aim of this study was to perform image-based absorbed dose calculation for critical organs during the first cycle of [Lu-177]DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy in a small cohort of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Nine patients with a history of prostate cancer documented by histopathology and radiologic evidence of metastatic diseases underwent radioligand therapy with [Lu-177]DKFZ-PSMA-617. Conjugated planar whole-body scintigraphies acquired at 0.5, 24, 48, 72, and 168 h post-injection were analyzed by regions of interest, and time-activity curves were generated for various organs. Cumulated activities and residence times were calculated by bi-exponential fit of the time-activity curves. Mean absorbed doses were finally estimated using OLINDA/EXM1.1 (TM). Additionally, the uncertainty when omitting the last measurement (168 h p.i.) was studied. The following mean absorbed doses were calculated: 2.82 mGy/MBq for the lacrimal glands, 0.72 mGy/MBq for the salivary glands, 0.53 mGy/MBq for the kidneys, and 0.42 mGy/MBq for the nasal mucous membrane. Omitting the last measurement resulted in a mean deviation of 10 to 25 % for absorbed dose values as compared to the ones received by analyzing all measurements. Absorbed organ doses of [Lu-177]DKFZ-PSMA-617 therapy are not likely to be critical for kidneys, salivary glands, and the nasal mucous membrane. The lacrimal glands may represent the dose-limiting organs. Whole-body scintigraphy appears sufficient for dose estimation, but late measurements are mandatory, if accurate dose calculation is required.

Treadmill exercise elevates striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding potential in patients with early Parkinson's disease	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						basal ganglia; experience-dependent plasticity; fallypride; motor behavior; neuroplasticity; PET imaging; rehabilitation; running	1-METHYL-4-PHENYL-1,2,3,6-TETRAHYDROPYRIDINE-LESIONED MOUSE MODEL; BASAL GANGLIA; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; RELEASE; PET; RADIOLIGAND; PROJECTION; RECOVERY; RISK	We have previously demonstrated changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission after intensive exercise in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-lesioned mouse model of Parkinson's disease (PD), including an increase in the dopamine D-2 receptor (DA-D2R), using noninvasive PET imaging with the radioligand [F-18]fallypride. The purpose of this feasibility and translational study was to examine whether intensive exercise leads to similar alterations in DA-D2R expression using PET imaging with [F-18]fallypride in individuals with early-stage PD. In this pilot study, four patients with early-stage PD were randomized to receive intensive exercise (treadmill training sessions three times/week for 8 weeks) or no exercise. Two healthy age-matched individuals participated in treadmill training. Alterations in the DA-D2R binding potential (BP) as a marker for receptor expression were determined using PET imaging with [F-18]fallypride. Turning performance in the patients with PD as a measure of postural control and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores pre-exercise and postexercise were determined. Our data showed an exercise-induced increase in [F-18]fallypride BP as well as improved postural control in patients with PD who exercised. Changes in DA-D2R BP were not observed in patients with PD who did not exercise. These results suggest that exercise can lead to neuroplasticity in dopaminergic signaling and contribute to improved function that may be task specific (postural control) in early-stage PD.

J	Nakao, R; Halldin, C				Nakao, Ryuji; Halldin, Christer			A simplified radiometabolite analysis procedure for PET radioligands using a solid phase extraction with micellar medium	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Positron emission tomography (PET); Solid phase extraction; Micellar eluent; Radiometabolite analysis; Direct plasma analysis	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; METABOLITE ANALYSIS; PLASMA; SUBMICELLAR	A solid phase extraction method has been developed for simple and high-speed direct determination of PET radioligands in plasma. Methods: This methodology makes use of a micellar medium and a solid-phase extraction cartridge for displacement of plasma protein bound radioligand and separation of PET radioligands from their radiometabolites without significant preparation. The plasma samples taken from monkey or human during PET measurements were mixed with a micellar eluent containing an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate and loaded onto SPE cartridges. The amount of radioactivity corresponding to parent radioligand (retained on the cartridge) and its radioactive metabolites (eluted with micellar eluent) was measured. Results: Under the optimized conditions, excellent separation of target PET radioligands from their radiometabolites was achieved with a single elution and short run-time of 1 mm. This method was successfully applied to study the metabolism for C-11-labelled radioligands in human or monkey plasma. The amount of parent PET radioligands estimated by micellar solid phase extraction strongly corresponded with that determined by radio-LC. The improved throughput permitted the analysis of a large number of plasma samples (up to 13 samples per one PET study) for accurate estimation of metabolite-corrected input function during quantitative PET imaging studies. Conclusion: Solid phase extraction together with micellar medium is fast, sensitive and easy to use, and therefore it is an attractive alternative method to determine relative composition of PET radioligands in plasma.

Sample Population-Segments of longitudinal and circular smooth muscle from the ileum of 8 male and 8 female adult horses. Procedure-Distribution of alpha -adrenoceptor subtypes was assessed by use of radioligand binding assays incorporating [H-3]-prazosin and [H-3]-rauwolscine, highly selective alpha (1)- and alpha (2)-adrenoceptor antagonists, respectively. Characterization of adrenoceptor subtypes was performed by use of binding inhibition assays. Results-On the basis of binding affinity for specific radioligands, low- and high-affinity alpha (1)- and alpha (2)-adrenoceptors were detected. Concentration of low-affinity alpha (2)-adrenoceptors was significantly greater in male horses, compared with females. Competition studies confirmed the specificity of the radioligands used in the binding assays. alpha (1)-Adrenoceptors of both subtypes in male and female horses had a higher affinity for prazosin than phentolamine, whereas yohimbine did not compete with the radioligand for binding. For alpha (2)-adrenoceptors regardless of subtype, potency of inhibition elicited by each drug varied between sexes. In males, yohimbine was a more potent inhibitor than phentolamine, which was more potent than prazosin, In females, yohimbine was more potent than prazosin, which was more potent than phentolamine. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-High- and low-affinity alpha (1)- and alpha (2)-adrenoceptors were detected in smooth muscle of equine ileum. Because alpha -adrenoceptor subtypes, particularly alpha (2)-adrenoceptors, are involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal tract function, characterization of these receptors may represent the basis for development of new therapeutic strategies for the control of gastrointestinal disturbances in horses.

Irreversible Antagonists for the Adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> Receptor	MOLECULES			English	Article						adenosine; BRET assay; covalent binding; G alpha(15); G protein activation; G protein-coupled receptor; mutagenesis; radioligand binding studies; synthesis; xanthine	SUBTYPE-SELECTIVITY; DERIVATIVES; EFFICACY; AGONISTS; LESSONS; POTENT	Blockade of the adenosine A(2B) receptor (A(2B)AR) represents a potential novel strategy for the immunotherapy of cancer. In the present study, we designed, synthesized, and characterized irreversible A(2B)AR antagonists based on an 8-p-sulfophenylxanthine scaffold. Irreversible binding was confirmed in radioligand binding and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer(BRET)-based G alpha(15) protein activation assays by performing ligand wash-out and kinetic experiments. p-(1-Propylxanthin-8-yl)benzene sulfonyl fluoride (6a, PSB-21500) was the most potent and selective irreversible A(2B)AR antagonist of the present series with an apparent K-i value of 10.6 nM at the human A(2B)AR and >38-fold selectivity versus the other AR subtypes. The corresponding 3-cyclopropyl-substituted xanthine derivative 6c (PSB-21502) was similarly potent, but was non-selective versus A(1)- and A(2A) ARs. Attachment of a reactive sulfonyl fluoride group to an elongated xanthine 8-substituent (12, K-i 7.37 nM) resulted in a potent, selective, reversibly binding antagonist. Based on previous docking studies, the lysine residue K269(7.32) was proposed to react with the covalent antagonists. However, the mutant K269L behaved similarly to the wildtype A(2B)AR, indicating that 6a and related irreversible A(2B)AR antagonists do not interact with K269(7.32). The new irreversible A(2B)AR antagonists will be useful tools and have the potential to be further developed as therapeutic drugs.

The inactivation of the protein was followed by monitoring changes in radioligand-specific binding. We found that the process followed a rate equation with first-order kinetics and was characterized by having a single rate constant k (inact). The activation energies (E (a)) that were calculated from the Arrhenius plots (ln k (inact) vs. 1/T) were 43 +/- A 5 and 45 +/- A 6 kJ/mol for the rat (rDAT) and mouse (mDAT) transporters, respectively, and 44 +/- A 7 kJ/mol for rDAT from PC-6.3 cell line. These E (a) values were similar to the E (a) values of thermal inactivation of the muscarinic receptor from rat brain cortex and to the thermal inactivation of other transmembrane proteins. However, all of these activation energy values were significantly lower than the E (a) values for soluble single-subunit proteins of similar size. These results therefore suggest that the thermal stability of transmembrane proteins may be governed to a significant extent by cell membrane properties and by interactions between the membrane components and the protein. In contrast, the stability of soluble proteins seems to be mostly governed by protein structure and size, which determine the sum of the stabilizing intramolecular interactions within the protein molecule. It is therefore not surprising that cell membrane properties and composition may have significant effects on the functional properties of transmembrane proteins.

We, therefore, examined the production of somatostatin and cortistatin, the expression and distribution of somatostatin receptors (sst) in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, and the possible antiproliferative effect of octreotide on these cells. Methods: Radioimmunoassay and RT-PCR studies were performed for the detection of somatostatin and cortistatin. RT-PCR, radioligand binding and immunocytochemistry assays were employed for the detection of the ssts. Growth and viability of cells were measured by the tetrazolium salt assay. Results: HepG2 cells were found to express sst(2), sst(3) and sst(5) receptors. Immunocytochemistry revealed a mainly intracellular distribution of all ssts with unique patterns for each of them. Membrane binding sites for somatostatin were mainly of the sst(3) (39+/-8%) and sst(5) (59+/-5%) types, while only minor sst(2) binding could be detected (5+/-12%). Octreotide was found to inhibit the proliferation of HepG2 cells (IC50 1.25x10(-9) M) via protein tyrosine phosphatases. HepG2 cells produced cortistatin while somatostatin expression was not detected. Conclusions: In conclusion, HepG2 cells express cortistatin, which regulates somatostatin receptors. Cell proliferation was reduced by octreotide via a protein tyrosine phosphatase dependent mechanism. (C) 2004 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier B.V.

This radioligand allows the comparison of AhR-ligand interactions using a ligand that differs in AhR affinity, and yet has the same radiospecific activity as [I-125]2-iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin. Specific binding of [I-125]4'-iodoflavone with the AhR was detected as a single radioactive peak (-9.7 S) following density sucrose gradient analysis. Cytosolic extracts from both Hepa 1 and HeLa cells were used as the source of mouse and human AhR, respectively. A similar to6.7 S form of radioligand-bound Ah receptor was detected in the high salt nuclear extracts of both cell lines. In HeLa cells approximately twofold more [I-125]4'-iodoflavone-AhR 6 S complex, compared with [I-125]2-iodo-7,8-dibromodibenzo-p-dioxin, was recovered in nuclear extracts. A comparison of the ability of 4'-iodoflavone and TCDD to cause time-dependent translocation of AhR-yellow fluorescent protein revealed that 4'-iodoflavone was more efficient at enhancing nuclear accumulation of the receptor. These results suggest that [I-125]4'-iodoflavone is a particularly useful and easily synthesized ligand for studying the AhR. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In the present study, we have employed [H-3](2S,4R)-4-methylglutamate to examine low affinity kainate receptor distribution in mouse brain. [H-3](2S,4R)-4-Methylglutamate labelled a single site in murine cerebrocortical membranes (K-d = 9.9 +/- 2.7 nM, B-max = 296.3 +/- 27.1 fmol mg protein(-1)). The binding of 8 nM [H-3](2S,4R)-4-methylglutamate was displaced by several non-NMDA receptor ligands (K-i +/- S.E.M.): domoate (1.1 +/- 0.2 nM) > kainate (7.1 +/- 1.1 nM) much greater than L-glutamate (187.6 +/- 31.9 nM) much greater than (S)-alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA) (> 50 muM). [H-3](2S,4R)-4-Methylglutamate autoradiography revealed a widespread regional distribution of low affinity kainate receptors. Highest binding densities occurred within deep layers of the cerebral cortex, olfactory bulb, basolateral amygdala and hippocampal CA3 subregion. Moderate labelling was also evident in the nucleus accumbens, dentate gyrus, caudate putamen, hypothalamus and cerebellar granule cell layer. These data show that [H-3](2S,4R)-4-methylglutamate is a useful radioligand for selectively labelling low affinity kainate receptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In a recent positron emission tomography (PET) study we labelled the cocaine analogue beta -CIT-FE with carbon-11 and demonstrated high specific binding in the monkey striatum. In the present study, the selectivity of [C-11]beta -CIT-FE binding in the primate brain was examined by pretreatment experiments with reference ligands for the dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine transporter. In three healthy human subjects the regional binding of [C-11]beta -CIT-FE was analysed using equilibrium and kinetic analyses. A Scatchard analysis showed that [C-11]beta -CIT-FE bound in a saturable manner yielded a density value of the same order as that reported in vitro. The pharmacological characterization indicated that a high degree of [C-11]-CIT-FE binding in the primate striatum represents the dopamine transporter. In human subjects the radioligand provided high brain up take and reached peak equilibrium within I hour after i.v, injection. Different quantitative approaches gave similar values for the binding potential. The results support the view that [C-11]beta -CIT-FE is a suitable radioligand for clinical studies of the dopamine transporter. In particular for studies requiring short data acquisition or repeated PET measurements on the same day.

METHODS Muscarinic receptors in homogenates of bladder mucosa, detrusor muscle, and parotid gland were measured using the radioligand [(3)H]NMS. 4-DAMP mustard was used to inactivate M(3) receptors irreversibly. RESULTS Specific [(3)H]NMS binding in the homogenates of the mucosa and detrusor muscle was saturable and of high affinity as shown by dissociation constants (K(d)) of 260 +/- 82 and 237 +/- 49 pM, respectively. Antimuscarinic agents (oxybutynin, propiverine, tolterodine, and darifenacin) and their active metabolites competed with [(3)H]NMS for the binding sites in the human mucosa in a concentration-dependent manner. These agents exhibited similar affinity in the detrusor muscle. The B(max). values of [(3)H]NMS in the detrusor, bladder mucosa, and parotid gland were significantly decreased by pretreatment with 4-DAMP mustard (36%, 41% and 63%, respectively). CONCLUSION The density and binding affinity profile of the muscarinic receptor population in the human bladder mucosa was shown to be similar to that of the detrusor muscle. The density of the M(3) subtype in the mucosa was similar to that in the detrusor muscle but lower than that in the parotid gland. UROLOGY 78: 721.e7-721.e12, 2011.

Two techniques have been commonly used to measure drug receptor occupancy. In one method, the drug and the radioligand used to measure occupancy compete in vivo while in the other method, the drug is injected into the living animal, the animal killed and the radioligand competes for available receptors ex vivo. While these methods are often used interchangeably, there has been no systematic comparison of their sensitivities and consistency. Objectives. In this study, we performed a systematic within-animal comparison of drug-induced receptor occupancy as measured by the in vivo vs the ex vivo methods. Methods: We examined the occupancy of dopamine D-2 receptors by different doses of the drug raclopride using the in vivo and and ex vivo autoradiographic methods in the same rat with C-11-raclopride and H-3-raclopride as radioligands, respectively. Results: The in vivo method showed a significantly greater sensitivity and internal consistency while the ex vivo method was less sensitive, and increasingly so as a function of longer incubation times. The lack of sensitivity was accounted for by the unidirectional, dissociation of the drug from the receptors in the incubation medium. Conclusions: Our-data suggest that these two methods are not interchangeable; the ex. vivo method is much less sensitive, lacks internal consistency and hence is best avoided.

Polyarginine Peptides As a New Class of Ligands of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors	DOKLADY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS			English	Article								Arginine-containing peptides R3, R8, and R16 were obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis, and their binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) of muscle and neuronal (7) types was studied by competitive radioligand assay with the use of I-125--bungarotoxin. The resulting peptides exhibited a significantly greater binding activity with respect to the muscle-type nAChRs than to the 7 receptor. Thus, we have discovered a new class of nAChR ligands. The affinity of the synthesized oligoarginines for nAChR depended on the number of amino acid residues in the chain. The highest affinity was exhibited by the R16 peptide, which contained 16 arginine residues.	[Kryukova, E. V.; Ivanov, I. A.; Lebedev, D. S.; Spirova, E. N.; Senko, D. A.; Egorova, N.

Decreased Cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> Receptors in Male Tobacco Smokers Examined With Positron Emission Tomography	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Addiction; Brain imaging; Cannabinoid CB1 receptor; Positron emission tomography; Smoking; Tobacco	NICOTINE EXPOSURE; DOPAMINE RELEASE; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; COCAINE; ETHANOL	BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed reduction of brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors in adults with cannabis and alcohol use disorders. Preclinical data suggest that these receptors also contribute to nicotine reward and dependence. Tobacco smoking may confound clinical studies of psychiatric disorders because many patients with such disorders smoke tobacco. Whether human subjects who smoke tobacco but are otherwise healthy have altered CB1 receptor binding in brain is unknown. METHODS: We measured CB1 receptors in brains of 18 healthy men who smoke tobacco (frequent chronic cigarette smokers), and 28 healthy men who do not smoke tobacco, using positron emission tomography and [F-18]FMPEP-d(2), a radioligand for CB1 receptors. We collected arterial blood samples during scanning to calculate the distribution volume (V-T), which is nearly proportional to CB1 receptor density. Repeated-measures analysis of variance compared V-T between groups in various brain regions. RESULTS: Brain CB1 receptor V-T was about 20% lower in subjects who smoke tobacco than in subjects who do not. Decreased V-T was found in all brain regions, but reduction did not correlate with years of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, or measures of nicotine dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco-smoking healthy men have a widespread reduction of CB1 receptor density in brain. Reduction of CB1 receptors appears to be a common feature of substance use disorders. Future clinical studies on the CB1 receptor should control for tobacco smoking.

In search of novel ligands using a structure-based approach: a case study on the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN			English	Article						Adenosine A(2A) receptor; Virtual screening; Explicit water; Novel ligand; Diverse chemical space	VIRTUAL SCREENING ENRICHMENTS; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; DRUG-LIKE MOLECULES; FINGERPRINT METHODS; DATA FUSION; ANTAGONISTS; DESIGN; DATABASE; DISCOVERY; DOCKING	In this work, we present a case study to explore the challenges associated with finding novel molecules for a receptor that has been studied in depth and has a wealth of chemical information available. Specifically, we apply a previously described protocol that incorporates explicit water molecules in the ligand binding site to prospectively screen over 2.5 million drug-like and lead-like compounds from the commercially available eMolecules database in search of novel binders to the adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)AR). A total of seventy-one compounds were selected for purchase and biochemical assaying based on high ligand efficiency and high novelty (Tanimoto coefficient aecurrency sign0.25 to any A(2A)AR tested compound). These molecules were then tested for their affinity to the adenosine A(2A) receptor in a radioligand binding assay. We identified two hits that fulfilled the criterion of similar to 50 % radioligand displacement at a concentration of 10 mu M. Next we selected an additional eight novel molecules that were predicted to make a bidentate interaction with Asn253(6.55), a key interacting residue in the binding pocket of the A(2A)AR. None of these eight molecules were found to be active. Based on these results we discuss the advantages of structure-based methods and the challenges associated with finding chemically novel molecules for well-explored targets.

The functional response to activation of a G protein-coupled receptor is usually measured at a point downstream from receptor activation in the signaling pathway, and the effects of allosteric modulation on the response can be attributed to scalar changes in the observed affinity (alpha) and intrinsic efficacy (beta) of the agonist-receptor complex. If the concentration-response curve of the agonist is measured in the absence and presence of a range of concentrations of the allosteric modulator, then it is always possible to estimate the affinity constant of the modulator (K-2) and the product (gamma) of the modulatory changes in the observed affinity and efficacy of the agonist-receptor complex (gamma=alpha beta). In many instances, it is impossible through analysis of receptor function only to determine the alpha and beta components of the modulation. Regardless, the parameter gamma is unique in that it represents the ratio of the microscopic affinity constants of the modulator for the active and inactive states of the receptor in situations where there is one orthosteric activation site directly linked to the allosteric site. Radioligand binding assays can be used to estimate affinity modulation between the allosteric modulator and the orthosteric radioligand or another nonlabeled orthosteric ligand. By measuring allosterism in both functional and binding assays, it is possible to measure the affinity and efficacy components of allosteric modulation.

The present study characterized the tissue distributions of ACE and NEP, and assessed the effects of the vasopeptidase inhibitor omapatrilat on ACE and NEP in rat tissues. In vivo ACE and NEP inhibition was studied by in vitro autoradiography and using the ACE inhibitor radioligand I-125-MK35IA and the NEP inhibitor radioligand I-125-RB104 in rats that received oral omapatrilat (40 mg . day(-1) . kg(-1)) for 3 days. In vitro autoradiography was used to examine the distribution of ACE and NEP in the kidney, aorta, heart, adrenal gland, lung, intestine, liver, spleen and brain, and to assess enzyme inhibition after oral omapatrilat. Omapatrilat inhibited plasma ACE and increased plasma renin activity (P < 0.01). Tissue ACE was inhibited by 70-95 % (P < 0.01), except in the brain, where ACE was not inhibited. NEP was inhibited by 87 % in the kidney and by 20-40 % in atria, aorta, adrenal gland, lung, liver and intestine; it was not inhibited in the brain, the ventricle or the spleen. Omapatrilat is a potent vasopeptidase inhibitor that significantly inhibits tissue ACE and NEP, with the degree of inhibition varying according to the enzyme and the tissue under assessment. The degree and site of tissue enzyme inhibition by vasopeptidase inhibitors may be relevant to end-organ protection as well as to the side-effect profiles of these agents.

[H-3]-N-methyl scopolamine (NMS) in the presence of muscarinic antagonists and Mamba venom to occlude different receptor subtypes was used as radioligand. Analysis of [H-3]-NMS binding curves without receptor subtype assessment resulted in a slight decrease of receptor density in AD patients. Evaluation of receptor subtypes in MCIAT and AD patients revealed a decrease of M3 receptor by more than 50%, an increase of M4 receptor expression by about 20% and no changes of M2 or M5 receptors. The expression of M2-M5 receptors was unaltered in VaD patients. Strong positive and negative correlations respectively were found between the density of lymphocyte M3 and N14 receptors and MMSE score in both MCIAT (0.78 for M3 receptor and 0.80 for M4 receptor) and AD (0.82 for M3 receptor and 0.83 for M4 receptor) patients. These findings suggest that changes in the expression of peripheral blood lymphocyte M3 and M4 receptors in AD are related to the degree of cognitive impairment. Assessment of lymphocyte muscarinic receptor subtypes may contribute to characterization of cholinergic impairment in AD. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Severe Thrombocytopenia in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumor Treated With Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy	CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neuroendocrine; tumor; PRRT; adverse; cytopenia	RADIOLABELED SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; BONE METASTASES; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; SCINTIGRAPHY; PRRT; LU-177-DOTATATE; TOXICITY; SURVIVAL; LU-177-OCTREOTATE	Background Peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) was Food and Drug Administration approved in 2018 for the treatment of unresectable somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and provides an important option for patients with advanced disease. A known adverse effect of this treatment is hematologic toxicity, although usually transient. We present 3 patients with metastatic gastroenteropancreatic NETs treated with PRRT who were evaluated for severe persistent thrombocytopenia. Methods Three patients who commenced therapy with PRRT were known to proceed to a bone marrow (BM) biopsy for persistent severe thrombocytopenia and were included in this study. These patients were identified retrospectively and evaluated for their tumor properties, including immunohistochemical markers, treatment modalities, and clinical outcomes. Results All 3 patients had metastatic NETs that progressed on prior lines of therapy and were treated with 1 to 4 doses of Lu-177-DOTATATE 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) before developing grade 3 (25,000 to 50,000/mu L) refractory thrombocytopenia. All patients had concurrent bone metastases, and 2 of the 3 had baseline grade 1 thrombocytopenia. In all 3 cases, BM biopsy documented widespread tumor infiltration. Conclusions Severe refractory thrombocytopenia after PRRT is rare and may result from numerous known causes, including radiation-induced myelotoxicity, myelodysplastic syndrome, and tumor BM infiltration. We present 3 cases of thrombocytopenia related to persistent or progressive BM metastasis. Although known bone metastasis is not a contraindication to PRRT, thrombocytopenia may be a manifestation of tumor progression and should be considered when making decisions about continuation of therapy.

Prognostic significance and clinical relevance of the expression of the HER family of type I receptor tyrosine kinases in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma; Type I receptor tyrosine kinases; Quantitative immunohistochemistry; Radioligand binding assay; Prognosis	GROWTH-FACTOR-RECEPTOR; CANCER; HEAD; EGFR; C-ERBB-2; SURVIVAL; HER4; HER-2/NEU; MARKERS; P53	Introduction: The full clinical relevance of the expression pattern of HER family of type I receptor tyrosine kinases in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma remains to be elucidated. We evaluated the clinical relevance of such parameter in our population. Patients and methods: This study examined the expression pattern of HER family receptor members by quantitative immunohistochemistry and the amount of the EGF binding sites by a radioligand binding assay, in the same group of 67 LSCC patients, analysing the correlation between the expression of the four HER receptors and the clinical and prognostic parameters. Results: HER1 levels inversely correlated with that of HER2-4, while HER2-4 directly correlated among them. Cox univariate analysis using HER1-4 values as continuous covariates indicated that HER1 expression was directly associated with the risk of death and relapse while that of HER2-4 was inversely associated with the risk of death. Among the patients with high HER1 expressing tumours, those with tumours co-expressing HER2-4 showed a lower risk of death and relapse (in particular regional relapse) than those with tumours displaying a negative HER2-4 status. Conclusions: The evaluation of HER2-4 status adds more power to the prognostic role of HER1 detection. In the era of molecularly targeted therapy, the expression of HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases in LSCC may hold relevant clinical significance and turn out to be a key factor in prognostic assessment and in treatment planning.

Recently, a novel radioligand, C-11-N, N-diethyl-2-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,7dimethyl-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl]-acetamide (C-11-DPA-713), has been described that binds to TSPO with high affinity. Here, we report the first examination of C-11-DPA-713 in human subjects using PET. Methods: Five healthy controls were studied with PET for 90 min after a bolus injection of high-specific-activity C-11-DPA-713. For comparison, 2 additional healthy controls were studied with C-11-R-PK11195. Arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis were performed to allow the accurate quantification of tracer kinetics. Tracer uptake was evaluated for several brain regions. Tissue time-activity curves were fitted using 1- and 2-tissue-compartment-models, with goodness-of-fit tests showing a preference for the 2-tissue model. Results: In the healthy brain, the average plasma-to-tissue clearance and the total volume of distribution were an order of magnitude larger than measured for C-11-R-PK11195. Accordingly, dose-normalized time -activity curves showed that C-11-DPA-713 gives a larger brain signal. Conclusion: Studies in patient populations will help determine whether C-11-DPA-713 provides better sensitivity for evaluating increased TSPO expression. This initial study in humans shows that C-11-DPA-713 is a promising ligand for evaluating TSPO binding with PET.

Quick and simple synthesis of <SUP>11</SUP>C-(+)-α-dihydrotetrabenazine to be used as a pet radioligand of vesicular monoamine transporters	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR			Spanish	Article						C-11-(+)dihydrotetrabenazine; monoamine transporters VMAT2; positron emission tomography; synthesis	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TETRABENAZINE-BINDING; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; C-11 TETRABENAZINE; MOUSE-BRAIN; VESICLES; INVIVO; SITE	Dihydrotetrabenazine (2-hydroxy-3-isobutyl-9,10-dimethoxy-1,3,4,6,7-hexahydro-11bH-benzo[a]-quinolizine, DTBZ) has become the ideal radioligand for the presynaptic vesicular monoamine transporter VMAT2 based on its high binding affinity and optimal lipophilicity. Objective. To develop an automatic procedure for labelling DTBZ with carbon-11, which has been shown to be a highly effective marker for in vivo studies of neuronal losses in animal models with Parkinson's disease using positron emission tomography (PET). Materials and methods. We have developed a new fully automated synthesis procedure to obtain C-11-(+)DTBZ quickly and simply through labelling the precursor -(+)desmethyldihydrotetrabenazine- at room temperature in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and potassium hydroxide (KOH), using (CH3I)-C-11 as primary precursor. The final purification was carried out by solid phase extraction using commercially available cartridges and the residual solvents (DMSO and ethyl ether) were eliminated by evaporation. Results. The whole procedure was automated, and after 54 syntheses, an average production of 1.94 GBq of sterile, pyrogen-free C-11-(+)DTBZ with a radiochemical purity > 99% was obtained with 5 minutes irradiation and 6 minutes of synthesis after (CH3I)-C-11 production. C-11-(+)DTBZ binding to presynaptic dopamine nerve terminals has been demonstrated by MicroPET studies in Wistar rats and M. Fascicularis monkeys. Conclusions. This new synthesis procedure is quick and simple, due to optimised techniques, which have allowed elimination of residual solvents based on their polarity for the final purification. It is also applicable to other automatic syntheses for obtaining compounds labelled by methylation reactions.	[Quincoces, G.; Collantes, M.; Catalan, R.; Ecay, M.; Prieto, E.; Martino, E.; Blesa, F.

Here we used radioligand binding of [H-3]MK-801 to a membrane preparation from rat cerebral cortex to investigate the interactions of these compounds with the NMDA receptor complex. In the absence of exogenous polyamines, agmatine reduced [H-3]MK-801 binding only at concentrations over 500 muM, as opposed to the putative polyamine-site antagonists arcaine and ifenprodil which directly reduce ligand binding at much lower concentrations (5 muM) in the absence of polyamines. In our studies, all three compounds significantly reduced spermidine-potentiated [H-3]MK-801 binding, however agmatine was the only compound effective at concentrations below those that produced direct inhibition of [H-3]MK-801 binding. Under these conditions, agmatine had a K-i = 14.8 muM for spermidine-potentiated [H-3]MK-801 binding and displayed characteristics of a competitive antagonist. Agmatine, as well as ifenprodil and arcaine, also displaced [H-3]spermidine from rat cortical membranes at concentrations similar to those that were effective at reducing spermidine-potentiated [H-3]MK-801 binding. In conclusion, these data suggest that agmatine reduces the potentiating effects of polyamines by competitive antagonism at a specific site on the NMDA receptor complex, and that these actions of agmatine differ from those of ifenprodil and arcaine.

There is now greater clarity on the role of the use of immunotherapies in renal cell carcinoma. The use of triplet combinations with immune checkpoint inhibition with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the front-line setting for metastatic disease (COSMIC313) has been explored. The use of adjuvant therapy has been complicated by a series of negative immune therapy trials. Promising results with the HIF-2a transcription factor inhibitor, belzutifan, alone or in combination with other agents, have been reported. Antibody drug conjugates, including enfortumab vedotin and sacituzumab govitecan, have continued to show activity in urothelial cancer with promising clinical outcomes. This has led to further exploration of the combination of these novel agents with immunotherapy and accelerated Food and Drug Administration approvals. Data are also discussed regarding intensification for front-line therapy of metastatic castrate sensitive prostate cancer. The combination of androgen-signaling inhibitors, docetaxel, and androgen deprivation therapy (PEACE-1, ARASENS), as well as the use of abiraterone acetate for adjuvant therapy in high-risk disease (STAMPEDE), is included. There is also growing evidence for the use of the radioligand therapy Lu-177-PSMA-617 in metastatic castrate resistant disease, with an established overall survival benefit in this patient population (VISION, TheraP).

Materials and Methods: Primary human prostate stromal explants were infected with an amphotrophic retrovirus encoding the E6/E7 open reading frame of the human papillomavirus type 16. Immunohistochemistry was used to verify the expression of prostate stromal markers. alpha1-Adrenergic receptor expression was investigated using ribonuclease protection assays and radioligand binding. Cell proliferation was measured by the WST-1 dagger assay and cell counting. Results: Clonal isolates of individual prostate stromal cells were isolated and passed in selection media. E6 and E7 expression was verified using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in the selected cell line. The new prostate stromal cell line PS30 was established which maintains the expression of alpha -smooth muscle actin and expresses 22 fmol./mg. of protein of alpha -adrenergic receptors, approximately equal to native human prostate alpha1-adrenergic receptor expression. However, at a subtype level alpha 1a-adrenergic receptor expression is down-regulated and not detectable by ribonuclease protection assays or radioligand binding, while alpha 1b and alpha 1d-adrenergic receptor expression is enhanced. From a physiological prospective PS30 cells do not form tumors in nude mice and stimulation with phenylephrine does not increase cell proliferation. Conclusions: We successfully established and characterized an in vitro human prostate stromal cell line. This cell line should facilitate studies designed to characterize the role of the adrenergic nervous system in the regulation of prostate growth.

Validation of an extracerebral reference region approach for the quantification of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in squirrel monkeys with PET and 2-<SUP>18</SUP>F-fluoro-A-85380	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; nonhuman primates; radioligand; in vivo binding; nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; BLOOD-VOLUME; BINDING; LIGAND; RADIOLIGAND	The aim of the present study was to explore the applicability of an extracerebral reference region for the quantification of cerebral receptors with PET. Methods: Male squirrel monkeys underwent quantitative PET studies of cerebral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with 2-F-18-fluoro-A-85380 (2-FA). Data from dynamic PET scans were analyzed with various compartment- and non-compartment-based models, including a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). Nondisplaceable volume-of-distribution (VDnd) values were determined in regions of interest after the blockade of 2-FA-specific binding by nicotine infusion. Binding potential values, estimated with the cerebellum and muscle as reference regions, were compared and the reproducibility of measurements was determined. Results: One- and 2-tissue compartment modeling and linear graphic analysis provided similar total volume-of-distribution (VDT) values for each studied region. VDT values were high in the thalamus, intermediate in the cortex and midbrain, and low in the cerebellum and muscle, consistent with the distribution pattern of nAChR containing alpha(4) and beta(2) receptor subunits (alpha(4)beta(2)*). The administration of nicotine at 2 mg/kg/d via an osmotic pump resulted in a nearly complete saturation of 2-FA-specific binding and led to very small changes in volumes of distribution in the cerebellum and muscle (-9% +/- 4% [mean +/- SEMI and 0% +/- 6%, respectively), suggesting limited specific binding of the radioligand in these areas. VDT measured in muscle in 15 monkeys was reasonably constant (3.0 +/- 0.2, with a coefficient of variation of 8%). VDnd in studied brain regions exceeded VDT in muscles by a factor of 1.3. With this factor and with muscle as a reference region, BP* values calculated for studied brain regions with the SRTM were in good agreement with those obtained with the cerebellum as a reference region. Significant correlations were observed between BP* values estimated with these 2 approaches. The reproducibilities of BP* measurements obtained with the 2 methods were comparable, with coefficients of variation of less than 11% and 13% for the thalamus and the cortex, respectively. Conclusion: These results suggest that the accurate quantification of nAChRs can be performed with 2-FA and a reference region outside the brain, providing a novel approach for the quantification of brain receptors when no suitable cerebral reference region is available.

C-11 was introduced by O-methylation of the corresponding des-methyl precursor, namely CGP67780. The final product was obtained with a reliable method in good yield. The radioligand was tested in monkey, revealing negligible blood brain barrier penetration and brain uptake, thus prompting us to search for a new target structure with a better lipophilicity.

The proximal alkyne was intended to promote receptor recognition, and the distal alkyne reacted with azides to form triazole derivatives (click cycloaddition). Click chemistry was utilized to couple an octadiynyl A(3)AR agonist to azido-containing fluorescent, chemically reactive, biotinylated, and other moieties with retention of selective binding to the A(3)AR. A bifunctional thiol-reactive crosslinking reagent was introduced. The most potent and selective novel compound was a 1-adamantyl derivative (K-i 6.5 nM), although some of the click products had K-i values in the range of 200-400 nM. Other potent, selective derivatives (K-i at A(3)AR in nM) were intended as possible receptor affinity labels: 3-nitro-4-fluorophenyl (10.6), alpha-bromophenacyl (9.6), thiol-reactive isothiazolone (102), and arylisothiocyanate (37.5) derivatives. The maximal functional effects in inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP were measured, indicating that this class of click adducts varied from partial to full A(3)AR agonist compared to other widely used agonists. Thus, this strategy provides a general chemical approach to linking potent and selective A(3)AR agonists to reporter groups of diverse structure and to carrier moieties. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells express Nociceptin/Orphanin FQ, but not μ, δ, or κ opioid receptors	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							INFLAMMATORY PAIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; BETA-ENDORPHIN; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IMMUNE CELLS; T-CELLS; MORPHINE; LYMPHOCYTES; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION	BACKGROUND: Expression of opioid receptors on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is controversial. These receptors are currently classified as classical (MOP/mu/mu, DOP/delta/delta and KOP/kappa/kappa) and nonclassical NOP (nociceptin/orphanin FQ; N/OFQ). METHODS: In this volunteer study we probed for the expression of both classical and nonclassical opioid receptors using 1) radioligand binding, 2) specific antibody binding, and 3) polymerase chain reaction-based experimental paradigms. RESULTS: Membranes prepared from PBMC from healthy volunteers did not bind either [H-3]diprenorphine (a nonselective radioligand for classical opioid receptors) or [H-3]N/OFQ. There was significant concentration-dependent binding of each ractioligand to control tissues expressing recombinant MOP and NOP. In addition, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting paradigms, there was no binding of fluorescent naloxone or either of two MOP antibodies to whole PBMC, though fluorescent naloxone did bind to recombinant MOP (as a positive control). Using primers specific for classical and nonclassical opioid receptors, and RNA extracted from the PBMC of 10 healthy volunteers, we were also unable to detect MOP, DOP, and KOP transcripts. in contrast, NOP was detected in all samples. CONCLUSIONS: Despite using several complementary experimental strategies, we failed to demonstrate protein for classical or nonclassical opioid receptors on PBMC from healthy volunteers. We detected NOP mRNA, suggesting low-density NOP expression on these immunocytes. It is possible that N/OFQ, produced by the PBMC itself, may be involved in the control of immune function.

MNPA is a selective D2-like receptor agonist with a high affinity (K-i=0.17 nM). [C-11]MNPA was successfully synthesized by direct O-methylation of(R)-2-hydroxy-NPA using [C-11]methyl iodide and was evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. This study included baseline PET experiments and a pretreatment study using unlabeled raclopride (1 mg/kg). High uptake of radioactivity was seen in regions known to contain high D2R, with a maximum striatum-to-cerebellum ratio of 2.23 +/- 0.21 at 78 min and a maximum thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio of 1.37 +/- 0.06 at 72 min. The pretreatment study demonstrated high specific binding to D2R by reducing the striatum-to-cerebellum ratio to 1.26 at 78 min. This preliminary study indicates that the dopamine agonist [C-11]MNPA has potential as an agonist radioligand for the D-2-like receptor and has potential for examination of the high-affinity state of the D2R in human subjects and patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

In competitive inhibition studies, (+)pIV (K-i = 1.30 nM) had more than 10 times higher affinity to the sigma-1 ((sigma-1) receptor than (+)-pentazoeine (K-i = 19.9 nM) or haloperidol (K-i = 13.5 nM) known as sigma ligands. Also, the binding affinity of (+)-pIV for the sigma-1 receptor (K-i = 1.30 nM), was about 16 times higher than the sigma-2 ((sigma-2) receptor (K-i = 20.4 nM). (+)-pIV (K-i = 1260 nM) had a much lower affinity for VAChT than (-)-vesamicol (K-i = 13.0 nM) or (-)-pIV (K-i = 412 nM). (+)-[ (125)]pIV had low affinity for the dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, and acetylcholine receptors. Furthermore, in a saturation binding study, (+)-[I-125]pIV exhibited a K-d of 6.96 nM with a B-max of 799 fmol/ mg of protein. These results showed that (+)-pIV binds to the (sigma-1 receptor with greater affinity than sigma receptor ligands such as (+)-pentazocine or haloperidol, and that radioiodinated (+)-pIV is suitable as radiotracer for (sigma-1 receptor studies in vitro.

While 2b and its 3-pyridyl analogue 2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(3-pyridyl)-4-isoxazolyl]propionic acid (3-Py-AMPA, 3) show very low affinity for AMPA receptors, introduction of heteroaryl substituents containing heteroatom in the 2-position provides potent AMPA receptor agonists. We here report the synthesis and pharmacology of 2-amino-3- (3-hydroxy-5-pyrazinyl-4- isoxazolyl)propionic acid (7) (IC50 = 1.2 muM: EC50 = 11 muM), which is weaker as an AMPA agonist than AMPA (IC50 = 0.040 muM: EC50 = 3.5 muM) but comparable in potency with 2-Py-AMPA (4) (IC50 = 0.57 muM; EC50 = 7.4 muM), as determined in radioligand binding and electrophysiological experiments, respectively. The AMPA analogues 8a-c, containing 2-, 3-, or 4-methoxyphenyl substituents, respectively, and the corresponding hydroxyphenyl analogues. 9a-c, were also synthesized and evaluated pharmacologically. With the exception of 2-amino-3- [3-hydroxy-5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-isoxazolyl]propionic acid (9a), which is a very weak AMPA agonist (IC50 = 45 muM; EC50 = 324 muM), none of these compounds showed detectable effect at AMPA receptors.

Parameters are estimated in a compartmental framework using an over-complete exponential basis set and sparse Bayesian learning. The technique is applicable to analyses requiring either a plasma or reference tissue input function and produces estimates of the system's macro-parameters and model order. In addition, the Bayesian approach returns the posterior distribution which allows for some characterisation of the error component. The method is applied to the estimation of parametric images of neuroreceptor radioligand studies.	[Peng, Jyh-Ying; Aston, John A.

MAChR subtypes were examined by inhibiting [3H]-NMS binding with subtype selective nonlabelled receptor antagonists. In all left and right atria as well as left and right ventricles of both turkey breeds, the specific [3H]-NMS binding was saturable, reversible and of high affinity (KD range: 0.5-1.0 nM). The maximum receptor density (Bmax) was not significantly different between the four cardiac chambers of BUT Big 6 turkeys, but a significant difference was found between atria and ventricles of Cro center dot llwitzer turkeys. Moreover, significant lower Bmax was found in the atria of Cro center dot llwitzer turkeys than in the atria of BUT Big 6, while the ventricular Bmax was significantly higher. In all cardiac chambers, unlabeled mAChR antagonists competed for specific [3H]-NMS binding sites in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting the presence of the M3 and M2 receptor subtypes, whereby the latter was the predominant subtype. The presence of the M1 subtype could not be excluded. In conclusion, there was a difference between BUT Big 6 ("meat-type") and Cro center dot llwitzer ("wild-type") turkeys with regard to receptor density in heart chambers with dominant M2 and M3 receptor subtypes.

An increasing volume of anecdotal reports and interest in the plant have provoked research into the activity of minor chemical constituents of the plant-including volatile terpenoids such as myrcene, alpha- and beta- pinene, beta-caryophyllene, and limonene. However, to date, no clear interaction has been identified. The current study was designed to determine whether terpenes in the cannabis plant have detectable receptor-mediated activity, or modify the activity of Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonylglycerol at the cannabinoid receptors. In addition, we have utilized a standard radioligand binding paradigm with ability to detect orthosteric and allosteric interactions of test compounds. With the possible exception of a weak interaction of beta-caryophyllene with CB2, no data were produced to support the hypothesis that any of the five terpenes tested (either alone or in mixtures) have direct interactions with CB1 or CB2, as the binding of radioligand ([H-3]-CP55,940), Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, and cannabidiol were unaltered by the presence of terpenes. Similarly, terpene functional effects were also not detected, either alone or in combination with Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, or 2-arachidonoylglycerol. This study adds to the evidence that the putative entourage effect cannot be explained by direct effects at CB1 or CB2.

Low Frequency of Pendrin Autoantibodies Detected Using a Radioligand Binding Assay in Patients With Autoimmune Thyroid Disease	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							SYNDROME TYPE-I; ENZYME AUTOANTIGENS; GENE PDS; VITILIGO; SERA; IMMUNOPRECIPITATION; RADIOIMMUNOASSAY; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; TYROSINASE	Context: Pendrin is a transmembrane protein located at the apical end of the thyrocyte in which it mediates the efflux of iodide through the thyroid follicular cell. Recently pendrin was described as a significant antibody target in Japanese patients with Graves' disease (GD) or autoimmune hypothyroidism (AH) using an immunoblotting assay. However, a subsequent study failed to verify this in autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) patients of Tunisian origin. Objective: The aim of the current study was to evaluate a UK population of patients with ATD for the presence of pendrin autoantibodies using a novel radioligand binding assay (RBA). Results: Sera from 71 GD and 66 AH patients and 28 healthy controls were evaluated for pendrin autoantibody reactivity in RBAs. The results indicated that 8.8% of patients with ATD(9.9% GD and 7.6% AH) were positive for pendrin autoantibodies. Overall, the frequency of pendrin autoantibodies did not differ significantly between the ATD patient cohorts and the healthy control group: P = .186 and P = .317 for GD and AH patients, respectively. Conclusion: Pendrin autoantibodies, detected using a novel RBA, are not widely prevalent in UK patients with ATD, nor do they differ in frequency between GD and AH. These autoantibodies are therefore unlikely to be a useful marker for disease diagnosis, although the role that pendrin may play as an autoantigen in the initiation or maintenance of thyroid autoimmunity remains to be established.

The present study evaluated C-11-LY2428703 for imaging mGluR1 in monkey and human brains. Methods: Rhesus monkeys were imaged at baseline and after administration of an mGluR1 blocking agent to calculate nonspecific binding, as well as after the administration of permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) blockers to assess whether C-11-LY2428703 is a substrate for efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier. Human imaging was performed at baseline in three healthy volunteers, and arterial input function was measured. Results: Overall brain uptake was low in monkeys, though slightly higher in the cerebellum, where mGluR1s are concentrated. However, the uptake was not clearly displaceable in the scans after mGluR1 blockade. Brain penetration of the ligand did not increase after P-gp and BCRP blockade. Brain uptake was similarly low in all human subjects (mean V-T with a two-tissue compartment model, 0.093 +/- 0.012 mL/cm(3)) and for all regions, including the cerebellum. Conclusions: Despite promising in vitro and in vivo results in rodents, C-11-LY2428703 was unsuitable for imaging mGluR1s in monkey or human brain because of low brain uptake, which was likely caused by high binding to plasma proteins.

Decreased Striatal Dopamine Receptor Binding in Primary Focal Dystonia: A D2 or D3 Defect?	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						dystonia; dopamine; NMB; D2-like dopamine receptors; D3 dopamine receptor; PET	DYT1 DYSTONIA; BASAL GANGLIA; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; CAUDATE-PUTAMEN; MESSENGER-RNA; MOUSE MODEL; PET; TRANSMISSION	Dystonia is an involuntary movement disorder characterized by repetitive patterned or sustained muscle contractions causing twisting or abnormal postures. Several lines of evidence suggest that abnormalities of dopaminergic pathways contribute to the pathophysiology of dystonia. In particular, dysfunction of D2-like receptors that mediate function of the indirect pathway in the basal ganglia may play a key role. We have demonstrated with positron emission tomography that patients with primary focal cranial or hand dystonia have reduced putamenal specific binding of [(18)F]spiperone, a nonselective D2-like radioligand with nearly equal affinity for serotonergic 5-HT(2A) sites. We then repeated the study with [(18)F]N-methyl-benperidol (NMB), a more selective D2-like receptor radioligand with minimal affinity for 5-HT(2A). Surprisingly, there was no decrease in NMB binding in the putamen of subjects with dystonia. Our findings excluded reductions of putamenal uptake greater than 20% with 95% confidence intervals. The analysis of the in vitro selectivity of NMB and spiperone demonstrated that NMB was highly selective for D2 receptors relative to D3 receptors (200-fold difference in affinity), whereas spiperone has similar affinity for all three of the D2-like receptor subtypes. These findings when coupled with other literature suggest that a defect in D3, rather than D2, receptor expression may be associated with primary focal dystonia.

Selectivity is species-dependent: Characterization of standard agonists and antagonists at human, rat, and mouse adenosine receptors	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Agonist; Antagonist; Selectivity; Species differences; Potency	PROTEIN-COUPLED ADENOSINE; A(2A) RECEPTOR; XANTHINE DERIVATIVES; INTERNATIONAL UNION; P2Y RECEPTORS; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; AFFINITY; LIGANDS; POTENT	Adenosine receptors (ARs) have emerged as new drug targets. The majority of data on affinity/potency and selectivity of AR ligands described in the literature has been obtained for the human species. However, preclinical studies are mostly performed in mouse or rat, and standard AR agonists and antagonists are frequently used for studies in rodents without knowing their selectivity in the investigated species. In the present study, we selected a set of frequently used standard AR ligands, 8 agonists and 16 antagonists, and investigated them in radioligand binding studies at all four AR subtypes, A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3), of three species, human, rat, and mouse. Recommended, selective agonists include CCPA (for A(1)AR of rat and mouse), CGS-21680 (for A(2A) AR of rat), and Cl-IB-MECA (for A(3)AR of all three species). The functionally selective partial A(2B) agonist BAY60-6583 was found to additionally bind to A(1) and A(3)AR and act as an antagonist at both receptor subtypes. The antagonists PSB-36 (A(1)), preladenant (A(2A)), and PSB-603 (A(2)B) displayed high selectivity in all three investigated species. MRS-1523 acts as a selective A(3)AR antagonist in human and rat, but is only moderately selective in mouse. The comprehensive data presented herein provide a solid basis for selecting suitable AR ligands for biological studies.

We studied microglial reaction in brain areas remote from the primary lesion site in two rodent models of focal cerebral ischaemia (permanent or transient) using [(125)I]-CLINDE, a promising TSPO single photon emission computed tomography radioligand. In a mouse model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), ex vivo autoradiographic studies demonstrated, besides in the ischaemic territory, accumulation of [(125)I]-CLINDE in the ipsilateral thalamus with a binding that progressed up to 3 weeks after MCAO. [(125)I]-CLINDE binding markedly decreased in animals pre-injected with either unlabelled CLINDE or PK11195, while no change was observed with flumazenil pre-treatment, demonstrating TSPO specificity. In rats subjected to transient MCAO, [(125)I]-CLINDE binding in the ipsilateral thalamus and substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) was significantly higher than that in contralateral tissue. Moreover, [(125)I]-CLINDE binding in the thalamus and SNr was quantitatively correlated to the ischaemic volume assessed by MRI in the cortex and striatum, respectively. Clinical consequences of secondary neuronal degeneration in stroke might be better treated thanks to the discrimination of neuronal processes using in vivo molecular imaging and potent TSPO radioligands like CLINDE to guide therapeutic interventions.

Previous behavioral and binding studies from our laboratory using an amphibian model suggested that mu, kappa, or delta opioid agonists may activate a single type of opioid receptor in the grass frog, Rana pipiens. In the present study, kinetic, saturation, and competitive binding profiles for three opioid radioligands, [H-3] DAMGO ([D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]- enkephalin) (mu-selective), [H-3] U65953 [(5alpha, 7alpha,8beta)- (+)-N-methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5] dec8- yl]-benzeneacetamide] (kappa-selective), and [H-3] DPDPE ([D-Pen (2),D-Pen(5)]-enkephalin) (delta-selective) were determined using frog whole brain homogenates. Kinetic analyses and experimentally derived values from saturation experiments gave affinity constants (K-D) in the low nanomolar range. The density of opioid binding sites (B-max) was 224.4, 118.6, and 268.9 fmol/mg for mu, kappa, and delta opioid radioligands, respectively. The affinity values did not significantly differ among the three opioid radioligands, but the kappa radioligand bound to significantly fewer sites than did the mu or delta radioligands. K-i values for unlabeled mu, kappa, and delta competitors, including highly selective opioid antagonists, were consistent with each radioligand selectivity profile. The present data suggest that mu, kappa, and delta opioid radioligands bind to distinct opioid receptors in amphibians that are surprisingly similar to those found in mammalian brain.

We aimed to evaluate whether DDR-markers in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) may have predictive potential for outcome in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients receiving [Lu-177]Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligand therapy (RLT). Methods We prospectively enrolled 20 men with advanced mCRPC scheduled for PSMA-targeted RLT. Prior to the first cycle of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA RLT, all patients underwent [F-18]F-PSMA-1007 positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) for assessment of tumor PSMA expression (assessing maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of all tumor lesions). Blood samples were collected prior to, + 1 h after, and + 24 h after administration of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA, and DDR-markers gamma-H2AX and 53BP1 were determined in PBLs through immunocytofluorescence. We then tested the predictive performance of DDR-markers relative to clinical and PET-based parameters for progressive disease (PSA-PD) after 2 cycles. In addition, the predictive value for progression-free survival (PSA-PFS, provided as median and 95% confidence interval [CI]) was explored. Results Low baseline 53BP1 and gamma-H2AX foci (P = 0.17) tended to predict early PSA-PD, whereas low SUVmax was significantly associated with higher risk for PSA-PD (P = 0.04). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, there was a trend towards prolonged PSA-PFS in patients with higher baseline 53BP1 of 6 months (mo; 95%CI, 4-9 mo) compared to 3 mo in patients with low 53BP1 (95% CI, 2-3 mo; P = 0.12). Comparable results were recorded for higher gamma-H2AX expression (6 mo [95% CI, 3-9 mo] relative to 3 mo [95% CI, 2-4 mo] in patients with low gamma-H2AX; P = 0.12). SUVmax, however, did not demonstrate predictive value (P = 0.29). Consistently, in univariate Cox-regression analysis, baseline 53BP1 foci demonstrated borderline significance for predicting PSA-PFS under [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA RLT (P = 0.05). Conclusion In this prospective study investigating mCRPC patients undergoing [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA RLT, low baseline DDR-markers in PBLs tended to predict poor outcome. Although the study group was small and results need further confirmation, these preliminary findings lay the foundation for exploring additive radiosensitizing or treatment intensification in future studies with high-risk individuals scheduled for RLT.

Radioligand therapy (RLT) can be used as a first or second line of treatment. It is registered in gastroenteropancreatic NENs (GEP-NENs) as grades G1 and G2. Tumors with an unknown point of origin, diagnosed outside the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas (non-GEP) or at the G3 grade, remain in the "grey area" of treatment.Materials and methods: Analysis of 51 patients with NENs who underwent RLT in a single highest reference center from 2018 to 2023 was performed. Treatment was administrated to the patients with neoplasms of unknown origin, non-GEP-NENs, and ones with G3 grade. In total, 35 patients received 177-Lutetium (7.4 GBq), while 16 received 177-Lutetium and 90-Yttrium with equal activities (1.85 + 1.85 GBq).Results: The progression-free survival (PFS) before RLT qualification was 34.39 +/- 35.88 months for the whole study group. In subgroups of patients with an unknown tumor location (n = 25), the median PFS was 19 months (IQR = 23), with "other" locations (n = 21) at 31 months (IQR = 28), and with NEN G3 (n = 7) at 18 months (IQR = 40). After RLT, disease stabilization or regression was observed in 42 (87.5% of) patients. RLT did not cause statistical changes in creatinine or GFR values. Hematological parameters (RBC, WBC, PLT, HGB) as well as chromogranin A concentration decreased significantly. There were no statistical differences between both subgroups regarding the type of radioisotope (177-Lutetium vs. 177-Lutetium and 90-Yttrium). After RLT in long-term observation, the median observation time (OT) was 14 months (IQR = 18 months). In patients with progression (n = 8), the median PFS was 20 months (IQR = 16 months), while in patients with confirmed death (n = 9), the median overall survival (OS) was 8 months (IQR = 14 months).Conclusions: Our study showed that 87.5% of NEN patients with unknown origin, non-GEP-NENs, and those with GEP-NEN G3 grade had benefited from the radioligand therapy. There were no significantly negative impacts on renal parameters. The decrease of bone marrow parameters was acceptable in relation to beneficial disease course. The decrease of chromogranin concentration was confirmed as a predictive factor for disease stabilization or regression.

Methods: Sixteen patients (aged 53-78 y; mean age, 64.7 +/- 6.5 y) with a single functioning kidney received PRLT with Lu-177-PSMA-617 between March 2015 and October 2018. All parameters of renal function (serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and electrolytes) were prospectively documented in a structured database and analyzed before each PRLT cycle and in follow-up. Renal function was further quantified by measuring tubular extraction rate (TER) using Tc-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine renal scintigraphy. Treatment-related adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to obtain the progression-free survival and overall survival. Results: The median administered activity was 22.1 GBq (range, 15.4-33.8 GBq). The calculated absorbed radiation dose to the kidney per cycle was 5.3 +/- 2.1 Gy (0.81 +/- 0.32 Gy/GBq). Renal function was already impaired at baseline in 43.7% of patients, including CTCAE grade 1 renal impairment in 25.0% and CTCAE grade 2 in 18.8%. Grade 1 and 2 renal impairment, respectively, were present in 37.5% and 6.3% of the patients after the first PRLT cycle and in 31.3% and 12.5% after the second cycle. No CTCAE grade 3 or 4 nephrotoxicity was observed during or after treatment. There was no significant change in either TER or the ratio of TER to lower-limit TER after the last cycle of treatment (P > 0.05). The median PFS was 8.1 mo based on both the criteria of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer and RECIST. The median overall survival has yet to be reached with a median follow-up time of 19.3 mo (range, 5.8-45.3 mo). Conclusion: In patients with a single functioning kidney, Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT is feasible, seems to be effective, and is well tolerated, without any signs of acute or subacute nephrotoxicity during a mean follow-up of nearly 2 y (and up to 45.3 mo). Further long-term follow-up of this special patient group is warranted.

Activated microglia are the main cell type expressing the TSPO at sites of central nervous system pathology. Radioligands for the TSPO can therefore measure active disease in the brain. This article details the synthesis, radiofluorination, and pharmacologic evaluation of a new TSPO-specific pyrazolopyrimidine, DPA-714. Methods: The affinity of DPA-714 for the TSPO was measured in rat kidney membranes with H-3-PK11195. The in vitro functional activity of DPA-714 was measured in a steroidogenic assay in which the ability of DPA-714 to increase pregnenolone synthesis was measured with rat C6 glioma cells. The radiofluorination of DPA-714 was achieved by nucleophilic F-18-fluoride displacement of the tosylate precursor. F-18-DPA-714 was assessed in rats harboring unilateral quinolinic acid (QA) lesions. In addition, pretreatment experiments were performed with PK11195 (5 mg/kg), DPA-714 (1 mg/kg), and DPA-713 (1 mg/kg). The in vivo binding and biodistribution of F-18-DPA-714 were determined in a baboon with PET. Experiments involving presaturation with PK11195 (1.5 mg/kg) and displacement with DPA-714 (1 mg/kg) were conducted to evaluate the specificity of radioligand binding. Results: In vitro binding studies revealed that DPA-714 displayed a high affinity for the TSPO (dissociation constant, 7.0 nM). DPA-714 stimulated pregnenolone synthesis at levels 80% above the baseline. F-18-DPA-714 was prepared at a 16% radiochemical yield and a specific activity of 270 GBq/mu mol. In rats harboring unilateral QA lesions, an 8-fold-higher level of uptake of F-18-DPA-714 was observed in the ipsilateral striatum than in the contralateral striatum. Uptake in the ipsilateral striatum was shown to be selective because it was inhibited to the level in the contralateral striatum in the presence of PK11195, nonlabeled DPA-714, or DPA-713. PET studies demonstrated rapid penetration and good retention of F-18-DPA-714 in the baboon brain. Pretreatment with PK11195 effectively inhibited the uptake of F-18-DPA-714 in the whole brain, indicating its selective binding to the TSPO. The injection of nonlabeled DPA-714 20 min after the injection of F-18-DPA-714 resulted in radioligand washout, demonstrating the reversibility of F-18-DPA-714 binding. Conclusion: F-18-DPA-714 is a specific radioligand for the TSPO, displaying promising in vivo properties and thus warranting further investigation.

We studied whether NaF shows any uptake in the brain tissue of patients with acute ischemic stroke. This is a post-hoc analysis of previously reported cerebral atherosclerosis research with positron emission tomography which applied the two radioligands, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and NaF for the detection of culprit atheroma among 20 acute cerebral infarction patients (mean age = 75.1 +/- 9.0 years; 10 women). In this study, we measured the maximum and mean standardized uptake value (SUVmax and SUVmean) of NaF uptake level in the cerebral infarct region between lesions with and without diffusion weighted image (DWI) positivity, indicating acute ischemic cell death. Correlation analysis was performed between NaF uptake levels and imaging and clinical variables, including neurological severity. The NaF uptake levels were significantly higher in DWI positive lesions than in negative lesions (SUVmax: 2.0 [0.60-4.2] versus 0.20 [0.10-0.40], p = 0.021 by Mann-Whitney U test). The intensity of NaF uptake (SUVmax) was significantly correlated with the initial neurological severity (Spearman's rho = 0.579, p = 0.007) and white blood cell count (Spearman's rho = 0.626, p p 0.003). During ischemic stroke NaF was concentrated in brain tissue undergoing acute cell death and its uptake intensity was correlated with neurological severity, suggesting that NaF could reflect acute ischemic cell death after stroke.

The existing pharmacological studies suggest the usefulness of histamine H-4 receptor ligands in the treatment of many inflammatory and immunomodulatory diseases, including allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, colitis or pruritus. Up to date, several potent histamine H-4 receptor ligands were developed, none of which was registered as a drug yet. In this study, a series of potent indole-like and triazine derivatives were tested, in radioligand displacement and functional assays at histamine H-4 receptor, as well as in human eosinophils adhesion assay to endothelium. For selected compounds permeability, cytotoxicity, metabolic and in vivo studies were conducted. Adhesion assay differentiated the activity of different groups of compounds with a known affinity towards the histamine H-4 receptor. Most of the tested compounds downregulated the number of adherent cells. However, adhesion assay revealed additional properties of tested compounds that had not been detected in radioligand displacement and aequorin-based functional assays. Furthermore, for some tested compounds, these abnormal effects were confirmed during the in vivo studies. In conclusion, eosinophils adhesion assay uncovered pharmacological activity of histamine H-4 receptor ligands that has been later confirmed in vivo, underscoring the value of well-suited cell-based phenotypic screening approach in drug discovery.

In an attempt to create a versatile peptidic research tool for the direct study of the CB1 receptor-peptide ligand interactions, Hp (1-7) was radiolabeled and in vitro characterized in rat and CB1 knockout mouse brain membrane homogenates. In saturation and competition radioligand binding studies, [H-3]Hp (1-7) labeled membrane receptors with high densities and displayed specific binding to a receptor protein, but seemingly not to the cannabinoid type 1, in comparison the results with the prototypic JWH-018, AM251, rimonabant, Hp(1-9) and RVD-Hp(1-9) (pepcan 12) ligands in both rat brain and CB1 knockout mouse brain homogenates. Furthermore, functional [S-35]GTP gamma S binding studies revealed that Hp(1-7) and Hp (1-9) only weakly activated G-proteins in both brain membrane homogenates. Based on our findings and the latest literature data, we assume that the Hp(1-7) peptide fragment may be an allosteric ligand or indirect regulator of the endocannabinoid system rather than an endogenous ligand of the CB1 receptor.

Blood sampling and separating plasma for RMA has been a challenge especially with small animal PET research. This work aimed to overcome this problem by presenting a semi-automated lead shielded microextraction by packed sorbents (SLS-MEPS). The capability of SLS-MEPS was evaluated for RMA of [C-11]SMW139 as a PET radioligand in rat plasma samples. [C-11]SMW139 is a potential radioligand with high receptor binding for P2X(7)R in vivo. The validation method was individually performed for [C-11]SMW139 and [C-12]SMW139 with reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) utilizing radio- and UV-detector, respectively. The limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) [C-11]SMW139 in rat plasma were 3 and 10 Becquerel (Bq), respectively. The standard calibration curve was obtained for [C-11]SMW139 within the concentration range 10-15000 Bq with over 0.995 coefficients for all assays. In addition, the capability of SLS-MEPS in combination with HPLC-UV for extraction of [C-12]SMW139 in rat plasma was also challenged and the obtained results showed a proper linearity (20-2000 mu g mL(-1)), accuracy and repeatability.

J	Wood, MD; Gillard, M				Wood, Martyn D.; Gillard, Michel			Evidence for a differential interaction of brivaracetam and levetiracetam with the synaptic vesicle 2A protein	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Antiepileptic drug; Epilepsy; Modulator; Synaptic vesicle protein	ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUG LEVETIRACETAM; BINDING-SITE; SV2A LIGAND; HUMAN BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; TRANSPORTER; INHIBITOR; MECHANISM; DISCOVERY	Objective: Brivaracetam (BRV) and levetiracetam (LEV) are effective antiepileptic drugs that bind selectively to the synaptic vesicle 2A (SV2A) protein. However, BRV differs from LEV in that it exhibits more potent and complete seizure suppression in animal models including in amygdala-kindled mice, where BRV afforded nearly complete seizure suppression. This raises the possibility that aside from potency differences, BRV and LEV may interact differently with the SV2A protein, which is not apparent in radioligand-binding competition studies. In this study, we used a recently identified SV2A allosteric modulator, UCB1244283, that appears to induce conformational changes in SV2A, to probe the binding properties of labeled BRV and LEV. Methods: Radioligand binding studies were carried out using [H-3]BRV and [H-3]LEV. Studies were performed in membranes from both recombinant cells expressing human SV2A protein and human brain tissue. Results: The modulator increased the binding of both radioligands but by different mechanisms. For [H-3] BRV, the increase was driven mainly by an increase in affinity, whereas for [H-3] LEV, the increase was due to an increase in the number of apparent binding sites. Kinetic studies confirmed this differential effect. Significance: These studies suggest that LEV and BRV may act at different binding sites or interact with different conformational states of the SV2A protein. It is possible that some of the pharmacologic differences between BRV and LEV could be due to different interactions with the SV2A protein.

Here, we report in vivo validation of [C-11] TZ3321, a potent S1PR1 radioligand, for imaging vascular inflammation in a rat model of carotid injury. The right common carotid artery of male adult Sprague-Dawley rats was injured by balloon overinflation that denuded the endothelium and distended the vessel wall. Animals received a 60-minute micro-positron emission tomography (micro PET) scan with [C-11] TZ3321 at 72 hours after injury. Ex vivo autoradiography was also conducted. The expression and cellular location of S1PR1 were examined by immunohistological analysis. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the first 100-second microPET/computed tomography (CT) image indicated the location of bilateral common carotid arteries. [C-11] TZ3321 displayed significantly higher accumulation (standardized uptake values: 0.93 +/- 0.07 vs 0.78 +/- 0.09, n = 6, P = .001) in the injured carotid artery than in the contralateral side. Increased tracer uptake in the injured artery was confirmed by autoradiography (photostimulated luminescence measures: 85.5 +/- 0.93 vs 71.48 +/- 6.22, n = 2). Concordantly, high S1PR1expression was observed in infiltrated inflammatory cells in the injured artery. Our studies demonstrate [C-11] TZ3321 microPET is able to detect the acute upregulation of S1PR1 expression in inflamed carotid artery. Therefore, [C-11] TZ3321 has potential to be a PET radiotracer for detecting early inflammatory response and monitoring therapeutic efficacy of vascular inflammation.

Specific binding of [H-3]imidafenacin in human tissues was saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. The K-d value for specific [H-3]imidafenacin binding in the human bladder was approximately 3 times higher than that in the parotid gland. Unlabeled imidafenacin as well as the clinically used antimuscarinic agents, oxybutynin, tolterodine, and solifenacin, competed with [H-3]imidafenacin for binding sites in the human bladder and parotid gland in a concentration-dependent manner, which indicated pharmacological specificity of [H-3]imidafenacin binding sites. The K-i for imidafenacin in the human bladder approximately corresponded to pharmacological potency for the competitive blockade of carbachol-induced contractions of bladder, indicating a close correlation between binding affinity of imidafenacin to bladder muscarinic receptors and its pharmacological effects in the bladder. In conclusion, the current study is the first to provide direct evidence to demonstrate that imidafenacin bound muscarinic receptors in the human bladder, supporting its clinical relevance as a therapeutic agent for overactive bladder. [H-3]Imidafenacin may also be a useful radioligand for labeling the M-3 subtype of muscarinic receptors with higher selectivity than other radioligands.

None of the neurosteroids displaced the radioligand from its binding site on the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. However, their continual presence at nanomolar concentrations had significant effects on ligand binding kinetics, interacting through distinct sites in saturation, competition and dissociation experiments. 3 PS at 30 nM enhanced the specific binding to about 150% of that in its absence and enhanced the dissociation rate three-fold indicating a positive modulation of [3H] ifenprodil binding to the NMDA receptor. Furthermore, PS increased B-max and decreased K-d suggesting that the neurosteroid exposes new [3H] ifenprodil binding sites with altered properties. 4 In contrast, 3a5bS(30 nM) decreased specific [3H] ifenprodil binding to approximately 40% of that determined for the radioligand alone. The presence of 3 alpha 5 beta S at nanomolar concentrations induced biphasic curve fits in saturation, competition as well as dissociation experiments. 5 In conclusion, the present study show that the allosteric modulators PS or 3 alpha 5 beta S change [3H] ifenprodil binding kinetics in a way indicating conformational alteration of its binding site on the NR2B subunit.

We have stably co-expressed these two subunits in a CHO cell line, characterised its pharmacology and compared it to the native receptor in rat brain membranes. Radioligand binding using [H-3]CGP54626A demonstrated a similar rank order of potency between recombinant and native receptors: CGP62349 > CGP54626A > SCH 50911 > 3-aminopropylphosphinicacid (3-APPA) > GABA > baclofen > saclofen > phaclofen. However, differences were observed in the affinity of agonists, which were higher at the native receptor, suggesting that in the recombinant system a large number of the receptors were in the low agonist affinity state. In contrast, [S-35]GTPgammaS binding studies did not show any differences between recombinant and native receptors with the full agonists GABA and 3-APPA. Measurement of cAMP accumulation in the cells revealed a degree of endogenous coupling of the receptors to G-proteins. This is most likely to be due to the high expression levels of receptors (B-max = 22.5 +/- 2.5 pmol/mg protein) in this experimental system. There was no evidence of GABA(B2) receptors, when expressed alone, binding [H-3]CGP54626A, [H-3]GABA, [H-3]3-APPA nor of GABA having any effect on basal [S-35]GTPgammaS binding or cAMP levels.

The HEKsst(2) and PC3 cells were incubated with variable concentrations of 5-aza-dC and VPA to investigate the uptake of Lu-177-DOTATATE. Cell survival, subsequent to external X-rays (0.6 or 1.2 Gy) and a 24 h incubation with 57.5 or 136 kBq/mL Lu-177-DOTATATE, was investigated via colony formation assay to examine the effect of the epidrugs. In the case of stimulated HEKsst(2) cells, the uptake of Lu-177-DOTATATE increased by a factor of 28 in comparison to the unstimulated cells. Further, stimulated HEKsst(2) cells demonstrated lower survival fractions (factor 4). The survival fractions of the PC3 cells remained almost unchanged. VPA and 5-aza-dC did not induce changes to the intrinsic radiosensitivity of the cells after X-ray irradiation. Clear stimulatory effects on HEKsst(2) cells were demonstrated by increased cell uptake of the radioligand and enhanced SST2 receptor quantity. In conclusion, the investigated approach is suitable to stimulate the somatostatin receptor expression and thus the uptake of Lu-177-DOTATATE, enabling a more efficient treatment for patients with poor response to peptide radionuclide therapy (PRRT).

The purpose of the present research was to determine the convergence of the results of the 3 methods in terms of 3 parameters-occupancy (s), distribution volume of the nondisplaceable reference binding compartment (V-ND), and nondisplaceable reference binding potential (BPND) of the radioligand-in the absence of a gold standard. We tested 104 cases culled from the literature and calculated the goodness of fit of the least-squares and Deming II methods of linear regression when applied to the determination of s, V-ND, and BPND using the goodness-of-fit parameters R-2, coefficient of variation (root-mean square error [RMSE]), and the infinity norm (parallel to X parallel to(infinity)) with both regression methods. We observed superior convergence among the values of s, V-ND, and BPND for the inhibition and occupancy plots. The inhibition plot emerged as the plot with a slightly higher degree of convergence (based on R-2, RMSE, and parallel to X parallel to(infinity) value). With two regression methods (the least-squares method [LSM] and the Deming II [DM] method), the estimated values of s, V-ND, and BPND generally converged. The inhibition and occupancy plots yielded the best fits to the data, according to the goodness-of-fit parameters, due primarily to absence of commingling of the dependent and independent variables tested with the saturation (original Lassen) plot.

Our study aimed to evaluate whether high-resolution diffusion tensor-imaging (DTI) can detect anatomical biomarkers in early-stage PD, and has the potential to visualize asymmetry effects comparable to the 123I-FP-CIT SPECT (DaTSCAN). Methods: Ten early-stage PD patients with mild disease severity and ten age- and gender-matched healthy controls were examined with a high-resolution DTI protocol at a 3 Tesla MRI scanner to assess fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the ventral, middle and dorsal region of SN. In addition, a subgroup of 5 PD patients underwent a DaTSCAN. Results: PD subjects showed reduced FA values in all SN regions compared to controls, but post hoc analysis revealed a significant reduction (p = .032) in the dorsal region. There was no significant correlation between clinical data and FA values. Subgroup analysis of PD patients with asymmetric radioligand uptake in the DaTSCAN demonstrated also significant asymmetric FA values (p = .027) in the dorsal region of SN. Conclusions: Our results provide preliminary evidence that high-resolution DTI can detect in early-stage PD patients with mild disease severity an anatomical biomarker in the dorsal region of SN, indicating microstructural disorganization. This biomarker, discriminating potentially in vivo between patients and healthy people, could be valuable for early PD diagnosis. If asymmetric radioligand uptake in the DaTSCAN was present, also asymmetry effects in the dorsal region of SN were obtained by DTI. These findings might contribute to improve effectiveness in diagnosing and monitoring PD. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Visualizing Nerve Injury in a Neuropathic Pain Model with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FTC-146 PET/MRI	THERANOSTICS			English	Article							INDUCED SPINAL SENSITIZATION; CARPAL-TUNNEL-SYNDROME; SIGMA-1 RECEPTOR; SCHWANN-CELLS; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; MICE; NEURONS; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION	The ability to locate nerve injury and ensuing neuroinflammation would have tremendous clinical value for improving both the diagnosis and subsequent management of patients suffering from pain, weakness, and other neurologic phenomena associated with peripheral nerve injury. Although several non-invasive techniques exist for assessing the clinical manifestations and morphological aspects of nerve injury, they often fail to provide accurate diagnoses due to limited specificity and/or sensitivity. Herein, we describe a new imaging strategy for visualizing a molecular biomarker of nerve injury/neuroinflammation, i.e., the sigma-1 receptor (S1R), in a rat model of nerve injury and neuropathic pain. The two-fold higher increase of S1Rs was shown in the injured compared to the uninjured nerve by Western blotting analyses. With our novel S1R-selective radioligand, [F-18]FTC-146 (6-(3-[F-18]fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(azepan-1-yl)ethyl)benzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-one), and positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), we could accurately locate the site of nerve injury created in the rat model. We verified the accuracy of this technique by ex vivo autoradiography and immunostaining, which demonstrated a strong correlation between accumulation of [F-18]FTC-146 and S1R staining. Finally, pain relief could also be achieved by blocking S1Rs in the neuroma with local administration of non-radioactive [19F]FTC-146. In summary, [F-18]FTC-146 S1R PET/MR imaging has the potential to impact how we diagnose, manage and treat patients with nerve injury, and thus warrants further investigation.

Methods: Ten individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 10 matched healthy controls underwent brain imaging using integrated MR/PET and the radioligand [C-11]-PBR28. Diagnosis history and clinical assessments including Upper Motor Neuron Burden Scale (UMNB) were obtained from patients with ALS. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) analyses including tract-based spatial statistics and tractography were applied. DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusivities (mean, axial, and radial) were measured in regions of interest. Cortical thickness was assessed using surface-based analysis. The locations of structural changes, measured by DTI and the areas of cortical thinning, were compared to regional glial activation measured by relative [C-11]-PBR28 uptake. Results: In this cohort of individuals with ALS, reduced FA and cortical thinning colocalized with regions demonstrating higher radioligand binding. [C-11]-PBR28 binding in the left motor cortex was correlated with FA (r=-0.68, p < 0.05) and cortical thickness (r=-0.75, p < 0.05). UMNB was correlated with glial activation (r=+0.75, p < 0.05), FA (r=-20.77, p, 0.05), and cortical thickness (r = -0.75, p < 0.05) in the motor cortex. Conclusions: Increased uptake of the glial marker [C-11]-PBR28 colocalizes with changes in FA and cortical thinning. This suggests a link between disease mechanisms (gliosis and inflammation) and structural changes (cortical thinning and white and gray matter changes). In this multimodal neuroimaging work, we provide an in vivo model to investigate the pathogenesis of ALS.

One very promising PET tracer is (S)-1-(4-(2-[F-18]-fluoroethoxy)benzyl)-5-[1-(2-methoxymethylpyrrolidinyl)sulfonyl]isatin (isatin), a caspase-3 inhibitor, which has been developed at the University Hospital of Munster to image cell death (apoptosis). The translation of this novel tracer from preclinical evaluation to clinical examinations requires biodistribution studies, which characterize the pharmakodynamics and metabolic fate of the compound. This information is used to further optimize the radioligands and to interpret radioactive signals from tissues upon injection of the radioligand in vivo with respect to their specificity. The analysis of the metabolism of radioligands is hampered by the low amount of the compound being typically injected (nano/picomolar amount per injection). In the present study, electrochemistry (EC) is applied to elucidate the oxidative metabolism pathway of the radiotracer. Previous studies have demonstrated that EC can be utilized as a complementary tool to conventional in vitro approaches in drug metabolism studies. Thereby, potential oxidative metabolites of the isatin are determined by EC coupled to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EC/ESI-MS). Moreover, using EC/liquid chromatography (LC) and ESI-ion trap MSn, structural elucidation of the oxidation products is performed. Comparatively to EC, in vitro metabolism studies with rat liver microsomes are conducted. Finally, the developed LC/ESI-MS method is applied to determine metabolites in body fluids and cell extracts from in vivo studies with the nonradioactive (F-19) and radioactive isatin (F-18). On the basis of the electrochemically generated oxidation products of the radioligand, the major radioactive metabolite occurring in vivo was successfully identified.

[2005] Bioorg Med Chem 13:77-87). In this study, WC-10 was radiolabeled with tritium (specific activity = 80 Ci/mmol) and [H-3]WC-10 binding to genetically cloned dopamine D-2L and D-3 receptors was evaluated in vitro. [H-3]WC-10 binds with a 66-fold higher affinity to human HEK D-3 than HEK D-2L, receptors, with a dissociation constant (K-d) of 1.2 nM at HEK D-3 receptors. However, [H-3]WC-10 binds to rat Sf9 rD(3) receptors with a K-d of 3.9 nM, a value that is 3-fold lower than binding to human HEK D-3 receptors and 40-fold value higher than binding to rat Sf9 rD(2L). receptors. The K-d values obtained from saturation binding experiments were consistent with the results determined from kinetic (k(on) and k(off)) studies. The pharmacologic profiles of a series of dopaminergic drugs for inhibiting the binding of [H-3]WC-10 to D-3 receptors was in agreement with previously reported data.

SRA880 has high affinity for native rat, mouse, monkey and human cerebral cortex somatostatin sst(1) receptors (pK(d) = 7.8 - 8.6) and for human recombinant sst(1) receptors (pK(d) = 8.0 - 8.1). SRA880 displayed significantly lower affinity for the other human recombinant somatostatin receptors (pK(d) less than or equal to 6.0) or a wide range of neurotransmitter receptors, except for the human dopamine D4 receptors. SRA880 was characterized in various transduction assays: somatotropin release inhibiting factor (SRIF) induced inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation, SRIF stimulated-GTPgammaS binding, and SRIF stimulated luciferase gene expression; in all tests, SRA880 was devoid of intrinsic activity and acted as an apparently surmountable antagonist with pK(B) values of 7.5-7.7. Combined with the data from binding studies, these results suggest that SRA880 acts as a competitive antagonist. Thus, SRA880 is the first non-peptide somatostatin sst(1) receptor antagonist to be reported; SRA880 will be a useful tool for the characterization of somatostatin sst(1) receptor-mediated effects both in vitro and in vivo.

Caloric Restriction-Induced Decreases in Dopamine Receptor Availability are Associated with Leptin Concentration	OBESITY			English	Article							GASTRIC BYPASS-SURGERY; WEIGHT-LOSS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; INSULIN SENSITIVITY; FOOD RESTRICTION; HUMAN OBESITY; RATS; AMPHETAMINE; STRIATUM; RELEASE	ObjectiveIt has been previously reported that early after Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass, dopamine (DA) type 2 and 3 receptor (D2/3R) binding potential (BPND) was decreased from preoperative levels. The current study aimed to determine whether calorie restriction without weight loss modifies D2/3R BPND and whether such changes are explained by neuroendocrine regulation. MethodsFifteen females with obesity (BMI=396 kg/m(2)) were studied before and after approximate to 10 days of a very-low-calorie-diet (VLCD). Outcome measures included fasting insulin, leptin, acyl ghrelin, and glucose, and insulin sensitivity and disposition index were estimated using the oral-minimal model (OMM) method. Participants underwent positron emission tomography scanning with the displaceable radioligand [F-18]fallypride to estimate available regional D2/3R levels. Regions of interest included the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, hypothalamus, and substantia nigra (SN). ResultsWith the VLCD, weight decreased slightly (-3 kg). Insulin, glucose, and leptin decreased significantly, but there was no change in acyl ghrelin or measures from OMM. SN D2/3R BPND decreased significantly, with trends toward decreased levels in the remaining regions. The decrease in leptin concentration strongly predicted the change in D2/3R BPND in all regions (all P0.004). ConclusionsIn obesity, reductions in regional D2/3R availability after VLCD are suggestive of increased endogenous DA competing with the radioligand. Changes in regional D2/3R availability were associated with decreases in leptin concentrations that occurred before clinically significant weight loss.

In this study, a fusion protein, cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD)-HSA-TIMP2, formed by conjugating HSA-TIMP2 with a RGD peptide, and its I-123- and Ga-68-labeled compounds, were synthesized and evaluated with in vivo tumor imaging using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). RGD-HSA-TIMP2 was synthesized by covalent bonding of the RGD peptide to the side chain amino groups of HSA-TIMP2 from a two-step reaction involving from activation with N-succinimidyl iodoacetate. This conjugation improved the anticancer effect of HSA-TIMP2 in cancer cells. The I-123- and Ga-68-labeled fusion proteins were prepared and subsequently injected into the tail veins of mice bearing human glioblastoma cancer U87MG xenografts for SPECT and PET imaging and biodistribution studies. Tumor uptake of radioligand was high in both the PET images and in the biodistribution studies at 3 h after injection. These studies demonstrated that the new fusion protein has potential not only as an anticancer agent but also as a radioligand for the diagnosis of tumors.

The aim of the present study was to describe the in vitro and in vivo profile of RBx 343E48F0 and to compare the results with the present day benchmark therapy, tiotropium. Radioligand binding and isolated tissue based functional assays were used to evaluate the affinity, potency and receptor subtype selectivity of RBx 343E48F0. Inhibition of carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction in the anaesthetized rat and acetylcholine-induced bronchoconstriction in the conscious rat were used to assess the extent and duration of the bronchospasmolytic activity of RBx 343E48F0. In vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic studies were conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and lung retention properties of the compound. In vitro radioligand binding studies using human recombinant muscarinic receptors showed that RBx 343E48F0 had a pKi of 9.6 at the M(3) receptor and a 60-fold selectivity for the M(3) receptor over the M(2) receptor. In isolated tissue bioassays, it exhibited surmountable antagonism at the guinea pig trachea with a pK(B) of 9.5. Intratracheal administration to anaesthetized rats demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of carbachol-induced bronchoconstriction with an ED(50) value of 110 ng/kg. RBx 343E48F0 also exhibited a fast onset of action and long duration of action of greater 24 h. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods The in vitro binding affinities for alpha 1-adrenergic, muscarinic, and purinergic receptors in the rat prostate and bladder were measured by radioligand binding assays. Rats received vehicle or SPE (0.6 to 60 mg/kg/day) orally for 4 weeks, and alpha 1-adrenergic and muscarinic receptor binding in tissues of these rats were measured. Results Saw palmetto extract inhibited specific binding of [H-3]prazosin and [N-methy-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride (NMS) but not alpha, beta-methylene adenosine triphosphate [2,8-H-3]tetrasodium salt in the rat prostate and bladder. The binding activity of SPE for muscarinic receptors was four times greater than that for alpha 1-adrenergic receptors. Scatchard analysis revealed that SPE significantly reduced the maximal number of binding sites (B-max) for each radioligand in the prostate and bladder under in vitro condition. Repeated oral administration of SPE to rats brought about significant alteration in B-max for prostatic [H-3]prazosin binding and for bladder [H-3]NMS binding. Such alteration by SPE was selective to the receptors in the lower urinary tract. Conclusions Saw palmetto extract exerts significant binding activity on autonomic receptors in the lower urinary tract under in vitro and in vivo conditions.

Parasympathetic and sympathetic neurons terminate in the pancreas and provide tight control of endocrine and exocrine functions. The aim of this study was to determine whether the pancreas can be imaged with a radioligand that binds to specific neuroreceptors. Using fluorine-18 4-fluorobenzyltrozamicol (FBT), which binds to the presynaptic vesicular acetylcholine transporter, positron emission tomography scans were performed in four adult mice, two adult rhesus monkeys, and one adult human. In these mammals, the pancreas is intensely FBT avid, with uptake greater than in any other organ at 30, 60, and 90 min. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) ratios of pancreas to liver, for example, ranged from 1.4 to 1.7 in rhesus monkeys (mean 1.6; median 1.7) and from 1.9 to 4.7 (mean 3.24; median 3.02) in mice. The maximum SUV ratio of pancreas to liver in the human was 1.8. These data suggest that neuroreceptor imaging of the pancreas in vivo is feasible in animal models and humans. This imaging could allow researchers to interrogate functions under control of the autonomic nervous system in the pancreas, with applications possible in transplanted and native pancreata. Also, as beta cell function is intimately related to parasympathetic cholinergic input, FBT activity in the pancreas may correlate with insulin-producing beta cell mass. This could ultimately provide a method of in vivo imaging in animal models and humans for diabetes research.

The average radiochemical yield of [C-11]atipamezole was 24% based on [C-11]formaldehyde, and the synthesis time, including HPLC purification and formulation, was 45 min.

Initial halogenation occurs at C-3, followed (in the cases of chlorine and bromine) by the less reactive C-8, to afford 3-haloboldines- and 3,8-dihaloboldines (2-5). Using a 2:1 ratio of N-iodosuccinimide to boldine, however, only the 3-iodo derivative 6 was obtained.

Phenibut, Semax, and GIZh-290 Modulate Cortical mGluII Receptors in an Attention Deficit Model in Mice	NEUROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						attention deficit syndrome; modeling; "closed enriched cross maze" test; nootropic drugs; atomoxetine; radioligand analysis; metabotropic glutamate receptors		In our previous experiments, it was found that the nootropic drugs piracetam (200 mg/kg/day, intraperitoneally), pantogam (100), pantogam active (200), phenibut (70), and semax (0.6), as well as a new derivative of racetam GIZh-290 (3), and the comparison drug atomoxetine (3.0), under subchronic administration restore attention stability to new objects in the "closed enriched cross maze" test, showing selectivity of the effect in relation to a subpopulation of CD-1 mice with an initially low attention index (ED-Low). In this study, the effect of nootropics on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRII) in the prefrontal cortex of these mice was studied using the receptor binding of a specific radioligand [G-H-3]LY354740. It was found that the density (B-max) of mGluII receptors in the brains of subpopulation with the ED-Low phenotype was 11-25% lower than in subpopulation with the ED-High phenotype. None of the drugs had an effect on these receptors in the subpopulation with the ED-High phenotype, whereas phenibut, semax, and GIZh-290 showed efficacy in the ED-Low phenotype, increasing B-max values by 60, 19, and 22%, respectively. Thus, it was shown for the first time that mGluRII are involved in the pathogenesis of attention impairment, and the ability of phenibut, semax, and GIZh-290 (2,6-dimethylanilide (2-oxo-4-phenylpyrrolidine-1-yl) acetate to selectively normalize the reduced density of these receptors indicates the prospects of their use as drugs for the treatment of attention deficit disorder.

GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor target of tetramethylenedisulfotetramine	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						neurotoxicity; convulsant; molecular modeling	GATED CHLORIDE CHANNEL; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; BINDING-SITE; AMINO-ACID; BRAIN; TETRAMINE; TOXICITY; TETRAMETHYLENEDISULPHOTETRAMINE; RECOGNITION; SEIZURES	Use of the highly toxic and easily prepared rodenticide tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) was banned after thousands of accidental or intentional human poisonings, but it is of continued concern as a chemical threat agent. TETS is a noncompetitive blocker of the GABA type A receptor (GABA(A)R), but its molecular interaction has not been directly established for lack of a suitable radioligand to localize the binding site. We synthesized [C-14]TETS (14 mCi/mmol, radiochemical purity >99%) by reacting sulfamide with (HCHO)-C-14 and s-trioxane then completion of the sequential cyclization with excess HCHO. The outstanding radiocarbon sensitivity of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) allowed the use of [C-14] TETS in neuroreceptor binding studies with rat brain membranes in comparison with the standard GABA(A)R radioligand 4'-ethynyl-4-n-[H-3] propylbicycloorthobenzoate ([H-3] EBOB) (46 Ci/mmol), illustrating the use of AMS for characterizing the binding sites of high-affinity C-14 radio-ligands. Fourteen noncompetitive antagonists of widely diverse chemotypes assayed at 1 or 10 mu M inhibited [C-14] TETS and [H-3] EBOB binding to a similar extent (r(2) = 0.71). Molecular dynamics simulations of these 14 toxicants in the pore region of the alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 GABA(A)R predict unique and significant polar interactions for TETS with alpha(1)T1' and gamma(2)S2', which are not observed for EBOB or the GABAergic insecticides. Several GABA(A)R modulators similarly inhibited [C-14] TETS and [H-3] EBOB binding, including midazolam, flurazepam, avermectin Ba1, baclofen, isoguvacine, and propofol, at 1 or 10 mu M, providing an in vitro system for recognizing candidate antidotes.

Kinetic modeling of the monoamine oxidase B radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]SL25.1188 in human brain with high-resolution positron emission tomography	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						[C-11]SL25.1188; human; MAO-B; modeling; PET; reversible radioligand	QUANTITATIVE ENZYME AUTORADIOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; MAO-B; PET; BINDING; DISEASE; RADIOSYNTHESIS; INHIBITION; EXTRACTION; FRACTION	This article describes the kinetic modeling of [C-11]SL25.1188 ([(S)-5-methoxymethyl-3-[6-(4,4,4-trifluorobutoxy)-benzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl]-oxazolidin-2-[C-11]one]) binding to monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) in the human brain using high-resolution positron emission tomography (PET). Seven healthy subjects underwent two separate 90- minute PET scans after an intravenous injection of [C-11]SL25.1188. Complementary arterial blood sampling was acquired. Radioactivity was quickly eliminated from plasma with 80% of parent compound remaining at 90 minutes. Metabolites were more polar than the parent compound. Time-activity curves showed high brain uptake, early peak and washout rate consistent with known regional MAO-B concentration. A two-tissue compartment model (2-TCM) provided better fits to the data than a 1-TCM. Measurement of total distribution volume (V-T) showed very good identifiability (based on coefficient of variation (COV)) for all regions of interest (ROls) (COV(V-T) < 8%), low between-subject variability (similar to 20%), and quick temporal convergence (within 5% of final value at 45 minutes). Logan graphical method produces very good estimation of VT. Regional VT highly correlated with previous postmortem report of MAO-B level (r(2)= >= 0.9). Specific binding would account from 70% to 90% of V-T. Hence, V-T measurement of [C-11]SL25.1(1)88 PET is an excellent estimation of MAO-B concentration.

Positron emission tomography imaging using an inverse agonist radioligand to assess cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in rodents	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							P-GLYCOPROTEIN; SR 141716A; PHARMACOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; BRAIN; BINDING; ANANDAMIDE; ANTAGONISM; MICE; TRANSPORTER	[(11)C] MePPEP is an inverse agonist and a radioligand developed to image cannabinoid CB(1) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). It provides reversible, high specific signal in monkey brain. We assessed [(11)C] MePPEP in rodent brain with regard to receptor selectivity, susceptibility to transport by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), sensitivity to displacement by agonists, and accumulation of radiometabolites. We used CB(1) receptor knockout mice and P-gp knockout mice to assess receptor selectivity and sensitivity to efflux transport, respectively. Using serial measurements of PET brain activity and plasma concentrations of [(11)C] MePPEP, we estimated CB(1) receptor density in rat brain as distribution volume. CB(1) knockout mice showed only nonspecific brain uptake, and [(11)C] MePPEP was not a substrate for P-gp. Direct acting agonists anandamide (10 mg/ kg), methanandamide (10 mg/ kg), CP 55,940 (1 mg/ kg), and indirect agonist URB597 (0.3 and 0.6 mg/ kg) failed to displace [(11)C] MePPEP, while the inverse agonist rimonabant (3 and 10 mg/ kg) displaced >65% of [(11)C] MePPEP. Radiometabolites represented similar to 13% of total radioactivity in brain between 30 and 120 min. [(11)C] MePPEP was selective for the CB(1) receptor, was not a substrate for P-gp, and was more potently displaced by inverse agonists than agonists. The low potency of agonists suggests either a large receptor reserve or non-overlapping binding sites for agonists and inverse agonists. Radiometabolites of [(11)C] MePPEP in brain caused distribution volume to be overestimated by similar to 13%. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 81 consecutive patients with neocortical epilepsy who underwent epilepsy surgery and achieved a favourable surgical outcome, including 36 patients with normal MRI. Side-by-side visual analysis and subtraction images were classified as correctly localizing,correctly lateralizing, or non-localizing/non-lateralizing images according to the resected lobe. Results: Side-by-side visual analysis and subtraction SPECT correctly localized the epileptogenic lobe in 58.9% and 63.0% of patients, respectively. The two methods were complementary and the diagnostic sensitivity of ictal SPECT using the two methods was 79.0%. Ictal SPECT using the visual method correctly localized the epileptogenic lobe more frequently in patients with a localizing pattern of ictal scalp EEG at the time of radioligand injection. When using subtraction images, an injection delay of less than 20 s after seizure onset was significantly correlated with correct localization. The subtraction method was superior to the visual method for localizing frontal lobe epilepsy (FLE) and parietal lobe epilepsy (PLE), and in patients with non-localizing/non-lateralizing EEG at onset. Conclusions: Ictal SPECT analyses using visual and subtraction methods are useful and complementary for the localization of the epileptogenic foci of neocortical epilepsy. Early radioligand injection and ictal EEG patterns are related to ictal SPECT localization. The subtraction method may be more useful in some epileptic syndromes.

At present, no useful in vivo method exists to selectively measure D2(high) in humans, as current D2 radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET) are either not D2-selective or do not differentiate between D2-high and low-affinity states. The D2 agonist (+)-PHNO[(+)4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine] was labeled with carbon-11 and studied with PET. Eight [C-11]-(+)-PHNO scans were acquired in four healthy volunteers. We observed greatest [C-11]-(+)-PHNO in accumulation in caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus [binding potentials (BPs): 3.00 +/- .4, 3.10 +/- .2, and 4.17 +/- 1.2]. Small but detectable binding was indentified in the substantia nigra/ventrral tegmental area. Preliminary test-retest data in two subjects suggests BP-estimates to be reliable. Pre-treatment with haloperidol reduced BPs in regions showing specific binding with no detectable changes in cerebellum. Parallel imaging with [C-11]-raclopride showed substantial differences in the globus pallidus. [C-11]-(+)-PHNO proved to be a D2/3-receptor agonist-radioligand with good brain uptake and favorable kinetics for PET in humans.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies have been done for several decades, since neuroinflammation has been implicated as an important pathophysiology of several common neurologic disorders. However, despite numerous previous studies with positive findings, its clinical significance is not yet clear. Various attempts to overcome the limitations are ongoing, in order to bring acceptance for use in clinics.

Determination of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28 binding potential <i>in vivo:</i> a first human TSPO blocking study	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						emapunil; [C-11]PBR28; rs6971 polymorphism; specific binding; TSPO; XBD173	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; HUMAN BRAIN; 18 KDA; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; PET RADIOLIGAND; HEALTHY HUMANS; NEUROINFLAMMATION; AFFINITY	Positron emission tomography (PET) targeting the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is used to quantify neuroinflammation. Trans locator protein is expressed throughout the brain, and therefore a classical reference region approach cannot be used to estimate binding potential (BPND). Here, we used blockade' of the TSPO radioligand [C-11]PBR28 with the TSPO ligand XBD173, to determine the non-displaceable volume of distribution (V-ND), and hence estimate the BPND. A total of 26 healthy volunteers, 16 high-affinity binders (HABs) and 10 mixed affinity binders (MABs) underwent a [C-11]PBR28 PET scan with arterial sampling. Six of the HABs received oral XBD173 (10 to 90 mg), 2 hours before a repeat scan. In XBD173-dosed subjects, V-ND was estimated via the occupancy plot. Values of BPND for all subjects were calculated using this V-ND estimate. Total volume of distribution (V-T) of MABs (2.94 +/- 0.31) was lower than V-T of HABs (4.33 +/- 0.29) (P < 0.005). There was dose-dependent occupancy of TSPO by XBD173 (ED50= 0.34 +/- 0.13 mg/kg). The occupancy plot provided a V-ND estimate of 1.98 (1.69, 2.26). Based on these V-ND estimates, BPND for HABs is approximately twice that of MABs, consistent with predictions from in vitro data. Our estimates of [C-11]PBR28 V-ND and hence BPND in the healthy human brain are consistent with in vitro predictions. XBD173 blockade provides a practical means of estimating V-ND for TSPO targeting radioligands.

Evaluation in vitro and in animals of a new <SUP>11</SUP>C-labeled PET radioligand for metabotropic glutamate receptors 1 in brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						mGlu1 receptors; PET; Brain	PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; RADIOSYNTHESIS; EXPOSURE; BINDING; MGLUR1; RAT	Two allosteric modulators of the group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) were evaluated as positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for mGluR1. LY2428703, a full mGluR1 antagonist (IC50 8.9 nM) and partial mGluR5 antagonist (IC50 118 nM), and LSN2606428, a full mGluR1 and mGluR5 antagonist (IC50 35.3 nM and 10.2 nM, respectively) were successfully labeled with C-11 and evaluated as radioligands for mGluR1. The pharmacology of LY2428703 was comprehensively assessed in vitro and in vivo, and its biodistribution was investigated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, and by PET imaging in the rat. In contrast, LSN2606428 was only evaluated in vitro; further evaluation was stopped due to its unfavorable pharmacological properties and binding affinity. C-11-LY2428703 showed promising characteristics, including: (1) high potency for binding to human mGluR1 (IC50 8.9 nM) with no significant affinity for other human mGlu receptors (mGluR2 through mGluR8); (2) binding to brain displaceable by administration of an mGluR1 antagonist; (3) only one major radiometabolite in both plasma and brain, with a negligible brain concentration (with 3.5 % of the total radioactivity in cerebellum) and no receptor affinity; (4) a large specific and displaceable signal in the mGluR1-rich cerebellum with no significant in vivo affinity for mGluR5, as shown by PET studies in rats; and (5) lack of substrate behavior for efflux transporters at the blood-brain barrier, as shown by PET studies conducted in wild-type and knockout mice. C-11-LY2428703, a new PET radioligand for mGluR1 quantification, displayed promising characteristics both in vitro and in vivo in rodents.

Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of the Glycine Transporter-1 Ligand <SUP>11</SUP>C-GSK931145 Determined from Primate and Human Whole-Body PET	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						C-11-GSK931145; Glycine transporter-1; Biodistribution; Radiation dosimetry; PET	RADIOLIGAND	C-11-GSK931145 is a novel radioligand suitable for imaging the glycine transporter 1 (GlyT-1) in brain. In the present study, human dosimetry is estimated from baboon and human biodistribution data. Three baboons and eight healthy human volunteers underwent whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Human dosimetry was estimated using three different region-of-interest (ROI) delineation methods that ranged in their complexity and execution time: ROIs drawn on anterior-posterior compressed PET images, on subsamples of the organs, and covering the whole-organ. Residence times for each organ were calculated as the area under the time-activity curves divided by the injected activity. Radiation dose estimates were calculated from organ residence times using the OLINDA/EXM software package. The overall distribution of activity was similar in baboons and humans. Early scans presented high activity in the liver, and moderate activity in the lungs and kidneys. The principal route of clearance was intestinal and no urinary excretion was observed. The limiting organ with the highest radiation-absorbed dose was the liver. The mean effective dose in humans was 4.02 mu Sv/MBq (male phantom) and 4.95 mu Sv/MBq (female phantom) (ROIs drawn on subsamples of the organs). The human effective dose estimated from baboon data was similar to 15% larger than the effective dose estimated from human data. Human PET imaging of the glycine transporter-1 with C-11-GSK931145 results in a moderate effective human radiation dose, which allows for multiple PET examinations in the same individual. Among the three methods compared to delineate ROIs, the organ subsampling method shows the best balance between quantitative accuracy and practical application.

Evidence for Allosteric Interactions of Antagonist Binding to the Smoothened Receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BASAL-CELL CARCINOMA; HEDGEHOG SIGNALING PATHWAY; SONIC HEDGEHOG; FRACTURE REPAIR; MUTATIONS; TUMORS; EXPRESSION; SYSTEM; SKIN	The Smoothened receptor (Smo) mediates hedgehog (Hh) signaling critical for development, cell growth, and migration, as well as stem cell maintenance. Aberrant Hh signaling pathway activation has been implicated in a variety of cancers, and small-molecule antagonists of Smo have entered human clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of allosteric interactions of agonists and antagonists for Smo. Binding of two radioligands, [H-3]3-chloro-N-[trans-4-(methylamino) cyclohexyl]-N-{[3-(4-pyridinyl)phenyl] methyl}-1-benzothiophene-2-carboxamide (SAG-1.3) (agonist) and [H-3]cyclopamine (antagonist), was characterized using human Smo expressed in human embryonic kidney 293F membranes. We observed full displacement of [H-3]cyclopamine by all Smo agonist and antagonist ligands examined. N-[(1E)-(3,5-Dimethyl-1-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)methylidene]-4-(phenylmethyl)-1-piperazinamine (SANT-1), an antagonist, did not fully inhibit the binding of [H-3]SAG-1.3. In a functional cell-based beta-lactamase reporter gene assay, SANT-1 and N-[3(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-4-chlorophenyl]-3,4,5-tris(ethyloxy)benzamide (SANT-2) fully inhibited 3-chloro-4,7-difluoro-N[trans-4-(methylamino) cyclohexyl]- N-{[3-(4-pyridinyl) phenyl] methyl}1-benzothiophene-2-carboxamide (SAG-1.5)-induced Hh pathway activation. Detailed "Schild-type" radioligand binding analysis with [H-3]SAG-1.3 revealed that two structurally distinct Smoothened receptor antagonists, SANT-1 and SANT-2, bound in a manner consistent with that of allosteric modulation. Our mechanism of action characterization of radioligand binding to Smo combined with functional data provides a better understanding of small-molecule interactions with Smo and their influence on the Hh pathway.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a new somatostatin analogue designed for the labeling with Tc-99m: [6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (HYNIC0), 1-Nal(3), Thr(8)]-octreotide ([HYNIC]-NATE), using ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (EDDA) and tricine as coligands. Methods: Synthesis was preformed on a solid phase using a standard Fmoc strategy. Labeling with Tc-99m was performed at 100 degrees C for 10 min using SnCl2 as a reductant. Radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and high-performance liquid chromatography methods. Peptide conjugate affinity was determined in AR4-2J cell membranes. The internalization and externalization rates were studied in sstr(2)-expressing AR4-2J cells. Biodistribution of radiopeptide was studied in rats bearing the AR4-2J tumor. Results: Radiolabeling was performed at high specific activities, and radiochemical purity was > 95%. Peptide conjugate showed high affinity binding for sstr2. The radioligand showed a moderate and specific internalization into AR4-2J cells (14.13 +/- 0.61 % at 4 h). In animal biodistribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake of radioactivity was observed in somatostatin-receptor-positive organs. After 4 h, uptake in the AR4-2J tumor was 1.33 +/- 0.23%ID/g (percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue). Conclusion: These data show that [Tc-99m/EDDA/tricine/HYNIC] -NATE is a specific radioligand for the somatostatin-receptor-positive tumors and is a suitable candidate for clinical studies.

Kinetic evaluation and test-retest reproducibility of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]UCB-J, a novel radioligand for positron emission tomography imaging of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A in humans	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Brain imaging; kinetic modeling; neurodegeneration; positron emission tomography; synapses/dendrites	PET TRACER; PROTEIN 2A; BINDING-SITE; HUMAN BRAIN; SV2A; LEVETIRACETAM; RADIOTRACER; EXPRESSION; LIGAND	Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is ubiquitously present in presynaptic terminals. Here we report kinetic modeling and test-retest reproducibility assessment of the SV2A positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]UCB-J in humans. Five volunteers were examined twice on the HRRT after bolus injection of [C-11]UCB-J. Arterial blood samples were collected for measurements of radiometabolites and free fraction. Regional time-activity curves were analyzed with 1-tissue (1T) and 2-tissue (2T) compartment models to estimate volumes of distribution (V-T). Parametric maps were generated using the 1T model. [C-11]UCB-J metabolized fairly quickly, with parent fraction of 36 +/- 13% at 15 min after injection. Plasma free fraction was 32 +/- 1%. Regional time-activity curves displayed rapid kinetics and were well described by the 1T model, except for the cerebellum and hippocampus. V-T values estimated with the 2T model were similar to 1T values. Parametric maps were of high quality and V-T values correlated well with time activity curve (TAC)-based estimates. Shortening of acquisition time from 120 min to 60 min had a negligible effect on V-T values. The mean absolute test-retest reproducibility for V-T was 3-9% across regions. In conclusion, [C-11]UCB-J exhibited excellent PET tracer characteristics and has potential as a general purpose tool for measuring synaptic density in neurodegenerative disorders.

Validation of a Na<SUP>+</SUP>-shift binding assay for estimation of the intrinsic efficacy of ligands at the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						Adenosine; A(2A); Bindi; Efficacy; Screening; Na+; GTP-shift	INTERNATIONAL UNION; A(1) RECEPTOR; AFFINITY; AGONISTS; CLASSIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONIST; MONOVALENT; COMPOUND	Introduction: Determination of the intrinsic efficacy of ligands at the A(2A) receptor is important for selecting drug candidates, e.g. in the case of inflammatory diseases where agonists are searched for or in Parkinson disease (antagonists). Methods: Three functional binding assays were compared with up to seven ligands with different efficacies: the GTP-shift method based on the decrease of affinity observed with agonists when GTP is added to the competition binding assay; the K-i ratio method based on the different affinity states of the receptor when using an agonist or antagonist radioligand and the Na+-shift assay based on the difference of affinity of agonists when tested in a medium containing a divalent cation (50 mM MgCl2) favoring the G protein coupled agonist-receptor complex or sodium (100 mM NaCIl) as negative allosteric modulator. Results: The Na+-shift assay proposed herein successfully discriminated the full agonists CGS21680, NECA and adenosine (IC50 ratio = 13-14) from the weak inverse agonists ZM241385 and IBMX (IC50 ratio = 0.85) and the partial agonists LUF5834 and regadenoson (IC50 ratios equal to 3 and 10, respectively). Discussion: We conclude that the Nal-shift assay proposed herein for the A(2A) receptors has been validated and represents a rapid, economic and efficient functional binding assay to be used in a drug development program for early estimation of the intrinsic efficacy of hits.

Striatal Dopamine D1-like Receptor Binding Is Unchanged in Primary Focal Dystonia	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						positron emission tomography; focal dystonia; D1 receptor; [C-11]NNC 112	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; AGE-DEPENDENT DECLINE; HUMAN-BRAIN; DYT1 DYSTONIA; MOUSE MODEL; AUTOMATED ALGORITHM; CERVICAL DYSTONIA; PET; TRANSPORTER; D2	Background: Multiple studies have demonstrated decreases in striatal D2-like (D2, D3) radioligand binding in primary focal dystonias. Although most investigations have focused on D2-specific receptors (D2R), a recent study suggests that the decreased D2-like binding may be due to a D3-specific (D3R) abnormality. However, only limited data exist on the role of D1-specific receptors (D1R) and the D1R-mediated pathways within basal ganglia in dystonia. Metabolic positron emission tomography (PET) data in primary generalized dystonia suggest resting state over activity in the D1R-mediated direct pathway, leading to excessive disinhibition of motor cortical areas. This work investigated whether striatal D1-like receptors are affected in primary focal dystonias. Methods: Striatal-specific (caudate and putamen) binding of the D1-like radioligand [C-11]NNC 112 was measured using PET in 19 patients with primary focal dystonia (cranial, cervical, or arm) and 18 controls. Results: No statistically significant difference was detected in striatal D1-like binding between the two groups. The study had 91% power to detect a 20% difference, indicating that false-negative results were unlikely. Conclusions: Because [C-11]NNC 112 has high affinity for D1-like receptors, very low affinity for D2-like receptors, and minimal sensitivity to endogenous dopamine levels, we conclude that D1-like receptor binding is not impaired in these primary focal dystonias.

Reduced cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor binding in alcohol dependence measured with positron emission tomography	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						alcohol dependence; cannabinoid CB1 receptor; endocannabinoid; imaging; positron emission tomography	ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; ETHANOL INTAKE; BRAIN; ANTAGONIST; WITHDRAWAL; STRESS; RATS; RADIOLIGAND; INHIBITION; ADDICTION	Brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors contribute to alcohol-related behaviors in experimental animals, but their potential role in humans with alcohol dependence is poorly understood. We measured CB1 receptors in alcohol dependent patients in early and protracted abstinence, and in comparison with control subjects without alcohol use disorders, using positron emission tomography and [F-18]FMPEP-d(2), a radioligand for CB1 receptors. We scanned 18 male in-patients with alcohol dependence twice, within 3-7 days of admission from ongoing drinking, and after 2-4 weeks of supervised abstinence. Imaging data were compared with those from 19 age-matched healthy male control subjects. Data were also analyzed for potential influence of a common functional variation (rs2023239) in the CB1 receptor gene (CNR1) that may moderate CB1 receptor density. On the first scan, CB1 receptor binding was 20-30% lower in patients with alcohol dependence than in control subjects in all brain regions and was negatively correlated with years of alcohol abuse. After 2-4 weeks of abstinence, CB1 receptor binding remained similarly reduced in these patients. Irrespective of the diagnostic status, C allele carriers at rs2023239 had higher CB1 receptor binding compared with non-carriers. Alcohol dependence is associated with a widespread reduction of cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding in the human brain and this reduction persists at least 2-4 weeks into abstinence. The correlation of reduced binding with years of alcohol abuse suggests an involvement of CB1 receptors in alcohol dependence in humans.

The aim of this investigation was to test this hypothesis by assessing striatal clopamine D-2 receptor availability using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and the specific D-2 radioligand [I-123]IBZM in first episode, drug-naive, schizophrenic patients and compare it with that in healthy control subjects. Additionally, D-2 radioligand binding was correlated with the extent of psychopathology assessed by specific rating scales including Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Twenty-three acutely ill, treatment-naive, inpatients suffering from a first acute psychosis were studied. Patients were assigned to a psychopathological syndrome-type according to PANSS positive and negative subscale results. The PANSS items delusions, conceptual disorganization, and hallucinatory behaviour were chosen to assess the extent of the acute psychotic syndrome. Patients showed a significantly lower specific [I-123]IBZM binding compared with the control group. Positive and negative syndrome type patients differed significantly with respect to specific IBZM binding. There was a significant negative correlation between IBZM binding and the PANSS item 'hallucinatory behaviour' in patients with pronounced positive symptoms. The data obtained show a significant difference between acute psychotic patients, patients with predominant negative syndrome, and healthy controls, according to the concept of a "hyperdopaminergic state" in psychotic exacerbation.

Recently we have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory actions of adenosine are produced by the involvement of A(2A) and A(3) adenosine receptor subtypes. In human neutrophils A(3) receptors exert their anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting degranulation, chemotaxis and superoxide anion production. Several works have investigated the dependence of prolonged exposure to pulsing electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) on proliferative effects and on cell density. The present paper describes a significant alteration of A(3) adenosine receptor density and functionality in human neutrophils exposed to PEMFs. Saturation binding experiments were performed using a high affinity radioligand antagonist, [H-3]-MRE 3008F20, and revealed a significant increase of A(3) adenosine receptor density in PEMF-treated human neutrophils. A thermodynamic analysis of [H-3]-MRE 3008F20 binding was performed with the aim of obtaining new insights into the effect of PEMFs on the forces driving drug-receptor coupling. Competition of radioligand binding by the high affinity A(3) receptor agonists Cl-IB-MECA and IB-MECA in the absence and in the presence of PEMFs has been performed. In functional assays the effects of Cl-IB-MECA and IB-MECA in the adenylyl cyclase activity, in the superoxide anion production and in calcium release have been evaluated.

Herein we establish a protocol for use of [H-3]NCS-382 by quantitative autoradiography. GHB was used to define non-specific binding, since it displaced [H-3]NCS-382 to an extent equivalent to NCS-382. Among many areas of brain examined, two regions in which high specific binding of [H-3]NCS-382 occurred were the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Areas such as the striatum and nucleus accumbens exhibited intermediate levels of specific binding. No or very low binding was observed in other areas such as the cerebellum and dorsal raphe nucleus. The distribution of GHB binding sites as defined by [H-3]NCS-382 suggests that GHB may play a role in neuromodulation or neurotransmission in frontal brain areas. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

J	Holm, J; Hansen, SI				Holm, J; Hansen, SI			Ligand binding characteristics of two molecular forms, one equipped with a hydrophobic glycosyl phosphatidylinositol tail, of the folate binding protein purified from human milk	BIOSCIENCE REPORTS			English	Article						human milk folate binding protein; two molecular forms, one with a hydrophobic residue; ligand binding characteristics	CELLS	Two molecular forms of the folate binding protein were isolated and purified from human milk by a combination of cation exchange- and affinity chromatography. One protein (27 kDa) was a cleavage product of the other 100 kDa protein as evidenced by N-terminal amino acid sequence homology and a reduction in the molecular size of the latter protein to 27 kDa after cleavage of its hydrophobic glycosylphosphatidylinositol tail by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. High-affinity binding of [H-3] folate was characterized by upward convex Scatchard plots and increasing ligand binding affinity with decreasing concentrations of both proteins. Downward convex Scatchard plots and binding affinities showing no dependence on the protein concentration were, however, observed in highly diluted solutions of both proteins. Radioligand binding was inhibited by folate analogs, and dissociation of radioligand was slow at pH 7.4 but rapid and complete at pH 5.0 and 3.5. Ligand binding quenched the tryptophan fluorescence of the 27 kDa protein suggesting that tryptophan is present at the binding site and/or ligand binding induces a conformation change that affects tryptophan environment in the protein. The 27 kDa protein representing soluble folate binding protein exhibited a greater affinity for ligand binding than the 100 kDa protein which possesses a hydrophobic tail identical to the one that anchors the folate receptor to the cell membrane.

CUB Domain-Containing Protein 1 (CDCP1) Is a Target for Radioligand Therapy in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer, including PSMA Null Disease	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; CLEAVAGE; SURVIVAL; ANTIBODY	Purpose: With the improvement in overall survival with 177Lu-PSMA 617, radioligand therapy (RLT) is now a viable option for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, responses are variable, in part due to low PSMA expression in 30% of patients. Herein, we evaluated whether the cell surface protein CUB domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1) can be exploited to treat mCRPC with RLT, including in PSMA-low subsets. Experimental Design: CDCP1 levels were evaluated using RNA sequencing from 119 mCRPC biopsies. CDCP1 levels were assessed in 17 post-enzalutamide- or abiraterone-treated mCRPC biopsies, 12 patient-derived xenografts (PDX), and prostate cancer cell lines. 4A06, a recombinant human antibody that targets the CDCP1 ectodomain, was labeled with Zr-89 or Lu-177 and tested in tumor-bearing mice. Results: CDCP1 expression was observed in 90% of mCRPC biopsies, including small-cell neuroendocrine (SCNC) and adenocarcinomas with low FOLH1 (PSMA) levels. Fifteen of 17 evaluable mCRPC biopsies (85%) demonstrated membranous CDCP1 expression, and 4 of 17 (23%) had higher CDCP1 H-scores compared with PSMA. CDCP1 was expressed in 10 of 12 PDX samples. B-max values of approximately 22,000, 6,200, and 2,800 fmol/mg were calculated for PC3, DU145, and C4-2B human prostate cancer cells, respectively. Zr-89-4A06 PET detected six human prostate cancer xenografts, including PSMA-low tumors. In Lu-177-4A06 significantly suppressed growth of DU145 and C4-2B xenografts. Conclusions: The data provide the first evidence supporting CDCP1-directed RLT to treat mCRPC. Expanded studies are warranted to determine whether CDCP1 is a viable drug target for patients with mCPRC.

Methods Receptor occupancy was measured by radioligand binding assay in rats pretreated with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), ketoconazole and dexamethasone, and the plasma concentration of midazolam was simultaneously determined. Key findings There was a significant increase in the apparent dissociation constant and decrease in the maximum number of binding sites for specific [3H]flunitrazepam binding after oral administration of midazolam at pharmacologically relevant doses, suggesting that midazolam binds significantly to brain benzodiazepine receptors. Pretreatment with UDCA significantly enhanced the binding. This correlated well with significant enhancement by UDCA of the plasma midazolam concentration. The brain benzodiazepine receptor binding of oral midazolam was significantly enhanced by pretreatment with ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, whereas it was significantly reduced by treatment with dexamethasone, an inducer of this enzyme. These effects paralleled changes in the plasma concentration of midazolam. Conclusions The results indicate that pharmacokinetic changes such as altered CYP3A activity significantly influence the pharmacodynamic effect of midazolam by affecting occupancy of benzodiazepine receptors in the brain. They also suggest in-vivo or ex-vivo time-dependent measurements of receptor occupancy by radioligand binding assay to be a tool for elucidating the pharmacokinetic interaction of benzodiazepines with other agents in pre-clinical and clinical evaluations.

In all, 12 patients with cerebral contusion following TBI were recruited. All patients underwent IMZ SPECT within 1 week after TBI. To investigate the changes in distribution of IMZ in the cortex in the chronic phase, after conventional treatment, patients underwent IMZ SPECT again. A decrease in the accumulation of radioligand for the central benzodiazepine receptor in the cortex corresponding to the contusion revealed with computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were shown on IMZ SPECT in the acute phase in all patients. In 9 of 12 patients (75%), images of IMZ SPECT obtained in the chronic phase of TBI showed that areas with a decreased distribution of IMZ were remarkably reduced in comparison with those obtained in the acute phase. Both CT scans and MRI showed a normal appearance of the cortex morphologically, where the binding potential of IMZ recovered in the chronic phase. Reduced binding potential of radioligand for the central benzodiazepine receptor is considered to be an irreversible reaction; however, in this study, IMZ accumulation in the cortex following TBI was recovered in the chronic phase in several patients. [(123)I] iomazenil SPECT may have a potential to disclose a reversible vulnerability of neurons following TBI.

Examining the binding properties of MK-0974: A CGRP receptor antagonist for the acute treatment of migraine	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Migraine; CGRP; Telcagepant; Radioligand; MK-0974	GENE-RELATED-PEPTIDE; SK-N-MC; BIBN4096BS; POTENT; ARTERIES; HUMANS	Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a neuropeptide that plays a key role in the pathophysiology of migraine headache. MK-0974 (telcagepant) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human and rhesus CGRP receptors and is currently in Phase III clinical studies for the acute treatment of migraine. The pharmacology of MK-0974 has been studied extensively, but there has not been a thorough characterization of its binding properties. Here, we characterize the binding of a tritiated analog of MK-0974 on human neuroblastoma (SK-N-MC) membranes and rhesus cerebellum. [H-3]MK-0974 displayed reversible and saturable binding to both SK-N-MC membranes and rhesus cerebellum with a K-D of 1.9 nM and 1.3 nM, respectively. Agonists and antagonists of the CGRP receptor displaced [H-3]MK-0974 in a concentration-dependent manner in competition binding experiments. Both CGRP and adrenomedullin demonstrated biphasic competition while MK-0974 and the peptide antagonist CGRP(8-37) displaced [H-3]MK-0974 in a monophasic fashion. In competitive binding studies with [H-3]MK-0974 and CGRP, the fraction of high-affinity binding was reduced significantly by incubating the membranes with GTP gamma S. In kinetic binding experiments, the off-rate of [H-3]MK-0974 was determined to be 0.51 min(-1) with a half-life of 1.3 min. In conclusion, the radioligand [H-3]MK-0974 has proven to be a useful tool for studying the binding characteristics of MK-0974 and has broadened our understanding of this promising molecule.

Pharmacologic characterization of novel adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonists in equine neutrophils	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article							IV PHOSPHODIESTERASE INHIBITOR; PERIPHERAL-BLOOD CELLS; CYCLIC-AMP; OXIDATIVE ACTIVITY; INFLAMMATION; ROLIPRAM; CLONING	Objective-To evaluate anti-inflammatory effects of several novel adenosine receptor agonists and to determine their specificity for various adenosine receptor subtypes on neutrophils, cells heterologously expressing equine adenosine receptors, or equine brain membranes. Sample Population-Neutrophils isolated from 8 healthy horses. Procedures-Radioligand binding experiments were performed to compare binding affinities of adenosine receptor agonists to equine adenosine A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptor subtypes. Effects of these agonists on endotoxin-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by equine neutrophils and roles of specific adenosine receptor subtypes and CAMP production in mediating these effects were determined. Results-Radioligand binding experiments yielded a ranked order of affinity for the brain equine A(2A) receptor on the basis of 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the agonists as follows: ATL307 (IC50 = 1.9nM) and ATL313 > ATL309 and ATL310 > ATL202 > 2-([p-2carboxyethyl] phenylethylamino)-5'-N-ethylcarboxyamidoadenosine > 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine. Furthermore, ATL313 had approximately 100-fold greater selectivity for A A over A(1) and A(3) receptors. In functional assays with equine neutrophils, the compounds inhibited endotoxin-induced ROS production and stimulated production of CAMP with the same ranked order of potency. Results of experiments performed with selective adenosine receptor antagonists indicated that functional effects of ATL313 were via stimulation of A(2A) receptors. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results indicated that activation of A, receptors exerted anti-inflammatory effects on equine neutrophils and that stable, highly selective adenosine A(2A) receptor agonists may be developed for use in management of horses and other domestic animals with septic and nonseptic inflammatory diseases.

J	Jin, CY; Panula, P				Jin, CY; Panula, P			The laminar histamine receptor system in human prefrontal cortex suggests multiple levels of histaminergic regulation	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						tuberomamillary nucleus; thalamocortical system; schizophrenia	FAMOTIDINE ADJUNCTIVE PHARMACOTHERAPY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; MESSENGER-RNA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BRAIN HISTAMINE; CORTICAL STRUCTURE; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURON SYSTEM; UP-REGULATION; H-3 RECEPTOR	Human prefrontal cortex is essential for high brain functions and its activity is modulated by multiple neurotransmitters, including histamine. However, the histamine receptors in this brain area have not been systematically studied so far. In situ hybridization and receptor binding autoradiography were employed to map and quantify the mRNA expression and receptor binding of three of the four histamine receptors (H-1, H-2, H-3). mRNA expression and receptor binding of these three histamine receptors displayed characteristic laminar distribution patterns. Both H-1 and H-3 receptor mRNAs were mainly expressed in the deeper layers (H-1 in laminae V and VI; H-1 in lamina V), where most of the corticothalamic projections originate, whereas H-2 receptor mRNA was primarily expressed in the superficial layer II. Receptor ligand binding of these three histamine receptors displayed relatively even distribution patterns throughout the gray matter. However, higher densities of H-1 and H-3 receptor radioligand binding sites were seen in the middle layers III and IV that receive abundant thalamic inputs and where some of the apical dendrites of the deep-layer pyramidal neurons terminate, whereas higher density of H-2 receptor radioligand binding sites was seen in the superficial layers I-III. The results, together with data on histaminergic regulation of thalamic oscillations suggest that histamine regulates both cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical circuits. As histamine receptors are also abundant in thalamus, histamine may be involved also in human diseases of the thalamocortical system. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IBRO.

Since it is known that chronic administration of receptor antagonists causes up-regulation in the targeted receptor, we examined the effects of chronic administration of doxazosin, a nonspecific long acting alpha(1)-AR antagonist, on the properties of alpha(1)-AR subtypes in the rat prostate. Materials and Methods: Rats were treated with doxazosin (2 or 4 mg/kg daily subcutaneously, supplemented with 4 mg/kg daily orally) for 8 or 12 weeks. Prostatic alpha(1)-AR properties at the protein and gene transcript levels were quantified by radioligand receptor binding and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results: Treated rats that received the highest levels of doxazosin had significantly heavier prostates compared with age matched controls. After 12 weeks of treatment radioligand binding studies with radiolabeled alpha(1)-AR antagonist demonstrated no significant differences in the density of total alpha(1)-ARs in the prostate, whereas the results of real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed up-regulation in the mRNA expression levels of all 3 alpha(1)-AR subtypes (alpha(1A), alpha(1B) and alpha(1D)) in the ventral and dorsolateral regions of the rat prostate. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that chronic treatment with doxazosin causes an alteration in the properties of the alpha(1)-AR system in the rat prostate. These findings may provide insight into the long-term effectiveness of alpha(1)-AR antagonists in the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a new somatostatin analogue designed for labeling with Tc-99m: [6-hydrazinopyridine-3-carboxylic acid (HYNIC0), beta-(3-benzothienyl)-Ala (BzThi(3))]-octreotide ([HYNIC]-BOC), using ethylenediamine-N,N'-diacetic acid (EDDA) and tricine as coligands. Synthesis was performed on a solid phase using a standard Fmoc strategy. The HYNIC-peptide conjugate was radiolabeled with Tc-99m and characterized by ITLC and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). In vitro studies were carried out in sstr(2) expressing AR4-2J cell lines. In vivo distribution studies were performed in rats bearing the AR4-2J tumor. The radiolabeled complex could be prepared at high-specific activities and >95% radiochemical yield as determined by HPLC. The peptide conjugate showed high-affinity binding for sstr(2). The radioligand showed high and specific internalization into AR4-2J cells (18.19%+/- 0.21% at 4 hours). In vivo distribution studies in rats bearing tumor have shown a receptor-specific uptake of radioactivity in somatostatin receptor-positive organs. After 4 hours, uptake in the AR4-2J tumor was 1.71%+/- 0.36% injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g). These data show that [Tc-99m/EDDA/Tricine/HYNIC0, BzThi(3)]-octreotide is a specific radioligand for the somatostatin receptor-positive tumors and is a suitable candidate for clinical studies.

Materials and methods: In vitro binding assay of [H-3] pyrilamine was performed using recombinant human histamine H-1 receptors (rhH(1)R). In vivo studies were performed in male ICR mice or Hartley guinea pigs. Drugs were administered orally 1 h before examinations. Determinations were made of histamine-induced skin reaction, ex vivo measured radioligand binding to brain and lung H-1 receptors, pentobarbital-induced sleeping time, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction, and antigen-induced itch-scratch responses (ISRs). Results: TAK-427 inhibited ligand binding to rhH(1)R with an IC50 value of 17.3 nmol/l. TAK-427 inhibited histamine-induced skin reactions in guinea pigs and mice with an ID50 value of 0.884 and 0.450 mg/kg, p.o., respectively; significant inhibition associated with 10 mg/kg of TAK-427 was still observed 24 It after dosing in guinea pigs. TAK-427 showed as high selectivity for peripheral H, receptors as terfenadine and epinastine did, which was evaluated by ex vivo measured radioligand binding. Even at 300 mg/kg, TAK-427 did not affect pentobarbital-induced sleeping time in mice. TAK-427 significantly inhibited PCA in mice and guinea pigs, and also inhibited antigen-induced ISRs in guinea pigs. Conclusions: These results suggest that TAK-427 may have a long-lasting antihistamine activity with minimum sedative side effect and suppress acute phase allergic reactions.

In a first study, we evaluated the brain distribution and kinetics of [F-18]LBT-999, a DAT PET radioligand, in a group of eight healthy subjects. Taking into account the results obtained in healthy volunteers, we wanted to evaluate whether the loss of presynaptic striatal dopaminergic fibers could be estimated, under routine clinical conditions, using [F-18]LBT-999 and a short PET acquisition. Materials and methods:Six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) were compared with eight controls. Eighty-nine minutes of dynamic PET following an intravenous injection of [F-18]LBT-999 were acquired. Using regions of interest for striatal nuclei, substantia nigra (SN), cerebellum, and occipital cortex, defined over each T1 3D MRI, time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained. From TACs, binding potential (BPND) using the simplified reference tissue model and distribution volume ratios (DVRs) using Logan graphical analysis were calculated. Ratios obtained for a 10-min image, acquired between 30 and 40 min post-injection, were also calculated. Cerebellum activity was used as non-specific reference region. Results:In PD patients and as expected, striatal uptake was lower than in controls which is confirmed by BPND, DVR, and ratios calculated for both striatal nuclei and SN, significantly inferior in PD patients compared with controls (p< 0.001). Conclusions:PET with [F-18]LBT-999 could be an alternative to assess dopaminergic presynaptic injury in a clinical environment using a single 10 min acquisition.

With the TSPO (18 kDa translocator protein) positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]PBR28, we monitored longitudinally the inflammatory response post-transient cerebral ischemia in rats, using a recently developed rat stroke model that produces isolated focal cortical infarcts with clinical relevance in size and pathophysiology. Six Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 90 min transient endovascular occlusion of the M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery (M2CAO). Animals were imaged with a nanoScan(A (R)) PET/MRI system at 1, 4, 7 and 14 days after M2CAO with a bolus injection of [C-11]PBR28. In the infarct region, we found a significantly increased uptake of [C-11]PBR28 on day 4, 7 and 14 compared to day 1 as well as compared to the contralateral cortex. No significant increase was detected in the contralateral cortex during the 14 days of imaging. The activation in the infarct region gradually decreased between day 4 and day 14. In an additional group of animals (n = 26), immunofluorescence studies were performed with antibodies for activated microglia/monocytes (Cd11b), phagocytes (Cd68), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and TSPO. The TSPO immunofluorescence signal indicated reactive microgliosis post injury, corresponding to PET findings. The present clinically relevant animal model and TSPO PET ligand appear to be well suited for studies on neuroinflammation after ischemic stroke.

Jeffrey			Relationship between <i>In Vivo</i> Receptor Occupancy and Efficacy of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Subtype 5 Allosteric Modulators with Different <i>In Vitro</i> Binding Profiles	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; MGLU5 RECEPTOR; RAT-BRAIN; PET DATA; DISCOVERY; SITE; RADIOLIGAND; METABOTROPIC-GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR-SUBTYPE-5; 2-METHYL-6-(PHENYLETHYNYL)PYRIDINE	Allosteric modulators of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu(5)) have exciting potential as therapeutic agents for multiple brain disorders. Translational studies with mGlu5 modulators have relied on mGlu(5) allosteric site positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands to assess receptor occupancy in the brain. However, recent structural and modeling studies suggest that closely related mGlu(5) allosteric modulators can bind to overlapping but not identical sites, which could complicate interpretation of in vivo occupancy data, even when PET ligands and drug leads are developed from the same chemical scaffold. We now report that systemic administration of the novel mGlu(5) positive allosteric modulator VU0092273 displaced the structurally related mGlu(5) PET ligand, [F-18]FPEB, with measures of in vivo occupancy that closely aligned with its in vivo efficacy. In contrast, a close analog of VU0092273 and [F-18]FPEB, VUO360172, provided robust efficacy in rodent models in the absence of detectable occupancy. Furthermore, a structurally unrelated mGlu(5) negative allosteric modulator, VU0409106, displayed measures of in vivo occupancy that correlated well with behavioral effects, despite the fact that VU0409106 is structurally unrelated to [I8F]FPEB. Interestingly, all three compounds inhibit radioligand binding to the prototypical MPEP/FPEB allosteric site in vitro. However, VU0092273 and VU0409106 bind to this site in a fully competitive manner, whereas the interaction of VUO360172 is noncompetitive. Thus, while close structural similarity between PET ligands and drug leads does not circumvent issues associated with differential binding to a given target, detailed molecular pharmacology analysis accurately predicts utility of ligand pairs for in vivo occupancy studies.

Nonspecific D2/D3 radioligands do not allow for separate estimation of D2 receptor (D2R) and D3 receptor (D3R) subtypes of the D2 receptor family, which may play different roles in behavior and are distributed differently throughout the brain. These radioligands are also displaceable by endogenous dopamine, confounding interpretation of differences in receptor availability with differing levels of dopamine release. The present study used PET imaging with the D2R-selective radioligand (N-[C-11] methyl)benperidol ([C-11]NMB), which is nondisplaceable by endogenous dopamine, to estimate D2R specific binding (BPND) and its relationship to body mass index (BMI) and age in 15 normal-weight (mean BMI = 22.6 kg/m(2)) and 15 obese (mean BMI = 40.3 kg/m(2)) men and women. Subjects with illnesses or taking medications that interfere with dopamine signaling were excluded. Striatal D2R BPND was calculated using the Logan graphical method with cerebellum as a reference region. D2R BPND estimates were higher in putamen and caudate relative to nucleus accumbens, but did not differ between normal-weight and obese groups. BMI values did not correlate with D2R BPND. Age was negatively correlated with putamen D2R BPND in both groups. These results suggest that altered D2R specific binding is not involved in the pathogenesis of obesity per se and underscore the need for additional studies evaluating the relationship between D3R, dopamine reuptake, or endogenous dopamine release and human obesity.

Analysis of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]methyl-candesartan kinetics in the rat kidney for the assessment of angiotensin II type 1 receptor density in vivo with PET	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						[C-11]methyl-candesartan; AT(1) receptor; Renal imaging; Kinetic modeling; Positron emission tomography; MicroPET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONISTS	Introduction: Angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors play a key role in the regulation of renal and cardiovascular functions and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases. The aim of this study was to assess binding of the novel radioligand [C-11]methyl-candesartan to AT(1) receptors in the rat kidney in vivo with PET. Methods: Dynamic PET images were acquired for 60 min at baseline, with coinjection of candesartan (5 mg/kg), and after injection of PD123,319 (5 mg/kg). Volumes of distribution (R-C.V-T) were estimated with a two-compartment model, by Logan analysis, and by taking the tissue-to-plasma activity ratio at 50-60 min post-injection. Results: The two-compartment model did not describe the kinetics at baseline adequately and the baseline scans were too short to obtain accurate estimates of R-C.V-T with the Logan approach. Based on the tissue-to-plasma ratios, roughly one-third of V-T at baseline could be attributed to AT(1) receptor binding. There were no indications of AT(2) receptor binding in the rat kidney. Conclusion: It may be possible to detect changes in AT(1) receptor density in the rat kidney in vivo with [C-11] methyl-candesartan and PET. Imaging AT(1) receptors with PET may provide valuable information on the role of these receptors in the pathogenesis of diseases such as hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, ventricular remodeling, and heart failure.

We previously reported that tricyclic antidepressants act as agonists at distinct opioid receptors. Here, we investigated the effect of the atypical antidepressant mianserin at cloned and native opioid receptors. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Effects of mianserin were examined in CHO cells transfected with human opioid receptors, C6 glioma cells and rat brain membranes by the use of radioligand binding and functional assays including the stimulation of [35S]GTP?S binding and MAPK phosphorylation. KEY RESULTS Mianserin displayed 12- and 18-fold higher affinity for ?- than mu- and d-opioid receptors respectively. In [35S]GTP?S assays, mianserin selectively activated ?-opioid receptors. The agonist activity was antagonized by the selective ?-opioid blocker nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI). The mianserin analogue mirtazapine also displayed ?-opioid agonist activity. Mianserin and mirtazapine increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation in CHO cells expressing ?-opioid receptors and C6 cells, and these effects were antagonized by nor-BNI. In rat striatum and nucleus accumbens, mianserin stimulated [35S]GTP?S binding in a nor-BNI-sensitive manner with maximal effects lower than those of the full ?-opioid agonists ()-U50,488 and dynorphin A. When combined, mianserin antagonized the effects of the full ?-opioid receptor agonists in [35S]GTP?S assays and reduced the stimulation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by dynorphin A. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS In different cell systems, mianserin directly activates ?-opioid receptors, displaying partial agonist activity at brain receptors. Thus, this property appears to be a common feature of different classes of antidepressants.

Imaging of Fibrogenesis in Patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis with <i>cis</i>-4-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]-Fluoro-L-Proline PET	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PET; Radiopharmaceuticals; IPF; Fibrosis; Proline	COLLAGEN; PATHOGENESIS	Purpose: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal lung disease for which no single diagnostic modality is able to evaluate the activity of the disease process. Cis-4-F-18-fluoro-L-proline (F-18-proline) was shown in animal studies to be a reliable marker for fibrosis formation. We tested this candidate radioligand for imaging of fibrogenesis in patients with IPF. Methods: Five patients with IPF proven by lung biopsy and computed tomography were included. Furthermore, we also included one patient with non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) and scleroderma and one with NSIP and organising pneumonia. Positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition was performed 1, 2 and 3h after injection of 400MBq 18F-proline. We scored F-18-proline activity visually and quantitatively by calculating the activity in the regions of interest over lung, liver and mediastinum. Results: We found low uptake of F-18-proline in the lungs of all patients with IPF. The highest uptake was seen at 2h post-injection, with a decline at 3h past injection. The differences in lung uptake between patients were small, except for one patient with NSIP and organising pneumonia who had a slightly higher F-18-proline uptake. No significant correlations between F-18-proline uptake and clinical parameters were found. Conclusions: Due to the low pulmonary uptake of F-18-proline in patients with IPF, F-18-proline does not seem to be a suitable radioligand to evaluate the activity of fibrosis formation in patients with IPF. The low uptake in the lungs of patients with interstitial fibrosis may be explained by the slow nature of fibrogenesis or to the relatively low dose of proline that can be used.

A comparison of the binding profiles of dextromethorphan, memantine, fluoxetine and amitriptyline: Treatment of involuntary emotional expression disorder	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						involuntary emotional expression disorder; pseudobulbar affect; pathological laughing and crying; sigma receptor; AVP-923	NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; RAT-BRAIN; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SIGMA-RECEPTOR; HIGH-AFFINITY; GUINEA-PIG; SITES; DEXTRORPHAN; RADIOLIGAND; CHANNELS	We compared the binding profiles of medications potentially useful in the treatment of involuntary emotional expression disorder at twenty-six binding sites in rat brain tissue membranes. Sites were chosen based on likelihood of being target sites for the mechanism of action of the agents in treating the disorder or their likelihood in producing side effects experienced by patients treated with psychoactive agents. We used radioligand binding assays employing the most selective labeled ligands available for sites of interest. Concentrations of labeled ligand were used at or below the Ki value of the ligand for the target site. Compounds were initially screened at I AM. For compounds that competed for greater than 20-30% of specific binding at target sites of interest, full concentration curves were constructed. Dextromethorphan, amitriptyline and fluoxetine competed for binding to sigma(1) receptors and to serotonin transporters with high to moderate affinity. Of the target sites tested, these are the most likely to contribute to the therapeutic benefit of the various agents. In addition, all three drugs showed some activity at alpha(2) and 5-HT1B/D sites. Of the drugs tested, dextromethorphan bound to the fewest sites unlikely to be target sites. Although the mechanism of action of dextromethorphan or any drug that has been used in the treatment of involuntary emotional expression disorder is currently unknown, our data support that the affinity of the drug for sigma(1) receptors is consistent with its possible action through this receptor type in controlling symptoms of the disorder.

Measuring dopamine neuromodulation in the thalamus: Using [F-18]fallypride PET to study dopamine release during a spatial attention task	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; RECEPTOR-BINDING; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; D2 RECEPTORS; HUMAN BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; LIGAND; AMPHETAMINE	We used the highly selective D2/D3 dopamine PET radioligand [F-18]fallypride to demonstrate that cognitive task induced dopamine release can be measured in the extrastriatal region of the thalamus, a region containing 10-fold fewer D2 dopamine receptors than the striatum. Human studies were acquired on 8 healthy volunteers using a single [F-18]fallypride injection PET imaging session. A spatial attention task, previously demonstrated to increase FDG uptake in the thalamus, was initiated following a period of radioligand uptake. Thalamic dopamine release was statistically tested by measuring time-dependent alterations in the kinetics (focusing on specific binding) of the [F-18]fallypride using the linearized extension of the simplified reference region model. Voxel-based analysis of the dynamic PET data sets revealed a high correlation (r = 0.86, P = 0.0067) between spatial attention task performance and thalamic dopamine release. Various aspects of the kinetic model were analyzed to address concerns such as blood flow artifacts and model bias, as well as issues with task timing and regional variations in D2/D3 receptor density. In addition to the thalamus, measurement of dopamine neuromodulation using [F-18]fallypride and a single injection PET protocol can be extended to other extrastriatal regions of the brain, such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and regions of the temporal cortex. However, issues of task timing and detection sensitivity will vary depending on regional D2/D3 dopamine receptor density. Measurements of extrastriatal dopamine neuromodulation hold great promise to further our understanding of extrastriatal dopamine involvement in normal cognition and neuropsychiatric pathology.

J	Du, H; He, JY; Wang, SC; He, LC				Du, Hui; He, Jianyu; Wang, Sicen; He, Langchong			Investigation of calcium antagonist-L-type calcium channel interactions by a vascular smooth muscle cell membrane chromatography method	ANALYTICAL AND BIOANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Vascular smooth muscle; Cell membrane chromatography; Frontal analysis; Dissociation equilibrium constant; Binding site	RADIOLIGAND-BINDING ASSAY; AFFINITY-CHROMATOGRAPHY; NONCOMPETITIVE INHIBITORS; STATIONARY PHASES; RATE CONSTANTS; SERUM-ALBUMIN; RECEPTOR; DRUG; TRANSPORTER; ADSORPTION	The dissociation equilibrium constant (K-D) is an important affinity parameter for studying drug-receptor interactions. A vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cell membrane chromatography (CMC) method was developed for determination of the K-D values for calcium antagonist-L-type calcium channel (L-CC) interactions. VSM cells, by means of primary culture with rat thoracic aortas, were used for preparation of the cell membrane stationary phase in the VSM/CMC model. All measurements were performed with spectrophotometric detection (237 nm) at 37 degrees C. The K-D values obtained using frontal analysis were 3.36x10(-6) M for nifedipine, 1.34x10(-6)M for nimodipine, 6.83x10(-7) M for nitrendipine, 1.23x10(-7)M for nicardipine, 1.09x10(-7)M for amlodipine, and 8.51x10(-8)M for verapamil. This affinity rank order obtained from the VSM/CMC method had a strong positive correlation with that obtained from radioligand binding assay. The location of the binding region was examined by displacement experiments using nitrendipine as a mobile-phase additive. It was found that verapamil occupied a class of binding sites on L-CCs different from those occupied by nitrendipine. In addition, nicardipine, amlodipine, and nitrendipine had direct competition at a single common binding site. The studies showed that CMC can be applied to the investigation of drug-receptor interactions.

They have also been demonstrated in ocular tissues by in vitro membrane binding assays. We have investigated whether sigma(1) receptors can be demonstrated in rat eyes by ex vivo autoradiography using [C-11]SA4503, a selcetive radioligand. We also tested whether in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to show sigma, receptors in rabbit eyes. In rats, a high accumulation of [C-11]SA4503 was found in the iris-ciliary body and retina. A carrier-loading experiment showed that the receptor-specific binding of [C-11]SA4503 was approximately 75% of the total binding in the brain. Sigma, receptors were also detected in the projecting terminals of the retina to the superior colliculus. PET showed radioactivity in the anterior segment including the iris-ciliary body and retina, and pretreatment or displacement by a sigma receptor ligand (haloperidol), suggested that the PET signal reflects radioligand-receptor binding. The high density of sigma, receptors in the iris-ciliary body and retina was confirmed by ex vivo autoradiography. in conclusion, the iris-ciliary body and retina are rich in sigma, receptors, and PET may be used to investigate the in vivo distribution of these neuroreceptors.

The 4 compounds (4, 7, 8 and 10) containing a (2-methoxy)phenylpiperazine, moiety displayed hypotensive activity and their affinities for alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1)-adrenoreceptors were determined by radioligand binding assays. Compounds 4, 7, 8 and 10 were also tested for their effect on the pressor responses to epinephrine, norepinephrine, methoxamine, tyramine and DMPP. The results suggest that the hypotensive effect of these compounds is related to their alpha- and beta-adrenolytic properties.

Radiolabeled beta-estradiol is widely used as a radioligand for binding assays. In this present study, the synthesis of [I-131]beta-estradiol has been successfully carried out. Accordingly, the measurement of the radiochemical purity (RCP) value and the presence of chemical impurities are needed. To validate the method for identifying the RCP and chemical impurities from [I-131]beta-estradiol using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The synthesis of [I-131]beta-estradiol was accomplished by a radioiodination reaction, and the RCP was determined by radio-HPLC. The method for beta-estradiol measurement was validated by reversed-phase HPLC radio-analytical employing ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) and radioactive detector. The method for radio-HPLC analysis was validated and established using a C-18 column and MeCN: H2O (55:45 v/v) as the mobile phase. The following conditions were applied: a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min, isocratic, and a UV-Vis detector at 280 nm. The RCP of [I-131]beta-estradiol measured by thin-layer chromatography and radio-HPLC was 99.27% +/- 1.25% and 95.75% +/- 2.41%, respectively. The validation parameters were appropriate and met the requirements for acceptance. HPLC analysis was able to identify the presence of unlabeled estradiol (24.51%-27.29%) in the mixture of [I-131]beta-estradiol. As a result, purification using preparative HPLC or other methods will be required in future studies.

Presynaptic adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors dampen cannabinoid CB1 receptor-mediated inhibition of corticostriatal glutamatergic transmission	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; CONCISE GUIDE; SYNAPTIC MODULATION; BASAL GANGLIA; RELEASE; NEUROTRANSMISSION; PHARMACOLOGY; ACTIVATION; STRIATUM; FACILITATION	Background and PurposeBoth cannabinoid CB1 and adenosine A(2A) receptors (CB1 receptors and A(2A) receptors) control synaptic transmission at corticostriatal synapses, with great therapeutic importance for neurological and psychiatric disorders. A postsynaptic CB1-A(2A) receptor interaction has already been elucidated, but the presynaptic A(2A) receptor-mediated control of presynaptic neuromodulation by CB1 receptors remains to be defined. Because the corticostriatal terminals provide the major input to the basal ganglia, understanding the interactive nature of converging neuromodulation on them will provide us with novel powerful tools to understand the physiology of corticostriatal synaptic transmission and interpret changes associated with pathological conditions. Experimental ApproachPharmacological manipulation of CB1 and A(2A) receptors was carried out in brain nerve terminals isolated from rats and mice, using flow synaptometry, immunoprecipitation, radioligand binding, ATP and glutamate release measurement. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made in horizontal corticostriatal slices. Key ResultsFlow synaptometry showed that A(2A) receptors were extensively co-localized with CB1 receptor-immunopositive corticostriatal terminals and A(2A) receptors co-immunoprecipitated CB1 receptors in these purified terminals. A(2A) receptor activation decreased CB1 receptor radioligand binding and decreased the CB1 receptor-mediated inhibition of high-K+-evoked glutamate release in corticostriatal terminals. Accordingly, A(2A) receptor activation prevented CB1 receptor-mediated paired-pulse facilitation and attenuated the CB1 receptor-mediated inhibition of synaptic transmission in glutamatergic synapses of corticostriatal slices. Conclusions and ImplicationsActivation of presynaptic A(2A) receptors dampened CB1 receptor-mediated inhibition of corticostriatal terminals. This constitutes a thus far unrecognized mechanism to modulate the potent CB1 receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition, allowing frequency-dependent enhancement of synaptic efficacy at corticostriatal synapses.

Species differences in chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide insecticide binding sites in the ryanodine receptor	PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Anthranilic diamides; Binding sites; Insecticides; Phthalic diamides; Ryanodine receptor	DIAMIDE INSECTICIDES; PLUTELLA-XYLOSTELLA; DIAMONDBACK MOTH; IDENTIFICATION; LEPIDOPTERA; RESISTANCE	Anthranilic and phthalic diamides exemplified by chlorantraniliprole (Chlo) or cyantraniliprole (Cyan) and flubendiamide (Flu), respectively, are the newest major chemotype of insecticides with outstanding potency, little or no cross resistance with other classes and low mammalian toxicity. They are activators of the ryanodine (Ry) receptor (RyR)-Ca2+ channel, based on Ca2+ flux and electrophysiology investigations. The goal of this study is to define species differences in the degree and mechanisms of diamide selective action by radioligand specific binding studies at the [H-3]Ry, [H-3]Chlo and [H-3]Flu sites. The [H-3]Ry site is observed in muscle of lobster, rabbit and four insect species (Musca domestica, Apis mellifera, Heliothis virescens and Agrotis ipsilon) whereas the [H-3]Chlo site is evident in the four insects and the [H-3]Flu site in only the two lepidoptera (Agrotis and Heliothis). [H-3]Ry binding is significantly stimulated by Chlo, Cyan and Flu with the insects (except Flu with Musca) but not the lobster and rabbit. [H-3]Chlo binding is stimulated by Ry and Flu in Musca and Apis but not in the lepidoptera, while Flu and Cyan are inhibitory. [H-3]Flu binding is strongly inhibited by Chlo and Cyan in Agrotis and Heliothis. [H-3]Chlo and [H-3]Flu binding are not dependent on added Ca2+ or ATP in Heliothis and Agrotis whereas the other radioligand-receptor combinations are usually enhanced by Ca2+ and ATP. More generally, there are species differences in the Ry, Chlo and Flu binding sites of the RyR that may confer selective toxicity and determine target site cross resistance mechanisms.

Regional quantification of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and β-adrenoceptors in human airways	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						human airway; bronchus; muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR); ss-adrenoceptor; intact segment binding	SMOOTH-MUSCLE; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC VISUALIZATION; CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM; GUINEA-PIG; SUBTYPES; BINDING; LOCALIZATION; LUNG; EXPRESSION; RESPONSES	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) and beta-adrenoceptors in the airways and lungs are clinically important in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. However, the quantitative and qualitative estimation of these receptors by radioligand binding approaches in human airways has not yet been reported because of tissue limitations. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The regional distribution and relative proportion of mAChR and beta-adrenoceptor subtypes were evaluated in human bronchus and lung parenchyma by a tissue segment binding method with [3H]-N-methylscopolamine ([3H]-NMS) for mAChRs and [3H]-CGP-12,177 for beta-adrenoceptors. Functional responses to carbachol and isoprenaline were also analysed in the bronchus. KEY RESULTS The M3 subtype predominantly occurred in the bronchus, but the density decreased from the segmental to subsegmental bronchus, and was absent in lung parenchyma. On the other hand, the M1 subtype occurred in the lung only, and the M2 subtype was distributed ubiquitously in the bronchus and lungs. beta 2-adrenoceptors were increased along the airways, and their densities in the subsegmental bronchus and lung parenchyma were approximately twofold higher than those of mAChRs in the same region. beta 1-adrenoceptors were also detected in lung parenchyma but not in the bronchus. The muscarinic contractions and adrenoceptor relaxations in both bronchial regions were mediated through M3-mAChRs and beta 2-adrenoceptors, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS From the present radioligand binding approach with intact tissue segments, we constructed a distribution map of mAChRs and beta-adrenoceptors in human bronchus and lung parenchyma for the first time, providing important evidence for future pharmacotherapy and new drug development for respiratory disorders.

The purpose of this study was to investigate differences in the serotonin transport system between normal and parkinsonian monkeys using 2-([2-([di-methylamino]methyl)phenyl]thio)-5-[I-123] iodophenyl-amine([I-123]ADAM), a serotonin transporters (SERT) radioligand. The brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was performed on two normal and one parkinsonian monkey. The parkinsonian monkey was induced by bilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the medial forebrain bundle under magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance. Each monkey underwent two [(99)mTc] TRODAT-1 (a dopamine transporters imaging agent) and two [I-123] ADAM brain SPECT scans. After a bolus injection of the radioligand, the SPECT data were acquired over 4 h using a dual-head gamma camera equipped with ultra-high resolution fan-beam collimators. The striatal uptake of [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 was 46% lower in the parkinsonian monkey than those of normal monkeys at 210-240min post-injection. [I-123]ADAM uptake in the midbrain of the parkinsonian monkey was comparable to those of the controls. The uptakes of [ I-123]ADAM in the striatum, thalamus, and frontal cortex of the parkinsonian monkey, were 31%,31%,and 23% lower than those of normal monkeys at 210-240 min post-injection, respectively. Our results suggest that [I-123]ADAM SPECT has potential for evaluating the serotonin transporter changes in human PD. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In studies with tissue segment binding, the hydrophilic radioligand [H-3]-CGP 12177 selectively bound to plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors, and the B,,a, levels were significantly higher than those obtained with homogenate binding. However, both binding approaches revealed similar proportions of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors. The regional distribution of plasma membrane beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in rat hearts were also determined using tissue segment binding. Abundance of beta-adrenoceptors and proportion of beta(1)-adrenoceptors were higher in atria than in ventricle, but there was no significant difference between right and left atria or within ventricle (tight and left ventricle free walls, apex, and interventricular septum). To establish the ability of the tissue segment binding method to study beta-adrenoceptor regulation such as the internalization of receptors, the effect of prolonged exposure of rat ventricle to (-)-isoprenaline was also investigated by using tissue segments and homogenate binding. Incubation with (-)-isoprenaline for I h in vitro caused a concentration-dependent decrease in the density of beta-adrenoceptors, predominantly beta(2)-adrenoceptors, when assessed with tissue segment binding method. In contrast, the subtype-specific change after treatment with (-)-isoprenaline was not detected using homogenate binding. In summary, the tissue segment binding method with [H-3]-CGP12177 enables a more precise quantitation of plasma membrane beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in rat hearts and is suitable for studying their regulation.

The present study compared the binding and functional characteristics of tachykinin NK2 receptors in human detrusor muscle with those in human colon circular muscle. 2. In radioligand binding studies, similar K-D values were observed for tachykinin NK2 receptor radioligands [I-125]neurokinin (NK) A, [I-125]-[ Lys(5), Tyr(I-2)(7), MeLeu(9), Nle(10),] NKA ( 4 - 10) and [H-3]-SR48968 in both human colon circular muscle (0.28 - 1.1 nmol/L) and human bladder detrusor (0.49-0.91 nmol/L), suggesting binding was primarily to tachykinin NK2 receptors. Receptor capacity (B-max) was greater in colon compared with detrusor muscle. 3. In functional studies of isolated smooth muscle contraction, there was an excellent positive correlation between human bladder detrusor and colon circular muscle with respect to in vitro contractile potency (r = 0.97) and maximum responses ( r = 0.98) to tachykinins, selective tachykinin receptor ligands and L-Ala-substituted NKA(4-10) analogues. 4. Species differences between the human and rat tachykinin NK2 receptors were apparent as observed by a low correlation for potency ( r = 0.77) and efficacy ( r = 0.32) of L-Ala-substituted analogues in isolated smooth muscle contractile studies. 5. Minor differences observed in the affinity and potency of NK2 receptor agonists between colon and bladder are dependent on the tissue of interest, the receptor - effector coupling and the presence of other tachykinin receptors. Overall, the NK2 receptors of human colon and urinary bladder smooth muscle appear pharmacologically identical.

In vitro studies have shown down-regulation of beta-AR density in heart failure and cardiac conditions that may lead to heart failure. As in vitro measurements on cardiac tissue samples do not allow longitudinal and regional assessment of myocardial beta-ARs in humans, new methods are being developed to measure beta-ARs in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Studies using PET and the radioligand [C-11]CGP 12177 have shown promising results that are in agreement with those of in vitro studies. However, the radiochemical synthesis of [C-11]CGP 12177 is very demanding, preventing its widespread use. Hence, new radioligands are being developed using simpler methods of radiochemical synthesis. (S)-[C-11]CGP 12388 has been presented as a promising new radioligand. So far, in vivo measurements of beta-AR density using PET have mainly been performed to confirm in vitro studies. Using the full potential of PET, performance of regional measurements and longitudinal studies might add further knowledge on the pathophysiological role of the beta-AR in cardiac disease and the effect of interventions. Furthermore, PET might gain a role in the clinical management of patients with abnormalities of cardiac contractile function.

A significant reduction of the ligand-DATs binding was found in the mice treated with MPTP, but not with TIQ, under the dosage inducing behavioral abnormality and loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells in the substantia nigra. A slight decrease in the ligand-DATs binding was observed in the mice given a larger dose of TIQ. Compensatory up-regulation in the post-synaptic D2Rs was found in the MPTP-treated mice. Pre-treatment with (S)-enantiomer, but not (R)-enantiomer, of 1-MeTIQ prevented the degeneration of DATs to some extent. We concluded that the TIQ-induced parkinsonism model is different from the MPTP-induced model as evaluated by the radioligand-DATs binding and that (S)-1-MeTIQ has a preventing effect for the degeneration of the DATs to a certain extent.

We now report Western blots of imidazoline receptor proteins in hippocampi of subjects with and without depression at the time of death. Methods: Postmortem diagnoses were obtained from 17 cases of Axis I major depressive disorder and 17 cases without Axis I psychopathology. No psychotropic compounds were found in body fluids. Hippocampi were removed sectioned, and assessed histologically. Throughout the analysis, each major depressive disorder sample was paired with a sample from a psychiatrically healthy subject based an equivalent life spans and postmortem delays. The antiserum was identical to that used in previous studies that reported a downregulation of cortical 29/30-kd imidazoline receptor-binding proteins in depression. Results: A triad of imidazoline receptor-binding protein bands (40-50 kd) was detected in the human hippocampus. Subjects with major depressive disorder had significantly less intensity in each imidazoline receptor-binding proteins band compared with central subjects (p =.01 for overall bands). Conclusions: The present results can be aligned with previous reports of downregulation of I-2-radioligand binding sites in both cortices and platelets of depressed patients.

We used the serotonin transporter (SERT) radioligand 3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfaryl)-benzonitril (DASB) and positron emission tomography to examine SERT distribution and changes in early PD subjects. We studied five PD subjects (H & Y 1 to 2.5) and eight normal controls. There is reduced SERT binding in PD. The magnitude of DASB binding reductions was greater in the forebrain than in the brainstem regions. There was no asymmetry of diminished SERT binding. DASB binding in the medulla was relatively spared, inconsistent with the description of early prominent pathologic study in these caudal brainstem nuclei.

Here, we aimed to investigate associations of striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and D-2 receptor availabilities with gray matter (GM) volumes in healthy humans. Positron emission tomography images of D-2 receptor (n = 34) and DAT (n = 17) captured with the specific radioligands [C-11]raclopride and [F-18]FE-PE2I, respectively, were acquired along with T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data in our previous studies, and were re-analyzed in this work. We quantified the binding potentials (BPND) of these radioligands in the limbic, executive, and sensorimotor functional subregions of the striatum. Correlations between the radioligand BPND and regional GM volume were then examined by voxel-based morphometry. In line with the functional and anatomical connectivity, [C-11]raclopride BPND in the limbic striatum was positively correlated with volumes of the uncal/parahippocampal gyrus and adjacent temporal areas. Similarly, we found positive correlations between the BPND of this radioligand in the executive striatum and volumes of the prefrontal cortices and their adjacent areas as well as between the BPND in the sensorimotor striatum and volumes of the somatosensory and supplementary motor areas. By contrast, no significant correlation was found between [F-18]FE-PE2I BPND and regional GM volumes. Our results suggest unique structural and functional corticostriatal associations involving D-2 receptor in healthy humans, which might be partially independent of the nigrostriatal pathway reflected by striatal DAT.

Methods We measured microglial activation using the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO)-binding radioligand [C-11] PK11195 and PET imaging in 10 patients with MS before and after 1 year treatment with natalizumab. Microglial activation was evaluated as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) of the specifically bound radioligand in brain white and gray matter regions of interest. MRI and disability measurements were performed for comparison. Evaluation was performed identically with 11 age-and sex-matched patients with MS who had no MS therapy. Results Natalizumab treatment reduced microglial activation in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM; baseline DVR vs DVR after 1 year of treatment 1.25 vs 1.22, p = 0.014, Wilcoxon) and at the rim of chronic lesions (baseline DVR vs DVR after 1 year of treatment 1.24 vs 1.18, p = 0.014). In patients with MS with no treatment, there was an increase in microglial activation at the rim of chronic lesions (1.23 vs 1.27, p = 0.045). No alteration was observed in microglial activation in gray matter areas. In the untreated patient group, higher microglial activation at baseline was associated with more rapid disability progression during an average of 4 years of follow-up. Conclusions TSPO-PET imaging can be used as a tool to assess longitudinal changes in microglial activation in the NAWM and in the perilesional areas in the MS brain in vivo. Natalizumab treatment reduces the diffuse compartmentalized CNS inflammation related to brain resident innate immune cells.

The role of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> and mGlu2 receptors in the behavioral effects of tryptamine hallucinogens <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyltryptamine and <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-diisopropyltryptamine in rats and mice	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						N,N-diisopropyltryptamine; N,N-dimethyltryptamine; Hallucinogens; Drug discrimination; 5-HT2A; 5-HT2C; mGluR2; Rat	DISCRIMINATIVE STIMULUS; DOSE-RESPONSE; DRUG DISCRIMINATION; BINDING; HUMANS; LSD; LOCALIZATION; AGONISTS	Serotonin 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors are thought to be the primary pharmacological mechanisms for serotonin-mediated hallucinogenic drugs, but recently there has been interest in metabotropic glutamate (mGluR2) receptors as contributors to the mechanism of hallucinogens. The present study assesses the role of these 5-HT and glutamate receptors as molecular targets for two tryptamine hallucinogens, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (DiPT). Drug discrimination, head twitch, and radioligand binding assays were used. A 5-HT2AR inverse agonist (MDL100907), 5-HT2CR antagonist (SB242084), and mGluR2/3 agonist (LY379268) were tested for their ability to attenuate the discriminative stimulus effects of DMT and DiPT; an mGluR2/3 antagonist (LY341495) was tested for potentiation. MDL100907 was used to attenuate head twitches induced by DMT and DiPT. Radioligand binding studies and inosital-1-phosphate (IP-1) accumulation were performed at the 5-HT2CR for DiPT. MDL100907 fully blocked the discriminative stimulus effects of DMT, but only partially blocked DiPT. SB242084 partially attenuated the discriminative stimulus effects of DiPT, but produced minimal attenuation of DMT's effects. LY379268 produced potent, but only partial blockade of the discriminative stimulus effects of DMT. LY341495 facilitated DMT- and DiPT-like effects. Both compounds elicited head twitches (DiPT > DMT) which were blocked by MDL1000907. DiPT was a low-potency full agonist at 5-HT2CR in vitro. The 5-HT2AR likely plays a major role in mediating the effects of both compounds. 5-HT2C and mGluR2 receptors likely modulate the discriminative stimulus effects of both compounds to some degree.

Although several PET imaging agents have been developed for in vivo detection of senile plaques, no PET probe is currently available for selective detection of neurofibrillary tangles in the living human brain. Recently, [F-18]THK-523 was developed as a potential in vivo imaging probe for tau pathology. The purpose of this study was to compare the binding properties of [F-18]THK-523 and other amyloid imaging agents, including PiB, BF-227 and FDDNP, to synthetic protein fibrils and human brain tissue. In vitro radioligand binding assays were conducted using synthetic amyloid beta(42) and K18 Delta K280-tau fibrils. Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of unlabelled compounds at a concentration of 2 mu M. To examine radioligand binding to neuropathological lesions, in vitro autoradiography was conducted using sections of AD brain. [F-18]THK-523 showed higher affinity for tau fibrils than for A beta fibrils, whereas the other probes showed a higher affinity for A beta fibrils. The autoradiographic analysis indicated that [F-18]THK-523 accumulated in the regions containing a high density of tau protein deposits. Conversely, PiB and BF-227 accumulated in the regions containing a high density of A beta plaques. These findings suggest that the unique binding profile of [F-18]THK-523 can be used to identify tau deposits in AD brain.

Predictive value of dopamine transporter SPECT imaging with [<SUP>123</SUP>I]PE2I in patients with subtle parkinsonian symptoms	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Predictive value; Parkinsonism; SPECT; Dopamine transporter	MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; LEWY BODIES; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; I-123-FP-CIT SPECT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DOUBLE-BLIND; DEMENTIA; CRITERIA; BINDING; QUANTIFICATION	Purpose To examine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of dopamine transporter SPECT imaging with a highly dopamine transporter selective radioligand. The study included consecutively enrolled, drug-naive patients with an average short history of parkinsonian motor symptoms, referred for diagnostic scanning. Methods The study group comprised 288 patients naive to antiparkinson treatment who were enrolled as they were admitted for a diagnostic SPECT scan with the radioligand [I-123]-N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-methylphenyl) nortropane (I-123-PE2I). After the diagnostic scanning, patients were followed clinically with an average follow-up of 19.7 +/- 12.5 months. Results A diagnosis could be clinically settled in 189 patients and among these patients, a dopamine transporter scan had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 91% for discrimination between patients with and without striatal neurodegeneration. In cognitively impaired patients (Mini Mental State Examination <27) the specificity was 75% and the sensitivity 95%. A striatal anterior-posterior ratio (APR) of >2 differentiated between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes with a specificity of 84% and a sensitivity of 63%. Conclusion In drug-naive patients with subtle clinical parkinsonian motor symptoms, dopamine transporter scan using I-123-PE21 has a high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing between patients with and without striatal neurodegeneration. The specificity is lower in patients who are also cognitively impaired. Calculation of the striatal APR can assist in differentiating between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes.

Adrenoceptor activity of muscarinic toxins identified from mamba venoms	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						adrenoceptor; muscarinic toxin; receptor ligand; snake venom; three-finger toxin	ADENYLYL-CYCLASE ACTIVITY; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; GREEN MAMBA; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; DENDROASPIS-ANGUSTICEPS; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; 3-FINGER TOXIN; GUINEA-PIG; MT-ALPHA	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Muscarinic toxins (MTs) are snake venom peptides named for their ability to interfere with ligand binding to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Recent data infer that these toxins may have other G-protein-coupled receptor targets than the mAChRs. The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the interactions of MTs with the adrenoceptor family members. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH We studied the interaction of four common MTs, MT1, MT3, MT7 and MT alpha, with cloned receptors expressed in insect cells by radioligand binding. Toxins showing modest to high-affinity interactions with adrenoceptors were additionally tested for effects on functional receptor responses by way of inhibition of agonist-induced Ca2+ increases. KEY RESULTS All MTs behaved non-competitively in radioligand displacement binding. MT1 displayed higher binding affinity for the human alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor (IC50 = 2.3 nM) as compared with muscarinic receptors (IC50 >= 100 nM). MT3 appeared to have a broad spectrum of targets showing high-affinity binding (IC50 = 1-10 nM) to M-4 mAChR, alpha(1A)-, alpha(1D)- and alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors and lower affinity binding (IC50 >= 25 nM) to alpha(1B)-and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors and M-1 mAChR. MT7 did not detectably bind to other receptors than M-1, and MT alpha was specific for the alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor. None of the toxins showed effects on beta(1)- or beta(2)-adrenoceptors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Some of the MTs previously found to interact predominantly with mAChRs were shown to bind with high affinity to selected adrenoceptor subtypes. This renders these peptide toxins useful for engineering selective ligands to target various adrenoceptors.	[Nareoja, K.; Rondinelli, S.; Toivola, D.

I-V KMUP 880602 (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardia responses in pentobarbital-anesthetized. Wistar rats. KMUP 880602 also markedly inhibited both the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol and arterial pressor responses induced by phenylephrine. In isolated guinea pig tissues, KMUP 880602 competitively antagonized (-)isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the atria and tracheal relaxation responses. The apparent pA(2) values KMUP 880602 were 7.24 +/- 0.08 (right atria), 7.42 +/- 0.07 (left atria), and 6.24 +/- 0.06 (trachea). KMUP 880602 also produced a competitive antagonism of norepinephrine-induced contraction in the isolated rat aorta with pA(2) values of 7.64 +/- 0.18. In the radioligand-binding assay, [H-3]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricle and lung tissues and [H-3]prazosin binding to brain membranes were inhibited by KMUP 880602 with pK(i) values of 7.27, 6,08, and 8.25, respectively. In isolated rat thoracic aorta, the vasorelaxant effects of KMUP 880602 on phenylephrine-induced. contractions were attenuated by pretreatment with tetraethylammonium (10(-3) M and charybdotoxin (10(-7) M) but not by glibenclamide, 4-aminopyridine, and apamin. In conclusion, KMUP 880602 is an alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blocker, with selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocking and vascular smooth muscle relaxation activities. Particularly, the vasorelaxant effect of KMUP 880602 is partially mediated by the opening of charybdotoxin-sensitive K+ channel.

[H-3]GR 125743 binding was highest in the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus. Lower levels were detected in the striatum, with the highest densities in the ventromedial parts. In the amygdala, the hippocampus, the septal region and the hypothalamus, lower [H-3]GR 125743 binding was observed. reflecting low densities of 5-HT1B/1D receptors. In the cerebral cortex, binding was similar in most regions, although restricted parts of the medial occipital cortex were markedly more densely labeled. Binding densities were very low in the cerebellar cortex and in the thalamus. Two methods were used to distinguish between the two receptor subtypes, the first using ketanserin to block 5-HT1D receptors and the second using SB 224289 to inhibit 5-HT1B receptor binding. The autoradiograms indicated that in the human brain, the 5-HT1B receptor is much more abundant than the 5-HT1D receptor, which seemed to occur only in low amounts mainly in the ventral pallidum. Although [H-3]GR 125743 is a suitable radioligand to examine the distribution of 5-HT1B receptors in the human brain in vitro, the selectivities of ketanserin and SB 224289 are not sufficiently high to give definite evidence for the occurrence of the 5-HT1D receptor in the human brain.

The regulation of fibroblast growth alter acute myocardial infarction remains to be determined. Recently, Angiotensin II has been demonstrated to be a mitogen for neonatal cardiac fibroblasts. In this study adult rat cardiac fibroblasts were isolated from different regions of the infarcted rat heart and Angiotensin II effects examined. Adult Wistar-rats were sham operated or left coronary artery ligated. After 4 days, hearts were removed and fibroblasts from sham operated, infarct- and non-infarct regions of the left ventricle isolated. Radioligand binding studies were performed and cell number, cell area, total protein, and AT(1) receptor mRNA after stimulation determined. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated that myofibroblasts expressed a single class of high affinity Angiotensin II AT(1) receptors. Myofibroblasts from the infarct area revealed a lower maximal binding capacity, compared to sham operated myocardium. Conversely, myofibroblasts from the non-infarct area had a higher expression of Angiotensin II AT(1) receptor mRNA compared to sham operated myofibroblasts. Angiotensin Il (1 muM, 48 h) increased cell-number in sham operated and non-infarct, but not in infarct myofibroblasts. Angiotensin II elevated total protein in sham operated, non-infarct, and infarct myofibroblasts. In addition, Angiotensin II increased cell area in sham operated and infarct myofibroblasts. These data demonstrate that Angiotensin II acted as a mitogen in sham operated and non-infarct myofibroblasts and stimulated hypertrophy in infarct myofibroblasts. These regional different effects of Angiotensin II might participate in the remodeling post myocardial infarction. J. Cell. Physiol. 187: 326-335, 2001. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In this study, we synthesized and evaluated F-18-labeled FAP inhibitors (FAPIs) for FAP imaging. Two silicon fluoride acceptor (SiFA)-conjugated FAPIs were synthesized: one containing a gamma-carboxy-l-glutamic acid (Gla) residue (1) and another containing two Gla residues (2). Both ligands exhibited high binding affinities for FAP. F-18/F-19 exchange reactions on both ligands were performed in the presence of 2% water. This resulted in the formation of radioligands [F-18]1 and [F-18]2 in high radiochemical yields. Radioligand [F-18]2, with a more favorable partition coefficient, was selected for the U87MG cell binding study, and the results showed FAP-specific binding of the radioligand to the cells. An ex vivo biodistribution study in U87MG tumor-bearing mice 60 min after injection demonstrated a 5.8-fold higher tumor accumulation of [F-18]2 than that of [F-18]1. Furthermore, PET and ex vivo biodistribution studies of [F-18]2 in U87MG tumor-bearing mice showed high and persistent tumor uptake over time, which was significantly blocked by the preinjection of FAPI-04. Our results indicate that [F-18]SiFA-(Gla)(2)-conjugated FAPI ([F-18]2) has the potential for FAP imaging.

However, molecular imaging studies comparing dopamine function between patients and control subjects have yielded conflicting results. Importantly, while all previous investigations focused on the striatum, findings from activation and blood flow studies indicate that prefrontal and limbic brain regions have a central role in the pathophysiology. The objective of this study was to investigate extrastriatal dopamine D2-receptor (D2-R) availability in SAD. We examined 12 SAD patients and 16 healthy controls using positron emission tomography and the high-affinity D2-R radioligand [C-11]FLB457. Parametric images of D2-R binding potential were derived using the Logan graphical method with cerebellum as reference region. Two-tailed one-way independent ANCOVAs, with age as covariate, were used to examine differences in D2-R availability between groups using both region-based and voxel-wise analyses. The region-based analysis showed a medium effect size of higher D2-R levels in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in patients, although this result did not remain significant after correction for multiple comparisons. The voxel-wise comparison revealed elevated D2-R availability in patients within OFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex after correction for multiple comparisons. These preliminary results suggest that an aberrant extrastriatal dopamine system may be part of the disease mechanism in SAD. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The radiolabeled precursor 10-O-desmethyl-dihydrotetrabenazine (10-O-desmethyl-DTBZ) was prepared with a six-step reaction using 3-methoxy-4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde as starting material. 10-C-11-DTBZ was synthesized by heating 1.0mg of 10-hydroxy precursor and C-11-methyl iodide in the presence of 0.3mL of dimethyl sulfoxide and 4.0 mu L of 3N KOH at room temperature for 3min. After purification by solid phase extraction using an alumina Sep-Pak cartridge, the final 10-C-11-DTBZ product was obtained with a radiochemical purity of >99% and an uncorrected radiochemical yield of 18-26% (end of bombardment (EOB), n=6). The overall synthesis time was approximately 20min from the EOB to release of the product for quality control. Using small-animal positron emission tomography (microPET), the striatum of normal rats was found to exhibit symmetrical labeling (STR/STL=0.98 +/- 0.05, n=3) and the highest uptake of radioactivity (striatum/cerebellum, ST/CB=2.89 +/- 0.31 at 30-60min, n=3). In contrast, rats with 6-hydroxydopamine unilateral lesions yielded asymmetrical striatal images with a higher 10-C-11-DTBZ concentration on the unlesioned side (STunlesioned/CB=2.53 +/- 0.18, at 30-60min, n=3) compared with the lesioned side (STlesioned/CB=1.26 +/- 0.10, n=3). These results suggest that 10-C-11-DTBZ may represent a promising PET radiotracer for imaging VMAT2.

The novel selective agonist 1-(1'-(2-methylbenzyl)-1,4'-bipiperidin-4-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-1 (TBPB) displays unprecedented functional selectivity at the M1 mAChR. This functional selectivity has been described to stem from sole interaction with an allosteric site, although the evidence for such a mechanism is equivocal. To delineate TBPB's mechanism of action, several truncated variants of TBPB were synthesized and characterized. Binding experiments with [H-3]N-methylscopolamine at the M-1, M-2, M-3, and M-4 mAChRs revealed radioligand displacement in a manner consistent with a competitive binding mode at the orthosteric site by TBPB and fragment derivatives. Cell-based functional assays of fragment derivatives of TBPB identified both agonistic and antagonistic moieties, one of which, 1-(1-cyclohexylpiperidin-4-yl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-1 (VCP794), lost agonistic selectivity for the M-1 mAChR. Further interaction experiments between TBPB or its antagonist fragments with ACh also indicated a mechanism consistent with competitive binding at mAChRs. However, interaction with an allosteric site by an antagonist fragment of TBPB was demonstrated via its ability to retard radioligand dissociation. To reconcile this dual orthosteric/allosteric pharmacological behavior, we propose that TBPB is a bitopic ligand, interacting with both the orthosteric site and an allosteric site, at the M-1 mAChR. This mechanism may also be the case for other selective agonists for mAChRs, and should be taken into consideration in the profiling and classification of new novel selective agonists for this receptor family.

We set out to determine whether these projections are affected by levodopa treatment in a way that would favor the occurrence of dyskinesia. Methods: As an index of terminal serotonin innervation density, we measured radioligand binding to the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (SERT) in levodopa-treated dyskinetic and nondyskinetic subjects, using brain tissue from both rat and monkey models of Parkinson disease as well as parkinsonian patients. In addition, striatel tissue from dyskinetic rats was used for morphological and ultrastructural analyses of serotonin axon terminals, and for studies of stimulated [(3)H]dopamine release. Results: Across all conditions examined, striatal levels of SERT radioligand binding were significantly elevated in dyskinetic subjects compared to nondyskinetic cases. In the rat striatum, dyskinesiogenic levodopa treatment had induced sprouting of serotonin axon varicosities having a relatively high synaptic incidence. This response was associated with increased depolarization-induced [(3)H]dopamine release and with a stronger release potentiation by brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Interpretation: This study provides the first evidence that L-dopa treatment induces sprouting of serotonin axon terminals, with an increased incidence of synaptic contacts, and a larger activity-dependent potentiation of dopamine release in the dopamine-denervated striatum. Treatment-induced plasticity of the serotonin innervation may therefore represent a previously unappreciated cause of altered dopamine dynamics. These results are important for understanding the mechanisms by which L-dopa pharmacotherapy predisposes to dyskinesia, and for defining biomarkers of motor complications in Parkinsons disease.

We studied the association between obesity and 5-HT by investigating the brain serotonin transporter (SERT) binding in 16 monozygotic twin pairs with varying body mass index (BMI) differences. The radioligand [I-123]nor-beta-CIT was used for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of SERT binding. SERT genotype was also identified for each subject. We hypothesized reduced SERT binding in twins with higher BMI as compared to their leaner co-twins, and increased SERT binding in subjects with LL homozygotes compared to LS heterozygotes and SS homozygotes. In pairwise analyses, twins with higher BMI had higher SERT binding than their leaner co-twins in the hypothalamus/thalamus (specific binding ratios 1.21 +/- 0.23 vs. 1.12 +/- 0.16, p=0.04). The difference was striking in women (1.17 +/- 0.24 vs. 1.04 +/- 0.16, p=0.01), but not in men (1.26 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.22 +/- 0.08, p=0.61). In individuals, no correlation between SERT binding and BMI was evident, and no differences were found in SERT binding between the three SERT genotypes. Our finding suggests an association between acquired obesity and the 5-HT system, particularly in women. However, this association was seen only in twin data, where genetic effects and many shared environmental factors are eliminated. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In binding experiments in vitro, BAP-1 showed excellent affinity for synthetic A beta aggregates. beta-Amyloid plaques in Tg2576 mouse brain were clearly visualized with BAP-1. In addition, the labeling of beta-amyloid plaques was demonstrated in vivo in Tg2576 mice. These results suggest BAP-1 to be a useful fluorescent probe for the optical imaging of cerebral beta-amyloid plaques in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Emerging evidence suggests the important roles of sphingolipid metabolism in diabetes. In particular, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P receptor 2 (S1PR2) have important metabolic functions and are involved in several metabolic diseases. In diabetes, S1PR2 can effectively preserve & beta; cells and improve glucose/insulin tolerance in high-fat diet induced and streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse models. We previously developed a group of potent and selective S1PR2 ligands and radioligands.Methods: In this study, we continued our efforts and characterized our leading S1PR2 radioligand, [11C]TZ34125, in a STZ-induced diabetic mouse model. [11C]TZ34125 was radiosynthesized in an automated synthesis module and in vitro saturation binding assay was performed using recombinant human S1PR2 membrane. In vitro saturation autoradiography analysis was also performed to determine the binding affinity of [11C]TZ34125 against mouse tissues. Type-1 diabetic mouse model was developed following a single high dose of STZ in C57BL/6 mice. Ex vivo biodistribution was performed to evaluate the distribution and amount of [11C]TZ34125 in tissues. In vitro autoradiography analysis was performed to compare the uptake of [11C]TZ34125 between diabetic and control animals in mouse spleen and pancreas.Results: Our in vitro saturation binding assay using [11C]TZ34125 confirmed [11C]TZ34125 is a potent radioligand to recombinant human S1PR2 membrane with a Kd value of 0.9 nM. Saturation autoradiographic analysis showed [11C]TZ34125 has a Kd of 67.5, 45.9, and 25.0 nM to mouse kidney, spleen, and liver tissues respectively. Biodistribution study in STZ-induced diabetic mice showed the uptake of [11C]TZ34125 was significantly elevated in the spleen (-2 fold higher) and pancreas (-1.4 fold higher) compared to normal controls. The increased uptake of [11C]TZ34125 was further confirmed using autoradiographic analysis in the spleen and pancreases of STZ-induced diabetic mice, indicating S1PR2 can potentially act as a biomarker of diabetes in pancreases and inflammation in spleen. Future mechanistic analysis and in vivo quantitative assessment using non-invasive PET imaging in large animal model of diabetes is worthwhile.Conclusions: Overall, our data showed an increased uptake of our lead S1PR2-specific radioligand, [11C]TZ34125, in the spleen and pancreases of STZ-induced diabetic mice, and demonstrated [11C]TZ34125 has a great potential for preclinical and clinical usage for assessment of S1PR2 in diabetes and inflammation.

Spatial Structure and Activity of Synthetic Fragments of Lynx1 and of Nicotinic Receptor Loop C Models	BIOMOLECULES			English	Article						nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; three-finger proteins; peptide fragments; spatial structure; nuclear magnetic resonance; circular dichroism; radioligand assay		Lynx1, membrane-bound protein co-localized with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and regulates their function, is a three-finger protein (TFP) made of three beta-structural loops, similarly to snake venom alpha-neurotoxin TFPs. Since the central loop II of alpha-neurotoxins is involved in binding to nAChRs, we have recently synthesized the fragments of Lynx1 central loop, including those with the disulfide between Cys residues introduced at N- and C-termini, some of them inhibiting muscle-type nAChR similarly to the whole-size water-soluble Lynx1 (ws-Lynx1). Literature shows that the main fragment interacting with TFPs is the C-loop of both nAChRs and acetylcholine binding proteins (AChBPs) while some ligand-binding capacity is preserved by analogs of this loop, for example, by high-affinity peptide HAP. Here we analyzed the structural organization of these peptide models of ligands and receptors and its role in binding. Thus, fragments of Lynx1 loop II, loop C from the Lymnaea stagnalis AChBP and HAP were synthesized in linear and Cys-cyclized forms and structurally (CD and NMR) and functionally (radioligand assay on Torpedo nAChR) characterized. Connecting the C- and N-termini by disulfide in the ws-Lynx1 fragment stabilized its conformation which became similar to the loop II within the H-1-NMR structure of ws-Lynx1, the activity being higher than for starting linear fragment but lower than for peptide with free cysteines. Introduced disulfides did not considerably change the structure of HAP and of loop C fragments, the former preserving high affinity for alpha-bungarotoxin, while, surprisingly, no binding was detected with loop C and its analogs.

A specific mGlu(4) PET radioligand could be an important tool in understanding the role of mGlu(4) in both healthy and disease conditions, and also for the development of new drugs. In this study, we synthesized four new N-(methylthiophenyl)picolinamide derivatives 11-14. Of these ligands, 11 and 14 showed high in vitro binding affinity for mGlu(4) with IC50 values of 3.4 nM and 3.1 nM, respectively, and suitable physicochemical parameters. Compound 11 also showed enhanced metabolic stability and good selectivity to other mGluRs. [C-11]11 and [C-11]14 were radiolabeled using the [C-11] methylation of the thiophenol precursors 20a and 20c with [C-11]CH3I in 19.0% and 34.8% radiochemical yields (RCY), and their specific activities at the end of synthesis (EOS) were 496 +/- 138 GBq/mu mol (n = 6) and 463 +/- 263 GBq/mu mol (n = 4), respectively. The PET studies showed that [C-11]11 accumulated fast into the brain and had higher uptake, slower washout and 25% better contrast than [C-11]2, indicating improved imaging characteristics as PET radiotracer for mGlu(4) compared to [C-11]2. Therefore, [C-11]11 will be a useful radioligand to investigate mGlu(4) in different biological applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The binding characteristics and orientation of a novel radioligand with distinct properties at 5-HT<sub>3</sub>A and 5-HT<sub>3</sub>AB receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Antagonist; Cys-loop; Ion channel; Radioligand; 5-HT3; Agonist	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; SMOKING-CESSATION DRUGS; 5-HT3 RECEPTOR; LIGAND RECOGNITION; RESIDUES; SITE; DOMAIN; LOOP; IDENTIFICATION; GRANISETRON	VUF10166 (2-chloro-3-(4-methyl piperazin-l-yl)quinoxaline) is a ligand that binds with high affinity to 5-HT3 receptors. Here we synthesise [H-3]VUF10166 and characterise its binding properties at 5-HT(3)A and 5-HT(3)AB receptors. At 5-HT(3)A receptors [H-3]VUF10166 displayed saturable binding with a K-d of 0.18 nM. Kinetic measurements gave monophasic association (6.25 x 10(7) M-1 min(-1)) and dissociation (0.01 min(-1)) rates that yielded a similar K-d value (0.16 nM). At 5-HT(3)AB receptors two association (6.15 x 10(-7), 7.23 M-1 min(-1)) and dissociation (0.024, 0.162 min(-1)) rates were seen, yielding K-d values (0.38 nM and 22 nM) that were consistent with values obtained in saturation (K-d = 0.74 nM) and competition (K-i = 37 nM) binding experiments respectively. At both receptor types, specific binding was inhibited by classical 5-HT3 receptor-selective orthosteric ligands (5-HT, allosetron, d-tubocurarine, granisetron, mCPBG, MDL72222, quipazine), but not by non-competitive antagonists (bilobalide, ginkgolide B, picrotoxin) or competitive ligands of other Cys-loop receptors (ACh, bicuculline, glycine, gabazine). To explore VUF10166 ligand-receptor interactions we used in silico modelling and docking, and tested the predictions using site directed mutagenesis. The data suggest that VUF10166 adopts a similar orientation to 5-HT3 receptor agonists bound in AChBP (varenicline) and 5HTBP (5-HT) crystal structures. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, PET radioligands can suffer from non-specific binding to the membrane when ultrafiltraion, which is the most commonly used method for measuring protein binding in PET, is employed. In this study a high-performance frontal analysis (HPFA) method based on incorporation of a gel filtration column (discovery (R) BIO GFC 100, 50 mm x 4.6 mm, 100 A) into a radio-LC system with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 3 ml/min as mobile phase was developed and investigated for four PET radioligands. The minimum injection volume (MIV) of plasma, which is a crucial factor in HPFA, was determined to be 200 mu l (human), 500 mu l (monkey), 700 mu 1 ( human) and 1000 mu l (monkey) for these four radioligands. The MIV values increased as a higher fraction of the radioligand was present in the protein-free form. The protein binding results obtained were in good agreement with ultrafiltration and the method did not suffer from non-specific binding. The short analysis time (<12 min) allowed multiple protein binding measurements during time course of a human [C-11]PBR28 PET study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Comparison of in vivo and ex vivo [<SUP>3</SUP>H]flumazenil binding assays to determine occupancy at the benzodiazepine binding site of rat brain GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						flumazenil (Ro 15-1788); in vivo binding; ex vivo binding; receptor occupancy; dissociation; GABA	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SYSTEM	In the present study, the occupancy of flumazenil (Ro 15-1788; 1-30 mg/kg p.o.) at the benzodiazepine site of rat brain GABA(A) receptors was compared using in vivo and ex vivo binding methodologies with [H-3]flumazenil as the radioligand. Animals either received tracer quanti ties of [H-3]flumazenil 3 min before being killed for the in vivo binding, or were killed and brain homogenates incubated with 1.8 nM [H-3]flumazenil. The flumazenil dose required to inhibit in vivo binding of [H-3]flumazenil by 50% (ID50) was 2.0 mg/kg, which represents the most accurate measure of benzodiazepine site occupancy by flumazenil in vivo. Occupancy measured in crude brain homogenates using the ex vivo method was time dependent with a 3 mg/kg dose giving occupancies of 77% and 12% using 0.5 or 60 min ex vivo incubations times, respectively, presumably due to dissociation from the binding site during the ex vivo incubation. When incubation time was minimised (0.5 min), and despite being under non-equilibrium conditions, the ex vivo method gave an ID50 of 1.5 mg/kg which was not too dissimilar from that observed using in vivo binding (2.0 mg/kg). As expected, ex vivo binding can give an underestimation of receptor occupancy but this can be minimised by careful attention to the kinetics of unlabelled drug and radioligand.

These novel compounds were examined for their monoamine uptake inhibition potency at the human dopamine transporter (hDAT), the human serotonin transporter (hSERT) and the human noradrenalin transporter (hNET), stably expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK). A SAR-study was conducted to determine the contribution of extended, 4-fluorinated, conformationally constrained C-4 chains at the tropane nitrogen to human monoamine transporter affinity and selectivity.

Head-to-head comparison of <SUP>11</SUP>C-PBR28 and <SUP>11</SUP>C-ER176 for quantification of the translocator protein in the human brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						C-11-PBR28; C-11-ER176; TSPO; PET	VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; IN-VIVO; PET RADIOLIGAND; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; HEALTHY HUMANS; TSPO; NEUROINFLAMMATION; SENSITIVITY; BIOMARKER	Introduction(11)C-ER176 is a new PET tracer to quantify the translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker for inflammation. The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison between C-11-ER176 and the widely used C-11-PBR28.MethodsSeven healthy volunteers had a 90-min PET scan and metabolite-corrected arterial input function with C-11-PBR28 in the morning and C-11-ER176 in the afternoon. Binding was quantified at the regional level in terms of V-T with a two-tissue compartmental model. By using V-ND values from the literature obtained with pharmacological blockade, we derived the binding potential BPND for both tracers.Results(11)C-ER176 was more stable in arterial blood than C-11-PBR28 (the percentages of unmetabolized parent in plasma at 90min were 29.08.3% and 8.8 +/- 2.9% respectively). The brain time-activity curves for both tracers were well fitted by the two-tissue model, but C-11-ER176 had higher V-T values than C-11-PBR28 (5.74 +/- 1.54 vs 4.43 +/- 1.99ml/cm(3)) and a lower coefficient of variation. The BPND of C-11-ER176 was more than 4times larger than that of C-11-PBR28 for high-affinity binders, and more than 9 times larger for mixed-affinity binders.Conclusion C-11-ER176 displays a higher binding potential and a smaller variability of V-T values. Thanks to these characteristics, clinical studies performed with C-11-ER176 are expected to have higher statistical power and thus require fewer subjects.

S1PR1-targeting compounds significantly reduce lesion size in murine models of AS. Therefore, characterization of S1PR1 expression in vitro and in vivo in atherosclerotic plaque could enable mechanistic studies and inform S1PR1 targeted therapies. H&E staining and immunostaining studies were performed on variably diseased human femoral endarterectomy plaque specimens, as well as mouse aortic sections from ApoE(-/-) mice maintained on a high-fat diet (AS mice). In vitro autoradiography study in human femoral plaques was used to confirm the tracer specificity. Micro positron emission tomography (PET) and ex vivo autoradiography studies were conducted in AS mice and their controls using a S1PR1-specific radioligand [C-11]TZ3321 for in vivo and ex vivo quantification of S1PR1 expression in mouse aortic plaques. Increased S1PR1 expression was observed in areas of human femoral endarterectomy plaque specimens with foam cell accumulation compared with control tissue; in vitro autoradiography study indicated that SEW2781, a S1PR1 compound was able to reduce the uptake of [C-11]TZ3321 by 56 %. S1PR1 levels were also upregulated in AS mouse aortic plaques. MicroPET data showed the aorta-to-blood tracer uptake ratio in AS mice was approximately 20 % higher than that in controls. Autoradiographic study also revealed elevated tracer accumulation in AS mouse aorta. Upregulated S1PR1 expression in human and mouse atherosclerotic plaques was successfully identified by immunostaining and radioligand-based methods. This data demonstrates that [C-11]TZ3321 PET provides great promise in imaging S1PR1 expression in atherosclerotic plaques.

The first report described the antitumor and side effects of a single dose. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate toxicity and antitumor activity after single and repetitive therapies. Thirty-four men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer received PSMA-RLT with I-131-MIP-1095. Twenty-three patients received a second, and three patients a third dose, timed at PSA progression after an initial response to the preceding therapy. The applied doses were separated in three groups: < 3.5, 3.5-5.0 and > 5.0 GBq. Antitumor and side-effects were analyzed by blood samples and other clinical data. Follow-up was conducted for up to 5 years. The best therapeutic effect was achieved by the first therapy. A PSA decline of >= 50% was achieved in 70.6% of the patients. The second and third therapies were significantly less effective. There was neither an association between the applied activity and PSA response or the time-to-progression. Hematologic toxicities were less prevalent but presented in a higher percentage of patients with increasing number of therapies. After hematologic toxicities, xerostomia was the second most frequent side effect and presented more often and with higher intensity after the second or third therapy. The first dose of RLT with I-131-MIP-1095 presented with low side effects and could significantly reduce the tumor burden in a majority of patients. The second and third therapies were less effective and presented with more frequent and more intense side effects, especially hematologic toxicities and xerostomia.

In a previous study we have shown that mu-opioid (MOP) receptor signaling is impaired in specific brain regions of our three-hit animal model of schizophrenia. Since the cannabinoid system is significantly influenced in schizophrenic patients, in the present work we investigated cannabinoid (CB) receptor binding and G-protein activation in cortical, subcortical and cerebellar regions of control and 'schizophrenic' rats. Cannabinoid agonist (WIN-55,212-2 mesylate) mediated G-protein activation was consistently decreased in all areas tested, and the difference was extremely significant in membranes prepared from the cerebellum. Interestingly, the cerebellar activity of WIN-55,212-2 stimulated G-proteins was substantially higher than those of cerebral cortex and subcortical region in control animals, indicating a primordial role of the cannabinoid system in the cerebellum. At the level of radioligand binding, the affinities of the CB receptors were also markedly decreased in the model animals. Capacity of the [H-3]WIN-55,212-2 binding was only higher in the cerebellum of 'schizophrenic' model rats. Taken together, in all three brain areas of model rats both cannabinoid receptor binding and cannabinoid agonist-mediated G-protein activation were regularly decreased. Our results revealed that besides the opioids, the endocannabinoid - cannabis receptor system also shows impairment in our rat model, increasing its face validity and translational utility.

We examined the ability of AM 251 to inhibit sodium channel-dependent functions and the binding of [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate to sodium channels in mouse brain synaptic preparations. Depolarization of synaptoneurosomes by the sodium channel site 2-specific neurotoxin veratridine, which is abolished by tetrodotoxin, was found to be inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by AM 251 (IC50=8.9 muM). Veratridine-dependent (tetrodotoxin suppressible) release, of L-glutamic acid and GABA from synaptosomes was also reduced by AM 251 [IC(50)s=8.5 muM (L-glutamic acid), 9.2 muM (GABA)]. The binding of the radioligand [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate to site 2 on sodium channels was displaced by AM 251 (IC50=11.2 muM). Scatchard analysis of binding showed that at its IC50, AM 251 increased (by 2.3 times) the K-D of radioligand without altering B-max, suggesting a competitive mechanism of inhibition by AM 251. Kinetic experiments indicated that AM 251 inhibits equilibrium binding by allosterically accelerating the dissociation of the [H-3]-batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate:sodium channel complex. Our data suggest that micromolar concentrations of AM 251 are capable of reducing neuronal excitability and inhibiting release of excitatory and inhibitory transmitters through blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels in brain.

"Selective" Class C G Protein-Coupled Receptor Modulators Are Neutral or Biased mGlu<sub>5</sub> Allosteric Ligands	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; CALCIUM-SENSING RECEPTOR; HEPTAHELICAL DOMAIN; DRUG DISCOVERY; SUBTYPE 5; SITE; BINDING; COOPERATIVITY; ANTAGONISTS; AFFINITY	Numerous positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs) of class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been developed as valuable preclinical pharmacologic tools and therapeutic agents. Although many class C GPCR allosteric modulators have undergone subtype selectivity screening, most assay paradigms have failed to perform rigorous pharmacologic assessment. Using mGlu(5) as a representative class C GPCR, we tested the hypothesis that allosteric modulator selectivity was based on cooperativity rather than affinity. Specifically, we aimed to identify ligands that bound to mGlu(5) but exhibited neutral cooperativity with mGlu(5) agonists. We additionally evaluated the potential for these ligands to exhibit biased pharmacology. Radioligand binding, intracellular calcium (iCa(2+)) mobilization, and inositol monophosphate (IP1) accumulation assays were undertaken in human embryonic kidney cells expressing low levels of rat mGlu(5) (HEK293A-mGlu(5)-low) for diverse allosteric chemotypes. Numerous "non-mGlu(5)" class C GPCR allosteric modulators incompletely displaced allosteric mGlu(5) radioligand [H-3]-methoxy-PEPy binding, consistent with a negative allosteric interaction. Affinity estimates for CPCCOEt (mGlu(1) ligand), PHCCC (mGlu(4) ligand), GS39783 (GABA(B) ligand), AZ12216052 (mGlu(8) ligand), and CGP7930 (GABA(B) ligand) at mGlu5 were within 10-fold of their target receptor. Most class C GPCR allosteric modulators had neutral cooperativity with both orthosteric and allosteric mGlu(5) agonists in functional assays; however, NPS2143 (calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) NAM), cinacalcet (CaSR PAM), CGP7930, and AZ12216052 were partial mGlu(5) agonists for IP1 accumulation, but not iCa(2+) mobilization. By using mGlu(5) as amodel class C GPCR, we find that for many class C GPCR allosteric modulators, subtype selectivity is driven by cooperativity and misinterpreted owing to unappreciated bias.

A covalent antagonist for the human adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptors; A(2A) adenosine receptor; Adenosine; Covalent antagonist; Radioligand binding	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; IRREVERSIBLE ANTAGONIST; CANCER-IMMUNOTHERAPY; HIGH-AFFINITY; T-CELLS; AGONIST; BINDING; DERIVATIVES; ACTIVATION; DISSOCIATION	The structure of the human A(2A) adenosine receptor has been elucidated by X-ray crystallography with a high affinity non-xanthine antagonist, ZM241385, bound to it. This template molecule served as a starting point for the incorporation of reactive moieties that cause the ligand to covalently bind to the receptor. In particular, we incorporated a fluorosulfonyl moiety onto ZM241385, which yielded LUF7445 (4-((3-((7-amino-2-(furan-2-yl)-[1, 2, 4]triazolo[1,5-a][1, 3, 5]triazin-5-yl)amino)propyl)carbamoyl)benzene sulfonyl fluoride). In a radioligand binding assay, LUF7445 acted as a potent antagonist, with an apparent affinity for the hA(2A) receptor in the nanomolar range. Its apparent affinity increased with longer incubation time, suggesting an increasing level of covalent binding over time. An in silico A(2A)-structure-based docking model was used to study the binding mode of LUF7445. This led us to perform site-directed mutagenesis of the A(2A) receptor to probe and validate the target lysine amino acid K153 for covalent binding. Meanwhile, a functional assay combined with wash-out experiments was set up to investigate the efficacy of covalent binding of LUF7445. All these experiments led us to conclude LUF7445 is a valuable molecular tool for further investigating covalent interactions at this receptor. It may also serve as a prototype for a therapeutic approach in which a covalent antagonist may be needed to counteract prolonged and persistent presence of the endogenous ligand adenosine.

Decreased renal AT<sub>1</sub> receptor binding in rats after subtotal nephrectomy: PET study with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FPyKYNE-losartan	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Hypertension; Angiotensin II; PET imaging; F-18-losartan; Chronic kidney disease	CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; ANGIOTENSIN-II; TYPE-1 RECEPTOR; INTRARENAL ANGIOTENSIN; CARDIOVASCULAR OUTCOMES; BLOOD-FLOW; MODEL; LOSARTAN; FAILURE; INJURY	Background: Significant renal mass reduction induced by 5/6 subtotal nephrectomy (Nx) is associated with a chain of events that culminates in hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Numerous studies have provided evidence for the role of angiotensin (Ang) II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) in the promotion and progression of the disease; however, conflicting results were reported on intrarenal AT(1)R levels in CKD models. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 26) underwent Nx or sham operations. Animals were scanned at 8-10 weeks post-surgery with PET using the novel AT1R radioligand [F-18]FPyKYNE-losartan. Radioligand binding was quantified by kidney-to-blood ratio (KBR), standard uptake value (SUV), and distribution volume (DV). After sacrifice, plasma and kidney Ang II levels were measured. Western blot and I-125-[Sar(1), Ile(8)]Ang II autoradiography were performed to assess AT1R expression. Results: At 8-10 weeks post-surgery, Nx rats developed hypertension, elevated plasma creatinine levels, left ventricle hypertrophy, increased myocardial blood flow (MBF), and reduced Ang II levels compared to shams. PET measurements displayed significant decrease in KBR (29 %), SUV (24 %), and DV (22 %) induced by Nx (p < 0.05), and these findings were confirmed by in vitro assays. Conclusions: Reduced renal AT(1)Rs in hypertensive rats measured with [F-18]FPyKYNE-losartan PET at 8-10 weeks following Nx support further use of this non-invasive approach in longitudinal studies to better understand the AT1R role in CKD progression.

In the present study, we synthesized [C-11] MMPIP, a putative radioligand for mGlu7 (binding constant K-B = 30 nM), and evaluated its potential for imaging of mGlu7 via in vitro and in vivo techniques. Methods: [C-11] MMPIP was synthesized by the reaction of phenol precursor 3 with [C-11]CH3I. In vitro autoradiography using [C-11] MMPIP was performed on rat brain sections. To determine in vitro specific binding of [C-11] MMPIP with mGlu7, a blocking study was conducted by co-incubation with excess AMN082, a selective antagonist for mGlu7, or unlabeled MMPIP. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies and ex vivo metabolite analysis were carried out on rat brains. Results: [C-11] MMPIP was obtained with two specific activity (SA) levels of average 58 (conventional) and 3,800 (high SA) GBq/mu mol, respectively. High radioactive signals derived from conventional [C-11] MMPIP in the in vitro autoradiography were seen in the thalamus, medulla oblongata, and striatum, corresponding with comprehensive brain distributions of mGlu7. Co-incubation with ANM082 or unlabeled MMPIP reduced the radioactive signals in the brain sections, respectively. In the PET studies with [C-11] MMPIP, no specific uptake relative to mGlu7 was found in the examined brain regions. Conclusion: Despite in vitro specific binding of [C-11] MMPIP with mGlu7, visualization of mGlu7 in the living brain using PET was not successful. Development of new ligand candidates with higher affinity for mGlu7 is necessary.

These derivatives were synthesized by the cyclization of 7-chloropropylo-8-bromo-1,3-dimethyl- or 1,3-dipropyl xanthine derivatives with corresponding (un)substituted benzylamines. Dipropyl derivatives were obtained under microwave irradiation conditions either. The obtained compounds (1-20) were evaluated for their affinity to adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors, selected compounds were additionally investigated for affinity to the A(3) receptor subtype. The results of the radioligand binding assays to A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors showed that most of the 1,3-dimethyl-9-benzyipyrimidopurinediones exhibited selective affinity to A(2A) receptors at micromolar or submicromolar concentrations (for example, derivative 9 with o-methoxy substituent displayed a K-i value of 0.699 mu M at rat A(2A) receptor with mort than 36-fold selectivity). Contrary to previously described arylpyrimido[2,1-f]purinediones dipropyl derivatives (compounds 15-20) showed affinity to both kinds of receptors increased, however A(1) affinity increased to a larger extent, with the result that A(2A) selectivity was abolished. The best adenosine A(1) receptor ligand was m-chlorobenzyl derivative 18 (K-i = 0.089 mu M and 5-fold A(1) selectivity). Structure-activity relationships were discussed with the analysis of lipophilic and spatial properties of the investigated compounds. Pharmacophore model of adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist was adopted for this purpose. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the doses required therapeutically vary significantly between subjects and it is not understood what determines these differences. Since methylphenidate's therapeutic effects are in part due to increases in extracellular DA secondary to blockade of dopamine transporters (DAT), the variability could reflect differences in levels of DAT blockade. Here we used PET to assess if for a given dose of methylphenidate the differences in DAT blockade account for the variability in methylphenidate-induced increases in extracellular DA. Ten healthy adult subjects were tested before and 60 min after oral methylphenidate (60 mg) with PET to estimate DAT occupancy (with [C-11]cocaine as the radioligand) and levels of extracellular DA (with [C-11]raclopride as the D2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous DA for binding to the receptor). Methylphenidate significantly blocked DAT (60 +/- 11%) and increased extracellular DA in brain (16 +/- 8% reduction in [C-11]raclopride binding in striatum). However, the correlation between methylphenidate-induced DAT blockade and DA increases was not significant. These results indicate that for a given dose of methylphenidate, individual differences in DAT blockade are not the main source for the intersubject variability in MP-induced increases in DA. This finding suggests that individual differences in response to MP are due in part to individual differences in DA release, so that for an equivalent level of DAT blockade, MP would induce smaller DA changes in subjects with low than with high DA cell activity.

Using radioligand analysis, electrophysiology tests, and calcium imaging, we assessed the ability of HAP to interact with nAChR antagonists: long alpha-neurotoxins and alpha-conotoxins. A high affinity of HAP for alpha-bungarotoxin and the absence of its interaction with alpha-cobratoxin and alpha-conotoxins was found. The synthesized analogues of HAP in general retained the properties of the original peptide. Thus, HAP cannot be a model of a ligand-binding site.	[Kasheverov, I. E.; Kryukova, E. V.; Kudryavtsev, D.

Given the increasing use [F-18]-labeled radiotracers, we aimed to determine whether the uptake derived from [F-18]PSMA-1007 PET can also identify responders and to assess its prognostic value relative to established clinical parameters.MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed 103 patients with metastatic, castration-resistant PC who were treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T. We calculated SUVmean, SUVmax, PSMA-avid tumor volume (TV), and total lesion PSMA (defined as PSMA-TV*SUVmean) on pre-therapeutic [F-18]PSMA-1007 PET. Laboratory values for hemoglobin, C-reactive protein (CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (AP) were also collected prior to RLT. We performed univariable Cox regression followed by multivariable and Kaplan-Meier analyses with overall survival (OS) serving as endpoint. Last, we also computed a risk factor (RF) model including all items reaching significance on multivariable analysis to determine whether an increasing number of RFs can improve risk stratification.ResultsA total of 48 patients died and median OS was 16 months. On univariable Cox regression, SUVmean, CRP, LDH, hemoglobin, and the presence of liver metastases were significantly associated with OS. On multivariable Cox regression, the following significant prognostic factors for OS were identified: SUVmean (per unit, HR, 0.91; P = 0.04), the presence of liver metastases (HR, 2.37; P = 0.03), CRP (per mg/dl, HR, 1.13; P = 0.003), and hemoglobin (per g/dl, HR, 0.76; P < 0.01). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significant separation between patients with a SUVmean below or above a median SUVmean of 9.4 (9 vs 19 months, HR 0.57; P = 0.03). Of note, patients with only one RF (median OS not reached) showed longest survival compared to patients with two (11 months; HR 2.43 95% CI 1.07-5.49, P = 0.02) or more than two RFs (7 months; HR 3.37 95% CI 1.62-7.03, P < 0.001).ConclusionA lower SUVmean derived from [F-18]PSMA-1007, higher CRP, lower hemoglobin, and the presence of liver metastases are associated with reduced OS in patients undergoing RLT. An early RF model also demonstrated that an increasing number of those factors is linked to worse outcome, thereby emphasizing the importance of clinical and imaging parameters for adequate risk stratification.

C-11-Pittsburgh compound B (C-11-PiB) and analogs bind to fibrillar A beta. However, levels of nonfibrillar, soluble, aggregates of A beta appear more dynamic during disease progression and more affected by A beta-reducing treatments. The aim of this study was to compare an antibody-based PET ligand targeting nonfibrillar A beta with C-11-PiB after beta-secretase (BACE-1) inhibition in 2 Alzheimer disease mouse models at an advanced stage of A beta pathology. Methods: Transgenic ArcSwe mice (16 mo old) were treated with the BACE-1 inhibitor NB-360 for 2 mo, whereas another group was kept as controls. A third group was analyzed at the age of 16 mo as a baseline. Mice were PET-scanned with C-11-PiB to measure A beta plaque load followed by a scan with the bispecific radioligand I-124-RmAb158-scFv8D3 to investigate nonfibrillar aggregates of A beta. The same study design was then applied to another mouse model, App(NL-G-F). In this case, NB-360 treatment was initiated at the age of 8 mo and animals were scanned with C-11-PiB-PET and I-125-RmAb158-scFv8D3 SPECT. Brain tissue was isolated after scanning, and A beta levels were assessed. Results: I-124-RmAb158-scFv8D3 concentrations measured with PET in hippocampus and thalamus of NB-360-treated ArcSwe mice were similar to those observed in baseline animals and significantly lower than concentrations observed in same-age untreated controls. Reduced I-125-RmAb158-scFv8D3 retention was also observed with SPECT in hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum of NB-360-treated App(NL-G-F) mice. Radioligand in vivo concentrations corresponded to postmortem brain tissue analysis of soluble A beta aggregates. For both models, mice treated with NB-360 did not display a reduced C-11-PiB signal compared with untreated controls, and further, both NB-360 and control mice tended, although not reaching significance, to show higher C-11-PiB signal than the baseline groups. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the ability of an antibody-based radioligand to detect changes in brain A beta levels after anti-A beta therapy in ArcSwe and App(NL-G-F) mice with pronounced A beta pathology. In contrast, the decreased A beta levels could not be quantified with C-11-PiB PET, suggesting that these ligands detect different pools of A beta.

A same-day PET imaging agent for measuring PD-L1 status in primary and metastatic lesions could be important for optimizing drug therapy. Herein, we have evaluated the tumor targeting of an anti-PD-L1 adnectin after F-18-fluorine labeling. Methods: An anti-PD-L1 adnectin was labeled with F-18 in 2 steps. This synthesis featured fluorination of a novel prosthetic group, followed by a copper-free click conjugation to a modified adnectin to generate F-18-BMS-986192. F-18-BMS-986192 was evaluated in tumors using in vitro autoradiography and PET with mice bearing bilateral PD-L1-negative (PD-L1(-)) and PD-L1-positive (PD-L1(+)) subcutaneous tumors. F-18-BMS-986192 was evaluated for distribution, binding, and radiation dosimetry in a healthy cynomolgus monkey. Results: F-18-BMS-986192 bound to human and cynomolgus PD-L1 with a dissociation constant of less than 35 pM, as measured by surface plasmon resonance. This adnectin was labeled with 18F to yield a PET radioligand for assessing PD-L1 expression in vivo. F-18-BMS-986192 bound to tumor tissues as a function of PD-L1 expression determined by immunohistochemistry. Radioligand binding was blocked in a dose-dependent manner. In vivo PET imaging clearly visualized PD-L1 expression in mice implanted with PD-L1(1), L2987 xenograft tumors. Two hours after dosing, a 3.5-fold-higher uptake (2.41 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.82 +/- 0.11 percentage injected dose per gram, P<0.0001) was observed in L2987 than in control HT-29 (PD-L1(-)) tumors. Coadministration of 3 mg/kg ADX_ 5322_ A02 anti-PD-L1 adnectin reduced tumor uptake at 2 h after injection by approximately 70%, whereas HT-29 uptake remained unchanged, demonstrating PD-L1-specific binding. Biodistribution in a nonhuman primate showed binding in the PD-L1-rich spleen, with rapid blood clearance through the kidneys and bladder. Binding in the PD-L1(1) spleen was reduced by coadministration of BMS-986192. Dosimetry estimates indicate that the kidney is the dose-limiting organ, with an estimated human absorbed dose of 2.20E-01 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: (FBMS)-F-18-986192 demonstrated the feasibility of noninvasively imaging the PD-L1 status of tumors by small-animal PET studies. Clinical studies with F-18-BMS-986192 are under way to measure PD-L1 expression in human tumors.	[Donnelly, David J.; Smith, R.

With the increased frequency of these therapies, safe application procedures in combination with effective radiation protection are needed. We present a shielded system which can be universally used for the application of liquid radiopharmaceuticals. Materials and methods The application system consists of a cuboidal box made of lead with stainless steel coating, an inner layer of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), a disposable line/bottle system, and a medical infusion pump. No proprietary disposable parts are used. The system was tested and validated ex-vivo, and evaluated for Lu-177 peptide receptor radionuclide and for radioligand therapies (PRRT, RLT). Results Construction of the application system was performed in accordance with the physical characteristics of the used isotopes. 10 validation procedures with 1 GBq Tc-99m-pertechnetate confirmed functionality. 38 PRRT and 13 RLT procedures were performed successfully and completely. At least 98 % of the prescribed activities were infused. No leakage of radioactivity occurred. Dose rate measurements showed that the radiation in the box is shielded completely, and that exposure arises only from the infusion line outside the box and from the patient. Conclusion The presented application system for intravenous radionuclide therapies is feasible, safe, and cost-efficient. It has been shown that Lu-177-PRRT and -RLT can be performed without complications while ensuring nearly complete infusion of the prescribed radiopharmaceutical dose. Radiation exposure of the applying physician and other staff is low. The construction of the shielding box ensures complete shielding of all radionuclides currently used for radiomolecular therapies.

The phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) enzyme plays a central role in striatal signaling and is implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders involving striatal pathology, such as Huntingtons disease (HD) and schizophrenia. Inhibition of PDE10A activates the neurons in the striatum and consequently leads to alteration of behavioral aspects modulated by the striatal circuit. [F-18]MNI-659, (2-(2-(3-(4-(2-[F-18]fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-7-methyl-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-isopropoxyisoindoline-1,3-dione), is a newly developed PET radioligand that shows a high binding to PDE10A in the human brain in vivo. In the present study, we examined the in vitro binding of [F-18]MNI-659 in human postmortem brain to gain a better understanding of the presence, density, disease-related alterations and therapy related to changes in PDE10A expression. The results show high specific binding of [F-18]MNI-659 in the caudate nucleus, putamen and the hippocampal formation. Low specific [F-18] MNI-659 binding was detected in nucleus accumbens in comparison to the caudate nucleus and putamen. In vitro binding studies with [F-18]MNI-659 will facilitate in elucidating better understanding of the role of PDE10A activity in health and disease that may lead to new diagnostic opportunities in HD.

The 5-HT1B receptor is thought to have a regulatory role in a number of physiological functions, and has been implicated in several age-related diseases. The purpose of the present study was to examine if the availability of 5-HT1B receptors is decreasing with age in healthy subjects. Methods: Data from five previous studies were reanalyzed and pooled, generating data from fifty-one healthy subjects, age 20 to 70, that had been examined with positron emission tomography (PET) and the 5-HT1B specific radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 at baseline conditions. The binding potential (BPND) in cortical and subcortical areas was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). After correction for partial volume effects (PVEc), the correlation between age and regional BPND was examined. Results: A statistically significant negative correlation between age and BPND was obtained for neocortical regions and the ventral striatum (VST). The average reduction in BPND per decade was 8% in cortex and 4% in VST. The BPND in the caudate nucleus and the putamen was mainly unaffected by age. Conclusion: The 5-HT1B receptor availability decreases by age in cortical regions, whereas it remains stable in the caudate nucleus and putamen. By consequence, age-matching of control subjects will be necessary in future clinical studies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Gordon			In Vivo Evidence for Low Striatal Vesicular Monoamine Transporter 2 (VMAT2) Availability in Cocaine Abusers	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOPAMINERGIC DRUG TREATMENTS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; AMPHETAMINE ACTION; USERS; TRANSMISSION; RELEASE; NEURONS; PET; SENSITIZATION	Objective: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in cocaine abusers have shown that low dopamine release in the striatum following an amphetamine challenge is associated with higher relapse rates. One possible mechanism that might lead to lower amphetamine-induced dopamine release is low availability of dopamine storage vesicles in the presynaptic terminals for release. Consistent with this hypothesis, postmortem studies have shown low levels of vesicular monoamine transporter, type 2 (VMAT2), the membrane protein that regulates the size of the vesicular dopamine pool, in cocaine abusers relative to healthy subjects. To confirm the postmortem findings, the authors used PET and the VMAT2 radioligand [(11)C]-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) to assess the in vivo VMAT2 availability in a group of 12 recently abstinent cocaine-dependent subjects and matched healthy comparison subjects. Method: [(11)C]DTBZ nondisplaceable binding potential (BP(ND)) was measured by kinetic analysis using the arterial input function or, if arterial input was unavailable, by the simplified reference tissue method. Results: [(11)C]DTBZ BP(ND) was significantly lower in the cocaine abusers than in the comparison subjects in the limbic striatum (10.0% lower), associative striatum (-13.4%), and sensorimotor striatum (-11.5%). Conclusions: The results of this in vivo PET study confirm previous in vitro reports of low VMAT2 availability in the striatum of cocaine abusers. It also suggests a compensatory down-regulation of the dopamine storage vesicles in response to chronic cocaine abuse and/or a loss of dopaminergic terminals. Further research is necessary to understand the clinical relevance of this observation to relapse and outcome in abstinent cocaine abusers.

[F-18] fallypride is the first PET radioligand that allows measurement of the effects of amphetamine on D2/D3 ligand binding in striatum and extra-striatal brain regions in a single scanning session following amphetamine. We scanned 15 healthy volunteer subjects with [F-18] fallypride at baseline and following amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg) using arterial plasma input-based modeling as well as reference region methods. We found that amphetamine effect was robustly detected in ventral striatum, globus pallidus, and posterior putamen, and with slightly higher variability in other striatal subregions. However, the observed effect sizes in striatum were less than those observed in previous studies in our laboratory using [C-11] raclopride. Robust effect was also detected in limbic extra-striatal regions (hippocampus, amygdala) and substantia nigra, but the signal-to-noise ratio was too low to allow accurate measurement in cortical regions. We conclude that [F-18] fallypride is a suitable ligand for measuring amphetamine effect in striatum and limbic regions, but it is not suitable for measuring the effect in cortical regions and may not provide the most powerful way to measure the effect in striatum.

Translocation of the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase to the cell surface:: detection by radioligand binding	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						angiotensin IV; IRAP; translocation; radioligand binding; insulin; adipocytes	RESPONSIVE AMINOPEPTIDASE; CYSTINYL AMINOPEPTIDASE; GLUT4 TRANSLOCATION; AT(4) RECEPTOR; MEMBRANE AMINOPEPTIDASE; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; ANGIOTENSIN-IV; AMINO-ACIDS; PROTEIN; 3T3-L1	Background and purpose: Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase ( IRAP) and the insulin-dependent glucose transporter GLUT4 colocalize in specific intracellular vesicles (that is, GLUT4 vesicles). These vesicles move slowly to the cell surface, but their translocation is markedly enhanced by insulin, resulting in higher glucose uptake. Previous studies of the insulin-mediated translocation of IRAP to the cell surface have been hampered by the laborious detection of IRAP at the cell surface. We aimed to develop a more direct and faster method to detect IRAP. To this end, we used model systems with well-characterized IRAP: CHO-K1 cells expressing endogenous IRAP and recombinant HEK293 cells expressing human IRAP. A more widespread application of the method was demonstrated by the use of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Experimental approach: After stimulation of the cells with insulin, internalization of IRAP was inhibited by the addition of phenyl arsine oxide (PAO). Then, cell-surface IRAP was detected by the high-affinity binding of radiolabelled angiotensin (Ang) IV (either I-125 or H-3). Key Results: We monitored the time- and concentration dependence of insulin-mediated translocation of IRAP in both cell lines and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. A plateau was reached between 6 and 8 min, and 10(-7) M insulin led to the highest amount of IRAP at the cell surface. Conclusions and implications: Based on the capacity of the IRAP apoenzyme to display high affinity for radiolabelled Ang IV and on the ability of PAO to inhibit IRAP internalization, we developed a more direct and faster method to measure insulin-mediated translocation of IRAP to the cell surface.

Neurokinin-3 receptor-specific antagonists talnetant and osanetant show distinct mode of action in cellular Ca<SUP>2+</SUP> mobilization but display similar binding kinetics and identical mechanism of binding in ligand cross-competition	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							GAMMA-SECRETASE; TACHYKININ; SELECTIVITY; DEPRESSION; POTENT; SITES	Talnetant and osanetant, two structurally diverse antagonists of neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3), displayed distinct modes of action in Ca2+ mobilization. Although talnetant showed a normal Schild plot with a slope close to unity and a K-b similar to its K-i value in binding, osanetant presented an aberrant Schild with a steep slope (3.3 +/- 0.5) and a K-b value (12 nM) significantly elevated compared with its K-i value (0.8 nM) in binding. Kinetic binding experiments indicated a simple one-step binding mechanism with relatively fast on- and off-rates for both antagonists, arguing against slow onset of antagonism as the reason for abnormal Schild. This conclusion was supported by prolonged preincubation of antagonist that failed to improve the observed aberrant Schild. In ligand cross-competition binding, both talnetant and osanetant displayed linear reciprocal plots of identical slope when [MePhe(7)] neurokinin B (NKB) was used as the other competition partner with I-125-[MePhe(7)] NKB as the radioligand, indicating competitive binding of either antagonist with regard to [MePhe(7)] NKB. Similar patterns were obtained when talnetant was tested against osanetant, indicating competitive binding between the two antagonists as well. These results were reproduced when [H-3]4-quinolinecarboxamide (SB222200), a close derivative of talnetant, was used as the radioligand. Taken together, these data strongly suggest binding of both talnetant and osanetant at the orthosteric binding site with similar kinetic properties and do not support the hypothesis that the aberrant Schild observed in functional assays for osanetant is derived from differences in the mechanism of binding for these NK3 antagonists.

However, changes in cardiac beta(2)- adrenoceptors vary. With suitable radiopharmoceuticols single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) offer the opportunity to assess beta-adrenoceptors non-invasively. Among the novel racemic analogues of the established beta(1)-selective odrenoceptor antagonist ICI 89.406 the iodinated 2-I-ICI-H showed high affinity and selectivity to beta(1)-adrenoceptors in murine ventricular membranes. The aim of this study was its evaluation as a putative subtype selective beta(1)-adrenergic radioligand in cardiac imaging. Methods: Competition studies in vitro and in vivo were used to investigate the kinetics of 2-I-ICI-H binding to cardiac beta-adrenoceptors in mice and rots. In addition, the radiosynthesis of 2-I-125-ICI-H from the silylated precursor 2-SiMe3-ICI-H was established. The specific activity was 80 GBq/pmol, the radiochemical yield ranged from 70 to 80%. Results: The unlabelled compound 2-I-ICI-H showed high beta(1)-selectivity and -affinity in the in vitro competition studies. In vivo biodistribution studies apparently showed low affinity to cardiac beta-adrenoceptors. The radiolabelled counterpart 2-I-125-ICI-H showed a high degree of non-specific binding in vitro and no specific binding to cardiac beta(1)-adrenoceptors in vivo. Conclusion: Because of its high non-specific binding 2-I-125-ICI-H is no suitable radiotrocer for imaging in vivo.

The presence of the equilibrative es and ei nucleoside transporters at the BBB was also determined. Studies were conducted in an experimental in vitro BBB model comprising bovine brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) and rat astrocytes (RAs). The presence of the receptors and transporters was investigated by a combination of RT-PCR and radioligand binding assays. Changes in paracellular permeability were investigated on basis of changes in traps-endothelial-electrical-resistance (TEER) and transport of paracellular markers. In BCECs the presence of A(2A) and A(3) receptors and the es nucleoside transporter was demonstrated. The At receptor was absent, while the presence of the A,B receptor and the ei nucleoside transporter remained uncertain. In RAs the presence of all four receptor subtypes and the es and ei nucleoside transporters was demonstrated. Upon application of selective agonists no significant changes in TEER or the transport of the paracellular markers were observed. The functional role of adenosine receptor subtypes in regulating the paracellular permeability of the BBB is probably small. It is unlikely therefore that the BBB transport of synthetic adenosine analogues is modified by permeability changes. The es nucleoside transporter might play a role in the BBB transport of synthetic adenosine analogues. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

While adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor subtypes have been pharmacologically characterized through the use of selective ligands, the A(2B) and A(3) adenosine receptor subtypes are presently under study in order to better understand their physio-pathological functions. In particular, activation of adenosine A(3) receptors has been shown to stimulate phospholipase C and D and to inhibit adenylate cyclase. Activation of A(3) adenosine receptors also causes the release of inflammatory, mediators such as histamine from mast cells, which are responsible for processes such as inflammation and hypotension. For these reasons, it has been suggested that A(3) adenosine receptor antagonists can be considered potential drugs for the treatment of asthma and inflammation. In the last few years different classes of heterocyclic compounds have been identified as A(3) adenosine antagonists, but none of the tested compounds showed significant selectivity for A(3) adenosine receptor subtype. Herein, we report our recent results on a class of pyrazolo[4,3-e]1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine derivatives as a new class of potent and selective human A(3) adenosine receptor antagonists. The full characterization of the first high-affinity radioligand antagonist for this receptor subtype, designated [H-3] MRE3008F20, is briefly summarized. Drug Dev. Res. 52:406-415, 2001.

The aim of this study was to develop a method for the quantitative imaging of 5-HT1A receptors in healthy volunteers with [F-18]p-MPPF. After injection of [F-18]p-MPPF radioactivity was rapidly taken up in the brain, with the highest accumulation in the medial temporal cortex. Low levels of radioactivity were found in cerebellum and basal ganglia. Plasma clearance and metabolism of [F-18]p-MPPF resulted in only about 1% of the radioactivity in plasma as parent radioligand after 10 min. Using a linear graphical method (Logan-Patlak), binding potentials were calculated in several brain areas. A good correlation (r = 0.95) was found between the obtained binding potentials and literature values for 5-HT1A receptor densities. A good correlation (r = 0.96) was also found between the body weight-corrected region/cerebellum ratios and the respective binding potentials. Moreover, a blocking experiment with pindolol (n = 3) showed a decrease of 40% in the region/cerebellum ratios of the target areas. Compared to those of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635, the binding potentials were four to six times lower, indicating that [F-18]p-MPPF has a lower in vivo affinity for 5-HT1A receptors. In conclusion, [F-18]p-MPPF can be used for the quantitative analysis of 5-HT1A receptor distribution in human brain. NUCL MED BIOL 27;5:473-476, 2000. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Evaluation of <SUP>11</SUP>C-GSK189254 as a Novel Radioligand for the H<sub>3</sub> Receptor in Humans Using PET	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neurology; PET; radiopharmaceuticals; brain; GSK189254; H-3 receptor; human	HISTAMINE; BRAIN; H-3-RECEPTOR; PERFORMANCE; ANTAGONIST; RELEASE; LIGANDS; AGONIST	The histamine H-3 receptor is implicated in the pathophysiology of several central nervous system disorders. N-methyl-6-(3-cyclobutyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-benzo[d]azepin-7-yloxy)-nicotamide (GSK189254) is a highly potent, selective, and brain-penetrant H-3 receptor antagonist. Previous studies in the pig using PET have shown that C-11-GSK189254 uptake in H-3-rich regions of the brain can be blocked by the selective H-3 antagonist ciproxifan. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate C-11-GSK189254 as a PET radioligand for human studies and to determine the dose-receptor occupancy relationship of GSK189254 in the human brain. Methods: Dynamic PET scans were obtained in healthy subjects over 90 min after intravenous administration of approximately 370 MBq of C-11-GSK189254. Blood samples were taken throughout the scans to derive the arterial plasma parent input function. Each subject was scanned twice, either with tracer alone (test-retest) or before and after a single oral dose of GSK189254 (10-100 mu g). Data were analyzed by compartmental analysis, and regional receptor-occupancy estimates were obtained by graphical analysis of changes in the total volumes of distribution (V-T) of the radioligand. Results: C-11-GSK189254 readily entered the brain; its regional brain distribution reflected the known distribution of H-3 receptors, with high binding in the caudate and putamen, intermediate binding in cortical regions, and low binding in the cerebellum. GSK189254 displayed a high receptor affinity, and a marked reduction in V-T was apparent at all the doses tested. The oral dose equaling 50% occupancy of the available receptor sites (ED50) was estimated as 4.33 mu g. Additional data on plasma pharmacokinetics after oral dosing and the plasma free fraction gave a corresponding estimate of the free concentration of GSK189254 required to occupy 50% of the available receptor sites (EC50) (0.011 nM). The test-retest data showed reductions in regional V-T on the second scan in all subjects. A nonlinear compartmental analysis of this effect demonstrated that this reduction was consistent with carryover of a tracer mass dose effect with an estimated in vivo apparent dissociation constant of 0.010 nM, close to the independent estimate of the plasma EC50. Conclusion: C-11-GSK189254 can be used to quantify H-3 receptor availability in humans in vivo using PET but requires high specific activity; the possibility of tracer mass dose effects should be carefully analyzed.

An improved, high-efficiency assay for assessing serum anticholinergic activity using cultured cells stably expressing M1 receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						Anticholinergic burden; [H-3]QNB; [H-3]NMS; M1 receptor; M1WT3 cell line; SAA	MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; OLDER-PEOPLE; DRUG BURDEN; ACETYLCHOLINE; BRAIN; ASSOCIATION; OUTCOMES; SCALES	Assessments of total anticholinergic activity (SAA) in serum are of considerable interest for its potential involvement in cognitive impairment associated with polydrug states in the elderly and other populations. Such estimations have been based on the displacement of radioligand binding in rat brain tissues. The validity of such measurements has been questioned, as a potentially distorting effect of large serum proteins was identified. We sought to develop a modified assay that would be more efficient and free of this potential confound. Cultured CHO cells stably expressing M1 receptors M1WT3 were used. Binding of H-3-radioligands was conducted in 96-well plates and tested in serumcontaining known amounts of anticholinergic medications. Effects of endogenous serum proteins were assessed by pre-assay filtration and also by deproteinization with perchloric acid (PCA). Binding of [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([H-3]QNB) or [H-3]N-methyl-scopolamine ([H-3]NMS) to M1WT3 cells proved reliable and equally sensitive to varying concentrations of anticholinergic agents. In agreement with previous findings (Cox, Kwatra, Shetty, & Kwatra, 2009), filtration of proteins heavier than 50 kDa essentially reduced SAA values to zero. In contrast, PCA preserved more than 70% of the binding seen untreated cell membranes. Cell-based assays also showed significant signal increases compared to the conventional rat brain-based protocol. Further advantages of the cell-based protocol described here include increased sensitivity and reliability, smaller amounts of radioligand needed, and higher throughput. PCA pretreatment eliminates potential artifacts attributable to serum proteins. This step, together with improvements in efficiency, should contribute significantly to the usefulness of the assay.

Quantification of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the human brain with PET:: Bolus plus infusion administration of 2-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]F-A85380	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; PARKINSON-DISEASE; BINDING; NONSMOKERS; SMOKERS; NEURORECEPTOR; EQUILIBRIUM; ALPHA4BETA2; DENSITY	Quantitative analysis of most positron emission tomography (PET) data requires arterial blood sampling and dynamic scanning when the radioligand is administered as a bolus injection. Less invasive studies can be accomplished if the radioligand is administered as a bolus plus constant infusion (B/I). The purpose of the current study was to evaluate a B/I paradigm for quantifying high affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with PET and 2-[F-18]F-A85380 (2FA). Seven volunteers underwent a study in which 2FA was administered as a bolus injection and another study in which the 2FA was administered by B/I (Kbolus = 500 min). We evaluated the feasibility of using scans of a 2 h duration starting 6 h after the start of the 2FA administration and data from venous blood. Radioactivity in the brain and in arterial and venous plasma reached steady state by 6 h. Volumes of distribution (V-T) calculated from the ratio of radioactivity in the brain areas of interest to the radioactivity corresponding to unbound, unmetabolized 2FA in venous plasma at steady state in the B/I studies were very similar to those calculated from time activity curves of unbound, unmetabolized 2FA in arterial plasma and regional brain radioactivity from 8-h dynamic scans after bolus administration of 2FA. The results of repeated PET studies with 2FA showed a high reproducibility of V-T, measurements. We conclude that B/I methodology will be useful for clinical and research studies of brain nAChRs.

Recent studies had demonstrated that serum and mesangial IgA1 in IgAN were deglycosylated and IgA1 could bind to human mesangial cells (HMC) through a novel receptor. The aim of the current study is to investigate and compare the binding capacities of different in vitro deglycosylated IgA1 on human mesangial cells. Serum IgA1 was purified by jacalin affinity chromatography and then was desialylated (DesIgA1) and/or degalactosylated (Des/DeGalIgA1) with neuraminidase and/or 1 galactosidase. The efficacy of deglycosylations was assessed by Peanut agglutinin (PNA) and Vicia villosa (VV) lectin. The sizes of normal IgA1 and deglycosylated IgA1 were determined by Sephacryl S-300 chromatography and binding capacities to primary HMC were evaluated by radioligand binding assays. Normal IgA1 and deglycosylated IgA1 could bind to HMC in a dose-dependent, saturable manner. The maximal. binding capacities and binding sites/cell of DesIgA1 and Des/DeGalIgA were significantly higher than that of normal IgA1. However, more aggregated IgA1 was found in DesIgA1 and Des/DeGalIgA1. Scatchard analysis revealed a similar K-d of normal IgA1 and deglycosylated IgA1. The current study suggested that the binding capacities of DesIgA1 and Des/DeGalIgA1 to HMC were significantly higher than that of normal IgA1, which at least in part was due to more macromolecular IgA1 in deglycoslated IgA1. However, there were no significant differences in the affinities of normal IgA1, DesIgA1 and Des/DeGalIgA1 with HMC. Deglycosylated IgA1 might play an important role in pathogenesis of IgAN.

Neurotransmitters such as serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and acetylcholine have been implicated. Abnormalities in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been identified including cortical loss of binding to the alpha4/beta2 subtype and increase in cerebellar alpha7 binding. Receptor expression (mRNA) has not so far been systematically examined. This study aims to further explore the role of nicotinic receptors in autism by analysing nicotinic receptor subunit mRNA in conjunction with protein levels and receptor binding in different brain areas. Quantitative RT-PCR for alpha4, alpha7 and beta2 subunit mRNA expression levels; alpha3, alpha4, alpha7 and beta2 subunit protein expression immunochemistry and specific radioligand receptor binding were performed in adult autism and control brain samples from cerebral cortex and cerebellum. Alpha4 and beta2 protein expression and receptor binding density as well as alpha4 mRNA levels were lower in parietal cortex in autism, while alpha8 did not change for any of these parameters. In cerebellum, alpha4 mRNA expression was increased, whereas subunit protein and receptor levels were decreased. Alpha7 receptor binding in cerebellum was increased alongside non-significant elevations in mRNA and protein expression levels. No significant changes were found for beta2 in cerebellum. The data obtained, using complementary measures of receptor expression, indicate that reduced gene expression of the alpha4beta2 nicotinic receptor in the cerebral cortex is a major feature of the neurochemical pathology of autism, whilst post-transcriptional abnormalities of both this and the alpha7 subtype are apparent in the cerebellum. The findings point to dendritic and/or synaptic nicotinic receptor abnormalities that may relate to disruptions in cerebral circuitry development. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Labelled in the 4-position with radioiodine, (R)-4-[I-13]fliodometomidate, 2, [I-131]IMTO has been evaluated by in-vitro studies and also ex-vivo in rats. [I-131]IMTO was synthesized by oxidative radioiododestannylation using a suitable precursor which was prepared by a new stereoselective synthesis. Optimization of the labelling reaction was performed by systematic variation of the most important reaction parameters. Under optimum reaction conditions, a labelling yield of 95% was obtained. In-vitro-stability of the tracer was studied over 8 days, indicating slow deiodination (0.27%/h). Displacement studies using [I-131]IMTO and rat adrenal membranes revealed the structural requirements for high affinity binding, namely an intact ester group and (R)-configuration of the radioligand. Pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed fast accumulation of [I-131]IMTO in the adrenals (approx. 10% ID/g tissue) with an activity plateau for 2 hours. Metabolic degradation was indicated by a steady increase of renal activity up to 4 hours post injection. Based on target to non-target ratios the highest contrast for imaging of the adrenals was observed between 30 and 60 min post injection of [I-131]IMTO. We conclude that SPECT using [I-123]IMTO will be a promising method for the characterization of adrenal incidentalomas.

In nonhuman primates, F-18-FE-PE2I showed faster kinetics and less production of radiometabolites that could potentially permeate the blood-brain barrier than did C-11-PE2I. The aims of this study were to examine the quantification of DAT using F-18-FE-PE2I and to assess the effect of radiometabolites of F-18-FE-PE2I on the quantification in healthy humans. Methods: A 90-min dynamic PET scan was obtained for 10 healthy men after intravenous injection of F-18-FE-PE2I. Kinetic compartment model analysis with a metabolite-corrected arterial input function was performed. The effect of radiometabolites on the quantification was evaluated by time-stability analyses. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) method with the cerebellum as a reference region was evaluated as a noninvasive method of quantification. Results: After the injection of F-18-FE-PE2I, the whole-brain radioactivity showed a high peak (similar to 3-5 standardized uptake value) and fast washout. The radioactive uptake of F-18-FE-PE2I in the brain was according to the relative density of the DAT (striatum > midbrain > thalamus). The cerebellum showed the lowest uptake. Tissue time-activity curves were well described by the 2-tissue-compartment model (TCM), as compared with the 1-TCM, for all subjects in all regions. Time stability analysis showed stable estimation of total distribution volume with 60-min or longer scan durations, indicating the small effect of radiometabolites. Binding potentials in the striatum and midbrain were well estimated by the SRTM method, with modest intersubject variability. Although the SRTM method yielded a slight underestimation and overestimation in regions with high and low DAT densities, respectively, binding potentials by the SRTM method were well correlated to the estimates by the indirect kinetic method with 2-TCM. Conclusion: F-18-FE-PE2I is a promising PET radioligand for quantifying DAT. The binding potentials could be reliably estimated in both the striatum and midbrain using both the indirect kinetic and SRTM methods with a scan duration of 60 min. Although radiometabolites of F-18-FE-PE2I in plasma possibly introduced some effects on the radioactivity in the brain, the effects on estimated binding potential were likely to be small.

Imaging and Quantitation of Cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> Receptors in Human and Monkey Brains Using <SUP>18</SUP>F-Labeled Inverse Agonist Radioligands	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						positron emission tomography; brain imaging neuroimaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TRANSPORTER; MODEL	We recently demonstrated that C-11-MePPEP, a PET ligand for CB1 receptors, has such high uptake in the human brain that it can be imaged for 210 min and that receptor density can be quantified as distribution volume (V-T) using the gold standard of compartmental modeling. However, C-11-MePPEP had relatively poor retest and intersubject variabilities, which were likely caused by errors in the measurements of radioligand in plasma at low concentrations by 120 min. We sought to find an analog of C-11-MePPEP that would provide more accurate plasma measurements. We evaluated several promising analogs in the monkey brain and chose the F-18-di-deutero fluoromethoxy analog (F-18-FMPEP-d(2)) to evaluate further in the human brain. Methods: C-11-FMePPEP, F-18-FEPEP, F-18-FMPEP, and F-18-FMPEP-d(2) were studied in 5 monkeys with 10 PET scans. We calculated VT using compartmental modeling with serial measurements of unchanged parent radioligand in arterial plasma and radioactivity in the brain. Nonspecific binding was determined by administering a receptor-saturating dose of rimonabant, an inverse agonist at the CB1 receptor. Nine healthy human subjects participated in 17 PET scans using F-18-FMPEP-d(2), with 8 subjects having 2 PET scans to assess retest variability. To identify sources of error, we compared intersubject and retest variability of brain uptake, arterial plasma measurements, and VT. Results: F-18-FMPEP-d(2) had high uptake in the monkey brain, with greater than 80% specific binding, and yielded less radioactivity uptake in bone than did F-18-FMPEP. High brain uptake with F-18-FMPEP-d(2) was also observed in humans, in whom VT was well identified within approximately 60 min. Retest variability of plasma measurements was good (16%); consequently, VT had a good retest variability (14%), intersubject variability (26%), and intraclass correlation coefficient (0.89). VT increased after 120 min, suggesting an accumulation of radiometabolites in the brain. Radioactivity accumulated in the skull throughout the entire scan but was thought to be an insignificant source of data contamination. Conclusion: Studies in monkeys facilitated our development and selection of F-18-FMPEP-d(2), compared with F-18-FMPEP, as a radioligand demonstrating high brain uptake, high percentage of specific binding, and reduced uptake in bone. Retest analysis in human subjects showed that F-18-FMPEP-d(2) has greater precision and accuracy than C-11-MePPEP, allowing smaller sample sizes to detect a significant difference between groups.

Disulfiram inhibits defluorination of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FCWAY, reduces bone radioactivity, and enhances visualization of radioligand binding to serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in human brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						metabolism; F-18-FCWAY; 5HT(1A) receptor; PET; disulfiram; defluorination; serotonin	P-GLYCOPROTEIN; CYTOCHROME-P450 2E1; DRUGS; BLOOD	F-18-trans-4-Fluoro-N-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (F-18-FCWAY) is a PET radioligand for imaging serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-1A receptors in brain. F-18-FCWAY undergoes significant defluorination, with high uptake of radioactivity in the skull and resulting spillover contamination in the underlying neocortex. The cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1 defluorinates many drugs. We previously showed that miconazole, an inhibitor of CYP2E1, blocks defluorination of FCWAY in rats. Here, we used F-18-FCWAY to test the ability of the less toxic agent disulfiram to inhibit defluorination in humans. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers underwent a PET scan before and after administration of 500 mg of disulfiram (n = 6) or 2,000 mg of cimetidine (n = 2). Seven of the subjects had arterial blood sampling during both scans. Results: Although cimetidine had relatively small and variable effects on 2 subjects, disulfiram reduced skull radioactivity by about 70% and increased peak brain uptake by about 50% (n = 5). Disulfiram decreased plasma-free F-18-fluoride ion (from peak levels of 340% +/- 62% standardized uptake value (SUV) to 62% +/- 43% SUV; P < 0.01) and increased the concentration of the parent F-18-FCWAY (with a corresponding decrease of clearance from 14.8 +/- 7.8 L.h(-1) at baseline to 7.9 +/- 2.8 L.h(-1) after drug treatment (P < 0.05). Using compartmental modeling with input of both F-18-FCWAY and the radiometabolite F-18-FC (trans-4-fluorocyclohexanecarboxylic acid), distribution volumes attributed to the parent radioligand unexpectedly decreased about 40%-60% after disulfiram, but the accuracy of the radiometabolite correction is uncertain. Disulfiram changed the shape of the brain time-activity curves in a manner that could occur with inhibition of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). However, disulfiram showed no in vivo efficacy in monkeys to enhance the uptake of the known P-gp substrate C-11-loperamide, suggesting that the effects of disulfiram in humans were mediated entirely by inhibition of CYP2E1. Conclusion: A single oral dose of disulfiram inhibited about 70% of the defluorination of F-18-FCWAY, increased the plasma concentration of F-18-FCWAY, increased brain uptake of activity, and resulted in better visualization of 5-HT1A receptor in the brain. Disulfiram is a safe and well-tolerated drug that may be useful for other radioligands that undergo defluorination via CYP2E1.

Effects of chronic exposure to haloperidol, olanzapine or lithium on SV2A and NLGN synaptic puncta in the rat frontal cortex	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Antipsychotics; Lithium; Synaptic density; SV2A; Schizophrenia; Bipolar disorder	ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HIPPOCAMPAL; SYNAPTOPHYSIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYNAPSES; DENSITY; EXPRESSION; PATHOLOGY; PROTEINS	Positron emission tomography studies using the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [11C]-UCBJ provide in vivo evidence for synaptic dysfunction and/or loss in the cingulate and frontal cortex of patients with schizophrenia. In exploring potential confounding effects of antipsychotic medication, we previously demonstrated that chronic (28-day) exposure to clinically relevant doses of haloperidol does not affect [3H]-UCB-J radioligand binding in the cingulate and frontal cortex of male rats. Furthermore, neither chronic haloperidol nor olanzapine exposure had any effect on SV2A protein levels in these brain regions. These data do not exclude the possibility, however, that more subtle changes in SV2A may occur at pre-synaptic terminals, or the post-synaptic density, following chronic antipsychotic drug exposure. Moreover, relatively little is known about the potential effects of psychotropic drugs other than antipsychotics on SV2A. To address these questions directly, we herein used immunostaining and confocal microscopy to explore the effect of chronic (28-day) exposure to clinically relevant doses of haloperidol, olanzapine or the mood stabilizer lithium on presynaptic SV2A, postsynaptic Neuroligin (NLGN) puncta and their overlap as a measure of total synaptic density in the rat prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. We found that, under the conditions tested here, exposure to antipsychotics had no effect on SV2A, NLGN, or overall synaptic puncta count. In contrast, chronic lithium exposure significantly increased NLGN puncta density relative to vehicle, with no effect on either SV2A or total synaptic puncta. Future studies are required to understand the functional consequences of these changes.

In certain cases, low A(m) can skew the estimation of specific binding. The high proportion of the non-radioactive component can reduce the apparent-specific binding by competitively binding to receptors. We developed a nucleophilic synthesis of [F-18]F-DPA resulting in high A(m) (990 +/- 150 GBq/mu mol) and performed in vivo comparison with low A(m) (9.0 +/- 2.9 GBq/mu mol) [F-18]F-DPA in the same APP/PS1-21 and wild-type mice (injected masses: 0.34 +/- 0.13 mu g/kg and 38 +/- 15 mu g/kg, respectively). The high level of microgliosis in the APP/PS1-21 mouse model enables good differentiation between diseased and healthy animals and serves better to distinguish the effect of differing A(m) on specific binding. The differing injected masses affect the washout profile and shape of the time-activity curves. Ratios of standardized uptake values obtained with high and low A(m) [F-18]F-DPA demonstrate that there is a 1.5-fold higher uptake of radioactivity in the brains of APP/PS1-21 animals when imaging is carried out with high A(m) [F-18]F-DPA. The differences between APP/PS1-21 and wild-type animals showed higher significance when high A(m) was used.

This prompted the hypothesis of psychosis as a state of "endogenous" sensitization of the dopamine system although the exact basis of dopaminergic disturbances and the possible role of prefrontal cortical regulation have remained uncertain. To show that patients with first-episode psychosis release more dopamine upon amphetamine-stimulation than healthy volunteers, and to reveal for the first time that prospective sensitization induced by repeated amphetamine exposure increases dopamine-release in stimulant-naive healthy volunteers to levels observed in patients, we collected data on amphetamine-induced dopamine release using the dopamine D-2/3 receptor agonist radioligand [C-11]-(+)-PHNO and positron emission tomography. Healthy volunteers (n = 28, 14 female) underwent a baseline and then a post-amphetamine scan before and after a mildly sensitizing regimen of repeated oral amphetamine. Unmedicated patients with first-episode psychosis (n = 21; 6 female) underwent a single pair of baseline and then post-amphetamine scans. Furthermore, T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging of the prefrontal cortex was performed. Patients with first-episode psychosis showed larger release of dopamine compared to healthy volunteers. After sensitization of healthy volunteers their dopamine release was significantly amplified and no longer different from that seen in patients. Healthy volunteers showed a negative correlation between prefrontal cortical volume and dopamine release. There was no such relationship after sensitization or in patients. Our data in patients with untreated first-episode psychosis confirm the "endogenous sensitization" hypothesis and support the notion of impaired prefrontal control of the dopamine system in schizophrenia.

Methods: Dynamic PET/CT of [F-18]FE-PE2I was performed in Parkinson's disease (PD) rat models, induced by the unilateral injection of 6-OHDA into the striatum. A simplified reference tissue model method was used to calculate the striatal binding potential (striatal BPND). Each of the four normal rats was pretreated with pramipexole, amantadine, and escitalopram 30 min before [F-18]FE-PE2I injection. The effect of L-DOPA combined with benserazide was assessed in the normal and PD rats. Results: The BPND was significantly lower in the lesioned striatum than in the striatum of the normal rats. After the pretreatment with pramipexole, amantadine, and escitalopram, the values of the striatal BPND did not differ from those of the controls. The pretreatment with L-DOPA/benserazide, however, significantly reduced the striatal BPND. The striatal BPND of the PD rats with L-DOPA/benserazide pretreatment was not different from that of the same PD rats with placebo treatment Conclusion: [F-18]FE-PE2I may be used as a radioligand for the in-vivo imaging of the DAT. In the normal rats, [F-18] FE-PE2I binding is unaffected by pramipexole, amantadine, and escitalopram. L-DOPA/benserazide does not affect the striatal [F-18]FE-PE2I binding in PD rats (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Performing in vivo imaging of these receptors in humans holds great promise for understanding their role in these conditions. Recently, three radiohalogenated analogs of 3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (A-85380) were used successfully for the in vivo visualization of alpha4beta2* nicotinic receptors in the human brain with PET/SPECT. Herein, we present the results of the in vitro characterization of one of these radioligands, 6-[F-18]fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)-pyridine (6-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380), which is a fluoro-analog of the potent nonopioid analgesic ABT-594. In human postmortem cortical tissue, 6- [F-18]fluoro-A-85380 reversibly binds with high affinity to a single population of sites (K-d = 59 pM at 37degreesC, B-max = 0.7 pmol/g tissue). The binding is fully reversible and is characterized at 37degreesC by T-1/2assoc = 2.2 min (at a ligand concentration of 39 pM) and by T-1/2dissoc = 3.6 min. 6-Fluoro-A-85380 exhibits clear selectivity for alpha4beta2* over the other major mammalian nicotinic receptor subtypes: alpha7, alpha3beta4, and muscle-type. These results suggest that 6-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 is a promising radioligand for in vivo imaging of brain alpha4beta2* nicotinic receptors. Published 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Human biodistribution and dosimetry of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]nifene, an α4β2*nicotinic acetylcholine receptor PET tracer	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine; Positron emission tomography; Dosimetry	NONHUMAN PRIMATE; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; IN-VIVO; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; F-18-NIFENE; KINETICS	Introduction: The alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) system is implicated in many neuropsychiatric pathologies. [F-18]Nifene is a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand that has shown promise for in vivo imaging of the alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR system in preclinical models and humans. This work establishes the radiation burden associated with [F-18]nifene PET scans in humans. Methods: Four human subjects (2M, 2F) underwent whole-body PET/CT scans to determine the human biodistribution of [F-18]nifene. Source organs were identified and time-activity-curves (TACs) were extracted from the PET time-series. Dose estimates were calculated for each subject using OLINDA/EXM v1.1. Results: [F-18]Nifene was well tolerated by all subjects with no adverse events reported. The mean whole-body effective dose was 28.4 +/- 3.8 mSv/MBq without bladder voiding, and 22.6 +/- 1.9 mSv/MBq with hourly micturition. The urinary bladder radiation dose limited the maximum injected dose for a single scan to 278 MBq without urinary bladder voiding, and 519 MBq with hourly voiding. Conclusions: [F-18]Nifene is a safe PET radioligand for imaging the alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR system in humans.

A new class of endomorphin-1 (EM-1) analogues was synthesized by combining successful chemical modifications including N-terminal guanidino modification, Phe(4) was chlorinated, replaced of t-Pro(2)-Trp(3) by D-Ala(2)-Gly(3) or D-Pro(2)-Gly(3) at position 2 and 3. Their bioactivities were measured by radioligand binding assay, metabolic stability, antinociception activity and sperm motility effects. In radioligand binding assays, analogue GAGP shown a mu-opioid receptor affinity about 17.7-fold higher and a 573-fold higher delta-opioid receptor affinity than EM-1. In the metabolic stability assays, GAGP had the longest half-lives and 16.6-fold higher than EM-1. In the tail-flick test in mice, GAGP showed the best analgesia. In sperm motility assays, the group of GAGP (10(-5), 10(-7) mol/L) decreased of the percentage of a + b grade, and no significant when compared with initial value. In GAGP (10(-6) mol/L) group, sperm motility was progressively increased, although it was not statistically significant. But at the groups of morphine (10(-7) mol/L) and GAGD (10(-7) mol/L), these caused significant reduction between 0 and 90 min. We found that analogues GAGP, activating mu-opioid receptor and partial delta-opioid receptor, exhibit good analgesic effects with minimal implications for human sperm motility. It might be important in potential application as drug candidates of analgesic without implications for human sperm motility. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using radioligand-binding and functional assays of inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation and Ca21 mobilization in a recombinant cell line stably expressing the human M-5 mAChR, we investigated the effects of the positive allosteric modulator (PAM), ML380, and negative allosteric modulator, ML375. In functional assays, ML380 caused robust enhancements in the potency of the full agonists, acetylcholine (ACh), carbachol, and oxotremorine-M, while significantly increasing the maximal response to the partial agonist, pilocarpine. ML380 also demonstrated direct allosteric agonist activity. In contrast, ML375 displayed negative cooperativity with each of the agonists in a manner that varied with the pathway investigated and progressively reduced the maximal pilocarpine response. Radioligand-binding affinity cooperativity estimates were consistent with values derived from functional assays in some instances but not others, suggesting additional allosteric effects on orthosteric ligand efficacy. For ML375 this was confirmed in IP assays performed after reduction of receptor reserve by the alkylating agent, phenoxybenzamine, as it reduced the maximal ACh response. In contrast, ML380 enhanced only ACh potency after receptor alkylation, with no effect on maximal response, consistent with studies of the M-1 mAChR with the prototypical PAM, BQZ12. Interaction studies between ML380 and ML375 also indicated that they most likely used an overlapping allosteric site. Our findings indicate that novel small-molecule modulators of the M-5 mAChR display mixed mechanisms of action compared with previously characterized modulators of other mAChRs.

This may be used to quantify the high-affinity state of 5-HT2A receptors and may have the potential to quantify changes in cerebral 5-HT levels in vivo. We here investigated safety aspects related to clinical use of [C-11]Cimbi-36, including radiation dosimetry and in vivo pharmacology. [C-11]Cimbi-36 was injected in rats or pigs, and radiation dosimetry was examined by ex vivo dissection or with PET scanning, respectively. Based on animal data, the Organ Level INternal Dose Assessment software was used to estimate extrapolated human dosimetry for [C-11]Cimbi-36. The 5-HT2A receptor agonist actions of [C-11]Cimbi-36 in vivo pharmacological effects in mice elicited by increasing doses of Cimbi-36 were assessed with the head-twitch response (HTR). The effective dose as extrapolated from both rat and pig data was low, 7.67 and 4.88 mu Sv/MBq, respectively. In addition, the estimated absorbed radiation dose to human target organs did not exceed safety levels. Administration of 0.5 mg/kg Cimbi-36 leads to significant HTR compared to saline, whereas 0.05 mg/kg Cimbi-36 (doses much larger than those given in conjunction with a PET scan) did not elicit a significant HTR. Administration of tracer doses of [C-11]Cimbi-36 does not seem to be associated with unusual radiation burden or adverse clinical effects.

Muscarinic receptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB), but their site(s) of action and actual therapeutic target are unclear. Our aim was to compare, in human bladder mucosa and detrusor, the radioligand binding characteristics of newer, clinically effective agents: darifenacin, its hydroxylated metabolite UK-148,993, fesoterodine, solifenacin, tolterodine, and trospium. Specimens were collected from asymptomatic patients (50-72 years old) undergoing open bladder surgery. Radioligand binding studies with the muscarinic antagonist [H-3] quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were performed separately on detrusor and mucosal membranes. All antagonists displayed high affinity when competing for [H-3] QNB binding in both detrusor and mucosa. Inhibition constants were also obtained for all antagonists against individual muscarinic receptor subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Here, fesoterodine showed anomalous binding results, suggesting that some conversion to its metabolite had occurred. Global nonlinear regression analysis of bladder binding data with five antagonists demonstrated 82% low-affinity sites in mucosa and 78% low-affinity sites in detrusor, probably representing M-2/M-4 receptors. There was an excellent correlation (r(2) = 0.99) of low-affinity global estimates between detrusor and mucosa, whereas the corresponding high-affinity estimates (similar to 20% of sites) were dissimilar. In conclusion, commonly used and clinically effective muscarinic receptor antagonists bind to receptors located on the bladder mucosa and the detrusor, providing support for the hypothesis that muscarinic receptors in the mucosa may represent an important site of action for these agents in OAB.

We have characterized the impact of four naturally occurring variants in the HTR3B gene leading to amino acid exchanges within the respective subunit of heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors on a functional and expressional level. Methods and results For functional characterization, a Ca2+ influx assay based on aequorin bioluminescence was used. Radioligand-binding studies with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [H-3]GR65630 were carried out to determine expression levels of heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors. Transiently transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells using 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B complementary DNA constructs were shown to coexpress homopentameric 5-HT3A next to heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors. The variant p.V1831 decreased surface expression, whereas p.Y129S and p.S156R led to pronounced increases of 5-HT maximum responses, despite nearly unaltered surface expression levels of heteromeric 5-HT3A/B receptors. Conclusion These results may help to explain earlier reported association findings of the frequent p.Y129S and p.V1831 variants with psychiatric diseases. Replication studies with larger sample pools, especially regarding the rare p.S156R variant would be useful, to obtain an idea about the predisposing role of these single nucleotide polymorphisms as susceptibility variants.

Restrictions on the world-wide distribution of [H-3]-STX imposed by the international Chemical Weapons Convention served as the primary impetus for this study. We have incorporated on a preparative scale, a nonexchangeable tritium label into the TTX molecule at a specific activity of 12.90 Ci/mmol and recovered material of high radiochemical purity (98%). The resulting 11-[H-3]TTX was found to exhibit site-specific binding characteristics in the receptor assay (dissociation constant (K-d) = 4.77 +/- 1.54 nM; maximum binding (B-max) = 1.62 +/- 0.24 pmol/mg of synaptosomal protein). The inhibition constant (K-i) for the assay was 1.46 +/- 0.28 nM STX equiv. (n = 6), with an estimated detection limit of ca. 2-4 ng STX equiv./ml in a sample extract. Moreover, quantitative comparisons indicated that 11-[H-3]-TTX could be used interchangeably with [H-3]-STX in the receptor assay for determination of PSP toxicity in shellfish and algal extracts without compromising assay performance. We conclude that the 11-[H-3]-TTX produced and evaluated herein exhibits physical, chemical and biological characteristics suitable not only for use in the PSP receptor binding assay, but likely for other applications employing [H-3]-STX as the radioligand.

The severe dose-limiting side effects of chemotherapy necessitate the development of novel, efficient and tolerable therapy approaches. In this regard, the prostate specific membrane antigene (PSMA) has been well established as a molecular target for diagnosis of, as well as therapy for, prostate cancer. Although most PSMA-targeting ligands are radiopharmaceuticals used in imaging or radioligand therapy, this article evaluates a PSMA-targeting small molecule-drug conjugate, and, thus, addresses a hitherto little-explored field. PSMA binding affinity and cytotoxicity were determined in vitro using cell-based assays. Enzyme-specific cleavage of the active drug was quantified via an enzyme-based assay. Efficacy and tolerability in vivo were assessed using an LNCaP xenograft model. Histopathological characterization of the tumor in terms of apoptotic status and proliferation rate was carried out using caspase-3 and Ki67 staining. The binding affinity of the Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) conjugate was moderate, compared to the drug-free PSMA ligand. Cytotoxicity in vitro was in the nanomolar range. Both binding and cytotoxicity were found to be PSMA-specific. Additionally, complete MMAE release could be reached after incubation with cathepsin B. In vivo, the MMAE conjugate displayed good tolerability and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth. Immunohistochemical and histological studies revealed the antitumor effect of MMAE.VC.SA.617, resulting in the inhibition of proliferation and the enhancement of apoptosis. The developed MMAE conjugate showed good properties in vitro, as well as in vivo, and should, therefore, be considered a promising candidate for a translational approach.

Material and Methods Nominal group and Delphi techniques were used. A steering committee of 8 experts reviewed the current management of NETs, identified controversies and gaps, critically analyzed the available evidence, and formulated several guiding statements for clinicians. Subsequently, a panel of 26 experts, was selected to test agreement with the statements through 2 Delphi rounds. Items were scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 = totally agree to 4 = totally disagree. The agreement was considered if >= 75% of answers pertained to Categories 1 and 2 (consensus with the agreement) or Categories 3 and 4 (consensus with the disagreement). Results Overall, 132 statements were proposed, which incorporated the following areas: (1) overarching principles; (2) progression and treatment response criteria; (3) advanced gastro-enteric NETs; (4) advanced pancreatic NETs; (5) advanced NETs in other locations; (6) re-treatment with radioligand therapy (RLT); (7) neoadjuvant therapy. After 2 Delphi rounds, only 4 statements lacked a clear consensus. RLT was not only recommended in the sequencing of different NETs but also as neoadjuvant treatment, while several indications for retreatment with RLT were also established. Conclusion This document sought to pull together the experts' attitudes when dealing with different clinical scenarios of patients suffering from NETs, with RLT having a specific role where evidence-based data are limited.

These patients also receive frequent PSMA PET/CT scans for staging and follow up. PSMA is not only overexpressed in prostate cancer epithelial cells, but also physiologically overexpressed in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney. This study investigates the utility of PSMA-targeted imaging for determination of relative renal function. mCRPC patients (n = 97) having received Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT and Tc-99m-MAG3 scintigraphy in close temporal relationship were included in this retrospective study. PSMA-PET-derived SRF was calculated according to the bilateral renal PSMA content (total kidney PSMA = SUVmean x volume), MAG3-based SRF (SRFMAG3) using the common standard integral method of the renal secretion phase. The agreement of SRFPSMA and SRFMAG3 was statistically tested using Pearson correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. The correlation between both SRF assessment methods was highly significant (P < 0.001) with r=0.91. Bland-Altman analysis confirmed agreement of the measurements. High correlation and agreement were also observed in the subgroup analyses of patients with normal and reduced renal function (r=0.81, P < 0.001 and r=0.98, P < 0.001). Renal tubular PSMA expression allows assessment of split renal function by Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT imaging. Additional MAG3 scintigraphy for the purpose of quantifying relative renal function contribution may be spared in settings where PSMA PET is performed; this insight could save time and unnecessary examinations.

The commonly used in clinical practice anxiolytics are focused on pharmacological modulation of brain GABA receptor system activity. As a rule, their use presents a wide spectrum of clinical issues such as dependence, memory impairment and etc. There is an increasing appreciation of the role of neuropeptides and bioactive lipids in the pathophysiology of mood and anxiety disorders as "mild" agents. Heptapeptide Selank (Thr-Lys-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro) exhibits prolonged anti-anxiety and nootropic effects. Objective: In this issue, we tried to find the molecular mechanisms which may underlie Selank anti-anxiety effects. Methods: The main method we used was the radioligand- receptor method of analysis. We also used HPLC (to obtain and ensure reagents and Selank purity) and the methods of brain cells plasmatic membranes isolation and following detection of protein concentration in membrane samples. Results: It was shown that Selank affect the [H-3]GABA binding as a positive allosteric modulator. The joint action of Selank and some of benzodiazepines also regulates activity of [H-3]GABA binding in specific manner, which is not cumulative and differs from either substance individually. Selank is able to block the modulatory activity of Diazepam and Olanzapine, the location of their and peptide binding sites apparently not the same, but potentially may partially overlaps. Conclusion: Thus, we hypothesized and showed that one of Selank anti-anxiety molecular mechanisms can be associated with subtype selective concentration - dependent allosteric modulation of GABA receptors.

Estimation of drug receptor occupancy when non-displaceable binding differs between brain regions - extending the simplified reference tissue model	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						caudate; non-linear mixed effects; PET; receptor occupancy; SRTM; white matter	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBELLUM; KINETICS	AimThe simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) is used for estimation of receptor occupancy assuming that the non-displaceable binding in the reference region is identical to the brain regions of interest. The aim of this work was to extend the SRTM to also account for inter-regional differences in non-displaceable concentrations, and to investigate if this model allowed estimation of receptor occupancy using white matter as reference. It was also investigated if an apparent higher affinity in caudate compared with other brain regions, could be better explained by a difference in the extent of non-displaceable binding. MethodsThe analysis was based on a PET study in six healthy volunteers using the 5-HT1B receptor radioligand [C-11]-AZ10419369. The radioligand was given intravenously as a tracer dose alone and following different oral doses of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist AZD3783. Non-linear mixed effects models were developed where differences between regions in non-specific concentrations were accounted for. The properties of the models were also evaluated by means of simulation studies. ResultsThe estimate (95% CI) of Ki(PL) was 10.2ngml(-1) (5.4, 15) and 10.4ngml(-1) (8.1, 13.6) based on the extended SRTM with white matter as reference and based on the SRTM using cerebellum as reference, respectively. The estimate (95% CI) of Ki(PL) for caudate relative to other brain regions was 55% (48, 62%). ConclusionsThe extended SRTM allows consideration of white matter as reference region when no suitable grey matter region exists. AZD3783 affinity appears to be higher in the caudate compared with other brain regions.

Here we investigate whether agonists and antagonists can be thermodynamically discriminated at CCK2 receptors in rat cerebral cortex. Experimental approach: The pK(L) of [H-3]-JB93182 in rat cerebral cortex membranes was determined at 4, 12, 21 and 37 degrees C in 50 mM Tris-HCI buffer (buffer B pH 6.96; containing 0.089 mM bacitracin). pK(I) values of ligands of diverse chemical structure and with differing intrinsic activity (a), as defined by the lumen-perfused rat and mouse stomach bioassays, were determined in buffer B at 4, 12, 21 and 37 degrees C. Key results: [H-3]-JB93182 labelled a homogeneous population of receptors in rat cerebral cortex at 4, 12, 21 and 37 degrees C and the pKL and B-max were not altered by incubation temperature. [H-3]-JB93182 binding reached equilibrium after 10, 50, 90 and 220 min at 37, 21, 12 and 4 degrees C, respectively. pKI values for R-L-365,260, R-L-740,093, YM220, PD134,308 and JB95008 were higher at 4 degrees C than at 37 degrees C. There was no effect of temperature on pKI values for pentagastrin, CCK-8S, S-L-365,260, YM022, PD140,376 and JB93242. Conclusions and implications: CCK2 receptor agonists and antagonists at rat CCK2 receptors cannot be discriminated by thermodynamic analysis using [H-3]-JB93182 as the radioligand.

The current study was to investigate the binding characteristics of monomeric and polymeric normal human IgA1 on mesangial cells and the influence of in vitro deglycosylation of IgA1 molecules. The normal human IgA1 was desialylated and degalactosylated with specific enzymes, respectively. The monomeric IgA1 (mIgA1) and polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1) were separated by Sephacryl S-300 chromatography. The binding capacities of the mIgA1 and pIgA1 to primary human mesangial cells (HMC) were evaluated by classical radioligand assay. Both the native mIgA1 and pIgA1 could bind to HMC in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. The maximal binding capacity of the native pIgA1 were significantly higher than that of the native mIgA1 (P < 0.05). However, the affinity of the native mIgA1 was almost 100 times higher than that of the native pIgA1. After deglycosylation, binding of the two deglycosylated mIgA1 to HMC could not be detected. However, the maximal binding capacities of the two deglycosylated pIgA1 to HMC were increased significantly compared with that of native pIgA1. The affinity of the two deglycosylated pIgA1 was similar to that of native pIgA1 (P > 0.05). The current study suggests differential binding characteristics of native monomeric and polymeric IgA1 on mesangial cells. Glycosylation of IgA1 molecules could significantly affect the binding of IgA1 on HMC.

This yielded 13 alternative energetically favorable models. The models fell into 3 groups. In model type A the aromatic rings of granisetron were between Trp-90 and Phe-226 and its azabicyclic ring was between Trp-183 and Tyr-234, in model type B this orientation was reversed, and in model type C the aromatic rings were between Asp-229 and Ser-200 and the azabicyclic ring was between Phe-226 and Asn-128. Residues located no more than 5 angstrom from the docked granisetron were identified for each model; of 26 residues identified, 8 were found to be common to all models, with 18 others being represented in only a subset of the models. To identify which of the docking models best represents the ligand-receptor complex, we substituted each of these 26 residues with alanine and a residue with similar chemical properties. The mutant receptors were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells and the affinity of granisetron determined using radioligand binding. Mutation of 2 residues (Trp-183 and Glu-129) ablated binding, whereas mutation of 14 other residues caused changes in the [H-3] granisetron binding affinity in one or both mutant receptors. The data showed that residues both in and close to the binding pocket can affect antagonist binding and overall were found to best support model B.

In the rat and human brain, 5-HT6 receptors are widely expressed and highly enriched in the basal ganglia. However, in the mouse brain, only very low levels of 5-HT6 receptor mRNA and receptor protein, measured by TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and selective radioligand binding, could be detected, with no evidence of enrichment in the basal ganglia. The mouse receptor was cloned and transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells to characterize its pharmacological profile. Despite significant sequence homology between human, rat, and mouse 5-HT6 receptors, the pharmacological profile of the mouse receptor was significantly different from the rat and human receptors. Four amino acid residues, conserved in rat and human and divergent in mouse receptors, were identified, and various mutant receptors were generated and their pharmacologies studied. Residues 188 (tyrosine in mouse, phenylalanine in rat and human) in transmembrane region 5 and 290 (serine in mouse, asparagine in rat and human) in transmembrane region 6 were identified as key amino acids responsible for the different pharmacological profiles. Molecular modeling of the receptor and docking of selective and nonselective compounds was undertaken to elucidate the ligand receptor interactions. The binding pocket was predicted to be different in the mouse compared with rat and human 5-HT6 receptors, and the models were in excellent agreement with the observed mutation results and have been used extensively in the design of further selective 5-HT6 antagonists.

In both tissues, [I-125]EYF binding was saturable and revealed a very high affinity interaction with a single class of binding sites in rat and mouse (K-D = 0.041 and 0.019 nM. respectively). Competition studies showed that [I-125]EYF bound to one class of binding sites exhibiting a high affinity for all the different peptides the precursor could generate (NPA-NPFF, SPA-NPFF, NPFF, EFW-NPSF, QFW-NPSF) with the exception of NPSF which displayed a low affinity. Autoradiographic studies demonstrated that [I-125]EYF binding sites were fully inhibited by a synthetic Neuropeptide FF agonist(1DMe) in all areas of the rat brain. The density of [I-125]EYF binding sites wax high in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the parafascicular thalamic nucleus and in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn. Non specific binding reached 5-10% of the total binding in all brain areas. Similarly, in mouse brain experiments, the non-specific binding was never superior to 10%. These findings demonstrate that putative neuropeptides generated by the Neuropeptide FF precursor and containing the NPFF or NPSF sequences should bind to the same receptor. Furthermore, these data indicate that [I-125]EYF is a useful radiolabeled probe to investigate the NPFF receptors; its major advantages being its high affinity and the very low non-specific binding it induces.

The uptake of radioactivity in skull compromises the accuracy of measurements of 5-HT1A receptor densities in adjacent areas of brain because of spillover of radioactivity through the partial-volume effect. Our aim was to demonstrate with a rat model that defluoirination of F-18-FCWAY may be inhibited in vivo to improve its applicability to measuring brain regional 5-HT1A receptor densities. Methods: PET of rat head after administration of F-18-FCWAY was used to confirm that the distribution of radioactivity measured in brain is dominated by binding to 5-HT1A receptors and to reveal the extent of defluorination of F-18-FCWAY in vivo as represented by radioactivity (F-18-fluoride ion) uptake in skull. Cimetidine, diclofenac, and miconazole, known inhibitors of CYP450 2EI, were tested for the ability to inhibit defluorination of F-18-FCWAY in rat liver microsomes in vitro. The effects of miconazole treatment of rats on skull radioactivity uptake and, in turn, its spillover on brain 5-HT1A receptor imaging were assessed by PET with venous blood analysis. Results: PET confirmed the potential of F-18-FCWAY to act as a radioligand for 5-HT1A receptors in rat brain and also revealed extensive defluorination. In rat liver microsomes in vitro, defluorination of F-18-FCWAY was almost completely inhibited by miconazole and, to a less extent, by diclofenac. In PET experiments, treatment of rats with miconazole nitrate (60 mg/kg intravenously) over the 45-min period before administration of F-18-FCWAY almost obliterated defluorination and bone uptake of radioactivity. Also, brain radioactivity almost doubled while the ratio of radioactivity in receptor-rich ventral hippocampus to that in receptor-poor cerebellum almost tripled to 14. The plasma half-life of radioligand was also extended by miconazole treatment. Conclusion: Miconazole treatment, by eliminating defluorination of F-18-FCWAY, results in effective imaging of brain 5-HT1A receptors in rat. F-18-FCWAY PET in miconazole-treated rats can serve as an effective platform for investigating 5-HT1A receptors in rodent models of neuropsychiatric conditions or drug action.

The cognitive-enhancing effects of H-3 receptor antagonists across multiple cognitive domains in a wide number of preclinical cognition models also endow confidence in this therapeutic strategy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and the cognitive deficits often expressed in schizophrenia. Recent positive clinical reports are beginning to reinforce this optimism.

Oxytocin receptor binding sites in the periphery of the neonatal mouse	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VOLES MICROTUS-OCHROGASTER; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; DEFICIENT MICE; FETAL-BRAIN; DELIVERY; RAT; VASOPRESSIN; RECOGNITION; PARTURITION; INTRANASAL	Oxytocin (OXT) is a pleiotropic regulator of physiology and behavior. An emerging body of evidence demonstrates a role for OXT in the transition to postnatal life of the infant. To identify potential sites of OXT action via the OXT receptor (OXTR) in the newborn mouse, we performed receptor autoradiography on 20 m sagittal sections of whole postnatal day 0 male and female mice on a C57BL/6J background using the 125 iodinated ornithine vasotocin analog ([I-125]-OVTA) radioligand. A competitive binding assay on both wild-type (WT) and OXTR knockout (OXTR KO) tissue was used to assess the selectivity of [I-125]-OVTA for neonatal OXTR. Radioactive ligand (0.05 nM [I-125]-OVTA) was competed against concentrations of 0 nM, 10 nM, and 1000 nM excess unlabeled OXT. Autoradiographs demonstrated the high selectivity of the radioligand for infant peripheral OXTR. Specific ligand binding activity for OXTR was observed in the oronasal cavity, the eye, whisker pads, adrenal gland, and anogenital region in the neonatal OXTR WT mouse, but was absent in neonatal OXTR KO. Nonspecific binding was observed in areas with a high lipid content such as the scapular brown adipose tissue and the liver: in these regions, binding was present in both OXTR WT and KO mice, and could not be competed away with OXT in either WT or KO mice. Collectively, these data confirm novel OXT targets in the periphery of the neonate. These peripheral OXTR sites, coupled with the immaturity of the neonate's own OXT system, suggest a role for exogenous OXT in modulating peripheral physiology and development.

To support clinical studies in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, a detailed examination of the metabolism in vitro and in vivo has been performed. (+)- and (-)-flubatine, respectively, were incubated with liver microsomes from mouse and human in the presence of NADPH (-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt). Phase I in vitro metabolites were detected and their structures elucidated by LC-MS/MS (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry). Selected metabolite candidates were synthesized and investigated for structural confirmation. Besides a high level of in vitro stability, the microsomal incubations revealed some species differences as well as enantiomer discrimination with regard to the formation of monohydroxylated products, which was identified as the main metabolic pathway in this assay. Furthermore, after injection of 250 MBq (+)-[F-18]flubatine (specific activity > 350 GBq/mol) into mouse, samples were prepared from brain, liver, plasma, and urine after 30 min and investigated by radio-HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography with radioactivity detection). For structure elucidation of the radiometabolites of (+)-[F-18]flubatine formed in vivo, identical chromatographic conditions were applied to LC-MS/MS and radio-HPLC to compare samples obtained in vitro and in vivo. By this correlation approach, we assigned three of four main in vivo radiometabolites to products that are exclusively C- or N-hydroxylated at the azabicyclic ring system of the parent molecule.

Neuroinflammation in healthy aging: A PET study using a novel Translocator Protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radioligand, [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-FEPPA	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; PET imaging; Microglia activation; TSPO; Healthy aging; [F-18]-FEPPA	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; IN-VIVO; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; HUMAN BRAIN; BINDING-SITES; WHITE-MATTER; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS	One of the cellular markers of neuroinflammation is increased microglia activation, characterized by overexpression of mitochondrial 18 kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO). TSPO expression can be quantified in-vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [F-18]-FEPPA. This study examined microglial activation as measured with [F-18]-FEPPA PET across the adult lifespan in a group of healthy volunteers. We performed genotyping for the rs6971 TS.PO gene polymorphism to control for the known variability in binding affinity. Thirty-three healthy volunteers (age range: 19-82 years; 22 high affinity binders (HAB), 11 mixed affinity binders (MAB)) underwent [F-18]-FEPPA PET scans, acquired on the High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT) and analyzed using a 2-tissue compartment model. Regression analyses were performed to examine the effect of age adjusting for genetic status on [F-18]-FEPPA total distribution volumes (V-T) in the hippocampus, temporal, and prefrontal cortex. We found no significant effect of age on [F-18]-FEPPA V-T (F (1,30) = 0.918; p = 0.346), and a significant effect of genetic polymorphism (F (1,30) = 8.767; p = 0.006). This is the first in-vivo study to evaluate age-related changes in TSPO binding, using the new generation TSPO radioligands. Increased neuroinflammation, as measured with [F-18]-FEPPA PET was not associated with normal aging, suggesting that healthy elderly individuals may serve as useful benchmark against patients with neurodegenerative disorders where neuroinflammation may be present.

In the present study, we developed a novel radioligand, [H-3]3-chloro-N-((S)-((R)-1-methylpiperidin-2-yl)(thiophen- 3-yl)methyl)-4- (trifluoromethyl) picolinamide ([H-3]CHIBA-3007), for studying GlyT-1 in the brain. The presence of a single saturable high-affinity binding component for [H-3]CHIBA-3007 binding to the rat brain membranes was detected. Scatchard analysis revealed an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) of 1.61 +/- 0.16 nM and a maximal number of binding sites (B-max) of 692.8 +/- 22.8 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- SEM, n = 3). The specific binding of [H-3]CHIBA-3007 was inhibited by a number of GlyT-1 inhibitors, such as CHIBA-3007, desmethyl-CHIBA-3007, CHIBA-3008, SSR504734, NFPS/ALX5407, LY2365109 and Org24598, consistent with the pharmacological profiles of GlyT-1 inhibitors. Interestingly, the potency of eight GlyT-1 inhibitors (CHIBA-3007, desmethyl-CHIBA-3007, NFPS/ALX5407, LY2365109, Org24598, SSR504734, sarcosine, and glycine) for blocking in vitro specific binding of [H-3]CHIBA-3007 was significantly correlated with the potency of these inhibitors for inhibiting [C-14]glycine uptake in the rat brain membranes. In contrast, the GlyT-2 inhibitor ALX1393 exhibited very weak for [H-3]CHIBA-3007 binding. Furthermore, the regional distribution of [H-3]CHIBA-3007 binding in the rat brain was similar to the previously reported distribution of GlyT-1. The present findings suggest that [H-3]CHIBA-3007 would be a useful new radioligand for studying GlyT-1 in the brain.

The ET system was investigated in the vasa deferentia of 3 weeks, 3 months and 22 months old rats. ET receptors were characterized and quantified at the protein level by radioligand receptor binding, and gene transcript levels of ET-1, ET-3, ET converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1), and ETA and ETB receptor subtypes were quantified by real-time, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results of radioligand receptor binding assays demonstrate that there is a higher density of total ET receptors in the vas deferens of 3 weeks old rats than in 3 months and 22 months old rats, and that the predominant ET receptor is of the ETA subtype in all three ages. Real-time RT-PCR data show that the predominant mRNA expression of ETs and their receptors in all age groups studied are ET-1 and the ETA receptor subtype, respectively. Furthermore, ET-1, ET-3, ECE-1, and ETA and ETB receptor subtype mRNAs are expressed at higher levels in the 3 weeks old rats as compared with the other two age groups. These results demonstrate the presence of age-related changes in the properties of the ET receptor system at both protein and mRNA levels in the rat vas deferens.

After optimization of the transfection procedure, the binding of [H-3]propionyl-NPY to transiently and stably expressed Y-5 receptors was determined. The affinities of NPY, NPY derivatives, and rPP (pNPY greater than or equal to p(Leu(31)Pro(34))NPY = p(2-36)NPY greater than or equal to p(D-Trp(32))NPY > p(13-36)NPY > rPP) were in accordance with the NPY Y-5 receptor subtype. For [H-3]propionyl-pNPY approximately 1.7 + 10(5) and 1 + 10(6) binding sites per transiently and stably transfected cell, respectively, were determined. The K-D values were 2.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.7 +/- 0.2 nM, respectively. Due to the high expression of the receptor protein, both stably and transiently transfected cells can be conveniently used in routine radioligand binding studies. By contrast, functional assays were only feasible with HEC-1B cells stably expressing the Y-5 receptor. In these cells, 10 nM pNPY inhibited the forskolin-stimulated cAMP synthesis by 75%. This effect was partially antagonized by the Y-5 antagonist N-{trans-[4-(2-naphthylmethylamino)- methyl]cyclohexylmethyl}naphthalene-2-sulfonamide. Although the genetic variability of cancer cells is in principle incompatible with a stable phenotype, both ligand binding characteristics and functionality of the Y-5 receptor remained unchanged for more than 30 passages.

Previous molecular imaging studies have suggested lower levels of D2-R in thalamus, but results are inconclusive. The objective of the present study was to use improved methodology to compare D2-R density in whole thalamus and thalamic subregions between first-episode psychosis patients and healthy controls. Differences in thalamocortical connectivity was explored based on the D2-R results. 19 antipsychotic-naive first-episode psychosis patients and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were examined using high-resolution Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and the high-affinity D2-R radioligand [C-11]FLB457. The main outcome was D2-R binding potential (BPND) in thalamus, and it was predicted that patients would have lower binding. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was performed in a subgroup of 11 patients and 15 controls. D2-R binding in whole thalamus was lower in patients compared with controls (Cohen's dz = -0.479, p = 0.026, Bayes Factor (BF) > 4). Among subregions, lower BPND was observed in the ROI representing thalamic connectivity to the frontal cortex (Cohen's dz = -0.527, p = 0.017, BF > 6). A meta-analysis, including the sample of this study, confirmed significantly lower thalamic D2-R availability in patients. Exploratory analyses suggested that patients had lower fractional anisotropy values compared with controls (Cohen's d = -0.692, p = 0.036) in the inferior thalamic radiation. The findings support the hypothesis of a dysregulation of thalamic dopaminergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia, and it is hypothesized that this could underlie a disturbance of thalamocortical connectivity.

Part 2: Selection and Evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PS13 for Quantitative Imaging	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						COX-1; PET; radioligand; brain; carbon-11; fluorine-18	FREE-FRACTION; IN-VIVO; BINDING; CYCLOOXYGENASE-1; TRANSPORTER; MICROGLIA; PROBES	In our preceding paper (Part 1), we identified three 1,5-bis-diaryl-1,2,4-triazole-based compounds that merited evaluation as potential positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for selectively imaging cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in monkey and human brain, namely, 1,5-bis(4-methoxypheny1)-3-(alkoxy)-1H-1,2,4-triazoles bearing a 3-methoxy (PS1), a 3-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy) (PS13), or a 3-fluoromethoxy substituent (PS2). PS1 and PS13 were labeled from phenol precursors by O-C-11-methylation with [C-11]-iodomethane and PS2 by O-F-18-fluoroalkylation with [H-2(2),F-18]fluorobromomethane. Here, we evaluated these PET radioligands in monkey. All three radioligands gave moderately high uptake in brain, although [H-2(2),F-18]PS2 also showed undesirable radioactivity uptake in skull. [C-11]PS13 was selected for further evaluation, mainly based on more favorable brain kinetics than [C-11]PS1. Pharmacological preblock experiments showed that about 55% of the radioactivity uptake in brain was specifically bound to COX-1. An index of enzyme density, V-T, was well identified from serial brain scans and from the concentrations of parent radioligand in arterial plasma. In addition, V-T values were stable within 80 min, suggesting that brain uptake was not contaminated by radiometabolites. [C-11]PS13 successfully images and quantifies COX-1 in monkey brain, and merits further investigation for imaging COX-1 in monkey models of neuroinflammation and in healthy human subjects.

To do this we cloned and expressed CCR5 from rhesus macaque and compared the binding properties of [I-125] -MIP-1 beta and [H-3]-maraviroc with human recombinant CCR5. [I-125]-MIP-1 beta bound with similar high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (K-d = 0.24 +/- 0.05 nM) and human (K-d = 0.23 +/- 0.05 nM) and with similar kinetic properties. In competition binding studies the affinity of a range of human chemokines for macaque CCR5 was also similar to human CCR5. Maraviroc inhibited binding of [I-125]-MIP-1 beta to CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 1.24 nM and 7.18 +/- 0.93 nM, respectively) and antagonised MIP-1 beta induced intracellular calcium release mediated through CCR5 from macaque and human with similar potency (IC50 = 17.50 +/- 3.30 nM and 12.07 +/- 1.89, respectively). [3 H]maraviroc bound with high affinity to CCR5 from macaque (Kd = 1.36 +/- 0.07 nM) and human (Kd = 0.86 +/- 0.08 nM), but was found to dissociate similar to 10-fold more quickly from macaque CCR5. However, as with the human receptor, maraviroc was shown to be a high affinity, potent functional antagonist of macaque CCR5 thereby indicating that the macaque should be a suitable species in which to evaluate the pharmacology, safety and potential mechanism-related toxicology of novel CCR5 antagonists.

Better insight into the pathophysiology of this phenomenon could lead to more adequate diagnosis and treatment. Indirect in vivo research on peripheral body fluids and post-mortem studies in impulsive animals and humans indicate a deficient serotonergic system in general and disturbances in the serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor in particular. In this study, brain perfusion and the 5-HT2A receptors were examined in impulsive, aggressive dogs, in comparison with a group of normally behaving animals. In order to decide which dogs to include in this study, owners were asked to describe the general behaviour of the dogs, the circumstances in which aggression occurred and their conduct during aggressive acts. Finally, 19 dogs were retained for this study, showing, according to different behavioural specialists, disinhibited dominance aggression. Functional imaging studies were performed on all these dogs. Single-photon emission tomography (SPET) was used to measure regional brain perfusion using technetium-99m labelled ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD). The 5-HT2A receptor binding properties were investigated using the selective radioligand iodine-123 labelled 5-I-R91150. A significant increase in uptake of the 5-HT2A radioligand was noted in all cortical areas. No significant alterations were found in regional cortical perfusion, indicating that the increased binding index was not a consequence of increased tracer delivery. This study supports a role for the serotonergic system in canine impulsive aggression.

Saturation analysis of [H-3]-SB-269970 binding to mouse forebrain. rat cortex. pig cortex, marmoset cortex and human thalamus membrane, was consistent with labelling a homogenous population of binding sites in each tissue. K-D values for [H-3]-SB-269970 binding in these tissues ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 nM, being similar to those reported for the human cloned and guinea pig cortex 5-HT7 receptors (1.3 and 1.7 nM, respectively). B-max values for [H-3]-SB-269970 binding to the Mouse. rat. pig. marmoset and human brain membranes were 20, 30. 31, 14 and 68 fmoles mg protein(-1). respectively. For each species the profile of inhibition of [H-3]-SB-269970 binding. using a number of 5-HT7 receptor agonists and antagonists. correlated well with that reported for the human cloned 5-HT7(a) receptor (correlation coefficients were 0.95. 0.94. 0.92. 0.95, 0.97 versus the mouse. rat. pig, marmoset and human tissues, respectively). In conclusion. [H-3[-SB-269970 has been shown to radiolabel 5-HT7 receptors in rodent. pig and primate brain and represents a valuable tool with which to further characterise the distribution and function of 5-HT7 receptors in native tissues and elucidate their potential role in disease states.

These effects suggest an involvement of LTB4 in several diseases: inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, arthritis, and asthma. LTB4 elicits actions through interaction with one or more cell surface receptors that lead to chemotaxis and inflammation, One leukotriene B-4 receptor-has been recently identified (LTB4-R1). In this report we describe cloning of a cDNA encoding a novel 358-amino acid receptor (LTB4-R2) that possesses seven membrane-spanning domains and is homologous (42%) and genetically linked to LTB4-R1. Expression of LTB4-R2 is broad but highest in liver, intestine, spleen, and kidney. In radioligand binding assays, membranes prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with LTB4-R2 cDNA displayed high affinity (K-d = 0.17 nM) for [H-3]LTB4. Radioligand competition assays revealed high affinities of the receptor for LTB4 and LTB5, and 20-hydroxy-LTB4, and intermediate affinities for 15(5)HETE and 12-oxo-ETE. Three LTB, receptor antagonistst 14,15-dehydro-LTB4, LTB4-3-aminopropylamide, and U-75302, had high affinity for LTB4-R1 but not for LTB4-R2. No apparent affinity binding for the receptors was detected for the CysLT1-selective antagonists montelukast and zafirlukast. LTB, functionally mobilized intracellular calcium and inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP production in 293 cells. The discovery of this new receptor should aid in further understanding the roles of LTB, in pathologies in these tissues and may provide a tool in identification of specific antagonists/ agonists for potential therapeutic treatments.

SHR were examined at 6 weeks (juvenile, pre-hypertensive stage), 12 weeks (young, developing hypertension) and 24 weeks (mature, established hypertension). The dihydropyridine-type Ca2+ antagonist [H-3]nicardipine was used as a radioligand. It was bound specifically to sections of rat pulmonary artery and vein. Dissociation constant (K-d) values were similar in WKY rats and SHR, whereas maximum density of binding sites (B-max) values increased in SHR in comparison with WKY rats. This increase was noticeable from the pre-hypertensive phase. The pharmacological profile of [H-3]nicardipine binding was similar in different age groups of either normotensive and hypertensive rats. Quantitative analysis of autoradiographs from SHR revealed a progressive increase of silver grains in smooth muscle of tunica media and to a lesser extent in the adventitia of pulmonary artery but not of pulmonary Vein from pre-hypertensive stage to developing hypertension. No further changes were observed in established hypertension. The above data indicate that the density of L-type Ca2+ channels of pulmonary arteries is increased in SHR. This augmentation after the pre-hypertensive phase suggests the occurrence of dysregulation of Ca2+ handling in the pulmonary vasculature of developing SHR. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Allosteric ligands offer a number of advantages over orthosteric drugs, including the potential for greater receptor subtype selectivity and a more 'physiological' regulation of receptor activity. However, the manifestations of allosterism at G-protein-coupled receptors are quite varied, and significant challenges remain for the optimization of screening methods to ensure the routine detection and validation of allosteric ligands.

Although (-)6-ethylnicotine (3) binds with high affinity at nACh receptors (K-i = 5.6 nM) and produces nicotine-like actions, its n-propyl homologue (-)4 (K-i = 22 nM) failed to produce such effects. In fact, (-)4 antagonized the antinociceptive effects of (-)nicotine in the tail-flick assay in mice, but not the spontaneous activity or discriminative stimulus effects of (-)nicotine. Compound (-)4 appears to selectively antagonize only one of the three effects examined and is an interesting cholinergic agent for subsequent investigation. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Various studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 using a dose of 6.0 GBq and an 8-week therapy interval. However, the first prospective phase III trial (VISION) plans to use an elevated cumulative dose by applying 7.5 GBq in a 6-week interval. The aim of the present study was to compare safety and efficacy of the two aforementioned [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy regimes (7.5 GBq every 6 weeks vs. 6.0 GBq every 8 weeks). Methods A total number of 78 consecutive patients with mCRPC and a history of first-line chemotherapy were included in this retrospective analysis. The outcome of patients treated with 6.0 GBq [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 per cycle (n = 37) were compared with those treated with 7.5 GBq (n = 41) per cycle. The median therapy intervals were 8.4 weeks (6.0 GBq group) vs. 6.5 (7.5 GBq group). PSA response, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), overall survival, and adverse events were evaluated and compared between both groups. Chi-squared test, Kaplan Meier estimates, Cox regression, and log-rank test were used. The highest decline from pretherapeutic PSA levels was measured as percentage (best PSA response) and compared between groups by Wilcoxon test. Results There was no significant difference comparing the rate of > 50% PSA decline or best PSA response between the 6.0 GBq and 7.5 GBq group (35% vs. 54%, p = 0.065; and - 40.2% vs. - 57.8%, p = 0.329). The median estimated survival and PSA-PFS did not significantly differ between the 6.0 GBq and 7.5 GBq groups as well (11.3 vs. 12.7 months, p = 0.384; and 9.5 vs. 12.3 months, p = 0.258). There was no significant difference regarding the change of kidney, liver, and blood cell parameters under therapy between the treatment groups. Conclusion Higher cumulated doses of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 were well tolerated and caused no significantly increased rate of adverse reactions. Moreover, 7.5 GBq of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 every 6 weeks causes slightly higher, though not statistically significant, response rates and seems therefore to be the preferable treatment regime. However, future studies are needed to elucidate the dose-related efficacy of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 as a way to personalized medicine.

The PET radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 (C-11-WAY), where WAY-100635 is H-3-(N-(2-(1-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide, is commonly used for quantitation of 5-HT1A receptors in the human brain. The aim of this PET study was to compare C-11-WAY with the putative metabolite and selective radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]desmethyl-WAY-100635 (C-11-DWAY). Methods: A PET examination was performed on each of 5 healthy male volunteers after intravenous injection of C-11-WAY and C-11-DWAY on separate occasions. Radioactive metabolites in plasma were determined with high-performance liquid chromatography. The plasma metabolite-corrected input function was used in a kinetic compartment analysis. The simplified reference tissue model and peak equilibrium method, using the cerebellum as reference region, was applied for comparison of data. Results: For both radioligands, the highest radioactivity was observed in the neocortex and the raphe nuclei, whereas radioactivity was low in the cerebellum. The regional binding potentials were similar for the 2 radioligands. The brain uptake was more than 2-fold higher for C-11-DWAY than for C-11-WAY, in part because of higher delivery (first-order rate constant K-1, 0.38 vs. 0.16). The time-activity curves were well described by a 3-compartment model for all regions, whereas uptake in the cerebellum could not be described by a 2-compartment model, supporting the existence of kinetically distinguishable nonspecific binding in the cerebellum or radioactive metabolites in the brain for both radioligands. Both radioligands were rapidly metabolized, and <10% of the radioactivity in plasma represented unchanged C-11-WAY or C-11-DWAY at 10 min after injection. The metabolic pattern was similar for both radioligands, with the formation of radiolabeled cyclohexanecarboxylic acid and more polar components. For C-11-WAY, small amounts of an additional labeled metabolite comigrated with reference desmethyl-WAY-100635. Conclusion: The advantages of C-11-DWAY over C-11-WAY for research on central 5-HT1A receptors is supported by a significantly higher radioactivity signal at equipotent doses, providing improved imaging statistics and advantages in biomathematic modeling and the preclusion of C-11-DWAY as a metabolite interfering with PET measurements.

Harnessing the Bioorthogonal Inverse Electron Demand Diels-Alder Cycloaddition for Pretargeted PET Imaging	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Bioengineering; Issue 96; Positron Emission Tomography; Click Chemistry; Pretargeting; Tetrazine; Trans-cyclooctene; Inverse Electron Demand Diels-Alder Cycloaddition	IN-VIVO CHEMISTRY; CANCER; ANTIBODIES; CONSTRUCTION; LIGATION; STRATEGY	Due to their exquisite affinity and specificity, antibodies have become extremely promising vectors for the delivery of radioisotopes to cancer cells for PET imaging. However, the necessity of labeling antibodies with radionuclides with long physical half-lives often results in high background radiation dose rates to non-target tissues. In order to circumvent this issue, we have employed a pretargeted PET imaging strategy based on the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction. The methodology decouples the antibody from the radioactivity and thus exploits the positive characteristics of antibodies, while eschewing their pharmacokinetic drawbacks. The system is composed of four steps: (1) the injection of a mAb-trans-cyclooctene (TCO) conjugate; (2) a localization time period during which the antibody accumulates in the tumor and clears from the blood; (3) the injection of the radiolabeled tetrazine; and (4) the in vivo click ligation of the components followed by the clearance of excess radioligand. In the example presented in the work at hand, a Cu-64-NOTA-labeled tetrazine radioligand and a trans-cyclooctene-conjugated humanized antibody (huA33) were successfully used to delineate SW1222 colorectal cancer tumors with high tumor-to-background contrast. Further, the pretargeting methodology produces high quality images at only a fraction of the radiation dose to non-target tissue created by radioimmunoconjugates directly labeled with Cu-64 or Zr-89. Ultimately, the modularity of this protocol is one of its greatest assets, as the trans-cyclooctene moiety can be appended to any non-internalizing antibody, and the tetrazine can be attached to a wide variety of radioisotopes.

Previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies on the association between Val66Met and 5-HTT and 5-HT1A binding potential (BPND) have demonstrated equivocal results. Methods: We conducted an imaging genetics study investigating the effect of Val66Met genotype on 5-HTT or 5-HT1A BPND in 92 subjects. Forty-one subjects (25 healthy subjects and 16 depressive patients) underwent genotyping for Val66Met and PET imaging with the 5-HTT specific radioligand [C-11]DASB. Additionally, in 51 healthy subjects Val66Met genotypes and 5-HT1A binding with the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 were ascertained. Voxel-wise and region of interest-based analyses of variance were used to examine the influence of Val66Met on 5-HTT and 5-HT1A BPND. Results: No significant differences of 5-HTT nor 5-HT1A BPND between BDNF Val66Met genotype groups (val/val vs. met-carrier) were detected. There was no interaction between depression and Val66Met genotype status. Conclusion: In line with previous data, our work confirms an absent effect of BDNF Val66Met on two major serotonergic structures. These results could suggest that altered protein expression associated with genetic variants, might be compensated in vivo by several levels of unknown feedback mechanisms. In conclusion, Val66Met genotype status is not associated with changes of in-vivo binding of 5-HTT and 5-HT1A receptors in human subjects.

Interaction between serotonin transporter and dopamine D2/D3 receptor radioligand measures is associated with harm avoidant symptoms in anorexia and bulimia nervosa	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING			English	Article						Anorexia nervosa; Bulimia nervosa; Positron emission tomography; Dopamine; Serotonin; Harm avoidance	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; LONG-TERM STABILITY; BRAIN-SEROTONIN; IN-VIVO; PERSONALITY-TRAITS; EATING-DISORDERS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; D-2 RECEPTORS; BINDING	Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) have alterations of measures of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) function, which persist after long-term recovery and are associated with elevated harm avoidance (HA), a measure of anxiety and behavioral inhibition. Based on theories that 5-HT is an aversive motivational system that may oppose a DA-related appetitive system, we explored interactions of positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand measures that reflect portions of these systems. Twenty-seven individuals recovered (REC) from eating disorders (EDs) (7 AN-BN, 11 AN, 9 BN) and nine control women (CW) were analyzed for correlations between [C-11]McN5652 and [C-11]raclopride binding. There was a significant positive correlation between [C-11]McN5652 binding potential (BPnon displaceable(ND)) and [C-11]Raclopride BPND for the dorsal caudate, antero-ventral striatum (AVS), middle caudate, and ventral and dorsal putamen. No significant correlations were found in CW. [C-11]Raclopride BPND, but not [C-11]McN5652 BPND, was significantly related to HA in REC EDs. A linear regression analysis showed that the interaction between [C-11]McN5652 BPND and [C-11]raclopride BPND in the dorsal putamen significantly predicted HA. This is the first study using PET and the radioligands [C-11]McN5652 and [C-11]raclopride to show a direct relationship between 5-HT transporter and striatal DA D2/D3 receptor binding in humans, supporting the possibility that 5-HT and DA interactions contribute to HA behaviors in EDs.

Binding properties of [H-3]DADN were measured in crude membrane fractions of rat spinal cord tissues and in homogenates of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells selectively expressing delta-, kappa- or mu-opioid receptors. The highest affinity for [H-3]DADN binding was observed in membranes from CHO cells transfected with mu-opioid receptors confirming the mu-selectivity of the peptide. Unlabeled DADN was also investigated in functional biochemical experiments by measuring opioid receptor-mediated G-protein activation in rat brain membrane fractions. The peptide stimulated the activity of the regulatory G-proteins in a concentration dependent manner, and the stimulation was efficiently inhibited in the presence of mu-receptor specific antagonist ligands further supporting the selectivity profile of DADN. Intrathecally administered DADN produced a dose-related, naloxone-reversible antinociception in rat hot water tail-flick tests. Among the selective opioid antagonists tested, the delta-selective naltrindole (NTI) and the kappa-specific norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) showed only slight blocking effects compared with naloxone. The results obtained in the in vitro agonist-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding assays are in good agreement with the opioid agonist effect seen in the in vivo pain test. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, little is known about the post-partum development of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). METHOD OF STUDY: We examined 18 patients who developed liver dysfunction after delivery or abortion. Serial examinations were performed in 10 of these cases. Anti-cytochrome 2D6(CYP2D6) antibodies, which are liver-specific autoantibodies, were measured using a sensitive radioligand assay. RESULTS: Liver dysfunction developed between I and 5 months after delivery and was mild and transient except in one case. One patient developed liver dysfunction after abortion. Eight of 10 patients who underwent serial serologic examinations were positive for antinuclear antibodies, but anti-smooth muscle antibodies were positive in only three patients, and were present only at low titer. None of the patients had anti-mitochondrial antibodies. Nine of these 10 cases were diagnosed as definite or probable AIH according to the international scoring system of AIH. Nine of these 10 patients were positive for anti-CYP2D6 antibodies. The increase of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies was slightly delayed compared to increase of aminotransferase. Of the 18 patients who developed liver dysfunction, 15 cases (83.3%) were positive for anti-CYP2D6 antibodies. Of the 77 post-partum control subjects only three (3.9%) had positive antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune hepatitis developed after delivery, similarly to the development of post-partum autoimmune thyroid disease. Measurement of anti-CYP2D6 antibodies by a sensitive radioligand assay could provide information important for the detection of post-partum AIH.

The results are consistent with an allosteric model in which the primary and allosteric ligands bind simultaneously to the receptor and modify each other's affinities. The compounds were generally most active at M-1 receptors. [H-3] NMS binding was enhanced by staurosporine, KT5720, and KT5823 at M-1 and M-2 receptors, and by K-252a at M-1 receptors. Go 7874 reduced [H-3] NMS affinity by up to threefold for all subtypes. A range of cooperative effects with acetylcholine was seen, and, at the M1 receptor, KT5720 had a log affinity of 6.4 and enhanced acetylcholine affinity by 40%. The compounds inhibited the dissociation of [H-3] NMS to different extents across the receptor subtypes, with the largest effects at M-1 receptors. In equilibrium binding studies the inhibitory potency of gallamine at M-1 receptors was not affected by KT5720, indicating that these agents bind to two distinct allosteric sites and have neutral cooperativity with each other. In contrast, gallamine and staurosporine had a negatively cooperative or competitive interaction at M-1 receptors. Similarly, the potency and relative effectiveness of KT5720 for inhibiting [H-3] NMS dissociation from M-1 receptors were not affected by gallamine or brucine, but were affected in a complex manner by staurosporine. These results demonstrate that there are at least two distinct allosteric sites on the M-1 receptor, both of which can support positive cooperativity with acetylcholine.

C-11-PBR28, F-18-FDG, and C-11-PIB brain PET scans, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were conducted in four FTLD patients and 22 healthy controls. C-11-PBR28 scans revealed that all FTLD patients showed increased TSPO binding versus controls. Significantly greater increases in TSPO were observed in the frontal, lateral temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices, topographically consistent with individual clinical phenotypes and with brain MRI and F-18-FDG PET. Amyloid burden was not increased.

The rTg4510 mouse line expressing human tau with P301L FTDP-17-tau mutation has been established to understand the role of tau in neurodegeneration. Our histological analyses with tau antibodies and fluorescent tau ligands on rTg4510 mice revealed that tau oligomer formation was distinct from tangle formation. While in vivo imaging of mature tangles is now available, imaging biomarkers for tau oligomers would be useful for clarifying their roles in neurotoxicity and for diagnosing early-stage tau pathology.

Separation was effected on a RP-C18 column, using a mixture of acetonitrile-water-triethylamine (70/30/0.5, v/v). ITX was rapidly cleared from human plasma and metabolites appeared as early as 7.5 min p.i. Quantitative assessment of metabolites in plasma over time allowed recalculation of the ITX plasma time-activity curve. Implications of ITX metabolite formation for breast tumour imaging are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The affinity and the specificity of the polymers towards the template were evaluated by radioligand immunoassay. The polymer prepared in toluene with 4-vinylpyridine as functional monomer and ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate as crosslinker was found to have a strong and highly selective affinity for 17 alpha-ethynylestradiol. A comparison with the natural antibody indicated that the recognition properties of the polymer towards several structurally related steroids were similar or superior to those of the antibody. The results show that it is possible to make a successful polymeric receptor site for a lipophilic molecule that can provide only two potential points of hydrogen bonding interaction.

Initial Evaluation of <SUP>18</SUP>F-GE-179, a Putative PET Tracer for Activated <i>N</i>-Methyl D-Aspartate Receptors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						NMDA; PET; GE-179; CNS 5161	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NMDA ION-CHANNEL; HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; CEREBRAL-ISCHEMIA; SPECTRAL-ANALYSIS; MESSENGER-RNAS; TEMPORAL-LOBE	N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) ion channels play a key role in a wide range of physiologic (e.g., memory and learning tasks) and pathologic processes (e.g., excitotoxicity). To date, suitable PET markers of NMDA ion channel activity have not been available. F-18-GE-179 is a novel radioligand that selectively binds to the open/active state of the NMDA receptor ion channel, displacing the binding of H-3-teno-cyclidine from the intrachannel binding site with an affinity of 2.4 nM. No significant binding was observed with 10 nM GE-179 at 60 other neuroreceptors, channels, or transporters. We describe the kinetic behavior of the radioligand in vivo in humans. Methods: Nine healthy participants (6 men, 3 women; median age, 37 y) each underwent a 90-min PET scan after an intravenous injection of F-18-GE-179. Continuous arterial blood sampling over the first 15 min was followed by discrete blood sampling over the duration of the scan. Brain radioactivity (KBq/mL) was measured in summation images created from the attenuation- and motion-corrected dynamic images. Metabolite-corrected parent plasma input functions were generated. We assessed the abilities of 1-, 2-, and 3-compartment models to kinetically describe cerebral time-activity curves using 6 bilateral regions of interest. Parametric volume-of-distribution (V-T) images were generated by voxelwise rank-shaping regularization of exponential spectral analysis (RS-ESA). Results: A 2-brain-compartment, 4-rate-constant model best described the radioligand's kinetics in normal gray matter of subjects at rest. At 30 min after injection, 37% of plasma radioactivity represented unmetabolized F-18-GE-179. The highest mean levels of gray matter radioactivity were seen in the putamina and peaked at 7.5 min. A significant positive correlation was observed between K-1 and V-T (Spearman rho = 0.398; P = 0.003). Between-subject coefficients of variation of V-T ranged between 12% and 16%. Voxelwise RS-ESA yielded similar VTS and coefficients of variation. Conclusion: F-18-GE-179 exhibits high and rapid brain extraction, with a relatively homogeneous distribution in gray matter and acceptable between-subject variability. Despite its rapid peripheral metabolism, quantification of F-18-GE-179 V-T is feasible both within regions of interest and at the voxel level. The specificity of F-18-GE-179 binding, however, requires further characterization with in vivo studies using activation and disease models.

Animal data show marked brain microglial activation following acute high-dose MA, but microglial status in human MA users is uncertain, with one positron emission tomography (PET) investigation reporting massively and globally increased translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO; [C-11](R)-PK11195) binding, a biomarker for microgliosis, in MA users. Our aim was to measure binding of a second-generation TSPO radioligand, [F-18]FEPPA, in brain of human chronic MA users. Regional total volume of distribution (V-T) of [F-18]FEPPA was estimated with a two-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma input function for 10 regions of interest in 11 actively using MA users and 26 controls. A RM-ANOVA corrected for TSPO rs6971 polymorphism was employed to test significance. There was no main effect of group on [F-18]FEPPA V-T (P = .81). No significant correlations between [F-18]FEPPA V-T and MA use duration, weekly dosage, blood MA concentrations, regional brain volumes, and self-reported craving were observed. Our preliminary findings, consistent with our earlier postmortem data, do not suggest substantial brain microgliosis in MA use disorder but do not rule out microglia as a therapeutic target in MA addiction. Absence of increased [F-18]FEPPA TSPO binding might be related to insufficient MA dose or blunting of microglial response following repeated MA exposure, as suggested by some animal data.

Measuring endogenous changes in serotonergic neurotransmission with [<SUP>11</SUP>C] Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography in humans	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ACUTE-TRYPTOPHAN-DEPLETION; TEST-RETEST REPRODUCIBILITY; IN-VIVO BINDING; 5-HT2A RECEPTOR; HUMAN BRAIN; NONHUMAN; VULNERABILITY; RADIOLIGAND; RADIOTRACER; TRANSPORTER	Developing positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for the detection of endogenous serotonin release will enable the investigation of serotonergic deficits in many neuropsychiatric disorders. The present study investigates how acute challenges that aim to increase or decrease cerebral serotonin levels affect binding of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist radioligand [C-11]Cimbi-36. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-arm design, 23 healthy volunteers were PET scanned twice with [C-11]Cimbi-36: at baseline and following double-blind assignment to one of three interventions (1) infusion of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram preceded by oral dosing of the 5-HT1AR antagonist pindolol, (n = 8) (2) acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) (n = 7) and (3) placebo (n = 8). Two-sample t-tests revealed no significant group differences in percent change of neocortical [C-11] Cimbi-36 binding from baseline to intervention between placebo and citalopram/pindolol (p = 0.4) or between placebo and ATD (p = 0.5). Notably, there was a significantly larger within-group variation in 5-HT2AR binding after intervention with citalopram/pindolol, as compared with placebo (p = 0.007). These findings suggest that neither ATD nor a combination of citalopram and pindolol elicit acute unidirectional changes in serotonin levels sufficient to be detected with [C-11]Cimbi-36 PET in neocortex. We suggest that the large interindividual variation in 5-HT2AR binding after citalopram/pindolol reflects that after an acute SSRI intervention, individuals respond substantially different in terms of their brain serotonin levels. Our observation has a potential impact for the understanding of patient responses to SSRI.

Tiagabine (Gabitril) is an anticonvulsive drug that binds selectively to GABA transporter-1 and thereby inhibits GABA uptake. As radioligands for in-vivo imaging of the GABA transporter are not yet available, we radiolabelled tiagabine and assessed its efficacy for in-vivo imaging of these transporters. Tiagabine was first brominated at its vinylic part, which was then exchanged with I-123. Next, anaesthetized rats received a bolus injection of [I-123]iodotiagabine in their tail vein, which was immediately followed by acquisition of planar and high-resolution micro-single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of the total body with special focus on the brain. Uptake in anatomical regions was assessed by coregistration of micro-SPECT with micro-CT images. Tiagabine labelling with I-123 resulted in 50% yield and 99.7% radiochemical purity. Within 3 h after injection, SPECT demonstrated an increased signal-to-background ratio in the nasal mucosa and/or the Harderian glands but not in the brain. In addition we observed an increased signal-to-background ratio in organs such as the thyroid, heart, liver, kidney and bladder. More than 99% pure I-123-labelled tiagabine can be obtained and applied in animal micro-SPECT studies. However, this new radioligand is not taken up sufficiently by the brain and therefore cannot be used to successfully detect cerebral GABA transporters.

We previously synthesized 2-iodo-N6-methy1-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MR52500), as a selective, high-affinity, competitive antagonist of this receptor. Here we report utilization of a trimethylstannyl precursor molecule for the multi-step radiochemical synthesis of a [I-125]-labeled form of MRS2500. [I-125]MRS2500 bound selectively to Sf9 insect cell membranes expressing the human P2Y(1) receptor but did not specifically bind to membranes isolated from empty vector-infected cells. Binding of [I-125]MRS2500 to P2Y(1) receptors was saturable with a Kd of 1.2 nM. Known agonists and antagonists of the P2Y(1) receptor inhibited [I-125]MRS2500 binding to P2Y(1) receptor-expressing membranes with potencies in agreement with those previously observed in functional assays of this receptor. A high-affinity binding site for [I-125]MRS2500 also was observed on intact human platelets (Kd = 0.61 nM) and mouse platelets (Kd =1.20 nM) that exhibited the pharmacological selectivity of the P2Y(1) receptor. The densities of sites observed were 151 sites/platelet and 229 sites/platelet in human and mouse platelets, respectively. In contrast, specific binding was not observed in platelets isolated from P2Y(1) receptor(-/-) mice. Taken together, these data illustrate the synthesis and characterization of a novel P2Y(1) receptor radioligand and its utility for examining P2Y(1) receptors natively expressed on human and mouse platelets.

In the present Study, we have developed a new graphic plot analysis to determine the total distribution volume (V(T)) and nondisplaceable distribution volume (V(ND)) independently, and therefore the binding potential (BP(ND)). In this plot, Y(t) is the ratio of brain tissue activity to time-integrated arterial input function, and X(t) is the ratio of time-integrated brain tissue activity to time-integrated arterial input function. The x-intercept of linear regression of the plots for early phase represents V(ND), and the x-intercept of linear regression of the plots for delayed phase after the equilibrium time represents V(T). BP(ND) can be calculated by BP(ND) = V(T)/V(ND) - 1. Dynamic PET scanning with measurement of arterial input function was performed on six healthy men after intravenous rapid bolus injection of [(11)C]FLB457. The plot yielded a curve in regions with specific binding while it yielded a straight line through all plot data in regions with no specific binding. V(ND), V(T), and BP(ND) values calculated by the present method were in good agreement with those by conventional non-linear least-squares fitting procedure. This method can be used to distinguish graphically whether the radioligand binding includes specific binding or not. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Wong Kai			PSNCBAM-1, a novel allosteric antagonist at cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors with hypophagic effects in rats	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						allosteric modulator; cannabinoid receptor; antagonist	FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MODULATION; AGONIST; ACTIVATION; WEIGHT	Background and purpose: Rimonabant ( Acomplia (TM), SR141716A), a cannabinoid CB1 receptor inverse agonist, has recently been approved for the treatment of obesity. There are, however, concerns regarding its side effect profile. Developing a CB1 antagonist with a different pharmacological mechanism may lead to a safer alternative. To this end we have screened a proprietary small molecule library and have discovered a novel class of allosteric antagonist at CB1 receptors. Herein, we have characterized an optimized prototypical molecule, PSNCBAM-1, and its hypophagic effects in vivo. Experimental approach: A CB1 yeast reporter assay was used as a primary screen. PSNCBAM-1 was additionally characterized in [ S-35]-GTP gamma S, cAMP and radioligand binding assays. An acute rat feeding model was used to evaluate its effects on food intake and body weight in vivo. Key results: In CB1 receptor yeast reporter assays, PSNCBAM-1 blocked the effects induced by agonists such as CP55,940, WIN55212-2, anandamide (AEA) or 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG). The antagonist characteristics of PSNCBAM-1 were confirmed in [S-35]-GTPgS binding and cAMP assays and was shown to be non-competitive by Schild analyses. PSNCBAM-1 did not affect CB2 receptors. In radioligand binding assays, PSNCBAM-1 increased the binding of [H-3] CP55,940 despite its antagonist effects. In an acute rat feeding model, PSNCBAM-1 decreased food intake and body weight. Conclusions and implications: PSNCBAM-1 exerted its effects through selective allosteric modulation of the CB1 receptor. The acute effects on food intake and body weight induced in rats provide a first report of in vivo activity for an allosteric CB1 receptor antagonist.

Methods: IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG were measured with radioligand binding assays (RBA) using human recombinant (hr) S-35-tTG produced in lysate of rabbit reticulocytes and with guinea pig (gp) tTG ELISA in 51 CD children (median: 5.7 years) and 35 controls (median: 2.2 years). Assays were performed with and without calcium. Results: In hr-tTG RBA, IgA-tTG levels remained unchanged after calcium detecting 50151 CD children and 1135 controls (p < 0.0001). IgG-tTG levels decreased with calcium (p < 0.0001) in CD children and detected 48/51 with and 49/51 without calcium as compared to 1/35 controls (p < 0.0001). In gp-tTG ELISA, levels increased with calcium (p < 0.0001) making it possible to detect an additional three to a total of 50151 with IgA-tTG and 13 to 39/51 CD children with IgG-tTG compared to 4/35 and 8/35 controls (respectively, p < 0.0001). Rabbit reticulocytes displayed calcium-dependent tTG activity. Conclusions: Calcium increased binding of IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG in the ELISA test. The reverse effect observed in RBA may be explained by competitive binding between calcium activated native rabbit reticulocyte tTG and hr S-35-tTG. tTG autoantibody assays may need taking calcium into account for accurate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for CD.

The standard screening assays used in regular molecular pharmacology, have been poorly assessed when transposed to combinatorial chemistry-related experiments, particularly those involving large numbers of chemicals in a single assay. One key issue is the effect of the inactive analogs on the identification of the active ligand in mixtures. We chose melatonin receptors to measure the apparent affinity of a single ligand when tested alone or in mixtures of non-peptide low molecular weight compounds. Using ligands with IC50 from the micro- to the picomolar range, mixed with increasingly complex mixtures of 5 to 20 or 25 inactive compounds, we analyzed the displacements from the mt(1) and MT2 melatonin receptor subtypes of the radioligand 2-iodomelatonin (K-D = 25 pmol/l and 200 pmol/l, respectively). The behavior of equimolar mixtures in displacement curves led to the conclusion that the observed binding affinity reflects the dilution effect of mixing the active component with inactive compounds but does not reveal noticeable interactions which would interfere with the binding process. From the practical point of view, the concentrations of the active species in the binding assay should be large enough to displace significantly the radioligand, a requirement which may be limited by the solubility of the ligand mixtures. In contrast, previous observations with peptide libraries report that the dilution effect is often compensated by additive or synergic action of structurally related analogs,thus making possible the deconvolution of very large (typically up to 10(7) compounds) peptide libraries.

Trifunctional PSMA-targeting constructs for prostate cancer with unprecedented localization to LNCaP tumors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						PSMA; Albumin; Prostate cancer; Targeted radioligand therapy; Pharmacokinetics	LU-177-PSMA-617 RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; I-AND-T; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; SALIVARY-GLAND; MOUSE HOMOLOG; INHIBITORS; BINDING; ENDORADIOTHERAPY	PurposeTreatment of late-stage prostate cancer by targeted radiotherapeutics such as I-131-MIP-1095 and Lu-177-PSMA-617 has shown encouraging early results. Lu-177 is preferred to I-131 in clinical settings, but targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA-617 has not reached its full potential due to insufficient dose delivery to the tumor. We recently developed a dual-targeting radioiodinated ligand, RPS-027, that targets PSMA and uses albumin binding to enable good tumor uptake and significantly reduced kidney uptake in a preclinical model. Further development of this ligand is limited by the inability to independently modify PSMA and albumin binding and the requirement of I-131 for therapeutic application. We therefore sought to devise a new class of trifunctional ligands for RLT with (1) a high-affinity PSMA-binding domain, (2) an albumin-binding group (ABG), and (3) a chelator for radiometals such as Ga-68(3+), Lu-177(3+) and Ac-225(3+).MethodsLigands incorporating a triazolylphenylurea-containing PSMA-targeting group, an N-epsilon-(2-(4-iodophenyl)acetyl)lysine ABG and the bifunctional chelator p-SCN-Bn-DOTA linked by a PEG-containing polymer containing 0,3,4,6,8 or 12 repeats were prepared. PSMA affinity was determined in LNCaP cells and uptake and tissue distribution was studied in mice bearing LNCaP tumor xenografts and compared to Lu-177-PSMA-617. Imaging studies were performed up to 24h post-injection (p.i.) using Ga-66(3+) and biodistribution studies at 4h, 24h and 96h p.i. with Lu-177(3+).ResultsPSMA affinity was high (IC50=1-10nM) and inversely proportional to the linker length. Tumor uptake correlated with binding affinity and was significantly greater than for Lu-177-PSMA-617 over 96h. The highest uptake was achieved with Lu-177-RPS-063 (30.06.9 %ID/g; 4h p.i.). Kidney uptake was generally high, with the exception of the lowest affinity ligand Lu-177-RPS-067. Each of the compounds showed slower blood clearance than Lu-177-PSMA-617, with clearance proportional to linker length.ConclusionsThe high tumor uptake achieved with these trifunctional ligands predicts larger (up to 4x) doses delivered to the tumor than can be achieved with Lu-177-PSMA-617. Although PSMA-mediated kidney uptake was also observed, the exceptional area under the curve (AUC) in the tumor warrants further investigation of these novel ligands as candidates for RLT.

The upregulated expression of sigma(2) receptors in cancer cells and tissue in combination with the antiproliferative potency of sigma(2) receptor ligands motivates the research in the field of sigma(2) receptors for the diagnosis and therapy of different types of cancer. Starting from the well described 2-(4-(1H-indol-1-yl)buty1)-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline class of compounds, we synthesized a novel series of fluorinated derivatives bearing the F-atom at the aromatic indole/azaindole subunit. RM273 (2-[4-(6-fluoro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridin-1-yl)butyl]-6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline) was selected for labelling with F-18 and evaluation regarding detection of sigma(2) receptors in the brain by positron emission tomography. Initial metabolism and biodistribution studies of [F-18]RM273 in healthy mice revealed promising penetration of the radioligand into the brain. Preliminary in vitro autoradiography on brain cryosections of an orthotopic rat glioblastoma model proved the potential of the radioligand to detect the upregulation of sigma(2) receptors in glioblastoma cells compared to healthy brain tissue. The results indicate that the herein developed sigma(2) receptor ligand [F-18]RM273 has potential to assess by non-invasive molecular imaging the correlation between the availability of sigma(2) receptors and properties of brain tumors such as tumor proliferation or resistance towards particular therapies.

[F-18]LBT999 was produced on a TRACERlab FXFN for the Phase I study but for Phase III and a potent industrial production transfer, production was also implemented on an AllinOne (AIO) system requiring a single use cassette. Both production methods are reported herein.ResultsAutomation of [F-18]LBT999 radiosynthesis on FXFN was carried out in 35% yield (decay-corrected) in 65min (n=16), with a radiochemical purity higher than 99% and a molar activity of 158GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis. The transfer to the AIO platform followed by optimizations allowed the production of [F-18]LBT999 in 32.7% yield (decay-corrected) within 48min (n=5), with a radiochemical purity better than 98% and a molar activity above 154GBq/mu mol on average at the end of synthesis. Quality controls of both methods met the specification for clinical application.ConclusionBoth modules allow efficient and reproducible radiosynthesis of [F-18]LBT999 with good radiochemical yields and a reasonable synthesis time. The developments made on AIO, such as its ability to meet pharmaceutical criteria and to more easily comply with GMP requirements, make it an optimal approach for the potent industrial production of [F-18]LBT999 and future wider use.

To image alpha 3 beta 4 nAChRs in vivo, we aimed to establish the synthesis of a [F-18] labelled analog of the highly affine and selective alpha 3 beta 4 ligand (S)-3-(4-(4-fluoropheny1)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-1-y1) quinuclidine ((S)-T1). (S)-[F-18]T1 was synthesized from ethynyl-4-[F-18]fluorobenzene ([P-18]5) and (S)-azidoquinuclidine by click reaction. After a synthesis time of 130 min (S)-[F-18]T1 was obtained with a radiochemical yield (non-decay corrected) of 4.3 +/- 1.3%, a radiochemical purity of > 99% and a molar activity of > 158 GBq/mu mol. The brain uptake and the brain-to-blood ratio of (S)-[18F]T1 in mice at 30 min post injection were 2.02 (SUV) and 6.1, respectively. According to an, ex-vivo analysis, the tracer remained intact ( > 99%) in brain. Only one major radiometabolite was detected in plasma and urine samples. In-vitro autoradiography on pig brain slices revealed binding of (S)[(18F)]T1 to brain regions associated with the expression of alpha 3 beta 4 nAChRs, which could be reduced by the alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR selective drug AT-1001. These findings make (S)-[18F]T1 a potential tool for the non-invasive imaging of alpha 3 beta 4 nAChRs in the brain by PET.

Multiple Binding Sites for Small-Molecule Antagonists at the CC Chemokine Receptor 2	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; DRUG DISCOVERY; ACTIVATION; IDENTIFICATION; HETERODIMERS; INFLAMMATION; EXPRESSION; MONOCYTES	The chemokine receptor CCR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that is activated primarily by the endogenous CC chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2). Many different small-molecule antagonists have been developed to inhibit this receptor, as it is involved in a variety of diseases characterized by chronic inflammation. Unfortunately, all these antagonists lack clinical efficacy, and therefore a better understanding of their mechanism of action is warranted. In this study, we examined the pharmacological properties of small-molecule CCR2 antagonists in radioligand binding and functional assays. Six structurally different antagonists were selected for this study, all of which displaced the endogenous agonist I-125-CCL2 from CCR2 with nanomolar affinity. Two of these antagonists, INCB3344 [N-(2-(((3S, 4S)-1-((1r,4S)-4-(benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-4-hydroxycyclohexyl)-4-ethoxypyrrolidin-3-yl)amino)-2-oxoethyl)-3-(trifluoromethyl)benzamide] and CCR2-RA, were radiolabeled to study the binding site in greater detail. We discovered that [H-3]INCB3344 and [H-3]CCR2-RA bind to distinct binding sites at CCR2, the latter being the first allosteric radioligand for CCR2. Besides the binding properties of the antagonists, we examined CCR2 inhibition in multiple functional assays, including a novel label-free whole-cell assay. INCB3344 competitively inhibited CCL2-induced G protein activation, whereas CCR2-RA showed a noncompetitive or allosteric mode of inhibition. These findings demonstrated that the CCR2 antagonists examined in this study can be classified into two groups with different binding sites and thereby different modes of inhibition. We have provided further insights in CCR2 antagonism, and these insights are important for the development of novel CCR2 inhibitors.	[Zweemer, Annelien J.

Herein, a novel competitive binding assay was developed employing the hematopoietic cell line of human multiple myeloma (RPMI 8226), which expresses a large amount of the human sigma(1) receptor. Membrane fragments of RPMI 8226 cells were prepared and characterized. A Western blot analysis confirmed the high density of sigma(1) receptors in this cell line. Assay conditions were carefully optimized leading to an incubation period of 120 min, an incubation temperature of 37 degrees C, and receptor material for each well was prepared from 300,000 cells. It was shown that a large excess (10 mu M) of (+)-pentazocine, haloperidol, and di-o-tolylguanidine provided the same results during determination of the nonspecific binding. Saturation experiments with the radioligand [H-3]-(4)-pentazocine led to a K-d-value of 36 +/- 0.3 nM and a B-max-value of 477 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein. These data resulted in approximately 122,000 sigma(1) binding sites per cell. The assay was validated by using six known sigma(1) ligands and eight sigma(1) ligands prepared in our lab. The K-1-values determined with RPMI 8226-derived receptor material are in good accordance with the K-i-values obtained with guinea pig brain membrane preparations. Compared with guinea pig brain preparations, the RPMI 8226-derived receptor material represents a better standardized receptor material with a high density of human sigma(1) receptors.

As often mice are used as the preferred animal model in translational research, in particular when using genetically modified mice, this study aimed to provide a systematic analysis of in vivo cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor ligand-binding capacity using positron emission tomography (PET) using the ligand [F-18]MK-9470. We then compared the PET results with literature data from immunohistochemistry (IHC) to review the consistency between ex vivo protein expression and in vivo ligand binding. Methods: Six male C57BL/6J (6-9 weeks) mice were examined with the CB1 receptor ligand [F-18]MK-9470 and small animal PET. Different brain regions were evaluated using the parameter %ID/ml. The PET results of the [F-18]MK-9470 accumulation in the mouse brain were compared with immunohistochemical literature data. Results: The ligand [F-18]MK-9470 was taken up into the mouse brain within 5 min after injection and exhibited slow kinetics. It accumulated highly in most parts of the brain. PET and IHC classifications were consistent for most parts of the telencephalon, while brain regions of the diencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon were rated higher with PET than IHC. Conclusions: This preclinical [F-18]MK-9470 study demonstrated the radioligand's applicability for imaging the region-specific CB1 receptor availability in the healthy adult mouse brain and thus offers the potential to study CB1 receptor availability in pathological conditions.

In the present work, we validate an algorithm for generating parametric map images of [C-11] CURB acquired with a high resolution research tomograph (HRRT) scanner. This algorithm applies the basis function method on an irreversible two-tissue compartment model (k(4) = 0) with arterial input function, i.e., BAFPIC. Monte Carlo simulations are employed to assess bias and variability of the binding macroparameters (K-i and k(3)) as a function of the voxel noise level and the range of basis functions. The results show that for a [C-11] CURB time activity curve with noise levels corresponding to a voxel of an image acquired with the HRRT and reconstructed with the filtered back projection algorithm, the implementation of BAFPIC requires the use of a constant vascular fraction of tissue (5%) and a cutoff for slow frequencies (0.06 min(-1)). With these settings, BAFPIC maintains the probabilistic distributions of the binding macroparameters with approximately Gaussian shape and minimizes the bias and variability for large physiological ranges of the rate constants of [C-11] CURB. BAFPIC reduces the variability of Ki to a third of that given by Patlak plot, the standard graphical method for irreversible radioligands. Application to real data demonstrated an excellent correlation between region of interest and BAFPIC parametric data and agreed with the simulations results. Therefore, BAFPIC with a constant vascular fraction can be used to generate parametric maps of [C-11] CURB images acquired with an HRRT provided that the limits of the basis functions are carefully selected.

Maternal Caffeine Intake During Gestation and Lactation Down-Regulates Adenosine A<sub>1</sub> Receptor in Rat Brain from Mothers and Neonates	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						adenosine receptor; methylxanthine; pregnancy; neonates	MESSENGER-RNA; A(2A); INTERNALIZATION; CONSUMPTION; EXPOSURE; ONTOGENY	Even though caffeine can be excreted in breast milk, few studies have analyzed the effect of maternal caffeine consumption during lactation on neonatal brain. In the present work pregnant rats were treated daily with 1 g/L of caffeine in their drinking water during pregnancy and/or lactation and the effect on adenosine A(1) receptor in brains from both lactating mothers and 15 days-old neonates was assayed using radioligand binding and real time RCA assays. Mothers receiving caffeine during gestational period developed motor activation in gestational days 8-10 which was associated with a significant decrease of total adenosine A(1) receptor number (84%). A similar decrease was detected in mothers treated with caffeine during lactation (76%) and throughout gestation and lactation (73%); this was accompanied by a significant decrease in mRNA level coding adenosine A(1) receptor (28%). In male neonates, adenosine A(1) receptor was also decreased after chronic caffeine exposure during gestation (80%), lactation (76%) and gestation plus lactation (80%). In female neonates, adenosine A(1) receptor tended to decrease in response to caffeine exposure although no significant variations were found. No variation in the level of mRNA coding adenosine A(1) receptor was detected in neonates in any case. Concerning adenosine A(2A), receptor, radioligand binding assays revealed that this receptor remains unaltered in maternal and neonatal brain in response to caffeine exposure. However, caffeine consumption during gestation and lactation evoked a significant decrease in mRNA level coding A(2A) receptor (32%) in mothers' brain. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Synthetic data were validated using clinical data combined with a bootstrap approach. Time-activity curves (TACs) of [C-11]MNPA were simulated, and the reliability of binding potential (BPND) and occupancy estimated by nonlinear least square (NLS) fitting and a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) were investigated for various noise levels and scan durations. In the human positron emission tomography (PET) study with and without antipsychotic, risperidone, the uncertainty of BPND and occupancy estimated by SRTM was investigated using resampled TACs based on bootstrap approach with weighted residual errors of fitting. For both NLS and SRTM, it was possible to have < 3% of bias in occupancy estimates of [C-11]MNPA by 60 mins. However, shortened scan duration degrades the quantification of very small binding potentials, especially in case of SRTM. Observations were replicated on the clinical data. Results showed that dopamine D-2 receptor occupancy by antipsychotics can be estimated precisely in region of interest analysis by SRTM with a longer than 60-min [C-11]MNPA PET scan duration.

Antidepressants Targeting the Serotonin Reuptake Transporter Act via a Competitive Mechanism	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							H-3 PAROXETINE BINDING; LOW-AFFINITY BINDING; IN-VITRO; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; NOREPINEPHRINE TRANSPORTER; TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN; PERMEATION PATHWAY; BACTERIAL HOMOLOG; S-CITALOPRAM; UPTAKE SITES	Although several antidepressants (including fluoxetine, imipramine, citalopram, venlafaxine, and duloxetine) are known to inhibit the serotonin transporter (SERT), whether or not these molecules compete with 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (5-HT) for binding to SERT has remained controversial. We have performed radioligand competition binding experiments and found that all data can be fitted via a simple competitive interaction model, using Cheng-Prusoff analysis (Biochem Pharmacol 22:3099-3108, 1973). Two different SERT-selective radioligands, [H-3]N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio)-benzylamine (DASB) and [H-3]S-citalopram, were used to probe competitive binding to recombinantly expressed human SERT or native SERT in rat cortical membranes. All the SERT inhibitors that we tested were able to inhibit [H-3] DASB and [H-3]S-citalopram binding in a concentration-dependent manner, with unity Hill coefficient. In accordance with the Cheng-Prusoff relationship for a competitive interaction, we observed that test compound concentrations associated with 50% maximal inhibition of radiotracer binding (IC50) increased linearly with increasing radioligand concentration for all ligands: 5-HT, S-citalopram, R-citalopram, paroxetine, clomipramine, fluvoxamine, imipramine venlafaxine, duloxetine, indatraline, cocaine, and 2-beta-carboxy-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane. The equilibrium dissociation constant of 5-HT and SERT inhibitors were also derived using Scatchard analysis of the data set, and they were found to be comparable with the data obtained using the Cheng-Prusoff relationship. Our studies establish a reference framework that will contribute to ongoing efforts to understand ligand binding modes at SERT by demonstrating that 5-HT and the SERT inhibitors tested bind to the serotonin transporter in a competitive manner.

For osmotic control, PAECs were exposed to 15 mM L-glucose. We measured nitric oxide release using the met-hemoglobin assay and assessed beta-adrenoceptor density and subtypes by radioligand binding. Furthermore, we determined intracellular NADH and NADPH using high-performance liquid chromatography. High D-glucose concentrations but not L-glucose led to significantly reduced basal and stimulated nitric oxide release. Chronic salbutamol treatment significantly antagonized the impairment of the nitric oxide response, which was inhibited by ICI 118,551 but not by metoprolol. The number of giant cells was significantly increased in hyperglycemia, which could be prevented by salbutamol. Binding of the radioligand (-)-[I-125] iodocyanopindolol revealed a total beta-adrenoceptor density of 29.8+/-3.7 (normoglycemic) and 30.3+/-3.6 (hyperglycemic) fmol/mg protein. Displacement by ICI 118,551 revealed beta-adrenoceptor subtype distribution with 30.3+/-4.4 (normoglycemic) and 29.1+/-3.8% beta(2)-adrenoceptors. NADH production increased in hyperglycemia, which was completely prevented by salbutamol. We conclude that hyperglycemia in PAEC induces endothelial dysfunction with impaired nitric oxide release and that this can be prevented by beta(2)-adrenoceptor stimulation.

The possibility that these effects are associated with changes in dopamine concentration in the nucleus accumbens or striatum was investigated. Male Wistar rats were place conditioned in a three compartment model to vehicle or drug (morphine 2.5 mg/ kg, cocaine 5 mg/kg, sertraline 5 mg/kg or paroxetine 15 mg/,kg) alternately for 8 days using a 30 min pre-treatment time. Control animals received saline only. Nucleus accumbens and striatal tissue were dissected 72 h after final drug dose, and the concentration of dopamine and its metabolites determined using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Striatal dopamine D1-like receptor density was also determined through radioligand binding. Significant place preference (P<0.05) was observed with morphine, cocaine and sertraline. Morphine treated subjects showed a significant decrease (P<0.05) in striatal dopamine concentration, whilst cocaine and sertraline treatment resulted in a significant increase in striatal dopamine levels. Nucleus accumbens concentrations of dopamine, and striatal dopamine D1-like receptor density remained unchanged. The changes in striatal dopamine concentrations are consistent with withdrawal from opioid and stimulant compounds, and suggest that place preference conditioning may, in part, result from negative motivational or aversive effects.

Here, we describe the characterisation of the binding properties of the tritiated radioanalogue of BIBN4096BS in SK-N-MC cells as well as in marmoset tissue. [H-3]BIBN4096BS showed reversible and saturable binding to SK-N-MC cells with a K-D of 0.045 nM. In competition experiments, [H-3]BIBN4096BS is concentration-dependently displaced from SK-N-MC cell membranes by BIBN4096BS as well as by the endogenous ligand CGRP and its analogues with the rank order of affinity BIBN4096BS > human alpha-CGRP = human beta-CGRP>[Cys(Et)(2.7)]human alpha-CGRP>adrenomedullin (high affinity site) = human alpha-CGRP-(8-37) = human beta-CGRP-(8-37)>calcitonin = amylin. In the marmoset cortex, saturable [H-3]BIBN4096BS binding was observed with a K-D of 0.077 nM. CGRP showed biphasic competition of [H-3]BIBN4096BS binding, whilst BIBN4096BS monophasically displaced its radioanalogue with a K-i of 0.099 nM. These data, using [H-3]BIBN4096BS, confirm the high affinity of this novel antagonist for the primate CGRP receptor and demonstrate furthermore that this radioligand is a useful tool to study CGRP receptor pharmacology, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Adenosine A(1) receptors, studied using [H-3]1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([H-3]DPCPX) as radioligand, showed the expected regional distribution in human brain. Addition of 500 mu M GTP significantly increased (23-55%) [H-3] DPCPX binding in all regions measured. In CHO cells transfected with human adenosine A(1) receptor cDNA, the number of receptors, B-max, increased from 401 (359-442) to 667 (592-743) fmol/mg protein upon addition of GTP. [H-3]5-Amino-7-(2- phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo- [4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo-[1,5-c]-pyrimidine ([H-3]SCH 58261), a selective adenosine A(2A) receptor ligand, showed saturable binding to membranes from CHO cells transfected with adenosine A(2A) receptor cDNA and was localized to striatum and globus pallidus in human brain sections. Addition of GTP did not significantly change [H-3]SCH 58261 binding to brain sections or CHO cell membranes. These results indicate that human A(1) and A(2A) receptors are not substantially different from those of the rat as regards regulation by GTP and interactions with endogenous adenosine in binding experiments. However, the relative abundance of the receptors differs between species, and this may be related to the differences observed in the potency of the endogenous agonist. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Compared with previously described approaches, our novel MAOS method dramatically reduces overall reaction time without adversely effecting reaction yields. We envision that the described MAOS protocol may be suitably applied to high-throughput, diversity-oriented synthesis of novel compounds based on the pyrazolo-pyrimidinyl scaffold. Such an approach could accelerate the development of focused libraries of novel TSPO ligands with potential for future development as molecular imaging and therapeutic agents. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We aimed to validate the PET radioligand -[F-18]FE-PE2I as a clinical biomarker in PD, hypothesizing negative correlations between DAT availability in specified nigrostriatal regions with symptom duration, disease stage and motor symptom scores. Methods We included 41 PD patients (age 45-79 years; H&Y stage < 3) and 37 healthy control subjects in a cross-sectional study with dynamic -[F-18]FE-PE2I PET. Binding potential -(BPND) was estimated in the caudate nucleus, putamen, ventral striatum, sensorimotor striatum, and substantia nigra using the cerebellum as reference region. Results We found negative correlations (p < 0.02) between symptom duration and -BPND in the putamen and sensorimotor striatum ((s)(r) = -.42; rs = -.51), and between H&Y stage and -BPND in caudate nucleus, putamen, sensorimotor striatum, and substantia nigra (r(s) between -.40 and -.54). The first correlations were better described with exponential fitting. MDS-UPDRS-III in `OFF' state correlated negatively (p < 0.04) with -BPND in the sensorimotor striatum (r(s) = -.47), and excluding tremor score also in the putamen (r(s) = -.45). Conclusion Results are in agreement with earlier findings in in vivo and post-mortem studies and validate -[F-18]FEPE2I as a functional PD biomarker for PD severity.

Methods: D2/3R binding was determined in anaesthetized animals with small animal SPECT in baseline and after challenge with AMA (10 or 40 mg/kg) using [I-123]IBZM as radioligand. Immediately post-challenge and prior to radioligand administration, motor/exploratory behaviors were assessed for 30 min in an open field. Each rat underwent measurements with a dedicated small animal MRI in order to gain anatomical information. Regions of interest were defined on SPECT-MRI overlays. The regional binding potentials in baseline and post-challenge were estimated by computing ratios of the specifically bound compartments to the cerebellar reference region. Results: 40 mg/kg AMA reduced D2/3R binding in nucleus accumbens, caudateputamen and thalamus, while 10 mg/kg decreased D2/3R binding in the anterodorsal hippocampus. The higher dose decreased ambulatory activity, rearing and grooming, but elevated sitting and head-shoulder motility relative to both vehicle and the lower dose in the first 15 min post-challenge. Conclusions: Results showed reductions of D2/3R binding in regions of the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic system after challenge with AMA, which reflect an increased availability of dopamine. Thereby, an inverse relationship between nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine and motor/exploratory activity can be inferred. Findings may be relevant for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease or schizophrenia, which are characterized by both dopaminergic and glutamatergic dysfunction.

We recently reported two potent F-18-labeled PDE10A radioligands (F-18-TZ19106B and F-18-TZ8110); initial evaluation in rats and nonhuman primates indicated stable metabolic profiles and excellent target-to-nontarget ratio (striatum/cerebellum) for both tracers. Herein, we focused on in vivo characterization of F-18-TZ19106B and F-18-TZ8110 to identify a suitable radioligand for imaging PDE10A in vivo. We directly compared microPET studies of these two radiotracers in adult male Macaca fascicularis nonhuman primates (NHPs). F-18-TZ19106B had higher striatal uptake and tracer retention in NHP brains than F-18-TZ8110, quantified by either standardized uptake values (SUVs) or nondisplaceable binding potential (BP (ND) ) estimated using reference-based modeling analysis. Blocking and displacement studies using the PDE10A inhibitor MP-10 indicated the binding of F-18-TZ19106B to PDE10A was specific and reversible. We also demonstrated sensitivity of F-18-TZ19106B binding to varying number of specific binding sites using escalating doses of MP-10 blockade (0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/kg). Pretreatment with a dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist enhanced the striatal uptake of F-18-TZ19106B. Our results indicate that F-18-TZ19106B is a promising radioligand candidate for imaging PDE10A in vivo and it may be used to determine target engagement of PDE10A inhibitors and serve as a tool to evaluate the effect of novel antipsychotic therapies.

TRPV1 expression has been demonstrated in diverse tissues and an essential role for TRPV1 in various disorders has been suggested. A TRPV1-specific PET-radioligand can serve as a useful tool for further in vivo research in animals and directly in humans. In this study, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a carbon-11 labelled analogue of N-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-chlorocinnamide (SB366791) which was reported as a specific high-affinity antagonist for TRPV1. Methods: The new tracer was evaluated with respect to log D and biodistribution in control, pretreated and TRPV1(-/-) mice. The percentage of radiometabolites of [C-11]SB366791 was determined in mouse plasma and brain. Results: [C-11] SB366791 was obtained in good yield (69%+/- 11%: isolated amoums 3034-5032 MBq) and high specific activity (390 +/- 215GBq/mu mol). The tracer was efficiently cleared from blood and all major organs via hepatobiliary and renal pathways. Initial brain uptake was high (1.6% ID) and wash-out from brain was rapid. The retention of [C-11] SB366791 in the trigeminal nerve of control mice was prominent. The in vitro binding affinity of SB366791 was determined to be 280 +/- 56 nM and 780 +/- 140 nM for human and rat TRPV1, respectively. Conclusions: [C-11] SB366791 has favourable biodistribution characteristics in mice. However the obtained low binding affinity for TRPV1 may not be sufficient to use the current compound as PET tracer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo profiles of AE9C90CB for action in bladder over salivary gland and compare it with four agents already in clinical use (tolterodine, oxybutynin, solifenacin and darifenacin). Experimental approach: Radioligand binding assay and isolated tissue-based functional assay were used to evaluate affinity, potency, and receptor subtype selectivity of compounds. Inhibition of carbachol-induced increase in intravesicular pressure and salivary secretion were measured in anaesthetized rabbits to assess the functional selectivity. Key results: In vitro radioligand binding study using human recombinant muscarinic receptors showed that AE9C90CB had greater affinity for M-3 muscarinic receptors with pKi of 9.90 +/- 0.11 and was 20-fold more selective for M-3 than for M-2 muscarinic receptors. AE9C90CB exhibited an unsurmountable antagonism on rat bladder strips (pK(B), 9.13 +/- 0.12). In anaesthetized rabbits after intravenous administration, AE9C90CB dose dependently inhibited carbachol-induced increase in intravesicular pressure and salivary secretion, and exhibited functional selectivity for urinary bladder over salivary gland which was ninefold better than that of oxybutynin. Conclusions and implications: We have identified AE9C90CB, a compound exhibiting moderate selectivity for M-3 over M-2 receptors but greater selectivity for urinary bladder over salivary gland than oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin and darifenacin. Therefore, AE9C90CB may be a promising compound for the treatment of overactive bladder with reduced potential to cause dry mouth than currently available antimuscarinic drugs.

Activation of distinct P2Y receptor subtypes stimulates insulin secretion in MIN6 mouse pancreatic β cells	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nucleotides; G protein-coupled receptors; Phospholipase C; Radioligand binding	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ALPHA-INDUCED APOPTOSIS; NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTORS; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONISTS; AGONISTS; MODULATION; RELEASE; ANALOGS; ISLETS	Extracellular nucleotides and their receptor antagonists have therapeutic potential in disorders such as inflammation, brain disorders, and cardiovascular diseases. Pancreatic beta cells express several purinergic receptors, and reported nucleotide effects on insulin secretion are contradictory. We studied the effect of P2Y receptors on insulin secretion and cell death in MIN6, mouse pancreatic beta cells. Expression of P2Y(1) and P2Y(6) receptors was revealed by total mRNA analysis using RT-PCR. MIN6 cells were stimulated in the presence of 16.7 mM glucose with or without P2Y(1) and P2Y(6) agonists, 2-MeSADP and UPA respectively. Both the agonists increased insulin secretion with EC50 values of 44.6 +/- 7.0 nM and 30.7 +/- 12.7 nM respectively. The insulin secretion by P2Y(1) and P2Y(6) agonists was blocked by their selective antagonists MRS2179 and MRS2578, respectively. Binding of the selective P2Y(1) receptor antagonist radioligand [I-125]MRS2500 in MIN6 cell membranes was saturable (K-D 4.74 +/- 0.47 nM), and known P2Y, ligands competed with high affinities. Inflammation and glucose toxicity lead to pancreatic beta cell death in diabetes. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that Up(3)U but not 2-MeSADP protected MIN6 cells against TNF-alpha induced apoptosis. Overall, the results demonstrate that selective stimulation of P2Y(1) and P2Y(6) receptors increases insulin secretion that accompanies intracellular calcium release, suggesting potential application of P2Y receptor ligands in the treatment of diabetes.

In the present work, we detected and characterized GADA in 72 sera from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and 14 sera from adult-onset diabetes patients using analytical systems in which GAD65 is expressed in a cellular context: confocal indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and electron microscopy after immunogold labeling on monolayers of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of metabolically labeled GAD65. Eighteen serum samples, 16 from type 1 diabetes patients and two from adult-onset diabetes patients, were positive by confocal IIF but scored negative by RBA. All of these 18 sera immunoprecipitated a 65kDa protein, supporting the existence of the GADA marker in such patients. It may be concluded that GADA negativity by the conventional RBA method using the soluble antigen, as well as negativity for other common markers measured by similar methods, is not enough to rule out the existence of the specific autoimmune component in childhood or adult-onset diabetes. Other analytical methods based in a more physiological presentation of the autoantigen structure, as confocal IIF and IP, bring an extra support to assess the complete repertoire of specific autoantibodies to native-like and membrane-bound, or denatured, -cell antigens.

Eighteen drug-naive patients with schizophrenia and seventeen control subjects were examined. The D-2 binding potential (BP) in the putamen, the caudate and the thalamus was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model. The volume of regions of interest was controlled for by MRI. Symptoms were rated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for Schizophrenia (PANSS). No significant group differences were found for D-2 BP in the putamen or in the caudate and there was no significant hemispheric difference for any region. In the right thalamus the D-2 BP was significantly lower in patients as compared to control subjects, whereas a numerical difference did not reach statistical significance for the left thalamus. There was no significant correlation between D-2 BP and total PANSS score in any region. There was a highly significant age effect in the caudate and in the putamen, but not in the thalamus. In this relatively large PET study of exclusively drug-naive schizophrenic patients, a lower D-2 BP in the right thalamus was found in the patient group. This finding is in agreement with two previous studies in Sweden and in Japan using the high-affinity radioligand [C-11]FLB 457 and provide further support for a role of dopamine in the thalamus related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

The use of high resolution phosphorimaging in all regions indicated the displacement of [H-3]flumazenil by clonazepam was monophasic with K-i values ranging from 2.73+/-0.17 to 6.49+/-0.21 nM. [H-3]flumazenil binding that was not displaced by clonazepam ranged from 3.39+/-0.86 to 7.15+/-1.11%. The ability of zolpidem to displace [H-3]flumazenil was also monophasic in the frontal cortex and cerebellum with K, values of 37.53+/-1.79 and 31.80+/-1.68 nM, respectively. In contrast, within all hippocampal regions, zolpidem displacement of [H-3]flumazenil was biphasic, with Ki values for the high affinity site ranging from 0.13+/-0.04 to 0.54+/-0.03 nM, whereas the low affinity site was between 84.98+/-1.58 and 98.84+/-1.89 nM. In addition, zolpidem insensitive [H-3]flumazenil binding was observed to vary markedly between brain regions, ranging between 37.85+/-1.60 and 6.13+/-0.83%. In conclusion, the present results indicate that in situ radioligand binding and high-resolution phosphorimaging techniques can be utilized to measure the differential displacement of [H-3]flumazenil by zolpidem and clonazepam. Moreover, our data suggests that the differential distribution of the zolpidem insensitive component of [H-3]flumazenil binding is an indicator of GABA/BZ receptors assembled by different subunits within the human brain.

Regional brain distribution studies were done in male C57BL/6 mice using simultaneous injections of d-threo-[H-3]methylphenidate (DAT) and (+)-alpha-[C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine (VMAT2). Single (55 mg/kg i.p.) or multiple (4 x 10 mg/kg i.p., I-hour intervals) administration of MPTP caused significant reductions in [3H]methylphenidate and [C-11] dihydrotetrabenazine specific striatal binding, measured 14 days later. The single high dose of MPTP produced greater losses of [C-11]dihydrotetrabenazine binding than did the multiple MPTP dosing regimen. Using the single high dose of R MPTP, changes of in vivo binding of the two radioligands were determined at 1, 3, and 14 days after neurotoxin injection. At 1 day, there are large losses of [H-3] methylphenidate binding (DAT) but no changes in [C-11] dihydrotetrabenazine binding to the VMAT2 site in the striatum. At 3 and 14 days, there were >50% losses of binding of both bot radioligands, but significantly (P < 0.001) greater losses of VMAT2 binding of [11C]dihydrotetrabenazine. These studies indicate that the losses of the neuronal membrane and vesicular transporters are not always equal, and do not occur in the same time frame? after administration of the neurotoxin MPTP.

In particular, the modified amino-terminal fragment analog, I-125-[Aib(1,3), Nle(8), Gln(10), homoarginine(11), Ala(12), Trp(14), Tyr(15)] rPTH(1 - 15) NH2, I-125-[Aib(1,3), M] PTH(1 - 15), was used as a radioligand that we hypothesized to bind solely to the juxtamembrane (J) portion of the PTHR containing the extracellular loops and transmembrane helices. We also employed I-125- PTH(1-34) as a radioligand that binds to both the amino-terminal extracellular (N) and J domains of the PTHR. Binding was examined in membranes derived from cells expressing either wild-type or mutant PTHRs. We found that the binding of I-125[ Aib(1,3), M] PTH(1 - 15) to the wild-type PTHR was strongly (similar to 90%) inhibited by guanosine 5'-O-(3-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S), whereas the binding of I-125- PTH( 1 - 34) was only mildly ( similar to 25%) inhibited by GTP gamma S. Of these two radioligands, only I-125[ Aib(1,3), M] PTH( 1 - 15) bound to PTHR-delNt, which lacks most of the receptor's N domain, and again this binding was strongly inhibited by GTP gamma S. Binding of I-125-[Aib(1,3), M] PTH(1 - 15) to the constitutively active receptor, PTHR-H223R, was only mildly ( similar to 20%) inhibited by GTP gamma S, as was the binding of I-125- PTH(1 - 34). In membranes prepared from cells lacking G alpha(s) via knockout mutation of Gnas, no binding of I-125-[Aib(1,3), M] PTH(1 - 15) was observed, but binding of I-125-[Aib(1,3), M] PTH( 1 - 15) was recovered by virally transducing the cells to heterologously express G alpha(s). I-125-PTH( 1 - 34) bound to the membranes with or without G alpha(s). The overall findings confirm the hypothesis that I-125-[ Aib(1,3), M] PTH( 1 - 15) binds solely to the J domain of the PTHR. They further show that this binding is strongly dependent on coupling of the receptor to G alpha(s)-containing heterotrimeric G proteins, whereas the binding of I-125- PTH( 1 - 34) can occur in the absence of such coupling. Thus, I-125-[ Aib(1,3), M] PTH( 1 - 15) appears to function as a selective probe of G alpha(s)-coupled, active-state PTHR conformations.

Unfortunately, the available anxiolytics are often ineffective, and most possess addictive potential. Thus, searching for novel compounds is essential. In our previous studies, we selected a multimodal compound, HBK-15, which showed a fast antidepressant-like effect in animal models of depression. HBK-15 demonstrated a high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A receptors and moderate for 5-HT7, dopamine D-2, and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Based on the receptor profile and preliminary studies, we aimed to investigate the anxiolytic potential of HBK-15 using the conditioned-response rat model of anxiety, i.e., the Vogel drinking test. We performed hot plate and free-drinking tests to exclude false positive results in the Vogel test. Using radioligand binding studies, we also investigated the affinity of the compound for the selected biological targets, which play a role in anxiety. Our experiments revealed that HBK-15 showed an anxiolytic-like effect in rats (5 mg/kg) without influencing the pain threshold or the amount of water consumed in the free-drinking test. Furthermore, the tested compound did not show a significant affinity for the selected biological targets, which suggests that its anxiolytic-like mechanism of action could be connected with the interaction with other receptors. This study indicates that multimodal compounds with a receptor profile similar to HBK-15 could be an attractive therapeutic option for patients with a generalized anxiety disorder. However, more studies are required to determine the exact mechanism of action of HBK-15 and its safety profile.

The aim of this study was to prepare a small molecular ligand p-SCN-Bn-TCMC-PSMA (NG001) and compare it with the commonly used DOTA-based PSMA-617. The PSMA-targeting ability of the Pb-212-labelled ligands was evaluated using PSMA-positive C4-2 human prostate cancer cells. Lead-212 is an in vivo generator of alpha particles by its daughter nuclides Bi-212 and Po-212. NG001 was synthesized by conjugating the isothiocyanato group of p-SCN-Bn-TCMC to the amino group of a glutamate-urea-based PSMA-binding entity. Molecular size, chelator unit and chelator linking method are different in NG001 and PSMA-617. Both ligands were efficiently labelled with Pb-212 using a Ra-224/Pb-212-solution generator in transient equilibrium with progeny. Lead-212-labelled NG001 was purified with a yield of 85.9 +/- 4.7% and with 0.7 +/- 0.2% of Ra-224. Compared with [Pb-212]Pb-PSMA-617, [Pb-212]Pb-NG001 displayed a similar binding and internalization in C4-2 cells, with comparable tumour uptake in mice bearing C4-2 tumours, but almost a 2.5-fold lower kidney uptake. Due to the rapid normal tissue clearance and tumour cell internalization, any significant translocalization of Bi-212 was not detected in mice. In conclusion, the obtained results warrant further preclinical studies to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of [Pb-212]Pb-NG001.

Species-specific susceptibility to cannabis-induced convulsions	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th European Workshop on Cannabinoid Research	SEP, 2017	Roehampton, ENGLAND				ANIMAL-MODELS; EPILEPSY; PHARMACOLOGY; SEIZURES; DELTA(9)-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; PHARMACOKINETICS; PUBLICATION; RAT	Background and PurposeNumerous claims are made for cannabis' therapeutic utility upon human seizures, but concerns persist about risks. A potential confounder is the presence of both (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), variously reported to be pro- and anticonvulsant, and cannabidiol (CBD), widely confirmed as anticonvulsant. Therefore, we investigated effects of prolonged exposure to different THC/CBD cannabis extracts on seizure activity and associated measures of endocannabinoid (eCB) system signalling. Experimental ApproachCannabis extract effects on in vivo neurological and behavioural responses, and on bioanalyte levels, were measured in rats and dogs. Extract effects on seizure activity were measured using electroencephalography telemetry in rats. eCB signalling was also investigated using radioligand binding in cannabis extract-treated rats and treatment-naive rat, mouse, chicken, dog and human tissue. Key ResultsProlonged exposure to cannabis extracts caused spontaneous, generalized seizures, subserved by epileptiform discharges in rats, but not dogs, and produced higher THC, but lower 11-hydroxy-THC (11-OH-THC) and CBD, plasma concentrations in rats versus dogs. In the same rats, prolonged exposure to cannabis also impaired cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1 receptor)-mediated signalling. Profiling CB1 receptor expression, basal activity, extent of activation and sensitivity to THC suggested interspecies differences in eCB signalling, being more pronounced in a species that exhibited cannabis extract-induced seizures (rat) than one that did not (dog). Conclusions and ImplicationsSustained cannabis extract treatment caused differential seizure, behavioural and bioanalyte levels between rats and dogs. Supporting radioligand binding data suggest species differences in eCB signalling. Interspecies variations may have important implications for predicting cannabis-induced convulsions from animal models.

Using PET and [C-11]vinpocetine, we measured the regional changes of TSPO in the brain of nine ischaemic stroke patients up to 14 weeks after the insult. Already a week after stroke there was an increased radioligand uptake, indicating the up-regulation of TSPO and the presence of activated microglia, in both the ischaemic core and the pen-infarct zone. This increased activation showed a steady decrease with post stroke time. The proportion between %SUV values in the pen-infarct zone and the ischaemic core increased with time. There were no time-dependent TSPO activity changes in other regions, not affected directly by the stroke. The present observations demonstrate that increased regional microglia activation, as a consequence of stroke, can be visualised with PET, using the TSPO molecular imaging biomarker [C-11]vinpocetine. The evolution of this microglial activation shows a time dependent decrease the gradient of which is different between the pen-infarct zone and the ischaemic core. The findings indicate an increased microglial activation in the pen-stroke region for several weeks after the insult. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Xanthines are one of the most important classes of adenosine receptor antagonists and have been widely developed in terms of affinity and selectivity for adenosine receptors. We recently developed new original pathways for the synthesis of xanthine analogues starting from 5-substituted-2-amino-2-oxazoline 5 as a synthon. These procedures allowed us to selectively introduce a large, functionalized and P-adrenergic 2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl pharmacophore at the 1- and 3-position of the xanthine moiety which allowed further structural modifications. In this study, we present a new synthetic access to racemic xanthine derivatives 1-4 from 5, and their evaluation as adenosine A(1), A(2A) and A(3) receptor ligands in radioligand binding studies. The 2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl moiety was well tolerated in the 3-position of the xanthine core, while its introduction in the 1-position of the xanthine moiety led to a large decrease in adenosine receptor affinity. 1,7-Dimethyl-3-[1-(2-chloro-3-phenoxypropyl)]-8-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)xanthine (2n) was the most potent and selective A(2A) antagonist of the present series (K-i = 44 nM, >> 200-fold selective vs A(1)). 1-Propyl-3-[1-(2-hydroxy-3-phenoxypropyl)]-8-noradamantylxanthine (3f) was identified as a potent (K(i)A(1) = 21 nM) and highly selective >> 350-fold vs A(2A) and A(3) receptor) adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist.

Traditionally, the analysis of brain receptor studies has been based on observer-dependent manual region of interest definitions and visual interpretation. Our aim was to create a template for automated image registrations and volume of interest (VOI) quantifications and to show that an automated quantification method of I-123-ADAM is more repeatable than the manual method. Patients, methods: A template and a predefined VOI map was created from I-123-ADAM scans done for healthy volunteers (n = 15). Scans of another group of healthy persons (HS, n = 12) and patients with bulimia nervosa (BN, n = 10) were automatically fitted to the template and specific binding ratios (SBRs) were calculated by using the VOI map. Manual VOI definitions were done for the HS and BN groups by both one and two observers. The repeatability of the automated method was evaluated by using the BN group. Results: For the manual method, the interobserver coefficient of repeatability was 0.61 for the HS group and 1.00 for the BN group. The intra observer coefficient of repeatability for the BN group was 0.70. For the automated method, the coefficient of repeatability was 0.13 for SBRs in midbrain. Conclusion: An automated quantification gives valuable information in addition to visual interpretation decreasing also the total image handling time and giving clear advantages for research work. An automated method for analysing I-123-ADAM binding to the brain SERT gives repeatable results for fitting the studies to the template and for calculating SBRs. and could therefore replace manual methods.

However, it has not been possible to measure the burden of SPs or assess the effect of potential therapies on brain Abeta levels in patients. Toward that end, we have developed a novel radioligand, [I-125]TZDM, which binds Abeta fibrils with high affinity, crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and labels amyloid plaques in vivo. Compared to a styrylbenzene probe, [I-125]IMSB, [I-125]TZDM showed a 10-fold greater brain penetration and labeled plaques with higher sensitivity for in vivo imaging. However, this ligand also labels white matter, which contributes to undesirable high background regions of the brain. Interestingly, parallel to their differential binding characteristics onto fibrils composed of 40 (Abeta40)- or 42 (Abeta42)-amino-acid-long forms of Abeta peptides, these radioligands displayed differential labeling of SPs in AD brain sections under our experimental conditions. It was observed that [I-125]IMSB labeled SPs containing Abeta40, amyloid angiopathy (AA), and neurofibrillary tangles, whereas [I-125]TZDM detected only SPs and Abeta42-positive AA. Since increased production and deposition of Abeta42 relative to Abeta40 may be crucial for the generation of SPs, [I-125]TZDM and related derivatives may be more attractive probes for in vivo plaque labeling. Further structural modifications of TZDM to lower the background labeling will be needed to optimize the plaque-labeling property.

In rodents, clozapine (0.1 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg) competed with F-18-fallypride at all the doses administered. At doses over 40 mg/kg, clozapine was able to displace all the administered F-18-fallypride, A pseudobiphasic profile of receptor occupancy by clozapine was observed. This behavior was compared with such other neuroleptics as risperidone and haloperidol that exhibited over 90% receptor occupancy at doses over 0.1 mg/kg and did not exhibit a biphasic nature. Dopamine D-2 receptor occupancy in the monkeys was studied using positron emission tomography (PET) after acute subcutaneous doses of the various drugs. At therapeutically relevant doses, clozapine, risperidone, and haloperidol were able to compete significantly with the binding of F-18-fallypride in all brain regions in rhesus monkeys, and our analyses indicate that these drugs (clozapine, risperidone, and haloperidol) do not discriminate between the striatal (caudate and putamen) and the extrastriatal (thalamus and cortical regions) dopamine receptors. The following extent of D-2 receptor occupancies were measured in the monkey brain using PET: clozapine approximate to 70% (dose of 9.7 mg/kg), risperidone approximate to 75% (0.05 mg/kg), and haloperidol approximate to 90% (0.05 mg/kg).

J	Sum, CS; Pyo, N; Wells, JW				Sum, CS; Pyo, N; Wells, JW			Apparent capacity of cardiac muscarinic receptors for different radiolabeled antagonists	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						binding parameters; radioligands; muscarinic receptors; artifacts	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS; G-PROTEIN; BINDING-PROPERTIES; MULTIPLE STATES; HIGH-AFFINITY; M2 RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; PHOSPHOINOSITIDE HYDROLYSIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX	Muscarinic receptors in sarcolemmal membranes, digitonin-solubilized extracts, and purified preparations from porcine atria have revealed a shortfall in the apparent capacity for N-[H-3]methylscopolamine, which was only about 75% of that for [H-3]quinuclidinylbenzilate. Since binding at near-saturating concentrations of [H-3]quinuelidinylbenzilate was inhibited fully at comparatively low concentrations of unlabeled N-methylseopolamine, the data are inconsistent with the notion that [3H]quinuclidinylbenzilate binds selectively to a subclass of distinct, non-interconverting, and mutually independent sites. The discrepancy is resolved by adjusting the specific activity of N-[H-3] methylscopolamine to account for unlabeled scopolamine that was identified in some batches of the radioligand. Also, there was no shortfall in capacity when N-[3H]methylscopolamine was devoid of scopolamine, and the predicted effect was obtained when pure N-[H-3]methylscopolarnine was supplemented with known amounts of scopolamine. A small discrepancy in the levels of scopolamine estimated pharmacologically and by mass spectrometry can be attributed largely to a difference in the efficiency of ionization between scopolamine and N-methylseopolamine. Different capacities for different radioligands are not uncommon with muscarinic and other G protein-coupled receptors, and in some cases the effect may have been due wholly or in part to an unlabeled impurity. Binding data can be mechanistically ambiguous, particularly when acquired only at graded concentrations of the radioligand. The predicted effects of an unlabeled impurity mimic or resemble those of alternative scenarios such as sequestration behind a hydrophobic barrier, a nucleotide-regulated interconversion from one state of affinity to another, and cooperativity between interacting sites.

The hCRF(2 alpha) and xCRF(2) receptors bound all four radioligands with different affinities, whereas hCRF(1) did not bind I-125-aSVG, and xCRF(1) bound neither I-125-sauvagine nor I-125-aSVG. Competitive binding studies using unlabeled agonists and antagonists with hCRF(1) and hCRF(2 alpha) receptors revealed that most agonists exhibited higher affinity in displacing agonist radioligands compared with displacement of antagonist radioligands. Exceptions were the agonists human and rat urocortin, which displayed high-affinity binding in the presence of either I-125-labeled agonist or antagonist ligands. In contrast, the affinities of antagonists were independent of the nature of the radioligand. We also found that, in contrast to the mammalian CRF receptors, the affinity of ligand binding to xCRF(1) and xCRF(2) receptors strongly depended on the nature of the radioligand used for competition. For xCRF(1), competitors showed different rank order binding profiles with I-125-CRF compared with I-125-AST as the displaceable ligand. Similarly, binding of competitors to the xCRF(2) receptor showed markedly different profiles with I-125-CRF as the competed ligand compared with the other radioligands. These data demonstrate that amphibian CRF receptors have distinctly different binding modes compared with their mammalian counterparts.

Epilepsy in this population is mostly associated with calcified granulomas; at the time of seizure recurrence, on MRI, about a half of calcified granulomas demonstrate transient surrounding edema called perilesional edema. Surgically removed calcified granulomas associated with perilesional edema and seizures demonstrated significant inflammation with infiltration of macrophages, microglia, and activated astrocytes [47]. Therefore, perilesional edema is a result of host immunoreactions directed against parasite antigens. The host immunoreactions are detected by imaging TSPO.											47	0	0	0	2	SPRINGER-VERLAG SINGAPORE PTE LTD	SINGAPORE	152 BEACH ROAD, #21-01/04 GATEWAY EAST, SINGAPORE, 189721, SINGAPORE			978-981-15-0810-3; 978-981-15-0809-7				2020							226	228				10.1007/978-981-15-0810-3		3	Immunology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging	Book Citation Index – Science (BKCI-S)	Immunology; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging	BR4ZU		Green Submitted			2024-02-16	WOS:000653975100078

We therefore sought to evaluate the clinical outcome of this therapy in such a cohort. Methods Of all prostate cancer patients admitted to our department between September 2015 and March 2019 to receive 1-4 courses of PSMA-RLT (each course consisted of three cycles of highly standardized PSMA-RLT every 4 weeks), only 10 consecutive men were found to have nodal metastases only and were analyzed retrospectively. Results Nine out of 10 patients responded to their first PSMA-RLT course with a mean prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline of 71.8 +/- 25.2%, seven of them demonstrated a PSA decline of >= 50%. Collectively, seven of eight patients responded to further PSMA-RLT courses with a total PSA reduction of 59.8 +/- 30.0%, five of which showed a PSA reduction of >= 50%. One patient experienced complete remission. Median progression-free survival was 85 weeks (range 14-255 weeks) and median overall survival was not reached during the median observation time of 209 weeks (30-298 weeks). Univariate Cox-regression identified initial PSA decline as the only predictive parameter for progression-free survival (P = 0.047). Conclusion mCRPC patients with only lymph node metastases showed favorable survival and excellent response to PSMA-RLT, leading to transient partial remission of the disease in most of them.

Their alterations are perhaps associated with a pro-inflammatory state. The TgF344-AD rat strain has been designed to express human APP and human PS1 Delta E9 genes, encoding for amyloid proteins A beta-40 and A beta-42 and displays amyloid pathology and cognitive deficits with aging. The TgF344-AD rat model is used in this study to evaluate the cellular origin of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO, a marker of glial cell activation) binding, and the 5HT2A-receptor (5HT2AR) serotonin receptor levels that are possibly disrupted in AD. The technique presented here is Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting to Radioligand Treated Tissue (FACS-RTT), a quantitative cell-type-specific technique complementary to in vivo PET or SPECT or ex vivo/in vitro autoradiography techniques. It quantifies the same radiolabeled tracer used prior for imaging, using a gamma counter after cytometry cell sorting. This allows determining the cellular origin of the radiolabeled protein with high cellular specificity and sensitivity. For example, studies with FACS-RTT showed that (i) the increase in TSPO binding was associated with microglia in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, (ii) an increase in TSPO binding at 12-and 18-months was associated with astrocytes first, and then microglia in the TgF344-AD rats compared to wild type (WT) rats, and (iii) the striatal density of 5HT2AR decreases in astrocytes at 18 months in the same rat AD model. Interestingly, this technique can be extended to virtually all radiotracers.

The binding of [H-3]muscimol has been used to evaluate the distribution of GABA(A) receptors in the brain, and studies of modulation of [H-3]muscimol binding by allosteric GABAergic modulators such as barbiturates and steroid anesthetics have provided insight into the modes of action of these drugs on the GABA(A) receptor. It has, however, not been feasible to directly apply interaction parameters derived from functional studies to describe the binding of muscimol to the receptor. Here, we employed the Monod-Wyman-Changeux concerted transition model to analyze muscimol binding isotherms. We show that the binding isotherms from recombinant alpha 1 beta 3 GABA(A) receptors can be qualitatively predicted using electrophysiological data pertaining to properties of receptor activation and desensitization in the presence of muscimol. The model predicts enhancement of [H-3]muscimol binding in the presence of the steroids allopregnanolone and pregnenolone sulfate, although the steroids interact with distinct sites and either enhance (allopregnanolone) or reduce (pregnenolone sulfate) receptor function. We infer that the concerted transition model can be used to link radioligand binding and electrophysiological data. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The study employs a three-state resting-active-desensitized model to link radioligand binding and electrophysiological data. We show that the binding isotherms can be qualitatively predicted using parameters estimated in electrophysiological experiments and that the model accurately predicts the enhancement of [H-3]muscimol binding in the presence of the potentiating steroid allopregnanolone and the inhibitory steroid pregnenolone sulfate.

Modulation of endothelin receptors in the failing right ventricle of the heart and vasculature of the lung in human pulmonary arterial hypertension	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Endothelin; FR139317; Radioligand binding; Affinity constant; Receptor density	CLINICAL-TRIALS; ANTAGONISTS; FAILURE; DISEASE; PRESSURE; FR139317; BOSENTAN; IMPROVE; BINDING; HEALTH	Aims: In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), increases in endothelin-1 (ET-1) contribute to elevated pulmonary vascular resistance which ultimately causes death by right ventricular (RV) heart failure. ET antagonists are effective in treating PAH but lack efficacy in treating left ventricular (LV) heart failure, where ETA receptors are significantly increased. The aim was to quantify the density of ETA and ETB receptors in cardiopulmonary tissue from PAH patients and the monocrotaline (MCT) rat, which recapitulates some of the pathophysiological features, including increased RV pressure. Main methods: Radioligand binding assays were used to quantify affinity, density and ratio of ET receptors. Key findings: In RV from human PAH hearts, there was a significant increase in the ratio of ETA to ETB receptors compared with normal hearts. In the RV of the MCT rat, the ratio also changed but was reversed. In both human and rat, there was no change in LV. In human PAH lungs, ETA receptors were significantly increased in the medial layer of small pulmonary arteries with no change detectable in MCT rat vessels. Significance: Current treatments for PAH focus mainly on pulmonary vasodilatation. The increase in ETA receptors in arteries provides a mechanism for the beneficial vasodilator actions of ET antagonists. The increase in the ratio of ETA in RV also implicates changes to ET signalling although it is unclear if ET antagonism is beneficial but the results emphasise the unexploited potential for therapies that target the RV, to improve survival in patients with PAH.

Kinetic modeling of the serotonin 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]P943 in humans	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						brain; evaluation of new radiotracers; 5-HT1B serotonin receptors; human; positron emission tomography (PET); tracer kinetic modeling	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; RAT-BRAIN; DISTRIBUTION VOLUME; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; PET; BINDING	[C-11]P943 is a new radioligand recently developed to image and quantify serotonin 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1B) receptors with positron emission tomography (PET). The purpose of this study was to evaluate [C-11]P943 for this application in humans, and to determine the most suitable quantification method. Positron emission tomography data and arterial input function measurements were acquired in a cohort of 32 human subjects. Using arterial input functions, compartmental modeling, the Logan graphical analysis, and the multilinear method MA1 were tested. Both the two tissue-compartment model and MA1 provided good fits of the PET data and reliable distribution volume estimates. Using the cerebellum as a reference region, BPND binding potential estimates were computed. [C-11]P943 BPND estimates were significantly correlated with in vitro measurements of the density of 5-HT1B receptors, with highest values in the occipital cortex and pallidum. To evaluate noninvasive methods, two-and three-parameter graphical analyses, Simplified Reference Tissue Models (SRTM and SRTM2), and Multilinear Reference Tissue Models (MRTM and MRTM2) were tested. The MRTM2 model provided the best correlation with MA1 binding-potential estimates. Parametric images of the volume of distribution or binding potential of [C-11]P943 could be computed using both MA1 and MRTM2. The results show that [C-11]P943 provides quantitative measurements of 5-HT1B binding potential.

We have extended this study by measuring levels of CHRM1 ([H-3]pirenzepine binding), CHRM3 ([H-3]4-DAMP binding), the transcription factor SP1 and the CHRM1 downstream target beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in BA 6 from 19 subjects with schizophrenia and 19 control subjects. Radioligand binding was quantified using either in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography or, in cohorts of 10 control subjects and 10 subjects with schizophrenia, membrane enriched fraction (MEF) CNS ([H-3]pirenzepine binding only). Levels of SP1 and BACE1 were measured by Western blotting. [H-3]pirenzepine binding to tissue sections was in two layers, binding to tissue sections (Binding layer 1: p < 0.01; Binding layer 2: p<0.001) and MEF (p<0.05) were decreased in schizophrenia. Levels of [H-3]4-DAMP binding, SP1 and BACE1 were not altered in subjects with the disorder. This study shows a decrease in levels of CHRM1 in BA 6 from subjects with schizophrenia; as CHRM1 and BA 6 are important in maintaining normal cognitive function, these data support the hypothesis that decreased levels of cortical CHRM1 may contribute to the cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Our findings on BACE1 suggest that the schizophrenia phenotype reported in BACE(-/-) mice is not simply due to lack of that protein in the cortex. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In all insects, Scatchard analysis suggested two binding sites for imidacloprid with K-d values in the range of 1 nM and 10 nM, respectively. The Hill values were significantly below 1 (range of 0.63 to 0.85). In contrast to imidacloprid and nicotine, the potency of thiamethoxam to displace [3-H]-imidacloprid varied considerably among these insects. Thiamethoxam was more active than nicotine on Aphis receptors but 100-fold less in Locusta, a nontarget insect. Comparable relations were found to nithiazine. In Myzus, the inhibition curve for thiamethoxam was shallow. This suggested a heterogeneous receptor population displaying a range of binding affinities to thiamethoxam in this aphid. In all three insects, the other neonicotinoid insecticides studied competed with [3-H]-imidacloprid in the same order: thiacloprid > imidacloprid greater than or equal to acetamiprid > nitenpyram. N-Methylation of imidacloprid strongly reduced the affinity to the imidacloprid site, whereas N-demethylation of thiamethoxam resulted in a comparable increase of affinity. Supplementary assays were performed with (-)-[3-H]-nicotine and [3-H]-alpha-bungarotoxin on locust membranes. Overall, the data suggested that the outstanding insecticidal properties of thiamethoxam may be due to either a different binding site on nicotinic receptors, or receptor isoforms, or specific pharmakokinetic behavior, rather than to exceptional affinity to one of the examined binding sites.

Objective: To report the safety and activity of alpha-emitting Ac-225-PSMA-617 RLT in mCRPC that has progressed after Lu-177-PSMA. Design, setting, and participants: Twenty-six patients were treated under a compassionate use protocol. The eligibility criteria included previous treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, previous taxane-based chemotherapy, progression after Lu-177-PSMA, and positive PSMA-ligand uptake. The median number of previous mCRPC regimens was 6. Ac-225-PSMA-617 was given every 8 wk until progression/intolerable side effects. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline, PSA progression-free survival (PSA-PFS), clinical progression-free survival (cPFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity were measured. Results and limitations: Sixty-one cycles of Ac-225-PSMA-617 (median number of cycles 2; median activity 9 MBq) were administered. A PSA decline of >= 50% was achieved in 17/26 patients. The median PSA-PFS, cPFS, and OS periods were 3.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8-11.2), 4.1 (95% CI 3-14.8), and 7.7 (95% CI 4.5-12.1) mo, respectively. Liver metastases were associated with shorter PSA-PFS (median 1.9 vs 4.0 mo; p = 0.02), cPFS (median 1.8 vs 5.2 mo; p = 0.001), and OS (median 4.3 vs 10.4 mo; p = 0.01). Hematological grade 3/4 toxicities were anemia (35%), leucopenia (27%), and thrombocytopenia (19%). All patients experienced grade 1/2 xerostomia. Two and six patients stopped due to hematological toxicity and xerostomia, respectively. A limitation is the retrospective design. Conclusions: Ac-225-PSMA-617 showed measurable antitumor effect after Lu-177PSMA failure in late-stage mCRPC. Grade 3/4 hematological side effects were observed in up to one-third of patients, and xerostomia led to treatment halt in a relevant number of patients. Patient summary: Ac-225-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617 therapy showed substantial antitumor effect in late metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer after Lu-177-PSMA failure. However, dry mouth is a common side effect that caused about a quarter of patients to stop therapy. (C) 2020 European Association of Urology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Alpha Synuclein Fibrils Contain Multiple Binding Sites for Small Molecules	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Alpha synuclein; Lewy bodies; Lewy neurites; Parkinson's disease	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TAU; INCLUSIONS; DESIGN; BETA	The fibrillary aggregation of the protein alpha synuclein (Asyn) is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease, and the identification of small molecule binding sites on fibrils is essential to the development of diagnostic imaging probes. A series of molecular modeling, photoaffinity labeling, mass spectrometry, and radioligand binding studies were conducted on Asyn fibrils. The results of these studies revealed the presence of three different binding sites within fibrillar Asyn capable of binding small molecules with moderate to high affinity. A knowledge of the amino acid residues in these binding sites will be important in the design of high affinity probes capable of imaging fibrillary species of Asyn.

[11C]Raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor radiotracer with rapid kinetics, can identify the direction of changes in the neurotransmitter dopamine, but quantitative interpretation of the relationship between dopamine levels and radiotracer binding has proven elusive. Agonist-induced receptor desensitization and internalization, a homeostatic mechanism to downregulate neurotransmitter-mediated function, can shift radioligand-receptor binding affinity and confound PET interpretations of receptor occupancy. In this study, we compared occupancies induced by amphetamine (AMP) in drug-naive wild-type (WT) and internalization-compromised beta-arrestin-2 knockout (KO) mice using a within-scan drug infusion to modulate the kinetics of [11C]raclopride. We additionally performed studies at 3 h following AMP pretreatment, with the hypothesis that receptor internalization should markedly attenuate occupancy on the second challenge, because dopamine cannot access internalized receptors. Without prior AMP treatment, WT mice exhibited somewhat larger binding potential than KO mice but similar AMP-induced occupancy. At 3 h after AMP treatment, WT mice exhibited binding potentials that were 15 % lower than KO mice. At this time point, occupancy was preserved in KO mice but suppressed by 60 % in WT animals, consistent with a model in which most receptors contributing to binding potential in WT animals were not functional. These results demonstrate that arrestinmediated receptor desensitization and internalization produce large effects in PET [11C]raclopride occupancy studies using agonist challenges.

Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients Treated with Androgen Deprivation Therapy: A Multimodality Functional Imaging Study to Evaluate Neuroinflammation	PROSTATE CANCER			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PROSTATE-CANCER; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; SEX-HORMONES; TSPO; ASSOCIATION; RISK; TESTOSTERONE; INDIVIDUALS; ACTIVATION	Background. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer is implicated as a possible cause of cognitive impairment (CI). CI in dementia and Alzheimer's disease is associated with neuroinflammation. In this study, we investigated a potential role of neuroinflammation in ADT-related CI. Methods. Patients with prostate cancer on ADT for >= 3 months were categorized as having ADT-emergent CI or normal cognition (NC) based on self-report at interview. Neuroinflammation was evaluated using positron emission tomography (PET) with the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [11C]-PBR28. [11C]-PBR28 uptake in various brain regions was quantified as standardized uptake value (SUVR, normalized to cerebellum) and related to blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI) choice-reaction time task (CRT) activation maps. Results. Eleven patients underwent PET: four with reported CI (rCI), six with reported NC (rNC), and one status unrecorded. PET did not reveal any between-group differences in SUVR regionally or globally. There was no difference between groups on brain activation to the CRT. Regardless of the reported cognitive status, there was strong correlation between PET-TSPO signal and CRT activation in the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial cortex. Conclusions. We found no difference in neuroinflammation measured by PET-TSPO between patients with rCI and rNC. However, we speculate that the strong correlation between TSPO uptake and BOLD-fMRI activation in brain regions involved in memory and known to have high androgen-receptor expression mediating plasticity (hippocampus and amygdala) might reflect inflammatory effects of ADT with compensatory upregulated/increased synaptic functions. Further studies of this imaging readout are warranted to investigate ADT-related CI.

Severe Thrombocytopenia in Patients With Advanced Neuroendocrine Tumor Treated With Peptide Receptor Radioligand Therapy	CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						neuroendocrine; tumor; PRRT; adverse; cytopenia	RADIOLABELED SOMATOSTATIN ANALOG; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; BONE METASTASES; PROGNOSTIC-FACTORS; SCINTIGRAPHY; PRRT; LU-177-DOTATATE; TOXICITY; SURVIVAL; LU-177-OCTREOTATE	BackgroundPeptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) was Food and Drug Administration approved in 2018 for the treatment of unresectable somatostatin receptor-positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and provides an important option for patients with advanced disease. A known adverse effect of this treatment is hematologic toxicity, although usually transient. We present 3 patients with metastatic gastroenteropancreatic NETs treated with PRRT who were evaluated for severe persistent thrombocytopenia.MethodsThree patients who commenced therapy with PRRT were known to proceed to a bone marrow (BM) biopsy for persistent severe thrombocytopenia and were included in this study. These patients were identified retrospectively and evaluated for their tumor properties, including immunohistochemical markers, treatment modalities, and clinical outcomes.ResultsAll 3 patients had metastatic NETs that progressed on prior lines of therapy and were treated with 1 to 4 doses of 177Lu-DOTATATE 7.4 GBq (200 mCi) before developing grade 3 (25,000 to 50,000/mu L) refractory thrombocytopenia. All patients had concurrent bone metastases, and 2 of the 3 had baseline grade 1 thrombocytopenia. In all 3 cases, BM biopsy documented widespread tumor infiltration.ConclusionsSevere refractory thrombocytopenia after PRRT is rare and may result from numerous known causes, including radiation-induced myelotoxicity, myelodysplastic syndrome, and tumor BM infiltration. We present 3 cases of thrombocytopenia related to persistent or progressive BM metastasis. Although known bone metastasis is not a contraindication to PRRT, thrombocytopenia may be a manifestation of tumor progression and should be considered when making decisions about continuation of therapy.

For the evaluation of PSMA expression levels, male NOD/SCID mice bearing prostate cancer (PCa) xenografts of C4-2 (PSMA+++), 22Rv1 (PSMA+) and PC-3 (PSMA-) were administered [F-18]AlF-PSMA-11 with a medium MA(app) (20.24 +/- 3.22 MBq/nmol). SUVmean and SUVmax values were respectively 3.22 and 3.17 times higher for the high versus low PSMA expressing tumors (p < 0.0001). To evaluate the effect of varying MA(app), C4-2 and 22Rv1 xenograft bearing mice underwent additional [F-18]AlF-PSMA-11 imaging with a high (211.2 +/- 38.9 MBq/nmol) and/or low MA(app) (1.92 +/- 0.27 MBq/nmol). SUV values showed a significantly increasing trend with higher MA(app). Significant changes were found for SUVmean and SUVmax between the high versus low MA(app) and medium versus low MA(app) (both p < 0.05), but not between the high versus medium MA(app) (p = 0.055 and 0.25, respectively). The effect of varying MA(app) was more pronounced in low expressing tumors and PSMA expressing tissues (e.g. salivary glands and kidneys). Overall, administration of a high MA(app) increases the detection of low expression tumors while also increasing uptake in PSMA expressing tissues, possibly leading to false positive findings. In radioligand therapy, a medium MA(app) could reduce radiation exposure to dose-limiting organs with only limited effect on radionuclide accumulation in the tumor.

Evaluation of [<SUP>68</SUP>Ga]Ga-PSMA PET/CT for therapy response assessment of [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy in metastasized castration refractory prostate cancer and correlation with survival	NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						prostate cancer; PSMA-targeted PET; PSMA radioligand therapy; therapy response assessment	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; EVALUATION CRITERIA; SOLID TUMORS; MDA CRITERIA; DOCETAXEL; RECIST; PSMA; MITOXANTRONE; LU-177-PSMA	Purpose The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the use of [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA PET/CT in therapy response assessment (TRA) of mCRPC patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and its correlation with overall survival (OS). Methods Thirty-nine patients were included in the study. Patient-/lesion-based early and late response assessment (ERA/LRA) was defined as PET2 (after two therapy cycles) vs. PET1 (before the first cycle) (n = 29) and end of treatment PET vs. PET1 (n = 17), respectively. PET-based response (PET parameters; modified (m) PERCIST/EORTC), biochemical response (Delta PSA; category-based) and category-based clinical response (CRA) was tested for correlation/agreement. PET-based TRA was correlated with OS. Results A significant correlation/agreement was shown between PET parameters and CRA as well as biochemical response in LRA of all lesions and between mPERCIST-based and category-based PSA response assessment in LRA (bone lesion-based, P = 0.045, kappa = 0.184). At ERA, OS was significantly higher in CR/PR/SD compared to progressive disease applying mPERCIST/EORTC criteria (P = 0.0024). Conclusion In [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617-treated mCRPC patients OS of the group of CR/PR/SD was significantly higher compared to the progressive disease group (mPERCIST/EORTC) in ERA. Therefore, [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA PET might serve as a complementary diagnostic tool for TRA offering prognostic value regarding OS.

The experience of pain is not only modulated by the individual's threshold to painful stimuli but also a product of the person's affective contributions, such as fear, anxiety, and previous experiences. Perhaps then to quantify pain is to examine the degree of nociception and pro-nociceptive inflammation, that is, the extent of cellular, chemical, and molecular changes that occur in pain-generating processes. Measuring changes in the local density of receptors, ion channels, mediators, and inflammatory/immune cells that are involved in the painful phenotype using targeted, highly sensitive, and specific positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers is therefore a promising approach toward objectively identifying peripheral pain generators. Although several preclinical radiotracer candidates are being developed, a growing number of ongoing clinical PET imaging approaches can measure the degree of target concentration and thus serve as a readout for sites of pain generation. Further, when PET is combined with the spatial and contrast resolution afforded by magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine physicians and radiologists can potentially identify pain drivers with greater accuracy and confidence. Clinical PET imaging approaches with fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose, fluorine-18 sodium fluoride, and sigma-1 receptor PET radioligand and translocator protein radioligands to isolate the source of pain are described here.

Diphenyl sulfide compounds are promising PET and SPECT radioligands for in vivo quantification of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and it is therefore important to investigate their radiometabolism. We have chosen to explore the radiometabolic profile of [C-11] MADAM, one of these radioligands widely used for in vivo PET-SERT studies. The metabolism of [C-11]MADAM/MADAM was investigated using rat and human liver microsomes (RLM and HLM) in combination with radio-HPLC or UHPLC/Q-ToF-MS for their identification. The effect of carrier on the radiometabolic rate of the radioligand [C-11]MADAM in vitro and in vivo was examined by radio-HPLC. RLM and HLM incubations were carried out at two different carrier concentrations of 1 and 10 mu M. Urine samples after perfusion of [C-11]MADAM/ MADAM in rats were also analysed by radio-HPLC. Analysis by UHPLC/Q-ToF-MS identified the metabolites produced in vitro to be results of N-demethylation, S-oxidation and benzylic hydroxylation. The presence of carrier greatly affected the radiometabolism rate of [C-11]MADAM in both RLM/HLM experiments and in vivo rat studies. The good concordance between the results predicted by RLM and HLM experiments and the in vivo data obtained in rat studies indicate that the kinetics of the radiometabolism of the radioligand [C-11]MADAM is dose-dependent.

In preclinical research, there is an increasing demand for in vivo imaging techniques to apply to animal models. Here, we report the first protocol for dopamine transporter (DAT) SPECT in common marmosets using the radioligand I-123-N-omega-fluoropropyl-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-{4-iodophenyl}nortropane (I-123-FP-CIT). Serial SPECT images were obtained on an upgraded clinical scanner to determine the distribution kinetics of I-123-FP-CIT in the marmoset brain. After intravenous injection of approximately 60 MBq of the radiotracer I-123-FP-CIT, stable and specific striatal uptake was observed for at least 4 h. Analysis of plasma samples showed rapid disappearance of the radiotracer from blood plasma within a few minutes after application, with activity declining to 4.1% of the administered activity. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 400 mu m resolution provided the details of the underlying anatomy. In a marmoset model of Parkinson's disease, which was generated by unilateral injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the nigro-striatal projection pathway, complete loss of striatal DAT binding in combination with behavioral deficits was observed. The presented study demonstrates that I-123-FP-CIT SPECT is a suitable tool to investigate DAT integrity in preclinical studies on common marmosets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The tritiated mGluR1-selective allosteric antagonist [(3)H]FTIDC (4-[1-(2-fluoropyridin-3-yl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl]-N-isopropyl-N-methyl-3,6-dihydropyridine-1(2H)-carboxamide) was identified as a radioligand having high affinity for rnGluR1-expressing CHO cells (K(D)=2.1 nM) and mouse cerebellum (K(D) = 3.7 nM). [(3)H]FTIDC bound to mGluR1 was displaced by structurally Unrelated allosteric antagonists, Suggesting there is a mutual binding pocket shared with different allosteric antagonists. The binding specificity of [(3)H]FTIDC for mGlUR1 in brain sections was demonstrated by the lack of significant binding to brain sections prepared from mGluR1-knockout mice. Ex vivo receptor Occupancy with [(3)H]FTIDC revealed that the receptor occupancy level by FTIDC correlated well with FTIDC dosage and plasma concentration. Intracerebroventricular administration of (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine is known to elicit face washing behavior that is mainly mediated by mGluR1. Inhibition of this behavioral change by FTIDC correlated with the receptor Occupancy level of mGluR1 in the brain. A linear relationship between the receptor Occupancy and in vivo activity was also demonstrated using structurally diverse mGluR1 antagonists. The receptor Occupancy assays could help provide guidelines for selecting appropriate doses of allosteric mGluR1 antagonist for examining the function of mGluR1 in vivo.

Quantification of serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in humans with [<SUP>11</SUP>C](<i>R</i>)-(-)-RWAY:: Radiometabolite(s) likely confound brain measurements	SYNAPSE			English	Article						PET; kinetic analysis; serotonin 5-HT1A; [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY; human	PET; RADIOLIGAND; DELINEATION; TRANSPORTER; MONKEY; BLOOD; MODEL	[C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY has been shown to be a promising radioligand for kimaging brain 5-HT1A receptors with positron emission tomography in rodents and nonhuman primates. We now report the first use of [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY in six healthy human subjects, using kinetic brain imaging and serial arterial measurements of plasma parent radiotracer. At 80 min after radiotracer injection, activity ratios were about three for brain receptor-rich regions compared with cerebellum. However, the washout from brain was unexpectedly slow relative to plasma clearance of the parent radiotracer. This disparity between brain and plasma activity was quantified with distribution volume calculated from increasingly truncated brain imaging data. In both receptor-rich regions and cerebellum, distribution volumes were unstable and increased continuously from 90 to 150 min by about 30%. This increasing distribution volume was unlikely due to the variations or errors of plasma input at later time points, since a similar truncation of plasma time points from 150 to 90 min did not significantly affect the analysis of the brain data. When the metabolites of [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY in human and monkey were compared, a moderate lipophilic radiometabolite was present at a significantly higher percentage of total plasma radioactivity in human than in monkey. The relatively slow washout of activity from brain and the temporal instability of distribution volume likely reflect the accumulation of radiometabolite(s) in human brain. Although prior studies in rodents and nonhuman primates showed [C-11](R)-(-)-RWAY to be a promising radiotracer, we suspect that a species difference in metabolism caused this serious deficiency in humans.

The human and ovine CRF versions bind to CRF1 receptors with significantly higher affinity than to CRF2 receptors. Recently antisauvagine-30, an N-terminally truncated version of the CRF analog sauvagine, was characterized as a specific antagonist to mouse CRF2B. We have synthesized the radiolabeled version I-125-antisauvagine-30 and tested it for its affinity at human CRF1 (hCRF(1)), hCRF(2A), Xenopus CRF1 (xCRF(1)) and xCRF(2) receptors. In control binding studies I-125-labeled hCRF, sauvagine and astressin were also bound to these receptors. I-125-antisauvagine-30 exclusively bound to hCRF(2A) and xCRF(2) but not to hCRF(1) and xCRF(1) receptors. I-125-antisauvagine-30 binding to hCRF(2A), and xCRF(2) receptors was saturable and of high affinity (hCRF(2A): K-d=125 pM; xCRF(2): K-d=1.1 nM). In displacement binding experiments using I-125-antisauvagine-30 as radioligand several CRF analogs bound to hCRF(2A) and xCRF(2) receptors with similar rank orders as reported with other CRF radioligands. Finally, preliminary studies using I-125-antisauvagine-30 binding to membrane homogenates prepared from different rat brain structures showed that the peptide bound specifically to brain areas expressing CRF2 receptors. These data demonstrate that I-125-antisauvagine-30 is the first high-affinity ligand to specifically label CRF2 receptors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In recent years, many clinical studies have employed [I-123]IBZM in SPECT studies. The aim of the present study was to characterize the binding of IBZM to dopaminergic receptor subtypes as a means of elucidating which receptor subtypes are visualized and examined by [I-123]IBZM. The affinity of IBZM for each of the major human dopamine receptors (D1, D2(short), D3, D4(4.2), and D5 receptor) was determined by competitive radioligand binding assay using membranes prepared from clonal cell lines expressing the different subtypes. Radioligands with high affinity for the D1, and D5 receptors ([H-3]SCH-23390), dopamine D2(short) and D4(4.2) receptors ([H-3]Spiroperidol), and dopamine D3 receptor ([H-3]7-OH-DPAT) were used to measure specific binding. Corresponding unlabeled displacing ligands for determination of nonspecific binding were employed. Assays were performed at 25 degreesC. These experiments show that for IBZM K-i values were 1.6 nM for dopamine D2(s) receptors and 2.2 nM for dopamine D3 receptors. There was no binding of IBZM to D1(A), D5, or D4(4.2) receptors. In conclusion, when [I-123]IBZM is used as SPECT tracer, the studies reflect dopaminergic D2 as well as D3 receptor binding. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The results indicated that 5-HT7 receptors are most abundantly localized in the anterior thalamus and in the dentate gyrus. Other regions containing intermediate levels of 5-HT7 receptors included the hypothalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala and certain brainstem nuclei.

The total synthesis time was 50-55 min. The synthesized [F-18]FECNT was evaluated in vivo in Parkinson's disease model rats.

Its low toxicity profile favors use in elderly patients or in patients with critical comorbidities. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of [177Lu]-PSMA RLT in mCRPC patients at least 80 y old. Methods:Eighty mCRPC patients at least 80 y old underwent [177Lu]-PSMA-I & T RLT and were retrospectively selected. The patients were previously treated by androgen receptor-directed therapy, received taxane-based chemotherapy, or were chemotherapy-ineligible. The best prostate specific antigen (PSA) response was calculated, as well as clinical progression-free survival (cPFS) and overall survival (OS). Toxicity data were acquired until 6 mo after the last treatment cycle. Results:Of 80 patients, 49 (61.3%) were chemotherapy-naive and 16 (20%) had visceral metastases. The median number of previous mCRPC treatment regimens was 2. In total, 324 cycles (median, 4 cycles; range, 1-12) with a median cumulative activity of 23.8 GBq (inter quartile range, 14.8-42.2) were applied. A PSA decline of 50% was achieved in 37 (46.3%) patients. Chemotherapy-naive patients showed higher 50% PSA response rates than chemotherapy-pretreated patients (51.0% vs. 38.7%, respectively). Overall, median cPFS and OS were 8.7 and 16.1 mo, respectively. The median cPFS and OS of chemotherapy-naive patients were significantly longer than those of chemotherapy-pretreated patients (10.5 vs. 6.5 mo and 20.7 vs. 11.8 mo, respectively, P , 0.05). A lower hemoglobin level and higher lactate dehydrogenase level at baseline were independent predictors of shorter cPFS and OS. Treatment-emergent grade 3 toxicities were anemia in 4 patients (5%), thrombocytopenia in 3 patients (3.8%), and renal impairment in 4 patients (5%). No nonhematologic grade 3 and no grade 4 toxicities were observed. The most frequent clinical side effects were grade 1-2 xerostomia, fatigue, and inappetence. Conclusion:[177Lu]-PSMA-I & T RLT in mCRPC patients at least 80 y old is safe and effective, comparable to previously published data on non-age-selected cohorts with a low rate of high-grade toxicities. Chemotherapy-naive patients showed a better and longer response to therapy than taxane-pretreated patients. [177Lu]-PSMA RLT seems to be a meaningful treatment option for older patients.

Synthesis and evaluation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluororasagiline, a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B)	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Monoamine oxidase; PET; Autoradiography; Fluorine-18; Biodistribution; Kinetics; Metabolites and non-human primate	POSTMORTEM HUMAN BRAIN; IN-VIVO; AUTORADIOGRAPHY; INHIBITOR; RECEPTOR; BIODISTRIBUTION; ANALOGS	The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate a novel fluorine-18 labeled analogue of rasagiline (6) as a PET radioligand for monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B). The corresponding non-radioactive fluorine-19 ligand, (1S,2S)-2-fluoro-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)indan-1-amine (4), was characterized in in vitro assays. The precursor compound (3aS,8aR)-3-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)-3,3a,8,8a-tetrahydroindeno[1,2-d][1,2,3]oxa-thiazole 2,2-dioxide (3) and reference standard 4 were synthesized in multi-step syntheses. Recombinant human MAO-B and MAO-A enzyme preparations were used in order to determine IC50 values for compound 4 by use of an enzymatic assay employing kynuramine as substrate. Radiolabeling was accomplished by a two-step synthesis, compromising a nucleophilic substitution followed by hydrolysis of the sulphamidate group. Human whole hemisphere autoradiography (ARG) was performed with [F-18]fluororasagiline. Blocking experiments with pirlindole (MAO-A), L-deprenyl and rasagiline (MAO-B) were conducted to demonstrate the specificity of the binding. A positron emission tomography (PET) study was carried out in a cynomolgus monkey where time activity curves for whole brain and regions with high and low MAO-B activity were recorded. Radiometabolites were measured in monkey plasma using gradient HPLC. Compound 4 inhibited MAO-B with an IC50 of 27 nM and MAO-A with an IC50 of 2.3 mu M. Radiolabeling of precursor 3 and subsequent hydrolysis of the protecting group towards (1S,2S)-2-[F-18]fluoro-N-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)indan-1-amine (6) was successfully accomplished with an radiochemical yield of 40-70%, a radiochemical purity higher than 99% and a specific radioactivity higher than 200 GBq/mu mol. ARG demonstrated selective binding for [F-18]fluororasagiline (6) to MAO-B containing brain regions, for example, striatum. The initial uptake in the monkey brain was 250% SUV at 4 min post injection. The highest amounts of radioactivity were observed in the striatum and thalamus as expected whereas in the cortex and cerebellum lower levels were observed. Metabolite studies demonstrated 30% unchanged radioligand at 90 min post injection. Our investigations demonstrated that the new ligand [F-18]fluororasagiline (6) binds specifically to MAO-B in vitro and has a MAO-B specific binding pattern in vivo. Thus, it could serve as a novel potential candidate for human PET studies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study we examined whether PET-measurable innate immune cell activation predicts multiple sclerosis disease progression. Activation of microglia/macrophages was measured using the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO)-binding radioligand C-11-PK11195 and PET imaging in 69 patients with multiple sclerosis and 18 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Radioligand binding was evaluated as the distribution volume ratio from dynamic PET images. Conventional MRI and disability measurements using the Expanded Disability Status Scale were performed for patients at baseline and 4.1 +/- 1.9 (mean +/- standard deviation) years later. Fifty-one (74%) of the patients were free of relapses during the follow-up period. Patients had increased activation of innate immune cells in the normal-appearing white matter and in the thalamus compared to the healthy control group (P = 0.033 and P = 0.003, respectively, Wilcoxon). Forward-type stepwise logistic regression was used to assess the best variables predicting disease progression. Baseline innate immune cell activation in the normal-appearing white matter was a significant predictor of later progression when the entire multiple sclerosis cohort was assessed [odds ratio (OR) = 4.26; P = 0.048]. In the patient subgroup free of relapses there was an association between macrophage/microglia activation in the perilesional normal-appearing white matter and disease progression (OR = 4.57; P = 0.013). None of the conventional MRI parameters measured at baseline associated with later progression. Our results strongly suggest that innate immune cell activation contributes to the diffuse neural damage leading to multiple sclerosis disease progression independent of relapses.

Using [C-11]ABP688, we previously showed that the rapidly acting antidepressant ketamine decreases mGluR5 availability. The mGluR5 radioligand [F-18]FPEB offers key advantages over [C-11]ABP688; however, its suitability for drug challenge studies is unknown. We evaluated whether [F-18]FPEB can be used to capture ketamine-induced effects on mGluR5. Seven healthy subjects participated in three [F-18]FPEB scans: a baseline, a same-day post-ketamine, and a 24-h post-ketamine scan. The outcome measure was V-T/f(P), obtained using a two-tissue compartment model and a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Dissociative symptoms, heart rate and blood pressure increased following ketamine infusion. [F-18]FPEB V-T/f(P) decreased by 9% across the cortex after ketamine infusion, with minimal difference between baseline and 24-h scans. Compared to our previous work using [C-11]ABP688, the magnitude of the ketamine-induced change in mGluR5 was smaller using [F-18]FPEB; however, effect sizes were similar for the same-day post-ketamine vs. baseline scan (Cohen's d = 0.75 for [F-18]FPEB and 0.88 for [C-11]ABP688). [F-18]FPEB is therefore able to capture some of the effects of ketamine on mGluR5, but [C-11]ABP688 appears to be more suitable in drug challenge paradigms designed to probe glutamate transmission.

However, a limitation of currently used PET radioligands for H3R is the slow binding kinetics in high density brain regions. To address this, we herein report the development of three novel candidate H3R radioligands, namely, [carbonyl-C-11]AZ13153556 ([ carbonyl-C-11]4), [carbonyl-C-11]AZD5213([carbonyl-C-11]5), and [carbonyl-C-11]AZ13198083 ([carbonyl-C-11]6), and their subsequent preclinical evaluation in nonhuman primates (NHP). Radioligands [carbonyl-C-11]4-6 were produced and isolated in high radioactivity (>1000 MBq), radiochemical purity (>99%), and moderate molar activity (19-28 GBq/mu mol at time of injection) using a palladium-mediated C-11-aminocarbonylation protocol. All three radioligands showed high brain permeability as well as a regional brain radioactivity distribution in accordance with H3R expression (striatum > cortex > cerebellum). [Carbonyl-C-11]6 displayed the most favorable in vivo kinetics and brain uptake, with an early peak in the striatal time-activity curve followed by a progressive washout from the brain. The specificity and on-target kinetics of [carbonyl-C-11]6 were next investigated in pretreatment and displacement studies. After pretreatment or displacement with 5 (0.1 mg/kg), a uniformly low distribution of radioactivity across the NHP brain was observed. Collectively, this work demonstrates that [carbonyl-C-11]6 is a promising candidate for H3R imaging in human subjects.

Tropisetron is an orthosteric ligand at both 5-HT3 and alpha 7 nACh receptors and its binding orientation has been determined in the structural homologue AChBP (pdbid: 2WNC). Co-crystallisation with a structurally related ligand, granisetron, reveals an almost identical orientation (pdbid; 2YME). However, there is a >1000-fold difference in the affinity of tropisetron at 5-HT3 versus alpha 7 nACh receptors, and alpha 7 nACh receptors do not bind granisetron. These striking pharmacological differences prompt questions about which receptor the crystal structures most closely represent and whether the ligand orientations are correct. Here we probe the binding orientation of tropisetron and granisetron at 5-HT3 receptors by in silico modelling and docking, radioligand binding on cysteine-substituted 5-HT3 receptor mutants transiently expressed in HEK 293 cells, and synthetic modification of the ligands. For 15 of the 23 cysteine substitutions, the effects on tropisetron and granisetron were different. Structure-activity relationships on synthesised derivatives of both ligands were also consistent with different orientations, revealing that contrary to the crystallographic evidence from AChBP, the two ligands adopt different orientations in the 5-HT3 receptor binding site. Our results show that even quite structurally similar molecules can adopt different orientations in the same binding site, and that caution may be needed when using homologous proteins to predict ligand binding.

Our radioligand binding study of membrane preparations and intact cells revealed that a large fraction of the V-1B receptor is located in the cytoplasm in unstimulated CHO cells, which is in contrast to the plasma membrane localization of the V-1A and V-2 receptors. Moreover, when the affinity of radiolabeled arginine-vasopressin ([H-3]AVP) was compared between membrane preparations and intact cells, the affinity of [H-3]AVP to the cell surface V-1B receptors, but not the V-1A receptors, was significantly reduced. Although the number and affinity of cell surface V-1B receptors decreased, they became extensively internalized upon binding with [H-3]AVP. Approximately 87% of cell surface-bound [H-3]AVP was internalized and became resistant to acid wash during incubation with 1 nM [H-3]AVP. By contrast, less ligand (35%) was internalized in the cells expressing the V-1A receptor. Extensive internalization of the V-1B receptors was partially attenuated by inhibitors of cytoskeletal proteins, siRNA against beta-arrestin 2, or the removal of sodium chloride from the extracellular buffer, indicating that this internalization involves clathrin-coated pits. Together, these results indicate that the mechanism that regulates the number and affinity of V-1B receptors in the plasma membrane is markedly distinct from the corresponding mechanisms for the V-1A and V-2 receptors and plays a critical role under stress conditions, when vasopressin release is augmented.

Antagonism of the adenosine A(1) receptor may offer therapeutic benefits in complex neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The aim of this study was to discover potential selective adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists. Several analogs of 8-(3-phenylpropyl)xanthines (3), 8-(2-phenylethyl)xanthines (4) and 8-(phenoxymethyl) xanthines (5) were synthesized and assessed as antagonists of the adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors via radioligand binding assays. The results indicated that the 1,3,7-triethyl-substituted analogs (3d, 4d, and 5d), among each series, displayed the highest affinity for the adenosine A(1) receptor with K-i values in the nanomolar range. This ethyl-substitution pattern was previously unknown to enhance adenosine A(1) receptor binding affinity. The 1,3,7-triethyl-substituted analogs (3d, 4d, and 5d) behaved as adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists in GTP shift assays performed with either rat cortical or whole brain membranes expressing adenosine A(1) receptors. Further, in vivo evaluation of 3d showed reversal of adenosine A(1) receptor agonist-induced hypolocomotion. In conclusion, the most potent evaluated compound, 8-(3-phenylpropyl)-1,3,7-triethylxanthine (3d), showed both in vitro and in vivo activity, and therefore represent a novel adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist that may have potential as a drug candidate for dementia disorders.

This study evaluated the binding affinity and specificity of the ligands for the NMDA receptor. Methods: Ligand biodistribution and uptake specificity in the brain were investigated in mice. Binding affinity and specificity were determined by radioligand receptor binding assay. Three antagonists were used for competitive binding analysis. In addition, uptake of the complexes into SH-SY5Y nerve cells was evaluated. Results: The radiochemical purity of Tc-99m-labeled ligands was more than 95%. Analysis of brain regional uptake showed higher concentration in the frontal lobe and specific uptake in the hippocampus. Tc-99m-NCAM reached a higher target to nontarget ratio than Tc-99m-NHAM. The results indicated that Tc-99m-NCAM bound to a single site on the NMDA receptor with a K-d of 701.21 nmol/l and a B-max of 62.47 nmol/mg. Specific inhibitors of the NMDA receptor, ketamine and dizocilpine, but not the dopamine D-2 and 5HT(1A) receptor partial agonist aripiprazole, inhibited specific binding of Tc-99m-NCAM to the NMDA receptor. Cell physiology experiments showed that NCAM can increase the viability of SH-SY5Y cells after glutamate-induced injury. Conclusions: The new radioligand Tc-99m-NCAM has good affinity for and specific binding to the NMDA receptor, and easily crosses the blood-brain barrier; suggesting that it might be a potentially useful tracer for NMDA receptor expression.

Both ligands showed increased uptake and BP in the regions of local brain damage. However, regional BP values for [C-11]vinpocetine were markedly higher than those for [C-11]PK11195. This feature of the former radioligand may be related to its high brain uptake and marked affinity to the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding sites (PBBS), characteristic for glia cells. As local brain traumas entail reactive glia accumulation in and around the site of the damage, the present findings may indicate that [C-11]vinpocetine marks the place or boundaries of local brain damage by binding to the PBBS present in glia cells, which, in turn, accumulate in the region of the damage. The present findings (i) confirm earlier observations with [C-11]PK11195 as a potential glia marker in PET studies and (ii) support the working hypothesis that [C-11]vinpocetine is a potentially useful PET marker of regional and global brain damage resulting in glia accumulation locally or globally in the human brain. The comparative analysis of the two ligands indicate that [C-11]vinpocetine shows a number of characteristics favourable in comparison with [C-11]PK11195. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Rats unilaterally lesioned with different doses of 6-ORDA underwent two types of in vivo experiments: (1) a rotational behavioral study with methamphetamine (MAP) or apomorphine (APO); and (2) a positron emission tomography (PET) study with [C-11]PE21 (radioligand for dopamine transporters) or [C-11]raclopride (radioligand for dopamine D2 receptors). An in vitro autoradiographic study with the same radioligands was also conducted. The number of rotations after the MAP or APO injection increased with increased doses of 6-OHDA. The in vitro and in vivo binding of [C-11]PE21 dose-dependently decreased in response to the 6-OHDA injections, while that of [C-11]raclopride dose-dependently increased. There was a significant negative hyperbolic correlation between the number of rotations after MAP injection and the binding of [C-11]PE21. In contrast, there was a significant positive linear correlation between the number of rotations after APO injections and the binding of [C-11]raclopride. These results robustly reveal a molecular pharmacological basis of parkinsonian symptoms in animal models of PD, and indicate the utility and validity of in vivo PET measurements in assessing pre- and post-synaptic dopaminergic functions.

Techniques to assess apoptosis in living organisms are limited and, in the case of solid organs, restricted to histological examination of biopsy samples. We investigated the use of I-124-annexin V, which binds to phosphatidylserine (PS) on the surface of apoptotic cells, as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for the noninvasive measurernent of apoptosis in vivo. Annexin V and a similar-sized protein, ovalbumin, were directly labelled with I-124. We report the validation of I-124-annexin V in vitro and in an animal model of liver apoptosis that has not previously been used to test iodinated annexin V. Also, for the first time, we report metabolite analysis of I-124-annexin V and the correlation of I-124-annexin V uptake with apoptotic density (AD). Sixfold more I-124-annexin V was associated with Jurkat cells after apoptosis induction, indicating that PS binding by annexin V was preserved after iodination. I-124-ovalbumin did not demonstrate increased uptake in apoptotic cells. In normal BDF-1 mice, the radioligand was rapidly cleared, but some in vivo dehalogenation resulted in the accumulation of activity in the thyroid and stomach content. PET images demonstrated uptake of I-124-annexin V but not I-124-ovalbumin in apoptotic liver lesions. In vivo I-124-annexin V uptake, derived from PET images, correlated with histologically derived AD (r=.86, P<.01). These results demonstrate that I-124-annexin V is localised to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis, in contrast to I-124-ovalbumin, which did not show preferential uptake in the apoptotic liver.

Radioligand competition experiments at D1 and D2L receptors were performed by using [H-3]SCH23390 and [H-3]spiperone, respectively. Functional assays included measurements of cAMP, intracellular [Ca2+], and [S-35]GTPgammaS-binding. LE300 was the most potent compound with a 10- to 20-fold selectivity for D1 over D2L receptors as measured in equilibrium binding experiments [competition radioligand binding: K-i(D1)=1.9 nM, K-i(D2L)=44.7 nM; [S-35]GTPgammaS-binding: K-i(D1)=1.8 nM, K-i(D2L)=21.5 nM]. In functional (non-equilibrium) experiments, LE300 did not reveal a D1 over D2L selectivity but retained nanomolar K-i values at human dopamine receptors (measurement of cAMP: K-i(D1)=25.9 nM, K-i(D2L)=5.2 nM; measurement of intracellular [Ca2+]: K-i(D1)=60.4 nM, K-i(D2L)=19.0 nM). LE300 is currently under investigation for usefulness as positrone emission tomography ligand. In conclusion, LE300 is a novel type of a nanomolar dopamine receptor antagonist combining structural core elements of dopamine and serotonin, and may become useful as positrone emission tomography ligand.

In contrast, reactivity to prokaryotically expressed CYP2D6 protein and synthetic peptides is significantly lower in HCV infection than in AIH. The aim of the present study was to characterize LKM1 reactivity against a panel of eukaryotically expressed CYP2D6 constructs in the two conditions. LKM1-positive sera obtained from 16 patients with AIH and 16 with HCV infection were used as probes to perform a complete epitope mapping of CYP2D6. Reactivity to the full-length protein and 16 constructs thereof was determined by radioligand assay. We found that antigenicity is confined to the portion of the molecule C-terminal of aa 193, no reactivity being detectable against the aa sequence 1-193. Reactivity increases stepwise toward the C-terminal in both AIH and HCV, but the frequency of reactivity in the two conditions differs significantly between aa 267-337. To further characterize this region, we introduced a five and a three amino acid swap mutation selected from the homologous regions of CYP2C9 and HCV. This maneuver resulted in a substantial loss of LKM1 binding in both conditions, suggesting that this region contains a major epitope. Molecular modeling revealed that CYP2D6(316-327) is exposed on the surface of the protein, and may represent a key target for the autoantibody. These findings provide an initial characterization of the antigenic constitution of the target of LKM1 in AIH and HCV infection.

To explore a possible biological basis for this hypothesis, noradrenergic proteins in the locus coeruleus (LC) were measured in long-term cigarette smokers and in nonsmokers. The LC was studied because elevated amounts of alpha (2)-adrenoceptors and tyrosine hydroxylase have been observed postmortem in the LCs of subjects with major depression or who commit suicide, and because lon-term administration of antidepressant drugs to rats down-regulates these proteins in the LC. Methods: Postmortem LCs were obtained from long-term cigarette smokers (n=7) and from nonsmokers (n = 9), all of whom lacked diagnoses of major depression. Amounts of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and radioligand binding to the norepinephrine transporter, monoamine oxidase A, and alpha (2)-adrenoceptors were measured. Results: Amounts of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity and radioligand binding to alpha (2)-adrenoceptors were significantly lower (approximately 60% and 40%, respectively) along the axis of the LCs of long-term smokers compared with nonsmokers. Smoking had no statistically significant effects on binding to monoamine oxidase A or to the norepinephrine transporter. Conclusion: This is the first demonstration that cigarette smoking affects noradrenergic proteins in the LC. The direction of these changes is opposite to that observed when comparing subjects who have major depression with normal controls and the same as that produced by long-term antidepressant treatment in animals. If the present observations reflect long-term effects of smoking on premortem noradrenergic biochemistry, smoking-induced changes in LC biochemistry may strengthen the smoking habit among subjects with major depression.

For this reason, the aim of the present study was to compare the density of CCK-A and -B receptors and the mRNA encoding preproCCK throughout the brains of an alcohol-preferring (Fawn Hooded) rat strain with that of a non-alcohol-preferring (Wistar Kyoto) strain of rat. Our study revealed significant differences with regard to the central CCK system of the FH compared to the WKY rat, including differences in CCK-A receptor binding throughout the dorsal medulla, and altered CCK-B binding density throughout the cerebral cortex and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The most striking result, given the altered behavioural phenotype of the FH rat, was the 33% lower density of CCKmRNA measured throughout the ventral tegmental area of the FH rat when compared to the: WKY. This study also reports on a protocol to utilise a novel radioligand, [I-125]-D-Tyr-Gly-A-71378, for autoradiographic detection of CCK-A receptors throughout the rat brain. As previously reported, CCK-A receptors were located throughout the area postrema, interpeduncular nucleus and nucleus tractus solitarii; however, binding to CCK-A receptors was also visualised throughout the medial pre-optic area, the arcuate nucleus and the circumventricular regions of the ventral hypothalamus, regions known to contain CCK-A receptors but which were previously undetectable using autoradiography in rat brain.

Although rare, mixed small neuroendocrine tumor/acinar adenocarcinoma exhibit aggressive behavior that necessitates optimal therapy. Molecular imaging has been implemented previously to assess radioligand therapy eligibility in such cases. Interestingly, the uptake of radiotracers targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and somatostatin receptor may be reduced and can potentially lead to false negative readings in certain tumor types with hybrid features. Therefore, physicians should be aware of different kinds of disparities when assessing these tumor types with the aforementioned modalities.

This effect was reversed by GppNHp. Captopril also enhanced BK-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation in saponin-treated coronary rings, and GppNHp partially suppressed this enhancement. These results suggest that captopril may affect BK receptors that couple to G-proteins.

We aim to explore the clinical outcomes of Lu-177 PSMA-RLT in this population. MethodsWe evaluated 84 patients with progressive mCRPC receiving Lu-177 PSMA-RLT between 9 May 2018 and 21 February 2022. Lu-177-PSMA-I&T was administered at 6-8-week intervals. Primary end point was overall survival (OS), and secondary end points included prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival (PFS), PSA response rate, clinical response, toxicity assessment, and prognostic indicators. ResultsThe median OS and PSA PFS were 12.2 and 5.2 months, respectively. PSA decline of >= 50% was observed in 51.8% of patients. Patients achieving PSA response had longer median OS (15.0 vs. 9.5 months, p = .03) and PSA PFS (6.5 vs. 2.9 months, p < .001). Pain score improvement was seen in 19 out of 34 patients. A hematotoxicity of >= grade 3 was observed in 13 out of 78 patients. Multivariable analyses showed that PSA velocity, alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin (Hb), and the number of treatment cycles were independent prognostic indicators for OS. The retrospective design was the main limitation of the study. ConclusionsOur study demonstrated a similar safety and efficacy of Lu-177 PSMA-RLT in Asian mCRPC patients compared to the existing literature. A PSA decline >= 50% was associated with longer OS and PSA PFS. Several prognostic indicators for patient outcomes were also identified.

Methods: The data of 57 patients with a mean age of 68 years who were treated with Lu-177 PSMA I&T were retrospectively reviewed. Secondary toxicity to treatment was determined using the criteria of the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0. The Kaplan Meier method was used for survival and progression-free survival analysis. Results: Forty percent of patients' serum PSA values' showed >25% regression after the first cycle of treatment. Serum PSA values were stable/regressed in 75% of the patients. While 2/57 patients showed grade 3 anemia, none showed grade 3 leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. One of 57 patient showed transient nephrotoxicity. Hematological and nephrological toxicity were not observed after treatment of eight cycles, and the serum PSA values of the patients were decreased by 97%. The mean survival time was 11.6 months in all patients, and 17.2 months in patients with serum PSA response. Progression-free survival was an average of 9.9 months. Conclusion: Providing a stable or regressed disease via single cycle treatment in 75% of patients with progression despite the treatments improving survival is an indicator of the success of the therapy. The low rate of hematological and nephrological toxicity in patients (none of the patients that received eight cycles) suggests that the treatment is reliable. Survival was longer in patients with serum PSA response after treatment.

Here, the extracellular vestibule of the M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is targeted for structure-based design of allosteric modulators. Accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations were performed to construct structural ensembles that account for the receptor flexibility. Compounds obtained from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) were docked to the receptor ensembles. Retrospective docking of known ligands showed that combining aMD simulations with Glide induced fit docking (IFD) provided much-improved enrichment factors, compared with the Glide virtual screening workflow. Glide IFD was thus applied in receptor ensemble docking, and 38 top-ranked NCI compounds were selected for experimental testing. In [H-3]N-methylscopolamine radioligand dissociation assays, approximately half of the 38 lead compounds altered the radioligand dissociation rate, a hallmark of allosteric behavior. In further competition binding experiments, we identified 12 compounds with affinity of <= 30 mu M. With final functional experiments on six selected compounds, we confirmed four of them as new negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) and one as positive allosteric modulator of agonist-mediated response at the M-2 mAChR. Two of the NAMs showed subtype selectivity without significant effect at the M-1 and M-3 mAChRs. This study demonstrates an unprecedented successful structure-based approach to identify chemically diverse and selective GPCR allosteric modulators with outstanding potential for further structure-activity relationship studies.

Synthesis and Evaluation of Technetium-99m-Labeled Bioreductive Pharmacophores Conjugated with Amino Acids and Peptides for Tumor Imaging	CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN			English	Article						amino acids and peptides; bioreductive pharmacophore; technetium-99m labeling; tumor imaging	BREAST-CANCER; POTENTIAL USE; RGD PEPTIDE; RECEPTOR; TC-99M-TRICARBONYL; COMPLEXES; GROWTH	Development of molecular imaging agents to target tumor has become a major trend in nuclear medicine. With the aim to develop new potential Tc-99m-radiopharmaceuticals for targeting tumor, we have synthesized 5-nitroimidazolyl amino acids and RGD-coupled 2-nitroimidazoles. Technetium-99m radiolabeling with high radiochemical purity (>90%) was achieved for all the compounds. The radiolabeled complexes exhibited substantial in vitro stability in saline, serum, and histidine solution (10(-2)m). Cell binding studies in EAC and B16F10 cell lines also revealed rapid and comparatively high cellular internalization. Among all the compounds studied, the binding of Tc-99m(CO)(3)-5 to B16F10 cells was moderately inhibited by the competitive peptide c[RGDfV], suggesting specificity of the radioligand toward (v3) receptor. However, no significant displacement of bound radioligand was observed when the binding of the Tc-99m-labeled complexes to above cells was challenged with excess competitive peptide. Fluorescent microscopy study provided direct evidence of intracellular localization of 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein-labeled 2-nitroimidazolyl-RGD-peptide in (v3)-positive B16F10 mouse melanoma cell line. The ligands caused only 8-13% of hemolysis toward rat erythrocytes at concentrations as high as 100m. Imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in Swiss albino mice bearing induced tumor. Tc-99m-1 and Tc-99m(CO)(3)-5 demonstrated a very favorable in vivo profile. Selective uptake and retention in tumor with encouraging tumor/muscle and tumor/blood ratio and significant cellular uptake of fluorescence-labeled-2-nitroimidazolyl RGD indicate the great potentiality of the pharmacophore for further evaluation as potential molecular imaging agent in cancer diagnosis.

Characterization of AZD4694, a novel fluorinated Aβ plaque neuroimaging PET radioligand	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; amyloid; neuroimaging; positron emission tomography; Tg2576	PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; PRECLINICAL ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AMYLOID-BETA; NONDEMENTED INDIVIDUALS; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; IN-VIVO; NEUROPATHOLOGY; TRACER; PIB; DEPOSITION	P>Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands that bind selectively to beta-amyloid plaques (A beta) are promising imaging tools aimed at supporting the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and the evaluation of new drugs aiming to modify amyloid plaque load. For extended clinical use, there is a particular need for PET tracers labeled with fluorine-18, a radionuclide with 110 min half-life allowing for central synthesis followed by wide distribution. The development of fluorinated radioligands is, however, challenging because of the lipophilic nature of aromatic fluorine, rendering fluorinated ligands more prone to have high non-specific white matter binding. We have here developed the new benzofuran-derived radioligand containing fluorine, AZD4694 that shows high affinity for beta-amyloid fibrils in vitro (K(d) = 2.3 +/- 0.3 nM). In cortical sections from human Alzheimer's disease brain [3H]AZD4694 selectively labeled beta-amyloid deposits in gray matter, whereas there was a lower level of non-displaceable binding in plaque devoid white matter. Administration of unlabeled AZD4694 to rat showed that it has a pharmacokinetic profile consistent with good PET radioligands, i.e., it quickly entered and rapidly cleared from normal rat brain tissue. Ex vivo binding data in aged Tg2576 mice after intravenous administration of [3H]AZD4694 showed selective binding to beta-amyloid deposits in a reversible manner. In Tg2576 mice, plaque bound [3H]AZD4694 could still be detected 80 min after i.v. administration. Taken together, the preclinical profile of AZD4694 suggests that fluorine-18 labeled AZD4694 may have potential for PET-visualization of cerebral beta-amyloid deposits in the living human brain.

Jeffrey			A novel family of potent negative allosteric modulators of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							2-METHYL-6-(PHENYLETHYNYL)-PYRIDINE MPEP; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE; ANTAGONIST; RAT; ACTIVATION; SUBTYPE-5; AGONIST; BINDING; MGLURS; RADIOLIGAND	Group II metabotropic glutamate receptors ( mGluRs), mGluR2 and mGluR3, play a number of important roles in mammalian brain and represent exciting new targets for certain central nervous system disorders. We now report synthesis and characterization of a novel family of derivatives of dihydrobenzo[ 1,4] diazepin-2-one that are selective negative allosteric modulators for group II mGluRs. These compounds inhibit both mGluR2 and mGluR3 but have no activity at group I and III mGluRs. The novel mGluR2/3 antagonists also potently block mGluR2/3- mediated inhibition of the field excitatory postsynaptic potentials at the perforant path synapse in hippocampal slices. These compounds induce a rightward shift and decrease the maximal response in the glutamate concentration-response relationship, consistent with a noncompetitive antagonist mechanism of action. Furthermore, radioligand binding studies revealed no effect on binding of the orthosteric antagonist [H-3] LY341495 [2S-2-amino-2-(1S, 2S-2-carboxycyclopropan1- yl)-3-( xanth-9-yl) propionic acid]. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that a single point mutation in transmembrane V ( N735D), previously shown to be an important residue for potentiation activity of the mGluR2 allosteric potentiator LY487379 [ N-(4-(2-methoxyphenoxy) phenyl)- N-( 2,2,2- trifluoroethylsulfonyl) pyrid- 3- ylmethylamine], is not critical for the inhibitory activity of negative allosteric modulators of group II mGluRs. However, this single mutation in human GluR2 almost completely blocked the enhancing activity of biphenyl- indanone A, a novel allosteric potentiator of mGluR2. Our data suggest that these two positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2 may share a common binding site and that this site may be distinct from the binding site for the new negative allosteric modulators of group II mGluRs.

We examined the ability of AM 251 to inhibit sodium channel-dependent functions and the binding of [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate to sodium channels in mouse brain synaptic preparations. Depolarization of synaptoneurosomes by the sodium channel site 2-specific neurotoxin veratridine, which is abolished by tetrodotoxin, was found to be inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by AM 251 (IC50=8.9 muM). Veratridine-dependent (tetrodotoxin suppressible) release, of L-glutamic acid and GABA from synaptosomes was also reduced by AM 251 [IC50S=8.5 muM (L-glutamic acid), 9.2 muM (GABA)]. The binding of the radioligand [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate to site 2 on sodium channels was displaced by AM 251 (IC(50=)11.2 muM). Scatchard analysis of binding showed that at its IC50, AM 251 increased (by 2.3 times) the K-D of radioligand without altering B-max, suggesting a competitive mechanism of inhibition by AM 251. Kinetic experiments indicated that AM 251 inhibits equilibrium binding by allosterically accelerating the dissociation of the [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha-benzoate: sodium channel complex. Our data suggest that micromolar concentrations of AM 251 are capable of reducing neuronal excitability and inhibiting release of excitatory and inhibitory transmitters through blockade of voltage-sensitive sodium channels in brain.

Much research has been accomplished, mainly focusing on the SERT binding sites in the central nervous system (CNS). However, the biodistribution of [I-123] ADAM using whole body autoradiography (WBAR) has never been previously described, to the best of our knowledge. In this study, we assayed the biodistribution of [I-123] ADAM in tissues/organs removed from mice, and measured their radioactivity with a scintillation counter (SC). The results showed that the liver has the highest uptake. On the other hand, the WBAR clearly demonstrated that [I-123] ADAM was bound to SERT-rich sites including those in the brain stem, lung, adrenal glands and intestinal mucosa. This radiotracer also accumulated in the liver, kidney, and thyroid. The results from both methods were compared; each has its own complementary role in the biodistribution studies. The SC method revealed the total amount of radiotracer accumulation in each organ, and the WBAR demonstrated more anatomical details of the radiotracer's distribution. The whole body distribution results of the radioligand using both methods explore the usage of this novel radioligand for most possible SERT binding sites, not only in the CNS but also in the peripheral nervous system and neuroendocrine tissues. These findings suggest that [I-123] ADAM is a potentially useful imaging agent for SERT. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We have previously shown that guinea pigs treated with norepinephrine (NE) for 7 days have myocytes that are desensitized to beta-AR-agonist stimulation, and that pertussis toxin restores these responses. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether pertussis toxin specifically upregulated beta(2)-ARs in myocytes from NE-treated guinea pigs. The sole beta-AR subtype in control guinea pig myocytes was confirmed as beta(1)-AR by radioligand binding, single-cell autoradiography, and concentration-response curves to isoproterenol in contracting myocytes. In contrast, a minor pool of beta(2)-ARs was observed in rat myocytes by use of the same methods. NE treatment decreased the maximum isoproterenol response (relative to high Ca2+) from 0.89 +/- 0.06 to 0.58 +/- 0.08 (n = 7, P < 0.01) and the pD(2) (-log EC50) from 8.8 +/- 0.2 to 7.5 +/- 0.2 (n = 7, P, 0.01). Pertussis toxin treatment increased the isoproterenolto-Ca2+ ratio to 0.88 +/- 0.04 (n = 6, P< 0.05) and the pD(2) to 8.6 +/- 0.3 (P< 0.01). This was not mediated by increases in either number or function of beta(2)-ARs. G(i) is therefore able to modulate beta(1)-AR responses in guinea pig myocytes.

Afobazole binding sites were found to be identical to those of the prototype Sigmar1 agonists (+)-pentazocine and PRE-084. Depending on the structure of the prototype ligand and the in vitro incubation conditions, the specific binding of afobazole with Sigmar1 in brain homogenates from inbred mice was characterized by different receptor interaction models. In competitive displacement of [G-H-3]PRE-084, the affinity of Sigmar1 for afobazole in BALB/c mice was significantly greater than that in C57B1/6 and CD-1 mice.	[Abramova, E. V.; Voronin, M.

However, a recent study found that [C-11]befloxatone binding potential (k(3)/k(4)) has a poor correlation with MAO-A protein levels measured in the human brain. We here show that this poor correlation only depends on the choice of the parameter when performing kinetic modeling. In particular, the total volume of distribution of [C-11] befloxatone shows a tight correlation with both protein and mRNA levels of MAO-A in the human brain.

In this study, we investigated molecular imaging and biochemical responses after a single cycle of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617/[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy in patients who had progressed on [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy. Methods: Seventeen patients with mCRPC were included in a retrospective, monocenter study. Molecular imaging-based response was assessed by modified PERCIST criteria using the whole-body total lesion PSMA (TLP) and molecular tumour volume (MTV) derived from [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Biochemical response was evaluated according to PCWG3 criteria using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serum value. Concordance and correlation statistics as well as survival analyses were performed. Results: Based on the molecular imaging-based response assessment, 5 (29.4%) patients showed partial remission and 7 (41.2%) had stable disease. The remaining 5 (29.4%) patients had further progression, four with an increase in TLP/MTV of >30% and one with stable TLP/MTV but appearance of new metastases. Based on the biochemical response assessment, 5 (29.4%), 8 (47.1%), and 4 (23.5%) patients showed partial remission, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. A comparison of the response assessment methods showed a concordance of 100% (17/17) between TLP and MTV and 70.6% (12/17) between TLP/MTV and PSA. Patients with partial remission, independently assessed by each method, had better overall survival (OS) than patients with either stable or progressive disease. The difference in OS was statistically significant for the molecular imaging response assessment (median OS not reached vs. 8.3 m, p = 0.044), but not for the biochemical response assessment (median OS 18.1 m vs. 9.4 m, p = 0.468). Conclusion: Based on both assessment methods, [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617/[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 tandem therapy is an effective treatment for the highly challenging cohort of patients with mCRPC who have progressed on [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 monotherapy. Molecular imaging response and biochemical PSA response were mostly concordant, though a considerable number of cases (29.4%) were discordant. Molecular imaging response reflecting the change in total viable tumour burden appears to be superior to PSA change in estimating survival outcome after tandem therapy.

We aimed to assess the outcome and safety of rechallenge PSMA-RLT in patients with progressive prostatic cancer who previously benefited from this therapy. Materials and methods Patients who received rechallenge therapy at our department from January 2015 to March 2018 were assessed. Non-haematological and haematological adverse events were evaluated from laboratory data and clinical reports and were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 5.0). Time to prostate-specific-antigen (PSA) progression and the overall survival (OS) rate of the study patients were calculated from the date of the first rechallenge cycle. Furthermore, the OS calculated from the first cycle baseline PSMA-RLT was compared with the survival of patients who received only baseline PSMA-RLT. The response data were determined using [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-PET/CT and measurements of the tumour marker PSA. Results Included in this retrospective study were 30 patients who were initially treated with a median of 3 cycles (range 1-5) of PSMA-RLT and were eventually retreated after a median of 6 months (range 2-26). Each patient received a median of 3 (range 1-6) rechallenge cycles. None of the patients experienced a disabling or life-threatening grade 4 adverse event according to the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC). Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 8 patients (27%). Serious adverse events included leucopoenia (n = 2), neutropoenia (n = 1), anaemia (n = 4), thrombopenia (n = 4) and elevated renal parameters (n = 1). Irreversible adverse events occurred in 21 patients (70%). The permanent adverse events were mild/moderate (CTC grade 1/2) in 19 patients and serious (CTC grade 3) in two patients, respectively. According to PSA measurements, 75-90% of patients showed a benefit (response/stable) from the first 4 rechallenge cycles. The median OS was 12 months calculated from the first rechallenge cycle and 25 months calculated from the first cycle baseline PSMA-RLT. For comparison, the median OS in patients who received only baseline PSMA-RLT was 9 months. The difference according to the logrank test was significant: p value < 0.001. Patients with a PSA decrease after the first cycle of rechallenge PSMA-RLT survived a median of 19 months, while patients with a PSA increase survived only 6 months. Conclusion Rechallenge prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) therapy has an acceptable safety profile. The majority of the retreated patients benefited from the rechallenge therapy. Patients who showed a biochemical response achieved a longer OS compared to patients who did not respond. The median OS was significantly longer in patients after rechallenge PSMA-RLT than in patients who received only baseline PSMA-RLT.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						GPR83; PEN; proSAAS; orphan receptor; GPCR; peptide	RECEPTOR; HETERODIMERIZATION	G protein-coupled receptor 83 (GPR83) is a class A G protein-coupled receptor with predominant expression in the cerebellum and proposed function in the regulation of food intake and in anxiety-like behavior. The neuropeptide PEN has been suggested as a specific GPR83 ligand. However, conflicting reports exist about whether PEN is indeed able to bind and activate GPR83. This study was initiated to evaluate PEN as a potential ligand of GPR83. Employing several second messenger and other GPCR activation assays as well as a radioligand binding assay, and using multiple GPR83 plasmids and PEN peptides from different sources, no experimental evidence was found to support a role of PEN as a GPR83 ligand.

Due to their structural similarity with anandamide, we have evaluated their ability to bind to rodent cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 by a standard receptor binding assay using [H-3]CP-55,940 as a radioligand. The alkamides exhibited selective affinity especially to CB2 receptors and can therefore be considered as CB ligands. Most of the alkamides showed good metabolic stability as indicated by the similarity between affinity to CB1 determined in the presence/absence of the protease inhibitor PMSF. It is suggested that CB2 interactions may be the molecular mode of action of Echinacea alkamides as immunomodulators.

[Phe(p-NHCOCH2Br)(4)] TIPP exhibited high affinity for cloned delta receptors (IC50 = 5.4 nM), and incubation with only 2.5 nM resulted in 85% wash resistant inhibition of radioligand binding to delta receptors. Therefore, this peptide is a potent affinity label for further study of 6 opioid receptors. (C) 2002 American Chemical Society.

[11C]AFE (12) was prepared from its monomethylamino precursor 11 by reaction with high specific activity [C-11]methyl triflate. Radiochemical yield was 32 +/- 17% based on [C-11]methyl triflate (n = 6) and specific activity was 1670 +/- 864 Ci/mmol at end of synthesis (EOS, n = 6). Bindingassays indicated that AFE displays high affinity for SERT (K-i 1.80 nM for BERT) and lower affinity for norepinephrine transporter (K-i = 946 nM for hNET) or dopamine transporter (K-i > 10,000 nM for hDAT). In addition, AFE displays negligible binding affinities for other serotonin and doparnine receptors, indicating an excellent binding selectivity in vitro. Biodistribution studies in rats indicated that [C-11]AFE enters the brain readily and localizes in regions known to contain high concentrations of SERT, such as the thalamus, hypothalamus, frontal cortex and striatum. Moreover, such binding in SERT-rich brain regions is reduced significantly by pretreatment with either citalopram or the cold compound itself, but not by nisoxetine or GBR 12935, thus demonstrating that [C-11]AFE binding in the rat brain is saturable, specific and selective for the SERT. Imaging experiments in baboons indicated that the uptake pattern of [C-11]AFE is consistent with the known distribution of SERT in the baboon brain, with high levels of radioactivity detected in the midbrain and thalamus, moderate levels in the hippocampus and striatum and low levels in the cortical regions. The uptake kinetics of [C-11]AFE in the baboon brain is rapid, with activity in the midbrain and thalamus peaking at 15-40 min postinjection. Pretreatment of the baboon with citalopram, (4 mg/kg) 20 min before radioactivity injection reduced the binding of [C-11]AFE in all SERT-containing brain regions to the level in the cerebellum. Kinetic analysis revealed that in all brain regions examined, [C-11]AFE specific-to-nonspecific partition coefficients (V-3") are similar to those of [C-11]McN5652 and [C-11]2-[2-[[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenyl]thio]-5-fluorophenylamine (C-11]AFA), but lower than those of [C-11]2-[2[[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenyl]thio]-5-fluoromethylphenylamine ([C-11]AFM) or [C-11]DASB. In summary, [C-11]AFE appears to be a PET radioligand with fast brain uptake kinetics and can be used for the visualization and quantification of SERT in vivo. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Biomarkers Consortium Radioligand	<SUP>11</SUP>C-ER176, a Radioligand for 18-kDa Translocator Protein, Has Adequate Sensitivity to Robustly Image All Three Affinity Genotypes in Human Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO); C-11-ER176; positron emission tomography; rs6971 polymorphism; XBD173	IN-VIVO; 18 KDA; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; BINDING; TSPO; NEUROINFLAMMATION; NOMENCLATURE; INFLAMMATION; BIOMARKER	For PET imaging of 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker of neuroinflammation, most second-generation radioligands are sensitive to the single nucleotide polymorphism rs6971; however, this is probably not the case for the prototypical agent C-11-PK11195 N-butan-2-yl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide), which has a relatively lower signal-to-noise ratio. We recently found that C-11-ER176 (C-11-(R)-N-sec-butyl-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylquinazoline-2-carboxamide), a new analog of C-11-(R)-PK11195, showed little sensitivity to rs6971 when tested in vitro and had high specific binding in monkey brain. This study sought, first, to determine whether the sensitivity of C-11-ER176 in humans is similar to the low sensitivity measured in vitro and, second, to measure the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND, or the ratio of specific-to-nondisplaceable uptake) of C-11-ER176 in human brain. Methods: Nine healthy volunteers-3 high-affinity binders (HABs), 3 mixed-affinity binders (MABs), and 3 low-affinity binders (LABs)-were studied with whole body C-11-ER176 PET imaging. SUVs from 60 to 120 min after injection derived from each organ were compared between genotypes. Eight separate healthy volunteers-3 HABs, 3 MABs, and 2 LABs-under-went brain PET imaging. The 3 HABs underwent a repeated brain scan after TSPO blockade with XBD173 (N-benzyl-N-ethyl-2-(7-methyl-8-oxo-2-phenylpurin-9-yl)acetamide) to determine nondisplaceable distribution volume (V-ND) via Lassen occupancy plotting and thereby estimate BPND in brain. Results: Regional SUV averaged from 60 to 120 min after injection in brain and peripheral organs with high TSPO densities such as lung and spleen were greater in HABs than in LABs. On the basis of V-ND determined via the occupancy plot, the whole brain BPND for LABs was estimated to be 1.4 +/- 0.8, which was much lower than that for HABs (4.2 +/- 1.3) but about the same as that for HABs with C-11-PBR28 ([methyl-C-11]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine)) (similar to 1.2). Conclusion: Obvious in vivo sensitivity to rs6971 was observed in C-11-ER176 that had not been expected from in vitro studies, suggesting that the future development of any improved radioligand for TSPO should consider the possibility that in vitro properties will not be reflected in vivo. We also found that C-11-ER176 has adequately high BPND for all rs6971 genotypes. Thus, the new radioligand would likely have greater sensitivity in detecting abnormalities in patients.

Methods: Patients were considered for Y-90-FAPI-46 therapy if they showed both an exhaustion of all approved therapies based on multidisciplinary tumor board decision, and high FAP expression, defined as SUVmax greater than or equal to 10 in more than 50% of all lesions. If tolerated, Y-90-FAPI-46 bremsstrahlung scintigraphy was performed after therapy to confirm systemic distribution and focal tumor uptake, and Y-90-FAPI-46 PET scans were performed at multiple time points to determine absorbed dose. Blood-based dosimetry was used to determine bone marrow absorbed dose. Adverse events were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 5.0). Results: Nine patients either with metastatic soft-tissue or bone sarcoma (n = 6) or with pancreatic cancer (n = 3) were treated between June 2020 and March 2021. Patients received a median of 3.8 GBq (interquartile range [IQR], 3.25-5.40 GBq) for the first cycle, and 3 patients received subsequent cycles with a median of 7.4 GBq (IQR, 7.3-7.5 GBq). Posttreatment Y-90-FAPI-46 bremsstrahlung scintigraphy demonstrated sufficient Y-90-FAPI-46 uptake in tumor lesions in 7 of 9 patients (78%). Mean absorbed dose was 0.52 Gy/GBq (IQR, 0.41-0.65 Gy/GBq) in the kidney, 0.04 Gy/GBq (IQR, 0.03-0.06 Gy/GBq) in bone marrow, and less than 0.26 Gy/GBq in the lung and liver. Measured tumor lesions received up to 2.28 Gy/ GBq (median, 1.28 Gy/GBq). New laboratory G3 or G4 toxicities were noted in 4 patients (44%, n = 2 patients with thrombocytopenia only, n = 2 patients with new onset of thrombocytopenia and anemia). Other G3 or G4 laboratory-based adverse events occurred in 2 patients or fewer. No acute toxicities attributed to Y-90-FAPI-46 were noted. Radiographic disease control was noted in 4 patients (50%). Conclusion: FAP-targeted radioligand therapy with 90Y-FAPI-46 was well tolerated, with a low rate of attributable adverse events. Low radiation doses to at-risk organs suggest feasibility of repeat cycles of Y-90-FAPI-46. We observed signs of tumor response, but further studies are warranted to determine efficacy and the toxicity profile in a larger cohort.

The 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor is of central interest as a target for the treatment of anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. Research on the clinical significance of the 5-HT1A receptor now benefits from the highly selective radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 (WAY) for quantitative determination of 5-HT1A receptors in the primate and human brain in vivo using PET. In this paper, three studies are reviewed to demonstrate the suitability of WAY as radioligand for quantification of central 5-HT1A receptors in brain and as an applicable tool for drug development. In the first study a monkey model was used to characterize WAY binding. It was confirmed that the reference ligand 8-OH-DPAT and psychoactive drugs such as buspirone and pindolol occupies 5-HT1A receptors in the primate brain. Pindolol is an beta-adrenoreceptor antagonist with a high affinity to 5-HT1A receptors. This drug has been suggested in combination with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for the treatment of depression and was given to healthy males in the second study. Pindolol induced a marked inhibition of central 5-HT1A receptors as calculated by the ratio-analysis method and simplified reference tissue model, 2 h after administration of 10 mg as a single oral dose. This observation suggests that pindolol may have a role for the suggested potentiation of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment of depression. The third study was on robalzotan (NAD-299), a recently developed 5-HT1A receptor antagonist and putative drug with implications for the treatment of depression. In the cynomolgus monkey brain, robalzotan in the dose range 2-100 mu g/kg IV occupied 5-HT1A receptors in a dose-dependent and saturable manner with a maximal calculated occupancy of 70-80%. The relationship between robalzotan plasma concentration and 5-HT1A receptor occupancy could be described by a hyperbolic function that was used to guide the selection of appropriate doses in man. In a subsequent PET study of robalzotan binding to 5-HT1A receptors in the living human brain, similar results have been replicated recently. These studies reviewed here illustrate and corroborate that quantitative neuroimaging of receptor binding has potential for the evaluation and dose finding of new central nervous system drugs.

We synthesized the hydroxylated, methoxylated, and chlorinated 11-membered and 12-membered homologues of these 10-membered heterocycles. Their affinities for the human cloned D-1-D-5 receptors (radioligand binding) and functionalities (calcium assay) were measured. Enlarging the dibenzazecines to the corresponding dibenzazacycloundecenes and dibenzazacyclododecenes generally maintains the high antagonistic affinity for D-1/D-5 but also leads to a compound with a clozapine-like binding profile due to additional affinity for D-4.

Radiolabelled transferrin was chosen as a tracer for scintigraphic imaging of the hMSCs transplanted into spinal cord of rabbits. Comparative experiments with radiolabelled human serum albumin as tracer and PBS as graft as well as ex vivo autoradiography demonstrated the specific uptake of radiolabelled transferrin of hMSCs. hMSCs could be detected in vivo with radiolabelled transferrin targeting at cellular transferrin receptors at an early stage after transplantation into spinal cord.

A series of benzo[d] imidazole-quinoline derivatives were designed and synthesized to develop radioiodinated compounds as PDGFR beta-specific imaging probes. The structure activity relationship (SAR) evaluation of the designed compounds was performed. Among them, 2-[5-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl]-8-(piperazin-1-yl) quinoline (5a) and 4-{2-[5-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl]quinolin-8-yl}morpholine (5d) exhibited a relatively high PDGFR beta-TK inhibitory potency, whereas iodinated 5a derivative 5-iodo-2-[5-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1H-benzo[d] imidazol-1-yl]-8-(piperazin-1-yl)quinoline (8) exhibited a superior inhibitory potency as PDGFR beta inhibitor than iodinated 5d derivative 4-{5-iodo-2-[5-(2-methoxyethoxy)-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl] quinolin-8-yl}morpholine (11). Furthermore, [I-125] 8 and [I-125]11 were synthesized and evaluated for PDGFR beta radioligand ability, both in vitro and in vivo. Cellular uptake experiments showed that [I-125]8 had a higher uptake in BxPC3-luc cells as PDGFR beta-positive cells than [I-125]11. Incubation of [I-125]8 after pretreatment of PDGFR beta ligands significantly reduced the uptake of [I-125]8. In biodistribution experiments using tumor-bearing mice, [I-125]8 accumulation in the tumor 1 h postinjection was higher than that of the benzo[d] imidazol-quinoline derivative [I-125]IIQP, used in our previous research. These results indicate that [I-125]8 could be a promising PDGFR beta imaging agent. Although its clinical application requires further structural modifications, the results obtained in this research may be useful for the development of PDGFR beta-specific radioligands.

We hypothesized that disulfide bridges may determine serotonin 5-HT2A receptor functions such as receptor activation, functional selectivity and ligand recognition. We used the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) to determine how the reduction of disulfide bridges affects radioligand binding, second messenger mobilization and receptor dimerization. A DTT-induced decrease in the number of binding sites (1190 +/- 63.55 fmol/mg protein for control cells compared with 921.2 +/- 60.84 fmol/mg protein for DTT-treated cells) as well as in the efficacy of both signalling pathways characterized was observed, although the affinity and potency were unchanged. Bioluminiscence resonance energy transfer (BRET) assays revealed the DTT treatment did not modify the homodimeric nature of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors. In molecular dynamic simulations, the ECL-2 of the receptor with a broken cysteine bond adopts a wider variety of conformations, some of which protrude deeper into the receptor orthosteric binding pocket leading to collapse of the pocket. A shrunken binding pocket would be incapable of accommodating lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Our findings suggest that the decrease of efficacy may be due to disruption of disulfide bridge between TM3 and ECL-2. This reveals the integrity of the ECL-2 epitope, which should be explored in the development of novel ligands acting as allosteric modulators of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors.

The dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor agonist (<i>S</i>)-[<SUP>11</SUP>C]<i>N</i>-methyl-NNC 01-0259 is not sensitive to changes in dopamine concentrationa positron emission tomography examination in the monkey brain	SYNAPSE			English	Article						catecholamines; d-amphetamine; MDL-100907; neurotransmitter; nonhuman primates	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; NONHUMAN PRIMATE BRAIN; IN-VIVO BINDING; HIGH-AFFINITY; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; PET EXAMINATION; C-11 NNC-687; SCH 23390; AMPHETAMINE; RELEASE	Dopamine D-2 receptor positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands have proven useful for indirect assessment of the endogenous dopamine concentration in the living brain. On the contrary, dopamine D-1 receptor antagonist radioligands have shown no sensitivity to changes in the dopamine concentration. A recent approach to enhance the sensitivity of radioligands to the dopamine concentration has been the development of dopamine D-2 receptor agonist radioligands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dopamine sensitivity of a dopamine D-1 receptor agonist radioligand. For this purpose, we developed (S)-[C-11]N-methyl-NNC 01-0259 ((S)-[C-11]1) and characterized the receptor binding of (S)-[C-11]1 using in vitro receptor binding assays and in vivo PET measurements in monkeys. In vitro, both enantiomers of 1 were partial dopamine D-1 receptor agonists, with (S)-1 having a 10-50 times higher affinity than (R)-1. PET studies in monkey confirmed the stereoselectivity of [C-11]1 in vivo. In monkey, administration of the dopamine D-1-like receptor antagonist (R)-(+)-SCH 23390 decreased the striatal binding potential of (S)-[C-11]1 by 97%, but administration of the dopamine concentration enhancer d-amphetamine did not affect (S)-[C-11]1 binding. We conclude that the agonist (S)-[C-11]1 provides specific binding to dopamine D-1-like receptors, possibly representing binding to the high-affinity state of the receptors. The partial dopamine D-1 receptor agonist radioligand has, however, no enhanced sensitivity to endogenous dopamine concentrations in comparison with antagonist radioligands.

Neuroinflammation is associated with increased levels of translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) and binding sites for TSPO ligands. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of TSPO is thus commonly used to monitor neuroinflammation in preclinical and clinical studies. It is widely considered that TSPO PET signal reveals reactive microglia, although a few studies suggested a potential contribution of reactive astrocytes. Because astrocytes and microglia play very different roles, it is crucial to determine whether reactive astrocytes can also overexpress TSPO and yield to a detectable TSPO PET signal in vivo. We used a model of selective astrocyte activation through lentiviral gene transfer of the cytokine ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) into the rat striatum, in the absence of neurodegeneration. CNTF induced an extensive activation of astrocytes, which overexpressed GFAP and become hypertrophic, whereas microglia displayed minimal increase in reactive markers. Two TSPO radioligands,[F-18]DPA-714[N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-[F-18]fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1, 5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide] and [C-11]SSR180575 (7-chloro-N,N-dimethyl-5-[C-11]methyl-4-oxo-3-phenyl-3,5-dihydro-4H-pyridazino[4,5-b] indole-1-acetamide), showed a significant binding in the lenti-CNTF-injected striatum that was saturated and displaced by PK11195[N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-isoquinoline-3-carboxamide]. The volume of radioligand binding matched the GFAP immunopositive volume. TSPO mRNA levels were significantly increased, and TSPO protein was overexpressed by CNTF-activated astrocytes. We show that reactive astrocytes overexpress TSPO, yielding to a significant and selective binding of TSPO radioligands. Therefore, caution must be used when interpreting TSPO PET imaging in animals or patients because reactive astrocytes can contribute to the signal in addition to reactive microglia.

We studied its toxicity in rats and radiation dosimetry in monkeys before human studies are undertaken. Single and multiple-dosage toxicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats. Male and female rats were injected intravenously with 4-F-ADAM as a single dose of 1,023.7 mu g/kg (1,000 times the human dose) or as five consecutive daily doses of 102.37 mu g/kg (100 times the human dose). PET/CT scans were performed in seven Formosa Rock monkeys (four males and three females) using a Siemens Biograph scanner. After injection of 4-[F-18]-ADAM (182 +/- 8 MBq), a low dose CT scan and a series of eight whole-body PET scans were performed. Whole-body images were acquired in 3-D mode. Time-activity data of source organs were used to calculate the residence times and estimate the absorbed radiation dose using OLINDA/EXM software. In the rats neither the single dose nor the five daily doses of 4-F-ADAM produced overt adverse effects clinically. In the monkeys the radiation doses received by most organs ranged between 7.1 and 35.7 mu Gy/MBq, and the urinary bladder was considered to be the critical organ. The effective doses extrapolated to male and female adult humans were 17.4 and 21.8 mu Sv/MBq, respectively. Toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and radiation dosimetry studies in Formosa Rock monkeys suggested that 4-[F-18]-ADAM is safe for use in human PET imaging studies.

In postmortem brain tissue, agonist binding to serotonin-1A receptors is reportedly increased or unchanged in depression or suicide, while neuroimaging studies report a decrease in antagonist binding to these receptors in subjects with depression. In this study, both agonist and antagonist radioligand binding to serotonin-1A receptors were examined in postmortem orbitofrontal cortex from subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). Brain tissue was collected at autopsy from 11 subjects with MDD and 11 age- and gender-matched normal control subjects. Two depressed subjects had a recent psychoactive substance use disorder. Six subjects with MDD had a prescription for an antidepressant drug in the last month of life, and, of these six, postmortem bloods from only two subjects tested positive for an antidepressant drug. There was no significant difference between cohorts for age, postmortem interval or tissue pH. The receptor agonist [H-3]8-OH-DPAT or the antagonist [H-3]MPPF were used to autoradiographically label serotonin-1A receptors in frozen sections from cytoarchitectonically-defined left rostral orbitofrontal cortex (area 47). There was no significant difference between depressed and control subjects in agonist binding to serotonin-1A receptors. However, antagonist binding was significantly decreased in outer layers of orbitofrontal cortex in MDD. This observation in postmortem tissue confirms reports using an antagonist radioligand in living subjects with depression. Decreased antagonist binding to serotonin-1A receptors in outer layers of orbitofrontal cortex suggests diminished receptor signaling and may be linked to corresponding neuronal changes detected previously in these depressed subjects.
