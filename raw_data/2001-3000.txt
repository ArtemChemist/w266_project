Negative and positive allosteric modulators of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X(7) receptor; ATP; BzATP; allosteric modulator; non-competitive antagonist	POTENT ANTAGONIST; POLYMYXIN-B; PAIN; ATP; DISCOVERY; AGONISTS	Background and purpose: Antagonist effects at the P2X(7) receptor are complex with many behaving in a non-competitive manner. In this study, the effects of N-[2-({2-[( 2- hydroxyethyl) amino] ethyl} amino)-5-quinolinyl]-2-tricyclo[3.3.1.1 3,7]dec-1-ylacetamide (compound-17) and N-2-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-N-1-[2-methyl-5-(1-piperazinylmethyl) phenyl] glycinamide dihydrochloride (GW791343) on P2X7 receptors were examined and their mechanism of action explored. Experimental approach: Antagonist effects were studied by measuring agonist-stimulated ethidium accumulation in cells expressing human or rat recombinant P2X7 receptors and in radioligand binding studies. Key results: Compound-17 and GW791343 were non-competitive inhibitors of human P2X7 receptors. Receptor protection studies using decavanadate and pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid (PPADS) showed that neither compound-17 nor GW791343 competitively interacted at the ATP binding site and so were probably negative allosteric modulators of the P2X7 receptor. GW791343 prevented the slowly reversible blockade of the human P2X7 receptor produced by compound-17 and inhibited [H-3]-compound-17 binding to the P2X7 receptor suggesting they may bind to similar or interacting sites. At rat P2X7 receptors, compound-17 was a negative allosteric modulator but the predominant effect of GW791343 was to increase agonist responses. Antagonist interaction and radioligand binding studies revealed that GW791343 did not interact at the ATP binding site but did interact with the compound-17 binding site suggesting that GW791343 is a positive allosteric modulator of the rat P2X7 receptor. Conclusions: Compound-17 was a negative allosteric modulator of human and rat P2X7 receptors. GW791343 was a negative allosteric modulator of the human P2X7 receptor but at the rat P2X7 receptor its predominant effect was positive allosteric modulation. These compounds should provide valuable tools for mechanistic studies on P2X7 receptors.	[Michel, A. D.; Chambers, L. J.; Walter, D.

In contrast to other members of this family, FSRP and follistatin also share a common exon/intron domain structure, substantial primary sequence homology, and an ability to irreversibly bind activin. In this study, we further explored the hypothesis that FSRP is a functional as well as structural homologue of FS. N-terminal sequencing of recombinant FSRP revealed that signal peptide cleavage occurs within exon 1, a significant structural difference from FS, in which cleavage occurs at the exon/intron boundary. Solid-phase radioligand competition assays revealed both FS and FSRP to preferentially bind activin with the next closest TGF-beta superfamily member, bone-morphogenic protein-7, being at least 500-fold less potent. Consistent with their similar activin-binding affinities, FSRP and FS both prevented exogenous (endocrine or paracrine) activin from accessing its receptor and inducing gene transcription in bioassays. However, FS was at least 100-fold more potent than FSRP in inhibiting gene transcription and FSH release mediated by endogenously produced (autocrine) activin-A or activin-B in multiple cell systems. Finally, FSRP lacks the heparin-binding sequence found in FS, and we found that it was also unable to bind cell surface heparin sulfated proteoglycans. These findings suggest that structural differences between FSRP and FS may underlie their different neutralizating capabilities with respect to exogenous vs. endogenous activin. Taken together with our previous studies showing that activin binding is essential for FS's biological activity, the differential activities of FSRP and FS further indicate that activin binding is necessary but not sufficient to account for all of FS's actions.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]AV-1451 PET in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia due to MAPT mutation	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article							TAU PATHOLOGY; DISEASE; BRAIN; HYPOMETABOLISM; DEGENERATION; CRITERIA	The validation of tau radioligands could improve the diagnosis of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and the assessment of disease-modifying therapies. Here, we demonstrate that binding of the tau radioligand [F-18]AV-1451 was significantly abnormal in both magnitude and distribution in a patient with familial frontotemporal dementia due to a MAPT 10 + 16C>T gene mutation, recapitulating the pattern of neuropathology seen in her father. Given the genetic diagnosis and the non-Alzheimer's pathology, these findings suggest that [F-18]AV-1451 might be a useful biomarker in primary tauopathies. Largerscale in vivo and post-mortem studies will be needed to assess the technique's specificity.	[Jones, W.

Endolides A and B, Vasopressin and Serotonin-Receptor Interacting <i>N</i>-Methylated Peptides from the Sponge-Derived Fungus <i>Stachylidium</i> sp.	ORGANIC LETTERS			English	Article							RHIZONIN	The marine-derived fungus Stachylidium sp. was isolated from the sponge Callyspongia sp. cf. C. flammea. Culture on a biomalt medium supplemented with sea salt led to the isolation of two new, most unusual N-methylated peptides, i.e., the tetrapeptides endolide A and B (1 and 2). Both of these contain the very rare amino acid 3-(3-furyl)-alanine. In radioligand binding assays endolide A (1) showed affinity to the vasopressin receptor 1A with a K-i of 7.04 mu M, whereas endolide B (2) exhibited no affinity to the latter receptor, but was selective toward the serotonin receptor 5HT(2b) with a K-i of 0.77 mu M.

The development of a PET (positron emission tomography) tracer able to selectively bind to the NMDARs intra-channel PCP site may make it possible to visualize NMDARs in an open and active state. We describe the in vitro pharmacological characterization of [F-18]-fluoroethylnormemantine ([F-18]-FNM) and evaluate its ability to localize activated NMDA receptors in a rat preclinical model of excitotoxicity.ProceduresThe affinity of the non-radioactive analog for the intra-channel PCP site was determined in a radioligand competition assay using [H-3]TCP ([H-3]N-(1-[thienyl]cyclohexyl)piperidine) on rat brain homogenates. Selectivity was also investigated by the displacement of specific radioligands targeting various cerebral receptors. In vivo brain lesions were performed using stereotaxic quinolinic acid (QA) injections in the left motor area (M1) of seven Sprague Dawley rats. Each rat was imaged with a microPET/CT camera, 40 min after receiving a dose of 30 MBq + / - 20 of [F-18]-FNM, 24 and 72 h after injury. Nine non-injured rats were also imaged using the same protocol.ResultsFNM displayed IC50 value of 13.0 +/- 8.9 mu M in rat forebrain homogenates but also showed significant bindings on opioid receptors. In the frontal and left somatosensory areas, [F-18]FNM PET detected a mean of 37% and 41% increase in [F-18]FNM uptake (p < 0,0001) 24 and 72 h after QA stereotaxic injection, respectively, compared to the control group.ConclusionsIn spite of FNM's poor affinity for NMDAR PCP site, this study supports the ability of this tracer to track massive activation of NMDARs in neurological diseases.

Methods: We studied the pharmacokinetics of F-18-FPEB (3-F-18-fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile), a selective PET radioligand for mGluR5, and used it to quantify mGluR5 in rat brain. Quantification was performed using both arterial sampling in combination with compartment models and simplified reference methods. The simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), Ichise's original multi-linear reference tissue model (MRTMO), and Logan noninvasive were tested as reference models with nondisplaceable binding (BPND) as outcome parameter. Additionally, test-retest scans were obtained in 6 animals. Results: F-18-FPEB uptake in rat brain was consistent with its known distribution. No radiometabolites were present in the brain, and binding was specific as shown in blocking experiments, which also confirmed the cerebellum as a viable reference region. A 2-tissue-compartment model was used to determine BPND for the striatum (11.7 +/- 1.5), nucleus accumbens (10.6 +/- 2.0), hippocampus (9.0 +/- 1.2), cortex (7.2 +/- 1.0), and thalamus (4.0 +/- 0.9). Reference methods were able to estimate these values with small bias (<2%). Test-retest analysis showed high repeatability between scans below 6%, also for shorter scan durations of 30 and 60 min. Conclusion: Because of its favorable reversible kinetics, high specificity, and absence of brain radiometabolites F-18-FPEB proves a highly useful tracer for in vivo visualization of the mGluR5 in rat brain. Moreover, reference tissue models allow noninvasive, rapid scanning with good test-retest.

Methods: Radioligand binding assays were performed using rat brain and spleen membrane preparations. CB1 and CB2 receptor redistribution and intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) assays were performed with IN CELL Analyzer. Inverse agonism was studied using intracellular cAMP assays, and in guinea-pig ileum and mouse vas deferens smooth muscle preparations. In vivo pharmacologic profile was assessed in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Results: In radioligand binding assay, MJ08 selectively antagonized CB1 receptor (IC50=99.9 nmol/L). In EGFP-CB1_U2OS cells, its IC50 value against CB1 receptor activation was 30.23 nmol/L (SR141716A: 32.16 nmol/L). WIN 55,212-2 (1 mu mol/L) increased [Ca2+](i) in the primary cultured hippocampal neuronal cells and decreased cAMP accumulation in CHO-hCB(1) cells. MJ08 (10 nmol/L-10 mu mol/L) blocked both the WIN 55,212-2-induced effects. Furthermore, MJ08 reversed the inhibition of electrically evoked twitches of mouse vas deferens by WIN 55,212-2 (pA(2)=10.29 +/- 1.05). MJ08 and SR141716A both showed an inverse agonism activity by markedly promoting the contraction force and frequency of guinea pig ileum muscle. MJ08 significantly increased the cAMP level in CHO-hCB(1) cells with an EC50 value of 78.6 nmol/L, which was lower than the EC50 value for SR141716A (159.2 nmol/L). Besides the more potent pharmacological effects of cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonism in DIO mice, such as reducing food intake, decreasing body weight, and ameliorating dyslipidemia, MJ08 (10 mg/kg) unexpectedly raised the fasted blood glucose in vivo. Conclusion: MJ08 is a novel, potent and selective CB1 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist with potent bioactive responses in vitro and in vivo that may be useful for disclosure the versatile nature of CB1 receptors.

Sensitivity to MK-801 in phospholipase C-β1 knockout mice reveals a specific NMDA receptor deficit	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Environmental enrichment; hippocampus; phospholipase C-beta 1; psychotomimetic; schizophrenia	LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT; STRUCTURAL-CHANGES; NEURONAL PATTERNS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ANTAGONIST; CORTEX; PLASTICITY; DIFFERENTIATION; INVOLVEMENT	Phospholipase C-beta 1 (PLC-beta 1) is a critical component of multiple signalling pathways downstream Of neurotransmitter receptors. Mice lacking this enzyme display a striking behavioural phenotype with relevance to human psychiatric disease. Glutamatergic dysfunction is strongly associated with several abnormal behavioural states and may underlie part of the phenotype of the phospholipase C-beta 1 knockout (KO) Mouse. A heightened response to glutamatergic psychotomimetic drugs is a critical psychosis-related endophenotype, and in this study it was employed as a correlate Of glutamatergic dysfunction. Control (n=8) and PLC-beta 1 KO mice (n=6) were treated with MK-801, a NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, following either standard housing or environmental enrichment, and the motor function and locomotor activity thus evoked was assessed. In addition, MK-801 binding to the NMDAR was evaluated through radioligand autoradiography in post-mortem tissue (on a drug-naive cohort). We have demonstrated a significantly increased sensitivity to the effects of the NMDA antagonist MK-801 in the PLC-beta 1 KO mouse. In addition, WC found that this mouse line displays reduced hippocampal NMIDAR expression, as measured by radioligand binding. We previously documented a reversal of specific phenotypes in this mouse line following housing in an enriched environment. Enrichment did not alter this heightened MK-801 response, nor NMDAR expression, indicating that this therapeutic intervention works on specific pathways only. These findings demonstrate the critical role of the glutamatergic system in the phenotype of the PLC-beta 1 KO mouse and highlight the role of these interconnected signalling pathways in schizophrenia-like behavioural disruption. These results also shed further light on the capacity of environmental factors to modulate subsets of these phenotypes.

Several requirements are necessary for a potential PET radioligand for visualization of a receptor into the brain: i) high affinity and selectivity for the target receptor; ii) suitable lipophilicity for both blood-brain barrier permeation and low nonspecific binding to proteins and lipids; iii) structural features that allow labelling with a positron emission isotope. In this study the synthesis and binding affinities for dopamine D-3 and D-2 receptors of several N-[4-(4-arylpiperazin-1-yl) butyl] arylcarboxamides are reported. These compounds were designed by the structural modification of the formerly reported D3 receptor ligand N-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl) piperazin-1-yl] butyl]-7-methoxy-2-benzofurancarboxamide ( 1), with the aim to obtain a suitable lipophilicity and the structural features for labelling. In particular, both the 2,3-dichlorophenyl group and the 7-methoxy-2-benzofurancarboxamide moiety were replaced by less lipophilic fragments. Among the studied compounds, derivatives N-[4-[4-(5-methoxy-2-benzisoxazolyl) piperazin-1-yl] butyl]-4-(4-morpholinyl) benzamide (20), N-[4-[4-(5-methoxy-2-benzisoxazolyl) piperazin-1-yl] butyl]-4-(1-Himidazol-1- yl) benzamide (21), and N-[4-[4-(5-methoxy-2-benzisoxazolyl) piperazin-1-yl] butyl]-5-( 2-furanyl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (22) displayed good D-3 receptor affinities (K-i values 38, 22.6, and 21.3 nM, respectively) and were found to be inactive at D-2 receptor. Moreover, on the basis of their experimental log P values and their ability to cross the Caco-2 monolayer, compounds 20-22 are likely to permeate the blood-brain barrier, differently from compound 1.

The affinity of this compound was also compared with other 5-HT2-selective antagonists such as ketanserin, sarpogrelate, cyproheptadine and ritanserin, and the results showed that AT-1015 has a high pK(i) value for the 5-HT2 receptor. The rank order of these antagonists are: ritanserin > ketanserin congruent to AT-1015 > cyproheptadine congruent to sarpogrelate. We also evaluated the dissociation ability (slow or rapid) of AT-1015 in the rabbit cerebral cortex membrane and compared it with other 5-HT2 antagonists using the radioligand binding assay method. The blockade of [H-3]ketanserin binding, sites in the rabbit cerebral cortex induced by ketanserin and sarpogrelate was readily reversed by washing, whereas the inhibition by AT-1015, cyproheptadine and ritanserin was not readily reversed by washing. The % of control after washing are 76.10% and 49.55% for AT-1015 at 10(-7.5) and 10(-7.0) M, 67.32% and 50.17% for cyproheptadine at 10(-7.5) and 10(-7.0) M, and 72.38% and 39.80% for ritanserin at 10(-9.5) and 10(-9.0) M concentrations, respectively. Thus, these findings suggest that AT-1015 has antagonistic properties towards the 5-HT2 receptor and also shows that AT-1015 slowly dissociates from the 5-HT2 receptor, whereas, ketanserin and sarpogrelate dissociate rapidly from the 5-HT2 receptor, which do not correlate with their affinity.

Compounds were synthesized and radioligand binding affinity assays were performed. Eight novel benzimidazoles exhibited affinity for the CB1 receptor in the nanomolar range, and the most promising derivative compound 5 displayed a K-i value of 1.2 nM when compared to CP55,940. These results confirm our previously reported QSAR model on benzimidazole derivatives, providing new information for the development of small molecules with high CB1 affinity.

The majority of known ligands may cause undesirable side-effects, except tetrapeptide rapastinel which demonstrated rapid antidepressant effect without psychotomimetic side effects. High shape similarity was noticed between dipeptide Phe-Tyr and NMDA receptor non-competitive antagonist ifenprodil which imply the possibility for antagonistic action of this peptide. A series of analogs were selected based on the docking results and molecular dynamics simulations. A dipeptide D-Phe-L-Tyr showed modest inhibitory activity comparable to rapastinel.	[Karlov, D.

The use of the exciting and attractive properties of radioisotopes for imaging and therapy has made Nuclear Medicine very significant when it comes to molecular imaging/therapy. Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs) on the other hand are very important targeting biomolecules with high affinity that can "carry" the radioisotope of choice. Herein we make a brief overview of the radiolabeled mAbs that target prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and their use in the management of patients with prostate cancer (PCa).

Amide-to-triazole switch vs. in vivo NEP-inhibition approaches to promote radiopeptide targeting of GRPR-positive tumors	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Tumor targeting; GRPR-radioligand; Lu-177-bombesin; Triazolyl-bombesin; NEP-inhibition	PEPTIDE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; BOMBESIN-LIKE PEPTIDES; PROSTATE-CANCER; ANALOGS	Introduction: Radiolabeled bombesin (BBN)-analogs have been proposed for diagnosis and therapy of gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-expressing tumors, such as prostate, breast and lung cancer. Metabolic stability represents a crucial factor for the success of this approach by ensuring sufficient delivery of circulating radioligand to tumor sites. The amide-to-triazole switch on the backbone of DOTA-PEG(4)-[Nle(14)]BBN(7-14) (1) was reported to improve the in vitro stability of resulting Lu-177-radioligands. On the other hand, in-situ inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) by coinjection of phosphoramidon (PA) was shown to significantly improve the in vivo stability and tumor uptake of biodegradable radiopeptides. We herein compare the impact of the two methods on the bioavailability and localization of Lu-177-DOTA-PEG(4)-[Nle(14)]BBN(7-14) analogs in GRPR-positive tumors in mice. Methods: The 1,4-disubstituted [1-3]-triazole was used to replace one (2: Gly(11)-His(12); 3: Ala(9)-Val(10)) or two (4: Ala(9)-Val(10) and Gly(11)-His(12)) peptide bonds in 1 (reference) and all compounds were labeled with 177Lu. Each of [177Lu]1-[177Lu]4 was injected without (control) or with PA in healthy mice. Blood samples collected 5 min post-injection (pi) were analyzed by HPLC. Biodistribution of [Lu-177]1-[Lu-177]4 was conducted in SCID mice bearing human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 xenografts at 4 h pi. Groups of 4 animals were injected with radioligand, alone (controls), or with coinjection of PA, or of a mixture of PA and excess and [Tyr(4)]BBN to determine GRPR-specificity of uptake (Block). Results: The in vivo stability of the radioligands was: [Lu-177]1 (25% intact), [Lu-177]2 (45% intact), [Lu-171]3 (30% intact) and [Lu-177]4 (40% intact). By PA-coinjection these values notably increased to 90%-93%. Moreover, treatment with PA induced an impressive and GRPR-specific uptake of all radioligands in the PC -3 xenografts at 4 h pi: [Lu-171]1: 4.7 +/- 0.4 to 24.8 +/- 4.9%ID/g; [Lu-177]2: 8.3 +/- 1.2 to 26.0 +/- 1.1%ID/g; [Lu-177]3: 6.6 +/- 0.4 to 21.3 +/- 4.4%ID/g; and [Lu-177]4: 4.8 +/- 1.6 to 13.7 +/- 3.8%ID/g. Conclusions: This study has shown that amide-to-triazole substitutions in Lu-177-DOTA-PEG(4)-[Nle(14)]BBN(7-14) induced minor effects on bioavailability and tumor uptake in mice models, whereas in-situ NEP-inhibition(s) by PA impressively improved in vivo profiles.

In a search for new 5-HT1A antagonists with different pharmacokinetic and metabolic properties, the pyridinyl X-oxide moiety was incorporated into analogs of 1 and 2. NOWAY 3, in which the pyridinyl ring of I was oxidized to the pyridinyl X-oxide. was prepared via nucleophilic substitution of 2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethylamine on 2-chloropyridine-N-oxide followed by acylation with cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride. 6Cl-NOWAY 4. a more lipophilic (pyridinyl-6)-chloro derivative of 3. was prepared by treating 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-(2-(2 -(6-bromo)aminopyridinyl-N-oxide)ethyl)piperazine with cyclohexanecarbonyl chloride for acylation and concomitant chloro for bromo substitution. NEWWAY 5. in which the 2-hydroxy-phenyl group of 2 is replaced with a 2-pyridinyl N-oxide group with the intention of mimicking the topology of 2. was prepared in five steps from 2-(chloroacetylamino)pyridine. AI-Oxides 3-5 were found to be high affinity antagonists at 5-HT1A receptors, with 3 having the highest affinity and a K-i value (0.22 nM) comparable to that of 1 (0.17 nM). By calculation the lipophilicity of 3 (Log,P = 1.87) is lower than that of 1 by 1.25 Log P units while TLC and reverse phase H PLC indicate that 3 has slightly lower lipophilicity than 1. On the basis of these encouraging findings, the N-oxide 3 was selected for labeling with carbon-l I in its carbonyl group and for evaluation as a radioligand with PET. After intravenous injection of [carbonyl-C-11 ]3 into cynomolgus monkey there was very low uptake of radioactivity into brain and no PET image of brain 5-HT1A receptors was obtained. Either 3 inadequately penetrates the blood-brain barrier or it is excluded from brain by an active efflux mechanism. Rapid deacylation or 3 was not apparent in vivo: in cynomolgus monkey plasma radioactive metabolites of [carbonyl-C-11]3 appeared less rapidly than from the radioligands [carbonyl-C-11]1 and [carbonyl-C-11]2, which are known to be primarily metabolized by deacylation. Ligand 3 may have value as a new pharmacological tool, but not as a radioligand for brain imaging. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, many reports have highlighted PSMA radioligand uptake in a variety of benign tumors and lesions. We report a case of PCa in which (68) Ga-PSMA-11 uptake was noted in the tracheal lumen. However, F-18-PSMA-1007 PET/CT was done on a subsequent day, which demonstrated no abnormal radiotracer uptake or morphological lesion within the tracheal lumen. This case highlights an uncommon finding of PSMA ligand uptake in a tracheal mucus plug (non-prostatic benign uptake), which may be misinterpreted as a false-positive finding.

To study the structure activity relationships of this new chemical series for adenosine receptors, a library of 24 purines was synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assays at human A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) adenosine receptor subtypes. Fourteen molecules showed potent antagonism at A(1), A(3) or dual A(1)/A(3) adenosine receptors. This purine scaffold is an important source for novel biochemical tools and/or therapeutic drugs.

However, the [H-3]muscimol binding sites derived from these subunits were not affected. Thus, chronic ethanol causes the down-regulation of the benzodiazepine sites derived from the alpha(2)-, alpha(3)- and gamma(2)-subunits without affecting the GABA binding sites.

Correlation and factor analysis of behavioral data showed that the indices of exploratory behavior and anxiety in a novel context were rather independent from each other. The densities of NMDA receptors (B (max), fmol/mg of protein) in the hippocampus and benzodiazepine receptors in the prefrontal cortex were higher in C57BL/6 mice. Our data demonstrate the opportunity for selective pharmacological regulation of cognitive behavior and anxiety using nootropic and anxiolytic drugs.	[Kovalev, G. I.; Kondrakhin, E. A.; Salimov, R.

Radioligand binding assays of this series of compounds as well as a previously synthesized series of 17 structurally-similar compounds showed that six systems have very high affinities to the 5-HT1A receptor (0.3-1.0 nM) and good selectivity against the 5-HT2A receptor. Molecular docking, structural studies and structure-activity relationship studies were used to gain more insight into the atomistic details of ligand binding and rationalize the obtained results.

All three compounds interact with binding sites of specific GABA-A and, in particular, GABA-B receptor ligands. Racemate and S-enantiomer, but not its R-form, competed to a moderate degree for D2-receptor binding sites. In all cases, degrees of interaction with receptors were ranged as follows: S-isomer>racemate>R-isomer. These qualitative and quantitative differences are assumed to contribute to pharmacological activity of both drugs.	[Kovalev, G.

These compounds resulted from a blended approach based firstly on the use of an alternative substructure embedded within asperlicin and secondly on the derivatization of this template with substituents chosen considering the C-terminal primary structure of the endogenous ligand. Although these compounds exhibited a regnylogical-type organization similar to that of CCK-4, they are characterized by about 1000-fold greater affinity for CCK-A receptor than the C-terminal tetrapeptide.

Yet, as these experiments were routinely carried out in the presence of chelators, only the catalytic zinc-depleted apo-form of IRAP was labelled. While the chelators remove the catalytic zinc from IRAP and protect Ang IV from proteolytic degradation, the aminopeptidase N selective inhibitor 7B only exerts the latter effect. By using 7B along with the new stable Ang IV-analog [3H]AL-11, we here show that the native enzyme is only a low-affinity target for Ang IV.

One important mechanism of streptomycin modification is through ATP-dependent O-adenylation, catalyzed by streptomycin adenylyltransferase. Initial velocity patterns deduced from steady state kinetics indicate a sequential mechanism. Dead-end inhibition by tobramycin and neomycin is non-competitive versus streptomycin and uncompetitive versus ATP, indicative of ordered substrate binding where ATP binds first and then streptomycin. These results surmise that streptomycin adenylyltransferase follows an ordered, sequential kinetic mechanism in which one substrate (ATP) binds prior to the antibiotic and pyrophosphate is released prior to formation of AMP-streptomycin.

Other S1P receptor modulators have been approved for the treatment of MS or are in clinical development for MS or UC, but it is unknown whether these compounds bind competitively with each other to S1P(1) or S1P(5). We developed a competitive radioligand binding assay using tritiated ozanimod and demonstrate full displacement of ozanimod by S1P (endogenous ligand), suggesting that ozanimod binds to the S1P(1) and S1P(5) orthosteric binding sites. S1P receptor modulators FTY720-p, siponimod, etrasimod, ponesimod, KRP-203-p, and amiselimod-p also completely displacing radiolabeled ozanimod; thus, on a macroscopic level, all bind to the same site. Molecular docking studies support these results and predict the binding of each molecule to the orthosteric site of the receptors, creating similar interactions within S1P(1) and S1P(5). The absolute free energy perturbation method further validated key proposed binding modes. Functional potency tightly aligned with binding affinities across S1P(1) and S1P(5) and all compounds elicited S1P(1)-mediated beta-arrestin recruitment. Since all the S1P modulators included in this study display similar receptor pharmacology and compete for binding at the same site, they can be considered interchangeable with one another. The choice of any one particular agent should therefore be made on the basis of overall therapeutic profile, and patients can be offered the opportunity to switch S1P medications without the potential concern of additive S1P pharmacology.

VMAT2 availability in Parkinson's disease with probable REM sleep behaviour disorder	MOLECULAR BRAIN			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; REM sleep behaviour disorder; Positron emission tomography; VMAT2; [C-11]DTBZ	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOPAMINE; PET; BINDING; TRANSPORTERS; DYSFUNCTION; TERMINALS; DIAGNOSIS; DEMENTIA; VESICLES	REM sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) can be an early non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) with pathology involving mainly the pontine nuclei. Beyond the brainstem, it is unclear if RBD patients comorbid with PD have more affected striatal dopamine denervation compared to PD patients unaffected by RBD (PD-RBD-). To elucidate this, we evaluated the availability of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), an index of nigrostriatal dopamine innervation, in 15 PD patients with probable RBD (PD-RBD+), 15 PD-RBD-, and 15 age-matched healthy controls (HC) using [C-11]DTBZ PET imaging. This technique measured VMAT2 availability within striatal regions of interest (ROI). A mixed effect model was used to compare the radioligand binding of VMAT2 between the three groups for each striatal ROI, while co-varying for sex, cognitive function and depression scores. Multiple regressions were also computed to predict clinical measures from group condition and VMAT2 binding within all ROIs explored. We observed a significant main effect of group condition on VMAT2 availability within the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamus. Specifically, our results revealed that PD-RBD+ had lower VMAT2 availability compared to HC in all these regions except for the subthalamus and substantia nigra, while PD-RBD- was significantly lower than HC in all these regions. PD-RBD- showed a negative relationship between motor severity and VMAT2 availability within the left caudate. Our findings reflect that both PD patient subgroups had similar denervation within the nigrostriatal pathway. There were no significant interactions detected between radioligand binding and clinical scores in PD-RBD+. Taken together, VMAT2 and striatal dopamine denervation in general may not be a significant contributor to the pathophysiology of RBD in PD patients. Future studies are encouraged to explore other underlying neural chemistry mechanisms contributing to RBD in PD patients.

A Novel Radioligand Reveals Tissue Specific Pharmacological Modulation of Glucocorticoid Receptor Expression with Positron Emission Tomography	ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN; RADIOFLUORINATION; SUBSTITUTION; LIGAND	The complexity of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling cannot be measured with direct tissue analysis in living subjects, which has stifled our understanding of GR's role in human physiology or disease and impeded the development of selective GR modulators. Herein, we report F-18-5-(4-fluorobenzyi)-10-methoxy-2,2,4-trimethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-chromeno [3,4-f]-quinoline (F-18-YJHO8), a radioligand that enables noninvasive measurements of tissue autonomous GR expression levels in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). YJHO8 potently binds GR (K-i similar to 0.4 nM) with similar to 100-fold selectivity compared to nuclear hormone receptors in the same subfamily. F-18-YJHO8 was prepared via Cu(OTf)(2)(py)(4)-mediated radiofluorination of an arylboronic acid pinacol ester with similar to 12% decay corrected radiochemical yield from the starting F-18-fluoride ion. We applied treatment with the tissue-wide GR agonist dexamethasone and adrenalectomy and generated an adipocyte specific GR knockout mouse to show that( 18)F-YJHO8 specifically binds GR in normal mouse tissues, including those for which aberrant GR expression is thought to drive severe diseases (e.g., brain, adipose tissue, kidneys). Remarkably, F-18-YJHO8 PET also revealed that JG231, a potent and bioavailable HSP70 inhibitor, selectively degrades GR only in the adipose tissue of mice, a finding that foreshadows how GR targeted PET might be integrated into drug discovery to screen for selective GR modulation at the tissue level, beyond the historical screening that was performed at the transcriptional level. In summary, F-18-YJHO8 enables a quantitative assessment of GR expression levels in real time among multiple tissues simultaneously, and this technology is a first step toward unraveling the daunting complexity of GR signaling and rationally engineering tissue specific therapeutic modulators in vivo.

First-in-human evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PS13, a novel PET radioligand, to quantify cyclooxygenase-1 in the brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Cyclooxygenase-1; Positron emission tomography; Inflammation; Test-retest reliability; Neuroimaging	MICROGLIA; REPRODUCIBILITY; EXPRESSION; BINDING; ATLAS; BLOOD	Purpose This study assessed whether the newly developed PET radioligand [C-11]PS13, which has shown excellent in vivo selectivity in previous animal studies, could be used to quantify constitutive levels of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) in healthy human brain. Methods Brain test-retest scans with concurrent arterial blood samples were obtained in 10 healthy individuals. The one- and unconstrained two-tissue compartment models, as well as the Logan graphical analysis were compared, and test-retest reliability and time-stability of total distribution volume (V-T) were assessed. Correlation analyses were conducted between brain regional V-T and COX-1 transcript levels provided in the Allen Human Brain Atlas. Results In the brain, [C-11]PS13 showed highest uptake in the hippocampus and occipital cortex. The pericentral cortex also showed relatively higher uptake compared with adjacent neocortices. The two-tissue compartment model showed the best fit in all the brain regions, and the results from the Logan graphical analysis were consistent with those from the two-tissue compartment model. V-T values showed excellent test-retest variability (range 6.0-8.5%) and good reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient range 0.74-0.87). V-T values also showed excellent time-stability in all brain regions, confirming that there was no radiometabolite accumulation and that shorter scans were still able to reliably measure V-T. Significant correlation was observed between V-T and COX-1 transcript levels (r = 0.82, P = 0.007), indicating that [C-11]PS13 binding reflects actual COX-1 density in the human brain. Conclusions These results from the first-in-human evaluation of the ability of [C-11]PS13 to image COX-1 in the brain justifies extending the study to disease populations with neuroinflammation.

Blockade of Cocaine or σ Receptor Agonist Self Administration by Subtype-Selective σ Receptor Antagonists	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; PGRMC1 PROTEIN; HIGH-AFFINITY; DOPAMINE; RATS; BINDING; LIGANDS; INHIBITION; ANALOGS	The identification of sigma receptor (sigma R) subtypes has been based on radioligand binding and, despite progress with sigma R-1 cellular function, less is known about sigma R subtype functions in vivo. Recent findings that cocaine self administration experience will trigger sigma R agonist self administration was used in this study to assess the in vivo receptor subtype specificity of the agonists (+)-pentazocine, PRE-084 [2-(4-morpholinethyl) 1-phenylcyclohexanecarboxylate hydrochloride], and 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and several novel putative sigma R antagonists. Radioligand binding studies determined in vitro sigma R selectivity of the novel compounds, which were subsequently studied for self administration and antagonism of cocaine, (+)-pentazocine, PRE-084, or DTG self administration. Across the dose ranges studied, none of the novel compounds were self administered, nor did they alter cocaine self administration. All compounds blocked DTG self administration, with a subset also blocking (+)-pentazocine and PRE-084 self administration. The most selective of the compounds in binding sigma 1Rs blocked cocaine self administration when combined with a dopamine transport inhibitor, either methylphenidate or nomifensine. These drug combinations did not decrease rates of responding maintained by food reinforcement. In contrast, the most selective of the compounds in binding sigma 2Rs had no effect on cocaine self administration in combination with either dopamine transport inhibitor. Thus, these results identify subtype-specific in vivo antagonists, and the utility of sigma R agonist substitution for cocaine self administration as an assay capable of distinguishing sigma R subtype selectivity in vivo. These results further suggest that effectiveness of dual sigma R antagonism and dopamine transport inhibition in blocking cocaine self administration is specific for sigma 1Rs and further support this dual targeting approach to development of cocaine antagonists.

Identification of α<sub>1L</sub>-adrenoceptor in mice and its abolition by α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor gene knockout	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor; alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor; vas deferens; prostate; cerebral cortex; knockout mouse	ALPHA-1-ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; INTERNATIONAL UNION; RECEPTOR SUBTYPE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HUMAN PROSTATE; RABBIT; ANTAGONIST; ADRENOCEPTOR	Background and purpose: The alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor has pharmacological properties that distinguish it from three classical alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (alpha(1A), alpha(1B) and alpha(1D)). The purpose of this was to identify alpha(1L)-adrenoceptors in mice and to examine their relationship to classical alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Experimental approach: Radioligand binding and functional bioassay experiments were performed on the cerebral cortex, vas deferens and prostate of wild-type (WT) and alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor gene knockout (AKO, BKO and DKO) mice. Key results: The radioligand [H-3]-silodosin bound to intact segments of the cerebral cortex, vas deferens and prostate of WT, BKO and DKO but not of AKO mice. The binding sites were composed of two components with high and low affinities for prazosin or RS-17053, indicating the pharmacological profiles of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors and alpha(1L)-adrenoceptors. In membrane preparations of WT mouse cortex, however, [H-3]-silodosin bound to a single population of prazosin high-affinity sites, suggesting the presence of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors alone. In contrast, [H-3]-prazosin bound to two components having alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor profiles in intact segments of WT and DKO mouse cortices, but AKO mice lacked alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor profiles and BKO mice lacked alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor profiles. Noradrenaline produced contractions through alpha(1L)-adrenoceptors with low affinity for prazosin in the vas deferens and prostate of WT, BKO and DKO mice. However, the contractions were abolished or markedly attenuated in AKO mice. Conclusions and implications: alpha(1L)-Adrenoceptors were identified as binding and functional entities in WT, BKO and DKO mice but not in AKO mice, suggesting that the alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor is one phenotype derived from the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor gene.

Quantification of α4β2*nicotinic receptors in the rat brain with microPET® and 2-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]F-A-85380	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; PET DATA; QUANTITATION; INFUSION; HUMANS; TOXICITY	The radioligand 2-[F]F-A-85380 has been used for PET studies of the alpha 4 beta 2* subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the living brain of humans and nonhuman primates. In order to extend the capacity of microPET to quantify neuroreceptors in rat brain, we carried out studies of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 to measure the apparent binding potential BP* in individual rats, which were studied repeatedly over several months. Using a bolus-plus-infusion paradigm, 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 (specific activity 20-1300 GBq/mu mol) was administered intravenously over 8 to 9 h with K-bol values of 350 to 440 min and a mean infusion rate of 0.03 +/- 0.01 nmol/kg/h. Studies included a 2-h nicotine infusion initiated 2 h before the end of scanning to displace specifically bound radioactivity. Steady state binding in brain was obtained within 5 h as defined by the occurrence of constant radioactivity concentrations in brain regions and constant, free arterial plasma levels of nonmetabolized radioligand. BP* averages ( SEM) for thalamus, forebrain, and cerebellum were 5.9 +/- 0.7, 2.6 +/- 0.4, and 1.0 +/- 0.1, respectively, which are consistent with the alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR distribution in rat brain measured in vitro. Studies of receptor occupancy determined the ED50 to be 0.29 nmol/kg/h. The demonstration that alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs are quantifiable in the rat brain using PET measurements, coupled with the ability to conduct longitudinal studies over several months in the same rats, suggests potential applications to studies of chronic nicotine use, its treatment, and abnormal functioning of alpha 4 beta 2* receptors in a rat model.

J	Stevens, CW				Stevens, CW			Opioid research in amphibians: an alternative pain model yielding insights on the evolution of opioid receptors	BRAIN RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Article						bioinformatics; analgesia; selectivity; domain	MORPHINE-INDUCED ANALGESIA; SUBSTANCE P-LIKE; SPINAL-CORD; ADRENERGIC AGENTS; BINDING-SITES; DELTA-OPIOIDS; KAPPA-OPIOIDS; MERKEL CELLS; RANA-PIPIENS; FROG BRAIN	This review summarizes the work from our laboratory investigating mechanisms of opioid analgesia using the Northern grass frog, Rana pipiens. Over the last dozen years, we have accumulated data on the characterization of behavioral effects after opioid administration on radioligand binding by using opioid agonist and antagonist ligands in amphibian brain and spinal cord homogenates, and by cloning and sequencing opioid-like receptor cDNA from amphibian central nervous system (CNS) tissues. The relative analgesic potency of mu, delta, and kappa opioids is highly correlated between frogs and other mammals, including humans. Radioligand binding studies using selective opioid agonists show a similar selectivity profile in amphibians and mammals. In contrast, opioid antagonists that are highly selective for mammalian mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were not selective in behavioral and binding studies in amphibians. Three opioid-like receptor cDNAs were cloned and sequenced from amphibian brain tissues and are orthologs to mammalian mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors. Bioinformatics analysis of the three types of opioid receptor cDNAs from all vertebrate species with full datasets gave a pattern of the molecular evolution of opioid receptors marked by the divergence of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor sequences during vertebrate evolution. This divergence in receptor amino acid sequence in later-evolved vertebrates underlies the hypothesis that opioid receptors are more type-selective in mammals than in nonmammalian vertebrates. The apparent order of receptor type evolution is kappa, then delta, and, most recently, the mu opioid receptor. Finally, novel bioinformatics analyses suggest that conserved extracellular receptor domains determine the type selectivity of vertebrate opioid receptors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The histamine system and cognitive function: An in vivo H3 receptor PET imaging study in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; schizophrenia; cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia; histamine 3 receptor; executive function	H-3 RECEPTOR; RAT-BRAIN; DOPAMINE D-1; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; MEDIATED INHIBITION; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; WORKING-MEMORY; RELEASE	Background: The histamine-3 receptor (H3R) is an auto- and heteroreceptor that inhibits the release of histamine and other neurotransmitters. Post-mortem evidence has found altered H3R expression in patients with psychotic disorders, which may underlie cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). Aims: We used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to compare brain uptake of an H3R selective tracer between patients with schizophrenia and matched controls (healthy individuals). Regions of interest included the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and striatum. We explored correlations between tracer uptake and symptoms, including cognitive domains. Methods: A total of 12 patients and 12 matched controls were recruited to the study and were assessed with psychiatric and cognitive rating scales. They received a PET scan using the H3R-specific radioligand [C-11]MK-8278 to determine H3R availability. Results: There was no statistically significant difference in tracer uptake between patients and controls in the DLPFC (t(19) = 0.79, p = 0.44) or striatum (t(21) = 1.18, p = 0.25). An exploratory analysis found evidence for lower volume of distribution in the left cuneus (p(FWE-corrected) = 0.01). DLPFC tracer uptake was strongly correlated with cognition in controls (trail making test (TMT) A: r = 0.77, p = 0.006; TMT B: rho = 0.74, p = 0.01), but not in patients (TMT A: r = -0.18, p = 0.62; TMT B: rho = -0.06, p = 0.81). Conclusions: These findings indicate H3R in the DLPFC might play a role in executive function and this is disrupted in schizophrenia in the absence of major alterations in H3R availability as assessed using a selective radiotracer for H3R. This provides further evidence for the role of H3R in CIAS.

Methods Thirty patients pathologically diagnosed with ACC were recruited into the cohort. Each patient underwent (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and F-18-FDG PET/CT within 1 week. The number and SUVmax of PET-positive lesions were recorded and compared. Four patients accepted RLT using Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617, in a dosage of approximately 1.85 GBq (50 mCi) per cycle for up to 3 cycles. Results Compared with F-18-FDG, (68) Ga-PSMA-617 revealed more PET-positive extrapulmonary tumors (157 vs. 141, P = 0.016) and higher SUVmax (8.8 +/- 3.6 vs. 6.4 +/- 4.2, P = 0.027). However, (68) Ga-PSMA-617 revealed less PET-positive pulmonary lesions (202 vs. 301, P < 0.001) and lower SUVmax of tumors (3.1 +/- 3.0 vs. 4.2 +/- 3.9, P < 0.001) than F-18-FDG. The combination of (68) Ga-PSMA-617 and F-18-FDG can detect 469 PET-positive lesions, which was superior to each alone (469 vs. 359 vs. 442, P < 0.001). Two patients achieved remarkable response after PSMA RLT, while the other two patients showed reduced tumor uptake of recurrent foci, lung and liver metastases, whereas increased SUVmax of bone metastases. Conclusions (68) Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT is a valuable imaging modality for the detection of ACC and combining with F-18-FDG PET/CT will achieve a higher detection efficiency. PSMA RLT may be a promising treatment for ACC and is worth of further investigation. .

Inverse changes in raphe and cortical 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor availability after acute tryptophan depletion in healthy human subjects	SYNAPSE			English	Article						5-HT1B receptor; [C-11]P943; acute tryptophan depletion; binding potential; positron emission tomography; serotonin	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; ENDOGENOUS SEROTONIN; HUMAN BRAIN; BINDING; PET; PLASMA; ACID; RADIOLIGAND; SENSITIVITY	Serotonergic neurotransmission plays a key role in the pathophysiology and treatment of various neuropsychiatric diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in serotonergic neurotransmission after acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) using positron emission tomography (PET) with [C-11]P943, a 5-HT1B receptor radioligand previously shown to be sensitive to changes in 5-HT. Five healthy subjects were scanned on a high resolution PET scanner twice on the same day, before and approximately 5 hours after ingesting capsules containing an amino acid mixture that lacks tryptophan. For each scan, emission data were acquired for 120 min after intravenous bolus injection of [C-11]P943. Binding potential (BPND) values were estimated from parametric images using the second version of the multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM2, t* = 20 min) with cerebellar grey matter used as a reference region. The change in [C-11]P943 binding (Delta BPND, %) was calculated as (BPND,post - BPND,pre)/(BPND,pre) x 100, and correlation analysis was performed to measure linear associations of Delta BPND between raphe and other regions of interest (ROIs). Delta BPND ranged from -6% to 45% in the raphe, with positive values indicating reduced competition from 5-HT. In cortical regions, Delta BPND ranged from -28% to 7%. While these changes did not reach significance, there were significant negative correlations of Delta BPND of the raphe with those of cerebral cortical regions and the thalamus (e.g., r = -.96, p = .011 for average cortex). These findings support the hypothesis that raphe serotonin is a critical modulator of cortical serotonin release via projecting neurons in healthy human subjects.

In vivo assessment of neuroinflammation in progressive multiple sclerosis: a proof of concept study with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]DPA714 PET	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						[F-18]DPA714; Multiple sclerosis; Neuroinflammation; Positron emission tomography; TSPO	WHITE-MATTER; HUMAN BRAIN; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BINDING; QUANTIFICATION; INFLAMMATION; DPA-714; IMPACT; LIGAND	BackgroundOver the past decades, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become an increasingly useful research modality in the field of multiple sclerosis (MS) research, as PET can visualise molecular processes, such as neuroinflammation, in vivo. The second generation PET radioligand [F-18]DPA714 binds with high affinity to the 18-kDa translocator-protein (TSPO), which is mainly expressed on activated microglia. The aim of this proof of concept study was to evaluate this in vivo marker of neuroinflammation in primary and secondary progressive MS.MethodsAll subjects were genotyped for the rs6971 polymorphism within the TSPO gene, and low-affinity binders were excluded from participation in this study. Eight patients with progressive MS and seven age and genetic binding status matched healthy controls underwent a 60min dynamic PET scan using [F-18]DPA714, including both continuous on-line and manual arterial blood sampling to obtain metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input functions.ResultsThe optimal model for quantification of [F-18]DPA714 kinetics was a reversible two-tissue compartment model with additional blood volume parameter. For genetic high-affinity binders, a clear increase in binding potential was observed in patients with MS compared with age-matched controls. For both high and medium affinity binders, a further increase in binding potential was observed in T2 white matter lesions compared with non-lesional white matter. Volume of distribution, however, did not differentiate patients from healthy controls, as the large non-displaceable compartment of [F-18]DPA714 masks its relatively small specific signal.ConclusionThe TSPO radioligand [F-18]DPA714 can reliably identify increased focal and diffuse neuroinflammation in progressive MS when using plasma input-derived binding potential, but observed differences were predominantly visible in high-affinity binders.

This arises from activation of the AT(1) Ang II receptor subtype. Acute repeated injections, however, decrease the water intake response to Ang II without affecting saline intake. Previous studies provide evidence that Ang II-induced water intake is mediated via the classical G protein coupling pathway, whereas the saline intake caused by Ang II is mediated by an ERK 1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway. Accordingly, the different behavioral response to repeated injections of Ang II may reflect a selective effect on G protein coupling. To test this hypothesis, we examined the binding of a radiolabeled agonist (I-125-sarcosine(1) Ang II) and a radiolabeled antagonist (I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) Ang II) in brain homogenates and tissue sections prepared from rats given repeated injections of Ang II or vehicle. Although no treatment-related differences were found in hypothalamic homogenates, a focus on specific brain structures using receptor autoradiography, found that the desensitization treatment reduced binding of both radioligands in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) and median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), but not in the subfomical organ (SFO). Because G protein coupling is reported to have a selective effect on agonist binding without affecting antagonist binding, these findings do not support a G protein uncoupling treatment effect. This suggests that receptor number is more critical to the water intake response than the saline intake response, or that pathways downstream from the G protein mediate desensitization of the water intake response.

In order to study the in vivo functional correlates of this MRI finding, we used 11C-PK11195 PET (PK-PET) to investigate changes in microglial activity. Ten relapsing and 9 progressive MS subjects had a PK-PET scan and a MRI scan alongside a full clinical assessment, including the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) for evaluation of disability. We studied the PK binding potential of the specifically bound radioligand relative to the non-displaceable radioligand in tissue (BPND) in T1 BHs. Out of a total of 1242 BHs identified, 947 were PK enhancing. The PKBPND was correlated with the EDSS (r = 0.818; p < 0.05) only in the progressive group. In the relapsing patients there was an inverse correlation between PKBPND and BH total lesion volume in whole brain (r = -0.781; p < 0.05). When progressive patients were grouped according to the disability outcome at 2 years from the PK-PET scan, the total PKBPND in BHs was found to be a significant outcome predictor of disability (p < 0.01). Our findings show that relapsing and progressive patients have heterogeneous patterns of PKBPND in T1 BHs and indicate that BHs are not just "holes" representing loss of axons and myelin, but display inflammatory activity in the form of activated microglia. The significant association between PKBPND, neurological impairment and outcome in progressive subjects supports a role for activated microglia in disability progression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Fasitibant prevents the bradykinin and interleukin 1β synergism on prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> release and cyclooxygenase 2 expression in human fibroblast-like synoviocytes	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Bradykinin; B-2 receptor; Cyclooxygenase; Fasitibant; Interleukin 1 beta; Kinin; Knee; MEN16132; Osteoarthritis; Synovium	HUMAN SYNOVIAL FIBROBLASTS; B-2 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; NF-KAPPA-B; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; COX-2 EXPRESSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; OSTEOARTHRITIS; MEN16132	This study investigates the effect of the selective and potent B-2 receptor antagonist fasitibant (MEN16132) on the proinflammatory effect of bradykinin (BK) and its interaction with interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) in human synoviocytes. PGE(2) content was detected in the surnatants and COX-2 and COX-1 gene and protein expression determined in the cells. Radioligand binding ([(3) H]BK) and BK-induced inositolphosphate experiments were performed. Incubation of synoviocytes with BK induced a sustained production of PGE(2) and transient COX-2 gene expression that were prevented by pretreatment with fasitibant (1 mu M, 30 min preincubation). IL-1 beta increased PGE(2) release and COX-2 expression more than BK alone. The combined treatment of cells with BK and IL-1 beta induced an even increase of released PGE(2) and COX-2 gene and protein expression indicating a synergistic rather than an additive effect, not related to an increase of B-2 receptors density or its coupling. These potentiating effects of BK on PGE(2) production and increased COX-2 expression produced by IL-1 beta were B-2-receptor-mediated as fasitibant could prevent them. None of the treatments induced changes in the COX-1 expression. The synergistic PGE(2) production was abolished by the specific NF-kappaB inhibitor (BAY-117085), whereas specific inhibitors for the p38 (SB203580), JNK (SP600125), and ERK1/2 (PD98059) mitogen-activated protein kinases could prevent the prostanoid release. BK can potentiate the COX-2 gene expression and consequent prostanoid production induced by IL-1 beta. The prevention of this synergism by fasitibant indicates BK B-2 receptor blockade as an alternative symptomatic therapy for osteoarthritis.

(Marsileaceae) has been referred in Indian traditional medicine system (Ayurveda) for the treatment of insomnia and other mental disorders. Marsiline isolated from Marsilea minuta was reported to have sedative and anticonvulsant property. The ethanol extract of Marsilea minuta was standardised for marsiline (1.15%, w/w) and studied for its antidepressant activity. Materials and methods: Antidepressant activity was studied using forced swimming test (FST), tail suspension test (TST), learned helplessness test (LHT) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) induced head twitches response in rodents. Standardised extract of Marsilea minuta in doses of 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg/day were administered orally for three consecutive days and evaluated on day 3, 1 It after the last dose treatment. Imipramine (15 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was used as the standard drug. Neurochemical mechanism of antidepressant activity was elucidated by using radioligand receptor binding assays for 5-HT2A and benzodiazepine receptors in rat frontal cortex. Results: Immobility time in FST and TST was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by ethanol extract of Marsilea minuta treated animals. A decrease in number of escape failures in LHT was also observed in Marsilea minuta treated rats. Head twitch response induced by 5-HTP was significantly attenuated by Marsilea minuta (400 mg/kg, p.o.) and imipramine showing the involvement of serotonergic system. This effect was corroborated with radioligand receptor binding study where Marsilea minuta (400 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly (P<0.05) down regulated 5-HT2A receptor in frontal cortex, whereas, no marked effect was observed for benzodiazepine receptor. Conclusion: The antidepressant effect exhibited by Marsilea minuta extract may be due to its effect on 5-HT2A density in rat frontal cortex. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The hyperglycaemic effect of FT005 (1 mg kg(-1)) was significantly reduced by the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist rauwolscine (0.5 mg kg(-1)). 3 FT005 produced a significant reduction in plasma insulin levels of mice 30 min after administration. The hyperglycaemic effect of FT005 (25 mg kg(-1)), although still present, was significantly less in fasted mice in which insulin levels are lower, suggesting that a reduction of insulin secretion contributes to the action of FT005. 4 When studied in the mouse isolated vas deferens preparation, FT005 produced a complete inhibition of neurogenic contractions, which was blocked by rauwolscine. This is consistent with activation of pre-synaptic alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. 5 In radioligand binding studies FT005 completely displaced the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist [H-3]-RX821002 from mouse whole brain homogenates. The displacement was best described by a two-site model of interaction comprising high and low affinity components. 6 The results indicate that FT005 is an agonist at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. A reduction in insulin secretion contributes to the hyperglycaemic action of FT005, although an additional mechanism can not be excluded.

In this study, we identify human airway smooth muscle (ASM) as a direct target of adenosine. Acute exposure of human ASM cultures to adenosine receptor (AR) agonists resulted in rapid accumulation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with a pharmacologic profile consistent with A(2b)AR activation. Little or no evidence of A1AR or A3AR expression was suggested on acute addition of various AR ligands, although a low level of A1ARs was identified in radioligand binding studies. Treatment with adenosine deaminase suggested that human ASM cultures secrete adenosine that feeds back on A(2b)ARs and regulates basal cAMP levels as well as a small degree of A(2b)AR, beta (2)AR, and prostaglandin E-2 receptor desensitization. When subjected to chronic treatment with AR agonists or agents that enhance accumulation of endogenous, extracellular adenosine, a dual effect of A(2b)AR desensitization and adenylyl cyclase (AC) sensitization was observed. This AC sensitization was eliminated by pertussis toxin and partially reversed by the A1AR antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, suggesting a contributory role for the A1AR. Overexpression of A1ARs and A(2b)ARs in human ASM cultures resulted in differential effects on basal, agonist-, and AC-mediated cAMP production. These data demonstrate that human ASM is a direct target of exogenous and autocrine adenosine, with effects determined by differential contributions of A(2b) and A1 adenosine receptors that are time-dependent. Accordingly, the relative distribution and activation of AR subtypes in ASM in vivo may influence airway function in diseases such as asthma and warrant consideration in therapeutic strategies that target ARs or alter nucleotide/ nucleoside levels in the airway.

Response and Toxicity to the Second Course of 3 Cycles of <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA Therapy Every 4 Weeks in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer	CANCERS			English	Article						PSMA-RLT; Lu-177-PSMA; PSA; mCRPC; prostate cancer	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; PSMA; EXPERIENCE; PREDICTORS	Simple Summary The [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) has emerged as a successful treatment option in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Nevertheless, the therapeutic protocol of this treatment is still heterogeneous in many centers, in terms of the number of cycles and the interval between the cycles. Recently, we published the clinical impact of a homogeneous PSMA-RLT protocol that has been applied in our clinic since we started offering this treatment to patients with mCRPC. The outcomes were supportive and promising for analyzing the efficacy and toxicity of using the same treatment regimen in patients who benefited from the first treatment course. Based on the results, we concluded that a second course of three cycles of standardized PSMA-RLT with only a 4-week interval between the cycles is safe and offers favorable tolerability, response rates, overall survival, and progression-free survival, rendering it a promising alternative for the retreatment of mCRPC patients who have formerly responded well to PSMA-RLT. Background: We investigated the response rate and degree of toxicity of a second course of three cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) every 4 weeks in mCRPC patients. Methods: Forty-three men (71.5 +/- 6.6 years, median PSA 40.8 (0.87-1358 mu g/L)) were studied. The response was based on the PSA level 4 weeks after the third cycle. The laboratory parameters before and one month after the last cycle were compared. Kaplan-Meier methods were used to estimate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and the Cox regression model was performed to find predictors of survival. Results: Twenty-six patients (60.5%) exhibited a PSA reduction (median PSA declined from 40.8 to 20.2, range 0.6-1926 mu g/L, p = 0.002); 18 (42%) and 8 (19%) patients showed a PSA decline of >= 50% and >= 80%, respectively. The median OS and PFS were 136 and 31 weeks, respectively. The patients with only lymph node metastases survived longer (p = 0.02), whereas the patients with bone metastases had a shorter survival (p = 0.03). In the multivariate analysis, only the levels of PSA prior to the therapy remained significant for OS (p < 0.05, hazard ratio 2.43, 95% CI 1.01-5.87). The levels of hemoglobin (11.5 +/- 1.7 g/dL vs. 11 +/- 1.6 g/dL, p = 0.006) and platelets (208 +/- 63 g/L vs. 185 +/- 63 g/L, p = 0.002) significantly decreased one month after cycle three, though only two grade 3 anemia and one grade 3 thrombocytopenia were recorded. Conclusion: A further intensive PSMA-RLT course is well tolerated in mCRPC patients and associated with promising response rates and OS.

The immunogen was prepared by coupling I to the bovine serum albumin via the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of I from which the radioligand was also prepared by the reaction with [I-125]-iodotyrosine. The method was specific and no immunoactive material other than the parent drug was detectable in mammalian plasma. This direct assay, using 50 mul of rat plasma is sensitive (0.4 ng/ml), without matrix interference, and has sufficient sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision for the analysis of dosed rat plasma samples.

In this study, patterns of distribution and absolute quantities of beta-adrenoceptor subtypes beta(1) and beta(2) were determined in membranes of equine lung parenchyma, bronchial and tracheal epithelium with the underlying smooth muscle by saturation and competition binding assays using the radioligand (-)-[I-125]- iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). Additionally, the functional coupling of beta-adrenoceptors to G-proteins (assessed by P-agonist competition binding in the presence and absence of GTP) as well as the coupling efficiency and biochemical activities of AC was investigated in each region. The specific ICYP binding was rapid, reversible, saturable with time and of high affinity. The radioligand binding identified more total beta-adrenoceptors in the lung than in bronchus or trachea (428 +/- 19, 162.4 +/- 4.8, 75.6 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein, respectively) with about 40% of receptors in the high affinity state. The beta(2)-adrenoceptor subtype predominated in all segments (approximately 74-80%), as the highly selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 was about 10,000 times more potent in inhibiting ICYP binding than was the P I selective adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A, and beta-adrenoceptor agonists inhibited ICYP binding with an order of potency: (-)-isoprenaline > (-)-adrenaline > (-)-noradrenaline. The dissociation constant (K-d) was higher in the trachea than in bronchus or lung (13.0 +/- 0.9 pM vs. 20.0 +/- 2.3 pM vs. 30.8 +/- 4.4 pM, P < 0.05, respectively). The beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated AC response was tissue-dependent; stimulants acting on beta-adrenoceptor (isoproterenot), G-protein (GTP, NaF) and AC (forskolin, Mn2+) enhanced AC responses in all three regions, but the AC activity was higher in tracheal crude membranes than in bronchus or lung (trachea much greater than bronchus > lung), hence, the number of beta(2)-adrenoceptors correlated inversely with the amount of AC. We conclude that (1) the stoichiometry of components within the pulmonary P-adrenoceptor-G-protein complex is segment-dependent, and (2) the receptor number or AC activity is possibly the rate-limiting factor in the beta-adrenoceptor-G-protein-AC-mediated physiological responses. Thus, it is speculated that this could have important therapeutic consequences in P-adrenoceptor agonist-induced receptor regulation in bronchial asthma. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

K(D)s of 1*, 2* and 3* were 0.4, 2.2 and 15 nM and nonspecific binding was 5. 40 and 50% of total binding. Striatal uptake of 2* in mice was similar to 0.2% ID/g 60 min post-injection; blocking by 2 was insignificant. Poor penetration of the blood brain barrier and high nonspecific binding make 2* unsuitable for imaging striatal receptors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To evaluate the suitability of novel receptor ligands, frequently elaborate, time-consuming, and expensive receptor-ligand interaction studies have to be carried out. This work describes the development and proof of principle of a rapid, sensitive, and reliable receptor-ligand binding assay. CHO cells were stably transfected with a construct encoding the human A(1)adenosine receptor (hA(1)AR). For ligand binding assays, membranes from these cells were prepared and embedded in low melting point agarose. These "immobilized" samples were incubated with tritiated 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine ([H-3]DPCPX), a well-established receptor antagonist. TheK(D)andB(max)values as well as kinetic parameters (k(on)andk(off)) of receptor-ligand interaction were determined. Unspecific binding of various radiotracers to either the carrier material or the agarose gel matrix was negligible. The dissociation constant (K-D) for [H-3]DPCPX at the hA(1)AR was determined by saturation, competition binding, and kinetic experiments. These studies resulted inK(D)values of similar to 3 nM, which is in good accordance with previously published data obtained from conventional receptor-ligand binding assays. The procedure described in this study simplifies classical binding studies to a kit-like assay. The receptors retained their binding properties even when preparations were dried completely. Transport and delivery of the material are conceivable without loss of biological activity. Therefore, other laboratories can perform binding studies without special equipment or the necessity to run a cell culture laboratory and/or to dissect tissue on their own.

Valbenazine (NBI-98854), a novel compound that selectively inhibits VMAT2, is approved for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia. Valbenazine is converted to two significant circulating metabolites in vivo, namely, (+)- dihydrotetrabenazine (R, R, R-HTBZ) and a mono-oxy metabolite, NBI-136110. Radioligand-binding studies were conducted to assess and compare valbenazine, tetrabenazine, and their respective metabolites in their abilities to selectively and potently inhibit [H-3]-HTBZ binding to VMAT2 in rat striatal, rat forebrain, and human platelet homogenates. A broad panel screen was conducted to evaluate possible off-target interactions of valbenazine, R, R, R-HTBZ, and NBI-136110 at >80 receptor, transporter, and ion channel sites. Radioligand binding showed R, R, R-HTBZ to be a potent VMAT2 inhibitor in homogenates of rat striatum (K-i = 1.0-2.8 nM), rat forebrain (K-i = 4.2 nM), and human platelets (K-i = 2.6-3.3 nM). Valbenazine (K-i = 110-190 nM) and NBI-136110 (K-i = 160-220 nM) also exhibited inhibitory effects on VMAT2, but with lower potency than R, R, R-HTBZ. Neither valbenazine, R, R, R-HTBZ, nor NBI-136110 had significant off-target interactions at serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B) or dopamine (D-1 or D-2) receptor sites. In vivo studies measuring ptosis and prolactin secretion in the rat confirmed the specific and dose-dependent interactions of tetrabenazine and R, R, R-HTBZ with VMAT2. Evaluations of potency and selectivity of tetrabenazine and its pharmacologically active metabolites were also performed. Overall, the pharmacologic characteristics of valbenazine appear consistent with the favorable efficacy and tolerability findings of recent clinical studies [KINECT 2 (NCT01733121), KINECT 3 (NCT02274558)].

It is involved in the regulation of cytoplasmic levels of cAMP and cGMP and signaling within the basal ganglia. This study with PDE10A radioligand [F-18]MNI-659 was designed to measure the enzyme occupancy of PF-02545920 in 8 healthy male volunteers (48 +/- 4 years) after a single oral dose (10 mg or 20 mg) and to evaluate safety and tolerability. Arterial blood sampling was performed to obtain a metabolite-corrected plasma input function for the quantification of [18F]MNI-659 binding to PDE10A. The occupancy of PF-02545920 was calculated with two different methods: In Method 1, [18F]MNI-659 enzyme occupancy was calculated from the estimates of binding potential, using the cerebellum as a reference region; in Method 2, occupancy was estimated from the slope of the revised Lassen's plot. Serum concentrations of PF-02545920 were measured to determine the relationship between concentration and occupancy. Based on Method 1, striatal PDE10A occupancy increased with increasing PF-02545920 dose: 14-27% at 10 mg dose (N = 4) and 45-63% at 20 mg dose (N = 3). Comparable occupancies were observed using Lassen's plot Method 2: 10 mg: 14-37%; 20 mg: 46-55%. The relationship between exposure and occupancy was best described using an Emax model. The serum concentration associated with 50% occupancy was estimated to be 93.2 ng/mL. Single oral doses of 10 mg or 20 mg of PF-02545920 were safe and well tolerated in healthy male volunteers [NCT# 01918202]. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We aimed to evaluate dosimetry, safety and efficacy of Lu-177-PSMA- 617 radioligand therapy (RLT) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Fifteen patients each received two cycles of 3.7 GBq (n = 5) or 6.0 GBq (n = 10) 177Lu-PSMA-617 at an eight to ten weeks interval. For safety monitoring, each treatment was followed by dosimetry with serial quantitative SPECT as well as inpatient and outpatient recording of adverse events. Response to RLT was primarily determined by baseline to follow-up change in Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT (RECIST1.1), as well as change in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), quality of life (QoL, FACT-P scale), and pain (Brief Pain Inventory) as secondary endpoints. Radiation dose delivered to the tumor (6.1 Gy/GBq) was six to twelve-fold higher than to critical organs (kidney left/right 0.5/0.6 Gy/GBq each, salivary glands 1.0 Gy/GBq). Total radiation dose per kidney did not exceed 23 Gy in any patient. Three patients had sub-acute and latent grade 3 events, i.e. anemia, leukocytopenia, and nausea. No acute events, grade >= 4 events or high grade events for salivary gland or kidney function were observed. After two RLT cycles, 4 (27%) patients had partial response, 6 (40%) had stable disease, and 5 (33%) had progressive disease according to RECIST.

High doses of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) decrease serotonin receptor availability in monkey brain, consistent with increased serotonin concentrations. However, two recent studies on healthy human subjects, using a single, lower and clinically relevant SSRI dose, showed increased cortical serotonin receptor radioligand binding, suggesting potential decreases in serotonin concentration in projection regions when initiating treatment. The cross-species differential SSRI effect may be partly explained by serotonin transporter (SERT) occupancy in monkey brain being higher than is clinically relevant. We here determine SERT occupancy after single doses of escitalopram or citalopram by conducting PET measurements with [C-11]MADAM in monkeys. Relationships between dose, plasma concentration and SERT occupancy were estimated by one-site binding analyses. Binding affinity was expressed as dose (ID50) or plasma concentration (K (i)) where 50 % SERT occupancy was achieved. Estimated ID50 and K (i) values were 0.020 mg/kg and 9.6 nmol/L for escitalopram and 0.059 mg/kg and 9.7 nmol/L for citalopram, respectively. Obtained K (i) values are comparable to values reported in humans. Escitalopram or citalopram doses nearly saturated SERT in previous monkey studies which examined serotonin sensitivity of receptor radioligands. PET-measured cross-species differential effects of SSRI on cortical serotonin concentration may thus be related to SSRI dose. Future monkey studies using SSRI doses inducing clinically relevant SERT occupancy may further illuminate the delayed onset of SSRI therapeutic effects.

The Antimalarial Drug Proguanil Is an Antagonist at 5-HT<sub>3</sub> Receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							HUMAN 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(3) RECEPTOR; CONCENTRATION-RESPONSE RELATIONSHIPS; SINGLE DOSE PHARMACOKINETICS; META-CHLOROPHENYLBIGUANIDE; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; LIGAND RECOGNITION; BINDING; AGONIST; LOOP; CHLOROQUINE	Proguanil is an antimalarial prodrug that is metabolized to 4-chlorophenyl-1-biguanide (CPB) and the active metabolite cycloguanil (CG). These compounds are structurally related to meta-chlorophenyl biguanide (mCPBG), a 5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor agonist. Here we examine the effects of proguanil and its metabolites on the electrophysiology and ligand-binding properties of human 5-HT(3)A receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and human embryonic kidney 293 cells, respectively. 5-HT3 receptor responses were reversibly inhibited by proguanil, with an IC50 of 1.81 mu M. Competitive antagonism was shown by a lack of voltage-dependence, Schild plot (K-b = 1.70 mu M), and radioligand competition (K-i = 2.61 mu M) with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist [H-3] granisetron. Kinetic measurements (k(on) - 4.0 x 10(4) M-1 s(-1); k(off) - 0.23 s(-1)) were consistent with a simple bimolecular reaction scheme with a K-b of 4.35 mu M. The metabolites CG and CPB similarly inhibited 5-HT3 receptors as assessed by IC50 (1.48 and 4.36 mu M, respectively), Schild plot (K-b = 2.97 and 11.4 mu M), and radioligand competition (K-i = 4.89 and 0.41 mu M). At higher concentrations, CPB was a partial agonist (EC50 = 14.1 mu M; I/I-max = 0.013). These results demonstrate that proguanil competitively inhibits 5-HT3 receptors, with an IC50 that exceeds whole-blood concentrations following its oral administration. They may therefore be responsible for the occasional gastrointestinal side effects, nausea, and vomiting reported following its use. Clinical development of related compounds should therefore consider effects at 5-HT3 receptors as an early indication of possible unwanted gastrointestinal side effects.

After initial successful clinical studies with [ DTPA(0), DGlu(1)] minigastrin ( DTPAMG0) radiolabelled with In-111 and Y-90, our group developed a Tc-99m- labelled radioligand, based on HYNIC- MG0. A major drawback observed with these derivatives is their high uptake by the kidneys. In this study we describe the preclinical evaluation of the optimised shortened peptide analogue, [ HYNIC0, DGlu(1), desGlu(2-6)] minigastrin ( HYNIC- MG11). Methods Tc-99m labelling of HYNIC- MG11 was performed using tricine and EDDA as coligands. Stability experiments were carried out by reversed phase HPLC analysis in PBS, PBS/ cysteine and plasma as well as rat liver and kidney homogenates. Receptor binding and cell uptake experiments were performed using AR4- 2J rat pancreatic tumour cells. Animal biodistribution was studied in AR4- 2J tumour- bearing nude mice. Results Radiolabelling was performed at high specific activities and radiochemical purity was > 90%. Tc-99m- EDDA-HYNIC-MG11 showed high affinity for the CCK- 2 receptor and cell internalisation comparable to that of Tc-99m- EDDA-HYNIC-MG0. Despite high stability in solution, a low metabolic stability in rat tissue homogenates was found. In a nude mouse tumour model, very low unspecific retention in most organs, rapid renal excretion with reduced renal retention and high tumour uptake were observed. Conclusion Tc-99m- EDDA- HYNIC- MG11 shows advantages over Tc-99m- EDDA- HYNIC- MG0 in terms of lower kidney retention with unchanged uptake in tumours and CCK- 2 receptor- positive tissue. However, the lower metabolic stability and impurities formed in the labelling process still leave room for further improvement.

Postmortem CNS studies suggest that levels of serotonin receptors may be altered in the cortex of subjects with schizophrenia. Seeking to expand this hypothesis we have examined the effect of schizophrenia and antipsychotic drug treatments on the levels of cortical serotonin(7), (1D) and (1F) receptors. There was a significant decrease in the binding of [H-3]SB 269970 to the serotonin(7) receptor in Brodmann's area 9 from subjects with schizophrenia compared to controls (Mean +/- S.E.M.: 8.3 +/- 0.76 vs. 11.0 +/- 0.64 fmol/mg ETE; p < 0.05) and an increase in the binding of that radioligand in the cortex of rats treated with haloperidol (p=0.03). There were no significant differences in [H-3]sumatriptan binding to the serotonin(1D) or serotonin(1F) receptor in Brodmann's area 9 from subjects with schizophrenia. There was a significant increase in [H-3]sumatriptan binding to the serotonin(1D) in binding Layer 2 from subjects who had potentially died by suicide that was not present in other binding layers or for the serotonin(1F) or serotonin(7) receptors. There was decrease in [H-3]sumatriptan binding to the serotonin(1D), but not serotonin(1F), receptors across all cortical binding layers in rats treated with haloperidol. These data would be consistent with the hypothesis that decreased levels of serotonin(7) receptors in Brodmann's area 9 may be involved in the pathological processes of schizophrenia and that levels of cortical serotonin(7) and (1D) receptors can be affected by antipsychotic drug treatment.

Methods: Radioligand binding techniques were used to compare the specific binding properties of [H-3]P1075 and [H-3]glibenclamide (Gli) in normotensive (NWR) and reno-vascular hypertensive rat (RVHR) aortic strips. Results: The K-D values of [H-3]P1075 binding were increased by 1.5-fold, while the B-max values were unchanged in RVHR. The IC50 values of P1075 and pinacidil (Pin) for displacing the [H-3]P1075 binding in RVHR were increased by 1.8- and 1.7-fold, respectively. The kinetic processes of association and dissociation of [H-3]P1075 binding were slower in RVHR. Glibenclamide pretreatment slowed down the kinetic processes of the association and dissociation of [H-3]P1075 binding in NWR, but failed to alter the kinetic processes of [H-3]P1075 binding in RVHR. The IC50 values of Gli for displacing the [H-3]Gli binding at high-affinity sites were increased by 3-fold, while those at low-affinity sites remained to be unchanged in RVHR. The kinetic processes of association of [H-3]Gli binding were decreased and those of the dissociation were accelerated in RVHR. The treatment with Pin slowed down the association kinetic processes but accelerated the process of the dissociation of [H-3]Gli binding in NWR, but did not alter the kinetics of [H-3]Gli binding in RVHR. Conclusion: The affinity of binding sites for [H-3]P1075 and of high-affinity binding sites for [H-3]Gli are decreased, and the negative allosteric interactions between the two binding sites are impaired in RVHR aorta.

Our goal was to assess, in vivo, the extent and regional distribution of brain ER occupancy in rats chronically exposed to 17beta-estradiol (E-2) or tamoxifen (TAM). For that purpose, female ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with subcutaneous pellets containing either placebo (OVX), E-2, or TAM for 3 weeks. ER occupancy in grossly dissected regions was quantified with 16alpha-[F-18]fluoroestradiol ([F-18]FES). Both E-2 and TAM produced significant decreases in radioligand uptake in the brain although the effect of E-2 was larger and more widespread than the effect of TAM. Detailed regional analysis of the interaction was then undertaken using a radioiodinated ligand, 11beta-methoxy-16alpha-[I-125]iodo-estradiol ([I-125]MIE2), and quantitative ex vivo autoradiography. E2 treatment resulted in near-complete (86.6 +/- 17.5%) inhibition of radioligand accumulation throughout the brain, while ER occupancy in the TAM group showed a marked regional distribution such that percentage inhibition ranged from 40.5 +/- 15.6 in the ventrolateral part of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus to 84.6 +/- 4.5 in the cortical amygdala. These results show that exposure to pharmacologically relevant levels of TAM produces a variable, region-specific pattern of brain ER occupancy, which may be influenced by the regional proportion of ER receptor subtypes. These findings may partially explain the highly variable and region-specific effects observed in neurochemical, metabolic, and functional studies of the effects of TAM in the brain of experimental animals as well as human subjects.

Their potencies agree with those deduced indirectly by their modulation of the equilibrium binding and kinetics of [H-3] N-methylscopolamine ([H-3] NMS) binding to the orthosteric site. The affinities and cooperativities of orthosteric antagonists with [H-3] dimethyl-W84 have also been quantitated. These affinities agree with those measured directly in a competition assay using [H-3] NMS. All these data are compatible with the predictions of the allosteric ternary complex model. The association and dissociation kinetics of [H-3] dimethyl-W84 are rapid but the estimate of its association rate constant is nevertheless comparable with that found for the orthosteric radioligand, [H-3] NMS. This is unexpected, given that the allosteric site to which [H-3] dimethyl-W84 binds is thought to be located on the external face of the receptor and above the [H-3] NMS binding site that is buried within the transmembrane helices. The atypical allosteric ligands tacrine and 4,4'-bis-[(2,6-dichloro-benzyloxy-imino)methyl]- 1,1'-propane-1,3-diyl-bis-pyridinium dibromide (Duo3) inhibit [H-3] dimethyl-W84 binding with the same potencies and comparably steep slope factors as found for inhibition of [H-3] NMS binding. Tacrine and Duo3 decrease [H-3] dimethyl-W84 affinity, not the number of binding sites. It is suggested that these atypical ligands either bind to the two known spatially separated allosteric sites on muscarinic receptors with positive cooperativity or their binding to the common allosteric site modulates receptor-receptor interactions such that homotropic positive cooperativity within a dimer or higher oligomer is generated.

ET-1 (1 nM-1 mu M) caused a tetrodotoxin-insensitive contraction in both longitudinal and circular muscles, but the longitudinal muscle was more sensitive to ET-1 than was the circular muscle. On the other hand, ET-3 and sarafotoxin S6c were Less effective to cause a contractile response. The contraction induced by ET-1 was markedly inhibited by BQ123 and FR139317, but BQ788 only slightly inhibited the response induced by ET-1. The radioligand binding study indicated the presence of a single class of T-125-ET-1 binding sites with the same K-d value in both muscle layers. However, Bmax in the longitudinal muscle (3252 fmol/mg protein) was significantly higher than that in the circular muscle (1883 fmol/mg protein). ET-1 and FR139317 inhibited the specific I-125-ET-1 binding completely, but ET-3, sarafotoxin S6c and BQ3020 only slightly inhibited the specific binding (inhibition, 10-20%), suggesting that ETA is the dominant ET receptor subtype in the porcine myometrium. The results of the molecular study indicated the expression of both ETA and ETB receptor-coding genes in the porcine myometrium. In conclusion, ET-1 causes contraction of the porcine myometrium through activation of the ETA receptor present on smooth muscle cells. There is a marked muscle layer-related difference (longitudinal muscle > circular muscle) in the ET-1induced contraction and the ETA receptor concentration. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

Discovery of Highly Potent Adenosine A<sub>1</sub> Receptor Agonists: Targeting Positron Emission Tomography Probes	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Adenosine receptors; central nervous system; blood-brain barrier; PET imaging; multiparameter optimization; A(1) antagonists	PET; BRAIN; SYSTEM	Adenosine receptor (AR) radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) have provided knowledge on the in vivo biodistribution of ARs in the central nervous system (CNS), which is of therapeutic interest for various neuropsychiatric disorders. Additionally, radioligands that can image changes in endogenous adenosine levels in different physiological and pathological conditions are still lacking. The binding of known antagonist adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R) radiotracer, [C-11]MDPX, failed to be inhibited by elevated endogenous adenosine in a rodent PET study. Since most of the known AR PET radiotracers were antagonists, we propose that an A(1)R agonist radioligand may possess higher sensitivity to measure changes in endogenous adenosine concentration. Herein, we report our latest findings toward the development of a full agonist adenosine A(1) radioligand for PET. Based on a 3,5-dicyanopyridine template, 16 new derivatives were designed and synthesized to optimize both binding affinity and functional activity, resulting in two full agonists (compounds 27 and 29) with single-digit nanomolar affinities and good subtype selectivity (A(1)/A(2A) selectivity of similar to 1000-fold for compound 27 and 29-fold for compound 29). Rapid O-[C-11]methylation provided [C-11]27 and [C-11] 29 in high radiochemical yields and radiochemical purity. However, subsequent brain PET imaging in rodents showed poor brain permeability for both radioligands. An in vivo PET study using knockout mice for MDR 1a/a, BCRP, and MRP1 indicated that these compounds might be substrates for brain efflux pumps. In addition, in silico evaluation using multiparameter optimization identified high molecular weight and high polar surface area as the main molecular descriptors responsible for low brain penetration. These results will provide further insight toward development of full agonist adenosine A(1) radioligands and also highly potent CNS A(1)AR drugs.

One explanation could be that the allergic inflammatory state includes activation of immune cells in the brain, but this hypothesis has not been tested in humans. The aim of the present study was therefore to investigate seasonal changes in the glial cell marker translocator protein (TSPO), and to relate this to peripheral inflammation, fatigue and sleep, in allergy. We examined 18 patients with severe seasonal allergy, and 13 healthy subjects in and out-of pollen season using positron emission tomography (n = 15/13) and the TSPO radioligand [C-11]PBR28. In addition, TNF-alpha, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-gamma were measured in peripheral blood, and subjective ratings of fatigue and sleepiness as well as objective and subjective sleep were investigated. No difference in levels of TSPO was seen between patients and healthy subjects, nor in relation to pollen season. However, allergic subjects displayed both increased fatigue, sleepiness and increased percentage of deep sleep, as well as increased levels of IL-5 and TNF-alpha during pollen season, compared to healthy subjects. Allergic subjects also had shorter total sleep time, regardless of season. In conclusion, allergic subjects are indicated to respond to allergen exposure during pollen season with a clear pattern of behavioral disruption and peripheral inflammatory activation, but not with changes in brain TSPO levels. This underscores a need for development and use of more specific markers to understand brain consequences of peripheral inflammation that will be applicable in human subjects. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The results established that: (a) [(3)H]imipramine binds to a single site with relatively high affinity (K(d) = 0.41 +/- 0.04 mu M), (b) imipramine inhibits [(3)H]imipramine binding to the resting/kappa-bungarotoxin-bound AChR = (K(i) = 0.68 +/- 0.08 mu M) with practically the same affinity as to the desensitized/epibatidine-bound AChR (K(i) = 0.83 +/- 0.08 mu M), suggesting that TCAs do not discriminate between these conformational states, and (c) although TCAs (IC(50) similar to 1.8-2.7 mu M) and mecamylamine (IC(50) = 3.3 +/- 0.4 mu M) inhibit (+/-)-epibatidine-induced Ca(2+) influx with potencies in the same concentration range, TCAs (K(i) similar to 1-3.6 mu M), but not mecamylamine (apparent IC(50) similar to 0.2 mM), inhibit [(3)H]imipramine binding to h alpha 3 beta 4 AChRs in different conformational states. This is explained by our docking results where imipramine, in the neutral and protonated states, interacts with the leucine (position 9') and valine/phenylalanine (position 13') rings, whereas protonated mecamylamine (>99% at physiological pH) interacts with the outer ring (position 20'). Our data indicate that TCAs bind to overlapping sites located between the serine and valine/phenylalanine rings in the h alpha 3 beta 4 AChR ion channel, whereas protonated mecamylamine can be attracted to the channel mouth before blocking ion flux by interacting with a luminal site in its neutral state.

However, several studies indicate that the roles of insulin and IGF-I may not be that easy to separate. In this study, insulin and IGF-I specificity in terms of gene regulation was investigated in primary human skeletal muscle cells before and after differentiation. Cell cultures were treated with 100 nM insulin. IGF-I or nothing for 4 h, and gene expression was subsequently determined using the Affymetrix microarray platform. Insulin and IGF-I receptor levels were determined by qRT-PCR and by radioligand binding assays. In primary myoblasts, insulin did not have any significant effect on gene expression, whereas IGF-I regulated 229 genes. In primary myotubes, insulin regulated 105 genes, whereas IGF-I regulated 697 genes. Additionally, 99 genes were found to be differentially regulated by insulin and IGF-I in a dirrect comparion. The majority of these genes were specifically regulated by IGF-I 16 genes were regulated by both ligands, and no genes were regulated by only insulin. The microarray results correlated with low levels of insulin receptors compared to IGF-I receptors as determined by radioligand binding assays. In the myotubes, we did not identify any ligand specificity in terms of functional categories. The major difference between the two ligands was their respective potencies in gene regulation, which was higher for IGF-I than for insulin. This was true for genes involved in both mitrogenic and metabolic regulations. The data suggest that IGF-I is a more important metabolic regulator in skeletal muscle than previously estimated.

In order to understand the in vivo-specific site and subunit localization of this radioligand, we examined the effect of the endogenous glycine site agonists, glycine and D-serine, on in vivo [C-11]L-703,717 binding. An increase in extracellular glycine concentration by treatment with a glycine transporter I (GlyT1)-selective inhibitor, NFPS ethyl ester, significantly decreased the cerebellar localization of [C-11]L-703,717 in rats. D-serine is known to be concentrated in mammalian forebrain regions. The lack of D-serine detection in the cerebellum may be due to the fact that it has the highest enzymatic activity of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO). It was found that the cerebellar localization of [C-11]L-703,717 is greatly diminished in mutant mice lacking DAO, in which D-serine content in the cerebellum is drastically increased from a nondetectable level in normal mice. These studies indicate that [C-11]L-703,717 is susceptible to inhibition by glycine site agonists in its in vivo binding, and suggest that regional differences in inhibitions by endogenous agonists may be a crucial factor in the site- and subunit-specific binding of this glycine-site antagonist.

Toward the Optimization of Click-Mediated Pretargeted Radioimmunotherapy	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						radioimmunotherapy; click chemistry; pretargeting; pretargeted radioimmunotherapy; Lu-177; colorectal cancer; inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction; tetrazine; trans-cyclooctene; dendrimer; masking agent	IN-VIVO CHEMISTRY; BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY; TRANS-CYCLOOCTENE; STRATEGY; CANCER	Pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) based on the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction has shown promise in murine models of disease, yet the radiation dosimetry of this approach must be optimized to make it a viable clinical option. To this end, we have leveraged two recent developments in pretargeted imaging-dendritic scaffolds and masking agents-to improve the dosimetric profile of a proof-of-concept PRIT system that is based on the huA33 antibody, a Lu-177-labeled tetrazine radioligand ([Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-PEG(7)-Tz), and a mouse model of A33 antigen-expressing colorectal carcinoma. Pretargeting using an huA33 immunoconjugate bearing a trans-cyclooctene-decorated dendritic scaffold ((ss)huA33-DEN-TCO) produced significantly higher tumoral activity concentrations at 120 h post-injection (23.0 +/- 2.2 %ID/g) than those achieved with an analogous, dendrimer-lacking immunoconjugate (12.7 +/- 2.6 %ID/g). However, pretargeting using (ss)huA33-DEN-TCO also resulted in increased activity concentrations in the blood at the same time point (1.9 +/- 0.4 %ID/g) compared to the dendrimer-lacking construct (0.7 +/- 0.2 %ID/g), thereby curtailing improvements to the tumor-to-blood therapeutic ratio of the system. In order to circumvent this issue, a tetrazine-labeled, dextran-based masking agent (Tz-DP) was injected prior to the radioligand to prevent the ligation between [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-PEG(7)-Tz and circulating immunoconjugate. This approach dramatically decreased the absorbed dose to the blood but also attenuated the absorbed dose to the tumor and increased the absorbed dose to the lungs. Ultimately, these data suggest that dendritic scaffolds and masking agents could be used to improve the dosimetry of PRIT, but the combination of these technologies will require extensive optimization.

The induction of apoptosis by ErPC3 requires TSPO, a mitochondria] membrane protein highly expressed in malignant gliomas. In this preclinical study, we monitored the effect of ErPC3 treatment in vivo using F-18-DPA-714 PET. Methods: In vitro studies investigated the antitumor effect of ErPC3 in 9L rat gliosarcoma cells. In vivo, glioma-bearing rats were imaged with F-18-DPA-714 for the time of treatment. Results: A significant decrease in 9L cell proliferation and viability and a significant increase in apoptosis and caspase-3 activation were demonstrated on ErPC3 treatment in cell culture. In the rat model, ErPC3 administration resulted in significant changes in F-18-DPA-714 tumor uptake over the course of the treatment. Immunohistochemistry revealed reduced tumor volume and increased cell death in ErPC3-treated animals accompanied by infiltration of the tumor core by CD11b-positive microglia/macrophages and glial fibrillary acidic protein positive astrocytes. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a potent antitumor effect of ErPC3 in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. PET imaging of TSPO expression using F-18-DPA-714 allows effective monitoring and quantification of disease progression and response to ErPC3 therapy in intracranial 9L gliomas.

The purposes of this study were to: 1) evaluate the test/retest reproducibility of [I-123] 2 beta-Carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-((Z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane ([I-123]mZIENT); and 2) to assess displacement of [(123)]mZIENT following administration of SERT specific drugs. Methods: Six female baboons (Papio anubis) were scanned following iv. administration of [(123)]mZIENT. The regional binding potential (BP) was determined using a simplified reference tissue model, with the cerebellum used as a reference region. The test/retest reproducibility of BPnd was determined following repeated injection of [I-123]mZIENT on a different day. To assess the displacement of [I-123]mZIENT from SERT, citalopram (0.01-5 mg/kg) or sertraline (0.01-0.5 mg/kg) was given as iv bolus at similar to 4h following administration of [I-123]mZIENT. Results: The test/retest variability of BPnd was less than 10% for all SERT-rich brain regions. Estimates of ED50 for displacement of [I-123]mZIENT in SERT-rich regions were consistent with previous reports for the (C-11] analog of [I-123]mZIENT. Both citalopram and sertraline displaced [I-123]mZIENT from SERT in a dose-dependent manner, with maximal observed displacements of greater than 80% in the diencephalon and greater than 75% in brainstem for both citalopram and sertraline. Conclusions: [I-123]mZIENT demonstrates good test-retest reproducibility; and initial displacement studies suggest that this compound is highly selective for SERT. Overall, this radioligand has favorable characteristics for use in drug development studies and/or longitudinal studies interrogating SERT. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Novel Alexa Fluor-488 labeled antagonist of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor: Application to a fluorescence polarization-based receptor binding assay	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Purines; Fluorescence polarization; G protein-coupled receptor; High-throughput screening; A(2A) adenosine receptor	LIGANDS; PHARMACOLOGY; DERIVATIVES; SELECTIVITY; ANALOGS; RAT	Fluorescence polarization (FP) assay has many advantages over the traditional radioreceptor binding studies. We developed an A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR) FP assay using a newly synthesized fluorescent antagonist of the A(2A)AR (MRS5346), a pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5-amine derivative conjugated to the fluorescent dye Alexa Fluor-488. MRS5346 displayed a K-i; value of 111 +/- 16 nM in radioligand binding using ([H-3]CGS21680 and membranes prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the human A(2A)AR. In a cyclic AMP functional assay, MRS5346 was shown to be an A(2A)AR antagonist. MRS5346 did not show any effect on A(1) and A(3) ARs in binding or the A(2B)AR in a cyclic AMP assay at 10 mu M. Its suitability as a fluorescent tracer was indicated in an initial observation of an FP signal following A(2A)AR binding. The FP signal was optimal with 20 nM MRS5346 and 150 mu g protein/mL HEK293 membranes. The association and dissociation kinetic parameters were readily determined using this FP assay. The K-d value of MRS5346 calculated from kinetic parameters was 16.5 +/- 4.7 nM. In FP competition binding experiments using MRS5346 as a tracer, K-i values of known AR agonists and antagonists consistently agreed with K-i values from radioligand binding. Thus, this FP assay, which eliminates using radioisotopes, appears to be appropriate for both routine receptor binding and high-throughput screening with respect to speed of analysis, displaceable signal and precision. The approach used in the present study could be generally applicable to other GPCRs. Published by Elsevier Inc.	[Kecskes, Miklos; Kumar, T.

Brain imaging of serotonin 4 receptors in humans with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]SB207145-PET	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Test-retest; Citalopram; SSRI	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; POSTMORTEM HUMAN BRAIN; 5-HT4 RECEPTORS; NORMATIVE DATA; BINDING; PET; ACTIVATION; AGONIST; LIGAND	Pharmacological stimulation of the serotonin 4 (5-HT4) receptor has shown promise for treatment of Alzheimer's disease and major depression. A new selective radioligand, [C-11]SB207145, for positron emission tomography (PET) Was used to quantify brain 5-HT4 receptors in sixteen healthy Subjects (20-45 years 8, males) using the simplified reference tissue model. We tested within our Population the effect of age and other demographic factors on the endpoint. In seven subjects, we tested the vulnerability of radioligand binding to a pharmacolological challenge with citalopram, which is expected to increase competition from endogenous serotonin. Given radiotracer administration at a range of specific activities, we were able to use the individual BPND measurements for population-based estimation of the saturation binding parameters: B-max ranged from 0.3 to 1.6 nM. B-max was in accordance with post-mortem brain studies (Spearman's r = 0.83, p = 0.04), and the regional binding potentials, BPND, were on average 2.6 in striatum, 0.42 in prefrontal cortex, and 0.91 in hippocampus. We found no effect of sex but a decreased binding with age (p = 0.046). A power analysis showed that. given the low inter-and intrasubject variation, use of the present method will enable detection of a 15% difference in striatum with only 7-13 subjects in a 2-sample test and with only 4-5 subjects in a paired test. The citalopram challenge did not discernibly alter [C-11]SB207145 binding. In conclusion, the 5-HT4 receptor binding in human brain can be reliably assessed with [C-11]SB207145, which is encouraging for future PET studies of drug occupancy OF patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Quantitative assessment of antibodies to ribonucleoproteins in primary Sjogren syndrome: correlation with B-cell biomarkers and disease activity	ANNALS OF THE RHEUMATIC DISEASES			English	Article							SYSTEMIC-LUPUS-ERYTHEMATOSUS; CONNECTIVE-TISSUE DISEASES; NECROSIS-FACTOR FAMILY; LYMPHOCYTE STIMULATOR; AUTOIMMUNE-DISEASES; SALIVARY-GLANDS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; RADIOLIGAND ASSAY; CLINICAL ACTIVITY; BAFF	Objectives: To assess the added value of using a radioligand assay (RLA) compared with ELISA to detect antibodies to SSA, SSB and RNP, and to analyse the correlation between autoantibody levels, B-cell biomarkers and disease activity. Patients and methods: Antibodies to SSA, SSB and RNP were assessed in 127 patients with primary Sjogren syndrome (pSS) using an RLA and ELISA. In parallel, measures of B-cell activation were determined including serum levels of B-cell-activating factor of the tumour necrosis factor family or BLyS (BAFF). Results: RLA was more sensitive than ELISA for the detection of antibodies to SSB (54% of positive samples versus 37%, respectively) and antibodies to RNP (9% vs 3%). No difference was seen for the sensitivity of detection of antibodies to SSA. Anti-SSA and anti-SSB levels were correlated with both techniques. Mean levels of antibodies to SSA were significantly higher in patients presenting antibodies to both SSA and SSB than in those exhibiting antibodies to SSA only (RLA: mean (SEM) anti-SSA levels 2343 (158) cpm vs 1348 (286) cpm, respectively, p = 0.02; ELISA: 6.8 (0.8) vs 3.8 (0.4), respectively, p = 0.003). Levels of antibodies to SSA and SSB significantly correlated with those of circulating BAFF (r = 0.4, p = 0.004 and r = 0.6, p < 0.001, respectively) and with B-cell biomarkers, including levels of gamma-globulins, beta(2) microglobulin and rheumatoid factor. Conclusion: RLA allowed a quantitative and more sensitive detection of antibodies to SSB and RNP in pSS. Quantitative assessment of autoantibodies might disclose a biomarker of disease activity and enable further insight into the pathogenesis of the spreading of the autoantibody response.

Quantitative imaging of estrogen receptor expression in breast cancer with PET and <SUP>18</SUP>F-fluoroestradiol	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						estrogen receptor; breast cancer; F-18-FES PET; IHC; tracer uptake	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ENZYME-IMMUNOASSAY; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL ANALYSIS; BIOCHEMICAL ASSAY; THERAPY; PERFORMANCE; CARCINOMAS; TISSUES; FES	The PET compound F-18-fluoroestradiol (F-18-FES) has been developed and tested as an agent for the imaging of estrogen receptor (ER) expression in vivo. F-18-FES uptake has been shown to correlate with ER expression assayed in vitro by radioligand binding; however, immunohistochemistry (IHC) rather than radioligand binding is used most often to measure ER expression in clinical practice. We therefore compared F-18-FES uptake with ER expression assayed in vitro by IHC with both qualitative and semiquantitative measures. Methods: Seventeen patients with primary or metastatic breast cancer were studied with dynamic F-18-FES PET; cancer tissue samples, collected close to the time of imaging, were assayed for ER expression by IHC. For each tumor, partial-volume-corrected measures of F-18-FES uptake were compared with ER expression measured by 3 different ER scoring methods: qualitative scoring (0-3+), the Allred score (0-10), and a computerized IHC index. Results: There was excellent agreement (r = 0.99) between observers using IHC as well as the different methods of measuring ER content (P < 0.001). ER-negative tumors had F-18-FES partial-volume-corrected standardized uptake values of less than 1.0, whereas ER-positive tumors had values above 1.1. Correlation coefficients for the different measures of ER content and the different measures of F-18-FES uptake ranged from 0.57 to 0.73, with the best correlation being between the computerized IHC index and F-18-FES partial-volume-corrected standardized uptake values. Conclusion: Our results showed good agreement between F-18-FES PET and ER expression measured by IHC. F-18-FES imaging may be a useful tool for aiding in the assessment of ER status, especially in patients with multiple tumors or for tumors that are difficult to biopsy.

Irreversible binding of a novel phenylisothiocyanate tropane analog to monoamine transporters in rat brain	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cocaine; dopamine transporter; serotonin transporter; norepinephrine transporter; tropane; phenylisothiocyanate	2-SUBSTITUTED COCAINE ANALOGS; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; LIGAND-BINDING; HIGH-AFFINITY; PHOTOAFFINITY LIGANDS; I-125 RTI-55; SITES; SEROTONIN; RECEPTORS; MUTANTS	Irreversible tropane analogs have been useful in identifying binding sites of cocaine on biogenic amine transporters, including transporters for dopamine (DAT), serotonin (SERT) and norepinephrine (NET). The present study characterizes the properties of the novel phenylisothiocyanate tropane HD-205, synthesized from the highly potent 2-napthyl tropane analog WF-23. In radioligand binding studies in brain membranes, direct IC50 values of HD-205 were 4.1,14 and 280 nM at DAT, SERT and NET, respectively. Wash-resistant binding was characterized by preincubation of HD-205 with brain membranes, followed by extensive washing before performing transporter radioligand binding. Results for HD-205 showed wash-resistant IC50 values of 191, 230 and 840 nM at DAT, SERT and NET, respectively. Saturation binding studies with [I-125]RTI-55 in membranes pretreated with 100 nM HD-205 showed that HD-205 significantly decreased the B a but not KD of DAT and SERT binding. To further characterize its irreversible binding, an iodinated analog of HD-205, HD-244, was prepared from a trimethylsilyl precursor. The direct IC50 of HD-244 at DAT was 20 nM. [125I]HD-244 was synthesized with chloramine-T, purified on HPLC, reacted with rat striatal membranes, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Results showed several nonspecific labeled bands, but only a single specific band of radioactivity co-migrating with an immunoreactive DAT band at approx. 80 kilodaltons was detected, suggesting that [I-125]HD-244 covalently labeled DAT protein in striatal membranes. These results demonstrate that phenylisothiocyanate analogs of WF-23 can be used as potential ligands to map distinct binding sites of cocaine analogs at DAT. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we describe the radioligand binding properties and pharmacological effects of a newly synthesized, high-affinity, selective, and noncompetitive mGluR1 antagonist, 6-amino-N-cyclohexyl-N, 3-dimethylthiazolo[3,2-a] benzimidazole-2-carboxamide (YM-298198). YM-298198 inhibited glutamate-induced inositol phosphate production in mGluR1-NIH3T3 cells with an IC50 of 16 +/- 5.8 nM in a noncompetitive manner. Its radiolabeled form, [H-3] YM298198, bound to mGluR1-NIH3T3 cell membranes with a K D of 32 +/- 8.5 nM and a B-max of 2297 +/- 291 fmol/mg protein. In ligand displacement experiments using rat cerebellum membrane, an existing noncompetitive mGluR1 antagonist 7-( hydroxyimino) cyclo-propa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt) competitively displaced [H-3]YM-298198 binding, although glutamate and other mGluR1 ligands acting on a glutamate site failed to inhibit [H-3]YM-298198 binding, suggesting that YM-298198 binds to CPCCOEt ( allosteric) binding sites but not to glutamate ( agonist) binding sites. Specificity was demonstrated for mGluR1 over mGluR subtypes 2 to 7, ionotropic glutamate receptors, and other receptor, transporter, and ion channel targets. In in vivo experiments, orally administered YM-298198 showed a significant analgesic effect in streptozotocin- induced hyperalgesic mice at doses (30 mg/kg) that did not cause Rotarod performance impairment, indicating that it is also useful even for in vivo experiments. In conclusion, YM-298198 is a newly synthesized, high-affinity, selective, and noncompetitive antagonist of mGluR1 that will be a useful pharmacological tool due to its highly active properties in vitro and in vivo. Its radiolabeled form [H-3]YM-298198 will also be a valuable tool for future investigation of the mGluR1.

Biochemically, MDMA can increase synaptic levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine that, conceivably, might interact with multiple populations or subpopulations of neurotransmitter receptors. The present study attempted to antagonize the DS effects of MDMA using the nonselective agents clozapine, cyproheptadine, and pizotyline. An extensive and comparative radioligand binding profile was also obtained for the latter two agents. The purported antagonists were administered in combination with the training dose of MDMA to groups of Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA from saline vehicle in a standard two-lever operant paradigm using a VI-15s schedule of reinforcement. Clozapine was without effect at the doses evaluated, and cyproheptadine only partially attenuated MDMA-appropriate responding. In contrast, pizotyline (AD(50)=2.5 mg/kg), in combination with the MDMA training dose, resulted in a dose related decrease in percent drug-appropriate responding to saline levels. In a separate group of animals trained to discriminate the structurally-related agent N-methyl-l-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-aminopropane (PMMA) from vehicle, pretreatment with pizotyline also resulted in a substantial decrease in drug-appropriate responding. The results with cyproheptadine and pizotyline in the binding assays confirmed that these agents display high affinity for multiple subpopulations of serotonergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, and cholinergic receptors. The overall results of the present investigation indicate that pizotyline, which is clinically available in some countries, might be of clinical utility in the treatment of MDMA overdose.

They potentiate GABA-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)-triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS) binding to membranes from a GABA(B(1b/2))-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cell line at low micromolar concentrations, but do not stimulate [S-35]GTPgammaS binding by themselves. Similar effects of GS39783 are seen on native GABA(B) receptors in rat brain membranes. Concentration-response curves with GABA in the presence of different fixed concentrations of GS39783 reveal an increase of both the potency and maximal efficacy of GABA at the GABA(B(1b/2)) heterodimer. In radioligand binding experiments, GS39783 reduces the kinetic rate constants of the association and dissociation of [H-3]3-aminopropylphosphinic acid, resulting in a net increase in affinity for the agonist radioligand. In equilibrium binding experiments (displacement of the antagonist ligand [H-3]CGP62349), GS39783 increases agonist affinities. Agonist displacement curves are bi-phasic, probably reflecting the G protein-coupled and uncoupled states of the receptor. The proportion of the high-affinity component is increased by GS39783, suggesting that the G protein coupling of the receptor is also promoted by the positive modulator. We also show that GS39783 has modulatory effects in cellular assays such as GABA(B) receptor-mediated activation of inwardly rectifying potassium channels in Xenopus oocytes and Ca2+ signaling in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In a more physiological context, GS39783 is shown to suppress paired pulse inhibition in rat hippocampal slices. This effect is reversed by the competitive GABA(B) receptor antagonist CGP55845A and is produced most likely by enhancing the effect of synaptically released GABA at presynaptic GABA(B) receptors.

Sample Population-Brain tissue specimens obtained during necropsy from 5 adult male research horses. Procedure-Membrane-enriched homogenates from cerebral cortex and striatum were evaluated by radioligand binding assays with the A(1)-selective ligand [H-3]DPCPX and the A(2a)-selective ligand [H-3]ZM241385. Functional responses to adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists were determined by a nucleotide exchange assay using [S-35]-guanosine 5(1)-(gamma-thio) triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS). Results-Saturable high affinity [H-3]DPCPX binding (A(1)) sites were detected in cerebral cortex and striatum, whereas high-affinity [H-3]ZM241385 binding (A(2a)) sites were detected only in striatum. Caffeine and related methylxanthines had similar binding affinities at A(1) and A(2a) sites with rank orders of drug binding affinities (theophylline > paraxanthine greater than or equal to caffeine much greater than theobromine) similar to other species. [S-35]GTP-gammaS exchange revealed that caffeine and its metabolites act as pure adenosine receptor antagonists at concentrations that correspond to A(1) and A(2a) receptor binding affinities. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Results of our study affirm the presence of guanine nucleotide binding protein linked adenosine receptors (ie, high-affinity A(1) and A(2a) adenosine receptors) in equine forebrain tissues and reveal the antagonistic actions by caffeine and several biologically active caffeine metabolites.

These insecticides also have the ability to potently displace the binding of [H-3]batrachotoxinin A 20-alpha -benzoate ([H-3]BTX-B) to neuronal sodium channels in a concentration-dependent manner. The study compounds can be classified as competitive inhibitors of radioligand binding, since they decrease the affinity of [H-3]BTX-B for site 2 without affecting the concentration of sites labelled by this radioligand. Our kinetic analyses revealed that at its IC50 the 4-carbomethoxyaminobenzylpiperidine analogue reduces the rate of association of [H-3]BTX-B with site 2, whereas higher concentrations were required to accelerate dissociation of the [H-3]BTX-B:sodium channel complex. These results indicate an ability to interact with both non-activated and persistently activated states of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel, but higher affinity for the former. Such a profile also implies that inhibition of [3H]BTX-B binding to site 2 occurs via an allosteric mechanism. In addition, arylalkylbenzhydrolpiperidines interact with presynaptic voltage-sensitive calcium channels, since we demonstrate that they inhibit increases in [free Ca++] and Ca-45(++) uptake when evoked by high KCl concentration in mouse brain synaptosomal preparations. Such effects generally occur at concentrations that are higher than those required to inhibit sodium channels. Blockade of sodium and calcium channels may therefore contribute to the in vivo neurological effects observed in rodents exposed to these insecticides. (C) 2001 Society of Chemical Industry.

Crystal Structure and Subsequent Ligand Design of a Nonriboside Partial Agonist Bound to the Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> Receptor	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article								In this study, we determined the crystal structure of an engineered human adenosine A(2A) receptor bound to a partial agonist and compared it to structures cocrystallized with either a full agonist or an antagonist/inverse agonist. The interaction between the partial agonist, belonging to a class of dicyanopyridines, and amino acids in the ligand binding pocket inspired us to develop a small library of derivatives and assess their affinity in radioligand binding studies and potency and intrinsic activity in a functional, label-free, intact cell assay. It appeared that some of the derivatives retained the partial agonist profile, whereas other ligands turned into inverse agonists. We rationalized this remarkable behavior with additional computational docking studies.	[Amelia, Tasia; van Veldhoven, Jacobus P.

Here we report on our experience with a series of 73 castration-resistant prostate carcinoma patients treated with Ac-225-PSMA-617, identifying variables predictive for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) after Ac-225-PSMA-617 treatment. Methods: Ac-225-PSMA-617 was administered to patients who had metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma and who had exhausted available therapy options for their disease. Full blood count, glomerular filtration rate, and liver function test were obtained at baseline and on follow-up for evaluation of toxicity. Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT was obtained at baseline, before every treatment cycle, and on follow-up for selection of patients for treatment, to determine the activity of the treatment agent to be administered, and for response assessment. Serial prostatespecific antigen (PSA) was obtained for PSA response assessment. Results: Seventy-three men (mean age, 69 y; range, 45-85 y) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate carcinoma were treated with 210 cycles of Ac-225-PSMA-617. In 70% of patients, a PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50% was obtained; 82% of patients had any PSA decline. In 29% of patients, all lesions on Ga-68-PSMA PET resolved in response to treatment. During follow-up, 23 patients experienced disease progression, whereas 13 patients died from their disease. The estimated median PFS and OS were 15.2 mo (95% CI, 13.1-17.4) and 18 mo (95% CI, 16.2-19.9), respectively. In univariate analyses, factors such as baseline PSA, any PSA decline, PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50%, prior chemotherapy, prior radiation therapy, and baseline hemoglobin level were associated with longer PFS and OS (all Ps < 0.05). In multivariate analyses, there was a negative association between prior Lu-177-PSMA therapy and PFS, and a positive association between PSA decline of greater or equal to 50% and PFS. Only a PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50% remained significantly associated with OS on multivariate analyses. Xerostomia was seen in 85% of patients but was not severe enough to warrant discontinuing treatment. Anemia was seen in 27 patients; no patients had grade IV bone marrow toxicity. Renal failure of grade III or IV was seen in 5 patients with baseline renal impairment. Conclusion: In this study, a PSA decline of greater than or equal to 50% after treatment with Ac-225-PSMA-617 was proven by multivariate analyses to be significantly associated with OS and PFS. Furthermore, previous Lu-177-PSMA treatment was negatively associated with PFS in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

The present study utilized both radioligand kinetic and functional experiments to further probe the nature of the muscarinic receptors in gallbladder smooth muscle and their mode of coupling to intra- and extra-cellular Ca2+ sources. Dissociation kinetic studies using [H-3] N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) indicated that the binding profile in guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle could not be reconciled with that expected for a single muscarinic receptor subtype, the latter determined in parallel experiments conducted on the cloned muscarinic M-1-M-5 subtypes in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Furthermore, comparison of the gallbladder data with the dissociation characteristics of [H-3]NMS in guinea pig urinary bladder revealed a significantly different kinetic profile, with the urinary bladder, but not the gallbladder, demonstrating biphasic radioligand dissociation kinetics. In functional experiments, carbachol caused a concentration-dependent contraction of guinea pig gallbladder smooth muscle strips in Ca2+-free or 5 mM Sr2+-substituted physiological salt solutions (PSS) with amplitudes of the maximal contractions corresponding to 45.8 +/- 8.0% and 33.2 +/- 6.6% of control responses in normal PSS, respectively. Furthermore, the stimulus-response characteristics of carbachol-mediated contraction appeared significantly altered in Ca2+-free PSS relative to normal or Sr2+-substituted PSS. The antagonist, methoctramine (1 x 10(-7)-3 x 10(-5) M), exerted only a slight inhibition of carbachol (10(-5) M)-induced contractions in 5 mM Sr2+-substituted medium, whereas it was significantly more potent in antagonizing gallbladder contractions in response to 10(-5) M carbachol in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Both atropine and tripitramine were equipotent in antagonizing carbachol-induced contractions in Ca2+-free (pIC(50): 6.85 +/- 0.11 for atropine and 5.75 +/- 0.32 for tripitramine) and Sr2+-substituted media (pIC(50): 6.88 +/- 0.25 for atropine and 5.70 +/- 0.16 for tripitramine), and pirenzepine was only slightly more potent in Ca2+-free PSS (pIC(50): 5.66 +/- 0.23) than in Sr2+-substituted PSS (pIC(50): 5.33 +/- 0.21). Taken together, our data indicate that carbachol contracts guinea pig gallbladder by stimulating two distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes linked to extracellular Ca2+ influx and intracellular Ca2+ release. These two subtypes may represent the muscarinic M-3 and M-4 receptors, although the presence of the muscarinic M-2 receptor subtype is also suggested from the binding data.

Effect of the rigidification of propranolol, a mixed β-adrenoceptor and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R antagonist	PHARMAZIE			English	Article							1,3-DIOXOLANE-BASED LIGANDS; RECEPTOR; CONTRACTION; RESPONSES; ANALOGS; DESIGN; AGENTS	Propranolol is a popular beta adrenergic antagonists that, together with pindolol, binds also to serotoninergic receptors, namely 5-HT1A/B. In this work the rigidification of the propranolol structure by locking its hydroxyl group within a 1,3-dioxolane ring was investigated. Constrained derivatives of propranolol were synthesized, fully characterized and tested for their affinity at beta-adrenoreceptors and 5-HT1A/B/C receptors using radioligand binding assay. The constrained derivatives were inactive, as expected, at beta(1/2/3) adrenergic receptors. Although less expected, these derivatives failed to bind also to 5-HT1A/B/C receptors. The rigidification of propranolol is detrimental for 5-HT1AR activity.

Binding densities were not significantly different between heavy and moderate drinkers, neither between alcohol consumers that were abstinent or non-abstinent before death, nor between ethanol drinkers and controls.

J	Fabiani, ME; Dinh, DT; Nassis, L; Casley, DJ; Johnston, CI				Fabiani, ME; Dinh, DT; Nassis, L; Casley, DJ; Johnston, CI			Comparative <i>in vivo</i> effects of irbesartan and losartan on angiotensin II receptor binding in the rat kidney following oral administration	CLINICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						angiotensin; angiotensin II antagonists; angiotensin receptors; AT(1) receptors; AT(1) receptor antagonists; irbesartan; losartan	ACTIVE ANTIHYPERTENSIVE AGENT; CONVERTING ENZYME-INHIBITORS; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONIST; SYSTEM; THERAPY; AUTORADIOGRAPHY; HYPERTENSION; BIOCHEMISTRY; PHARMACOLOGY	We examined the ability of the new non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist irbesartan to inhibit AT(I) receptors in vivo in the rat kidney following oral administration, compared with the prototype drug losartan. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300 g) were gavaged with either irbesartan or losartan at doses of 1, 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg, or with corresponding vehicle. Rats were killed at 0, 1,2, 8, or 24 h after drug administration, trunk blood was collected and the kidneys were removed. The effects of irbesartan and losartan on angiotensin II receptor binding were determined by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the specific radioligand I-125-[Sar(1),Ile(8)]angiotensin II. High levels of angiotensin II receptor binding in the rat kidney were demonstrated in the glomeruli and inner stripe of the outer medulla, which was attributed to AT(I) receptors. At 1 h after dosing, irbesartan (1-100 mg/kg) and losartan (1-30 mg/kg) significantly inhibited AT(I) receptor binding in all anatomical areas of the kidney, in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal effect at 100 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg respectively. For a 10 mg/kg dose, inhibition of AT(I) receptor binding was maximal around 1-2 h after oral administration of losartan, whereas maximal binding occurred between 2 and 8 h for irbesartan; both drugs produced persistent tissue blockade at 24h. In radioligand binding studies, irbesartan, losartan and EXP3174 (1 x 10 (10) to 1 x 10(-5) M) displaced I-125-[Sar(1),Il(8)]angiotensin II binding from renal AT(I) receptors in a concentration-dependent manner, with a rank order of potency of irbesartan > EXP3174 > losartan. The concentration required to displace 50% of radioligand binding (IC50) by irbesartan, EXP3174 and losartan was 1.00+/-0.2 nM. 3.5+/-0.4 nM and 8.9+/-1.1 nM respectively. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that irbesartan and losartan produce effective and sustained inhibition of AT(I) receptors in vivo in the kidney following oral administration. However, irbesartan appears less potent, with respect to dosage, than losartan in vivo, despite having a higher affinity for AT(I) receptors in vitro. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is unclear, but it may reflect the slower onset of action of irbesartan and its rate of tissue accessibility. Inhibition of angiotensin II receptors in target tissues such as the kidney may represent an important action of AT(I) receptor antagonists, which may contribute to the beneficial effects of these agents in the clinical setting.

We hypothesized that using the salivary glands as a reference organ can enable selective patient stratification. We aimed to establish a PSMA PET tumor-to-salivary gland ratio (PSG score) to predict outcomes after [177Lu]PSMA. Methods: In total, 237 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer treated with [177Lu]PSMA were included. A quantitative PSG (qPSG) score (SUVmean ratio of whole-body tumor to parotid glands) was semiautomatically calculated on baseline [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET images. Patients were divided into 3 groups: high (qPSG > 1.5), intermediate (qPSG = 0.5-1.5), and low (qPSG < 0.5) scores. Ten readers interpreted the 3-dimensional maximum-intensity-projection baseline [68Ga]PSMA-11 PET images and classified patients into 3 groups based on visual PSG (vPSG) score: high (most of the lesions showed higher uptake than the parotid glands) intermediate (neither low nor high), and low (most of the lesions showed lower uptake than the parotid glands). Outcome data included a more than 50% prostate-specific antigen decline, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Results: Of the 237 patients, the numbers in the high, intermediate, and low groups were 56 (23.6%), 163 (68.8%), and 18 (7.6%), respectively, for qPSG score and 106 (44.7%), 96 (40.5%), and 35 (14.8%), respectively, for vPSG score. The interreader reproducibility of the vPSG score was substantial (Fleiss weighted K, 0.68). The more than 50% prostate-specific antigen decline was better in patients with a higher PSG score (high vs. intermediate vs. low, 69.6% vs. 38.7% vs. 16.7%, respectively, for qPSG [P < 0.001] and 63.2% vs 33.3% vs 16.1%, respectively, for vPSG [P < 0.001]). The median PSA progression-free survival of the high, intermediate, and low groups by qPSG score was 7.2, 4.0, and 1.9 mo (P < 0.001), respectively, by qPSG score and 6.7, 3.8, and 1.9 mo (P < 0.001), respectively, by vPSG score. The median OS of the high, intermediate, and low groups was 15.0, 11.2, and 13.9 mo (P = 0.017), respectively, by qPSG score and 14.3, 9.6, and 12.9 mo (P = 0.018), respectively, by vPSG score. Conclusion: The PSG score was prognostic for PSA response and OS after [Lu-177]PSMA. The visual PSG score assessed on 3-dimensional maximum-intensity-projection PET images yielded substantial reproducibility and comparable prognostic value to the quantitative score.

The effect on adenosine A, receptor (A,R) and A(2A) receptor (A R) in brains from both mothers and 15-day-old neonates was assayed using radioligand binding and real time PCR assays. Mothers receiving L-glutamate during gestation, lactation, and throughout gestation and lactation showed a significant decrease in total A(1)R number (water+water, 302+/-49 fmol/mg; L-glutamate+water, 109+/-11 fmol/mg, P<0.01; water+L-glutamate, 52 13 fmol/mg, P<0.01; L-glutamate+L-glutamate, 128+/-33 fmol/mg, P<0.05). No variations were detected in the Kd parameter. Concerning adenosine A R, radioligand binding assays revealed that Bmax parameter remains unaltered in maternal brain in response to glutamate exposure. However, Kd parameter was significantly decreased in all L-glutamate-treated groups (water+water, 5.3+/-1.3 nM; L-glutamate water, 0.5+/-0.1 nM; water+L-glutamate, 0.9+/-0.1 nM; L-glutamate L-glutamate, 0.7+/-0.1 nM, P<0.01 in all cases). In both male and female neonates, A(1)R was also decreased after long-term glutamate exposure during gestation, lactation, and gestation plus lactation (male neonates: water+water, 564 68 fmol/mg; L-glutamate+ water, 61+/-8 fmol/mg; water+L-glutamate, 95 20 fmol/mg; L-glutamate+L-glutamate, 111+/-15 fmol/mg; P<0.01 in all cases; female neonates: water+water, 216+/-35 fmol/mg; L-glutamate+ water, 59+/-9 fmol/mg; water+L-glutamate, 139+/-16 fmol/mg; L-glutamate+L-glutamate, 97+/-14 fmol/mg; P<0.01 in all cases). No variations were found in mRNA level coding adenosine A(1)R in maternal or neonatal brain. Concerning adenosine A(2A)R, radioligand binding assays revealed that Bmax parameter was significantly increased in male and female neonates exposed to L-glutamate during lactation (male neonates: water+water, 214+/-23 fmol/mg; water+L-glutamate, 581+/-49 fmol/mg; P<0.01; female neonates: water+water, 51+/-10 fmol/mg; water+L-glutamate, 282+/-52 fmol/mg; P<0.05). No variations were found in mRNA level coding adenosine A(2A)R in maternal or neonatal brain. In summary, long-term L-glutamate treatment during gestation and lactation promotes a significant down-regulation of A(1)R in whole brain from both mother and neonates and a significant up-regulation of A(2A)R in neonates exposed to L-glutamate during lactation.

Techniques Used to Characterize the Binding of Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors to the Cyclooxygenase Active Site	CYCLOOXYGENASES: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS	Methods in Molecular Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Cyclooxygenase; Binding; Kinetics; Radiolabeled; Inhibitor	NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; DIFFERENTIAL INHIBITION; SELECTIVE-INHIBITION; H SYNTHASES; MECHANISMS	Inhibitors of enzyme-catalyzed reactions are typically characterized by their ability to diminish product formation while altering the Michaelis Menten constants V-max and K-m. Determination of an apparent inhibitor affinity (K-i) for the enzyme is also possible using this approach. Unfortunately, analysis of product formation does not easily provide information regarding the kinetics of inhibitor binding and may not be possible depending upon the mechanism of action. Radiolabeling of the inhibitor allows one to do a direct binding assay and thereby more directly determine the kinetics of inhibitor binding. With this in mind, we developed a radioligand-based binding assay for inhibitors of cyclooxygenase.

Sequential modification of the basic N-terminus of 1 led to the identification of the 5,6,7,8-tetrahydro[1,8]naphthyridine moiety (THN) as a lipophilic, moderately basic N-terminus that provides molecules with excellent potency and selectivity for the integrin receptor alpha(v)beta(3). The THN-containing analogue 5 is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the identification of a novel, nonpeptide radioligand with high affinity to alpha(v)beta(3) is also reported.

The maximum binding capacity (B-max) per milligram of protein was 33.1 to 107.5 femtomoles in laying birds and 101.4 to 114.9 femtomoles in nonlaying birds. Both K-d and B-max values changed during eggshell formation in laying birds. The results suggest that calcitonin receptor binding may be related to eggshell formation in guineafowl.

Comparison of the molecular interactions of two antagonists, MEN16132 or icatibant, at the human kinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						antagonist interaction; binding; bradykinin; G protein-coupled receptors; icatibant; kinin B-2 receptor; MEN16132; mutagenesis; reversibility	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; ACTING BRADYKININ-ANTAGONIST; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; NONPEPTIDE ANTAGONIST; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; POTENT; SULFONAMIDES	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Icatibant is a well-known kinin B-2 receptor antagonist currently used for angiooedema attacks. MEN16132 is a non-peptide B-2 receptor antagonist, more potent and long lasting than icatibant in different models. Here we studied the reasons for these differences between the two antagonists. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Rate of reversibility (over about 3 h) of the functional receptor blockade exerted by the antagonists was compared (inositol phosphates accumulation assay) in CHO cells expressing the human B-2 receptor and in human synovial cells. Antagonist pretreated cells were washed with medium and the time taken to restore bradykinin (BK) response measured. Antagonist affinity was measured by radioligand binding to wild type and mutated B-2 receptors. KEY RESULTS Recovery of BK-induced responses was slower in cells pretreated with MEN16132 than in those treated with icatibant. The affinity of icatibant (for the [3H]-BK or the B-2 receptor antagonist [3H]-MEN11270 binding site) was compared to that of MEN16132 using a panel of point-mutated receptors with mutations located at the transmembrane regions of the B-2 receptor, previously shown to decrease MEN16132 high affinity interaction. No consistent decrease of icatibant affinity was observed. From the different affinity of MEN16132 derivatives at wild type and W86A (transmembrane 2 region) receptors, and by evaluating its antagonist profile at the D266A/D284A double mutant receptor, a model of the MEN16132-B-2 receptor complex is proposed. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS MEN16132 dissociated from the B-2 receptor compartment more slowly than icatibant and interacted at a deeper level in transmembrane regions of the receptor.

Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabivarin suppresses in vitro epileptiform and in vivo seizure activity in adult rats	EPILEPSIA			English	Article						Epilepsy; Anticonvulsant; Cannabinoid; Pentylenetetrazole; Piriform cortex	PENTYLENETETRAZOLE-INDUCED SEIZURE; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; PIRIFORM CORTEX; ANTICONVULSANT PROPERTIES; CB1; CANNABIDIOL; EPILEPSY; AGONIST; MODEL	P>Purpose: We assessed the anticonvulsant potential of the phytocannabinoid Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabivarin (Delta 9-THCV) by investigating its effects in an in vitro piriform cortex (PC) brain slice model of epileptiform activity, on cannabinoid CB1 receptor radioligand-binding assays and in a generalized seizure model in rats. Methods: Delta 9-THCV was applied before (10 mu m Delta 9-THCV) or during (10-50 mu m Delta 9-THCV) epileptiform activity induced by Mg2+-free extracellular media in adult rat PC slices and measured using multielectrode array (MEA) extracellular electrophysiologic techniques. The actions of Delta 9-THCV on CB1 receptors were examined using [3H]SR141716A competition binding and [35S]GTP gamma S assays in rat cortical membranes. Effects of Delta 9-THCV (0.025-2.5 mg/kg) on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in adult rats were also assessed. Results: After induction of stable spontaneous epileptiform activity, acute Delta 9-THCV application (>= 20 mu m) significantly reduced burst complex incidence and the amplitude and frequency of paroxysmal depolarizing shifts (PDSs). Furthermore, slices pretreated with 10 mu m Delta 9-THCV prior to induction of epileptiform activity exhibited significantly reduced burst complex incidence and PDS peak amplitude. In radioligand-binding experiments, Delta 9-THCV acted as a CB1 receptor ligand, displacing 0.5 nm [3H]SR141716A with a Ki similar to 290 nm, but exerted no agonist stimulation of [35S]GTP gamma S binding. In PTZ-induced seizures in vivo, 0.25 mg/kg Delta 9-THCV significantly reduced seizure incidence. Discussion: These data demonstrate that Delta 9-THCV exerts antiepileptiform and anticonvulsant properties, actions that are consistent with a CB1 receptor-mediated mechanism and suggest possible therapeutic application in the treatment of pathophysiologic hyperexcitability states.

In animal models of diabetes, it contributes to pain polyneuropathy. This study aims at defining the cellular localization of B1R in thoracic spinal cord of type 1 diabetic rats by confocal microscopy with the use of a fluorescent agonist, [N alpha-Bodipy]-des-Arg(9)-BK (BdABK) and selective antibodies. Methods: Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (STZ; 65 mg/kg, i.p.). Four days post-STZ treatment, B1R expression was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR and autoradiography. The B1R selectivity of BdABK was determined by assessing its ability to displace B1R [I-125]-HPP-desArg(10)-Hoe 140 and B2R [I-125]-HPP-Hoe 140 radioligands. The in vivo activity of BdABK was also evaluated on thermal hyperalgesia. Results: R was increased by 18-fold (mRNA) and 2.7-fold (binding sites) in the thoracic spinal cord of STZ-treated rats when compared to control. BdABK failed to displace the B2R radioligand but displaced the B1R radioligand (IC50 = 5.3 nM). In comparison, IC50 values of B1R selective antagonist R-715 and B1R agonist des-Arg(9)-BK were 4.3 nM and 19 nM, respectively. Intraperitoneal BdABK and des-Arg(9)-BK elicited dose-dependent thermal hyperalgesia in STZ-treated rats but not in control rats. The B1R fluorescent agonist was co-localized with immunomarkers of microglia, astrocytes and sensory C fibers in the spinal cord of STZ-treated rats. Conclusion: The induction and up-regulation of B1R in glial and sensory cells of the spinal cord in STZ-diabetic rats reinforce the idea that kinin B1R is an important target for drug development in pain processes.

The mechanisms underlying this impairment are not well understood, but brain dopamine systems have been implicated. Here, we test whether one night of sleep deprivation changes dopamine brain activity. We studied 15 healthy subjects using positron emission tomography and [C-11] raclopride (dopamineD(2)/D-3 receptor radioligand) and [C-11] cocaine (dopamine transporter radioligand). Subjects were tested twice: after one night of rested sleep and after one night of sleep deprivation. The specific binding of [C-11] raclopride in the striatum and thalamus were significantly reduced after sleep deprivation and the magnitude of this reduction correlated with increases in fatigue (tiredness and sleepiness) and with deterioration in cognitive performance (visual attention and working memory). In contrast, sleep deprivation did not affect the specific binding of [C-11] cocaine in the striatum. Because [C-11] raclopride competes with endogenous dopamine for binding to D-2/D-3 receptors, we interpret the decreases in binding to reflect dopamine increases with sleep deprivation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that decreased [C-11] raclopride binding reflects decreases in receptor levels or affinity. Sleep deprivation did not affect dopamine transporters (target for most wake-promoting medications) and thus dopamine increases are likely to reflect increases in dopamine cell firing and/or release rather than decreases in dopamine reuptake. Because dopamine-enhancing drugs increase wakefulness, we postulate that dopamine increases after sleep deprivation is a mechanism by which the brain maintains arousal as the drive to sleep increases but one that is insufficient to counteract behavioral and cognitive impairment.

[C-11]PE2I is used in positron emission tomography (PET) for examination of the dopamine neuronal transporter (DAT). DAT radioligands are often used to evaluate the progression of Parkinson's disease or the efficiency of neuroprotective therapeutics, and, typically, these studies required several successive PET scans. Methods: In three healthy male volunteers, whole-body scans were performed up to 2 h following intravenous injection of 321 +/- 6 MBq of [C-11]PE2I. For each subject, regions of interest were defined over all visible organs to generate time-activity curves and calculate the percentage of injected activity. Time-activity data were fitted to a monoexponential model, as an uptake phase followed by a monoexponential washout, or bi-exponential model to obtain residence times. With the use of the MIRD method, several source organs were considered in estimating residence time and mean effective radiation absorbed doses. Results: Blood pressure and ECG findings remained unchanged after radioligand injection. The primary route of clearance was renal. Ten minutes after injection, high activities were observed in the kidneys, urinary-bladder, stomach, liver, salivary glands and brain. The urine bladder wall, stomach and liver received the highest absorbed doses. The average effective dose of [C-11]PE2I was estimated to be 6.4 +/- 0.6 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusion: The amount of [(11)]PE2I required for adequate DAT PET imaging results in an acceptable effective dose equivalent permitting two or three repeated cerebral PET studies, with the injection of 222 MBq for each study.

This study has investigated muscarinic cholinergic M1-M5 receptor subtype expression in striatum of Fischer 344 rats aged 6 (young), 15 (adult) and 22 months (senescent) to assess the contribution of different muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes in age-related changes of striatal cholinergic neurotransmission. Western blot analysis revealed the expression of the M1-M5 muscarinic receptor subtytpes in the striatum of rats of the three age groups investigated. Both radioligand binding assay and light microscope autoradiography showed in young rats a M4 > M1 > M2 > M3 > M5 rank order of receptor density. With the exception of M1 receptor. the density of which is similar in the dorsal (motor) and ventral (limbic) striatum, other receptor subtypes were more abundant in ventral than in dorsal striatum. M1 receptor expression was unchanged between young and adult rats and decreased in senescent animals both in dorsal and ventral striatum. In dorsal striatum M2 and M5 receptor expression did not show age-related changes, whereas in ventral striatum it was slightly decreased in adult rats compared to young or senescent cohorts. M3 receptor expression did not show age-related modifications. whereas a progressive age-related decrease of M4 receptor was found, both in dorsal and ventral striatum. These data indicate a heterogeneous response to age of different muscarinic receptor subtypes. Striatal cholinergic markers are thought to correlate with cognitive impairment in aged rats. In view of this, the identification of age-related changes of striatal muscarinic receptor subtypes may contribute to develop cholinergic strategies to counter cholinergic neurotransmission changes occurring with aging.

Recently we established the experimental conditions that allowed the identification of [H-3]thiocolchicoside binding sites in synaptic membranes of rat spinal cord and cerebral cortex. The pharmacological characterization of these sites indicated that GABA and several of its agonists and antagonists, as well as strychnine, were able to interact with [H-3]thiocolchicoside binding in a dose-dependent manner and with different affinities. In order to gain more insight into the nature and the anatomical distribution of the binding sites labeled by [H-3]thiocolchicoside. in the present study we examined the localization of these sites on parasagittal and coronal sections of the rat brain and spinal cord, respectively, using receptor autoradiography. In the spinal cord an intense signal was observed in the gray matter, with the highest density occurring in the superficial layers of the dorsal horns. Strychnine completely displaced [H-3] thiocolchicoside binding, whereas GABA only partially removed the radioligand from its binding sites. In the brain, specific binding occurred in several areas and was displaced by both GABA and strychnine. The distribution of [H-3]thiocolchicoside binding sites in brain sections, however, did not match that found for [H-3]muscimol. Furthermore, cold thiocolchicoside was not able to completely displace [H-3]muscimol binding, and showed a different efficacy in the various areas labeled by the radioligand. We conclude that thiocolchicoside may interact with a subpopulation of GABA, receptors having low-affinity binding sites for GABA, Furthermore, the observed sensitivity to strychnine in the spinal cord indicates an interaction also with strychnine-sensitive glycine receptors, suggesting that the pharmacological effects of thiocolchicoside may be the result of its interaction with different receptor populations.

In order to further characterize the adenosine binding sites that we previously purified and termed P3 purinergic receptor-like protein (P3LP), a reliable binding assay method was developed using [H-3]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) as a radioligand and the newly developed high-affinity selective ligand 9-(6,7-dideoxy-beta -D-allo-hept-5-ynofuranosyl) adenine (HAK2701) as a selective displacer. 2. Using this assay method, it was found that rat brain membranes possess high- and low-affinity [H-3]-NECA binding sites. The high-affinity binding site showed K-D and B-max values of 19.7 +/- 2.5 nmol/L and 0.192 +/- 0.05 pmol/mg protein, respectively, and the K-D value for the low-affinity binding site was 4260 +/- 330 nmol/L. The K-D value for the high-affinity site agreed well with that of the [H-3]-NECA binding site determined with the partially purified P3LP preparation described previously. 3. The distribution of P3LP in rat tissues was determined using the [H-3]-NECA binding method described above. The highest level of P3LP was in the cerebellum followed by the olfactory bulb and the spinal cord. 4. The order of the affinity for various purinergic or related compounds to P3LP in rat brain preparations was also determined by the [H-3]-NECA binding method to he HAK2701 > NECA = adenosine 5'-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) > cAMP = beta,gamma -methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate > diadenosine tetraphosphate > alpha,beta -methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate > 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine > N-6-cyclopentyladenosine. 5. These studies reveal that the [H-3]-NECA binding assay in combination with HAK2701 is successful in the characterization of P3LP, especially the membrane-bound form.

As compared with C-11-N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-methylphenyl) nortropane (C-11-PE2I), F-18-FE-PE2I shows faster kinetics and more favorable metabolism, with less production of a radiometabolite with intermediate lipophilicity (M1), which-in the case of C-11-PE2I-has been shown to enter the rat brain. In this study, we compared DAT quantification with C-11-PE2I and F-18-FE-PE2I in nonhuman primates, using kinetic and graphical analysis with the input function of both the parent and the radiometabolite, to assess the potential contribution of the radiometabolite. Methods: Three rhesus monkeys were examined with C-11-PE2I and F-18-FE-PE2I using the HRRT system. Arterial input functions of the parent and radiometabolite M1 were measured. Kinetic and graphical analyses were applied using either the parent input (methods 1 and 3) or the parent plus radiometabolite input (methods 2 and 4). Outcome measures were distribution volumes (V-T and V-ND), specific-to-nondisplaceable tissue radioactivity ratio at equilibrium (BPND; parent input), and specific-to-nondisplaceable tissue radioactivity ratio at equilibrium in the presence of metabolites (R-T; parent plus radiometabolite input). Results: C-11-PE2I showed higher distribution volumes than F-18-FE-PE2I calculated with methods 1 and 3 (striatal V-T, similar to 300%; V-ND in cerebellum, similar to 30%). With methods 2 and 4, V-T in the striatum was approximately 60% higher in the case of C-11-PE2I, whereas no difference in V-ND was found in the cerebellum. For each radioligand, BPND estimated with methods 1 and 3 tended to be higher than R-T estimated with methods 2 and 4. However, the bias of BPND, compared with R-T, was much larger for C-11-PE2I (40%-60% in the caudate and putamen) than for F-18-FE-PE2I (, 10% in the caudate and putamen). Conclusion: The direct comparison between the radioligands confirmed that F-18-FEPE2I shows faster kinetics and more favorable metabolism than C-11-PE2I. The kinetic and graphical analyses with the input function of the parent and radiometabolite showed that the bias in BPND was much lower for F-18-FE-PE2I than for C-11-PE2I and suggested that the lower production of the radiometabolite M1 would make F-18-FE-PE2I more suitable for the DAT quantification. Further studies in humans are necessary to confirm these findings.

The benzoyl amide moiety of LY2456302 was changed into N-hydroxybenzamide and benzisoxazole-3(2H)-one to investigate whether it could increase the binding affinity or selectivity for KOR. All target compounds were evaluated in radioligand binding assays for opioid receptor binding affinity. These efforts led to the identification of compound lc (kappa K-i = 179.9 nM), which exhibited high affinity for KOR. Moreover, the selectivity of KOR over MOR and DOR increased nearly 2-fold and 7-fold, respectively, compared with ( +/- )LY2456302.

Synthesis of 3-cyano-2-fluoropyridines	JOURNAL OF FLUORINE CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Fluoropyridines; Synthesis; Nucleophilic substitution	ONE-POT SYNTHESIS; REGIOSELECTIVE SYNTHESIS; NITRILE CYCLIZATION; SULFONIUM SALTS; HETEROCYCLES; FLUORINATION; RADIOLIGAND; NUCLEOSIDES; ACIDS	The synthesis of 3-cyano-2-fluoropyridines from readily available precursors was achieved via nucleophilic substitution of a leaving group in the 2-postion with KF or BU4NF in polar aprotic solvents such as DMF and DMSO. Ionic tetrahydrothiophenium fragment is the most effective leaving group, the methanesulfonyl moiety is a somewhat less effective, and Br- and Cl- are the least effective. Relatively mild conditions of the reaction between (2-pyridyl)-tetrahydrothiophenium salts and KF, as well as the convenience of one-step synthesis of these salts from 2(1H)-pyridinethiones, make these salts the compounds of choice for the preparation of ring-fluorinated pyridines.

We aimed to identify clinical or PSMA-targeted imaging-derived parameters to predict hematological adverse events at early and late stages in the treatment course. Methods In 67 patients with mCRPC scheduled for Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT, pretherapeutic osseous tumor volume (TV) from Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT and laboratory values were assessed. We then tested the predictive capability of these parameters for early and late hematotoxicity (according to CTCAE vers. 5.0) after one cycle of RLT and in a subgroup of 32/67 (47.8%) patients after four cycles of RLT. Results After one cycle, 10/67 (14.9%) patients developed leukocytopenia (lymphocytopenia, 39/67 [58.2%]; thrombocytopenia, 17/67 [25.4%]). A cut-off of 5.6 x 10(3)/mm(3) for baseline leukocytes was defined by receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and separated between patients with and without leukocytopenia (P < 0.001). Baseline leukocyte count emerged as a stronger predictive factor in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 33.94, P = 0.001) relative to osseous TV (HR, 14.24, P = 0.01). After four cycles, 4/32 (12.5%) developed leukocytopenia and the pretherapeutic leukocyte cut-off (HR, 9.97, P = 0.082) tended to predict leukocytopenia better than TV (HR, 8.37, P = 0.109). In addition, a cut-off of 1.33 x 10(3)/mm(3) for baseline lymphocytes separated between patients with and without lymphocytopenia (P < 0.001), which was corroborated in multivariate analysis (HR, 21.39, P < 0.001 vs. TV, HR, 4.57, P = 0.03). After four cycles, 19/32 (59.4%) developed lymphocytopenia and the pretherapeutic cut-off for lymphocytes (HR, 46.76, P = 0.007) also demonstrated superior predictive performance for late lymphocytopenia (TV, HR, 5.15, P = 0.167). Moreover, a cut-off of 206 x 10(3)/mm(3) for baseline platelets separated between patients with and without thrombocytopenia (P < 0.001) and also demonstrated superior predictive capability in multivariate analysis (HR, 115.02, P < 0.001 vs.TV, HR, 12.75, P = 0.025). After four cycles, 9/32 (28.1%) developed thrombocytopenia and the pretherapeutic cut-off for platelets (HR, 5.44, P = 0.048) was also superior for the occurrence of late thrombocytopenia (TV, HR, 1.44, P = 0.7). Conclusions Pretherapeutic leukocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet levels themselves are strong predictors for early and late hematotoxicity under PSMA-directed RLT, and are better suited than PET-based osseous TV for this purpose.

New GABA/Glutamate Receptor Target for [<SUP>3</SUP>H]Isoxazoline Insecticide	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							GATED CHLORIDE CHANNEL; BINDING-SITES; AVERMECTINS; EXCHANGE; PROGRESS; DRUGS	The highly effective and selective isoxazoline insecticide A1443 is known to potently displace [H-3]ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([H-3]EBOB) binding to house fly head membranes with an IC50 of 0.2 nM in a manner characteristic of GABA-gated chloride channel antagonists. To further define its mode of action, we prepared phenyl-labeled [H-3]A1443 as described with a specific activity of 14 Ci/mmol. This new radioligand with an apparent IC50 of about 0.4 nM is poorly displaced by most insecticides acting at the [H-3]EBOB site. Interestingly, the isoxazoline binding site is directly coupled to the avermectin GABA/glutamate chloride channel activator site. These findings revive interest in the insect GABA/glutamate receptor as an insecticide target.

[C-11]Metergoline had moderate brain uptake and exhibited heterogeneous specific binding, which was blocked by pretreatment with metergoline and altanserin throughout the cortex. Non-specific binding and insensitivity to changes in synaptic serotonin limit its potential as a PET radiotracer.

When the cortical cells were incubated in vitro with chicken adrenocorticotropic hormone (cACTH) in the presence of cPTHrP, greater production of corticosterone was observed than when incubated with cACTH alone. The results suggest that PTHrP may act directly on the adrenocortical cells via its receptor binding and increase the response to ACTH for corticosterone secretion in the hen.

The underlying molecular mechanism was assessed by electrophysiological, radioligand, and functional experiments. The FST results showed that acute administration (40 mg/kg) of (+)-catharanthine or (-)-18-MC induces similar antidepressantlike activity in male and female mice at 1 h and 24 h, whereas the TST results showed a lower effect for (-)-18-MC at 24 h. Repeated treatment at lower dose (20 mg/kg) augmented the efficacy of both congeners. The FST results showed that (-)-18-MC reduces immobility and increases swimming times without changing climbing behavior, whereas (+)-catharanthine reduces immobility time, increases swimming times more markedly, and increases climbing behavior. To investigate the contribution of the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters in the antidepressant effects of (+)-catharanthine and (-)-18-MC, we conducted in vitro radioligand and functional studies. Results obtained demonstrated that (+)-catharanthine inhibits norepinephrine transporter with higher potency/ affinity than that for (-)-18-MC, whereas both congeners inhibit serotonin transporter with similar potency/affinity. Moreover, whereas no congener activated/inhibited/potentiated the function of serotonin receptor 3A or serotonin receptor 3AB, both increased serotonin receptor 3A receptor desensitization. Depletion of serotonin decreased the antidepressant-like activity of both congeners, whereas norepinephrine depletion only decreased (+)-catharanthine's activity. Our study shows that coronaridine congeners induce antidepressant-like activity in a dose- and time-dependent, and sex-independent, manner. The antidepressant-like property of both compounds involves serotonin transporter inhibition, without directly activating/inhibiting serotonin receptors 3, while (+)-catharanthine also mobilizes norepinephrinergic neurotransmission.

Imaging α4β2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (nAChRs) in Baboons with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]XTRA, a Radioligand with Improved Specific Binding in Extra-Thalamic Regions	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; PET imaging; Radioligands; Non-human primates; Dosimetry; Binding potential	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; LEWY BODIES; IN-VIVO; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; PET; DEMENTIA; BIODISTRIBUTION; QUANTIFICATION	Currently available positron-emitting radiotracers for imaging of the alpha 4 beta 2 subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) exhibit high and moderate specific binding in the thalamus and extra-thalamic brain regions, respectively. In many neuropsychiatric disorders, alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs are altered in the extra-thalamic brain regions, but not necessarily in the thalamus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate [F-18]XTRA, a new alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand with improved specific binding in extra-thalamic brain regions, in non-human primates. The regional distribution of [F-18]XTRA in the brain of Papio anubis baboons was evaluated in baseline and blocking experiments. Various PET modeling procedures were used for determination of volume of distribution (V (T)), binding potential (BPND), and receptor occupancy. Radiation dosimetry for [F-18]XTRA was studied in male CD-1 mice and extrapolated to human dosimetry estimates using OLINDA/EXM software. [F-18]XTRA was synthesized using an automated radiochemistry module with 25 % decay-corrected radiochemical yield. [F-18]XTRA readily enters the baboon brain and specifically labels alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs. Mathematical modeling demonstrates high binding potential values (BPND = 7 and 1.3 in the thalamus and frontal cortex, respectively). A PET scanning time of 90-120 min was sufficient to obtain stable V (T) values in the extra-thalamic regions. The extrapolated human effective dose was 0.041 mSv/MBq (0.15 Rem/mCi). [F-18]XTRA exhibits improved specific binding in the baboon brain including extra-thalamic regions and it is considered radiologically acceptable for human studies. Further evaluations of [F-18]XTRA in human subjects are under way.

Herein, two potent and selective C-11-labeled VAChT inhibitors were evaluated in rodents and nonhuman primates for imaging VAChT in vivo. For both (-)-[C-11]2 and (-)-[C-11]6, biodistribution, autoradiography, and metabolism studies were performed in male Sprague Dawley rats. Positron emission tomography (PET) brain studies with (-)-[C-11]2 were performed in adult male cynomolgus macaques; 2 h dynamic data was acquired, and the regions of interest were drawn by co-registration of the PET images with the MRI. The resolved enantiomers (-)-2 and (-)-6 were very potent and selective for VAChT in vitro (K (i) < 5 nM for VAChT with > 35-fold selectivity for VAChT vs. sigma receptors); both radioligands, (-)-[C-11]2 and (-)-[C-11]6, demonstrated high accumulation in the VAChT-enriched striatum of rats. (-)-[C-11]2 had a higher striatum to cerebellum ratio of 2.4-fold at 60 min; at 30 min, striatal uptake reached 0.550 +/- 0.086 %ID/g. Uptake was also specific and selective; following pretreatment with (+/-)-2, striatal uptake of (-)-[C-11]2 in rats at 30 min decreased by 50 %, while pretreatment with a potent sigma ligand had no significant effect on striatal uptake in rats. In addition, (-)-[C-11]2 displayed favorable in vivo stability in rat blood and brain. PET studies of (-)-[C-11]2 in nonhuman primates indicate that it readily crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and provides clear visualization of the striatum; striatal uptake reaches the maximum at 60 min, at which time the target to nontarget ratio reached similar to 2-fold.

The influence of different cellular environments on PET radioligand binding: An application to D<sub>2/3</sub>-dopamine receptor imaging	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						D-2/3 receptor; PET; Internalisation; [H-3]PhNO; [H-3]Raclopride; [H-3]Spiperone	INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; IN-VIVO; D-3 RECEPTORS; LIGAND-BINDING; AMPHETAMINE; INTERNALIZATION; ENDOCYTOSIS; SODIUM; RAT; INHIBITION	Various D-2/3 receptor PET radioligands are sensitive to endogenous dopamine release in vivo. The Occupancy Model is generally used to interpret changes in binding observed in in vivo competition binding studies; an Internalisation Hypothesis may also contribute to these changes in signal. Extension of in vivo competition imaging to other receptor systems has been relatively unsuccessful. A greater understanding of the cellular processes underlying signal changes following endogenous neurotransmitter release may help translate this imaging paradigm to other receptor systems. To investigate the Internalisation Hypothesis we assessed the effects of different cellular environments, representative of those experienced by a receptor following agonist-induced internalisation, on the binding of three D-2/3 PET ligands with previously reported sensitivities to endogenous dopamine in vivo, namely [H-3]spiperone, [H-3]raclopride and [H-3]PhNO. Furthermore, we determined the contribution of each cellular compartment to total striatal binding for these D-2/3 ligands. These studies suggest that sensitivity to endogenous dopamine release in vivo is related to a decrease in affinity in the endosomal environment compared with those found at the cell surface. In agreement with these findings we also demonstrate that similar to 25% of total striatal binding for [H-3]spiperone originates from sub-cellular, microsomal receptors, whereas for [H-3]raclopride and [H-3]PhNO, this fraction is lower, representing similar to 14% and 17%, respectively. This pharmacological approach is fully translatable to other receptor systems. Assessment of affinity shifts in different cellular compartments may play a crucial role for understanding if a radioligand is sensitive to endogenous release in vivo, for not just the D-2/3, but other receptor systems.

Of all 11 known phosphodiesterase families, phosphodiesterase-10A (PDE10A) has the most restricted distribution, with high expression in the striatum. PDE10A inhibitors are pursued as drugs for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We have synthesized and evaluated F-18-JNJ41510417 as a selective and high-affinity radioligand for in vivo brain imaging of PDE10A using PET. Methods: The biodistribution of F-18-JNJ41510417 was evaluated in rats. Rat plasma and perfused brain homogenates were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography to quantify radiometabolites. Dynamic small-animal PET was performed in rats and in wild-type and PDE10A knock-out mice and compared with ex vivo autoradiography. Blocking and displacement experiments were performed using the nonradioactive analog and other selective PDE10A inhibitors. Results: Tissue distribution studies showed predominant hepatobiliary excretion, sufficient brain uptake (0.56 +/- 0.00 percentage injected dose at 2 min after tracer injection), and continuous accumulation of the tracer in the striatum over time; rapid washout of nonspecific binding from other brain regions was observed. Polar radiometabolites were detected in plasma and brain tissue. Dynamic small-animal PET showed continuous tracer accumulation in the striatum, with rapid decline in the cortex and cerebellum. Pretreatment and chase experiments with PDE10A inhibitors showed that the tracer binding to PDE10A was specific and reversible. Imaging in PDE10A knock-out and wild-type mice further confirmed that binding in the striatum was specific for PDE10A. Conclusion: Experiments in rats and PDE10A knock-out mice indicate that F-18-JNJ41510417 binds specifically and reversibly to PDE10A in the striatum, suggesting that this new fluorinated quinoline derivative is a promising candidate for in vivo imaging of PDE10A using PET.

However, the mechanism of ECT is still poorly understood. Although several lines of studies have focused on its effect on dopamine neurotransmission, the effects of ECT on dopamine D-2 receptors in a living human brain have not been investigated. Using positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the radioligand [C-11] FLB 457, we aimed to evaluate the effect of ECT on extrastriatal D-2 receptor binding in medicated patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Method: Seven patients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of MDD underwent PET scans before and after a series of 6-7 treatments with bilateral ECT. Eleven healthy controls were scanned for comparison. All participants were scanned at the National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan, between November 2000 and September 2005. The parametric images of II ICIFLB 457 binding were generated on the basis of a simplified reference tissue model. Voxel-based methods were used to assess the effect of ECT on D-2 receptor binding. Results: There were no significant differences in D-2 receptor binding between patients with MDD and controls. All 7 patients showed clinical improvements in response to ECT treatment (P <.001). Significant changes in D2 receptor binding, a mean of 25.2% reduction, were found in the right rostra] anterior cingulate (AC) following ECT (P<.001). Conclusions: Electroconvulsive therapy decreased D2 receptor binding in the rostral AC in MDD patients responding to ECT. Our finding suggests that one of the biologic mechanisms of ECT could be related to dopaminergic alteration in the rostral AC.

The aim of the present study was to examine how ligands selective for NK1, NK2 and NK3 receptors affect the gerbil foot tap response. Agonists selective for NK receptor subtypes were administered i.c.v. and the gerbil foot tap response was monitored. The effect of systemically administered antagonists was also studied. The interaction of ligands with gerbil NK, receptors was evaluated using autoradiography on gerbil brain slices with [H-3]-Sar,Met(O-2)-substance P or [H-3]GR205171 as radioligand. The effects of ligands on NK1 and NK3 receptor-mediated increases in intracellular calcium in vitro were studied in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the cloned gerbil receptors. The selective NK1 receptor agonist ASMSP and the selective NK3 receptor agonist senktide induced dose-dependent increases in gerbil foot tapping with similar potency. The maximal effect of senktide was approximately 40% of the maximal response evoked by ASMP. The effects of ASMSP and senktide were blocked by administration of the selective NK1 receptor antagonist CP99,994 (10 mu mol/kg s.c.). The effects of senktide, but not ASMSP, were blocked by administration of the selective NK3 receptor antagonist SB223412 (50 mu mol/kg i.p.). Senktide did not displace NK1 receptor radioligand binding and was > 1000-fold less potent than ASMSP at activating gerbil NK1 receptors. The selective NK3 receptor agonist senktide evokes fear-related gerbil foot tapping, an effect which probably involves indirect enhancement of NK1 receptor signalling. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It competed poorly for I-125-Ang II binding in bovine brain but potently antagonized dipsogenic responses to intracerebroventricularly administered Ang II. Subsequent recognition that bovine brain contains AT(2) receptors, while dipsogenic responses to Ang II are mediated by AT(1) receptors, suggests that Sar(1),Gly(8) Ang II is AT(1) selective. Sar(1),Gly(8) Ang II competed for I-125-sarcosine(1),isoleucine(8) Ang II binding to AT(1) receptors in pituitary, liver and adrenal (the latter with the AT(2) selective antagonist PD 123,319) with K-i's of 0.66, 1.40 and 1.36 nM, respectively. In contrast, the K-i of Sar(1),Gly(8) Ang II for AT(2) receptors in rat adrenal (with the selective AT(1) antagonist losartan) was 52 nM. I-125-Sar(1),Gly(8) Ang II (0.5-3 nM) bound to AT(1) receptors in pituitary, liver, heart, adrenal, and hypothalamic membranes with high affinity (K-d=0.43, 1.6, 2.3, 0.96 and 1.8 nM, respectively), but showed no saturable binding to the adrenal AT(2) receptor. I-125-Sar(1),Gly(8) Ang II selectively labeled AT(1) receptors in sections of adrenal using receptor autoradiography. Thus, binding studies reveal Sar',Gly8 Ang II to be the first angiotensin peptide analog to show AT(1) receptor selectivity. I-125-Sar(1),Gly(8) Ang II offers a new means to selectively radiolabel AT(1) receptors and may help to characterize ligand docking sites and agonist switches for AT(1) versus AT(2) receptors.

J	Chowdhury, P; Rayford, PL				Chowdhury, P; Rayford, PL			Effect of food restriction on plasma cholecystokinin levels and exocrine pancreatic function in rats	ANNALS OF CLINICAL AND LABORATORY SCIENCE			English	Article						food restriction; cholecystokinin release; cholecystokinin receptors; radioligand binding	OBSTRUCTIVE-JAUNDICE; AMYLASE SECRETION; PROTEIN; ACINI; BINDING; ANTAGONIST; RECEPTORS; GROWTH	The objective of this study was to examine the effects of 10% food restriction on body weight, plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) levels, and exocrine pancreatic function in male Sprague-Dawley rats. A matched group of rats with unrestricted access to food served as controls. After ingesting the diets for 32 da, the rats were killed and blood obtained for plasma cholecystokinin, glucose, and insulin determinations. To evaluate pancreatic function, the pancreases were removed, weighed, and digested with collagenase to isolate pancreatic acini, which were incubated with maximal stimulating dose of CCK. The fraction of amylase that was released into the medium was measured. To explore the role of membrane receptors in exocrine pancreatic secretion, CCK receptor affinity and CCK receptor capacity were determined by radioligand binding assays in isolated, purified membranes from pancreatic acini. Compared to the control group, rats with 10% food restriction showed (a) reduced body weight gain, (b) increased pancreatic weight, (c) increased plasma CCK level, and (d) no significant changes in plasma glucose or insulin levels. The food-restricted group showed a reduction of pancreatic function, assessed by measuring amylase release in response to maximal CCK stimulation; the amylase release was diminished by 35% in the food-restricted group. In isolated acinar cell membranes from food-restricted rats, CCK receptor affinity and capacity were reduced by 23% and 16%, respectively, compared to controls. These results indicate that consumption of less food than normal affects pancreatic function by a mechanism that evidently involves CCK release and down-regulation of CCK receptors. The data suggest that CCK plays an important physiological role in the adaptation to eating less food, and thereby to the lowering of body weight in rats and, possibly, in other animals.

Drugs that block dopamine (DA) uptake have generally been found to function as positive reinforcers. Benztropine (BZT) and several of its halogenated analogs have previously been characterized as potent DA-uptake inhibitors with behavioral profiles that indicate diminished psychomotor stimulant effects relative to cocaine. Objectives: The present experiments were designed to examine, in rhesus monkeys, the reinforcing effects of the DA-uptake inhibitor BZT and two chloro-analogs 3'-C1-BZT and 4'-Cl-BZT, and to compare self-administration and binding profiles. Methods: Four rhesus monkeys self-administered cocaine i.v. under a fixed-ratio 10 (FRIO) schedule until stable responding was established. Saline, and various doses of cocaine, BZT, and the BZT analogs were then made available for self-administration. Binding of these compounds to monoaminergic and cholinergic sites in monkey brain were determined using standard radioligand binding techniques. Results: Self-administration was maintained by both 3'-C1-BZT and 4'-Cl-BZT, but not by BZT. Results suggested that 3'-Cl-BZT and 4'-Cl-BZT were weak positive reinforcers. BZT and analogs bound DA transporters (DAT) with affinities higher than that of cocaine and had affinity for muscarinic binding sites. Conclusions: Surprisingly, high affinity at DATs was associated with weak or no reinforcing effects. The mechanism(s) that may underlie this dissociation between DAT actions and reinfurcino effects remains to be established.

A recent study evaluated the prog-nostic value of whole-body tumor volume using a semiautomatic method relying on a 50% threshold of lesion SUVmax (PSMATV50). In the present study, we analyzed the suitability of this approach com-paring 18F-PSMA-1007 with 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT scans and the potential of PSMATV50 for the prediction of overall survival (OS) in patients before 177Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy (RLT). Moreover, PSMATV50 was integrated into the PSMA PET/CT consensus state-ment as well as RECIP 1.0, and the prognostic value of these response classification systems was compared. Methods: This ret-rospective study included 70 patients with metastatic castration -resistant prostate cancer undergoing PSMA RLT. Thirty-three patients were monitored by 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, and 37 patients by 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. PET/CT scans before (baseline) and at the end of PSMA RLT after 2-4 cycles (follow-up) were separately analyzed by 2 readers. PSMATV50 at baseline and its change at the time of follow-up (APSMATV50, expressed as a ratio) were correlated with OS using Cox proportional-hazards regression. The results of both subgroups were compared. The integration of APSMATV50 in existing response classification systems was evaluated. To assess and compare the discriminatory strength of these classification sys-tems, Goeuronen and Heller concordance probability estimates were calculated. Results: PSMATV50 determination was technically feasi-ble in all examinations. A higher PSMATV50 at baseline and a higher APSMATV50 were strongly associated with a shorter OS for both 68Ga-PSMA-11 (PSMATV50: hazard ratio [HR] of 1.29 [95% CI, 1.05-1.55], P = 0.009; APSMATV50: HR of 1.83 [95% CI, 1.08-3.09], P = 0.024) and 18F-PSMA-1007 (PSMATV50: HR of 1.84 [95% CI, 1.13-2.99], P = 0.014; APSMATV50: HR of 1.23 [95% CI, 1.04-1.51], P = 0.03). Response assessment provided high discriminatory power for OS for the PSMA PET/CT consensus statement (concordance probability estimate, 0.73) as well as RECIP 1.0 (concordance proba-bility estimate, 0.74). Conclusion: PSMATV50 and APSMATV50 proved to be predictive of OS not only for 68Ga-PSMA-11 but also for 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT scans. Subsequent integration of APSMATV50 into the PSMA PET/CT consensus statement and RECIP 1.0 pro-vided equally high prognostic value for both classification systems.

Until today, staging of patients with PCa relied mostly on morphologic features, such as size or shape, resulting in low detection rates in disease recurrence. PSMA PET imaging provides molecular information and, in combination with conventional imaging, offers improved sensitivity and specificity. This article discusses the benefits and limitations of PSMA imaging in the setting of primary staging and detection of recurrent disease in comparison with standard-of-care imaging techniques.

It is involved in modulating a range of physiological functions throughout the brain and periphery through the membrane-bound G protein-coupled receptors, called adenosine receptors (ARs) A(1)AR, A(2A)AR, A(2B)AR, and A(3)AR. These are therefore important targets for neurological, cardiovascular, inflammatory, and autoimmune diseases and are the subject of drug development directed toward the cyclic adenosine monophosphate and other signaling pathways. Initially using public data for A(1)AR agonists we generated and validated a Bayesian machine learning model (Receiver Operator Characteristic of 0.87) that we used to identify molecules for testing. Three selected molecules, crisaborole, febuxostat and paroxetine, showed initial activity in vitro using the HEK293 A(1)AR Nomad cell line. However, radioligand binding, beta-arrestin assay and calcium influx assay did not confirm this A(1)AR activity. Nevertheless, several other AR activities were identified. Febuxostat and paroxetine both inhibited orthosteric radioligand binding in the mu M range for A(2A)AR and A(3)AR. In HEK293 cells expressing the human A(2A)AR, stimulation of cAMP was observed for crisaborole (EC50 2.8 mu M) and paroxetine (EC50 14 mu M), but not for febuxostat. Crisaborole also increased cAMP accumulation in A(2B)AR-expressing HEK293 cells, but it was weaker than at the A(2A)AR. At the human A(3)AR, paroxetine did not show any agonist activity at 100 mu M, although it displayed binding with a K-i value of 14.5 mu M, suggesting antagonist activity. We have now identified novel modulators of A(2A)AR, A(2B)AR and A(3)AR subtypes that are clinically used for other therapeutic indications, and which are structurally distinct from previously reported tool compounds or drugs.

Key features of the synthesis are the introduction of the trifluoromethylsulfonyl and allyl protective groups at the heterocyclic N-atoms. Two methods were developed to convert the triflyl-protected ketone 16 into tricyclic alcohols 21 bearing various N-substituents. According to the first method, trifluoromethanesulfinate was removed by K2CO3. Following the selective reduction of the imino moiety of 17 with NaBH(OAc)(3) afforded the aminoketone 18, which was reductively alkylated and reduced. According to the second method, both the imine and the ketone of the iminoketone 17 were reduced with NaBH4 to yield the aminoalcohol 20, which was alkylated or reductively alkylated to form tertiary amines 21f-21r. In the last step, the allyl protective group of 21 was removed with RhCl3 and HCl to obtain oxazolones 22. In receptor binding studies using [H-3]ifenprodil as radioligand ketone, 22m showed the highest GluN2B affinity (K-i = 88 nM). However, a reduced affinity toward GluN2B subunit-containing N-methyl- d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors was observed for oxazolones 22 compared to bioisosteric 3-benzazepine-1,7-diols. High selectivity of 22m for the ifenprodil binding site of GluN2B-NMDA receptors over the 1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)piperidine binding site and sigma(2) receptors was observed, but only negligible selectivity over sigma(1) receptors. In two-electrode voltage clamp experiments, the 4-phenylbutyl derivative 22d (K-i = 422 nM) demonstrated 80% inhibition of ion flux at a concentration of 1 mu M. The differences in GluN2B affinity and inhibitory activity are explained by docking studies. In conclusion, 22d is regarded as a novel scaffold of highly potent GluN1/GluN2B antagonists.

[F-18]FMH3 was evaluated for imaging central H3R sites in non-human primates through test-retest (TRT) and dose-receptor occupancy studies with two selective H3R antagonists in order to support clinical investigations. Two adult female baboons underwent [F-18]FMH3 PET brain scans in the HR+, at repeated baseline (n = 7) and following administration of escalating doses of ABT-239 (0.003-0.1m/kg, n = 4) and ciproxifan (0.5-2.1 mg/kg, n = 7). Volume of distribution (V-T) in brain regions was estimated using the 2-tissue compartment model. TRT variability of V-T across repeated baseline scans was reported as % coefficient of variation (COV). ABT-239 and ciproxifan occupancy at H3R was estimated using the occupancy plot, and the relationship of occupancy with dose and plasma levels was determined. In baboons, distribution of [F-18]FMH3 was high in the striatum, intermediate in cortical regions, and low in the brain stem. COV of baseline V-T was 7.0 +/- 3.5%, averaged across regions and animals. Dose-dependent effects of ABT-239 and ciproxifan measured the brain. ED50 and EC50, respectively, were 0.011 mg/kg and 0.942 ng/ml for ABT-239 and 0.73 mg/kg and 208.3 ng/ml for ciproxifan. [F-18]FMH3 demonstrated high TRT reliability and can be used to measure occupancy of H3R-targeted drugs. Validation in non-human primates support [F-18]FMH3 PET studies toward clinical investigations of H3R.

Some of them have had a high clinical impact on the treatment of patients with prostate cancer. However, the number of F-18-labeled tracers addressing PSMA is still limited. Therefore, we aimed to develop a radiofluorinated molecule resembling the structure of therapeutic PSMA-617. Methods: The nonradioactive reference compound PSMA-1007 and the precursor were produced by solid-phase chemistry. The radioligand F-18-PSMA-1007 was produced by a 2-step procedure with the prosthetic group 6-F-18-fluoronicotinic acid 2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl ester. The binding affinity of the ligand for PSMA and its internalization properties were evaluated in vitro with PSMA-positive LNCaP (lymph node carcinoma of the prostate) cells. Further, organ distribution studies were performed with mice bearing LNCaP and PC-3 (prostate cancer cell line; PSMA-negative) tumors. Finally, small-animal PET imaging of an LNCaP tumor-bearing mouse was performed. Results: The identified ligand had a binding affinity of 6.7 +/- 1.7 nM for PSMA and an exceptionally high internalization ratio (67% +/- 13%) in vitro. In organ distribution studies, high and specific tumor uptake (8.0 +/- 2.4 percentage injected dose per gram) in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice was observed. In the small-animal PET experiments, LNCaP tumors were clearly visualized. Conclusion: The radiofluorinated PSMA ligand showed promising characteristics in its preclinical evaluation, and the feasibility of prostate cancer imaging was demonstrated by small-animal PET studies.

Methods: In a series of preclinical positron emission tomography measurements, we have administered [C-11]AZ10419369 to mice, rats, and guinea pigs under baseline conditions and, on separate experimental days, after administration of the ABC transporter inhibitor, cyclosporin A (CsA). Results: During baseline conditions, the brain uptake was low in mice and rats, but not in guinea pigs. After CsA pretreatment, the peak whole brain uptake values of [C-11]AZ10419369 increased by 207% in mice, 94% in rats, and 157% in guinea pigs. Binding potentials (BPND) could not be estimated during baseline conditions in mice and rats. After CsA pretreatment, the highest BPND values were obtained in the striatum and thalamus (BPND approximate to 0.4) in mice, while in rats, the highest binding areas were the striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and periaqueductal gray (BPND approximate to 0.5). In guinea pigs, we did not find any significant changes in BPND between baseline and CsA pretreatment, except in the striatum. Conclusions: The results indicate that BBB penetration of [C-11]AZ10419369 was hindered by ABC transporter activity in mouse, rat, and guinea pig. This study highlights the importance of ABC transporters in the design of preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) studies.

Analytical method for simultaneously measuring ex vivo drug receptor occupancy and dissociation rate: Application to (R)-dimethindene occupancy of central histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors	JOURNAL OF RECEPTORS AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION			English	Article						Competition kinetics; Histimine receptor; radioligand binding; receptor occupancy; rat cortex	LIGAND-BINDING; KINETICS; ANTAGONISTS; H-1-RECEPTORS; MODELS	We introduce a novel experimental method to determine both the extent of ex vivo receptor occupancy of administered compound and its dissociation rate constant (k(4)). [Here, we reference k(4) as the rate of offset of unlabeled ligand in convention with Motulsky and Mahan (1)]. We derived a kinetic rate equation based on the dissociation rate constant for an unlabeled compound competing for the same site as a labeled compound and describe a model to simulate fractional occupancy. To validate our model, we performed in vitro kinetics and ex vivo occupancy experiments in rat cortex with varying concentrations of (R)-dimethindene, a sedating antihistamine. Brain tissue was removed at various times post oral administration, and histamine HI receptor ligand [H-3]-doxepin binding to homogenates from drug-treated or vehicle-treated rats was measured at multiple time points at room temperature. Fractional occupancy and k(4) for (R)-dimethindene binding to H I receptors were calculated by using our proposed model. Rats dosed with 30 and 60 mg/kg (R)-dimethindene showed 42% and 67% occupancy of central H1 receptors, respectively. These results were comparable to occupancy data determined by equilibrium radioligand binding. In addition, drug k(4) rate determined by using our ex vivo method was equivalent to k(4)determined by in vitro competition kinetics (dissociation half-life t(1/2) similar to 30 min). The outlined method can be used to assess, by simulation and experiment, occupancy for compounds based on dissociation rate constants and contributes to current efforts in drug optimization to profile antagonist efficacy in terms of its kinetic drug-target binding parameters. Data described by the method may be analyzed with commercially available software. Suggested fitting procedures are given in the appendix.

Labelling and biological evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]methoxy-Sch225336: a radioligand for the cannabinoide-type 2 receptor	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Cannabinoids; CB2 receptor; PET; Carbon-11; Sch225336	TRIARYL BIS-SULFONES; CB2 RECEPTOR; EXPRESSION; RAT; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; MODULATION; LIGANDS; TISSUES; CELLS	Introduction: The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2 receptor) is part of the endocannabinoid system and has been suggested as mediator of a number of central and peripheral inflammatory processes. In the present Study, we have synthesized N-[(Is)-I-[4-[[4-methoxy-2-[(4-[C-11] methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl)-phenyl]sulfonyl] phenyl]ethyl]methanesulfonamide ([C-11]methoxy-Sch225336) and evaluated this new tracer agent as a potential positron emission tomography radioligand for the in vivo visualization of CB2 receptors. Methods: Sch225336 was demethylated and the resulting phenol precursor was radiolabelled with a carbon-11 methyl group by methylation using [C-11]methyl iodide, followed by purification by high-performance liquid chromatography. The log P of [C-11]methoxy-Sch225336 and its biodistribution in normal mice were determined. Enhancement of brain uptake by inhibition of blood-brain barrier (BBB) efflux transporters was studied. Mouse plasma was analysed to quantify the formation of radiometabolites. The affinity of Sch225336 for the human cannabinoid type I and type 2 receptor was determined. Results: [C-11]methoxy-Sch225336 was obtained with a decay corrected radiochemical yield of about 30% and a specific activity of 88.8 GBq/mu mol (end of synthesis). After intravenous injection in mice, the compound is rapidly cleared from the blood through the hepatobiliary pathway and does not show particular retention in any of the major organs. Polar metabolites were found in mouse plasma. Brain uptake was low despite the favourable log P value of 2.15, which is partly due to efflux by BBB pumps. Conclusion: [C-11]methoxy-Sch225336 is a good candidate for in vivo imaging of the CB2 receptor, although the low blood-brain barrier penetration limits its potential for central nervous system imaging.

The B-1 receptor (B1R) subtype is not believed to undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation and endocytosis. A conjugate made of the rabbit B1R fused with the yellow variant of green fluorescent protein (YFP) was expressed in mammalian cells. In COS-1 or human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the construction exhibited a nanomolar affinity for the agonist radioligand [H-3]Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK or the antagonist ligand [H-3]Lys-[Leu(8)]des-Arg(9)-BK and a pharmacological profile virtually identical to that of wild-type B1R. Lys-desArg(9)-BK stimulation of HEK 293 cells stably expressing B1R-YFP but not stimulation of untransfected cells released [H-3]arachidonate in a phospholipase A(2) assay. B1R-YFP was visualized as a continuous labeling of the plasma membranes in stably transfected HEK 293 cells (confocal microscopy). Addition of Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK (1-100 nM) rapidly concentrated the receptor-associated fluorescence into multiple aggregates that remained associated with the plasma membrane (no significant internalization) and colocalized with caveolin-1. This reaction was slowly reversible upon agonist washing at 37degreesC and prevented pretreatment with a B1R antagonist. beta-Cyclodextrin treatment, which extracts cholesterol from membranes and disrupts caveolae-related rafts, prevented agonist-induced redistribution of B1R-YFP but not the PLA(2) activation mediated by this receptor. The agonist radioligand copurified with caveolin-1 to a greater extent than the tritiated antagonist in buoyant fractions of HEK 293 cells treated with the ligands. Agonist-induced cellular translocation of the kinin B1R to caveolae-related rafts without endocytosis is a novel variation on the theme of G protein-coupled receptor adaptation.

Ergopeptides, with their high affinities at D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors, are particularly complex examples. Here, we report the systematic derivatization of two ergopeptides with different peptide-based spacers and their evaluation by radioligand binding assays. Selected spacer-containing ergopeptides with minimal biological alteration and a proper anchoring point were further derivatized with a biotin reporter. Detailed characterization studies identified 13 as a biotin ergopeptide maintaining high affinity and agonist behavior at dopamine receptors, being a useful tool for the study of heteromers involving D1R, D2R, or D3R.

Fourteen PSMA target candidates were synthesized, and binding affinity was evaluated with an in vitro competitive binding assay. First, four compound candidates were selected depending on binding affinity results. Next, we selected four compounds ([Ga-68]1e, [Ga-68]1g, [Ga-68]1h, and [Ga-68]1k) were screened for tumor targeting efficiency by micro-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (micro-PET/CT) imaging. Finally, [Lu-177]1h compound was evaluated the tumor targeting efficiency and therapeutic efficiency by micro-single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (micro-SPECT/CT), biodistribution, and radiotherapy studies. Estimated human effective dose was calculated by biodistribution data. Compound 1h showed a high binding affinity (K-i value = 4.08 +/- 0.08 nmol/L), and [Lu-177]1h showed extended blood circulation (1 hour = 10.32 +/- 0.31, 6 hours = 2.68 +/- 1.07%1D/g) compared to [Lu-177]PSMA-617 (1 h = 0.17 +/- 0.10%ID/g). [Lu-177]1h was excreted via the renal pathway and showed high tumor uptake (24.43 +/- 3.36%ID/g) after 1 hour, which increased over 72 hours (72 hours = 51.39 +/- 9.26%ID/g). Mice treated with 4 and 6 MBq of [Lu-177]1h showed a median survival rate of >61 days. In particular, all mice treated with 6 NA Rq of [Lu-177]1h survived for the entire monitoring period. The estimated human effective dose of [Lu-177]1h was 0.07 +/- 0.01 and 0.03 +/- 0.00 mSv/MBq in total body and kidney, respectively. The current study indicates that [Lu-177]1h has the potential for further investigation of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) therapy in clinical trials.

Methods The number of therapy beds available in German nuclear medicine departments was included in a basic calculation in view of the overall potential for therapy beds to be expected in the event of a possible approval of a therapeutic agent for the Lu-177-PSMA-RLT for mCRPC patients. A potential expansion of the Lu-PSMA-therapy indications was not taken into account. Results The basic calculation shows for a nationwide nuclear medicine bed capacity of approx. 234000 treatment days a relatively small bed reserve of approx. 19000 nuclear medicine bed days, which corresponds to a reserve of 63 beds for the research question. There are regional differences in bed capacity: while for some federal states there is an under-capacity of nuclear medicine therapy beds with an approved Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, this is less the case for other federal states. Discussion This basic calculation shows that the capacity of nuclear medicine therapy beds is likely to be very well utilized with a prospectively approved therapeutic agent for Lu-177-PSMA-RLT, and could even reach its limits in some German federal states. With a prospective expansion of the range of indications or the foreseeable clinical establishment of further therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, the number of therapy beds could represent a bottleneck factor for the comprehensive patient treatment in the medium term.

Their receptors appear to be common, since the five known SRIF receptors (sst1-sst5) have similar subnanomolar affinity for SRIF and CST, whether the short (SRIF-14, CST-14, CST-17) or the long versions (SRIF-28, CST-29) of the peptides. Whether CST targets specific receptors not shared by SRIF, is still debated: MrgX2 has been described as a selective CST receptor, with submicromolar affinity for CST but devoid of affinity for SRIF; however the distribution of CST and MrgX2 is largely different, and there is no MrgX2 in rodents. A similar situation arises with the GHS receptor GHS-R1a, which displays some preferential affinity for CST over SRIF, but for which there is no evidence that it is activated by CST in vivo. In both cases, one may argue that submicromolar affinity is not the norm of a GPCR for its endogenous neuropeptide. On the other hand, all receptors known to bind SRIF have similar high affinity for CST and both peptides act as potent agonists at the sst1-sst5 receptors, whichever transduction pathway is considered. In addition, [I-125][Tyr(10)]CST14 labels sst1-sst5 receptors with subnanomolar affinity, and [I-125][Tyr(10)]CST14 binding in the brain is overlapping with that of [I-125] [Tyr(0)] SRIF14. The functional differences reported that distinguish CST from SRIF, have not been explained convincingly and may relate to ligand-driven transductional selectivity, and other complicating factors such as receptor dimerisation, (homo or heterodimerisation), and/or the influence of accessory proteins (GIPs, RAMPS), which remain to be studied in more detail.

The in vivo distribution correlated with the anatomical localisation of receptors detected in vitro using [I-125]-ET-1. However, the receptor density visualised in the heart was unexpectedly low compared with that predicted from the in vitro measurements. 5 [F-18]-ET-1 binding in lungs could not be displaced by the ETB selective antagonist BQ788, in agreement with the proposed internalisation of ET-1 by ETB receptors. In contrast, infusion of BQ788 prior to injecting [F-18]-ET-1 significantly reduce the amount of radioligand visualised in the ETB rich lung and kidney by 85% (P < 0.05, n=3) and 55% (P < 0.05, n=3), respectively. 6 Under conditions of ETB receptor blockade, the heart could be visualised by microPET imaging. 7 These results suggest that clearance by ETB receptors in the lung and kidney prevents binding of ET-1 to receptors in the heart.

The current study quantified the distribution of activity in two rhesus monkeys after the injection of approximately 333 MBq (9 mCi) C-11-DASB. Whole-body images were acquired at 22 time points for a total of 120 min following injection of the radioligand. Source organs were identified at each time point from both tomographic images (using multiple regions of interest on each tomograph for each organ) and a single planar image (using a single region of interest for each organ). The peak activities in planar images in the five identified source organs (expressed as per cent injected dose (ID)) were lungs (24% ID at 1.5 min), kidneys (6.5% ID at 4 min), liver (8% ID at 3 min), brain (4% ID at 5 min) and spleen (0.42% ID at 3 min). Mono-exponential fitting of activity overlying the bladder suggested that approximately 14% of activity was excreted via the urine. The radiation burden to the body was calculated from residence times of these source organs and then scaled to corresponding human values. The calculated effective dose from tomographic and planar images was 6.0 and 6.4 muGy(.)MBq(-1) (22.3 and 23.7 mrad(.)mCi(-1)), respectively. The planar analysis was much easier to perform, and generally yielded slightly higher (i.e., more conservative) estimates of radiation burden than the tomographic analysis. The estimated radiation burden of C-11-DASB is relatively modest and would allow multiple scans per research subject per year. ((C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins).

We therefore compared [H-3]N/OFQ binding in dog and rat brain membranes. Radioligand saturation/ competition studies with these membranes and leucyl-[H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH or the novel radioligand [H-3]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 were performed to determine receptor density and ligand affinity. The density of classic opioid receptors was determined by using [H-3]diprenorphine. Leucyl[[H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH(1-17)OH binding was concentration dependent and saturable in dog (maximum binding capacity [B-max], 28.7 +/- 2.8 fmol/mg of protein; equilibrium dissociation constant as negative log [pK(d)], 10.27 +/- 0.11) and rat (B-max, 137.0 +/- 12.9 fmol/mg of protein; pK(d), 10.41 +/- 0.05). In comparison, the B-max and pK(d), of [H-3]diprenorphine were, respectively, 77.7 +/- 5.3 fmol/mg of protein and 9.74 +/- 0.09 in dog and 79.1 +/- 18.2 fmol/mg of protein and 9.51 +/- 0.04 in rat. In dog, [(3) H]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 binding to NOP receptors was also saturable (B-max, 23.7 +/- 2.0 fmol/mg of protein; pK(d), 10.16 +/- 0.12). In both species, leucyl-[H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH was displaced by various NOP ligands. Dynorphin A, N/OFQ(1-5)NH2, and nocistatin were essentially inactive. There was a significant positive correlation (r(2) = 0.95; P < 0.0001) between pK(i) values (an estimate of affinity) obtained in displacement studies in rat and dog. We have demonstrated a low density of NOP receptors, measured with two radioligands, in dog, and these receptors display a high degree of pharmacological similarity with those natively expressed in the rat.

Molecular Basis of Ligand Dissociation from the Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> Receptor	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; BINDING-KINETICS; RESIDUES; ANTAGONISTS; TIOTROPIUM; ZM241385; PATHWAY	How drugs dissociate from their targets is largely unknown. We investigated the molecular basis of this process in the adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R), a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Through kinetic radioligand binding experiments, we characterized mutant receptors selected based on molecular dynamic simulations of the antagonist ZM241385 dissociating from the A(2A)R. We discovered mutations that dramatically altered the ligand's dissociation rate despite only marginally influencing its binding affinity, demonstrating that even receptor features with little contribution to affinity may prove critical to the dissociation process. Our results also suggest that ZM241385 follows a multistep dissociation pathway, consecutively interacting with distinct receptor regions, a mechanism that may also be common to many other GPCRs.

All target compounds were confirmed by H-1 NMR, MS spectra and elemental analysis. In addition, the 14 compounds were examined for their inhibition of [H-3]EBOB [4'-ethynyl-4-n-propylbicycloorthobenzoate] binding to housefly and rat GABA receptors and the results show that some of these compounds have inhibiting activity and selectivity between the rat and housefly GABA receptors at 10(-5) mol/L.

Salvage Radiopeptide Therapy of Advanced Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Lutetium-177-Labeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen: Efficacy and Safety in Routine Practice	CANCER BIOTHERAPY AND RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						bone marrow; bone metastases; lutetium; metastasis; prostate cancer; response to treatment	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; PRACTICE GUIDELINE; CLINICAL-ONCOLOGY; AMERICAN-SOCIETY; WORKING GROUP; PSMA LIGANDS; PHASE-II; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; PET/CT	Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based radiopeptide/radioligand therapy represents a rapidly expanding field in the management of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, there remains concern for the development of significant toxicities in heavily pretreated patients. In this study, the authors present their local experience, with respect to efficacy and toxicity, of 22 consecutive patients treated with lutetium-177-DOTAGA-(I-y)fk(Sub-KuE) or Lu-177-PSMA I&T radioimmunotherapy for progressive mCRPC, followed up over 1 year. Materials and Methods: All patients had progressive mCRPC, an European Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 2 with adequate bone marrow and liver function. Lu-177-PSMA I&T therapy was administered at 8-week intervals with a mean prescribed activity of 5.5 GBq (gigabecquerel) per patient. Results: Twenty patients had evaluable results, median age of 71 years, and median duration of follow-up of 17 months. Three patients (15%) experienced a G1/2 myelotoxicity and four (20%) G3/4. No incidences of myelodysplasia/acute leukemia have been identified. All toxicities were self-limiting. Baseline cytopenia was predictive of the development of subsequent G3/4 myelotoxicity (p=0.0035). Eight patients (40%) experienced an objective PSA response, with a median time to response of 15 weeks. The median time to PSA progression was not reached. Patients receiving three cycles of therapy were statistically more likely to experience a disease response when compared to those treated with one, two, or four cycles (p<0.0001). Conclusions: Lu-177-PSMA I&T radioimmunotherapy of progressive mCRPC is safe and effective with three cycles being the potential optimal number for determining long-term disease response.

The aim of the current study was to quantify the distribution of radioactivity in three rhesus monkeys after the injection of approximately 185 MBq (5 mCi) of F-18-FECNT. Method Whole-body images were acquired at 23-30 time points for a total of 220 min following injection of the radioligand. Source organs were identified at each time point from planar images. Results The peak activities in planar images in the six identified source organs (expressed as per cent injected dose (%ID)) were lungs (16.5%ID at 2 min), kidneys (12.5%ID at 3 min), brain (9.5%ID at 6 min), liver (7.5%ID at 3 min), red bone marrow (3.5%ID at 12 min), and urinary bladder (2%ID at 98 min). Radiation absorbed doses were calculated using the gastrointestinal tract model in two ways: (1) assuming no urine voiding, and (2) using a dynamic bladder model with voiding intervals of 2.4 and 4.8 h. Using the gastrointestinal tract model and dynamic bladder model with a voiding interval 4.8 h, the three organs with highest exposure (in muGy(.)MBq(-1) (mrad(.)mCi(-1))) were kidneys 75.68 (280), lungs 44.86 (166) and urinary bladder 58.38 (216). Effective doses estimated with and without urine voiding were in the range 21.35-22.70 muGy(.)MBq(-1) (79-84 mrad(.)mCi(-1)). Conclusion The estimated radiation burden of F-18-FECNT is relatively modest and would allow multiple scans per research subject per year. (C) 2004 Lippincott Williams Wilkins.

We used radioligand binding assays to examine whether EC produces plasticity in striatal receptor density and receptor density ratios. After 30 days of EC, 2-year-old rats had a higher ratio of D1 to muscarinic receptors in striatum relative to singly housed rats. Assays also showed trends for a greater ratio of D1 to cannabinoid receptors and a greater density of D1 receptors in striatum after EC. D2 receptor density was unaffected by the EC condition.

In order to study the distribution of group IImGluRs in the brain and to establish a radioligand binding assay we have developed a synthesis of [H-3]-DCG-IV (2a). The key intermediate, alpha-bromo aldehyde 7, was prepared in four steps starting from (-)-Feist's acid (3). The incorporation of tritium was performed by reaction of 7 with tri-n-butyltin tritide to give 8, which was transformed in two steps into 2a.

Methods The patients who were given three or four cycles of 177Lu-PSMA RLT between January 2016 and June 2018 were evaluated retrospectively. Volumetric data; PSMA tumor volume (TV) and total lesion (TL) PSMA, were obtained from 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT for whole (PSMA-TVT and TL-PSMA(T)). The distance between the two furthest lesions (D-max) was calculated. Posttreatment early prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values on the fourteenth day after treatment were obtained. According to the PSA responses, the patients were divided into two groups as progressed and nonprogressed. In univariate analysis, the relationship of PET quantitative data with biochemical response groups was evaluated with Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression was used in multivariate analysis. Results A total of 38 patients were included in the study. In univariate analysis, D-max, PSMA-TVT and TL-PSMA(T) values were obtained at lower levels in the progressed group. In multivariate analysis, only D-max was found to be a prognostic factor in predicting early biochemical response. Conclusion D-max is the most prognostic parameter in predicting the early biochemical response in patients with mCRPC; high total tumor volume and burden are also parameters that give us an idea about the response to treatment. The success rate will be higher if 177Lu-PSMA RLT treatment is planned for patients with higher tumor volume and spread.

Bioorthogonal Masking of Circulating Antibody-TCO Groups Using Tetrazine-Functionalized Dextran Polymers	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ALDER CLICK CHEMISTRY; IN-VIVO CHEMISTRY; BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY; PRETARGETED RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; PET; AFFINITY; BINDING; MICE; PHARMACOKINETICS; OPTIMIZATION	Pretargeting strategies have gained popularity for the in vivo imaging and therapy of cancer by combining antibodies with small molecule radioligands. In vivo recombination of both moieties can be achieved using the bioorthogonal inverse electron demand Diels-Alder (IEDDA) chemistry between tetrazine (Tz) and trans-cyclooctene (TCO). An issue that arises with pretargeting strategies is that while part of the antibody dose accumulates at antigen-expressing tumor tissue, there is a significant portion of the injected antibody that remains in circulation, causing a reduction in target-to-background ratios. Herein, we report the development of a novel TCO scavenger, the masking agent DP-Tz. DP-Tz is based on Tz-modified dextran polymers (DP, MW = 0.5-2 MDa). Large dextran polymers were reported to exhibit low penetration of tumor vasculature and appeared nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and easily modifiable. Our newly developed masking agent deactivates the remaining TCO-moieties on the circulating mAbs yet does not impact the tumor uptake of the Tz-radioligand. In pretargeting studies utilizing a Ga-68-labeled tetrazine radioligand ( [Ga-68] Ga-NOTA-PEG(II)-tetrazine), DP Tz constructs (Tz/DP ratios of 62-254) significantly increased TTB ratios from 0.8 +/- 0.3 (control cohorts) to up to 5.8 +/- 2.3 at 2 h postinjection. Tumor tissue delineation in PET imaging experiments employing DP Tz is significantly increased compared to control. Uptake values of other significant organs, such as heart, lungs, pancreas, and stomach, were decreased on average by 2-fold when using DP-Tz. Overall, pretargeting experiments utilizing DP-Tz showed significantly improved tumor delineation, enhanced PET image quality, and reduced uptake in vital organs. We believe that this new masking agent is a powerful new addition to the IEDDA-based pretargeting tool box and, due to its properties, an excellent candidate for clinical translation.

Changes in Binding of [<SUP>123</SUP>I]CLINDE, a High-Affinity Translocator Protein 18 kDa (TSPO) Selective Radioligand in a Rat Model of Traumatic Brain Injury	NEUROMOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Traumatic brain injury; Translocator protein 18 kDa; TSPO; Microglia; Neuroinflammation	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IN-VIVO; FOCAL ISCHEMIA; INFLAMMATION; PET; NEUROINFLAMMATION; SITES	After traumatic brain injury (TBI), secondary injuries develop, including neuroinflammatory processes that contribute to long-lasting impairments. These secondary injuries represent potential targets for treatment and diagnostics. The translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is expressed in activated microglia cells and upregulated in response to brain injury and therefore a potential biomarker of the neuroinflammatory processes. Second-generation radioligands of TSPO, such as [I-123]CLINDE, have a higher signal-to-noise ratio as the prototype ligand PK11195. [I-123]CLINDE has been employed in human studies using single-photon emission computed tomography to image the neuroinflammatory response after stroke. In this study, we used the same tracer in a rat model of TBI to determine changes in TSPO expression. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to moderate controlled cortical impact injury and sacrificed at 6, 24, 72 h and 28 days post surgery. TSPO expression was assessed in brain sections employing [I-123]CLINDE in vitro autoradiography. From 24 h to 28 days post surgery, injured animals exhibited a marked and time-dependent increase in [I-123]CLINDE binding in the ipsilateral motor, somatosensory and parietal cortex, as well as in the hippocampus and thalamus. Interestingly, binding was also significantly elevated in the contralateral M1 motor cortex following TBI. Craniotomy without TBI caused a less marked increase in [I-123]CLINDE binding, restricted to the ipsilateral hemisphere. Radioligand binding was consistent with an increase in TSPO mRNA expression and CD11b immunoreactivity at the contusion site. This study demonstrates the applicability of [I-123]CLINDE for detailed regional and quantitative assessment of glial activity in experimental models of TBI.

These studies were performed with ligands, such as ketanserin, altanserin and LSD, that may bind with high-affinity to different structural or functional conformations of the 5-HT2AR. Interpretation of results may also be confounded by chronic antipsychotic treatment and suicidal behavior in the schizophrenia group. We quantified 5-HT2AR density by radioligand binding assays in postmortem prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free (n=29) and antipsychotic-treated (n=16) schizophrenics, suicide victims with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=13), and individually matched controls. [H-3]Ketanserin binding, and its displacement by altanserin or the LSD-like agonist DO!, was assayed. Results indicate that the number of [(CH)-C-3]ketanserin binding sites to the 5-HT2AR was increased in antipsychotic-free (128 +/- 11%), but not in antipsychotic-treated (92 +/- 12%), schizophrenic subjects. In suicide victims, [H-3]ketanserin binding did not differ as compared to controls. Aging correlated negatively with [H-3]ketanserin binding in schizophrenia, suicide victims and controls. The fraction of high-affinity sites of DOI displacing [H-3]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT2AR was increased in antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects. Functional uncoupling of heterotrimeric G proteins led to increased fraction of high-affinity sites of altanserin displacing [H-3]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT2AR in schizophrenic subjects, but not in controls. Together, these results suggest that the active conformation of the 5-HT2AR is up-regulated in prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects, and may provide a pharmacological explanation for discordant findings previously obtained.

Studies of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 radioligand [11C]ABP688 with N-acetylcysteine challenge in rhesus monkeys	SYNAPSE			English	Article						PET; mGluR5 radioligand; NAC; allosteric modulator; test-retest; nonhuman primate	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO; ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; CNS DISORDERS; FRAGILE-X; PET; BINDING; MGLUR5; PHARMACOLOGY; LIGAND	Detecting changes in receptor binding at the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) with the PET allosteric antagonist, [11C]ABP688, may be valuable for studying dysfunctional glutamate transmission associated with psychiatric illnesses. This study was designed to validate the findings of a recent pilot study in baboons which reported a significant global decrease from baseline [11C]ABP688 binding after increasing endogenous glutamate with 50 mg/kg N-acetylcysteine (NAC), with no change from test to retest. In rhesus monkeys (n=5), paired [11C]ABP688 scans were performed on the same day on the Focus-220 as follows (n=3 per group): test-retest, baseline-NAC (50 mg/kg), and baseline-NAC (100 mg/kg). Multiple modeling methods were evaluated for kinetic analysis to estimate the total volume of distribution (VT) and non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) in regions-of-interest (ROIs), with the cerebellum gray matter (CGM) as the reference region. There was an increasing trend from test to retest BPND across ROIs (13%). NAC (50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg) increased VT (5% and 19%) and decreased BPND (3% and 10%), respectively, significant only for VT in ROIs at the 100 mg/kg dose. High intersubject variability in BPND was comparable to that reported in the baboon study. However, interpretability of BPND is difficult with increases in VT in the CGM reference region at the higher NAC dose. Additionally, the net reduction in BPND from the baseline-NAC scans may be obscured due to observed increases in test-retest BPND. Thus, we did not strictly replicate the findings in the baboon study based on BPND. Synapse 67:489-501, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

By the help of the combinatorial chemistry a series of hexapeptides with a general formula of Ac-RYY-R/K-W/I-R/K-NH2 having high NOP receptor affinity and selectivity were identified. On the basis of this information we developed a number of novel compounds. The detailed structure-activity studies on the partial agonist Ac-RYYRIK-NH2 are reported in this communication. Besides the modifications on N- and C-terminal, Arg-Cit exchange was performed on the template structure. The novel hexapepticles were analyzed in radioligand binding, functional biochemical [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays by using membranes from rat brains and Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing human NOP receptor. The agonist/antagonist properties were also tested on in the mouse vas deferens bioassay. C-terminal modification yielded a high affinity, selective and potent NOP ligand (Ac-RYYRIK-ol) with a partial agonist property. Several analogs of this compound were synthesized. The presence of the positively charged arginine residue at the first position turned out to be crucial for the biological activity of the hexapeptide. The N-terminal modifications with various acyl groups (ClAc, pivaloyl, formyl, benzoyl, mesyl) decreased the affinity of the ligand towards the receptor and the intrinsic activity for stimulating the G-protein activation was also decreased. The structure-activity studies on the hexapeptide derivatives provided some basic information on the structural requirements for receptor binding and activation. Copyright (c) 2006 S.

Positron emission tomography (PET), with appropriate radioligands, offers the possibility to assess beta-AR density non-invasively in humans. However, no PET radioligand for the selective imaging of cardiac beta(1)-ARs is clinically available. Here some derivatives of the well characterized beta(1)-AR selective antagonist, ICI 89,406, namely the enantiomers of N-[2-[3-(2-cyano-phenoxy)-2-hydroxy-propylamino]-ethyl]-N'-(4-hydroxy-phenyl)-urea (5a and 5b) were synthesized and evaluated in vitro. The (R)-isomer 5a was more beta(1)-selective but has lower affinity than its (S)-enantiomer 5b (beta(1)-AR selectivity: 6100 vs 1240; beta(1)-affinity: K-1 = 0.288 nM vs K-1 = 0.067 nM). Etherification of the analogous desmethyl precursors, 5e and 5f, respectively, with [C-11]iodomethane gave C-11-labelled versions of 5a and 5b, namely 5g and 5h, in 44 +/- 5% radiochemical yield (decay-corrected) and 97.4 +/- 1.3 % radiochemical purity with specific radioactivities of 26.4 +/- 9.4 GBq/mu mol within 41.2 +/- 3.4 min from the end of bombardment (n = 14). 5g and 5h are now being evaluated as candidate radioligands for myocardial beta(1)-ARs.

The in vivo binding of some dopamine (DA) radioligands such as C-11-raclopride is affected by fluctuations in endogenous DA, thus providing an indirect measure of DA presynaptic activity. Attempts to identify a serotonergic radiotracer with similar properties have proved unsuccessful. Here, we investigated in humans the effects of reduced synaptic 5-HT on the in vivo binding of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) radioligand C-11-DASB, using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and the rapid tryptophan depletion (RTD) technique. Eight (8) subjects (5M, 3F) were scanned with C-11-DASB under control and reduced endogenous 5-HT conditions, in a within-subject, double-blind, counterbalanced, crossover design. Regional distribution volumes (V-T) were calculated using kinetic modeling and metabolite-corrected arterial input function. C-11-DASB specific binding was estimated as binding potential (BP) and specific to nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficient (V-3"), using the cerebellum as reference region. RTD caused small but significant mean reductions in C-11-DASB V-T (-6.1%) and BP (-4.5%) across brain regions, probably explained by a concomitant reduction in C-11-DASB plasma free fraction (f(1)) of similar magnitude. No significant change in C-11-DASB V-3" was observed between control and reduced 5-HT conditions. Nor was there a significant relationship between the magnitude of tryptophan depletion and change in BP and V-3" across individual subjects. These results suggest that C-11-DASB in vivo binding is not affected by reductions in endogenous 5-HT. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, the role of mGluR5 in post-operative pain remains to be fully investigated. The present study was conducted to characterize analgesic activity of 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) in the skin-incision-induced post-operative pain model in rats. MPEP is a potent and selective mGluR5 antagonist with high affinity (K-i = 6.3 +/- 0.9 nM) in rat cortex using [H-3]-MPEP as a radioligand, while not competing with the mGluR1-selective radioligand [H-3]-R214127 (K-i > 10,000 nM) in rat cerebellum. Post-operative pain was examined 2 h following surgery using weight-bearing (WB) difference between injured and uninjured paws as a measure of nonevoked pain. In this model, MPEP, as morphine, showed dose-dependent effects and full efficacy after systemic administration (ED50 = 15 mg/kg, i.p. for MPEP, ED50 = 1.3 mg/kg, s.c. for morphine). In addition, intrathecal (i.t.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) MPEP reduced WB difference (ED50 = 65 mu g/rat i.t. and ED50 = 200 mu g/rat i.c.v.). Interestingly, intraplantar (i.pl.) injection of MPEP either before or after surgery induced a similar reduction in WB difference (ED50 = 90 mu g/rat, i.pl.) while contralateral i.pl. MPEP injection did not produce any effect. These results demonstrate that both peripheral and central mGluR5 receptors play a role in nociceptive transmission observed during post-operative pain. In addition, the data suggest that mGluR5 antagonists could offer a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of post-operative pain.

In this study, we determined whether this effect was associated with changes in alpha(1D)-AR subcellular localization. Confocal imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged receptors and sucrose density gradient fractionation suggested that full-length alpha(1D)-ARs were found primarily in intracellular compartments, whereas Delta(1-79)alpha(1D)-ARs were translocated to the plasma membrane. This resulted in a 3- to 4-fold increase in intrinsic activity for stimulation of inositol phosphate formation by norepinephrine. We determined whether this effect was transplantable by creating N-terminal chimeras of alpha(1)-ARs containing the body of one subtype and the N terminus of another (alpha(1A) NT-D, alpha(1B) NT-D, alpha(1D) NT-A, and alpha(1D)NT-B). When expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, radioligand binding revealed that binding densities of alpha(1A)- or alpha(1B)-ARs containing the alpha(1D)-N terminus decreased by 86 to 93%, whereas substitution of alpha(1A)- or alpha(1B)-N termini increased alpha(1D)-AR binding site density by 2- to 3-fold. Confocal microscopy showed that GFP-tagged alpha(1D)NT-B-ARs were found only on the cell surface, whereas GFP-tagged alpha(1B)NT-D-ARs were completely intracellular. Radioligand binding and confocal imaging of GFP-tagged alpha(1D)- and Delta(1-79)alpha(1D)-ARs expressed in rat aortic smooth muscle cells produced similar results, suggesting these effects are generalizable to cell types that endogenously express alpha(1D)-ARs. These findings demonstrate that the N-terminal region of alpha(1D)-ARs contain a transplantable signal that is critical for regulating formation of functional bindings, through regulating cellular localization.

This was further substantiated by the pharmacological profile of the binding. Hence, the binding of H-3-MADAM was potently inhibited by SSRIs but not by selective inhibitors of noradrenaline transport and dopamine transport. Likewise, a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist did not inhibit H-3-MADAM binding. 4 H-3-MADAM binding in vivo was inhibited only by compounds which also inhibited the binding of H-3-MADAM in vitro (the SSRIs, mixed SERT/noradrenaline transport inhibitors and clomipramine), confirming the selectivity of H-3-MADAM for SERT also in vivo. Moreover, compounds effective in inhibiting H-3-MADAM binding were the only ones found to be active in the mouse 5-HTP potentiation test confirming the model as a behavioural correlate to in vivo 5-HT uptake. 5 Finally, it was found that a SERT occupancy of 85-95% was necessary to produce 50% of the maximum behavioural response (ED50).

Here we show that stimulation of rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast-like cells with the A(3) AR agonists N-6-(3-iodo) benzyl-5'-N-methylcarboxamidodoadenosine (IB-MECA; 10 nM) or inosine (10 muM) stimulates phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt). IB-MECA (1 muM) also causes a >50% reduction in apoptosis caused by exposure of RBL-2H3 cells to UV light. Akt phosphorylation is not stimulated by 100 nM N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (A(1)-selective) or CGS21680 (A(2A)-selective) and is absent in cells pretreated with wortmannin or pertussis toxin. The K-I values of the AR antagonists BW-1433 and 8-sulfophenyltheophylline (8-SPT) were determined in radioligand binding assays for all four subtypes of rat ARs: BW-1433 (A(1), 5.8 +/- 1.0 nM; A(2A), 240 +/- 37; A(2B),30 +/- 10; A(3), 12,300 +/- 3,700); 8-SPT (A(1), 3.2 +/- 1.2 muM; A(2A),57 +/- 4; A(2B), 2.2 +/- 0.8; A(3), >100). BW-1433 and the A(3)-slective antagonist MRS1523 (5 muM), but not 8-SPT (100 muM), block IB-MECA-induced protection from apoptosis, confirming the A(3) AR as the mediator of the antiapoptotic response. The data suggest that adenosine and inosine activate Gi-coupled A(3) ARs to protect mast cells from apoptosis by a pathway involving the beta gamma subunits of Gi, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase beta, and Akt. We speculate that activation of A(3) ARs on mast cells or other cells that express A(3) ARs (e.g., eosinophils) may facilitate their survival and accumulation in inflamed tissues.

However, response to Lu-PSMA therapy is only achieved in approximately half of patients. It is clinically important to identify patients at risk of poor outcome. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate pretherapeutic PSMA PET derived total tumor volume and related metrics as prognosticators of overall survival in patients receiving Lu-PSMA therapy. Methods A total number of 110 patients form the Departments of Nuclear Medicine Munster and Essen were included in this retrospective analysis. Baseline PSMA PET-CT was available for all patients. Employing a previously published approach, all tumor lesions were semi-automatically delineated in PSMA PET-CT acquisitions. Total lesion number, total tumor volume (PSMA-TV), total lesion uptake (PSMA-TLU = PSMA-TV *SUVmean), and total lesion quotient (PSMA-TLQ = PSMA-TV /SUV(mean))were quantified for each patient. Log2 transformation was used for regressions. Results Lesion number, PSMA-TV, and PSMA-TLQ were prognosticators of overall survival (HR = 1.255,p = 0.009; HR = 1.299,p = 0.005; HR = 1.326,p = 0.002). In a stepwise backward Cox regression including lesion number, PSMA-TV, PSA, LDH, and PSMA-TLQ, only the latter two remained independent and statistically significant negative prognosticators of overall survival (HR = 1.632,p = 0.011; HR = 1.239,p = 0.024). PSMA-TLQ and LDH were significant negative prognosticators in multivariate Cox regression in contrast to PSA value. Conclusion PSMA-TV was a statistically significant negative prognosticator of overall survival in patients receiving Lu-PSMA therapy. PSMA-TLQ was an independent and superior prognosticator of overall survival compared with PSMA-TV.

Methods: 109 mCRPC patients treated with a median of 3 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 were included. Data were analyzed according to OS as well as PSA response patterns with regard to prior therapies, laboratory biomarkers and metastatic extent in univariate as well as multivariate Cox's proportional hazards models. PSA decline was assessed using the lowest PSA levels after the first cycle of therapy (initial PSA response) and during the entire observation period (best PSA response). Results: In total, 54 patients (49.5%) died during the observation period. First and second line chemotherapy were performed in 85% and 26%, and Abiraterone and Enzalutamide were administered in 83% and 85%, respectively. Any initial PSA decline occurred in 55% while 25% showed a PSA decline of >= 50%. The median estimated OS was 9.9 months (95% CI: 7.2-12.5) for all patients. Any initial decline of PSA was associated with significantly prolonged OS (15.5 vs. 5.7 months, p = 0.002). Second line cabazitaxel chemotherapy (6.7 vs. 15.7 months, p = 0.002) and presence of visceral metastases (5.9 vs. 16.4 months, p< 0.001) were associated with shorter OS. Only visceral metastases remained significant in a multivariate analysis. Conclusion: Lu-177-PSMA-617 is an effective therapy for patients with mCRPC. However, the present data indicate that its beneficial effects on OS are strongly influenced by pretreatment (history of second line chemotherapy with cabazitaxel) and the presence of visceral metastases at onset of Lu-177-PSMA-617 treatment.

Due to the similarity between the transmembrane domains of the alpha(1)-AR sub-types, and the serotonin receptor subtype 1A (5-HT1A-R), currently used alpha(1)-AR subtype-selective drugs to treat BPH display considerable off-target affinity for the 5-HT1A-R, leading to side effects. We describe the construction and validation of pharmacophores for 5-HT1A-R agonists and antagonists. Through the structural diversity of the training sets used in their development, these pharmacophores define the properties of a compound needed to bind to 5-HT1A receptors. Using these and previously published pharmacophores in virtual screening and profiling, we have identified unique chemical compounds (hits) that fit the requirements to bind to our target, the alpha(1A)-AR, selectively over the off-target, the 5-HT1A-R. Selected hits have been obtained and their affinities for alpha(1A)-AR, alpha(1B)-AR and 5-HT1A-R determined in radioligand binding assays, using membrane preparations which contain human receptors expressed individually. Three of the tested hits demonstrate statistically significant selectivity for alpha(1A)-AR over 5-HT1A-R. All seven tested hits bind to alpha(1A)-AR, with two compounds displaying K-i values below 1 mu M, and a further two K-i values of around 10 mu M. The insights and knowledge gained through the development of the new 5-HT1A-R pharmacophores will greatly aid in the design and synthesis of derivatives of our lead compound, and allow the generation of more efficacious and selective ligands.

Isotopic labeling of SSR180575 with the short-lived positron-emitter carbon-11 (T-1/2: 20.38 min) at its 5-methylpyridazino[4,5-Mindole moiety as well as at its N,N-dimethylacetamide function by methylation of the corresponding nor-analogues was investigated. Best results in terms of radiochemical yields and purities were obtained for the preparation of [indole-N-methyl-C-11]SSR180575, where routine production batches of 4.5-5.0 GBq of radiochemically pure (>99%) i.v. injectable solutions (specific radioactivities: 50-90 GBq/mu mol) could be prepared within a total synthesis time of 25 min (HPLC purification included) starting from a 55 GBq [C-11]CO2 cyclotron production batch (non-decay-corrected overall radiochemical yields: 8-9%). The process comprises (1) trapping at 10 degrees C of [C-11]methyl triflate in DMF (300 mu l) containing 0.2-0.3 mg of the indole precursor for labeling and 4 mg of K2CO3 (excess); (2) heating at 120 degrees C for 3 min; (3) dilution of the residue with 0.5 ml of the HPLC mobile phase and (4) purification using semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC (Zorbax (R) 58-C-18). In vivo pharmacological properties of [indole-N-methyl-11C]SSR180575 as a candidate for imaging neuroinflammation with positron emission tomography are currently evaluated.

Methods Three healthy drug-naive female Beagle dogs were scanned before and after administration of a single-dose pipamperone of 5 and 10 mg. Acquisition was performed under general anesthesia 90 min after injection of the specific radioligand I-123-5-I-R91150 with a triple head gamma-camera (Triad, Trionix). Binding index and receptor occupancy were calculated on the emission data after image fusion with the emission data from the individual Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer perfusion scans to optimize frontal cortex delineation. Results A dose-dependent reduction of the binding index was observed after single low-dose pipamperone, suggestive for competition of this cold compound with the radioligand for the 5-HT2A receptor. The calculated mean-binding serotonin-2A binding index in the frontal cortex was 1.47 before treatment and reduced to 1.28 after one dose of pipamperone 5 mg and to 1.08 after one dose of pipamperone 10 mg. The calculated occupancy was 40.4% after one dose of 5 mg pipamperone and 83% after one dose of 10 mg pipamperone. Conclusion This experiment supports the hypothesis that pipamperone, even in the low-dose range, significantly blocks serotonin-2A receptors. This study also demonstrates the value of the canine model to investigate the effects of drugs on neurotransmitter systems. Repeated nuclear imaging brain scanning experiments with different paradigms and medication doses are possible with conventional imaging equipment in a well-accepted laboratory species.

Based on behavioral and pharmacological assessments, sigma-1 receptors are important in memory and cognitive processes, and are thought to be involved in specific psychiatric illnesses, including schizophrenia, depression, and drug addiction. It is thought that specific neuroactive steroids are endogenous ligands for these sites. In addition, several sigma-1 receptor binding steroids including progesterone, dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and testosterone are being examined clinically for specific therapeutic purposes; however, their mechanisms of action have not been clearly defined. We previously described the high affinity sigma-1 receptor selective PET tracer [F-18]FPS. This study examines the effect of neuroactive steroids on [F-18]FPS binding in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition constants were determined in vitro for progesterone, testosterone, DHEA, estradiol, and estriol binding to the [F-18]FPS labeled receptor. The affinity order (K-i values) for these steroids ranged from 36 nM for progesterone to > 10,000 nM for estrodiol and estriol. Biodistribution studies revealed that i.v. coadministration of progesterone (10 mg/kg), testosterone (20 mg/kg), or DHEA (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased [F-18]FPS uptake (%ID/g) by up to 50% in nearly all of eight brain regions examined. [F-18]FPS uptake in several peripheral organs that express sigma-1 receptors (heart, spleen, muscle, lung) was also reduced (54-85%). These studies clearly demonstrate that exogenously administered steroids can occupy sigma-1 receptors in vivo, and that [F-18]FPS may provide an effective tool for monitoring sigma-1 receptor occupancy of specific therapeutic steroids during clinical trials.

Acute and chronic tryptophan depletion differentially regulate central 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor binding in the rat	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						tryptophan depletion; serotonin (5-HT); 5-HT1A receptor; 5-HT2A receptor; rats; radioligand binding	RAPID DEPLETION; 5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID; ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTION; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; PLASMA TRYPTOPHAN; BRAIN; DIET; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISM; RESPONSES	Rationale Tryptophan depletion is used to reduce central serotonergic function and to investigate its role in psychiatric illness. Despite widespread clinical use, its effects on serotonin (5-HT) receptors have not been well characterized. Objective The aim of this study was to examine the effect of acute (ATD) and chronic tryptophan depletion (CTD) on free-plasma tryptophan (TRP), central TRP and 5-HT and brain 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptor binding in the rat. Methods TRP and 5-HT were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography and receptor levels determined by homogenate radioligand binding and in-vitro receptor autoradiography. Results Free-plasma TRP, central TRP and central 5-HT levels were significantly and similarly reduced by ATD and 1- and 3-week CTD compared to controls. ATD significantly reduced 5-HT1A binding in the dorsal raphe (14%) but did not significantly alter postsynaptic 5-HT1A binding (frontal cortex, remaining cortex and hippocampus) or 5-HT2A binding (cortex and striatum). One-week CTD did not significantly alter cortical 5-HT2A binding or postsynaptic 5-HT1A binding. Furthermore, 3-week CTD did not significantly alter 5-HT1A binding but significantly increased cortical 5-HT2A binding without affecting striatal or hippocampal levels. In the CTD 1 and 3-week groups, rat body weight was significantly decreased as compared to controls. However, weight loss was not a confounding factor for decreased cortical 5-HT2A-receptor binding. Conclusion ATD-induced reduction in somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptor binding may represent an intrinsic 'homeostatic response' reducing serotonergic feedback in dorsal raphe projection areas. In contrast, the increase in 5-HT2A receptor after CTD may be a compensatory response to a long-term reduction in 5-HT.

Fluorescent ligands also offer the advantage of allowing real time direct visualisation of ligand-receptors interactions. A fluorescent analogue of CGP 12177 (BODIPY-TMR-CGP) has thus been evaluated as a beta(2)-adrenoceptor ligand in CHO-K1 cells expressing the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor. 2 Studies of H-3-cAMP accumulation showed that BODIPY-TMR-CGP stimulated an increase in cAMP accumulation and cyclic AMP response element (CRE)-mediated gene transcription with an EC50 of 21-28 nM. Both of these responses were antagonised by the selective beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118551. 3 Binding studies with H-3-CGP12177, and functional studies of CRE-regulated gene transcription showed that the BODIPY-TMR-CGP interaction with the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor is of very long duration. 4 Visualisation of the binding of BODIPY-TMR-CGP to single living mammalian cells was clearly demonstrated by confocal microscopy and showed that this ligand was able to selectively label cell surface beta(2)-adrenoceptors in living CHO-K1 cells transfected with the human beta(2)-adrenoceptor with an apparent K-D of 27 nM. Studies with cells expressing a beta(2)-adrenoceptor-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein provided further strong evidence that BODIPY-TMR-CGP was binding to the beta(2)-adrenoceptor. 5 BODIPY-TMR-CGP is therefore a long-acting fluorescent beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist that can be used to label beta(2)-adrenoceptors in the plasma membrane of living cells.

Recombinant goldfish prolactin was expressed mainly as insoluble inclusion bodies in the form of N-terminal 6 x His-tagged fusion protein. This fusion protein was purified, refolded, and I-125-labeled to generate a radioligand for receptor binding and validation of a radioimmunoassay for goldfish prolactin. Using goldfish gill membrane as the substrate for prolactin receptor binding, both recombinant and native forms of goldfish prolactin were effective in displacing the specific binding of the radioligand in a similar dose range, suggesting that the fusion protein was refolded properly and could be recognized by goldfish prolactin receptors. To quantify prolactin contents in biological samples from the goldfish, a radioimmunoassay using the I-125-labeled recombinant prolactin as a tracer was established. This assay was shown to be selective for goldfish prolactin without cross-reactivity with mammalian prolactin and pituitary hormones from other fish species (e.g., growth hormone and gonadotropin II). This newly validated assay system was used to investigate neuroendocrine and signal transduction mechanisms regulating prolactin release in the goldfish. In this case, the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and protein kinase C activator TPA were effective in elevating basal levels of prolactin secretion in perifused goldfish pituitary cells. In parallel studies using a static incubation approach, somatostatin and dopamine, but not vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were inhibitory to basal prolactin release in goldfish pituitary cells. These results suggest that somatostatin and dopamine may serve as negative regulators of basal prolactin secretion and that extracellular Ca2+ influx and protein kinase C activation may be important signaling events mediating prolactin release in the goldfish.

Despite the growing importance of the VDR system as a modulator of cell growth and differentiation, convenient assays for quantitative measurement of VDR are not readily available, and [H-3]1,25(OH)(2)D-3 ligand binding assays remain the standard method. In this paper, we present data to validate and characterize the usefulness of a new VDR enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) kit developed for the measurement of VDR in biological samples, In this assay, samples are added to microtitration wells coated with anti-VDR antibody and incubated with a second anti-VDR antibody that is biotinylated, The antibody receptor complex is then detected with streptavidin-labeled horseradish peroxidase followed by incubation with a chromogenic substrate, tetramethylbenzidine. The assay was found to be sensitive and accurate for measurements of VDR and compared favorably with the conventional radioligand binding assay (RBA). The interassay variation ranged from 5% to 25% and the intraassay variation was less than 5%. The ELISA presents several advantages over existing methodology, including the use of nonradioactive detection systems, lower protein and sample volume requirements, as well as convenience and speed, The assay can be completed in as short a time as 3 h, avoiding overnight incubations, Data are also presented to demonstrate the ability of the ELISA to detect both occupied and unoccupied VDR, making it a valuable research tool in settings where 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 is present. However, the ELISA, as currently formulated, is only useful for the detection of human VDR. (Rone 28:319-326; 2001) (C) 2001 by Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Intra-therapeutic dosimetry of [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in low-volume hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer patients and correlation with treatment outcome	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA; Dosimetry; Radionuclide therapy; Prostate cancer; mHSPC	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; NORMAL ORGANS; PSMA; GUIDELINES; EVOLUTION; TUMOR	Introduction While [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA radioligand therapy is currently only applied in end-stage metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients, also low-volume hormone-sensitive metastatic prostate cancer (mHSPC) patients can benefit from it. However, there are toxicity concerns related to the sink effect in low-volume disease. This prospective study aims to determine the kinetics of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA in mHSPC patients, analyzing the doses to organs at risk (salivary glands, kidneys, liver, and bone marrow) and tumor lesions < 1 cm diameter. Methods Ten mHSPC patients underwent two cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy. Three-bed position SPECT/CT was performed at 5 time points after each therapy. Organ dosimetry and lesion dosimetry were performed using commercial software and a manual approach, respectively. Correlation between absorbed index lesion dose and treatment response (PSA drop of > 50% at the end of the study) was calculated and given as Spearman's r and p-values. Results Kinetics of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA in mHSPC patients are comparable to those in mCRPC patients. Lesion absorbed dose was high (3.25 +/- 3.19 Gy/GBq) compared to organ absorbed dose (salivary glands: 0.39 +/- 0.17 Gy/GBq, kidneys: 0.49 +/- 0.11 Gy/GBq, liver: 0.09 +/- 0.01 Gy/GBq, bone marrow: 0.017 +/- 0.008 Gy/GBq). A statistically significant correlation was found between treatment response and absorbed index lesion dose (p = 0.047). Conclusions We successfully performed small lesion dosimetry and showed that the tumor sink effect in mHSPC patients is of less concern than was expected. Tumor-to-organ ratio of absorbed dose was high and tumor uptake correlates with PSA response. Additional treatment cycles are legitimate in terms of organ toxicity and could lead to better tumor response.	[Peters, Steffie M.

To test usefulness in humans, we determined blood-brain clearances, volumes of distribution, and receptor availability by means of PET with C-11-yohimbine in healthy male adults. Methods: We recorded the distribution of C-11-yohimbine with 90-min dynamic PET and sampled arterial blood to measure intact C-11-yohimbine in plasma. For analysis, we coregistered PET images to individual MR images and automatically identified 27 volumes of interest. We used 1-tissue-compartment graphical analysis with 6 linearized solutions of the fundamental binding equation, with the metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curves as input function, to estimate the kinetic parameters of C-11-yohimbine. With the lowest steady-state distribution volume (V-T), determined in the corpus callosum, we calculated the binding potential (receptor availability) of the radioligand in other regions. Results: The linear regressions yielded similar estimates of the kinetic parameters. The cortical values of V-T ranged from 0.82 mL cm(-3) in the right frontal cortex to 0.46 mL cm-3 in the corpus callosum, with intermediate V-T values in subcortical structures. Binding potentials averaged 0.6-0.8 in the cortex and 0.2-0.5 in subcortical regions. Conclusion: The maps of C-11-yohimbine binding to alpha 2 adrenoceptors in human brain had the highest values in cortical areas and hippocampus, with moderate values in subcortical structures, as found also in vitro. The results confirm the usefulness of the tracer C-11-yohimbine for mapping alpha 2 adrenoceptors in human brain in vivo.

Relaxin-3 mRNA levels in <i>nucleus incertus</i> correlate with alcohol and sucrose intake in rats	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Relaxin-3; RXFP3; Nucleus incertus; Neuropeptides; Alcohol; mRNA	SITU HYBRIDIZATION HISTOCHEMISTRY; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; IN-VITRO; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; NEURONS; STRESS; ADDICTION; SEEKING	Background: Chronic alcohol intake produces multiple neuroadaptive changes, including up- and down-regulation of neuropeptides and receptors. There are widespread projections of relaxin-3 containing neurons to, and abundant relaxin family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3) expression within, brain regions involved in modulating alcohol intake. Recently we demonstrated the involvement of relaxin-3/RXFP3 signalling in alcohol-seeking in rats; therefore in this study we examined whether relaxin-3 and/or RXFP3 expression were altered by chronic alcohol intake in alcohol-preferring iP rats. Methods: Expression of relaxin-3 mRNA in the hindbrain nucleus incertus and RXFP3 radioligand binding levels in discrete forebrain regions were investigated following voluntary intake of alcohol or sucrose for 12 weeks, with a 2 day washout, using quantitative in situ hybridisation histochemisty and in vitro receptor autoradiography, respectively, in cohorts of adult, male iP rats. Results: Levels of relaxin-3 mRNA in the hindbrain nucleus incertus were positively correlated with the level of intake of both alcohol (r(12)= 0.59,p = 0.03) and sucrose (r(7)= 0.70,p = 0.04) in iP rats. Dense binding of the RXFP3-selective radioligand, [(125)]-R3/15, was detected in hypothalamic and extrahypothalamic sites, but no significant changes in the density of RXFP3 were observed in the brain regions quantified following chronic sucrose or ethanol intake. Conclusions: Our findings suggest high endogenous relaxin-3 expression may be associated with higher intake of rewarding substances, rather than its expression being regulated in response to their intake, consistent with an active role for the relaxin-3/RXFP3 system in modulating ingestive and alcohol-related behaviours.

Herein, we show that the tetrahydroisoquinoline 1H-indole-2-carboxylic acid {4-[2-(cyano-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)ethyl]-cyclohexyl}-amide (SB269,652) behaves as an atypical, allosteric antagonist at D-3 and D-2 receptors. Accordingly, SB269,652 potently (low nanomolar range) abolished specific binding of [H-3] nemanopride and [H-3] spiperone to Chinese hamster ovary-transfected D-3 receptors when radioligands were used at 0.2 and 0.5 nM, respectively. However, even at high concentrations (5 mu M), SB269,652 only submaximally inhibited the specific binding of these radioligands when they were employed at 10-fold higher concentrations. By analogy, although SB269,652 potently blocked D-3 receptor-mediated activation of G alpha(i3) and phosphorylation of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, when concentrations of dopamine were increased by 10-fold, from 1 mu M to 10 mu M, SB269,652 only submaximally inhibited dopamine-induced stimulation of G alpha(i3). SB269,652 (up to 10 mu M) only weakly and partially (by approximately 20-30%) inhibited radioligand binding to D-2 receptors. Likewise, SB269,652 only submaximally suppressed D-2 receptor-mediated stimulation of G alpha(i3) and G alpha(qi5) (detected with the aequorin assay) and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Akt. Furthermore, SB269,652 only partially (35%) inhibited the dopamine-induced recruitment of beta-arrestin2 to D-2 receptors. Finally, Schild analysis using G alpha(i3) assays, and studies of radioligand association and dissociation kinetics, supported allosteric actions of SB269,652 at D-3 and D-2 receptors.

Development of a PET radioligand selective for cerebral amyloid angiopathy	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid; Amyloid-beta; Cerebrovascular; Immunotherapy; Positron emission tomography		Introduction: Positron emission tomography (PET) using radiolabeled amyloid-binding compounds has advanced the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by enabling detection and longitudinal tracking of fibrillar amyloid-beta (A beta) deposits in living people. However, this technique cannot distinguish between A beta deposits in brain parenchyma (amyloid plaques) from those in blood vessels (cerebral amyloid angiopathy, CM). Development of a PET radioligand capable of selectively detecting CAA would help clarify its contribution to global brain amyloidosis and clinical symptoms in AD and would help to characterize side-effects of anti-A beta immunotherapies in AD patients, such as CAA. Methods: A candidate CAA-selective compound (1) from a panel of analogues of the amyloid-binding dye Congo red was synthesized. The binding affinity to A beta fibrils and lipophilicity of compound 1 were determined and selectivity for CAA versus parenchymal plaque deposits was assessed ex-vivo and in-vivo in transgenic APP/PS1 mice and in postmortem human brain affected with AD pathology. Results: Compound 1 displays characteristics of Ali binding dyes, such as thioflavin-S, in that it labels both parenchymal Ali plaques and CAA when applied to histological sections from both a transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of Ali amyloidosis and AD brain. Thus, compound 1 lacks molecular selectivity to distinguish A beta deposits in CAA from those in plaques. However, when administered to living APP / PS1 mice intravenously, compound 1 preferentially labels CM when assessed using in-vivo two-photon microscopy and ex-vivo histology and autoradiography. Conclusion: We hypothesize that selectivity of compound 1 for CAA is attributable to its limited penetration of the blood-brain barrier due to the highly polar nature of the carboxylate moiety, thereby limiting access to parenchymal plaques and promoting selective in-vivo labeling of A beta deposits in the vascular wall (i.e., "delivery selectivity").

Structural modifications of the xanthine core were introduced in the 8-position (benzylamino and benzyloxy substitution) as well as at N1, N3, and N7 (small alkyl residues), thereby improving affinity and selectivity for the A(2A) AR. The compounds were characterized by radioligand binding assays, and our study resulted in the development of the potent A(2A) AR ligands including 8-((6-chloro-2-fluoro-3-methox-ybenzyl)amino)-1-ethyl-3,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione (12d; K-i human A(2A)AR: 68.5 nM) and 8-((2-chlorobenzyl)amino)-1-ethyl-3,7-dimethyl-3,7-dihydro-1H-purine-2,6-dione (12h; Ki human A2AAR: 71.1 nM). Moreover, dual A(1)/A(2A)AR ligands were identified in the group of 1,3-diethyl-7-methylxanthine de-rivatives. Compound 14b displayed K-i values of 52.2 nM for the A1AR and 167 nM for the A2AAR. Selected A2AAR ligands were further evaluated as inactive for inhibition of monoamine oxidase A, B and isoforms of phosphodiesterase-4B1,-10A, which represent classical targets for xanthine derivatives. Therefore, the devel-oped 8-benzylaminoxanthine scaffold seems to be highly selective for AR activity and relevant for potent and selective A2A ligands. Compound 12d with high selectivity for ARs, especially for the A2AAR subtype, evaluated in animal models of inflammation has shown anti-inflammatory activity. Investigated compounds were found to display high selectivity and may therefore be of high interest for further development as drugs for treating cancer or neurodegenerative diseases.

Trace elements and biotoxins may modify physiological functions in exposed organisms, and studies have been conducted to better understand their respective kinetics and effects in marine species. Despite the increasing concern of concurrent toxic HABs and pollution events due to anthropogenic pressures and global change, very little information is available on their combined effects. Chemical interactions between biotoxins and trace elements have been reported, and exposure to certain biotoxins is known to modify ion transport pathways, suggesting that biotoxins have the potential to alter trace element uptake. Using specific and sensitive radiotracer techniques (radioligand receptor binding assay and gamma-spectrometry), this laboratory study examined the influence of pre-exposure to the brevetoxins (PbTxs)-producing microalgae Karenia brevis on the bioaccumutation of selected non-essential (Cd) and essential (Co, Mn and Zn) trace elements in the blue mussel Myalus edulis. PbTxs are a group of neurotoxins known to accumulate in bivalves but also to have lethal effects on a number of marine organisms including fish and mammals. We found that, over 23 days exposure to the radiotracers, the bioaccumulation of the dissolved essential trace elements Co, Mn and Zn in M. edulis was not significantly affected by pre-exposure to toxic K. brevis. In contrast, the uptake rate constant k(u) of Cd was significantly higher in the pre-exposed group (p < 0.05), likely caused by a decrease in mussel clearance rates after K. brevis exposure. These results suggest that the effects of algal toxin exposure on bioaccumulation of trace elements in mussels may be trace element-dependent.

Binding and functional pharmacological characteristics of gepant-type antagonists in rat brain and mesenteric arteries	VASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Binding affinity; CGRP receptor; Schild plot; Gepants; Brain; Mesenteric arteries	GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; HUMAN SUBCUTANEOUS ARTERIES; CGRP RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; N-MC CELLS; CEREBRAL-ARTERIES; CORONARY-ARTERIES; AMYLIN RECEPTORS; BIBN4096BS; MIGRAINE; POTENT	Aim: The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is found in afferent sensory nerve fibers innervating the resistance arteries and plays a pivotal role in a number of neurovascular diseases such as migraine and subarachnoid bleedings. The present study investigates the binding and antagonistic characteristics of small non-peptide CGRP receptor antagonists (i.e. gepants) in isolated rat brain and mesenteric resistance arteries. Methods: The antagonistic behavior of gepants was investigated in isolated rat mesenteric arteries using a wire myograph setup while binding of gepants to CGRP receptors was investigated in rat brain membranes using a radioligand competitive binding assay. Furthermore, the histological location of the key components of CGRP receptor (RAMP1 and CLR) was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Results: Our functional studies clearly show that all gepants are reversible competitive antagonists producing Schild plot slopes not significantly different from unity and thus suggesting presence of a uniform CGRP receptor population in the arteries. A uniform receptor population was also confirmed by radioligand competitive binding studies showing similar affinities for the gepants in rat brain and mesenteric arteries, the exception being rimegepant which had 50-fold lower affinity in brain than mesenteric arteries. CLR and RAMP1 were shown to be located in both vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells of rat mesenteric arteries by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: The present results indicate that, despite species differences in the CGRP receptor affinity, the antagonistic nature of these gepants, the distribution pattern of CGRP receptor components and the mechanism behind CGRP-induced vasodilation seem to be similar in resistance-sized arteries of human and rats.

Todd			Estimation of the binding potential BP<sub>ND</sub> without a reference region or blood samples for brain PET studies	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; IN-VIVO; INPUT FUNCTION; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; NONINVASIVE QUANTIFICATION; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; RECEPTOR-BINDING; VALIDATION; HUMANS	Binding potential (BPND) is a commonly used PET outcome measure because it can be estimated without blood sampling if a brain reference region (RR) devoid of the target of interest exists. For many radioligands however no RR exists and the total distribution volume (V-T) whose estimation requires arterial blood sampling is normally considered as the outcome measure. Here we present a method that allows calculation of BPND without requiring either blood samples or a RR. The method extends our previous algorithm for estimating non-displaceable distribution volumes (V-ND) without using a RR. Here we show that if a template input function with arbitrary amplitude but a shape similar to the actual arterial input function is used in the algorithm estimation of V-T and V-ND are both proportionally biased and thus this bias cancels out in the estimation of BPND. The method is evaluated using simulated data human data acquired with the serotonin 1A receptor radioligand [C-11]WAY-100635 and blocking data acquired in baboons using the serotonin 1A receptor radioligand [C-11]CUMI-101. We evaluated two versions of template input functions: an arbitrarily downscaled version of the actual arterial input function and an unsealed population-based input function. In addition we evaluated how shape modifications of the template input function impact the estimates of BPND. With the downscaled input function BPND values close to the gold standard were obtained. When the unsealed population-based based input function was used greater variability was observed but no discernable bias was introduced. When the input function shape was modified a systematic but small bias in BPND was introduced. We conclude that provided the shape of the arterial input function is adequately described determination of its amplitude is not necessary for estimation of BPND.

Recently, a new radioligand for amyloid senile plaques, C-11-labeled 5-(6-{[tertbutyl(dimethyl)sily]oxy}-1,3-benzothiazol-2-yl)pyridin-2-amine (C-11-AZD2184), was developed, and it was reported to show rapid brain uptake followed by rapid washout. In this study, C-11-AZD2184 binding in control subjects and AD patients was examined in more detail by compartment model analysis using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. The accuracy of simplified quantitative methods using a reference brain region was also evaluated. Methods: After intravenous bolus injection of C-11-AZD2184, a dynamic PET scan was obtained for 90 min in 6 control subjects and 8 AD patients. To obtain the arterial input function, arterial blood sampling and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis were performed. Results: Time activity curves in all brain regions could be described using the standard 2-tissue-compartment model. The total distribution volume ratios to reference region (DVR) in cerebral cortical regions were significantly higher in AD patients than in control subjects. Although there was no conspicuous accumulation of radioactivity in white matter as compared with other amyloid radioligands, DVR values in the centrum semiovale were more than 1 for both control subjects and AD patients, suggesting binding to myelin. The standardized uptake value ratio calculated from integrated time activity curves in brain regions and the reference region was statistically in good agreement with DVR. Conclusion: Although the white matter binding of C-11-AZD2184 may have some effect on cortical measurement, it can be concluded that the kinetic behavior of C-11-AZD2184 is suitable for quantitative analysis. The standardized uptake value ratio can be used as a validated measure of C-11-AZD2184 binding in clinical examinations without arterial input function.

However, only few experimental data are available about muscarinic receptor antagonist function in the urinary bladder from young animals. In the present study, we compare the muscarinic receptor-mediated contractions in juvenile and adult porcine detrusor and the effects of antimuscarinic compounds. Urinary bladders from young (8-12 weeks; 12- to 35-kg body weight) and mature pigs (> 40 weeks; > 100 kg) were compared. Muscarinic receptor expression was assessed by real time polymerase chain reaction and radioligand binding. Muscle contraction was measured with a force transducer; L-type Ca2+ currents (I (Ca,L)) of isolated detrusor myocytes were recorded with standard voltage clamp technique. Juvenile and adult detrusor expressed similar quantities of the messenger RNA of M-2 and M-3 receptors. The number of [H-3]QNB-binding sites and their affinity for the radioligand were also similar between juvenile and adult detrusor. In contrast, maximum contractile responses to the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol were slightly larger in juvenile than adult bladders. On the other hand, carbachol was slightly less potent in juvenile than in adult tissue. The M-3 antagonist DAU 5884 and the spasmolytic drug propiverine inhibited contractile responses with comparable efficacies and potencies in juvenile and adult tissue. I (Ca,L) was somewhat smaller in juvenile than in adult cells. Taken together, these data suggest that expression and function of M-2 and M-3 receptors are similar in the detrusor of juvenile and mature pigs. Therefore, similar responses to antimuscarinic compounds could be expected in young and adult patients.

The aims of the present study were to obtain information concerning the changes in the ER and the progesterone receptor (PR) in early pregnancy and to determine the alterations in the ER subtype mRNA in the pregnant rat uterus. To demonstrate the ER and PR densities, radioligand saturation assay was used. The reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was applied to characterize the alterations in the ER subtype mRNA. ER expression was highest on day 5 of pregnancy (B-max = 637.40 +/- 76.10 fmol/mg). The PR expression did not change significantly until day 8, but the protein density was increased on day 8 of pregnancy. The ERalpha mRNA expression was active during pregnancy, maximum expression was attained on day 5; a gradual decrease was then observed until the second half of pregnancy when its expression continuously increased up to the day of labor (day 22). Since the attachment of the blastocyst, an event that is dependent on estradiol in the progesterone-primed uterus of the rat, occurs on day 5 of pregnancy and the levels of the ER protein and the ERalpha mRNA on day 5 of pregnancy was the highest, it could be supposed that this subtype of ER might regulate implantation. The ERbeta mRNA was detected only from day 7 to day 15 with a maximum level on day 8. The expression of thin ER subtype might be related to the development of decidual tissue.

We evaluated the significance of anti-CYP2A6 and anti-CYP1A2 in several hepatic diseases in the absence of APS-1. Methods: A radioligand assay (RLA) based on immunoprecipitation of [S-35]-methionine-labeled CYP2A6 and CYP1A2 was used. Four hundred and thirty subjects with chronic viral hepatitis (n = 185), autoimmune liver diseases (n = 181), autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD, n = 31) and healthy (n = 33) were tested. Results: Seven out of 366 patients with liver diseases were anti-CYP2A6 positive. Neither healthy nor ARD patients showed anti-CYP2A6. One out of 181 patients with autoimmune liver diseases tested anti-CYP2A6 positive. A significantly higher prevalence of anti-CYP2A6 (P < 0.05) was detected with six out of seven patients positive in the viral hepatitis group. The latter were infected by flaviviruses (1 HGV/GBVC, 5 HCV). 4/5 HCV/anti-CYP2A6 positive sera were positive for anti-LKM-1 by immunofluorescence and for anti-CYP2D6 by RLA. None of the 430 sera recognized CYP1A2. Conclusions: For the first time CYP2A6 is reported as a hepatic autoantigen in patients with viral hepatitis caused by flaviviruses and in particular in HCV/anti-LKM-1 positive patients. Multicenter studies are needed in order to investigate the clinical importance of this novel finding. This study further supports that anti-CYP2A6 in the absence of flavivirus is rather limited to APS-1. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of European Association for the Study of the Liver.

While cases of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) have been described as a consequence of Lu-177 dotatate, there are no reports of hemolytic anemia associated with therapy. We present a case of a 68-year-old woman with metastatic low-grade neuroendocrine tumor who presented four weeks after the second dose of Lu-177 dotatate with progressive fatigue and dyspnea. Laboratory workup was remarkable for hemolytic anemia. Lutetium-177 dotatate-induced hemolysis was suspected after ruling out other causes. Corticosteroid treatment was initiated with improvement in hemoglobin, and dose-reduced PRRT was planned upon discharge. Six months into the treatment course of Lu-177 dotatate, macrocytic anemia was noticed on routine follow-up with normal vitamin B12 and folic acid levels. A bone marrow biopsy was done, revealing myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) features. Given the temporal relationship between drug introduction and the objective findings, early-onset Lu-177 dotatate- induced MDS was diagnosed with a plan for close hematologic follow-up. Myelodysplastic syndrome should be suspected when megaloblastic anemia develops in patients with previous Lu-177 dotatate therapy. The latency period between initial treatment and MDS diagnosis reported in the literature ranges between 15 months to seven years. Apart from the unusually early onset of MDS, what is unique about our case is the development of hemolytic anemia after administration of PRRT. The clinical course and the brisk response to steroid therapy, suggest other mechanisms of PRRT toxicity besides DNA breaks, genetic mutations, and myelosuppression by an immunemediated component that likely plays a role in Lu-177 dotatate toxicity. Further investigation and monitoring are needed to identify the frequency of such adverse events and the pathophysiology of their occurrence.

Presently, there are no selective alpha SYN positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands that do not also show affinity to amyloid-beta (A beta). We have previously shown that radiolabeled antibodies, engineered to enter the brain via the transferrin receptor (TfR), is a promising approach for PET imaging of intrabrain targets. In this study, we used this strategy to visualize alpha SYN in the living mouse brain. Five bispecific antibodies, binding to both the murine TfR and alpha SYN were generated and radiolabeled with iodine-125 or iodine-124. All bispecific antibodies bound to alpha SYN and mTfR before and after radiolabelling in an ELISA assay, and bound to brain sections prepared from alpha SYN overexpressing mice as well as human PD- and MSA subjects, but not control tissues in autoradiography. Brain concentrations of the bispecific antibodies were be-tween 26 and 63 times higher than the unmodified IgG format 2 h post-injection, corresponding to about 1.5% of the injected dose per gram brain tissue. Additionally, intrastriatal alpha SYN fibrils were visualized with PET in an alpha SYN deposition mouse model with one of the bispecific antibodies, [I-124]RmAbSynO2-scFv8D3. However, PET images acquired in alpha SYN transgenic mice with verified brain pathology injected with [I-124]RmAbSynO2-scFv8D3 and [I-124]RmAb48-scFv8D3 showed no increase in antibody retention compared to WT mice. Despite successful imaging of deposited extracellular alpha SYN using a brain-penetrating antibody-based radioligand with no cross-specificity towards A beta, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates challenges in imaging intracellular alpha SYN inclusions present in synucleinopathies.

Harnessing <SUP>64</SUP>Cu/<SUP>67</SUP>Cu for a theranostic approach to pretargeted radioimmunotherapy	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						theranostics; positron emission tomography; radioimmunotherapy; pretargeting; pretargeted radioimmunotherapy	ANTIBODY-DRUG CONJUGATE; TRANS-CYCLOOCTENE; TARGETING MESOTHELIN; COLORECTAL-CARCINOMA; PROSTATE-CANCER; BREAST-CANCER; A33 ANTIGEN; PET; CHEMISTRY; BIODISTRIBUTION	Over the past decade, theranostic imaging has emerged as a powerful clinical tool in oncology for identifying patients likely to respond to targeted therapies and for monitoring the response of patients to treatment. Herein, we report a theranostic approach to pretargeted radioimmunotherapy (PRIT) based on a pair of radioisotopes of copper: positron-emitting copper-64 (Cu-64, t(1/2) = 12.7 h) and beta particle-emitting copper-67 (Cu-67, t(1/2) = 61.8 h). This strategy is predicated on the in vivo ligation between a trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-bearing antibody and a tetrazine (Tz)-based radioligand via the rapid and bioorthogonal inverse electron-demand Diels-Alder reaction. Longitudinal therapy studies were conducted in a murine model of human colorectal carcinoma using an immunoconjugate of the huA33 antibody modified with TCO (huA33-TCO) and a Cu-67-labeled Tz radioligand ([Cu-67]Cu-MeCOSar-Tz). The injection of huA33-TCO followed 72 h later by the administration of 18.5, 37.0, or 55.5 MBq of [Cu-67]Cu-MeCOSar-Tz produced a dose-dependent therapeutic response, with the median survival time increasing from 68 d for the lowest dose to >200 d for the highest. Furthermore, we observed that mice that received the highest dose of [Cu-67]Cu-MeCOSar-Tz in a fractionated manner exhibited improved hematological values without sacrificing therapeutic efficacy. Dual radionuclide experiments in which a single administration of huA33-TCO was followed by separate injections of [Cu-64]Cu-MeCOSar-Tz and [Cu-67]Cu-MeCOSar-Tz revealed that the positron emission tomography images produced by the former accurately predicted the efficacy of the latter. In these experiments, a correlation was observed between the tumoral uptake of [Cu-64]Cu-MeCOSar-Tz and the subsequent therapeutic response to [Cu-67]Cu-MeCOSar-Tz.

Links between the two systems in animal models have not been investigated in humans. Methods: Using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]DASB, we studied relationships between 5-HTT binding potential and plasma levels of PUFAs docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and arachidonic acid (AA) in medication-free MDD patients (n = 21). PUFAs were quantified using transesterificafion and gas chromatography. Binding potential BPP, and alternative outcome measures BPF and BPND, were determined for [C-11]DASB in six a priori brain regions of interest (ROIs) using likelihood estimation in graphical analysis (LEGA) to calculate radioligand total distribution volume (V-T), and a validated hybrid deconvolution approach (HYDECA) that estimates radioligand non-displaceable distribution volume (V-ND) without a reference region. Linear mixed models used PUFA levels as predictors and binding potential measures as outcomes across the specified ROIs; age and sex as fixed effects; and subject as random effect to account for across-region binding correlations. As nonlinear relationships were observed, a quadratic term was added to final models. Results: AA predicted both 5-HTT BPp and depression severity nonlinearly, described by an inverted U-shaped curve. 5-HTT binding potential mediated the relationship between AA and depression severity. Limitations: Given the small sample and multiple comparisons, results require replication. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that AA status may impact depression pathophysiology through effects on serotonin transport. Future studies should examine whether these relationships explain therapeutic effects of PUFAs in the treatment of MDD.	[Gopaldas, Manesh; Zanderigo, Francesca; Ogden, R.

Small Molecule Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor (AT2R) Antagonists as Novel Analgesics for Neuropathic Pain: Comparative Pharmacokinetics, Radioligand Binding, and Efficacy in Rats	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						Pharmacokinetics; Oral Bioavailability; Angiotensin II Type 2 Receptor (AT2R) Antagonist; Neuropathic Pain; Analgesia; Radioligand Binding	INVOLVEMENT; LOSARTAN; CLONING; KINASE	Objective Neuropathic pain is an area of unmet clinical need. The objective of this study was to define the pharmacokinetics, oral bioavailability, and efficacy in rats of small molecule antagonists of the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) for the relief of neuropathic pain. Design and Methods. Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats received single intravenous (110mg/kg) or oral (510mg/kg) bolus doses of EMA200, EMA300, EMA400 or EMA401 (S-enantiomer of EMA400). Blood samples were collected immediately pre-dose and at specified times over a 12- to 24-hour post-dosing period. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure plasma drug concentrations. Efficacy was assessed in adult male SD rats with a unilateral chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve. Results. After intravenous administration in rats, mean (+/- standard error of the mean) plasma clearance for EMA200, EMA300, EMA400, and EMA401 was 9.3, 6.1, 0.7, and 1.1L/hour/kg, respectively. After oral dosing, the dose-normalized systemic exposures of EMA400 and EMA401 were 20- to 30-fold and 50- to 60-fold higher than that for EMA300 and EMA200, respectively. The oral bioavailability of EMA400 and EMA401 was similar at approximate to 30%, whereas it was only 5.9% and 7.1% for EMA200 and EMA300, respectively. In CCI rats, single intraperitoneal bolus doses of EMA200, EMA300, and EMA400 evoked dose-dependent pain relief. The pain relief potency rank order in CCI rats was EMA400>EMA300>EMA200 in agreement with the dose-normalized systemic exposure rank order in SD rats. Conclusion. The small molecule AT2R antagonist, EMA401, is in clinical development as a novel analgesic for the relief of neuropathic pain.

Thus, this study was carried out to characterize the alpha(1) AR subtype gene and protein expression in proximal, medial, and distal region of the human ureter. Methods: Molecular characterization of alpha(1) AR subtypes were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. alpha(1) AR protein expression was studied by saturation binding curves and by competition binding curves with selective antagonists. Analysis of data was performed using the GraphPad PRISM 4 software. Results: Analysis of saturation binding curves revealed a heterogeneous distribution of alpha(1) AR binding sites, the B-max for the distal ureter was indeed 52.5 +/- 5.4 fmol/mg prot, while a lower similar density of alpha(1) ARs was demonstrated in the medial (25.2 +/- 1.7 fmol/mg prot) and proximal (23.4 +/- 0.4 fmol/mg prot) ureters. Molecular and pharmacological characterization of alpha(1) AR subtypes indicated that each receptor was present, although with differences in terms of the amount expressed. Conclusions: Human ureter was endowed with each alpha(1) AR subtype, although alpha(1D) and alpha(1A) ARs were prevalent over alpha(1B) ARs. Radioligand binding results revealed that there were no significant differences in the K-d between ureteral regions, while a heterogeneous distribution of alpha(1) AR binding sites was detected, with the highest density of alpha(1) ARs in the distal ureter and a lower similar density in the medial and proximal ureters.

J	Wang, LC; Cui, XN; Chen, NH; Reith, MEA				Wang, LC; Cui, XN; Chen, NH; Reith, MEA			Binding of cocaine-like radioligands to the dopamine transporter at 37°C:: effect of Na<SUP>+</SUP> and substrates	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						dopamine transporter; dopamine; D-amphetamine; p-tyramine; DL-octopamine; CFT; CIT	ACID ISOPROPYL ESTER; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; NEURONAL UPTAKE; RAT-BRAIN; GBR 12783; K+; TEMPERATURE; AMPHETAMINE; DEPENDENCE	Although dopamine (DA) translocation by the DA transporter (DAT) requires Na+, a role for Na+ in the DA recognition step in the translocation cycle has been questioned. Thus, when binding techniques were used to indirectly measure the affinity of DA for DAT via its potency in inhibiting cocaine analog binding, no stimulation of DA binding was observed when assay temperature was at or below room temperature. The present work describes the use of 3 H-labeled cocaine analogs for assays at 37 degreesC. When there is sufficient Na+ in the medium (greater than or equal to25 mM), [H-3]2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([H-3]CIT) is an excellent radioligand to label human DAT with high affinity in membrane preparations of HEK-293 cells expressing the transporter. However, at 0 and 5 mM of Na+, appreciable binding of [H-3]CIT occurs to proteins other than DAT, hampering accurate assessment of DAT-associated binding. No such problems occur with the binding of the 4-fluoro homolog of [H-3]CIT, [H-3]CFT at 37degreesC, and this radioligand can be used at low [Na+], provided enough protein is present in the assay. The application of these assays show that, in contrast to the strong Na+ dependency of the binding of CFT, the substrates DA, D-amphetamine, p-tyramine, and DL-octopamine are not stimulated by Na+. This demonstrates that lack of Na+ stimulation of binding of substrates, including DA to DAT, in membrane preparations at room temperature is not caused by the reduced fluidity of the frozen state of the hydrocarbon membrane interior at this temperature as compared with the liquid-expanded state at 37degreesC.

Investigation of Copper-64-Based Host-Guest Chemistry Pretargeted Positron Emission Tomography	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article; Early Access						positron emission tomography; pretargeting; host-guest chemistry; carcinoembryonic antigen; copper-64	PATIENT-SPECIFIC DOSIMETRY; FUSION PROTEIN; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; ANTIBODY; OPTIMIZATION; ANTIGEN; TRIAL; PET	Pretargeting is a technique that uses macromolecules as targeting agents for nuclear imaging and therapy with the goal of reducing the radiation toxicity to healthy tissues often associated with directly radiolabeled macromolecules. In pretargeting, a macromolecule is radiolabeled in vivo at the target site using a radiolabeled small molecule (radioligand) that interacts with the macromolecule with high specificity. We report an investigation of host-guest chemistry-driven pretargeting using copper-64 radiolabeled ferrocene (Fc; guest) compounds and a cucurbit[7]uril (CB7; host) molecule functionalized carcinoembryonic antigen targeting hT84.66-M5A monoclonal antibody (CB7-M5A). Two novel ferrocene-based radioligands ([Cu-64]Cu-NOTA-PEG3-Fc and [Cu-64]Cu-NOTA-PEG7-Fc) were prepared, and their in vitro stability, pharmacokinetic in vivo profile in healthy mice, and pretargeting performance in a subcutaneous BxPC3 human pancreatic cancer cell xenograft mouse model were compared. The antibody dosing was optimized using a zirconium-89 radiolabeled M5A antibody ([Zr-89]Zr-DFO-M5A) in a BxPC3 xenograft model, and the dosimetry of [Zr-89]Zr-DFO-M5A and the pretargeting approach were compared. Finally, the effects of varying lag times up to 9 days between CB7-M5A and radioligand injection were investigated. In vivo pretargeting studies with both ferrocene radioligands resulted in specific tumor uptake (p = 0.0006 and p = 0.003) and also showed that the host-guest-based pretargeting approach excels with extended lag times up to 9 days with good tumor localization, suggesting that host-guest pretargeting may be suitable for use without clearing agents which have complicated clinical application of this technique. To our knowledge, the reported lag time of 9 days is the longest investigated lag time in any reported pretargeting studies.	[Jallinoja, Vilma I.

Anesthesia is often inevitable when the investigations are performed in animals. In the present study, we tested effects of four commonly-used anesthetics: isoflurane, pentobarbital, chloral hydrate and ketamine, on in vivo VMAT2 binding to F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ, a specific VMAT2 radioligand, in rat brain. Methods: The transient equilibrium time window for in vivo binding of F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ after a bolus injection was firstly determined. The brain biodistribution studies under anesthetized and awake rats were then performed at the equilibrium time. Standard uptake values (SUVs) of the interest brain regions: the striatum (ST), hippocampus (HP), cortex (CC) and cerebellum (CB) were obtained; and ratios of tissue to cerebellum were calculated. Results: Isoflurane and pentobarbital did not alter distribution of F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ in the brain relative to the awake group; neither SUVs nor ratios of ST/CB and HP/CB were altered significantly. Chloral hydrate significantly increased SUVs of all the brain regions, but did not significantly alter ratios of ST/CB and HP/CB. Ketamine significantly increased SUVs of the striatum, hippocampus and cortex, and insignificantly increased the SUV of the cerebellum; consequently, ketamine significantly increased ratios of ST/CB and HP/CB. Conclusions: It is concluded that in vivo VMAT2 binding to F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ are not altered by isoflurane and pentobarbital, but altered by chloral hydrate and ketamine. Isoflurane and pentobarbital may be promising anesthetic compounds for investigating in vivo VMAT2 binding. Further studies are warranted to investigate the interactions of anesthetics with VMAT2 binding potential with in vivo PET studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Agonist potency at P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors is modulated by structurally diverse lipids	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X(7); lysolipids; BzATP; ATP; interleukin-1 beta	ARACHIDONIC-ACID; INTERLEUKIN-1-BETA RELEASE; CHANNEL FUNCTION; CATION CHANNELS; LYSOPHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE; ATP; LYSOPHOSPHOLIPIDS; ACTIVATION; SPHINGOSYLPHOSPHORYLCHOLINE; IL-1-BETA	Background and purpose: The P2X(7) receptor exhibits a high degree of plasticity with agonist potency increasing after prolonged receptor activation. In this study we investigated the ability of lipids to modulate agonist potency at P2X7 receptors. Experimental approach: A variety of lipids, including lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingosylphosphorylcholine and hexadecylphosphorylcholine were studied for their effect on P2X(7) receptor-stimulated ethidium bromide accumulation in cells expressing human recombinant P2X(7) receptors and on P2X(7) receptor-stimulated interleukin-1 beta (IL1 beta) release from THP-1 cells. The effects of the lipids were also assessed in radioligand binding studies on human P2X(7) receptors. Key results: At concentrations (3-30 mu M) below the threshold to cause cell lysis, the lipids increased agonist potency and/or maximal effects at P2X(7) receptors in both ethidium accumulation and IL1b release studies. There was little structure activity relationship ( SAR) for this effect and sub- lytic concentrations of Triton X- 100 partially mimicked the effects of the lipids. The lipids caused cell lysis and increased intracellular calcium at higher concentrations ( 30- 100 mu M) which complicated interpretation of their effects in functional studies. However, the lipids ( 3- 100 mu M) also increased agonist potency 30- 100 fold in radioligand binding studies. Conclusions and implications: This study demonstrates that a diverse range of lipids increase agonist potency at the P2X(7) receptor in functional and binding studies. The broad SAR, including the effect of Triton X- 100, suggests this may reflect changes in membrane properties rather than a direct effect on the P2X(7) receptor. Since many of the lipids studied accumulate in disease states they may enhance P2X(7) receptor function under pathophysiological conditions.

[<SUP>123</SUP>I]epidepride binding to cerebellar dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptors is displaceable:: Implications for the use of cerebellum as a reference region	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						cerebellum; epidepride; SPECT; occupancy; modeling	NAIVE SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; HUMAN BRAIN; QUANTIFICATION; EPIDEPRIDE; AFFINITY; PET	The low density of cerebellar dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors provides the basis for using the cerebellum as a representation of free- and non-specifically bound radioligand in positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. With the development of ultra high-affinity dopamine D-2/D-3 ligands like [I-123]epidepride, [F-18]fallypride, and [C-11]FLB-457, quantification of extrastriatal low density receptor populations including the cerebellum is possible with important implications for calculation of binding parameters. [I-123]epidepride-SPECT was performed in 23 patients with schizophrenia before and after 3 months of antipsychotic treatment with either risperidone (n = 14) or zuclopenthixol (n = 9). In the unblocked situation and partially blocked situation, the average distribution volumes were 5.2 +/- 1.3 mL/mL and 4.0 +/- 0.8 mL/mL, respectively. The paired distribution volumes were reduced by 22 +/- 15% (mean:LSD) after antipsychotic treatment (p < 0.0001, paired Student's t-test). From the paired distribution volumes in cerebellum and extrastriatal regions, the average distribution volume representing free and non-specifically bound [(123)]epidepride was calculated to be 3.3 +/- 0.8 mL/mL. Both the % [I-123]epidepride fraction of plasma radioactivity (p > 0.76) and the plasma [I-123]epidepride concentration (p > 0.45) were unchanged after antipsychotic treatment (paired Student's t-test). These results strongly suggest the presence of "nonnegligible" specific [I-123] lepidepride binding to dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors in the cerebellum. Using the cerebellum as a representation of free and non-specifically bound radioligand and neglecting the specifically bound component may lead to results that erroneously imply that antipsychotic drugs bind to extrastriatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors with a higher affinity than to striatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors.

Methods: cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using total RNA from human embryo brain tissue as the template. The PCR products were subcloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 and cloned into the plasmid pcDNA3.1. The cloned D1R cDNA was sequenced and stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Expression of D1R in HEK293 cells was monitored by the [H-3]SCH23390 binding assay. The function of D1R was studied by the cAMP accumulation assay, CRE-SEAP reporter gene activity assay, and intracellular calcium assay. Results: An HEK293 cell line stably expressing human D1R was obtained. A saturation radioligand binding experiment with [H-3]SCH23390 demonstrated that the K-d and B-max values were 1.5 +/- 0.2 nmol/L and 2.94 +/- 0.15 nmol/g of protein, respectively. In the [3H]SCH23390 competition assay, D1R agonist SKF38393 displaced [H-3]SCH23390 with an IC50 value of 2.0 (1.5-2.8) mumol/L. SKF38393 increased the intracellular cAMP level and CRE-SEAP activity through D1R expressed in HEK293 cells in a concentration-dependent manner with an EC50 value of 0.25 (0.12-0.53) mumol/L and 0.39 (0.27-0.57) mumol/L at 6 h/0.59 (0.22-1.58) mumol/L at 12 h, respectively. SKF38393 also increased the intracellular calcium level in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 value of 27 (8.6-70) nmol/L. Conclusion: An HEK293 cell line stably expressing human D1R was obtained successfuly. The study also demonstrated that the CRE-SEAP activity assay could be substituted for the cAMP accumulation assay for measuring increase in cAMP levels. Thus, both intracellular calcium measurements and the CRE-SEAP activity assay are suitable for high-throughput screening in drug research.

The goal of this study was to provide dosimetry estimates for C-11-DASB based on human whole-body PET. Methods: Dynamic whole-body PET scans were acquired for 7 subjects after the injection of 669 +/- 97 MBq (18.1 +/- 2.6 mCi) of C-11-DASB. The acquisition for each subject was obtained at 14 time points for a total of 115 min after injection of the radioligand. Regions of interest were placed over compressed planar images of source organs that could be visually identified to generate time-activity curves. Radiation burden to the body was calculated from residence times of these source organs using the MIRDOSE3.1 program. Results: The organs with high radiation burden included the lungs, urinary bladder wall, kidneys, gallbladder wall, heart wall, spleen, and liver. The activity peaked within 10 min after the injection of C-11-DASB for all these organs except two-the excretory organs gallbladder and urinary bladder wall, which had peak activities at 32 and 22 min, respectively. Monoexponential fitting of activity overlying the urinary bladder suggested that approximately 12% of activity was excreted via the urine. Simulations in which the urinary voiding interval was decreased from 4.8 to 0.6 h produced only modest effects on the dose to the urinary bladder wall. With a 2.4-h voiding interval, the calculated effective dose was 6.98 muGy/MBq (25.8 mrem/mCi). Conclusion: The estimated radiation burden of C-11-DASB is relatively modest and would allow multiple PET examinations of the same research subject per year.

Three experimental approaches were used to estimate the distribution of betaAR subtypes in adipocytes. Two approaches involved simultaneous linear regression analysis of multiple competitive displacement curves with the beta(1)AR-selective antagonist CGP 20712A and the beta(2)AR-selective ligand BRL 37344. For the third approach, radioligand saturation assays were perfomed using a concentration of CGP 20712A that completely blocked the beta(1)AR. All three approaches indicated the presence of multiple betaAR subtypes in porcine adipocytes and gave similar estimates for the proportion of these subtypes. Saturation assays in the presence of the beta(1)AR blocker CGP 20712A were conducted to determine the distribution of the betaAR subtypes in skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and liver. The proportions of the beta(1)AR and beta(2)AR were 81:19, 59:41, 72:28, 58:42, and 50:50 for adipose, skeletal muscle, heart, lung, and liver, respectively. These estimates based on receptor protein were consistent with published estimates of mRNA abundance in pig tissues but differ from estimates for other species. The predominance of beta(1)AR in adipocytes and skeletal muscle may contribute to the reduced efficacy of select betaAR agonists in pigs compared to other species because most of the ligands evaluated in growth studies are purported to be beta(2)AR selective. The density of the betaAR varied among tissues in the following order: heart = lung > adipocytes > skeletal muscle greater than or equal to liver.

The use of PET had advantages over ex vivo radioligand binding methods in that it produced parametric image volumes and reduced errors due to inter-rat variability. Time-radioactivity curves from regions of interest (ROI) acquired from individual rats enabled the estimation of specific binding of the radioligand using a compartmental model with reference tissue input. Binding potential (BP) of [C-11]WAY 100635 was estimated for frontal cortex and hippocampus (postsynaptic), and midbrain raphe nuclei (presynaptic). In the latter ROI, pindolol dose-dependently decreased BP. The saturation curve could be fitted to a single-site model up to the lowest dose of pindolol used, giving an ED50 (dose to cause 50% occupancy) value of 0.26 +/- 0.05 mg/kg, and inclusion of control (nonpindolol-treated) rats did not affect the fit. In contrast, in cortex and hippocampus ROI, low doses of pindolol caused an increase in BP compared with controls. Pindolol doses greater than similar to 0.1 mg/kg, resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in BP, and ED50 values in cortex and hippocampus were estimated as 0.44 +/- 0.13 and 0.48 +/- 0.12 mg/kg, respectively. The increase in [C-11]WAY 100635 binding at low pindolol doses is feasibly related to a decrease in basal receptor occupancy following reduced release of endogenous 5-HT. Considering the apparently greater potency of pindolol at the midbrain raphe ROI, this effect could be mediated via agonist activity at the autoreceptor. Synapse 36:330-341, 2000.

J	Christopoulos, A; Grant, MKO; El-Fakahany, EE				Christopoulos, A; Grant, MKO; El-Fakahany, EE			Transducer abstraction - A novel approach to the detection of partial agonist efficacy in radioligand binding studies	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						agonism; affinity; efficacy; ternary complex model; radioligand binding; GTP-shift	MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE INHIBITION; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; TERNARY COMPLEX MODEL; GUANINE-NUCLEOTIDES; AFFINITY; SELECTIVITY; MCN-A-343; LIGAND; HEART	The properties of the ternary complex model (TCM) of drug action at G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were examined, using theoretical computer simulations, with regard to the predicted effects of the presence of a fixed concentration of one agonist on the competition binding profile of another. Subsequently, the binding properties of the full muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonists acetylcholine (ACh) and carbachol (CCh), and the partial agonists pilocarpine and McN-A-343, were investigated in competition experiments against [H-3]N-methylscopolamine using homogenate preparations from Chinese hamster ovary cells, stably expressing the human M-1 or M-2 mAChR. At the M-2 mAChR, all agonists displayed biphasic binding curves and were readily modulated by the nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue, Gpp(NH)p, in accordance with previously established experimental observations. In contrast, agonist binding at the MI mAChR showed no significant change in the presence of Gpp(NH)p, even in the case of a full agonist. This phenomenon precludes using the "GTP-shift" to assess agonist efficacy at the M-1 mAChR. When the ACh competition curves were reconstructed in the presence of graded concentrations of either a full or a partial agonist, a significant redistribution of the fraction of the high - affinity state recognized by ACh was observed. However, when the procedure was repeated using the antagonist, atropine, no significant effect on the fraction of either the high or low affinity ACh binding components at the mAChR was observed. Taken together, these results indicate that changes in the profile of full agonist binding isotherms, when constructed in the presence of a partial agonist, may be more sensitive indicators of partial agonist efficacy than regular assays that directly measure partial agonist binding.

Its inhibition constant (K (i) ) for cloned human dopamine D-4.2 receptor was determined to be 2.9 nM and it displayed a 2000-fold D-4-selectivity over the D-2long subtype. Its partition coefficient (logP) was measured to be 1.11. Biodistribution, blocking distribution and metabolism studies in rats demonstrated that the specific distribution of [F-18]FHTP in brain regions, suggesting that [F-18]FHTP may be a suitable PET imaging agent for in vivo studies of the dopamine D-4 receptor.

We have also shown that the N111G mutant induces homologous internalization through mediation of the AT(1)-receptor antagonist valsartan. In this study we demonstrated that other AT(1)-receptor antagonists, candesartan, losartan, and telmisartan, also stimulate internalization of N111G mutant receptor to the same extent. We further showed that the internalization pattern is also similar for all the AT(1)-receptor antagonists.

These functionalities suggest a role for the cannabinoid receptor (CB) in mediating biological effects. Competitive radioligand binding assays identified cyanidin (K-i = 16.2 mu M) and delphinidin (K-i = 21.3 mu M) as ligands with moderate affinity to human CB1. For CB2, similar affinities were achieved by cyanidin (K-i = 33.5 mu M), delphinidin (K-i = 34.3 mu M), and peonidin (K-i = 46.4 mu M). Inhibition constants > 50 mu M were obtained for pelargonidin, malvidin, cyanidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-galactoside, and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside for both CB subtypes.

PET and SPECT data are commonly analyzed by applying tracer kinetic models. These modeling approaches assume a compartmental system and derive the outcome measure called the binding potential, which reflects the densities of transporters or receptors in a brain region of interest. New models are often noninvasive in that they do not require arterial blood sampling. In this review, the concept and principles of tracer kinetic modeling are introduced and commonly used PET and SPECT neuroreceptor quantification models are discussed.

Methods We analyzed data from the reimbursement.INFO tool based on German hospitals' quality reports for Lutetium-(177) PSMA RLT from 2016 to 2020 and from the nationwide German hospital billing database (Destatis) for general therapy with open radionuclides in combination with prostate cancer from 2006 to 2020. For validation of these billing data, we included the Lu-177-PSMA RLT cycles from two participating institutions from 2016 to 2020. For detection of trends over time we applied linear regression models. Results General therapy with open radionuclides increased from 2006 to 2020. We identified a total of 12,553 Lu-177-PSMA RLT cycles. The number of Lu-177-PSMA RLTs steadily increased from a total of 1026 therapies in 2016 to 3328 therapies in 2020 (+ 576 RLT/year; p < 0.005). In 2016, 25 departments of nuclear medicine offered this treatment, which increased to 44 nuclear medicine departments in 2020. In 2016, 16% of nuclear medicine departments (4/25) performed more than 100 Lu-177-PSMA RLTs, which increased to 36% (16/44) in 2020 (p < 0.005). In 2016, 88% (22/25) of 177Lu-PSMA RLTs were performed at a university hospital, which decreased to 70% (31/44) in 2020. The proportion of patients older than 65 years receiving Lu-177-PSMA RLT increased from 78% in 2016 to 81% in 2020. Conclusion Treatment of mCRPC with Lu-177-PSMA RLT has been rapidly increasing in Germany in the recent years providing an additional therapy option. This development is remarkable, because of outstanding formal EMA approval.

One recently discovered ligand is JNJ-64413739 that binds selectively to the purinergic receptor P2X7R. The expression of P2X7R is increased under inflammation; hence, the ligand is considered useful in the detection of neuroinflammation in the brain. [18F]JNJ-64413739 has been evaluated in healthy subjects with positron emission tomography; however, the in vitro binding properties of the ligand in human brain tissue have not been investigated. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to measure Bmax and Kd of [3H]JNJ-64413739 using autoradiography on human cortical tissue sections resected from a total of 48 patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Correlations between the specific binding of [3H]JNJ-64413739 with age, sex, and duration of disease were explored. Finally, to examine the relationship between P2X7R and TSPO availability, specific binding of [3H]JNJ-64413739 and [123I]CLINDE was examined in the same tissue. The binding was measured in both cortical gray and subcortical white matter. Saturation revealed a Kd (5 nM) value similar between gray and white matter but a larger Bmax in the white than in the gray matter. The binding was completely displaced by the cold ligand and structurally different P2X7R ligands. The variability in saturable binding among the samples was found to be 38% in gray and white matter but was not correlated to either age, sex, or the duration of the disease. Interestingly, there was no significant correlation between [3H]JNJ-64413739 and [123I]CLINDE binding. These data demonstrate that [3H]JNJ-64413739 is a suitable radioligand for evaluating the distribution and expression of the P2X7R in the human brain.

INVESTIGATIVE AND CLINICAL UROLOGY			English	Article						Lutetium-177; Lymphatic metastasis; Prostate cancer; PSMA-617	ANDROGEN-DEPRIVATION THERAPY; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; EXPERIENCE; PREDICTORS; OUTCOMES; SAFETY	Purpose: Lutetium labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy (Lu-PSMA RLT) has shown pleasing early results in management of high-volume metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), but its role in the early treatment of men with only lymph node metastasis (LNM) is unknown. The aim was to assess the outcome of Lu-PSMA RLT earlier in the treatment of men with only LNM. Materials and Methods: Single institution retrospective review of men with only LNM on staging Ga-PSMA PET PSMA who proceeded with Lu-PSMA RLT. Results: There were 17 men with only LNM, including 13 with mCRPC and 3 who were both hormone and chemotherapy naive. The median PSA was 3.7 (0.46-120 ng/mL). A PSA decline of >= 50% occurred in 10/17 (58.8%), decreasing to <0.2 ng/mL in 35.3% (6/17). The PSA continues to decline or remain stable in 10/17 (58.8%) with a median follow-up of 13 months, and 8/17 (47.1%) have not reached their pre-treatment levels. There were no significant side effects. There was a better PSA response in men without prior chemotherapy (p=0.05). The prostate cancer specific and overall survival is 82.4% (14/17). Conclusions: Our results identify improved PSA response to Lu-PSMA RLT in men with only LNM, especially in the chemotherapy naive cohort, compared to previous series with more advanced mCRPC. These findings provide important proof of principle to aid with planning of future prospective randomized trials evaluating the role of Lu-PSMA RLT earlier in the management of node metastatic prostate cancer, including men naive of ADT and chemotherapy.

However, PRLT has side effects on the salivary glands that limit the safety of the treatment. The current study aimed to show the effect of external cooling with ice packs on Lu-177-PSMA-617 uptake by the parotid glands (PGs). Methods: The study included 19 patients (mean age, 72.9 y) with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had been referred for the first time for Lu-177-PSMA-617 treatment and underwent pretreatment Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT. Before the initiation of PRLT, the SUVmax and SUVmean of the right and left PGs were measured on Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT. Frozen ice packs were then affixed over the right PG of each patient for approximately 5 h; 1 h after they were affixed, PRLT was administered. At 4 h after PRLT, head-and-neck SPECT/CT was performed, and at both 4 and 24 h after PRLT, whole-body planar scintigraphy was performed. Regions and volumes of interest were applied for the right and left PGs, and the counts and volumes were determined. Results: Before PRLT, Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT showed no significant difference in SUVmax or SUVmean between the right and left PGs (P > 0.05). At 4 and 24 h after PRLT, planar imaging showed no significant difference in counts between the cooled and noncooled PGs (P > 0.05). Furthermore, at 4 h after PRLT, SPECT/CT showed no significant difference in counts or volumes between the cooled and noncooled PGs (P. 0.05). Conclusion: External cooling does not reduce uptake of Lu-177-PSMA-617 by the PGs.

We evaluated patient response to the second and third cycles of RLT in patients that underwent at least three cycles. The second aim of this study was to calculate the median overall survival (OS) of responders and non-responders after the first cycle and after all three cycles of RLT. Methods CRPC patients were treated with Lu-PSMA, with a median interval of 8 weeks between each cycle. The tumour marker prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as the marker for response evaluation. Results Fifty-two patients underwent a total of 190 cycles of RLT (3-6 cycles per patient). Of these, 80.8% showed a decline in PSA 2 months after the first cycle, with 44.2% showing a PSA decline of >= 50%. When compared to baseline PSA, 73.1% showed a PSA decline after the third cycle. 50% of patients that did not show any response to the first cycle also did not respond to the second and third cycles. The median OS was 60 weeks in all patients. The median OS was significantly longer for patients that showed any PSA decline after the first cycle compared to patients without PSA decline (68 vs. 33 weeks). There was a significant difference in median OS between responders and non-responders for a change in PSA after the third cycle compared to baseline PSA. Conclusion Patients with a positive response to RLT, regardless of the rate of decline, had a significantly longer median OS. Of the patients that did not show any response to the first cycle, 50% responded to the second or third cycles.

Since traditional in vitro methods belong to dose-dependent assessments, binding kinetics is usually overlooked. The present study aimed at the establishment of two novel experimental approaches for the assessment of binding affinity of both, radiolabelled and non-labelled compounds targeting the A(3)R, based on high-resolution real-time data acquisition of radioligand-receptor binding kinetics. A novel time-resolved competition assay was developed and applied to determine the K-i of eight different A(3)R antagonists, using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the hA(3)R. In addition, a new kinetic real-time cell-binding approach was established to quantify the rate constants k(on) and k(off), as well as the dedicated K-d of the A(3)R agonist [I-125]-AB-MECA. Furthermore, lipophilicity measurements were conducted to control influences due to physicochemical properties of the used compounds. Results: Two novel real-time cell-binding approaches were successfully developed and established. Both experimental procedures were found to visualize the kinetic binding characteristics with high spatial and temporal resolution, resulting in reliable affinity values, which are in good agreement with values previously reported with traditional methods. Taking into account the lipophilicity of the A(3)R antagonists, no influences on the experimental performance and the resulting affinity were investigated. Conclusions: Both kinetic binding approaches comprise tracer administration and subsequent binding to living cells, expressing the dedicated target protein. Therefore, the experiments resemble better the true in vivo physiological conditions and provide important markers of cellular feedback and biological response.

TSPO radioligands such as [F-18]DPA-714 are useful for the non-invasive study of neuroimmune processes using positron emission tomography (PET). Anesthetic agents were shown to impact mitochondrial function and may influence [F-18]DPA-714 binding parameters and PET kinetics. [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging was performed in Papio anubis baboons anesthetized using either intravenous propofol (n=3) or inhaled isoflurane (n=3). Brain kinetics and metabolite-corrected input function were measured to estimate [F-18]DPA-714 brain distribution (V-T). Displacement experiments were performed using PK11195 (1.5mg/kg). In vitro [F-18]DPA-714 binding experiments were performed using baboon brain tissue in the absence and presence of tested anesthetics. Brain radioactivity peaked higher in isoflurane-anesthetized animals compared with propofol (SUVmax=2.7 +/- 0.5 vs. 1.3 +/- 0.2, respectively) but was not different after 30min. Brain V-T was not different under propofol and isoflurane. Displacement resulted in a 35.8 +/- 8.4% decrease of brain radioactivity under propofol but not under isoflurane (0.1 +/- 7.0%). In vitro, the presence of propofol increased TSPO density and dramatically reduced its affinity for [F-18]DPA-714 compared with control. This invitro effect was not significant with isoflurane. Exposure to propofol and isoflurane differentially influences TSPO interaction with its specific radioligand [F-18]DPA-714 with subsequent impact on its tissue kinetics and specific binding estimated invivo using PET. Therefore, the choice of anesthetics and their potential influence on PET data should be considered for the design of imaging studies using TSPO radioligands, especially in a translational research context.

A study of the GABAergic mechanisms of the neuropsychotropic action of neuroglutam	NEUROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						neuroglutam; derivatives of glutamic acid; antidepressants; anxiolytics; neuroprotectors; GABA; GABA receptors; radioligand binding in vitro and ex vivo	ANTIDEPRESSANT; RGPU-135; BINDING; CORTEX; GABA; CITALOPRAM; RECEPTORS; GLUTARONE	To study the mechanisms of the action of neuroglutam (beta-phenylglutamic acid hydrochloride, RGPU-135), which is a drug with antidepressant and anxiolytic activities, we examined the influence of the antagonist of GABA(A) receptors bicuculline (1 mg/kg) and the antagonist of GABA(B) receptors phaclofen (2 mg/kg) on the type and strength of the effects of neuroglutam (26 mg/kg) in behavioral tests. Anxiolytic effects were examined in the open-field test and dark-light box; antidepressant effects were examined in the tail-suspension test. During combined treatment with neuroglutam and bicuculline, anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of neuroglutam did not occur, i.e., development of these effects requires activation of GABA(A) receptors. Phaclofen counteracted the antidepressant effect of neuroglutam, which, to a certain degree is related to activation of GABA(B) receptors. Neuroglutam (26-650 mg/kg) suppressed seizures that were induced by the blockers of GABA(A) receptors picrotoxin (5 mg/kg) and pentylenetetrazol (90 mg/kg), which reflects its capacity to influence this channel. Analysis of the neuroglutam influence (10-10-10-4 M) on the rat brain GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors by the method of radioligand binding in vitro using tritiated [G(3)-H]SR95531 (for GABA(A)) and [G(3)-H](-)Baclofen (for GABA(B) receptors) did not reveal direct interaction of neuroglutam with these receptors. Subchronic systemic administration of neuroglutam (26 mg/kg, daily for 5 days) to rats induced an increase in the density of GABA(A) receptors in the prefrontal cortex, which points to its capacity to modulate the expression of GABA(A) receptors. These data suggest that one of the aspects of the neuropsychotropic effects of neuroglutam is interaction with the GABAergic neurotransmitter system.	[Tyurenkov, I. N.; Bagmetova, V. V.; Robertus, A.

Activated microglia/macrophages play a key role in the immunopathogenesis of MS and its corresponding animal models, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Microglia activation begins at early stages of the disease and is associated with elevated expression of the 18 kDa mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO). Thus, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of microglial activation using TSPO-specific radioligands could be valuable for monitoring disease-associated neuroinflammatory processes. EAE was induced in rats using a fragment of myelin basic protein, yielding acute clinical disease that reflects extensive spinal cord inflammation. Enhanced TSPO expression in spinal cords of EAE rats versus those of controls was confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Biodistribution studies in control and EAE rats were performed using the TSPO radioligand [F-18] DPA-714 [N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy) phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5a] pyrimidin-3-yl) acetamide]. At 1 h after injection, almost fivefold higher levels of [F-18] DPA-714 were measured in spinal cords of EAE rats versus controls. The specific binding of [F-18] DPA-714 to TSPO in spinal cords was confirmed in competition studies, using unlabeled (R,S)-PK11195 [(R,S)-N-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-1-(2-chlorophenyl) isoquinoline-3-carboxamide)] or DPA-714 in excess. MicroPET studies affirm that this differential radioactivity uptake in spinal cords of EAE versus control rats could be detected and quantified. Using [F-18] DPA-714, neuroinflammation in spinal cords of EAE-induced rats could be visualized by PET, offering a sensitive technique for monitoring neuroinflammatory lesions in the CNS and particularly in the spinal cord. In addition to current MRI protocols, this approach could provide molecular images of neuroinflammation for detection, monitoring, and research in MS.

We have investigated the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor in a well-defined series of psychiatric cases using radioligand binding and quantitative immunoblotting techniques. Saturable radioligand binding of [H-3]L-689,560 to the glycine site on this subunit of the NMDA receptor was undertaken in superior temporal cortex of patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and matched control subjects. A tendency towards an increased receptor density was found in schizophrenia. A significant decrease in NMDA receptor density below control value was found in both bipolar and depressive disorders. The immunoblotting technique was used to identify NR1 protein in the same series of cases of which two bands were identified consistent with NR1 splice variants. A tendency to a decrease in the density of the NR1 upper band below control values was found in bipolar and depressed patients, but not schizophrenics. Consistent with this observation, the ratio between the upper and lower NR1-immunoreactive bands showed a significant decrease in bipolar disorder, although the ratio in depression did not reach significance. No significant difference was found in the NR1 lower band in any patient group compared with control. The finding of an increase NMDA receptor density in schizophrenia is consistent with the previous reports, with a possible compensatory response to glutamatergic deficits in superior temporal cortex in schizophrenia. The findings in affective disorders are interesting in respect of reports of cortical NMDA receptor deficits in suicide victims, although antidepressant drug treatment may contribute to these changes.

Use of PET and SPECT in psychiatry	NERVENARZT			German	Article						Positron emission tomography; Single photon emission computed tomography; Radioligand; Neurotransmitter; Transporter	TRANSPORTER OCCUPANCY; BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CITALOPRAM; ALCOHOL	This review presents the basic essentials of the application of nuclear medicine technology in psychiatry, i.e., positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). These include integral principles of physics and radiochemistry as well as of data acquisition and analysis. Significant findings from applications in research and the clinical setting (schizophrenic and affective disorders, substance abuse, dementia) illustrate the huge potential of these methods. They have helped to deepen the understanding of the neurobiology of those disorders and the mechanism of action of psychotropic drugs. Due to its unmatched sensitivity, molecular imaging with PET and SPECT represents an important complement to magnetic resonance imaging technology in research and clinical practice.

We have previously performed computational studies that examine the potential viability of these structures for use in drug design, exploiting known ligand activities. Our previous study and a newly reported beta(2)/Timolol X-ray complex provide validation of the computational approaches. In the present work, we use the X-ray structures to extract, via in silico high-throughput docking, compounds from proprietary and commercial databases and demonstrate the successful identification of active compounds by radioligand binding.

Although the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the anticonvulsant action of gabapentin (GBP) remain incompletely described, in vitro studies have shown that GBP binds to the alpha(2) subunit of the high voltage-activated (HVA) Ca2+ channels. 2. In this report, we analyzed the effects of GBP on the functional expression of HVA Ca2+ channels in the PC12 cell line model system. Negligible inhibition of Ca2+ channel activity was observed after acute treatment, but a significant decrease in Ca2+ current amplitude was promoted by chronic exposure to GBP. 3. Consistent with this, radioligand binding experiments showed a comparable reduction in the total number of membrane HVA N-type channels after GBP treatment.

After the internalization of ligand-receptor complexes, it traffics through different subcellular organelles such as early endosome, recycling endosome, lysosome, etc. Further, after the ligand binding to the receptor, different second messengers are generated, such as cGMP, cAMP, IP3, etc. Several methods have been used, such as radioligand binding assay, western blotting, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy, microRNA/siRNA, and bioassays to understand the various events, such as internalization, subcellular trafficking, signaling, metabolic degradation, etc. This chapter briefly discusses the key principles and methods used to study internalization, subcellular trafficking, signaling, and metabolic degradation of numerous receptors.

Nevertheless, a proportion of patients do not respond to this therapy. Here, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic significance of the pretreatment pathologic and laboratory factors for the prediction of biochemical response to the first cycle of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy. Methods: In this retrospective study, mCRPC patients, referred for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy, were included. We retrieved the data of patients, undergone [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA, from March 2019 to March 2021. Multiple baseline pathologic and laboratory parameters were extracted and correlated with the response to the first cycle. The prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was evaluated six weeks after [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy for the biochemical response. Results: Forty-three patients with a mean age of 69.8 +/- 10.2 were included. Bone and visceral metastases were present in 81.4% and 14.0% of the patients, respectively. Except for two, all patients had received hormone- and chemotherapy. The mean PSA level was 189.9 +/- 259.0 at baseline. Following one cycle of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA, ">= 10% PSA response" and ">= 50% PSA response" were seen in 81.4% and 44.2% of the patients, respectively. Patients with higher baseline PSA more frequently had >= 10% PSA response (p= 0.004). Also, the reduction in the PSA level correlated with baseline PSA (p=0.013, r=0.375). Conclusion: [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy results in the biochemical response in a considerable number of patients after one cycle. In nearly half of patients, PSA declines more than 50%. Higher baseline PSA is correlated with the level of PSA response.

The polymer particles prepared by precipitation polymerization exhibited a regular spherical shape at the micro and nanoscale with a high degree of monodispersity. Moreover, the influence of the polymerization temperature, and the ratio of functional monomer to cross-linker on the size of the obtained particles was investigated. The selectivity of the imprinted micro and nanospheres was evaluated by HPLC analysis and via radioligand binding assays. HPLC separation experiments revealed that the imprinted microspheres provide higher or similar affinity to the template in contrast to imprinted polymers prepared by conventional bulk polymerization or synthesized by multi-step swelling/polymerization methods. ne dimensions of the imprinted nanospheres facilitate suspension in solution rendering them ideal for binding assay applications. Results from saturation and displacement assays prove that the imprinted nanospheres exhibit superior specific affinity to the target molecule in contrast to control materials. The binding properties of the nanospheres including binding isotherms and affinity distribution were studied via Freundlich isotherm affinity distribution (HAD) analysis. Moreover, release experiments show that 70% of rebound 17 beta-estradiol was released from the imprinted nanospheres within the first 2 h, while more intimately bound 17 beta-estradiol molecules (approx. 16%) were released in the following 42 h. Fitting Brunnauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) multi-point adsorption isotherms to the obtained results indicated that the micro and nanospheres are characterized by a comparatively homogenous and narrow distribution of mesopores in contrast to the corresponding bulk polymers.

We have previously reported evidence that related P-linked compounds, lactose and octyl-beta-(D)-mannoside, bind and functionally modulate rodent GABA(A) receptors, respectively. We have characterized the binding pharmacology of synthetic caloporoside and two further congeners, 2-hydroxy-6-{[(16R)-(beta-(D)-mannopyranosyloxy)heptadecyl]} benzoic acid and octyl-beta-(D)-glucoside on GABA(A) receptors using a [S-35] -t-butylbicyclophosphoorothionate (TBPS) radioligand binding assay. Caloporoside and 2-hydroxy-6- {[(16R)-(beta-(D)-mannopyranosyloxy)heptadecyl] I benzoic acid produced concentrationdependent complete inhibition of specific [35S] TBPS binding with overall apparent IC50 values of 14.7 +/- 0.1 and 14.2 +/- 0.1 mu M, respectively. In contrast, octyl-beta-(D)-glucoside elicited a concentration-dependent stimulation of specific [35 S] TBPS binding (E-max 144 +/- 4%; EC50 = 39.2 +/- 22.7 nM). The level of stimulation was similar to that elicited by diazepam (E-max= 147 +/- 6%; EC50 = 0.8 +/- 0.1 nM), and was occluded by GABA (0.3 mu M). However, the three test compounds failed to elicit any significant effect (positive or negative) upon [H-3] flunitrazepam or [H-3] muscimol binding, indicating that they did not bind directly, or allosterically couple, to the benzodiazepine or agonist binding site of the GABAA receptor, respectively. The constituent monosaccharide, glucose, and both the closely related congeners octyl-beta-(D)-glucoside or hexyl-beta-(D)-alucoside have no significant effect upon [35 S] TBPS binding. These data, together, provide strong evidence that a P-glycosidic linkage and chain length are crucial for the positive modulation of [35 S] TBPS binding to the GABAA receptor by this novel chemical class.

The cholinergic systems have roles in various neurophysiologic functions, such as learning, memory, and cognition, whereas normal aging and neurodegenerative diseases have been associated with changes in nAChRs. Recently, 5-iodo-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (5IA) has been synthesized as a radioligand for imaging nAChRs with SPECT. I-123-5IA shows higher affinity toward the nAChR alpha(4)beta(2) subtype, enhanced receptor subtype selectivity, good safety, and low nonspecific binding. Methods: In this study, a SPECT quantitative study of human nAChRs binding with I-123-5IA was conducted in healthy volunteers. An arterial input function was obtained for each subject and a 2-compartment model was used to determine the kinetic parameters of I-123-5IA using data from a 6-h scan. The distribution volume (V-T) (mL/mL), which is related to the number of unoccupied binding sites in the brain, was calculated and values were compared with results of a graphical analysis (Logan plot, V-LG). Results: Analysis of the unmetabolized compound showed a high parent fraction of I-123-5IA in plasma. The results from the 2-compartment model analysis showed high VT values for the thalamus; moderate values for the brain stem, cerebellum, and basal ganglia; and low values for the cortical regions. Good agreement was observed between VT values and results of autoradiographic experiments done in vitro for nAChR density in human brain. A high correlation index was observed between distribution volumes from model and graphical analyses. Conclusion: Our results indicated that I-123-5IA SPECT is suitable for the quantification of nAChRs in human brain.

To ensure that the "agonist-preferring" conformation of the receptor was preferentially labelled in competition binding experiments, saturation analysis was conducted using antagonist and agonist radiolabels at each receptor. Antagonist radiolabels ([H-3]-ketanserin for 5-HT2A receptor and [H-3]-mesulergine for 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor) bound to a larger population of receptors in each preparation than the corresponding agonist radiolabel ([I-125]-DOI for 5-HT2A receptor binding and [H-3]-5-HT for 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor binding). Competition experiments were subsequently conducted against appropriate concentrations of the agonist radiolabels bound to the "agonist-preferring" subset of receptors in each preparation. These studies confirmed that there are a number of highly selective antagonists available to investigate 5-HT2 receptor subtype function (for example, MDL 100907, RS-127445 and RS-102221 for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptors respectively). There remains, however, a lack of highly selective agonists. (-)DOI is potent and moderately selective for 5-HT2A receptors, BW723C86 has poor selectivity for human 5-HT2B receptors, while Org 37684 and VER-3323 display some selectivity for the 5-HT2C receptor. We report for the first time in a single study, the selectivity of numerous serotonergic drugs for 5-HT2 receptors from the same species, in mammalian cell lines and using, exclusively, agonist radiolabels. The results indicate the importance of defining the selectivity of pharmacological tools, which may have been over-estimated in the past, and highlights the need to find more selective agonists to investigate 5-HT2 receptor pharmacology.

J. Med. Chem. 2000, 43, 4768-4780). A derivative having a methyl group at the N-8 pyrazole combined with a 4-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl moiety at N-5 position, displayed a K-i value at the hA(3) receptor of 0.2 nM. We now describe chemically reactive derivatives which act as irreversible inhibitors of this receptor. Electrophilic groups, specifically sulfonyl fluoride and nitrogen mustard (bis-(beta -chloroethyl)amino) moieties, have been incorporated at the 4-position of the aryl urea group. Membranes containing the recombinant hA3 receptor were preincubated with the compounds and washed exhaustively. The loss of ability to bind radioligand following this treatment indicated irreversible binding. The most potent compound in irreversibly binding to the receptor was 14, which contained a sulfonyl fluoride moiety and a propyl group at the N-8 pyrazole nitrogen. The bis-(beta -chloroethyl)amino derivatives displayed a much smaller degree of irreversible binding than the sulfonyl fluoride derivatives. A computer-generated model of the human A(3) receptor was built and analyzed to help interpret these results. The model of the A(3) transmembrane region was derived using primary sequence comparison, secondary structure predictions, and three-dimensional homology building, using the recently published crystal structure of rhodopsin as a template. According to our model, sulfonyl fluoride derivatives could dock within the hypothetical TM binding domain, adopting two different energetically favorable conformations. We have identified two amino acids, Ser247 and Cys251, both in TM6, as potential nucleophilic partners of the irreversible binding to the receptor.

In-vivo NEP and ACE inhibition was studied using in-vitro autoradiography in rats that received oral gemopatrilat (1, 3, 10 mg/kg; n = 4 per dose) and were killed 1 h later, or received oral gemopatrilat (3, 10 mg/kg) and were killed at time points 1, 2, 4, 8, 18, 24 and 48 h (n = 4 per time point). Results Gemopatrilat caused a concentration-dependent displacement of specific radioligands from renal membrane NEP (IC(50)305 +/- 5.4 nmol/l) and ACE (IC50 3.6 +/- 0.02 nmol/l), In the dose-response study gemopatrilat (1,3 and 10 mg/kg) caused significant inhibition of plasma ACE (P < 0.01), and renal ACE and NEP (3, 10 mg/kg, P < 0.01). In the time course experiment, gemopatrilat (10 mg/kg) increased plasma renin activity for 8 h (P < 0.01) and inhibited plasma ACE (P < 0.05), renal NEP (P < 0.01) and renal ACE (P < 0.05) for 48 h. Conclusions Gemopatrilat is a potent in-vitro vasopeptidase inhibitor that also causes prolonged inhibition of circulating and renal ACE and renal NEP after a single oral dose. The data suggest that gemopatrilat may be a useful addition to existing vasopeptidase inhibitors in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.

Not least of these are its dynamic and quantitative capabilities. The recent growth in small animal PET, spurred on by technological developments and an interest in the application of imaging to the field of genomics in mice, has seen impressive improvements in image spatial resolution. The availability of commercial small animal PET scanners has meant a broadening of the user base away from PET development environments and into experimental laboratories. This paper will review these developments and assess the impact on overall data quality. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

To enable structural and functional investigations, MPs need to be extracted from the membrane. This is a critical step that represents the main obstacle for MP biochemistry and structural biology. Here we describe detergent solubilization screening of MPs using dot-blot and Western-blot analyses. Good solubilization conditions are ranked for their best capacity to stabilize MPs using thermal shift assay. The protein functionality is evaluated by radioligand binding (for G-protein-coupled receptor) and ATPase activity (ABC Transporter) and finally the aggregation status as well as protein homogeneity are assessed by Native-polyacrylamide gel, chemical cross-linking, and size exclusion chromatography.

X-ray cocrystal structures of these ligands complexed to both ERalpha and ERbeta are described. We also discuss how molecular modeling was used to take advantage of subtle differences between the two binding cavities in order to optimize selectivity for ERbeta over ER(x. Quantum chemical calculations are utilized to gain insight into the mechanism of selectivity enhancement. Despite only two relatively conservative residue substitutions in the ligand binding pocket, the most selective compounds have greater than 100-fold selectivity for ERbeta relative to ERbeta when measured using a competitive radioligand binding assay.

Expression of each of these proteins is altered in neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we characterize the kinetic behavior of 3 PET radioligands-F-1(8)-BCPP-EF, C-11-SA-4503, and C-11-UCB-J-for the measurement of mitochondrial complex 1, sigma-1 receptor, and synaptic vesicle protein 2A, respectively, and determine appropriate analysis workflows for their application in future studies of the in vivo molecular pathology of these diseases. Methods: Twelve human subjects underwent dynamic PET scans with each radioligand, including associated arterial blood sampling. A range of kinetic models was investigated to identify an optimal kinetic analysis method for each radioligand and a suitable acquisition duration. Results: All 3 radioligands readily entered the brain and yielded heterogeneous uptake consistent with the known distribution of the targets. The optimal models determined for the regional estimates of volume of distribution were multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) and the 2-tissue-compartment model for F-18-BCPP-EF, MA1 for C-11-SA-4503, and both MA1 and the 1-tissue-compartment model for C-11-UCB-J. Acquisition times of 70, 80, and 60 min for F-18-BCPP-EF, C-11-SA-4503, C-11-UCB-J, respectively, provided good estimates of regional volume of distribution values. An effect of age was observed on F-18-BCPP-EF and C-11-UCB-J signal in the caudate. Conclusion: These ligands can be assessed for their potential to stratify patients or monitor the progression of molecular neuropathology in neurodegenerative diseases.

Developments in clinical molecular imaging, including advances in imaging technology and radiotracer design, have afforded the opportunity to identify tissues involved in pain generation based on their pro-nociceptive condition. The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a pro-nociceptive receptor upregulated in painful, inflamed tissues, and it can be imaged using the highly specific radioligand F-18-FTC-146 with PET. Case presentation: A 50-year-old woman with a 7-year history of refractory, left-knee pain of unknown origin was referred to our pain management team. Over the past several years, she had undergone multiple treatments, including a lateral retinacular release, radiofrequency ablation of a peripheral nerve, and physical therapy. While certain treatments provided partial relief, her pain would inevitably return to its original state. Using simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) with the novel radiotracer F-18-FTC-146, imaging showed increased focal uptake of F-18-FTC-146 in the intercondylar notch, corresponding to an irregular but equivocal lesion identified in the simultaneously acquired MRI. These imaging results prompted surgical removal of the lesion, which upon resection was identified as an inflamed, intraarticular synovial lipoma. Removal of the lesion relieved the patient's pain, and to date the pain has not recurred. Conclusion: We present a case of chronic, debilitating knee pain that resolved with surgery following identification of the pathology with a novel clinical molecular imaging approach that detects chronic pain generators at the molecular and cellular level. This approach has the potential to identify and localize pain-associated pathology in a variety of chronic pain syndromes.

Previous PET S1R radiotracers are characterized by slow kinetics or off-target binding that impedes their use in humans. Here, we report the first PET imaging evaluation in rhesus monkeys of 4 F-18-labeled spirocyclic piperidine-based PET radiotracers (F-18-1 to F-18-4). Methods: Baseline scans for the 4 radiotracers were obtained on an adult male rhesus monkey. Blocking scans were obtained with the S1R-selective agonist SA4503 to assess binding specificity of F-18-2 and F-18-4. Arterial input functions were measured, and binding parameters were determined with kinetic modeling analysis. Results: In the rhesus brain, all 4 radiotracers showed high and fast uptake. Tissue activity washout was rapid for F-18-2 and F-18-4, and much slower for F-18-1 and F-18-3, in line with their respective in vitro S1R-binding affinities. Both the 1-tissue-compartment and multilinear analysis-1 kinetic models provided good fits of time-activity curves and reliable estimates of distribution volume. Regional distribution volume values were highest in the cingulate cortex and lowest in the thalamus for all radiotracers. F-18-4 showed greater differential uptake across brain regions and 3-fold-higher binding potential than F-18-2. SA4503 at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg blocked approximately 85% (F-18-2) and 95% (F-18-4) of radiotracer binding. Conclusion: Tracers F-18-2 and F-18-4 displayed high brain uptake and fast tissue kinetics, with F-18-4 having higher specific binding signals than F-18-2 in the same monkey. Taken together, these data indicate that both F-18-2 and F-18-4 possess the requisite kinetic and imaging properties as viable PET tracers for imaging S1R in the human brain.

Methods: Radiosynthesis of [F-18]9 was achieved according to an automated two-step procedure from [F-18]-fluoride. Peripheral and cerebral distributions were determined by ex vivo experiments and by PET imaging in mouse. Radiometabolism studies were performed both in vivo in mice and in vitro in mouse and human liver microsomes. Identification of the major metabolic fragmentations was carried out by UPLC-MS analysis of enzymatic cleavage of non-radioactive ligand 9. Microsomal metabolic degradation of parent JDTic was also achieved for comparison. Results: The radiotracer [F-18]9 was produced after 140 +/- 5 min total synthesis time (2.2 +/- 0.4% not decay corrected radiochemical yield) with a specific activity of 41-89 GBg/mu mol (1.1-2A Ci/mu mol). Peripheral and regional brain distributions of [F-18]9 were consistent with known KOR locations but no significant specific binding in brain was shown. [F-18]9 presented a typical hepatobiliary and renal elimination, and was rapidly metabolized. The in vivo and in vitro radiometabolic profiles of [F-18]9 were similar. Piperidine 12 was identified as the major metabolic fragment of the non-radioactive ligand 9. JDTic 7 was found to be much more stable than 9. Conclusion: Although the newly proposed radioligand [F-18]9 was concluded to be not suitable for KOR PET imaging due to the formation of brain penetrating radiometabolites, our findings highlight the metabolic stability of JDTic and may help in the design of novel JDTic derivatives for in vivo applications.

In the present studies, radioligand binding assays and behavioural approaches were used to characterize the pharmacological profile of Zn at 5-HT(1A)Rs in more detail. The influence of Zn on agonist binding to 5-HT(1A)Rs stably expressed in HEK293 cells was investigated by in vitro radioligand binding methods using the agonist [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT. The in vivo effects of Zn were compared with those of 8-OH-DPAT in hypothermia, lower lip retraction (LLR), 5-HT behavioural syndrome and the forced swim (FST) tests. In the in vitro studies, biphasic effects, which involved allosteric potentiation of agonist binding at sub-micromolar Zn concentrations and inhibition at sub-millimolar Zn concentrations, were found. The in vivo studies showed that Zn did not induce LLR or elements of 5-HT behavioural syndrome but blocked such effects induced by 8-OH-DPAT. Zn decreased body temperature in rats and mice; however, Zn failed to induce hypothermia in the 5-HT1A autoreceptor knockout mice. In the FST, Zn potentiated the effect of 8-OH-DPAT. However, in the FST performed with the 5-HT1A autoreceptor knockout mice, the anti-immobility effect of Zn was partially blocked. Both the binding and behavioural studies suggest a concentration-dependent dual mechanism of Zn action at 5-HT(1A)Rs, with potentiation at low dose and inhibition at high dose. Moreover, the in vivo studies indicate that Zn can modulate both presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A)Rs; however, Zn's effects at presynaptic receptors seem to be more potent.

[F-18]-FEPPA PET scans were acquired on a high-resolution research tomograph in 21 patients with AD (47-81 years) and 21 control subjects (49-82 years). They were analyzed by using a 2-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma input function. Differences in neuroinflammation, indexed as [F-18]-FEPPA binding were compared, adjusting for differences in binding affinity class as determined by a single polymorphism in the TSPO gene (rs6971). In grey matter areas, [F-18]-FEPPA was significantly higher in AD compared with healthy control subjects. Large increases were seen in the hippocampus, prefrontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortex (average Cohen's d = 0.89). Voxel-based analyses confirmed significant clusters of neuroinflammation in the frontal, temporal and parietal cortex in patients with AD. In white matter, [F-18]-FEPPA binding was elevated in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and the cingulum bundle. Higher neuroinflammation in the parietal cortex (r = -0.7, P = 0.005), and posterior limb of the internal capsule (r = -0.8, P = 0.001) was associated with poorer visuospatial function. In addition, a higher [F-18]-FEPPA binding in the posterior limb of the internal capsule was associated with a greater impairment in language ability (r = -0.7, P = 0.004). Elevated neuroinflammation can be detected in AD patients throughout the brain grey and white matter by using [F-18]-FEPPA PET. Our results also suggest that neuroinflammation is associated with some cognitive deficits.	[Suridjan, I.; Voineskos, A. N.; Chow, T.; Rusjan, P. M.; Lobaugh, N.

[C-11](R)-PK11195 binding has been quantified using reference region approaches, with the reference defined anatomically or using unsupervised or supervised clustering algorithms. Kinetic compartment modelling so far has not been presented. In the present test-retest study, we examine the characteristics of [C-11](R)-PK11195 binding in detail, using the classical compartment analysis with a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Methods: [C-11](R)-PK11195 binding was examined in six control subjects at two separate occasions, 6 weeks apart. Results of one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models (1TCM, 2TCM) were compared using the Akaike criteria and F-statistics. The reproducibility of binding potential (BPND) estimates was evaluated by difference in measurements (error in percent) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: [C-11](R)-PK11195 binding could be described by 2TCM which was the preferred model. Measurement error (in percent) indicated good reproducibility in large brain regions (mean error: whole brain 4%, grey matter 5%), but not in smaller subcortical regions (putamen 25%, caudate 55%). The ICC values were moderate to low, highest for the white matter (0.73), whole brain and thalamus (0.57), and cortical grey matter (0.47). Sizeable [C-11](R)-PK11195 BPND could be identified throughout the human brain (range 1.11 to 2.21). Conclusions: High intra-subject variability of [C-11](R)-PK11195 binding limits longitudinal monitoring of TSPO changes. The interpretation of [C-11](R)-PK11195 binding by 2TCM suggests that the presence of specific binding to TSPO cannot be excluded at physiological conditions.

Role of β-adrenoceptors in glucose uptake in astrocytes using β-adrenoceptor knockout mice	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						adrenoceptor; astrocyte; knockout; cAMP; mouse; glucose uptake	DIFFERENT G-PROTEINS; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; BETA-2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; MESSENGER-RNA; BETA(1)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; HUMAN BETA(3)-ADRENOCEPTOR	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE beta(1)-, beta(2)-and beta(3)-adrenoceptors determined by functional, binding and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies are present in chick astrocytes and activation of beta(2)-or beta(3)-adrenoceptors increase glucose uptake. The aims of the present study are to identify which b-adrenoceptor subtypes are present in mouse astrocytes, the signal transduction mechanisms involved and whether b-adrenoceptor stimulation regulates glucose uptake. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Astrocytes were prepared from four mouse strains: FVB/N, DBA/1 crossed with C57BL/6J, beta(3)-adrenoceptor knockout and beta(1)beta(2)-adrenoceptor knockout mice. RT-PCR and radioligand binding studies were used to determine beta-adrenoceptor expression. Glucose uptake and cAMP were assayed to elucidate the signalling pathways involved. KEY RESULTS mRNAs for all three beta-adrenoceptors were identified in astrocytes from wild-type mice. Radioligand binding studies identified that beta(1)-and beta(3)-adrenoceptors were predominant. cAMP studies showed that beta(1)-and beta(2)-adrenoceptors coupled to Gs whereas beta(3)-adrenoceptors coupled to both G(s) and G(i). However, activation of any of the three b-adrenoceptors increased glucose uptake in mouse astrocytes. Interestingly, there was no functional compensation for receptor subtype loss in knockout animals. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This study demonstrates that although beta(1)-adrenoceptors are the predominant b-adrenoceptor in mouse astrocytes and are primarily responsible for cAMP production in response to b-adrenoceptor stimulation, beta(3)-adrenoceptors are also present in mouse astrocytes and activation of beta(2)-and beta(3) -adrenoceptors increases glucose uptake in mouse astrocytes.

This neuropeptide-receptor system is involved in pain regulation, tolerance to and dependence on opiates as well as many other physiological and pathophysiological events. The role and mechanisms of nociceptin in pathological conditions is not clearly known yet. In an attempt to have a radiopharmaceutical labeled either with Tc-99m or In-111, we incorporated diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) as chelator into the structure of [Arg(14), Lys(15)]nociceptin(1- 17)-NH2 at the e-amino group of Lys(15). Such a radiopeptide may be useful in imaging for diagnostical purposes. Preparation of the peptide ligands was carried out by solid phase synthesis. Two peptides containing DTPA were obtained and purified. The products were [Arg(14), Lys(DTPA)(15)]nociceptin(1-17)-NH2 and its cross-linked dimer on the basis of mass spectrometric analysis. In In-115(3+) binding experiments the conjugates exhibited preserved indium ion chelating properties, indicating the potential use of radiolabeled DTPA-nociceptin derivatives as radiopharmaceutical. Biological properties of these compounds were studied in rat brain membrane preparations by radioligand binding, functional biochemical [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays and mouse vas deferens (MVD) bioassay. Besides the similar in vitro binding characteristics to nociceptin receptor, both of the DTPA-chelated compounds were more potent and efficient than nociceptin in functional biochemical and mouse vas deferens bioassays. Our further aim is to radiolabel these compounds in order to get a radiopharmaceutical which can be used diagnostically. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Because diminished turnover may result from CNS folate depletion, the authors studied transport of folate across the blood-brain barrier. Methods: In four patients with Rett syndrome, the authors measured CSF values of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5MTHF), biogenic monoamine end-metabolites, and pterins together with serum and red blood cell folate. In CSF, the overall folate binding capacity by the two soluble folate-binding proteins FBP1 and FBP2 (sFBP) was measured using a radioligand binding method for H-3-labeled folate. A specific immunoreactive test ( ELISA) detected sFBP1, which normally contributes to 30 to 35% of the total folate binding capacity. Genetic analysis included DNA sequencing of the MECP2, FBP1, and FBP2 genes. Empirical treatment with oral folinic acid was evaluated. Results: Two patients without and two with mutations of the MECP2 gene had normal values for red blood cell folate, serum folate, homocysteine, and methionine. In CSF, all patients had low values for 5MTHF, neopterin, and the serotonin end-metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Genetic analysis of FBP1 and FBP2 genes had normal results. Compared to controls, patients with Rett syndrome had normal immunoreactive sFBP1 in CSF, whereas the total folate binding capacity was disproportionately lowered. Empirical treatment with oral folinic acid normalized 5-MHTF and 5-HIAA levels in CSF, and led to partial clinical improvement. Conclusion: Irrespective of the MECP2 genotype, 5MTHF transfer to the CNS is reduced in Rett syndrome. Folinic acid supplementation restores 5MTHF levels and serotoninergic turnover. The lowered folate binding capacity of FBP is not explained by a defect of the FBP1 or FBP2 gene, but most likely occurs as a secondary phenomenon in Rett syndrome.

No specific binding sites could be detected in HEK293 cells transfected with the rat Y-2 or Y-5 receptor cDNA demonstrating the absence of significant affinity of GR231118 for these two receptor classes. 4 Competition binding experiments revealed that specific [I-125]-GR231118 binding in rat brain homogenates is most similar to that observed in HEK293 cells transfected with the rat Y-1, but not rat Y-4, receptor cDNA. 5 Autoradiographic studies demonstrated that [I-125]-GR231118 binding sites were fully inhibited by the Y-1 antagonist BIBO3304 in most areas of the rat brain. Interestingly, high percentage of [I-125]-GR231118/BIBO3304-insensitive binding sites were detected in few areas. These [I-125]-GR231118/BIBO3304-insensitive binding sites likely represent labelling to the Y-4 receptor subtype. 6 In summary, [I-125]-GR231118 is a new radiolabelled probe to investigate the Y-1 and Y-4 receptors; its major advantage being its high affinity. Using highly selective Y-1 antagonists such as BIBO3304 or BIBP3226 it is possible to block the binding of [I-125]-GR231118 to the Y-1 receptor allowing for the characterization and visualization of the purported Y-4 subtype.

Despite routine performance in patients who had received Ra-223, it is not clear whether disease sites refractory to alpha radiation can be effectively treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617. Secondly, it remains to be elucidated if therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 can be safely performed shortly after Ra-223, bearing in mind the myelotoxic potential of both treatments. The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate safety and efficacy of Lu-177-PSMA-617 within less than 8 weeks after failing Ra-223. Radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 shortly after failing Ra-223 is effective and can result in long-standing disease control even in patients with disseminated or diffuse bone involvement. Patients with oligo- and multifocal bone metastases show significantly longer overall survival with lower risk of significant hematotoxicity compared to patients with disseminated/diffuse involvement. Bone-seeking (223)Radium-dichloride (Ra-223) is an established treatment prolonging survival and reducing morbidity in selected patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with skeletal involvement. Radioligand therapy with (177)Lutetium-PSMA-617 (Lu-177-PSMA-617) has been increasingly implemented in patients with mCRPC failing conventional treatment options. In this study, the safety and efficacy of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in patients with progressive bone involvement under treatment with Ra-223 was assessed. Twenty-eight men (median age 73 years, range 63-89 years) with progressive mCRPC, who started Lu-177-PSMA-617 within 8 weeks after the last Ra-223 administration, received a median of 4 (IQR 3-6) and a total of 120 cycles of Ra-223 and a median of 4 (IQR 2-7) cycles Lu-177-PSMA-617 with a mean treatment activity of 6.5 +/- 1.2 GBq per cycle, reaching a mean cumulative activity of 30.7 +/- 23.4 GBq. A PSA response (>= 50% PSA decline 12 weeks after the first Lu-177-PSMA-617 cycle) was observed in 18/28 (64.3%) patients and imaging-based partial remission (PR) was observed in 11/28 (39.3%) patients. Median imaging-based progression-free survival (PFS) was 10 (95% CI, 6-14) months and median overall survival (OS) was 18 (95% CI, 14-22) months. Patients with low bone tumor burden (2-20 lesions) had a significantly longer OS (28 vs. 14 months, p < 0.045) compared to patients with a high tumor burden (>20 lesions). Grade >= 3 hematological toxicity was observed in six patients after their last treatment cycle with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in 5/28 (17.9%), 4/28 (14.3%) and 6/28 (21.4%) patients, respectively. In progressive bone-metastatic mCRPC patients, prompt initiation of Lu-177-PSMA-617 after failing Ra-223 is effective with an acceptable toxicity profile.

Interaction in the recognition of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a typical bivalent ET receptor-ligand, between ETA and ETB receptors was investigated in the rat anterior pituitary gland, using our quantitative receptor autoradiographic method with tissue sections preserving the cell-membrane structure and ET receptor-related compounds. 2. In saturation binding studies with increasing concentrations (0.77-200 pM) of I-125-ET-1 (nonselective bivalent radioligand), I-125-ET-1 binding to the rat anterior pituitary gland was saturable and single with a K-D of 71 pM and a B-max of 120 fmol mg(-1). When 1.0 muM BQ-123 (ETA antagonist) was added to the incubation buffer, binding parameters were 8.3 pM of K-D and 8.0 fmol mg(-1) of B-max, whereas 10 nM sarafotoxin S6c (ETB agonist) exerted little change in these binding parameters (K-D, 72 pM; B-max, 110 fmol mg(-1)). 3. Competition binding studies with a fixed amount (3.8 pM) of I-125-ET-1 revealed that when 1.0 muM BQ-123 was present in the incubation buffer, ETB receptor-related compounds such as sarafotoxin S6c, ET-3, IRL1620 (ETB agonist), and BQ-788 (ETB antagonist) competitively inhibited I-125-ET-1 binding with K(i)s of 140, 18, 350 pM, and 14 nM, respectively, however, these compounds were not significant competitors for I-125-ET-1 binding in the case of absence of BQ-123. 4. In cold-ligand saturation studies with a fixed amount (390 pM) of I-125-IRL 1620 (ETB radioligand), IRL1620 bound to a single population of the ETB receptor, and no change was observed in binding characteristics in the presence of 1.0 muM BQ-123. I-125-IRL1620 binding was competitively inhibited by ET-1 and ET-3 in the absence of BQ-123, with K(i)s of 20 and 29 pM, respectively, the affinities being much the same as those of 29 nM, in the presence of 1.0 muM BQ-123. 5. Two nonbivalent ETA antagonists, BQ-123 and PD151242, were highly sensitive and full competitors for (1)25I-ET-1 binding (5.0 pM), in the presence of 10 nM sarafotoxin S6c. 6. Taken together with the present finding that mRNAs encoding the rat ETA and the ETB receptors are expressed in the anterior pituitary gland, we tentatively conclude that although there are ETA and ETB receptors with a functional binding capability for ET receptor-ligands, the ETB receptor does not independently recognize ET-1 without the aid of the ETA receptor. If this thesis is tenable, then ET-1 can bridge between the two receptors to form an ETA-ETB receptor heterodimer.

RO6807936 as a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for in vitro and in vivo visualization and quantification of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) in the rodent and baboon brain	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease (AD); autoradiography; BACE1; positron emission tomography (PET)	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SECRETASE BACE1; RADIOLIGAND; BINDING; INHIBITOR; DISCOVERY; PROGRESS; POTENT; ASSAY	The beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) is responsible for initiating the generation of beta-amyloid, the major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The purpose of this study was to develop a specific BACE1 radioligand for visualization of the distribution pattern and quantification of the BACE1 protein in the rodent and monkey brain both in vitro by autoradiography and in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). The BACE1 inhibitor RO6807936 originating from an in-house chemical drug optimization program was selected based on its PET tracer-like physicochemical properties and a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. Saturation binding analysis of [H-3]RO6807936 revealed specific and high-affinity binding (K-D = 2.9 nM) and a low B-max value (4.3 nM) of the BACE1 protein in native rat brain membranes. [H-3]RO6807936 binding showed a ubiquitous distribution on rat brain slices in vitro with higher levels in the CA3 pyramidal cell layer and the granule cell layer of the hippocampus. In a next step, RO6807936 was successfully radiolabeled with carbon-11 and showed acceptable uptake in the baboon brain as well as a widespread and rather homogeneous distribution consistent with rodent data. In vivo blockade studies with a specific BACE1 inhibitor reduced uptake of the tracer to homogenous levels across brain regions and demonstrated specificity of the signal. Our data warrant further profiling of this PET tracer candidate in humans to investigate BACE1 expression in normal individuals and those with AD and as an imaging biomarker for target occupancy studies in clinical drug trials.

The metabolising enzymes associated with this biotransformation remain unknown. This study aimed to determine if AMB-FUBINACA metabolism could be reduced in the presence of carboxylesterase (CES) inhibitors and recreational drugs commonly consumed with it. The affinity and activity of the AMB-FUBINACA acid metabolite at the cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1) was investigated to determine the activity of the metabolite. Methods The effect of CES1 and CES2 inhibitors, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC) on AMB-FUBINACA metabolism were determined using both human liver microsomes (HLM) and recombinant carboxylesterases. Radioligand binding and cAMP assays comparing AMB-FUBINACA and AMB-FUBINACA acid were carried out in HEK293 cells expressing human CB1. Results AMB-FUBINACA was rapidly metabolised by HLM in the presence and absence of NADPH. Additionally, CES1 and CES2 inhibitors both significantly reduced AMB-FUBINACA metabolism. Furthermore, digitonin (100 mu M) significantly inhibited CES1-mediated metabolism of AMB-FUBINACA by similar to 56%, while the effects elicited by Delta(9)-THC were not statistically significant. AMB-FUBINACA acid produced only 26% radioligand displacement consistent with low affinity binding. In cAMP assays, the potency of AMB-FUBINACA was similar to 3000-fold greater at CB1 as compared to the acid metabolite. Conclusions CES1A1 was identified as the main hepatic enzyme responsible for the metabolism of AMB-FUBINACA to its less potent carboxylic acid metabolite. This biotransformation was significantly inhibited by digitonin. Since other xenobiotics may also inhibit similar SCRA metabolic pathways, understanding these interactions may elucidate why some users experience high levels of harm following SCRA use.

Design and pharmacological profile of a novel covalent partial agonist for the adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptors; Adenosine A(1) receptor; Covalent ligand; Partial agonist; Radioligand binding; Label-free assay	ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; ANTAGONIST BINDING; WILD-TYPE; LIGAND; KINETICS; CELLS; ASSAY; THERMODYNAMICS; DERIVATIVES; RESIDUES	Partial agonists for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) provide opportunities for novel pharmacotherapies with enhanced on-target safety compared to full agonists. For the human adenosine A(1) receptor (hA(1)AR) this has led to the discovery of capadenoson, which has been in phase IIa clinical trials for heart failure. Accordingly, the design and profiling of novel hA(1)AR partial agonists has become an important research focus. In this study, we report on LUF7746, a capadenoson derivative bearing an electrophilic fluorosulfonyl moiety, as an irreversibly binding hA(1)AR modulator. Meanwhile, a nonreactive ligand bearing a methylsulfonyl moiety, LUF7747, was designed as a control probe in our study. In a radioligand binding assay, LUF7746's apparent affinity increased to nanomolar range with longer pre-incubation time, suggesting an increasing level of covalent binding over time. Moreover, compared to the reference full agonist CPA, LUF7746 was a partial agonist in a hA(1)AR-mediated G protein activation assay and resistant to blockade with an antagonist/inverse agonist. An in silico structure-based docking study combined with site-directed mutagenesis of the hA(1)AR demonstrated that amino acid Y2717.36 was the primary anchor point for the covalent interaction. Additionally, a label-free whole-cell assay was set up to identify LUF7746's irreversible activation of an A(1) receptor-mediated cell morphological response. These results led us to conclude that LUF7746 is a novel covalent hA(1)AR partial agonist and a valuable chemical probe for further mapping the receptor activation process. It may also serve as a prototype for a therapeutic approach in which a covalent partial agonist may cause less on-target side effects, conferring enhanced safety compared to a full agonist.

Pharmacological characterisation of a tool αvβ1 integrin small molecule RGD-mimetic inhibitor	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						alpha v beta 1 integrin; Fibrosis; Radioligand binding; Integrin selectivity; Pharmacokinetics	INDUCED PULMONARY FIBROSIS; MOUTH-DISEASE-VIRUS; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; BETA; ALPHA(V)BETA(3); FIBROBLASTS; FAILURE; BINDING; CANCER	Compound 8 is a selective alpha v beta 1 small molecule inhibitor that has been used in pre-clinical studies to identify and characterise the alpha v beta 1 integrin as a potential target in fibrotic disease. In this study we further investigated the selectivity and pharmacokinetics of compound 8 to determine a link between the levels of alpha v beta 1 engagement required to achieve in vivo pharmacodynamic efficacy. The selectivity of compound 8 for the arginyl-glycinyl-aspartic acid and beta 1 integrins was measured using purified integrin protein preparations in radioligand binding studies with both labelled ([H-3]compound 8) and unlabelled versions. The pharmacokinetic profile of compound 8 was completed in in vitro blood protein binding assays and in in vivo studies using male C57BL/6 mouse following i.v. dosing. The high selectivity of compound 8 for alpha v beta 1 over the other alpha v integrins was confirmed, however a reduced selectivity was demonstrated for the beta 1 integrin family, with high affinity observed for alpha 4 beta 1 (comparable to alpha v beta 1), moderate affinity for alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1 and alpha 8 beta 1, and low affinity for alpha 5 beta 1 and alpha 9 beta 1. Compound 8 was shown to be cleared quickly from the blood with a short half-life of 0.5 h. In conclusion, the data in this study suggest that compound 8 has the potential to engage a number of integrins in vivo beyond alpha v beta 1, that raises a degree of uncertainty regarding its mechanism of action in models of fibrotic disease.

J	Reubi, JC; Waser, B				Reubi, Jean Claude; Waser, Beatrice			Triple-Peptide Receptor Targeting In Vitro Allows Detection of All Tested Gut and Bronchial NETs	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						multireceptor imaging; neuroendocrine tumors; somatostatin receptors; GLP-1 receptors; incretin receptors	GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; INSULINOMAS; SCINTIGRAPHY; EXPRESSION; THERAPY	A high proportion of gut and bronchial neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) overexpresses somatostatin receptors, especially the sst(2) subtype. It has also recently been observed that incretin receptors, namely glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptors, can be overexpressed in gut and bronchial NETs. However, because not all tumors can express these receptors in sufficient amounts, in vivo imaging with a single radioligand may not always be successful. We therefore evaluated with in vitro methods whether a cocktail of radioligands targeting these 3 receptors would improve tumor labeling. Methods: In vitro receptor autoradiography was performed on 55 NETs, comparing in each successive section of tumor the binding with a single radioligand, either I-125-Tyr(3)-octreotide, I-125-GLP-1(7-36)amide, or I-125-GIP(1-30), with the binding using a cocktail of all 3 radioligands, given concomitantly under identical experimental conditions. Results: Using the cocktail of radioligands, all tumors without exception showed moderate to very high binding, with a receptor density corresponding to 1,000-10,000 dpm/mg of tissue; conversely, single-ligand binding, although identifying most tumors as receptor-positive, failed to detect receptors or measured only a low density of receptors below 1,000 dpm/mg in a significant number of tumors. In addition, the cocktail of radioligands always provided a homogeneous labeling of the whole tumor, whereas single radioligands occasionally showed heterogeneous labeling. Conclusion: The study suggests that the use of a cocktail of 3 radioligands binding to somatostatin receptors, GLP-1 receptors, and GIP receptors would allow detecting virtually all NETs and labeling them homogeneously in vivo, representing a significant improvement for imaging and therapy in NETs.

The concept of MS binding assays based on mass spectrometric quantification of a nonlabeled marker recently introduced by us represents a promising alternative to conventional radioligand binding without the drawbacks inherently connected with radioisotope labeling. For high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), a 20x2-mm RP-18 column with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and ammonium bicarbonate buffer (5 mmol L-1, pH 9.5) at a ratio of 80: 20 (v/v) and a flow rate of 800 mu L min(-1) in an isocratic mode were used, resulting in a chromatographic cycle time of 60 s. Employing [H-2(5)] fluoxetine as internal standard enabled ESI-MS/MS quantification of (S)-fluoxetine between 3 nmol L-1 and 50 pmol L-1 (LLOQ) in matrix obtained from binding experiments without the need of any sample preparation. Validation of the method showed that linearity, intra-, and inter-batch accuracy as well as precision meet the requirements of the FDA guidance for bioanalytical method validation. Considering sensitivity and speed, the established method is clearly superior to those published for biological matrices so far. Furthermore, the method was transferred to other RP-18 columns of different lengths and respective validation experiments demonstrated its versatility and chromatographic robustness. Finally, the newly developed method was successfully applied to MS binding assays for hSERT. The affinity determined for (S)-fluoxetine in saturation experiments was in good agreement with literature data obtained in respective radioligand binding assays.

Pre-clinical validation of a novel alpha-7 nicotinic receptor radiotracer, [<SUP>3</SUP>H]AZ11637326: Target localization, biodistribution and ligand occupancy in the rat brain	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						[H-3]AZ11637326; AR-R17779; Alpha-7 neuronal nicotinic receptor; In vivo receptor occupancy; Autoradiography; Rat brain; Ligand binding	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; BINDING-SITES; IN-VITRO; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MESSENGER-RNA; AGONIST; RADIOLIGAND; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INFLAMMATION	The alpha-7 neuronal nicotinic receptor is a novel pharmacological target for psychiatric and cognitive disorders. Selective radiotracer tools for pre-clinical receptor occupancy can facilitate the interpretation of the biological actions of small molecules at a target receptor. We discovered a high affinity nicotinic alpha-7 subtype-selective ligand, AZ11637326, with physical chemical and pharmacokinetic properties suitable for an in vivo radioligand tool. [H-3]AZ11637326 synthesis by tritiodehalogenation of the corresponding tribromide precursor yielded a high specific activity radiotracer with high affinity alpha-7 receptor binding in the rat hippocampus determined by autoradiography (Kd = 0.2 nM). When [H-3] AZ11637326 was administered to rats by intravenous bolus, rapid uptake was measured in the brain followed by a 3-4 fold greater specific binding in regions containing the alpha-7 receptor (frontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus and midbrain) when compared to non-target regions (striatum and cerebellum). Systemic administration of the high affinity alpha-7 receptor antagonist, methyllycaconitine (MLA), or pretreatment with alpha-7 selective agonists (AR-R17779, PyrQTC, DBCO-4-POM, and DBCO-3-POM) significantly blocked the alpha-7 specific binding of [H-3]AZ11637326 in the rat brain. The rank order of ligand ED50 values for in vivo alpha-7 receptor occupancy in rat hippocampus was: DBCO-4-POM > DBC0-3-POM similar to MLA > PyrQTC > AR-R17779. The occupancy affinity shift was consistent with in vitro binding affinity in autoradiography. Our studies established the optimal conditions for [H-3] AZ11637326 in vivo specific binding in the rat brain and support the use of [H-3]AZ11637326 as a preclinical tool for assessment of novel alpha-7 compounds in drug discovery.

In vitro autoradiography on rat brain slices resulted in a heterogeneous and displaceable binding to mGluR5-rich brain regions. [F-18]-FDEGPECO showed high stability in rat plasma and brain homogenate as well as in human plasma and microsomes. Good blood-brain barrier passage was predicted from an in vitro transport assay with P-glycoprotein-transfectecl hMDR1-MDCK cells. In vivo PET imaging on rats revealed specific uptake of radioactivity in the mGluR5-rich brain regions such as hippocampus, striatum and cortex while the cerebellum, a region with low mGluR5-expression, showed negligible uptake. Blockade experiments by co-injection of [F-18]-FDEGPECO and M-MPEP (6 mg/kg), an antagonist for mGluR5, reduced the level of radioactivity in mGluR5-regions to that of the cerebellum, pointing to an effective blockade of specifically bound [F-18]-FDEGPECO. Postmortem biodistribution studies at 15 min p.i. confirmed the distribution pattern observed in PET. HPLC analysis of rat brain extracts indicated that 98.5% and 91% of the total radioactivity were parent compound at 5 min and 17 min p.i., respectively. Taken together, the high affinity and the high in vivo specificity of[F-18]-FDEGPECO for mGluR5 in the rat brain as well as the lack of in vivo defluorination make this new [F-18]-labeled ABP688 derivative a suitable ligand for the preclinical PET imaging of mGluR5. These favorable characteristics warrant further evaluation in humans. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: Labelling of Demotate 2 with 99mTc was performed at room temperature using SnCl2 as reductant in the presence of citrate at alkaline pH. Radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and HPLC methods. Peptide conjugate affinities for sst(2) were determined by receptor autoradiography on rat brain cortex sections using [DOTA(0),I-125-Tyr(3)] octreotate as the radioligand. The affinity profile of Demotate 2 for human sst(1)-sst(5) was studied by receptor autoradiography in cell preparations using the universal somatostatin radioligand [I-125][Leu(8),(D) Trp(22), Tyr(25)] somatostatin-28. The internalisation rates of [Tc-99m] Demotate 2 and [In-111] DOTA-tate were compared in sst(2)-positive and - negative control cell lines. Biodistribution of radiopeptides was studied in male Lewis rats bearing CA20948 tumours. Results: Peptide conjugates showed selectivity and a high affinity binding for sst(2) ( Demotate 2 IC50 = 3.2 nM and DOTA-tate IC50 = 5.4 nM). [Tc-99m] Demotate 2, like [In-111] DOTA-tate, internalised rapidly in all sst(2)-positive cells tested, but not in sst(2)-negative control cells. After injection in CA20948 tumour-bearing rats both radiopeptides showed high and specific uptake in the sst(2)-positive organs and in the implanted tumour and rapid excretion from non-target tissues via the kidneys. Conclusion: [Tc-99m] Demotate 2, similarly to the known sst(2)-targeting agent [In-111] DOTA-tate, showed promising biological qualities for application in the scintigraphy of sst(2)-positive tumours.

They were also proposed for the treatment of several central nervous system disorders. In brain, these compounds bind both neuronal and vascular Ca2+ channels, but no studies have evaluated comparatively their density at neuronal and vascular level. This study has analyzed the pharmacological profile and the anatomical localization of L-type Ca2+ channels in rat frontal cortex, hippocampus and in forebrain pial and intracerebral arteries by radioligand binding assay and high resolution light microscope autoradiography. The DHP derivative [H-3]nicardipine was used as a radioligand. Binding of [H-3]nicardipine was consistent with the labeling of L-type Ca2+ channels. In frontal cortex, the highest density of binding sites was found in nerve cell body region, followed by the neuropil and the wall of intracerebral arteries. In hippocampus, the density of binding sites was higher in the nerve cell body region than in the neuropil of CA1, CA3, and CA4 subfields. In the dentate gyrus, a higher density of silver grains was developed in neuropil than in nerve cell body of granule neurons. With the exception of dentate gyrus, neuronal binding sites were more expressed than vascular binding sites in the hippocampus. In pial arteries [H-3]nicardipine binding density decreased concomitant with the reduction of vessel diameter, whereas in intracerebral arteries [H-3]nicardipine binding density displayed an opposite pattern. The above findings indicate that in brain the density of neuronal L-type Ca2+ channels was significantly higher than that of vascular ones. This may account for more pronounced neuronal than vascular effects after pharmacological manipulation of cerebral Ca2+ channels.

This paper describes the pharmacological and biochemical characterization of the tritiated form of a new potent A(3) adenosine receptor antagonist, the pyrazolo triazolo pyrimidine derivative [H-3]5N-(4-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl)amino-8-propyl-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine ([H-3]MRE 3008F20). [H-3]MRE 3008F20 bound specifically to the human adenosine A(3) receptor expressed in CHO cells (hA(3) CHO), and saturation analysis revealed a single high affinity binding site, K-D = 0.80 +/- 0.06 nM, with a B-max = 300 +/- 33 fmol/mg protein. This new ligand displayed high selectivity (1294-, 165-, and 2471-fold) in binding assay to human A(3) versus A(1), A(2A), and A(2B) receptors, respectively, and binds to the rat A(3) receptors with a K-i > 10 mu M. The pharmacological profile of [H-3]MRE 3008F20 binding to hA(3)CHO cells was evaluated using known adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists with a rank order of potency consistent with that typically found for interactions with the A(3) adenosine receptors. In the adenylyl cyclase assay the same compounds exhibited a rank order of potency identical with that observed in binding experiments. Thermodynamic data indicated that [H-3]MRE 3008F20 binding to hA(3)CHO is entropy- and enthalpy-driven in agreement with the typical behavior of other adenosine antagonists to A(1) and A(2A) receptors. These results show that [H-3]MRE 3008F20 is the first antagonist radioligand with high affinity and selectivity for the human A(3) adenosine receptor and may be used to investigate the physiopathological role of A(3) adenosine receptors.

A combination of molecular dynamics and NMR spectroscopy was used to examine potential polymer systems, in particular with the functional monomers methacrylic acid and 2-acrylamidopyridine. The synthesis of copolymers of ethylene dimethacrylate and one or both of these functional monomers was performed. A combination of radioligand binding studies and surface area analyses demonstrated the presence of selectivity in polymers prepared using methacrylic acid as the functional monomer. This was predicted by the molecular dynamics studies showing the power of this methodology as a prognostic tool for predicting the behavior of molecularly imprinted polymers.

Whatever these mechanisms are, the vessel contraction is ultimately induced by an increase of free intracellular Ca2+ in the arterial wall. In this study, we investigated the effect on cerebral blood flow of a new dihydropyridine derivative Ca-channel blocker Niguldipine, in an rabbit experimental cerebral vasospasm model. The cerebral blood flow was significantly decreased in the saline treatment group when compared with control group. Niguldipine pretreatment caused a significant increase in cerebral blood flow.

Primary endpoint was RECIST response after RLT. Secondary endpoints included PET response (PERCIST), overall survival (OS), dosimetry, and safety of FAP-RLT.Results: Among 119 screened patients, 21 (18%) were found eligible [n = 16/3/1/1 sarcoma/pancreatic cancer/prostate/gastric cancer; 38% Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) >= 2] and received 47 90Y-FAPI-46-RLT cycles; 16 of 21 (76%) patients underwent repeat RLT. By RECIST, disease control was confirmed in 8 of 21 patients [38%; 8/16 (50%) of evaluable patients). There was one partial response (PR) and seven stable diseases after RLT. Disease control was associated with prolonged OS (P = 0.013). PERCIST response was noted in 8 of 21 patients [38%; 8/15 (53%) of evaluable patients]. Dosimetry was acquired in 19 (90%) patients. Mean absorbed dose was 0.53 Gy/GBq in kidney, 0.04 Gy/GBq in bone marrow, and <0.14 Gy/GBq in liver and lung. Treatment -related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were observed in 8 (38%) patients with thrombocytopenia (n = 6) and anemia (n = 6) being most prevalent.Conclusions: 90Y-FAPI-46-RLT was safe and led to RECIST PR in one case as well as stable disease in about one third of patients with initially progressive sarcomas, pancreatic cancer, and other cancers. Discontinuation after the first cycle and a low rate of PR requires future improvement of FAP-RLT.

Matched-pair analysis of [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA I&T and [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						PSMA I&T; PSMA-617; Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Prostate cancer; Radioligand therapy; Matched pair	MITOXANTRONE PLUS PREDNISONE; OPEN-LABEL; CABAZITAXEL	Background Labelled with lutetium-177, the urea-based small molecules PSMA I&T and PSMA-617 are the two agents most frequently used for radioligand therapy (RLT) in patients with advanced metastatic castration-resistant and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expressing prostate cancer (mCRPC). In this matched-pair analysis, we aimed to compare the toxicity and efficacy of both agents for PSMA-directed RLT. Materials and methods A total of 110 mCRPC patients from two centres were accrued, 55 individuals treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T, and a matched cohort of 55 patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Matching criteria included age at the first cycle, Gleason score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values, and previous taxane-based chemotherapy. Using common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE v. 5.0), toxicity profiles were investigated (including bone marrow and renal toxicity). Overall survival (OS) between both groups was compared. Results Toxicity assessment revealed grade III anaemia in a single patient (1.8%) for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T and five (9.1%) for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. In addition, one (1.9%) grade III thrombopenia for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 was recorded. Apart from that, no other grade III/IV toxicities were present. A median OS of 12 months for patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T did not differ significantly when compared to patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (median OS, 13 months; P = 0.89). Conclusion In this matched-pair analysis of patients receiving one of the two agents most frequently applied for PSMA RLT, the rate of clinically relevant toxicities was low for both compounds. In addition, no relevant differences for OS were observed.

Lu-177-PSMA I&T is currently used for radioligand therapy (RLT) of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in several centers in Europe. Background: Dosimetry is mandatory according to EU guidelines, although routine methods for dosimetry, i.e., absorbed radiation dose calculations for radiopharmaceuticals, are missing. Methods: We created a model of dosimetric analysis utilizing voxel-based dosimetry and intra-lesion radiomics to assess their practicality in routine dosimetry. Results: As an example for the model, our patient with mCRPC had excellent therapy response; quantitatively more than 97% of the metastatic tumor burden in local and distant lymph nodes and skeleton was destroyed by four cycles of RLT. The absorbed radiation doses in metastases decreased towards later cycles of RLT. Besides the change of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) concentration and absorbed doses in the tumor, further response to RLT could be predicted from biomarker changes, such as LDH and PSA. Conclusions: Individual dosimetry is needed to understand large variations in tumor doses and mixed responses; for that purpose, routine tools should be developed. The Dosimetry Research Tool (DRT) fluently performed automated organ delineation and absorbed radiation dose calculations in normal organs, and the results in our patient were in good concordance with the published studies on Lu-177-PSMA dosimetry. At the same time, we experienced considerable challenges in voxel-based dosimetry of tumor lesions. Measurements of Lu-177-PSMA activity concentrations instead of absorbed radiation dose calculations could make routine dosimetry more flexible. The first cycle of RLT seems to have quantitatively the biggest impact on the therapy effect. Radiomics analyses could probably aid in the treatment optimization, but it should be tested in large patient populations.

In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of a putative ap-GnRH receptor (ap-GnRHR) and functionally authenticated this receptor as a bona fide ap-GnRHR. This receptor contains two potential translation start sites, each accompanied by a Kozak sequence, suggesting the translation of a long and a short form of the receptor is possible. The putative ap-GnRHR maintains the conserved structural motifs of GnRHR-like receptors and shares 45% sequence identity with the octopus GnRHR. The expression of the putative ap-GnRHR short form is ubiquitous in all tissues examined, whereas the long form is only expressed in parts of the central nervous system, osphradium, small hermaphroditic duct, and ovotestis. The cDNA encoding the long or the short receptor was transfected into the Drosophila S2 cell line and subject to a radioreceptor assay using I-125-labeled ap-GnRH as the radioligand. Further, the transfected cells were treated with various concentrations of ap-GnRH and measured for the accumulation of cAMP and inositol monophosphate (IP1). Radioreceptor assay revealed that only the long receptor bound specifically to the radioligand. Further, only the long receptor responded to ap-GnRH with an increased accumulation of IP1, but not cAMP. Our studies show that despite the more prevalent expression of the short receptor, only the long receptor is the functional ap-GnRHR. Importantly, this is only the second report on the authentication of a protostome GnRHR, and based on the function and the phylogenetic grouping of ap-GnRHR, we suggest that this receptor is more similar to protostome corazonin receptors than chordate GnRHRs.

In order to fulfill the demand of clinical studies, we have developed a fully automated one-pot two-step synthesis of this potent SERT imaging agent. Methods: The 4-[F-18]-ADAM (2) was synthesized using a commercially available GE TRACERIab FN module. Briefly, the precursor, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2,4-dinitrophenylthio) benzylamine (1) in DMSO was reacted with K[F-18]iK(2.22) in a glassy carbon reaction vessel at 120 degrees C for 7.5 min followed by reduction of the intermediate with NaBH4/Cu(OAc)(2) in EtOH in, the same vessel at 80 degrees C for 20 min. The reaction mixture was then purified with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and solid phase extraction (SPE) to give (2). The quality of (2) synthesized by this method was verified by HPLC and TLC as compared to its authentic sample synthesized by two-pot two-step method. Results: Using this automated one-pot two-step method, the radiochemical yield (RCY) of (2) was 2.5 +/- 0.8% (n=12, EOS) in a synthesis time of 100 +/- 6 min from EOB with a specific activity of 4.4 +/- 1.9 Ci/mu mol (n=12, EOS). Radioligand (2) was stable over 4 h at room temperature. Conclusions: This fully automated one-pot two-step synthetic method using a commercially available GE TRACERIab FN module could simplify the synthesis of 4-[F-18]-ADAM (2) and fulfill its demand for both animal and human studies, especially for study sites without a cyclotron.

Numerous neuroimaging studies have consistently demonstrated an age-related decrease in DAT density in normal human brain. However, the precise degree of the regional decline is not yet clear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the normal aging process on DAT densities in human-specific brain regions including the substantia nigra and thalamus using positron emission tomography (PET) with [F-18]FE-PE2I, a new PET radioligand with high affinity and selectivity for DAT. Thirty-six healthy volunteers ranging in age from 22 to 80 years were scanned with PET employing [F-18]FE-PE2I for measuring DAT densities. Region of interest (ROI)-based analysis was used, and ROIs were manually defined for the caudate, putamen, substantia nigra, thalamus, and cerebellar cortex. DAT binding was quantified using a simplified reference tissue model, and the cerebellum was used as reference region. Estimations of binding potential in the caudate, putamen, substantia nigra, and thalamus were individually regressed according to age using simple regression analysis. Estimates of DAT loss per decade were obtained using the values from the regression slopes. There were 7.6, 7.7, and 3.4 % per-decade declines in DAT in the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra, respectively. By contrast, there was no age-related decline of DAT in the thalamus. [F-18]FE-PE2I allowed reliable quantification of DAT, not only in the caudate and putamen but also in the substantia nigra. From the results, we demonstrated the age-related decline in the caudate and putamen as reported in previous studies, and additionally for those in the substantia nigra for the first time.

The present study aimed to evaluate the affinity of the bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonist MEN16132 for the rabbit and pig B-2 receptor, and radioligand binding experiments using [H-3]bradykinin and membranes of rabbit and pig ileum smooth muscle were conducted. The [H-3]bradykinin binding was characterized by homologous displacement curves indicating K-d values of 0.65 and 0.33 nM in rabbit and pig, respectively. The B-2 receptor specificity of [H-3]bradykinin binding was shown by the low affinity (>mu M) displayed by agonists ([desArg(9)]bradykinin and Lys[desArg(9)]bradykinin) and antagonists [Leu(8),desArg(9)]bradykinin and Lys[Leu(8),desArg(9)]bradykinin) selective for the B-1 receptor. The affinity of MEN16132 and other antagonists was determined by inhibition curves (pK(i) values in the rabbit and pig assay, respectively): MEN16132 (10.4 and 10.3) and peptide compounds such as icatibant (10.1 and 9.9) and MEN11270 (10.3 and 10.1) displayed subnanomolar potency in both assays; the nonpeptide LF16-0687 (8.4 and 8.5) and FR173657 (8.2 and 9.1) exhibited a different affinity pattern, whereas WIN64338 displayed low affinity (5.7 and <= 5). Results are discussed focusing on comparisons with previous findings obtained in rabbit and pig vascular functional assays, but also with those obtained in analog guinea pig and mouse assays and at the human B-2 receptor. An attempt to highlight differences which can undertake ligands selectivity across the species is presented. In conclusion, the present study indicates MEN16132 as the only nonpeptidic compound which displays an even subnanomolar affinity for the rabbit and pig B-2 receptor. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Human brain contains a novel non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site for active angiotensin peptides	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						brain angiotensin system; angiotensin receptors; gender; parachloromercuribenzoate; thiols; radioligand binding	II RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; AMINO-ACID-SEQUENCE; THIMET OLIGOPEPTIDASE; CONVERTING ENZYME; PROTEIN; IDENTIFICATION; PURIFICATION; MECHANISMS; INHIBITORS	Aims: To determine whether the novel non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site for angiotensins recently discovered in rodent brains occurs in the human brain. Main methods: Radioligand binding assays of I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II binding were carried out in homogenates of the rostral pole of the temporal cortex of human brains containing 0.3 mM parachloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), 10 mu M losartan to saturate AT1 receptors, 10 mu M PD123319 to saturate AT2 receptors, with or without 10 mu M angiotensin II to define specific binding. Competition binding assays employed a variety of angiotensin peptides, specific angiotensin receptor antagonists, several neuropeptides and an endopeptidase inhibitor to determine pharmacological specificity for this binding site. Key findings: The novel non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site was present in similar amounts in female and male brains: Bmax 1.77 +/- 0.16 and 1.52 +/- 0.17 fmol/mg initial wet weight in female and male brains, respectively. The K-D values, 1.79 +/- 0.09 nM for females, and 1.53 +/- 0.06 nM for males were also similar. The binding site shows pharmacological specificity similar to that in rodent brains: sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II > angiotensin III > angiotensin II > angiotensin I'angiotensin IV > angiotensin 1-7. Shorter angiotensin fragments and non-angiotensin peptides showed low affinity for this binding site. Significance: The presence in human brain of this novel non-AT1, non-AT2 binding site supports the concept that this binding site is an important component of the brain angiotensin system. The functional significance of this binding site, either as a novel angiotensin receptor or a highly specific angiotensinase remains to be determined. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DM on the density and distribution of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) in the rabbit kidney. Quantification of the NOS radioligand on slide-mounted sections was compared with the nitroblue tetrazolium reaction, Where the intensity of the reaction varies with the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide diaphorase (NADPH-d) activity of NOS. Materials and methods: DM was induced with alloxan in six New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits. Plasma creatinine, urea and electrolytes were monitored at monthly intervals. The kidneys were removed following 6 months of DM. Transverse serial sections were cut and low-resolution autoradiography was performed using a radioligand for NOS ([H-3]-NOARG). Histochemical localisation of NADPH-d activity was also performed. Densitometric analysis was performed on the autoradiographs and the results compared with those obtained from six age-matched control rabbits. Results: There was a significant (p < 0.01) rise in plasma creatinine levels in the diabetic rabbits, although the mean values remained within the reference range. There was a significant (p < 0.0001) down-regulation of NOS binding sites in both the cortex and medulla of the DM kidney when compared with the controls. A similar decrease in NADPH-d activity was seen in the diabetic renal cortex and medulla, In addition, NADPH-d activity also appeared to be reduced in the diabetic glomeruli when compared with controls. Conclusions: NOS binding sites and NADPH-d activity are significantly decreased in the DM renal cortex and medulla. These changes are associated with a mild deterioration in renal function and may be an early event that could subsequently play a role in the progression of DM nephropathy. Manipulating the NO pathway during the early stages of DM nephropathy may be beneficial.

However, this radioligand offers disadvantages in routine clinical settings because of its short radioisotope half- life (eg PET facilities within hospitals without a cyclotron need to acquire such radioligands from distant cyclotron units for clinical use). S-([F-18] fluoromethyl)-(+)-McN5652 ([F-18](+)-FMe-McN5652) is an analogue which has been synthesized newly, and has a significantly longer radioisotope half- life. In the porcine brain, it demonstrates the same characteristic distribution pattern of serotonin-uptake sites like the C-11-labeled congener with the highest binding in the midbrain and thalamus and the lowest in the cerebellum and occipital cortex. It shows a 30% higher blood - brain transfer and a slower peripheral metabolism than [C-11](+)-McN5652. Rather uniform brain binding was observed after injection of the pharmacologically inactive radiolabeled enantiomer, or after pretreatment with the highly selective SERT inhibitor citalopram. The norepinephrine uptake inhibitor maprotiline did not show any inhibitory effect. Using a one-tissue compartment model (K-1, k(2)") or a two-tissue compartment model (K-1 to k(4)) with or without constraints for calculation, the regional binding parameters of [C-11](+)-McN5652 and [F-18](+)-FMe-McN5652 are highly correlated among each other and with the SERT density, as determined by in vitro binding of [H-3]citalopram. Using constraints to correct for the free fraction and nonspecific binding of the radiotracers, a considerable increase of the midbrain-occipital cortex ratios with higher values for [F-18](+)-FMe-McN5652 compared to [C-11](+)McN5652 was revealed. It is concluded that [F-18](+)-FMe-McN5652 has better features than [C-11](+) McN5652 for SERT imaging with PET.

However, different methods to improve the objective response rate and survival are under investigation. This includes changes of the radioligand, dosimetry and combination therapy with different agents, such as radiosensitisers. Hofving et al. recently reported, in the April 2019 issue of Endocrine-Related Cancer, the use of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) modulation to augment radiation effects as a new promising target for radiosensitisation. In this commentary, new developments in the field of PRRT are discussed, placing these new findings about Hsp90 inhibitors into context.

In preclinicaldevelopment, the safety profile of RLT drug candidate(s) is investigatedat relatively low dose levels using the cold (non-radioactive, e.g., Lu-175) ligand as a surrogate of the hot (radioactive, e.g., Lu-177) one in the "ligand-linker-chelator" complex.The formulation of the test article used in preclinical safety studiescontains a mixture of free ligand (i.e., ligand-linker-chelator withoutmetal) and cold ligand (i.e., ligand-linker-chelator with non-radioactivemetal) in a similar molar ratio as seen under the manufacturing conditionsfor the RLT drug for clinical use, where only a fraction of free ligandmolecules chelate the radioactive metal to form a hot ligand. In thisvery first report of LC-MS/MS bioanalysis of RLT moleculesin support of a regulated preclinical safety assessment study, a highlyselective and sensitive LC-MS/MS bioanalytical method was developedfor the simultaneous determination of free ligand (NVS001) and coldligand (Lu-175-NVS001) in rat and dog plasma. Several unexpectedtechnical challenges in relation to LC-MS/MS of RLT moleculeswere successfully addressed. The challenges include poor assay sensitivityof the free ligand NVS001, formation of the free ligand (NVS001) withendogenous metal (e.g., potassium), Ga loss from the Ga-chelated internalstandard during sample extraction and analysis, "instability"of the analytes at low concentrations, and inconsistent IS responsein the extracted plasma samples. The methods were validated accordingto the current regulatory requirements in a dynamic range of 0.5-250ng/mL for both the free and cold ligands using a 25 & mu;L samplevolume. The validated method was successfully implemented in sampleanalysis in support of regulated safety studies, with very good resultsfrom incurred sample reanalysis. The current LC-MS/MS workflowcan be expanded to quantitative analysis of other RLTs in supportof preclinical RLT drug development.

No study has previously assessed treatment outcome and survival following Ac-225-PSMA-617 treatment of de novo metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate carcinoma (mHSPC) patients. Based on the potential side effects that are known and explained to the patients by the oncologist, some of the patients refused the standard treatment and are seeking alternative therapies. Thus, we report our preliminary findings in a retrospective series of 21 mHSPC patients that refused standard treatment options and were treated with Ac-225-PSMA-617.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed patients with histologically confirmed de novo treatment-naive bone +/- visceral mHSPC that were treated with Ac-225-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT). Inclusion criteria included an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 2, treatment-naive bone +/- visceral mHSPC, and patients refusal for ADT +/- docetaxel, abiraterone acetate, or enzalutamide. We evaluated the response to treatment using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as well as the toxicities.ResultsTwenty-one mHSPC patients were included in this preliminary work. Following treatment, twenty patients (95%) had any decline in PSA and eighteen patients (86%) presented with a PSA decline of >= 50% including 4 patients in whom PSA became undetectable. A lower percentage decrease in PSA following treatment was associated with increased mortality and shorter progression-free survival. Overall, administration of Ac-225-PSMA-617 was well tolerated. The commonest toxicity seen was grade I/II dry mouth observed in 94% of patients.ConclusionsGiven these favorable results, randomized prospective multicenter trials assessing the clinical value of Ac-225-PSMA-617 as a therapeutic agent for mHSPC administered either as monotherapy or administered concomitant with ADT are of interest.

Despite favorable preliminary results, it has not been used further for studies of mGluR5. This paper presents an in-depth preclinical evaluation of [18F]FMTEB in healthy Sprague Dawley rats.Methods: [18F]FMTEB was synthesized from a boronic ester precursor using copper-mediated fluorination. In vivo PET imaging was performed on six rats, of which three were pre-treated with a high affinity mGluR5 receptor antagonist. An additional 18 rats were used for ex vivo experiments for metabolite analyses in plasma, brain and urine, and for biodistribution and ex vivo brain autoradiography at different time points.Results: [18F]FMTEB was synthesized in adequate radiochemical yield and a molar activity of 154 +/- 64 GBq/ mu mol. Both in vivo imaging and ex vivo brain autoradiography showed high specificity for mGluR5, and the blocking experiments showed a clear decrease in radioactivity in mGluR5-rich brain areas. Metabolite analyses confirmed fast metabolism of the tracer in plasma. The percentage of parent compound in brain tissue exceeded 90 % up to 90 min after injection.Conclusion: [18F]FMTEB produced via copper-mediated 18F-fluorination fulfilled the requirements for preclinical evaluation in rats. The absence of specific uptake in cerebellum and absence of defluorination of the tracer allowed cerebellum to be used as a reference tissue. Due to the fast kinetics in rats, the region-to-cerebellum ratios equilibrated within 30 min. These results prove [18F]FMTEB to be a good candidate for mapping mGluR5 in rat brain and a suitable alternative to [18F]FPEB.

Expression profile of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, B, and C paralogues in temporal neocortex tissue from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)	MOLECULAR BRAIN			English	Article						SV2 paralogues; Temporal lobe epilepsy; Neocortex; snRNA-seq; [H-3]-UCB-J	PROTEIN 2A; BINDING-SITE; CELL-TYPES; SV2C; DENSITY; BRAIN; RNA	Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein-2 (SV2) is a family of proteins consisting of SV2A, SV2B, and SV2C. This protein family has attracted attention in recent years after SV2A was shown to be an epileptic drug target and a perhaps a biomarker of synaptic density. So far, the anatomical localization of these proteins in the rodent and human brain have been reported, but co-expression of SV2 genes on a cellular level, their expressions in the human brain, comparison to radioligand binding, any possible regulation in epilepsy are not known. We have here analyzed the expression of SV2 genes in neuronal subtypes in the temporal neocortex in selected specimens by using single nucleus-RNA sequencing, and performed quantitative PCR in populations of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients and healthy controls. [H-3]-UCB-J autoradiography was performed to analyze the correlation between the mRNA transcript and binding capacity to SV2A. Our data showed that the SV2A transcript is expressed in all glutamatergic and GABAergic cortical subtypes, while SV2B expression is restricted to only the glutamatergic neurons and SV2C has very limited expression in a small subgroup of GABAergic interneurons. The level of [H-3]-UCB-J binding and the concentration of SV2A mRNA is strongly correlated in each patient, and the expression is lower in the TLE patients. There is no relationship between SV2A expression and age, sex, seizure frequency, duration of epilepsy, or whether patients were recently treated with levetiracetam or not. Collectively, these findings point out a neuronal subtype-specific distribution of the expression of the three SV2 genes, and the lower levels of both radioligand binding and expression further emphasize the significance of these proteins in this disease.

However, because of the mainly renal excretion of the tracer, the kidneys are one of the most limiting organs. The purpose of this study was to examine the post-therapeutic changes in renal function over time and to identify risk factors for developing renal toxicity. We also tested the reliability of markers for renal function monitoring. Methods Fifty-five patients with castrate-resistant metastatic prostate cancer treated with at least three cycles of [Lu-177] Lu-PSMA-617 were investigated. Renal function was assessed through laboratory tests (creatinine, GFR, cystatin C) and Tc-99 m-MAG3 measurements. Adverse events were classified according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. To identify risk factors for renal toxicity, we used Pearson's correlation coefficient and the corresponding p values. Results None of the 55 patients experienced severe nephrotoxicity (grade 3/4). In 14 patients (25%), we observed increased creatinine levels of CTC 1 degrees or 2 degrees. There were 16 cases of increased GFR (grade 1/2). At the baseline, only 14 patients had elevated cystatin C. However, post-therapeutic cystatin C was elevated in 32 patients (58%). A significant effect on renal function was found for age (p = 0.049), hypertension (p = 0.001) and pre-existing kidney disease (p = 0.001). The most reliable predictive markers of nephrotoxicity were TERMAG3 and cystatin C. Conclusion Renal toxicity in patients treated with [Lu-177] Lu-PSMA-617 was low. There was no (sub) acute grade 3 or 4 nephrotoxicity.

Microglia is a key component of the brain immunity. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that microglial modulators may improve morphine-induced analgesia and prevent the development of tolerance and dependence. Positron emission tomography (PET) using translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) radioligand is a clinically validated strategy for the non-invasive detection of microglial activation. We hypothesized that TSPO PET imaging may be used to study the neuroimmune component of opioid tolerance and withdrawal. Methods: Healthy rats (n=6 in each group) received either saline or escalating doses of morphine (10-40 mg/kg) on five days to achieve tolerance and a withdrawal syndrome after morphine discontinuation. MicroPET imaging with [F-18]DPA-714 was performed 60 h after morphine withdrawal. Kinetic modeling was performed to estimate [F-18]DPA-714 volume of distribution (V-T) in several brain regions using dynamic PET images and corresponding metabolite-corrected input functions. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) experiments on striatal brain slices were performed to assess the expression of glial markers (Iba1, GFAP and CD68) during 14 days after morphine discontinuation. Results: The baseline binding of [F-18]DPA-714 to the brain (V-T=0.086 +/- 0.009 mL cm(-3)) was not increased by morphine exposure and withdrawal (V-T = 0.079 +/- 0.010 mL cm(-3)) indicating the absence of TSPO over expression, even at the regional level.

However, there are no systematic studies that investigate all cardiac chambers with regard to receptor density and cAMP (adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate) responses. We used meat-type turkey poults (British United Turkey (B.U.T.) Big 6) with increasing age because their heart seems to decrease in weight in relation to body weight and they are often used as an animal model for heart failure. The receptor density and distribution were quantified by radioligand binding analysis using (-)-[I-125]-iodocyanopindolol and beta-adrenoceptor subtype-specific antagonists (ICI 118.551 and CGP 20712 A) in membranes of four cardiac chambers (right and left atria and ventricles) of 6-week-, 12-week, 16/21-week-, and 57-week-old B.U.T. BIG 6 turkeys. Receptor function was determined by measuring basal and stimulated cAMP production. In both sexes, the beta-adrenoceptor density decreased significantly in all chambers with age without altered beta-adrenoceptor subtype distribution. The receptor affinity (K-D) to the radioligand was similar in hearts of all age groups. beta-adrenoceptor-(isoproterenol and guanosine 5'-triphosphate), G-protein-(NaF) and catalytic unit of adenylate cyclase (forskolin, Mn2+ mediated cAMP responses were not chamber-dependent. Indeed, the cAMP level was significantly lower in 57-week-old hearts than in 6-week -, 12-week, 16/21-week-old hearts. These data suggest that with increasing age and body weight, the beta-adrenoceptor signal transduction pathway was highly blunted in all cardiac chambers, occurring by decreased receptor density and cAMP responses.

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at rs16139 (T1128C) within the NPY-gene identified an amino acid substitution from leucine (L) to proline (P) (L7P) associated with both glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine: (i) the influence of autoantibodies to leucine neuropeptide Y (NPY-LA) and autoantibodies to proline neuropeptide Y (NPY-PA) on the diagnostic sensitivity of type 1 diabetes (T1D), (ii) the association of NPYA with major islet autoantibodies, and (iii) the association of NPYA with HLA-DQ genotypes in newly diagnosed T1D patients. MethodsSerum from the HLA-DQ typed T1D patients (n = 673; median age 10 yr) from Skane, Sweden, were analyzed for autoantibodies against NPY-L and NPY-P in a radioligand binding assay, and against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 (GAD65), insulin, insulinoma associated protein-2 (IA-2), and zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) in addition to islet cell antibodies (ICA). A total of 1006 subjects (median age 9 yr) were used as controls. ResultsA total of 9.2% (n = 62) of the T1D patients were positive for NPY-LA (p < 0.001) and 7.6% (n = 51) for NPY-PA (p < 0.001) compared to 1.1% (n = 11) in controls. The NPY-LA and NPY-PA appeared together ( = 0.63; p < 0.001) and the median levels correlated (R-2 = 0.603; p < 0.001). T1D patients diagnosed after 10 yr of age were at an increased risk for NPYA at diagnosis [odds ratio (OR = 2.46; 95% CI 1.46-4.16; p = 0.001)] adjusted for age at diagnosis, gender, autoantibody positivity, and HLA. ConclusionsNPY is a minor autoantigen in children with newly diagnosed T1D. Therefore, NPY autoantibodies may be investigated in T1D autoimmunity.

In vitro screening of major neurotransmitter systems possibly involved in the mechanism of action of antibodies to S100 protein in released-active form	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT			English	Article						dopamine agent; released-activity; serotonin agent; sigma(1) receptor	5-HT1A RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; ULTRALOW-DOSE ANTIBODIES; MODULATION; SEROTONIN; DOPAMINE-D-2; ACTIVATION; FLUOXETINE; BEHAVIOR; AGONIST	Experimentally and clinically, it was shown that released-active form of antibodies to S100 protein (RAF of Abs to S100) exerts a wide range of pharmacological activities: anxiolytic, antiasthenic, antiaggressive, stress-protective, antihypoxic, antiischemic, neuroprotective, and nootropic. The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of RAF of Abs to S100 on major neurotransmitter systems (serotoninergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic, and on sigma receptors as well) which are possibly involved in its mechanism of pharmacological activity. Radioligand binding assays were used for assessment of the drug influence on ligand-receptor interaction. [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assay, cyclic adenosine monophosphate HTRF (TM), cellular dielectric spectroscopy assays, and assays based on measurement of intracellular concentration of Ca2+ ions were used for assessment of agonist or antagonist properties of the drug toward receptors. RAF of Abs to S100 increased radioligand binding to 5-HT1F, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2Cedited, 5-HT3, and to D3 receptors by 142.0%, 131.9%, 149.3%, 120.7%, and 126.3%, respectively. Also, the drug significantly inhibited specific binding of radioligands to GABAB1A/B2 receptors by 25.8%, and to both native and recombinant human sigma(1) receptors by 75.3% and 40.32%, respectively. In the functional assays, it was shown that the drug exerted antagonism at 5-HT1B, D3, and GABA(B1A/B2) receptors inhibiting agonist-induced responses by 23.24%, 32.76%, and 30.2%, respectively. On the contrary, the drug exerted an agonist effect at 5-HT1A receptors enhancing receptor functional activity by 28.0%. The pharmacological profiling of RAF of Abs to S100 among 27 receptor provides evidence for drug-related modification of major neurotransmitter systems.

JN403 was evaluated in a number of in vitro systems of different species, at recombinant receptors using radioligand binding, signal transduction and electrophysiological studies. When using [1251] alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-BTX) as a radioligand, JN403 has high affinity for human recombinant nAChR 0 (pK(D) = 6.7). Functionally, JN403 is a partial and potent agonist at human nAChR alpha 7. The compound stimulates calcium influx in GH3 cells recombinantly expressing the human nAChR with an pEC(50) of 7.0 and an E-max. of 85% (compared to the full agonist epibatidine). In Xenopus oocytes expressing human nAChR 0 JN403 induces inward currents with an pEC50 of 5.7 and an E-max, of 55%. In both recombinant systems JN403 is a partial agonist and the agonistic effects are blocked after pre-administration of methyllycaconitine (MLA, 100 nM), a nAChR 0 antagonist. In functional calcium influx assays, JN403 displays a significantly lower potency for other subtypes of human nAChRs like alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 3 beta 4, alpha 1 p 1 gamma delta as well as 5HT(3) receptors when tested functionally as an antagonist (PIC50 < 4.8) and is devoid of agonistic activity (pEC50 < 4). Similarly, JN403 shows low binding activity at a wide panel of neurotransmitter receptors. Thus, JN403 is a potent and selective nAChR 0 agonist and will be a useful tool for the characterization of nAChR 0 mediated effects both in vitro and in vivo. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Objective: Investigate the role of adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors in the discriminative-stimulus effects of caffeine. Methods: Rats were trained to discriminate an injection of 30 mg/kg ( i.p.) caffeine from saline. The selective A(1) receptor antagonist CPT, the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist MSX-3 and the non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist DMPX were assessed for their ability to produce caffeine-like discriminative effects. The ability of CPT, MSX-3, the A(1) receptor agonist CPA and the A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680 to reduce the discriminative effects of caffeine was also tested. Radioligand binding experiments with membrane preparations from rat striatum and transfected mammalian cell lines were performed to characterize binding affinity profiles of the different adenosine antagonists used in the present study ( caffeine, DMPX, CPT and MSX-3) in relation to all known adenosine receptors (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), A(3)). Results: DMPX and CPT, but not MSX-3, produced significant caffeine-like discriminative effects. MSX-3, but not CPT, markedly reduced the discriminative effects of caffeine and the caffeine-like discriminative effects of CPT. Furthermore, the A(1) receptor agonist CPA, but not the A(2A) agonist CGS21680, reduced caffeine's discriminative effects. Conclusions: Adenosine A(1) receptor blockade is involved in the discriminative-stimulus effects of behaviorally relevant doses of caffeine; A(2A) receptor blockade does not play a central role in caffeine's discriminative effects and counteracts the A(1) receptor-mediated discriminative-stimulus effects of caffeine.

Increasing evidences support the assumption that the D3 receptors are occupied to a high degree by dopamine at physiological conditions. Research on the functional role of the D3 receptors in brain has however been hampered by the lack of D3 selective ligands. In the present Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study the binding of the novel, putative dopamine-D3 receptor ligand, [C-11]RGH-1756 was characterized in the cynomolgus monkey brain. [C-11]RGH-1756 was rather homogenously distributed in brain and the regional binding potential (BP) values ranged between 0.17 and 0.48. Pretreatment with unlabel led RGH-1756 decreased radioligand binding to the level of the cerebellum in most brain areas. The regional BP values were lower after intravenous injection of a higher mass of RGH-1756, indicating saturable binding of [C-11]RGH-1756. The D2/D3 antagonist raclopride partly inhibited the binding of [C-11]RGH-1756 in several brain areas, including the striatum, mesencephalon and neocortex, whereas the 5HT(1A) antagonist WAY-100635 had no evident effect on [C-11]RGH-1756 binding. Despite the promising binding characteristics of RGH-1756 in vitro the present PET-study indicates that [C-11]RGH-1756 provides a low signal for specific binding to the D3 receptor in vivo. One explanation is that the favorable binding characteristics of RGH-1756 in vitro are not manifested in vivo. Alternatively, the results may support the hypothesis that the dopamine-D3 receptors are indeed occupied to a high extent by dopamine in vivo and thus not available for radioligand binding.

J	Deane, CM; Lummis, SCR				Deane, CM; Lummis, SCR			The role and predicted propensity of conserved proline residues in the 5-HT3 receptor	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CIS PEPTIDE-BONDS; LIGAND-BINDING; PROTEIN; SUBUNIT; LOOP; CONFORMATIONS; MUTAGENESIS; EXPRESSION; M2-M3; STEP	5-HT3, receptors possess a number of highly conserved proline residues. We changed each of these to alanine, expressed the mutants as homomeric 5-HT3A receptors in HEK293 cells, and analyzed them with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immunocytochemistry. Mutation of Pro(58), Pro(104), Pro(123), and Pro(170) resulted in ablation of radioligand binding, whereas mutation of Pro(257) and Pro(301) did not. Only the latter were expressed at the plasma membrane but were non-functional. Thus the former, which are in the N-terminal domain, may be involved in forming correct receptor structure, while those in the transmembrane region (Pro(257) and Pro(301)) are necessary for the function of the protein. To explore the conformational preference (propensity) of these residues we examined the proportion of cis-prolines and the influence of adjacent residues in known protein structures. 4.7% of prolines in the protein data base were in the cis conformation, and the distribution of amino acids adjacent to cis-prolines was not randomly distributed. Comparison of the proportion of each amino acid residue adjacent to a cis-proline revealed that aromatic and bend-facilitating residues were favored while those with beta -branched chains were not. Thus five residues (Gly, Pro, Tyr, Trp, Phe) and three residues (Pro, Tyr, Phe) were found more frequently than expected before and after cis-prolines respectively, whereas five residues (Val, Ile, Leu, Asp, Thr) and two residues (Asp, Glu) were found less frequently. Of the 20 proline residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit only Pro(170) has adjacent residues that are favorable. Mutating these to non-favorable residues resulted in ablation of ligand binding, whereas replacement with alternative favorable residues did not. We therefore propose that Pro(170), which is part of the characteristic cys-loop found in this family of proteins, may be in the cis conformation.

SCH-202676 inhibited radioligand binding to a number of structurally distinct, heterologously expressed GPCRs, including the human mu-, delta-, and kappa- opioid, alpha- and beta -adrenergic, muscarinic M-1 and M-2, and dopaminergic D-1 and D-2 receptors, but not to the tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor. SCH-202676 had no direct effect on G protein activity as assessed by [S-35] guanosine-5'-O-(gamma -thio) triphosphate binding to purified recombinant G(o alpha)- or G(beta gamma)-stimulated ADP-ribosylation of G(o alpha) by pertussis toxin. In addition, SCH-202676 inhibited antagonist binding to the beta (2)-adrenergic receptor expressed in Escherichia coli, a system devoid of classical heterotrimeric G proteins. SCH-202676 inhibited radiolabeled agonist and antagonist binding to the alpha (2a)-adrenergic receptor with an IC50 value of 0.5 muM, decreased the B-max value of the binding sites with a slight increase in the K-D value, and inhibited agonist-induced activation of the receptor. The effects of SCH-202676 were reversible. Incubation of plasma membranes with 10 muM SCH-202676 did not alter subsequent radioligand binding to the alpha (2a)-adrenergic receptor and the dopaminergic D-1 receptor. Taken together, our data suggest that SCH-202676 has the unique ability to allosterically regulate agonist and antagonist binding to GPCRs in a manner that is both selective and reversible. The scope of the data presented suggests this occurs by direct interaction with a structural motif common to a large number of GPCRs or by activation/inhibition of an unidentified accessory protein that regulates GPCR function.

Radioligand (RLT) therapy with [Lu-177]Lu-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an emerging treatment for metastasized mCRPC and its efficacy is assessed not only but also by prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurement after 12 weeks or more after treatment. Our aim was to evaluate the role of early PSA measurement after RLT in predicting overall survival (OS) of mCRPC patients.Methods A systematic search on PubMed, Web Of Science and Scopus was performed from January to December 2022. PRISMA guidelines for prognostic studies was adopted. Risk of bias was assessed using quality of prognostic studies (QUIPS).Results Twelve studies at low-intermediate risk of bias, were included in the meta-analysis (1646 patients, mean age 70 years). About 50% of patients showed a PSA decline after 1-2 of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA, and more than 30% reported a PSA decline = 50%. The median OS range for patients with any PSA decline was 13-20 months, while for patients with stable or increased PSA, the median OS fell to 6-12 months. The OS rate for a PSA decline after the one-two [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA cycles was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.31-0.50), while OS for a PSA decline =50% was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.57-0.83).Conclusions A PSA decline is observed in almost 50% of mCRPC patients after 1-2 [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA cycles, with a significantly longer OS compared to stable or increased PSA levels, respectively. Accordingly, any PSA decline after 1-2 cycles of therapy should be regarded as a favourable prognostic factor for OS.

[C-11]2 is potentially suitable for imaging H-3 receptors in rat and monkey brains, which has motivated us to perform first-in-human study of [C-11] for qualifying H-3 receptors in human brain. In this paper, we report an efficient radiosynthesis of [C-11]2 to obtain sufficient radioactivity and high quality for clinical application. Methods: In manual synthesis, we optimized the reaction conditions of desmethyl precursor 1, which contains a 2-hydroxypyridine moiety, with [C-11]Mel or [C-11]Mel or [C-11]MeOTf. After optimization, we performed automated synthesis and quality control of [C-11]2. Results: Bubbling [C-11]MeOTf into a heated mixture of precursor 1 and cesium carbonate in DMF at 100 degrees C for 90 s produced [C-11]2 with decay-corrected radiochemical yields of (based on[C-11]CO2) 7.9 +/- 1.8% (n = 78).The specific activity of [C-11]2 was 156 +/- 52 GBq/mu mol (n = 78) at the end of synthesis. The total synthesis time was approximately 35 min from the end of bombardment. All the quality control results of [C-11]2 were in compliance with our in-house quality control/assurance specifications. Conclusion: We radiosynthesized [C-11]TASP457 ([C-11]2) with sufficient amounts of radioactivity and high quality for clinical usefulness. This radioligand is being used for PET assessment of H-3 receptors in human brain in our facility. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Past studies using positron emission tomography (PET) that examined neuroinflammation in patients with SCZ in vivo using the translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO) target were limited by the insensitivity of the first-generation imaging agent [C-11]-PK11195, scanners used, and the small sample sizes studied. Present study uses a novel second-generation TSPO PET radioligand N-acetyl-N-(2-[F-18]fluoroethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxy-5-pyridinamine ([F-18]-FEPPA) to evaluate whether there is increased neuroinflammation in patients with SCZ. A cross-sectional study was performed using [F-18]-FEPPA and a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT). Eighteen patients with SCZ with ongoing psychotic symptoms and 27 healthy volunteers (HV) were recruited from a tertiary psychiatric clinical setting and the community, respectively. All participants underwent [F-18]-FEPPA PET and magnetic resonance imaging, and PET data were analyzed to obtain [F-18]-FEPPA total volume of distribution (V (T)) using a 2-tissue compartment model with an arterial plasma input function, as previously validated. All subjects were classified as high-, medium- or low-affinity [F-18]-FEPPA binders on the basis of rs6971 polymorphism, and genotype information was incorporated into the analyses of imaging outcomes. No significant differences in neuroinflammation indexed as [F-18]-FEPPA V (T) were observed between groups in either gray (F ((1,39)) = 0.179, P = .674) or white matter regions (F ((1,38)) = 0.597, P = .445). The lack of significant difference in neuroinflammation in treated patients with SCZ in the midst of a psychotic episode and HV suggests that neuroinflammatory processes may take place early in disease progression or are affected by antipsychotic treatment.

Characterization of FlipIDAM as a SERT-selective SPECT imaging agent	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						SERT; SPECT; 5-HIT; Brain imaging; Radioligand	SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER BINDING; UPTAKE SITES; BRAIN; DEPRESSION; PAROXETINE; CITALOPRAM; PET; ANTIDEPRESSANT; VALIDATION; OCCUPANCY	Introduction: Biological evaluation of [I-125]FlipIDAM (2-((2-((dimethylamino)methyl)-4-iodophenyl)thio)phenyl)methanol ([I-125]4), a new single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) radioligand for imaging the serotonin transporter (SERT) which displayed improved in vivo kinetics for mapping SERT binding sites in the brain. Methods: In vitro binding studies of [I-125]4 were performed with membrane homogenates of LLC-PK1 cells stably transfected and overexpressing one of the monoamine transporter (SERT, DAT or NET) and rat cortical homogenates. Biodistribution and ex vivo autoradiography studies were carried out in rats. In vivo competition experiments were evaluated to determine the SERT selectivity of [I-125]4 vs. [I-125]IDAM ([I-125]1). Results: In vitro binding studies of 4 showed excellent binding affinity (K-i,K-SERT = 0.90 +/- 0.05 nM) and excellent selectivity over the other monoamine transporters (100 fold and >4000 fold for NET and DAT respectively). Scatchard analysis of saturation binding of [I-125]4 to rat cortical homogenates gave a K-d value of 0.5 +/- 0.09 nM and a B-max value of 801.4 +/- 58.08 fmol/mg protein. The biodistribution study showed rapid high brain uptake (3.09 +/- 0.11% dose/organ at 2 min) and a good target to non-target ratio (hypothalamus to cerebellum) at 30 min (2.62) compared to [I-125]1 (2.19). Ex vivo autoradiography showed that FlipIDAM localizes in accordance with SERT distribution patterns in the brain. In vivo and ex vivo competition experiments with specific and non-specific SERT compounds also showed that [I-125]4 binds specifically to SERT rich regions. Conclusions: The biological evaluation of [I-125]4 demonstrates that [I-125]4 would be a good candidate for SPECT imaging of SERT. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Radiation dosimetry and biodistribution in monkey and man of <SUP>11</SUP>C-PBR28:: A PET radioligand to image inflammation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						translocator protein (18 kDa); source organ; C-11-PBR28; PET	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN 18 KDA; BRAIN; LIGANDS; BINDING; DAA1106; TISSUE; RAT	C-11-PBR28 ([methyl-C-11]N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)-2phenoxy-5-pyridinamine) is a recently developed radioligand to image peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs) in brain. The aim of this study was to estimate the human radiation doses of C-11-PBR28 based on biodistribution data in monkeys and humans. In addition, we scanned 1 human subject who fortuitously behaved as if he lacked the PBR binding protein. Methods: Whole-body PBR images were acquired after intravenous bolus administration of C-11-PBR28 in 7 healthy humans (651 +/- 111 MBq) and 2 rhesus monkeys (370 +/- 59.9MBq). One monkey was scanned after receptor blockade with PK 11195 (10.7 mg/kg intravenously). Results: For typical subjects (subjects 1 - 6), the 3 organs with highest exposure were those with the high PBR densities (kidneys, spleen, and lungs), and the effective dose was 6.6 mu Sv/MBq. The unusual subject (subject 7) had 60% - 90% less uptake in these 3 organs, resulting in 28% lower effective dose. The activity in the baseline monkey scans was greater than that in humans for organs with high PBR densities. For this reason, the human effective dose was overestimated by 60% with monkey biodistribution data. The monkey with receptor blockade had an overall distribution qualitatively similar to that of the unusual human subject (subject 7), with decreased exposure to lungs, kidney, and spleen. Conclusion: The effective dose of C-11-PBR28 was modest and was similar to that of several other C-11-radioligands. Lack of receptor binding in the unusual human subject and in the monkey with receptor blockade decreased exposure to organs with high PER densities and enhanced uptake in excretory and metabolic pathways.

J	Cabrera, DM; Janech, MG; Morinelli, TA; Miller, DH				Cabrera, DM; Janech, MG; Morinelli, TA; Miller, DH			A thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> system in the Atlantic stingray, <i>Dasyatis sabina</i>	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						thromboxane; stingray; Dasyatis	FATTY-ACID COMPOSITIONS; PROSTANOID RECEPTORS; IN-VITRO; PROSTAGLANDIN; BINDING; CONTRACTIONS; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; PLATELETS; VESSELS	Thromboxane B-2 (TXB2) is the stable metabolite of thromboxane A(2) (TXA(2)) and thromboxane B-2-like immunoreactivity (iTXB(2)) has been identified in the plasma of the Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina (0.57 +/- 0.03 ng/ml). Plasma levels of iTXB(2) increase if the blood is allowed to clot (3.0 +/- 0.27 ng/ml). When clotting occurs in the presence of indomethacin, this increase is partially inhibited (1.5 +/- 0.17 ng/ml), indicating the presence of a cyclooxygenase activity. Radioligand binding analysis using the TXA2 analog [I-125]BOP in isolated kidney membranes revealed a receptor of K-d = 2.88 +/- 0.51 nM and B-max = 25.6 +/- 5.9 fmol/mg protein. [I-125]BOP binding was displaced by the TXA(2) receptor (TP receptor) agonists U46619 (IC50 = 106.4 +/- 15.7 nM) and U44069 (IC50 = 88.7 +/- 13.0 nM), and the antagonist SQ29548 (IC50 = 51.0 +/- 12.9 nM). Binding was also displaced stereoselectively by the antagonists (-)L657925 (IC50 = 18.9 +/- 3.8 nM) and (+)L657926 (IC50 = 2025 +/- 280 nM). Tissue bath studies revealed that U46619, a stable TXA(2) mimetic, elicited concentration-dependent contractions in the ventral aorta which were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the TP receptor antagonist SQ29548. Using a human TP receptor riboprobe, Northern blotting of mRNA isolated from the stingray kidney identified transcripts of 2.8 and 6 kb. The 2.8 kb transcript is similar to a 2.8 kb transcript found in human cells or tissues, but the 6 kb transcript may be unique. These data indicate the presence of a TXB2-like substance in the blood, a TP receptor in the kidney, TXA(2) biological activity in the ventral aorta, and expression of a TP receptor-like gene.

The syntheses included azeotropic drying of the [18F]fluoride, nucleophilic 18F-fluorination of bis(tosyloxy)-[di-deutero]methane, HPLC purification and subsequent formulation of the synthesized [18F]fluoro-[di-deutero]methyl tosylate (d2-[18F]FMT) in organic solvents. Automation shortened the total synthesis time to 50min, resulting in an average radiochemical yield of about 50% and high radiochemical purity (>98%). The possible application of this procedure to commercially available synthesis modules might be of significance for the production of deuterated 18F-fluoromethylated imaging probes in the future.

This purification led to the isolation of two compounds identified as (+)-boldine (1) and (+)-dehydrovomifoliol (2). (+)-Boldine binds to 5-HT2A receptors at high concentrations with a K-i value of 2.16 mu m. However, (+)-dehydrovomifoliol showed minimal competitive inhibition on the binding of [H-3]ketanserin to the same receptor with a K-i value of 2.06 mM. These results suggest that (+)-boldine influences the activity of 5-HT2A receptors through competitive binding as an agonist or antagonist. Copyright (C) 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this clinical setting, then it is important to understand how androgens and ADT affect the tumor uptake of new-generation imaging agents. ADT typically decreases the uptake of metabolic tracers such as FDG, radiolabeled choline, and fluciclovine, whereas the effect on the expression of transmembrane proteins such as PSMA is more complex and may depend on the tumor biology and the time of imaging after the start of ADT. Additional prospective studies are needed to understand this dynamic behavior and how it may be leveraged optimally for imaging and for radioligand therapy.

High throughput screening (HTS) efforts identified a number of potent and selective NR2B antagonists such as 1. Exploration of the substituents around the core of this template identified a number of compounds with high potency for NR2B (pIC(50) > 7) and good selectivity against the NR2A subunit (pIC(50) < 4.3) as defined by FLIPR-Ca2+ and radioligand binding studies.

Noninvasive imaging methods aiding early diagnosis will significantly improve benefits provided by treatments and possibly lead to prevention of AD. We report the development of PET radiotracer methods for beta-amyloid plaques and tangles, nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors, serotonin 5HT1A receptors, dopamine D2/D3 receptors and norepinephrine transporters for the study of AD. This multi-target approach is currently being evaluated in AD transgenic mice models. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Human adult and adolescent biodistribution and dosimetry of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A radioligand <SUP>11</SUP>C-UCB-J	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Dosimetry; Carbon-11; SV2A; UCB-J; Adolescent		The ability to quantify synaptic density in vivo in human adults and adolescents is of vital importance to understanding neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we performed whole-body scans to determine organ radiation dosimetry of C-11-UCB-J in humans. Methods: Dynamic whole-body PET scans were performed in four healthy adults after injection of C-11-UCB-J. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn manually for the brain, heart, stomach, kidneys, liver, pancreas, spleen, gallbladder, lungs, urinary bladder, and intestines. ROIs were applied to dynamic images to generate time-activity curves (TACs). Decay correction was removed from TACs, and the area under the curve (AUC) for each ROI was calculated. AUCs were then normalized by injected activity and organ volumes to produce radioligand residence times for each organ. These times were then used as input into the OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software to determine the total radiation dose in each organ and the effective dose for these OLINDA models: 55-kg female, 70-kg male, and 15-year-old adolescent. Results: Visual evaluation detected high uptake in the liver, brain, gallbladder, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary bladder. The dose-limiting organ was the urinary bladder for adult males (0.0224 mSv/MBq) and liver for adult females (0.0248 mSv/MBq) with single-study dose limits of 2239 MBq and 2017 MBq C-11-UCB-J, respectively. For adolescents, the large intestine was the dose-limiting organ (0.0266 mSv/MBq) with a single-study dose limit of 188 MBq. Conclusions: C-11-UCB-J dosimetry in adults is consistent with those for many carbon-11-labeled ligands. Overall, C-11-UCB-J can be used safely in adolescents, as in adults, to measure synaptic density in various neuropsychiatric and other relevant disorders.

Quantifying inflammation with PET is a challenging and invasive procedure, especially in frail patients, because it requires blood sampling from an arterial catheter. A widely used alternative to arterial sampling is a supervised clustering algorithm (SVCA), which identifies the voxels with minimal specific binding in the PET images, thus extracting a reference region for noninvasive kinetic modeling. Methods: We tested this algorithm on a large population of subjects injected with the translocator protein radioligand C-11-PBR28 and compared the kinetic modeling results obtained with the gold standard of arterial input function (V-T/f(p)) with those obtained by SVCA (distribution volume ratio [DVR] with Logan plot). The study comprised 57 participants (21 healthy controls, 11 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 25 AD patients). Results: We found that V-T/f(p) was greater in AD patients than in controls in the inferior parietal, combined middle and inferior temporal, and entorhinal cortices. SVCA-DVR identified increased binding in the same regions and in an additional one, the parahippocampal region. We noticed however that the average amplitude of the reference curve obtained from subjects with genetic high-affinity binding for C-11-PBR28 was significantly larger than that from subjects with moderate affinity. This suggests that the reference curve extracted by SVCA was contaminated by specific binding. Conclusion: SVCA allows the noninvasive quantification of inflammatory biomarker translocator protein measured with C-11-PBR28 but without the need of arterial sampling. Although the reference curves were contaminated with specific binding, the decreased variance of the outcome measure, SVCA DVR, allowed for an apparent greater sensitivity to detect regional abnormalities in brains of patients with AD.

Kinetics of human cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptor antagonists: Structure-kinetics relationships (SKR) and implications for insurmountable antagonism	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Residence time; Structure-kinetics relationships; Cannabinoid 1 receptor; Insurmountable antagonism; Radioligand binding; Preincubation	ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; ADENOSINE A(1); ALLOSTERIC INTERACTIONS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BINDING-KINETICS; LIGANDS; DISSOCIATION; ASSOCIATION; DERIVATIVES; INHIBITION	While equilibrium binding affinities and in vitro functional antagonism of CB1 receptor antagonists have been studied in detail, little is known on the kinetics of their receptor interaction. In this study, we therefore conducted kinetic assays for nine 1-(4,5-diarylthiophene-2-carbonyl)-4-phenylpiperidine-4-carboxa mide derivatives and included the CB1 antagonist rimonabant as a comparison. For this we newly developed a dual-point competition association assay with [H-3]CP55940 as the radioligand. This assay yielded Kinetic Rate Index (KRI) values from which structure-kinetics relationships (SKR) of hCB1 receptor antagonists could be established. The fast dissociating antagonist 6 had a similar receptor residence time (RT) as rimonabant, i.e. 19 and 14 min, respectively, while the slowest dissociating antagonist (9) had a very long RT of 2222 min, i.e. pseudo-irreversible dissociation kinetics. In functional assays, 9 displayed insurmountable antagonism, while the effects of the shortest RT antagonist 6 and rimonabant were surmountable. Taken together, this study shows that hCB1 receptor antagonists can have very divergent RTs, which are not correlated to their equilibrium affinities. Furthermore, their RTs appear to define their mode of functional antagonism, i.e. surmountable vs. insurmountable. Finally, based on the recently resolved hCB1 receptor crystal structure, we propose that the differences in RT can be explained by a different binding mode of antagonist 9 from short RT antagonists that is able to displace unfavorable water molecules. Taken together, these findings are of importance for future design and evaluation of potent and safe hCB1 receptor antagonists. 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Materials and Methods: Patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer who experienced treatment failure with chemotherapy and novel androgen receptor targeted therapy were treated for 8 weeks with up to 4 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T. We report safety data, the antitumor response with prostate specific antigen decreases and the radiographic tumor response as well as the clinical outcome with changes in ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status and pain severity. Results: The first 3 patients were treated with a lower activity of 3.7 GBq in cycle 1. Due to a favorable safety profile the activity was increased to 7.4 GBq in 19 subsequent patients who completed a total of 40 cycles. With the higher activity no grade 3/4 toxicities were observed. The main nonhematological and hematological grade 1/2 toxicities were dry mouth in 7 patients (37%), anemia in 6 (32%) and thrombopenia in 5 (25%). The proportion of patients who achieved a maximum prostate specific antigen decrease of 30% or greater, 50% or greater and 90% or greater was 56%, 33% and 11%, respectively. Combined assessment of bone and soft tissue metastases showed complete remission in 5% of patients, stable disease in 63% and progressive disease in 32%. ECOG performance status improved or was stable in 74% of patients. Of men with bone pain 58% achieved complete resolution or reduced pain. Conclusions: Radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-I&T appears to be safe and active in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.

Allosteric Modulation of K<sub>v</sub>11.1 (hERG) Channels Protects Against Drug-Induced Ventricular Arrhythmias	CIRCULATION-ARRHYTHMIA AND ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						arrhythmias; cardiac; cardiotoxicity; cell culture techniques; myocytes; cardiac; potassium voltage-gated channel; subfamily H; member 2; radioligand assay; voltage-sensitive dye imaging	QT-INTERVAL PROLONGATION; MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS; POTASSIUM CHANNEL; CARDIAC MYOCYTE; K+ CHANNELS; DE-POINTES; RADIOLIGAND; RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGY; INHIBITION	Background Ventricular arrhythmias as a result of unintentional blockade of the K(v)11.1 (hERG [human ether-a-go-go-related gene]) channel are a major safety concern in drug development. In past years, several highly prescribed drugs have been withdrawn for their ability to cause such proarrhythmia. Here, we investigated whether the proarrhythmic risk of existing drugs could be reduced by K(v)11.1 allosteric modulators. Methods and Results Using [H-3]dofetilide-binding assays with membranes of human K(v)11.1-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells, 2 existing compounds (VU0405601 and ML-T531) and a newly synthesized compound (LUF7244) were found to be negative allosteric modulators of dofetilide binding to the K(v)11.1 channel, with LUF7244 showing the strongest effect at 10 mol/L. The K(v)11.1 affinities of typical blockers (ie, dofetilide, astemizole, sertindole, and cisapride) were significantly decreased by LUF7244. Treatment of confluent neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM) monolayers with astemizole or sertindole caused heterogeneous prolongation of action potential duration and a high incidence of early afterdepolarizations on 1-Hz electric point stimulation, occasionally leading to unstable, self-terminating tachyarrhythmias. Pretreatment of NRVMs with LUF7244 prevented these proarrhythmic effects. NRVM monolayers treated with LUF7244 alone displayed electrophysiological properties indistinguishable from those of untreated NRVM cultures. Prolonged exposure of NRVMs to LUF7244 or LUF7244 plus astemizole did not affect their viability, excitability, and contractility as assessed by molecular, immunological, and electrophysiological assays. Conclusions Allosteric modulation of the K(v)11.1 channel efficiently suppresses drug-induced ventricular arrhythmias in vitro by preventing potentially arrhythmogenic changes in action potential characteristics, raising the possibility to resume the clinical use of unintended K(v)11.1 blockers via pharmacological combination therapy.

In this study, we extend SAR for nisoxetine and talopram as parent compounds, to identify high affinity rhodamine-labeled fluorescent probes for the norepinephrine transporter (NET). Nisoxetine-based fluorescent probe 6 demonstrated high binding affinity (K-i = 43 nM) for NET and an overall selectivity compared to the other transporters for dopamine (DAT; K-i = 1540 nM) and serotonin (SERT; K-i = 785 nM) in competitive radioligand binding assays. Using confocal microscopy, compound 6 was shown to stain both NET and SERT, but not DAT, at low nanomolar concentrations, in transporter-expressing cells.

In this study, a series of natural and synthetic flavones and flavonols was assayed in vitro for their ability to inhibit radioligand binding at human cloned M-1 muscarinic receptors. Several compounds were found to possess competitive binding affinity (K-i = 40-110 mu M), comparable to that of acetylcholine (K-i = 59 mu M). Despite the fact that these compounds lack a positively-charged ammonium group under physiological conditions, molecular modelling studies suggested that they bind to the orthosteric site of the receptor, mainly through non-polar interactions.

In addition, some allosteric ligands exhibit 'absolute subtype selectivity'; action at one subtype but no action at any concentration at other subtypes. Some allosteric ligands also have pharmacological actions in the absence of orthosteric ligands and can act as inverse agonists or agonists in their own right by modulating constitutive activity. Examples of the novel pharmacological aspects and mechanisms of the actions of a number of allosteric ligands on muscarinic and adenosine A(1) receptors are described.

Radioligand binding parameters of the tachykinins were determined at a neurokinin receptor in a heterologous expression system. The correlation between binding, signaling and receptor regulation was investigated. A correlation between receptor binding and signaling was found between the peptides; however, their ability to produce desensitization was not correlated with binding and signaling. These results show that the ability of a tachykinin peptide to induce signal activation is not indicative of its ability to induce receptor regulation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

Quantification of the loss of noradrenergic neurons by means of neuroimaging has been limited by the lack of radio-ligands that are selective for noradrenergic neurotransmission. The radioligand (S, S)-C-11-2-(alpha-(2-methoxyphenoxy) benzyl) morpholine (C-11-MeNER) is a highly selective inhibitor of noradrenaline transporters, and PET studies suggest that this radioligand is suitable for quantitative neuroimaging of noradrenergic deficits in human brain in vivo. In the present investigation, we used PET with C-11-MeNER to map the density of noradrenaline transporters in groups of patients with PD and age-matched healthy controls. Methods: After administration of C-11-MeNER, 15 non-demented patients with PD and 10 healthy subjects underwent 90-min dynamic PET. We determined C-11-MeNER binding potential relative to nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) by multilinear analysis, simplified reference tissue model 2, and multilinear reference tissue model 2. Results: Metabolism of C-11-MeNER did not differ between groups. The simplified reference tissue model 2 and the multilinear reference tissue model 2 were used to determine C-11-MeNER BPND. C-11-MeNER BPND was reduced in the PD group compared with the control subjects, with regionally significant declines in the thalamus and nucleus ruber. Tremor was associated with higher tracer binding in the PD group on multivariate regression analysis. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this was the first specific quantification of noradrenergic denervation in PD patients in vivo. In agreement with predictions from determinations in vitro, we discovered a decline of noradrenergic projections in vivo in brain of PD patients.

To mitigate the challenge posed by translating target interaction across species and balancing beneficial vs. adverse effects, a positron emission tomography (PET) approach could help guide clinical dose optimization. Thus, as part of a compound differentiation effort, three novel selective CB1 receptor (CB1R) antagonists, developed by AstraZeneca (AZ) for the treatment of obesity, were compared with two clinically tested reference compounds, rimonabant and taranabant, with regard to receptor occupancy relative to dose and exposure. A total of 42 PET measurements were performed in 6 non-human primates using the novel CB1R antagonist radioligand [C-11]SD5024. The AZ CB1R antagonists bound in a saturable manner to brain CBIR with in vivo affinities similar to that of rimonabant and taranabant, compounds with proven weight loss efficacy in clinical trials. Interestingly, it was found that exposures corresponding to those needed for. optimal clinical efficacy of rimonabant and taranabant resulted in a CB1R occupancy typically around similar to 20-30%, thus much lower than what would be expected for classical G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) antagonists in other therapeutic contexts. These findings are also discussed in relation to emerging literature on the potential usefulness of 'neutral' vs. 'classical' CB1R (inverse agonist) antagonists. The study additionally highlighted the usefulness of the radioligand [C-11]SD5024 as a specific tracer for CB1R in the primate brain, though an arterial input function would ideally be required in future studies to further assure accurate quantitative analysis of specific binding.

Here, we investigated effects of BK and its antagonists on chondrocytes, cells involved in cartilage homeostasis. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH BK receptor density and affinities of BK, its analogues and antagonists were measured in cultured human and rat chondrocytes by radioligand binding. Effects of BK were assessed by accumulation of inositol phosphates (IP) and release of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8. KEY RESULTS Density of [3H]-BK binding sites was higher (13-30-fold) and BK evoked a greater (48-fold) IP production, in human than in rat chondrocytes. The BK B-2 receptor antagonists MEN16132 and icatibant displayed similar binding affinity. MEN16132 was 40-fold more potent than icatibant in the IP assay. In human chondrocytes, BK increased release (over 24 h) of IL-6 and IL-8, effects blocked by MEN16132 but not by the B-1 receptor antagonist Lys-[Leu8][desArg9]BK. BK-induced release of IL-6, but not of IL-8, was partially inhibited by indomethacin (10 mu M) and nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10 mu M). Antagonists for the prostanoid EP receptors (AH6809 10 mu M; L-798 196, 200 nM; L-161 982, 1 mu M) were ineffective. Dexamethasone (100 nM) partially inhibited release of both IL-6 and IL-8. Inhibitors of intracellular downstream signalling pathways (SB203580 10 mu M; PD98059, 30 mu M; SP600125, 30 mu M; BAY-117085, 5 mu M) indicated the involvement of p38 MAPK and the activation of NF-kappa B. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS BK mediated inflammatory changes and cartilage degradation and B-2 receptor blockade would, therefore, be a potential treatment for OA.

In this study, a norepinephrine transporter was visualized in the human brain using this radioligand with PET and quantified by several methods. Methods: PET scans were performed on 10 healthy men after intravenous injection of (S,S)-(FFMeNER)-F-18-D-2. Binding potential relative to nondisplaceable binding (BPND) was quantified by the indirect kinetic, simplified reference-tissue model (SRTM), multilinear reference-tissue model (MRTM), and ratio methods. The indirect kinetic method was used as the gold standard and was compared with the SRTM method with scan times of 240 and 180 min, the MRTM method with a scan time of 240 min, and the ratio method with a time integration interval of 120-180 min. The caudate was used as reference brain region. Results: Regional radioactivity was highest in the thalamus and lowest in the caudate during PET scanning. BPND values by the indirect kinetic method were 0.54 +/- 0.19 and 0.35 +/- 0.25 in the thalamus and locus coeruleus, respectively. BPND values found by the SRTM, MRTM, and ratio methods agreed with the values demonstrated by the indirect kinetic method (r = 0.81-0.92). Conclusion: The regional distribution of (S,S)-F-18-FMeNER-D-2 in our study agreed with that demonstrated by previous PET and postmortem studies of norepinephrine transporter in the human brain. The ratio method with a time integration interval of 120-180 min will be useful for clinical research of psychiatric disorders for estimation of norepinephrine transporter occupancy by antidepressants without requiring arterial blood sampling and dynamic PET.

We report the absorbed radiation dosimetry of i.v.-administered C-11-NMB, a critical step before applying this radioligand to imaging studies in humans. Materials and methods Whole-body PET imaging with a CTI/Siemens ECAT 953B scanner was done in a male and a female baboon. After i.v. injection of 444-1221 MBq of C-11-NMB, sequential images taken from the head to the pelvis were collected for 3 h. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were identified that entirely encompassed small organs (whole brain, striatum, eyes, and myocardium). Large organs (liver, lungs, kidneys, lower large intestine, and urinary bladder) were sampled by drawing representative regions within the organ volume. Time-activity curves for each VOI were extracted from the PET, and organ residence times were calculated by analytical integration of a multi-exponential fit of the time-activity curves. Human radiation doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 and the standard human model. Results Highest retention was observed in the blood and liver, each with total residence times of 1.5 min. The highest absorbed radiation doses were to the heart (10.5 mGy/kBq) and kidney ( 9.19 mGy/kBq), making these the critical organs for [C-11]NMB. A heart absorption of 50 mGy would result from an injected dose of 4,762 MBq [C-11]NMB. Conclusions Thus, this study suggests that up to 4,762 MBq of [C-11]NMB can be safely administered to human subjects for PET studies. Total body dose and effective dose for [C-11]NMB are 2.82 mGy/kBq and 3.7 mSv/kBq, respectively.

Materials and methods Competition radioligand binding studies were performed with trazodone in human penile tissue and in cell lines stably expressing all cloned human alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes. Results Trazodone had higher affinity for human alpha(1)-adrenoceptors (10-130 nmol/L) than for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors (300-700 nmol/L), but did not discriminate between subtypes of human alpha(1)- or alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Conclusion Trazodone has high and moderate affinity for human alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, respectively; this might contribute to its reported beneficial effects in erectile dysfunction.

In this paper, we demonstrate the regioselective conversion of readily available pyridine N-oxides into 2-pyridyltrialkylammonium salts under mild and metal-free conditions. These isolable intermediates serve as effective precursors to structurally diverse 2-fluoropyridines, including molecules relevant to PET imaging. In addition to providing access to nonradioactive analogues, this method has been successfully applied to 18F-labeling in the radiosynthesis of [F-18]AV-1451 ([F-18]T807), a PET tracer currently under development for imaging tau.

The development of a selective radioligand that will enable in vivo imaging and quantification of 5-HT2CR densities represents a significant technological advancement in understanding both the normal function and pathophysiology of the 5-HT2CR. Four 7-halogen-2-phenyl isoindolones (7-F, Cl, Br, I) were synthesized and displayed high affinities for 5-HT2CR and high selectivity over 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B. [C-11]7-Chloro-2-[4-methoxy-3-[2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenyl]isoindolin-1-one (6) and [C-11]7-iodo-2-[4-methoxy-3-[2-(4-methylpiperidin-1-yl)ethoxy]phenyl]isoindolin-1-one (9) were synthesized in high radiochemical yield of 37-44% [n = 10, decay corrected from end of (C-11)CH3I synthesis] with high radiochemical purity via O-methylation with [C-11]CH3I, respectively. MicroPET imaging studies in male rats with or without 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084 showed that [C-11]6 and [C-11]9 display specific bindings to 5-HT2CR in the choroid plexus and hippocampus. In vivo microPET brain imaging studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrated that [C-11]6 and [C-11]9 exhibit excellent blood-brain barrier penetration. The contrast of bindings to the choroid plexus and hippocampus compared to the cerebellum peaked at 2.7 and 1.6, respectively, for [C-11]6, and 3.7 and 2.7, respectively, for [C-11]9, which were reduced by administration of a dose of SB-242084. Our results support the candidacy of [C-11]6 and [C-11]9 for further study as radioligands for in vivo quantitation of 5-HT2C sites by PET.

Detecting neuroinflammation in the brain following chronic alcohol exposure in rats: A comparison between in vivo and in vitro TSPO radioligand binding	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						18-kDa translocator protein; alcohol dependence; autoradiography; microglia; PBR28; PK11195; positron emission tomography	PROTEIN 18 KDA; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS; ETHANOL WITHDRAWAL; HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS; PROTOPORPHYRIN IX; MESSENGER-RNA	Excessive alcohol consumption is associated with neuroinflammation, which likely contributes to alcohol-related pathology. However, positron emission tomography (PET) studies using radioligands for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is considered a biomarker of neuroinflammation, reported decreased binding in alcohol use disorder (AUD) participants compared to controls. In contrast, autoradiographic findings in alcohol exposed rats reported increases in TSPO radioligand binding. To assess if these discrepancies reflected differences between in vitro and in vivo methodologies, we compared in vitro autoradiography (using [H-3]PBR28 and [H-3]PK11195) with in vivo PET (using [C-11]PBR28) in male, Wistar rats exposed to chronic alcohol-vapor (dependent n = 10) and in rats exposed to air-vapor (nondependent n = 10). PET scans were obtained with [C-11]PBR28, after which rats were euthanized and the brains were harvested for autoradiography with [H-3]PBR28 and [H-3]PK11195 (n = 7 dependent and n = 7 nondependent), and binding quantified in hippocampus, thalamus, and parietal cortex. Autoradiography revealed significantly higher binding in alcohol-dependent rats for both radioligands in thalamus and hippocampus (trend level for [H-3]PBR28) compared to nondependent rats, and these group differences were stronger for [H-3]PK11195 than [H-3]PBR28. In contrast, PET measures obtained in the same rats showed no group difference in [C-11]PBR28 binding. Our in vitro data are consistent with neuroinflammation associated with chronic alcohol exposure. Failure to observe similar increases in [C-11]PBR28 binding in vivo suggests the possibility that a mechanism mediated by chronic alcohol exposure interferes with [C-11]PBR28 binding to TSPO in vivo. These data question the sensitivity of PBR28 PET as a methodology to assess neuroinflammation in AUD.

However, the mechanistic links between these lines of data are unknown. To identify molecular targets for specific GHB high-affinity binding, we undertook photolinking studies combined with proteomic analyses and identified several GABA(A) receptor subunits as possible candidates. A subsequent functional screening of various recombinant GABA(A) receptors in Xenopus laevis oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp technique showed GHB to be a partial agonist at alpha beta delta -but not alpha beta gamma-receptors, proving that the delta-subunit is essential for potency and efficacy. GHB showed preference for alpha 4 over alpha(1,2,6)-subunits and preferably activated alpha 4 beta 1 delta (EC50 = 140 nM) over alpha 4 beta (2/3)delta (EC50 = 8.41/1.03 mM). Introduction of a mutation, alpha 4F71L, in alpha 4 beta 1(delta)-receptors completely abolished GHB but not GABA function, indicating nonidentical binding sites. Radioligand binding studies using the specific GHB radioligand [H-3](E, RS)-(6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5-hydroxy-5H-benzocyclohept-6-ylidene)acetic acid showed a 39% reduction (P = 0.0056) in the number of binding sites in alpha 4 KO brain tissue compared with WT controls, corroborating the direct involvement of the alpha 4-subunit in high-affinity GHB binding. Our data link specific GHB forebrain binding sites with alpha 4-containing GABA(A) receptors and postulate a role for extrasynaptic alpha 4 delta-containing GABA(A) receptors in GHB pharmacology and physiology. This finding will aid in elucidating the molecular mechanisms behind the proposed function of GHB as a neurotransmitter and its unique therapeutic effects in narcolepsy and alcoholism.

Each of the main compound classes, derived from thioflavin T (PIB), Congo Red (BSB), and aminonaphthalene (FDDNP) are believed to bind to mutually exclusive sites on the beta-amyloid (A beta) peptide fibrils. We recently reported the presence of three classes of binding sites (BS1, BS2, BS3) on the A beta fibrils for thioflavin T derivatives and now extend these findings to demonstrate that these sites are also able to accommodate ligands from the other chemotype classes. The results from competition assays using [3H]Me-BTA-1 (BS3 probe) indicated that both PIB and FDDNP were able to displace the radioligand with K-i values of 25 and 42 nM, respectively. BSB was unable to displace the radioligand tracer from the A beta fibrils. In contrast, each of the compounds examined were able to displace thioflavin T ( BS1 probe) from the A beta fibrils when evaluated in a fluorescence competition assay with Ki values for PIB, FDDNP, and BSB of 1865, 335, and 600 nM, respectively. Finally, the K-d values for FDDNP and BSB binding to A beta fibrils were directly determined by monitoring the increases in the ligand intrinsic fluorescence, which were 290 and 104 nM, respectively. The results from these assays indicate that (i) the three classes of thioflavin T binding sites are able to accommodate a wide range of chemotype structures, (ii) BSB binds to two sites on the A beta fibrils, one of which is BS2, and the other is distinct from the thioflavin T derivative binding sites, and (iii) there is no independent binding site on the fibrils for FDDNP, and the ligand binds to both the BS1 and BS3 sites with significantly lower affinities than previously reported.

Recently, a receptor-specific radioligand for in vivo imaging of the ER in breast cancer patients was developed: (123)\-labeled cis-11beta-methoxy-17alpha-iodovinyl-estradiol (Z-I-123-MIVE). It showed high sensitivity and specificity for the in vivo detection of ER-positive breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine whether Z-I-123-MIVE scintigraphy is able to predict response or resistance to antiestrogen therapy in patients with metastatic ER-positive breast carcinoma. Methods: Twenty-three patients with first metastases of their breast cancer and positive Z-I-123-MIVE scintigraphy were included and treated with tamoxifen, 40 mg/d. Scintigraphy was repeated, on average, 4 wk later. The results of these scintigraphies were compared with the clinical outcome. Results: On baseline scintigraphy, 21 of 23 patients had clear uptake and 2 of 23 patients had faint uptake of Z-I-123-MIVE. After initiation of antiestrogen treatment, 17 of 21 patients with clear uptake on baseline scintigraphy showed complete blockade of ER activity on the Z-I-123-MIVE scintigraphy. Four of 21 patients showed mixed or no ER blockade. All patients with faint baseline uptake or mixed or no ER blockade after tamoxifen showed progressive disease despite antiestrogen treatment. Patients with clear baseline uptake and complete ER blockade after tamoxifen had a significantly longer progression-free interval (mean +/- SEM, 14.4 +/- 1.6 vs. 1.8 +/- 0.8 mo; P < 0.01). Conclusion: Z-I-123-MIVE scintigraphy seems to be a useful tool to predict response or resistance to antiestrogen treatment in ER-positive metastatic breast cancer patients and to depictnonresponders before the clinical manifestation of progression.

In this study, the allosteric modulation of human A(3) adenosine receptors by a series of 3-(2-pyridinyl)isoquinoline derivatives was investigated by examining their effects on the dissociation of the agonist radioligand, [I-125]N-6-(4-amino-3-iodobenzyl)-5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine (IAB-MECA), from the receptor. Several 3-(2-pyridinyl)isoquinoline derivatives, including VUF5455, VUF8502, VUF8504, and VUF8507, slowed the dissociation of the agonist radioligand [I-125]I-AB-MECA in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting an allosteric interaction. These compounds had no effect on the dissociation of the radiolabeled antagonist [H-3]PSB-11 from the A(3) adenosine receptor, suggesting a selective enhancement of agonist binding. By comparison, compounds of similar structure (VUF8501, VUF8503, VUF8505), the classical adenosine receptor antagonist CGS15943 and the A(1) receptor allosteric enhancer PD81723 did not significantly influence the dissociation rate of [I-125]I-AB-MECA. The effect of agonist on forskolin-induced cAMP production was significantly enhanced by VUF5455. When the subtype-selectivity of the allosteric enhancement was tested the compounds had no effect on the dissociation of either [H-3]N-6-[(R)-phenylisopropyl]adenosine from the A(1) adenosine receptor or [H-3]CGS21680 from the A(2A) adenosine receptor. Probing of structure-activity relationships suggested that a carbonyl group is essential for allosterism but preferred only for competitive antagonism. The presence of a 7-methyl group decreased the competitive binding affinity without a major loss of the allosteric enhancing activity, suggesting that the structural requirements for allosteric enhancement might be distinct from those for competitive antagonism.

Saturation experiments revealed a single high affinity binding site with K-D of 1.9 +/-0.2 nM and B-max of 1.3 +/-0.1 pniol mg(-1) of protein. 3 The pharmacological profile of [H-3]-MRE 3008F20 binding on Jurkat cells was established using typical adenosine ligands which displayed a rank order of potency typical of the A3 subtype. 4 Thermodynamic data indicated that [H-3]-MRE 3008F20 binding to A(3) subtype in Jurkat cells was entropy- and enthalpy-driven, according with that found in cells expressing the recombinant human A(3) subtype. 5 In functional assays the high affinity A(3) agonists Cl-IB-MECA and IB-MECA were able to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation and stimulate Ca2+ release from intracellular Ca2+ pools followed by Ca2+ influx. 6 The presence of the other adenosine subtypes was investigated in Jurkat cells. A(1) receptors were characterized using [H-3]-DPCPX binding with a K-D of 0.9 +/-0.1 nM and B-max of 42 +/-3 fmol mg(-1) of protein. A(2A) receptors were studied with [H-3]-SCH 58261 binding and revealed a K-D of 2.5 +/-0.3 nM and a B-max of 1.4 +/-0.2 pmol mg(-1) of protein. 7 In conclusion, by means of the first antagonist radioligand [H-3]-MRE 3008F20 we could demonstrate the existence of functional A(3) receptors on Jurkat cells.

J	Faber, JE; Yang, NY; Xin, XH				Faber, JE; Yang, NY; Xin, XH			Expression of α-adrenoceptor subtypes by smooth muscle cells and adventitial fibroblasts in rat aorta and in cell culture	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							MESSENGER-RNA; ALPHA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; ARTERIAL; TISSUES; PROTEIN; ALPHA(1D)-ADRENOCEPTORS; ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTORS; ANTAGONIST	Previous radioligand binding reports of vascular a-adrenoceptor (AR) density have been limited to total alpha (1)- or alpha (2)-ARs. Studies using whole blood vessel homogenates have not differentiated among receptor or mRNA expression by medial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) versus adventitial fibroblasts (AFBs). Therefore, we used quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and radioligand binding to measure a-AR subtypes in media, adventitia, and cultured SMCs and AFBs from rat aorta. Both media and adventitia expressed alpha (1A)-, alpha (1B)-, alpha (1D)-, and alpha (2D)-AR mRNAs, but in markedly different abundances. Total alpha (1)-AR density was the same for media and adventitia (B-max = 101 +/- 10 versus 96 +/- 16 fmol/mg of protein). However, densities for alpha (1A)-, alpha (1B)-, and alpha (1D)-AR subtypes in media were 19 +/-2, 26 +/-4, and 55 +/-2%, and in adventitia were 44 +/-3, 37 +/-5, and 19 +/-2%. No alpha (2B)- or alpha (2C)-AR transcripts were detected in either layer or in cultured SMCs or AFBs. Total alpha (1)-AR densities in cultured SMCs and AFBs (B-max = 111 +/-4 and 48 +/-6 fmol/mg of protein, respectively) were similar to media and adventitia, with alpha (1B)- and alpha (1D)-AR transcript levels and receptors largely sustained. However, alpha (1A)- and alpha (2D)-AR expression in cultured SMCs and AFBs was strongly reduced, compared with media and adventitia, an effect not prevented by 30 different culture conditions. Like SMCs, exposure of AFBs to norepinephrine induced protein synthesis and proliferation of AFBs. This is the first study to quantitate a-AR subtype expression in media and adventitia and in cultured SMCs and AFBs. In addition, we report the intriguing finding that AFBs express alpha (1)-ARs in similar abundance as medial SMCs and that norepinephrine induced them to proliferate.

KMUP 880723 (1.0 mg/kg, iv) also markedly inhibited both the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol and arterial pressor responses induced by phenylephrine. In the isolated Wistar rat right atria, left atria, and guinea pig tracheal strips, KMUP 880723 competitively antagonized the (-)isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic effects, inotropic effects, and tracheal relaxation effects in a concentration-dependent manner. The parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curve of (-)isoproterenol suggested that KMUP 880723 was a beta (1)/beta (2)-adrenoceptor competitive antagonist. The apparent pA(2) values were 6.89 +/-0.10 in the right atria, 7.02 +/-0.09 in the left atria, and 6.59 +/-0.11 in the trachea, indicating that KMUP 880723 was a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor blocker. In thoracic aorta experiments, KMUP 880723 also produced a competitive antagonism of norepinephrine-induced contraction with a pA(2) value of 7.14 +/-0.06. In isolated rat thoracic aorta, KMUP 880723 more potently relaxed the contractions induced by norepinephrine (3 x 10(-6) M) than those by high K- (75 mM). In the radioligand-binding assay, the pK(i) values of [H-3]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricle and lung membranes were 6.56 and 6.40, respectively, and the value of [H-3]prazosin binding to rat brain membranes was 6.66. These results further confirmed the alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blocking activities of KMUP 880723 reported in the functional studies. We conclude that KMUP 880723 is a nonselective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist with alpha-adrenoceptor blocking-associated vasorelaxant activity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We built the scaffolds of dibenzo[c,g], [c,f]- and -[d,f]azecines and together with their ring closed, more rigid precursors, evaluated the affinities for the human D-1-D-5 receptors (radioligand binding) as well as the functionalities (calcium assay) and thus investigated the influence of annelation and conformative flexibility of these compounds on their affinity for human cloned dopamine receptors.

Heterologous expression in CHO cells indicated species dependent in vitro pharmacological properties for the human and rhesus melanocortin-5 receptors. Several peptides including NDP-alpha-MSH, alpha-MSH, MT-II and ACTH1-24 are more potent at the rhesus melanocortin-5 receptor than the human melanocortin-5 receptor by more than 10-fold. In contrast, we found no species difference in pharmacological properties between the human and rhesus melanocortin-3 receptors. Such a species-dependent pharmacological difference for melanocortin-5 receptor appears to be an exception compared to other G protein-coupled receptors from human and rhesus monkey.

Comprehensive data for 27 are presented, including in vivo PK parameters, confirmation of receptor occupancy through ex vivo binding and efficacy in a rat sleep model. A key feature of the series is a short dissociation half-life, measured by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) using stabilized receptors, and confirmed by radioligand-binding experiments. Based on a consideration of the requirements for a potential treatment for insomnia, compound 27 was identified as having the best balance of properties from the chemical series.

Although all antipsychotics bound to both subtypes with relatively high affinity (K(i)s<74 nM), none were selective (>10-fold).

Pain-related opioidergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission: Dual meta-Analyses of PET radioligand studies	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						PET Radioligands; Pain modulation; Opioid receptor; Dopamine receptor; Reward system; Striatum	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; HUMAN BRAIN; SOCIAL REJECTION; SYSTEM; AMPHETAMINE; PLACEBO; RELEASE; AVAILABILITY; STIMULATION	Molecular mechanisms of the interaction between opioidergic and dopaminergic processing during pain-related experiences in the human brain are still incompletely understood. This is partially due to the invasive nature of the available techniques to visualize and measure metabolic activity. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) radioligand studies using radioactive substances are still the only available modality to date that allows for the investigation of the molecular mechanisms in the human brain. The most commonly studied PET radiotracers are [11C]-carfentanil (CFN) and [11C]-or [18F]-diprenorphine (DPN), which bind to opioid receptors, and [11C]-raclopride (RAC) and [18F]-fallypride (FAL) tracers, which bind to dopamine receptors. The current meta-analysis examines pain-related studies that used aforementioned opioid and dopamine radioligands in an effort to consolidate the available data into the most likely activated regions. Our primary goal was to identify regions of shared opioid/dopamine neurotransmission during pain-related experiences using within-subject approach. Seed-based d Mapping (SDM) analysis of previously published voxel coordinate data showed that opioidergic activations were strongest in the bilateral caudate, thalamus, right putamen, cingulate gyrus, midbrain, inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. The dopaminergic studies showed that the bilateral caudate, thalamus, right putamen, cingulate gyrus, and left putamen had the highest activations. We were able to see a clear overlap between opioid and dopamine activations in a majority of the regions during pain-related expe-riences, though there were some unique areas of dopaminergic activation such as the left putamen. Regions unique to opioidergic activation included the midbrain, inferior frontal gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus. Here we provide initial evidence for the functional overlap between opioidergic and dopaminergic processing during aversive states in humans.

Agonist-induced desensitization of human β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptors expressed in human embryonic kidney cells	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						beta(3)-adrenoceptor; G protein; Adenylyl cyclase; Desensitization; Human embryonic kidney cell; L 748,337	RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; DIFFERENTIAL DOWN-REGULATION; BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; PROLONGED INVIVO INFUSION; PERTUSSIS TOXIN; BETA-2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; HUMAN BETA(2)-ADRENOCEPTOR; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; RESPONSES	beta(3)-Adrenoceptors are resistant to agonist-induced desensitization in some cell types but susceptible in others including transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Therefore, we have studied cellular and molecular changes involved in agonist-induced beta(3)-adrenoceptor desensitization in HEK cells. Cells were treated with isoprenaline or forskolin, and following wash-out, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation in response to freshly added agonist was quantified. Receptor and G protein expression were quantified by radioligand binding and immunoblot experiments, respectively. Treatment with isoprenaline induced a concentration- and time-dependent desensitization of cAMP accumulation in response to freshly added isoprenaline. This functional desensitization primarily consisted of reduced maximum responses with little change of agonist potency. Maximum desensitization was achieved by pre-treatment with 10 mu M isoprenaline for 24 h. It was not accompanied by changes in beta(3)-adrenoceptor density as assessed in saturation radioligand-binding studies. The desensitization was associated with a small reduction in immunoreactivity for alpha-subunits for G(s) and G(i1), whereas that for G(i2), G(i3), and G(q/11) was not significantly altered. In cells treated with pertussis toxin, isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation as well as desensitization by isoprenaline pre-treatment remained unchanged. Isoprenaline pre-treatment also reduced forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation; conversely, pre-treatment with forskolin caused a similar desensitization of isoprenaline-induced cAMP accumulation. We conclude that agonist-induced beta(3)-adrenoceptor desensitization in HEK cells does not involve reduced receptor numbers and small, if any, reduction of G(s) expression; changes at the level of adenylyl cyclase function can fully explain this desensitization.

The aim of this study was to characterize the receptors responsible for direct motor responses induced by kinins on human detrusor. Experimental approach: Human detrusor cells from biopsies were isolated and mantained in culture. B-1 and B-2 kinin receptors were characterized by means of radioligand and functional experiments (PI accumulation and PGE(2) release). Key results: [H-3]-[desArg(9)]-Lys-BK and [H-3]-BK saturation studies indicated receptor density (B-max) and K-d values of 19 or 113 fmol mg(-1), and 0.16 or 0.11 nM for the B-1 or B-2 receptors, respectively. Inhibition binding studies indicated the selectivity of the B-1 receptor antagonist [desArg(9)Leu(8)]-Lys-BK and of the B-2 receptor antagonists Icatibant and MEN16132. [DesArg(9)]Lys-BK and BK induced PI accumulation with an EC50 of 1.6 and 1.4 nM and different maximal responses (E-max of [desArg(9)]Lys-BK was 10% of BK). BK also induced prostaglandin E-2 release (EC50 2.3 nM), whereas no response was detected with the B-1 receptor agonist. The incubation of detrusor smooth muscle cells with interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) or tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (10 ng ml(-1)) induced a time-dependent increase in radioligand-specific binding, which was greater for the B-1 than for the B-2 receptor. Conclusions and Implications: Human detrusor smooth muscle cells in culture retain kinin receptors, and represent a suitable model to investigate the mechanisms and changes that occur under chronic inflammatory conditions.

The aim was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of different immunoglobulin isotypes against tTG. Methods: Immunoglobulin A (IgA)-tTG, IgG-tTG, and IgGl-tTG were measured in radioligand binding assays in 67 children with untreated and 89 children with treated CD and compared with 48 biopsy controls. IgM-tTG was measured in children with untreated CD and in biopsy controls. IgA endomysial autoantibodies (EMA) were analyzed in all children using an immunofluorescence method. Results: The sensitivity of IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG was 85.1% (57 of 67) and 83.6% (56 of 67), respectively, which both increased to 93.8% (45 of 48) in children diagnosed at age 2 years or older. Both had a specificity of 93.8% (45 of 48). IgA-EMA had a sensitivity of 80.6% (54 of 67) and a specificity of 91.7% (44 of 48). In treated CD, IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG were detected in 21.3% (19 of 89) and in 14.6% (13 of 89), respectively, despite negative EMA titers. IgGl-tTG was correlated to age (r = -0.47, P = 0.0005) and detected in 50.7% (34 of 67) with untreated CD compared with 11.2% (10 of 89) with treated CD and with 4.2% (2 of 48) of biopsy controls (P < 0.0001, respectively). IgM-tTG was detected in 1.5% (1 of 67) with untreated CD and in none of biopsy controls. Conclusion: IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG analyzed in radioligand binding assays are equivalent to IgA-EMA as screening tests for CD during childhood, but an intestinal biopsy is still the method of choice to establish the diagnosis. Although IgGl-tTG was more common at young age of diagnosis, both IgGl-tTG and IgM-tTG had low specificity and sensitivity and may not be useful as screening tests for CD.

In our first effort to provide PET ligands for the NMDA/glycine site, we reported the synthesis of a novel high affinity glycine site ligand, 3-[2-[(3-methoxyphenylamino)carbonyl]ethenyl]-4,6-dichloroindole-2-carboxylic acid ((3MPICA), Ki = 4.8 +/- 0.9 nM) and the corresponding carbon-11 labeled PET ligand, [C-11]3MPICA. We report here the in vivo evaluation of [C-11]3MPICA in rats. Biodistribution analysis revealed that [C-11]3MPICA exhibited low degree of brain penetration and high blood concentration. The average uptake at two minutes was highest in the cerebellum (0.19 +/- 0.04 %ID/g) and thalamus (0.18 +/- 0.05 %ID/g) and lower in the hippocarnpus (0.13 +/- 0.03) and frontal cortex (0.11 +/- 0.04 %ID/g). The radioactivity cleared quickly from all brain regions examined. Administration of unlabeled 3MPICA (1 mg/kg, i.v.) revealed at 60 minutes a small general reduction in regional brain radioactivity concentrations in treated animals versus controls, however, the blood radioactivity concentration was also lowered, confounding the assessment of the degree of saturable binding. Warfarin co-administration (100 mg/kg, i.v.) significantly lowered blood activity at 5 minutes post-injection (-27%, P < 0.01) but failed to significantly increase the brain uptake of the radiotracer. In view of these results, and especially considering the low brain penetration of this tracer, [C-11]3MPICA does not appear to be a promising PET radiotracer for in vivo use.

In homogenates of human left ventricle, I-125-[Sar(1),lle(8)]angiotensin II bound with subnanomolar affinity, with a corresponding K-D of 0.42+/-0.09 nM, a B-max of 11.2+/-2.3 fmol (.) mg(-1) protein and a Hill slope of 1.04+/-0.04. The rank order of inhibitory potency of competing ligands for the I-125-[Sar(1),lle8]angiotensin II binding site was CGP42112 > angiotensin II greater than or equal to angiotensin III = angiotensin I > losartan. The angiotensin type II (AT(2)) receptor predominated in the human left ventricle over the angiotensin type I (AT(1)) receptor, with an approximate AT(1)/AT(2) receptor ratio of 35:65. No specific (125)1-angiotensin IV binding sites could be detected in the human left ventricle. Using competitive radioligand binding assays, we were able to demonstrate that the chymase/cathepsin G enzyme inhibitor chymostatin was more potent than the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor captopril at inhibiting the conversion of angiotensin I in the human left ventricle. Aprotonin (an inhibitor of cathepsin G but of not chymase) had no effect on angiotensin I conversion, suggesting that the majority of the conversion was mediated by chymase. Thus, although the current therapies used for the renin-angiotensin system have focused on ACE inhibitors and AT, receptor antagonists, the left ventricle of the human heart expresses mainly AT(2) receptors and the tissue-specific conversion of angiotensin I occurs predominantly via chymase rather than ACE.

Taricha granulosa, the roughskin newt, was used here to characterize an amphibian cannabinoid receptor. Behavioral experiments demonstrated that the cannabinoid agonist levonantradol inhibits both newt spontaneous locomotor activity and courtship clasping behavior, Inhibition of clasping was dose-dependent and potent (IC50 = 1.2 mu g per animal). Radioligand binding studies using [H-3]CP-55940 allowed identification of a specific binding site (K-D = 6.5 nM, B-max = 1,853 fmol/mg of protein) in brain membranes. Rank order of affinity of several ligands was consistent with that reported for mammalian species (K-D, nM): CP-55940 (3.8) > levonantradol (13.0) > WIN55212-2 (25.7) much greater than anandamide (1,665) approximate to anandamide + 100 mu M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2,398). The cDNA encoding the newt CB1 cannabinoid receptor was cloned, and the corresponding mRNA of 5.9 kb was found to be highly expressed in brain. A nonclonal Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably expressing the newt CB1 cannabinoid receptor was prepared that allowed demonstration of cannabinoid-mediated inhibition of adenylate cyclase (EC 4.6.1.1) activity. This inhibition was dose-dependent and occurred at concentrations consistent with affinities determined through radioligand binding experiments. The behavioral, pharmacological, and molecular cloning results demonstrate that a CB1 cannabinoid receptor is expressed in the CNS of the roughskin newt. This amphibian CB1 is very similar in density, ligand binding affinity, ligand binding specificity, and amino acid sequence to mammalian CB1. The high degree of evolutionary conservation of cannabinoid signaling systems implies an important physiological role in vertebrate brain function.

The in vitro effects of (R)-BM-5 were also studied in anaesthetised cat. No receptor or tissue selectivity was found for either enantiomer in radioligand binding studies in cells expressing human muscarinic receptors (M-1-M-5) or in guinea pig tissues. The affinity of (R)-BM-5 was about 40 times, or 15-60 times higher than that of (S)-BM-5 in recombinant cells or in guinea pig tissues, respectively. Both enantiomers induced contraction of the guinea pig isolated urinary bladder and ileum. (R)-BM-5 was more potent than (S)-BM-5 in bladder (EC50 590 and 3500 nM, respectively) and in ileum (EC50 39 and 2600 nM, respectively). The maximal agonist effect was lower for (R)-BM-5 than for (S)-BM-5 in bladder (2.7% and 6.6%, respectively) and in ileum (32% and 48%, respectively). Contractions were completely inhibited by atropine (1 mu M). In vivo, (R)-BM-5 induced bladder contraction and salivation after intravenous administration in the anaesthetised car (ED50 4.1 and 6.2 mu g kg(-1), respectively). In conclusion, (R)- and (S)-BM-5 act as partial muscarinic agonists in the isolated bladder and ileum. (R)-BM-5 was the more potent enantiomer but had a lower maximal agonist effect giving an opposed enantioselectivity for affinity and efficacy. (R)-BM-5 showed agonist activity in vivo, confirming in vitro findings. From affinity and efficacy data it can be concluded that the effects of racemic BM-5 are mediated by the (R)-enantiomer.

Most carbon-11 labels, however, are installed using derivative reagents generated from [C-11]CO2. In recent years, [C-11]CO2 has seen a revival in applications for the direct incorporation of carbon-11 into functional groups such as ureas, carbamates, oxazolidinones, carboxylic acids, esters, and amides. This review summarizes classical [C-11]CO2 fixation strategies using organometallic reagents and then focuses on newly developed methods that employ strong organic bases to reversibly capture [C-11]CO2 into solution, thereby enabling highly functionalized labelled compounds to be prepared. Labelled compounds and radiopharmaceuticals that have been translated to the clinic are highlighted.

We here report the preparation of two candidate 5-HT1A radioligands, [11C]AZ11132132 ([11C]3) and [11C]AZ11895530 ([11C]4), and their subsequent evaluation in vitro using autoradiography and in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). Compounds 3 and 4 were radiolabeled at high radiochemical purity (>99%) and high molar activity (>38 GBq/mu mol) by heteroatom methylation with [11C]methyl iodide. Autoradiography on whole hemispheres from post-mortem human brain revealed substantial nonspecific binding of [11C]3, while the binding of [11C]4 to brain tissue was consistent with the distribution of 5-HT1A receptors and sensitive to co-incubation with the reference 5-HT1A antagonist WAY100635 (10 mu M). Following intravenous injection of [11C]4 into a cynomolgus monkey, brain radioactivity concentration (Cmax similar to 2.2 SUV) was high whereafter it decreased rapidly. The regional binding potential (BPND) values were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region. The values varied between 0.2 and 1.0 for temporal cortex, raphe nuclei, frontal cortex, and hippocampus which is consistent with the known 5-HT1A expression pattern. After pretreatment with WAY100635 (0.5 mg/kg), a homogeneous distribution of radioactivity was observed in non-human primate (NHP) brain. Although [11C]4 fulfilled important criteria for successful in vivo neuroimaging, including good blood-brain-barrier permeability and high specific binding in vitro to human brain tissue, the regional BPND values for [11C]4 in NHP brain were low when compared to those obtained with existing radioligands and thus do not merit further investigation of [11C]4. Evaluation of structurally related analogues is underway in our laboratory to identify improved candidates for clinical imaging.

While the majority of patients responds to PSMA-RLT, with 10-15% having an exceptional response, approximately 30% of patients is unresponsive to PSMA-RLT. The molecular underpinning may in part explain these varying responses. This study investigated alterations in DNA damage repair (DDR) genes in tumour biopsies and their association with response to PSMA-RLT. Methods A predefined retrospective cohort study was performed in mCRPC patients of whom the tumours had undergone next-generation sequencing of 40 DDR genes and received Lu-177-PSMA and/or Ac-225-PSMA-RLT. The primary outcome of this study was to compare the progression free survival (PFS) after PSMA-RLT for patients with and without pathogenic DDR aberrations in their tumour. Secondary outcomes were prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and overall survival (OS). Results A total of 40 patients were included of which seventeen had a tumour with a pathogenic DDR aberration (DDR+), of which eight had defects in BRCA1/2. DDR+ patients had an equal varying response to PSMA-RLT compared to those without pathological DDR anomalies (DDR-) in terms of PFS (5.9 vs. 6.4 months, respectively; HR 1.14; 95% CI 0.58-2.25; p = 0.71), >= 50% PSA response (59% vs. 65%, respectively; p = 0.75) or OS (11.1 vs. 10.7 months, respectively; HR 1.40; 95% CI: 0.68-2.91; p = 0.36). Conclusion In this study of a selected cohort, pathogenic DDR aberrations were not associated with exceptional responsiveness to PSMA-RLT. Translational studies in larger prospective cohorts are warranted to associate DDR gene defects with differential responses to PSMA-RLT.

We have recently isolated five major compounds from S. crispus sub-fraction, namely lutein, beta-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol and pheophytin a. In this study, we set out to investigate each compound's protein targets and mechanism of action through prediction of protein targets via a ligand-based target prediction protocol, Prediction IncluDinG INactives, and radioligand binding assays. The three phytosterol molecules (beta-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol) showed enrichment of hormone signaling GO terms [average ratio (AR) < 0.01], while the SMAD signaling pathway was associated with pheophytin a (AR < 0.01). GO terms associated with retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoid X receptor (RXR) were distinctly represented by protein targets of lutein (AR < 0.01). All members of the RAR/RXR family of proteins were predicted to be targeted by lutein, a feature that was not present in the other four S. crispus-derived compounds. Radioligand binding assay in vitro validated that lutein showed higher binding affinity with RXR alpha (IC50: 5.74 A mu M; K-i: 4.55 A mu M) than RAR alpha (IC50: 25.1 A mu M; K-i: 14 A mu M). Molecular docking analysis demonstrated that lutein could occupy a large hydrophobic cavity of the hRXR alpha-LBP crystal structure mainly through hydrophobic interactions with leucine and isoleucine residues, and also hydrogen bond between a hydroxyl group of lutein with Glu(239). Our findings suggest that lutein-RXR alpha interaction might play a role in the anti-breast cancer effects rendered by S. crispus.

This study examined whether [C-11]ABP688, an antagonist PET radioligand, competes with fenobam for the same binding site in the nonhuman primate brain and would allow examination of occupancy-plasma concentration relationships in the evaluation of the drug for target disorders in the human brain. Four paired PET studies with [C-11]ABP688 were performed in baboons at a baseline condition and after intravenous treatment with fenobam at different dose levels (0.3-1.33 mg/kg). Total distribution volume (V-T) and binding potential (BPND) using the cerebellum as a reference region were obtained by the plasma reference graphical method. Then it was examined whether occupancy follows a dose-dependent, saturating pattern that was predicted by a modified first-order Hill equation in individual regions. Baseline regional V-T and BPND values agreed with previously published data. Occupancy showed dose-dependent and saturating patterns in individual regions, reaching >90% occupancy at 1.33 mg/kg dose of fenobam in the majority of regions. To our knowledge, this is the first use of PET to characterize the mGluR5 therapeutic drug fenobam. This study demonstrates a proof of principle for determining the in vivo occupancy of fenobam in primates. The results indicate that [C-11]ABP688 and PET may be useful for examination of occupancy of mGluR5 by fenobam, which should prove to be useful for designing future studies and treatment of human disease states.

Investigation of cholecystokinin receptors in the human lower esophageal sphincter	WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY			English	Article						Cholecystokinins; Cholecystokinins-A receptor; Cholecystokinins-B receptor; Radioligand binding; Lower esophageal sphincter; Sling fibers; Clasp fibers	REFLUX DISEASE; RELAXATION; RESPONSES; FIBERS; CLASP; LOXIGLUMIDE; ANTAGONISTS; VOLUNTEERS; LORGLUMIDE; INTESTINE	AIM: To compare the binding of cholecystokinin (CCK)-8 to CCK receptors in sling and clasp fibers of the human lower esophageal sphincter. METHODS: Esophageal sling and clasp fibers were isolated from eight esophagectomy specimens, resected for squamous cell carcinoma in the upper two thirds of the esophagus, which had been maintained in oxygenated Kreb's solution. Western blot was used to measure CCK-A and CCK-B receptor subtypes in the two muscles. A radioligand binding assay was used to determine the binding parameters of H-3-CCK-8S to the CCK receptor subtypes. The specificity of binding was determined by the addition of proglumide, which blocks the binding of CCK to both receptor subtypes. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the sling and clasp fibers of the human lower esophageal sphincter in the amount of CCK-A [integrated optical density (IOD) value: 22.65 +/- 0.642 vs 22.328 +/- 1.042, P = 0.806] or CCK-B receptor protein (IOD value: 13.20 +/- 0.423 vs 12.45 +/- 0.294, P = 0.224) as measured by Western blot. The maximum binding of radio-labeled CCK-8S was higher in the sling fibers than in the clasp fibers (595.75 +/- 3.231 cpm vs 500.000 +/- 10.087 cpm, P < 0.001) and dissociation constant was lower (K-d: 1.437 +/- 0.024 nmol/L vs 1.671 +/- 0.024 nmol/L, P < 0.001). The IC50 of the receptor specific antagonists were lower for the CCK-A receptors than for the CCK-B (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: CCK binding modulates the contractile function of the lower esophageal sphincter through differential binding to the CCK-A receptor on the sling and clasp fibers.

Evaluation and initial in vitro and ex vivo characterization of the potential positron emission tomography ligand, BU99008 (2-(4,5-Dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-1-methyl-1H-indole), for the imidazoline2 binding site	SYNAPSE			English	Article						imidazoline2 binding site; I2BS; positron emission tomography; PET; 2-BFI	RAT-BRAIN; I-2-IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTORS; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE; SELECTIVE LIGAND; I-2 RECEPTORS; HIGH-AFFINITY; DENSITY; IDENTIFICATION; PROTEINS; 5-ISOTHIOCYANATO-2-BENZOFURANYL-2-IMIDAZOLINE	The density of the Imidazoline2 binding site (I2BS) has been shown to change in psychiatric conditions such as depression and addiction, along with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's chorea. The presence of I2BS on glial cells and the possibility that they may in some way regulate glial fibrillary acidic protein has led to increased interest into the role of I2BS and I2BS ligands in conditions characterized by marked gliosis. In addition, it has been suggested that I2BS may be a marker for human glioblastomas. Therefore, the development of a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for the I2BS would be of major benefit in our understanding of these conditions. We now report the successful synthesis and initial pharmacological evaluation of potential PET radioligands for the I2BS as well as the tritiation and characterization of the most favorable of the series, BU99008 (6), both in vitro and ex vivo in rat. The series as a whole demonstrated excellent affinity and selectivity for the I2BS, with BU99008 (6) selected as the lead candidate to be taken forward for in vivo assessment. BU99008 (6) showed very good affinity for the I2BS (Ki of 1.4 nM; Kd = 1.3 nM), good selectivity compared with the a2-adrenoceptor (909-fold). In addition, following peripheral administration, [3H]BU99008 demonstrated a heterogenous uptake into the rat brain consistent with the known distribution of the I2BS in vivo. This, and the amenability of BU99008 (6) to radiolabeling with a positron-emitting radioisotope, indicates its potential as a PET radioligand for imaging the I2BS in vivo. Synapse, 2012.

METHODS: LHRH was labeled by using (125)I with enzymatic reaction. The affinity and receptor volume of LHRH-PE40 and LHRH binding to LHRHR on the membrane surface of human liver cancer cells were measured with radioligand receptor assay. RESULTS: The specific activity of LHRH labeled with (125)I was 2.7x10(4) kBq/mu L, and its radiochemical purity reached to 99.2-99.7%. The binding of (125)I to LHRH was maximal for 240 min in the warm cultivation, and this binding was stabilized. The inhibiting rates of (125)I-LHRH and LHRH on the proliferation of human liver cancer HEPG cells were not significantly different. On the basis of the saturation curve of (125)I-LHRH binding to the membrane LHRHR of HEPG cells, (125)I-LHRH of 1x10(5) cpm was selected for radioligand receptor assay. The affinity constants (Kd) of LHRH-PE40 and LHRH binding to the membrane LHRHR of HEPG cells were 0.43 +/- 0.12 nmol/L and 4.86 +/- 1.47 nmol/L, respectively, and their receptor volumes were 0.37 +/- 0.15 mu mol/g and 0.42 +/- 0.13 mu mol/g, respectively. The binding of LHRH-PE40 to the membrane protein of normal liver cells was not observed. CONCLUSION: The recombinant toxin LHRH-PE40 binding to the membrane surface of LHRHR of human liver cancer HEPG cells was very strong, while the specific binding of it to normal liver cells was not observed. The results provide an important experimental basis for the clinical application of LHRH-PE.

In human myocardium, intrinsic activity and beta (1)-selectivity of the novel beta -adrenoceptor antagonist nebivolol have not yet been determined. 2 The study examines intrinsic activity, beta -adrenoceptor-G-protein coupling and beta (1)-selectivity of nebivolol and bisoprolol in human ventricular myocardium. Furthermore, intrinsic activity of both compounds is compared to the one of bucindolol, carvedilol and metoprolol in human atrial myocardium. 3 Radioligand binding studies ([I-125]-lodocyanopindolol) were performed on membrane preparations of human failing and nonfailing myocardium and on COS-7 cells transfected with human beta (1)- and beta (2)-adrenoceptors, respectively. Functional experiments were carried out on isolated muscle preparations of human left ventricular and right atrial myocardium from failing and nonfailing hearts. 4 Radioligand binding studies reveal 3-4 fold beta (1)-selectivity for nebivolol and 16-20 fold beta (1)-selectivity for bisoprolol in human myocardium. In COS-7-cells, beta (1)-selectivity is 3 fold for nebivolol and 15 fold for bisoprolol. 5 Neither the binding of nebivolol nor of bisoprolol is affected by the presence of guanylylimidodiphosphate (Gpp(NH)p). 6 Nebivolol and bisoprolol exert similar inverse agonist activity in human ventricular as well as atrial myocardium. In atrial myocardium, inverse agonism of both compounds is higher compared to bucindolol, equal to carvedilol and lower compared to metoprolol. 7 Favourable haemodynamic effects of nebivolol in humans are not due to beta (1)-selectivity or partial agonist activity of this agent. Other mechanisms, i.e, the production of nitric oxide, may thus be responsible for its unique haemodynamic profile.

Anesthetized male Wistar rats were injected i.v. with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist [F-18]MPPF (2 MBq, S.A. > 110 TBq/mmol) after treatment with saline (controls) or with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist 1-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phtalimido)butyl]piperazine (NAN-190) (2.5 mg/kg i.v.). After 60 min, the animals were sacrificed and 13 areas of the brain were dissected for ex vivo gamma counting. The regional distribution of radioactivity was also assessed in brain slices using a storage phosphor system. Modulation of P-glycoprotein was achieved by injection of cyclosporin A (50 mg/kg) 30 min prior to injection of [F-18]MPPF. The distribution of F-18-derived radioactivity corresponded to regional 5-HT1A receptor density as known from autoradiography. Modulation of P-glycoprotein with cyclosporin A caused a 5- to 10-fold increase in the uptake of [F-18]MPPF. Tissue/cerebellum ratios in the brain correlated with receptor densities determined by in vitro autoradiography. Measurements of plasma radioactivity showed that the increased brain uptake of [F-18]MPPF is partially due to a rise in ligand delivery after treatment with cyclosporin A (area under the curve, AUC, increased by a factor of 1.8). Biodistribution experiments in wild type and mdr1a(-/-) knockout mice confirmed that [F-18]MPPF is a substrate for P-glycoprotein. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Thermodynamic parameters of binding of A(1) adenosine receptor ligands of different intrinsic activities were determined in the absence or presence of GDP and compared to the binding mechanism after receptor-G protein uncoupling. 2 In agreement with previous studies, it was found that xanthine and non-xanthine antagonists showed an enthalpy- or enthalpy- and entropy-driven binding mechanism under all conditions. 3 In contrast to antagonists, the binding mechanism of agonists was strongly affected by the G protein coupling state or the absence or presence of guanine nucleotides. Binding of full and partial agonists to the high-affinity state of the A(1) receptor was entropy-driven in the absence of GDP, and a good correlation between intrinsic activities and the contribution of entropy was observed. In the absence of GDP, binding of full and partial agonists and antagonists to the high affinity state of the receptor was thermodynamically discriminated. In contrast, no such discrimination was found in the presence of GDP. 4 The binding mechanism of agonists to the low-affinity state of the receptor was identical to that of antagonists only after uncoupling of the receptor from G proteins by pretreatment with N-ethylmaleimide or guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate (GTP gamma S). 5 These results indicate the existence of two thermodynamically distinct high- and low-affinity states of the A(1) adenosine receptor.

However, little is known about the predictive factors for treatment success. We retrospectively analyzed Lu-PSMA radioligand treatments in 86 patients. The focus of the study was to describe clinical factors at baseline and during early treatment that are related to survival. In addition, imaging results from PSMA PET/CT-, laboratory values such as PSA-response, and safety and tolerability of the treatment were assessed. The observed side effects were comparable to previous studies and anemia was the most frequent adverse event. Pre-treatment hemoglobin level of & GE;10 g/dL and a lower PSA values at treatment start were favorable factors for longer survival. The presence of visceral or liver metastases were not significantly associated with worse prognoses. With careful patient selection, an individualized Lu-PSMA treatment approach is feasible and patients with dose-limiting factors or visceral metastases should be included in prospective trials. This novel information can be helpful for therapeutic decision making. Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is characterized by an aggressive biological behavior with a relatively short survival time, especially in progressive tumors pretreated with new hormonal agents and taxane chemotherapy. [177Lu]-Lutetium-PSMA (Lu-PSMA) treatment has proven efficacy in these patients. However, around 30% of the CRPC patients do not benefit from Lu-PSMA treatment, and little is known about predictive factors for treatment success if Lu-PSMA is offered in an individualized approach based on clinical and laboratory features. In this monocentric retrospective study, 86 CRPC patients receiving Lu-PSMA treatment were evaluated. The focus of the study was to describe clinical factors at baseline and during early treatment that are related to overall survival (OS). In addition, PSMA PET/CT-, PSA-response, and safety and tolerability (CTCAE adverse event reporting) were assessed. Efficacy endpoints were calculated using stratified Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models. Mean applied dose was 17.7 GBq (mean 5.3 & PLUSMN; 1.1 GBq per cycle) with an average of 3.6 (range 1-8) therapy cycles. Patients were followed up for a mean of 12.4 months (range 1-39). The median OS was 15 months (95% CI 12.8-17.2). The best overall response rate in patients assessed with PSMA PET/CT and PSA response was 27.9%, and 50.0% had at least stable disease. Nine patients had a & GE;grade 3 adverse event with anemia being the most frequent adverse event. Positive predictors for prolonged OS from baseline parameters were pre-treatment hemoglobin level of & GE;10 g/dL and a lower PSA values at treatment start, while the presence of visceral or liver metastases were not significantly associated with worse prognoses in this cohort. With careful patient selection, an individualized Lu-PSMA treatment approach is feasible and patients with dose-limiting factors or visceral metastases should be included in prospective trials.

To monitor these pathologies in-vivo positron emission tomography (PET) is a suitable method. After the successful radiosynthesis of [C-11]SNAP-7941-the first PET-Tracer for the MCHR1, we aimed to synthesize its [(18F)]fluoroethylated analogue: [(18F)]FE@SNAP. Therefore, microfluidic and vessel-based approaches were tested. [(18F)]fluoroethylation was conducted via various [(18F)]fluoroalkylated synthons and direct [(18F)]fluorination.

This fluorous scavenging has been shown to be effective at removing excess amines from several [S-35]sulfonylation mixtures. In many cases this results in one less semipreparative HPLC purification, and thus in higher radiochemical yield and time savings. Fluorous scavenging was compared to the use of a solid-phase resin (PS-isocyanate) and determined to be approximately equal with respect to recovery of radioactive product. However, the fluorous scavengers were shown to be more effective than solid-phase resin for removing basic amine components. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The post-mortem cortical density of hyperphosphorylated tau tangles correlates with pre-morbid cognitive dysfunction and neuron loss. Selective PET ligands including [18F]THK5117, [18F]THK5351, [18F]AV1451 (T807) and [11C]PBB3 now provide in vivo imaging information about the timing and distribution of tau in the early phases of neurodegenerative diseases. They are potential imaging biomarkers for both supporting diagnosis and tracking disease progression. Here, we discuss the challenges posed in developing selective tau ligands as biomarkers, their state of development and the new clinical information that has been revealed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Electrospun nanofibers were prepared from a Solution mixture of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and polyallylamine in the presence of a template molecule, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). The polyamine was used to provide functional groups that interact with the template during the electrospinning process, and PET acted as a major supporting matrix to ensure easy fiber formation and to minimize the conformational change of the polymers when the nanofibers were subjected to different solvent treatments. When the template was removed by solvent extraction, imprinted binding sites were left in the nanofiber materials that are capable of selectively rebinding the target molecule. The molecularly imprinted nanofibers were characterized by SEM, FT-IR, and radioligand binding analysis.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the variations on FDG PET in NEN patients treated with two different schemes of radioligand therapy (RLT) and to correlate them with clinical-pathologic variables. A prospective evaluation of 108 lesions in 56 patients (33 males and 23 females; median age, 64.5 years) affected by NENs of various primary origins (28 pancreatic, 13 gastrointestinal, 9 bronchial, 6 unknown primary (CUP-NENs) and 1 pheochromocytoma) and grades (median Ki-67 = 9%) was performed. The patients were treated with RLT within the phase II clinical trial FENET-2016 (CTID: NCT04790708). RLT was offered for 32 patients with the MONO scheme (five cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTATOC) and for 24 with the DUO scheme (three cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-DOTATOC alternated with two cycles of [Y-90]Y-DOTATOC). Variations in terms of the Delta SUVmax of a maximum of three target lesions per patient (58 for MONO and 50 for DUO RLT) were assessed between baseline and 3 months post-RLT FDG PET. In patients with negative baseline FDG PET, the three most relevant lesions on [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-peptide PET were assessed and matched on post-RLT FDG PET, to check for any possible changes in FDG avidity. Thirty-five patients (62.5%) had at least one pathological FDG uptake at the baseline scans, but the number was reduced to 29 (52%) after RLT. In the patients treated with DUO-scheme RLT, 20 out of 50 lesions were FDG positive before therapy, whereas only 14 were confirmed after RLT (p = 0.03). Moreover, none of the 30 FDG-negative lesions showed an increased FDG uptake after RLT. The lesions of patients with pancreatic and CUP-NENs treated with the DUO scheme demonstrated a significant reduction in Delta SUVmax in comparison to those treated with MONO RLT (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively). Moreover, we found a mild positive correlation between the grading and Delta SUVmax in patients treated with the MONO scheme (r = 0.39, p < 0.02), while no evidence was detected for patients treated with the DUO scheme. Our results suggest that RLT, mostly with the DUO scheme, could be effective in changing NEN lesions' glycometabolism, in particular, in patients affected by pancreatic and CUP-NENs, regardless of their Ki-67 index. Probably, associating [Y-90]Y-labelled peptides, which have high energy emission and a crossfire effect, and [Lu-177]Lu ones, characterized by a longer half-life and a safer profile for organs at risk, might represent a valid option in FDG-positive NENs addressed to RLT. Further studies are needed to validate our preliminary findings. In our opinion, FDG PET/CT should represent a potent tool for fully assessing a patient's disease characteristics, both before and after RLT.

Therapeutic options prolonging survival are limited and may result in significant bone marrow toxicity. The concept of radioligand therapy (RLT) in mCRPC is marked by the targeted delivery of radionuclides, such as beta particle emitting (177)Lutetium (Lu-177) to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a transmembrane protein frequently present on prostate cancer cells. RLT has yielded promising anti-tumoral activity and excellent tolerability in patients with mCRPC as shown by multiple retrospective series and a growing number of prospective trials. The presented study aims to investigate the role of RLT in mCRPC patients with metastases diffusely involving the bone marrow. Special emphasis is laid on identifying early indicators for a favorable treatment response and potential risk factors for adverse outcomes. The impact of RLT-specific variables, including administered treatment activity, cumulative activity and whole-body absorbed dose is assessed individually. Advanced stage metastatic prostate cancer with extensive bone marrow involvement is associated with a high risk of therapy-induced myelotoxicity and unfavorable outcomes. The role of salvage radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA-617 in this subset of patients remains to be further elucidated. Forty-five patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and diffuse bone marrow involvement were treated with repeated cycles of RLT after having exhausted standard treatment options. A mean treatment activity of 7.4 +/- 1.4 GBq Lu-177-PSMA-617 was administered in a median of four treatment cycles (IQR 2-6) and the mean cumulative activity was 32.6 +/- 20.1 GBq. After two RLT cycles, >= 50% PSA decline was observed in 25/45 (56%) patients and imaging-based partial remission (PR) was observed in 18/45 (40%) patients. Median imaging-based progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.4 mo (95% CI, 3.0-9.8) and the median overall survival (OS) was 10.2 months (95% CI, 7.2-12.8). The biochemical response translated into a significantly prolonged PFS (12.9 vs. 2.8 mo, p < 0.001) and OS (13.5 vs. 6.7 mo, p < 0.001). Patients with PR on interim imaging after two cycles had a longer median OS compared to patients with stable or progressive disease (15.5 vs. 7.1 mo, p < 0.001). Previous taxane-based chemotherapy (HR 3.21, 95%CI 1.18-8.70, p = 0.02) and baseline LDH levels (HR 1.001, 95%CI 1.000-1.001, p = 0.04) were inversely associated with OS on a Cox-regression analysis. Grade >= 3 hematological decline was observed after 22/201 (11%) cycles with anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia in 15/45 (33%), 6/45 (13%) and 8/45 (18%) patients, respectively. Cumulative treatment activity and absorbed whole-body dose were not correlated with new onset grade >= 3 hematotoxicity (p = 0.91, p = 0.69). No event of grade >= 3 chronic kidney disease was observed during RLT or the follow-up. Last line RLT with Lu-177-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients with diffuse bone marrow involvement may thus contribute to prolonged disease control at an acceptable safety profile.

In this study, we present an LC-ESI-MS/MS method for the quantification of (R,R)-4-(2-benzhydryloxyethyl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidin-3-ol [(R,R)-D-84, (R,R)-1], (S,S)-reboxetine [(S,S)-2], and (S)-citalopram [(S)-3] employed as highly selective nonlabeled reporter ligands in MS Binding Assays addressing the dopamine [DAT, (R,R)-D-84], norepinephrine [NET, (S,S)-reboxetine] and serotonin transporter [SERT, (S)-citalopram], respectively. The developed LC-ESI-MS/MS method uses a pentafluorphenyl stationary phase in combination with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and ammonium formate buffer for chromatography and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the multiple reaction monitoring mode for mass spectrometric detection. Quantification is based on deuterated derivatives of all three analytes serving as internal standards. The established LC-ESI-MS/MS method enables fast, robust, selective and highly sensitive quantification of all three reporter ligands in a single chromatographic run. The method was validated according to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) guideline for bioanalytical method validation regarding selectivity, accuracy, precision, calibration curve and sensitivity. Finally, filtration-based MS Binding Assays were performed for all three monoamine transporters based on this LC-ESI-MS/MS quantification method as read out. The affinities determined in saturation experiments for (R,R)-D-84 toward hDAT, for (S,S)-reboxetine toward hNET, and for (S)-citalopram toward hSERT, respectively, were in good accordance with results from literature, clearly demonstrating that the established MS Binding Assays have the potential to be an efficient alternative to radioligand binding assays widely used for this purpose so far.

The 2-tissue-compartment model and multilinear analysis-1 were applied to calculate 5 outcome measures in 14 brain regions: distribution volume (V-T), V-T normalized by f(P) (V-T/f(P)), and 3 binding potentials (nondisplaceable binding potential, binding potential relative to total plasma concentration, and binding potential relative to free plasma concentration: BPND, BPP, BPF, respectively). Since KOR is distributed ubiquitously throughout the brain, there are no suitable reference regions. We used a fixed fraction of individual cerebellar V-T value (V-T,V- CER) as the nondisplaceable V-T (V-ND) (V-ND 5 V-T,V- CER/1.17). The relative and absolute test-retest variability and intraclass correlation coefficient were evaluated for the outcome measures of C-11-LY2795050. Results: The test-retest variability of C-11-LY2795050 for V-T was no more than 10% in any region and was 12% in the amygdala. For binding potential (BPND and BPP), the test-retest variability was good in regions of moderate and high KOR density (BPND > 0.4) and poor in regions of low density. Correction by f(P) (V-T/f(P) or BPF) did not improve the test-retest performance. Conclusion: Our results suggest that quantification of C-11-LY2795050 imaging is reproducible and reliable in regions with moderate and high KOR density. Therefore, we conclude that this first antagonist radiotracer is highly useful for PET studies of KOR.

The endocannabinoid system is an important modulatory system in the brain. Complex interactions with brain dopaminergic circuits have been demor strated. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of the commonly used antiparkinsonian drugs, levodopa (L-DOPA) and bromocriptine, on type 1 cannabinoid (CB1) receptors, using the PET radioligand [(18)F]MK-9470 Experimental approach Seventeen female Wistar rats were studied at baseline and after chronic exposure to either L-DOPA (6 mg/kg/day with 1.5 mg/kg/day carbidopa; n = 6), bromocriptine (4 mg/kg/day; n = 5), or saline (a = 6). 1:[(18)F]MK-9470 binding was assessed in vivo using small animal PET imaging. [(18)F]MK-9470 parametric Images were generated, anatomically standardized to Paxinos space and analyzed by voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM2) and a predefined volume-of-interest (VOI.) approach Results. In a 2 x 2 analysis design (condition vs. treatment), no significant changes in absolute or relative [(18)F]MK-9470 binding were present upon chrome exposure to L-DOPA or bromocriptine as compared to saline treatment. The post hoc comparison of chronic scans to baseline within each treatment modality showed regional increases in relative [(18)F]MK-9470 binding in the thalamus (peak average value +6.3%) and in the sensorimotor cortex and hippocampus (peak average value +10.2%) after bromocriptine exposure, while no changes were found for L-DOPA. Conclusion. Chronic administration of L-DOPA and bromocriptine at the applied doses does not produce major cerebral changes in in vivo cannabinoid CB1 receptor binding of [(18)F]MK-9470 in the rat brain These results also suggest that similar chronic L-DOPA and bromocriptine usage is unlikely to interfere with human PET imaging in healthy conditions using this radioligand Synapse 64:617-623,2010.

Radioligand-binding studies with [H-3] QNB were conducted using specimens collected from patients ( 36 - 77 years) with normal bladder function, undergoing surgery. For RT-PCR, biopsies of normal bladder were obtained from patients ( 30 - 88 years) undergoing check cystoscopy. 2 Binding of [ 3H] QNB in detrusor ( n = 20) was of high affinity (K-D 77.1 (55.2 - 99.0) pM) and capacity (B-max 181 +/- 7 fmol mg protein(-1)). Similar values were obtained in mucosa ( n = 6) ( K-D 100.5 ( 41.2-159.9) pM; B-max 145 +/- 9 fmol mg protein(-1)). 3 Competition-binding experiments in detrusor membranes with muscarinic receptor antagonists including trospium, darifenacin, 4-DAMP, methoctramine, AQ-RA 741, AF-DX 116 and pirenzepine indicated a receptor population of 71% M-2, 22% M-3 and 7% M-1. In the mucosa, 75% of sites were M-2 receptors, with 25% M-3/M-5. 4 Using RT - PCR, expression of M-1, M-2, M-3 and M-5 mRNA was demonstrated in both detrusor and mucosa. 5 The presence of a high density of mainly M-2 muscarinic receptors in the mucosa appears to be a novel finding and raises the question of their physiological significance and the source of their endogenous ligand. 6 There was a negative correlation of receptor number (B-max) with age in detrusor muscle from male patients ( P = 0.02). Quantitative competitive RT - PCR demonstrated a selective age-related decrease in mRNA for muscarinic M-3 but not M-2 receptors, in both male ( P<0.0001) and female ( P = 0.019) detrusor. These findings correspond with reports of decreased detrusor contractility with ageing.

PET can provide this information if an appropriate radioligand is available. [F-18]MPPF (4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2"-pyridinyl)-p-[F-18]fluorobenzamido]ethylpiperazine) is a selective radioligand for serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. We have established that the binding potential (BP=B-max/K-D) of [F-18]MPPF for cerebral 5-HT1A receptors can be assessed in human brain without arterial sampling. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess if 5-HT1A receptor occupancy can be measured through calculation of a drug-related decrease in BP with [F-18]MPPF and PET. Methods: Six volunteers were scanned twice using a Siemens Exact HR+ camera following injection of 70+/-18 MBq [F-18]MPPF (baseline and medicated conditions). Before the second scan, volunteers orally received either 3x10 mg pindolol at T=-15.5 h, T=-6.5 h, and T=-1.5 h (n=3) or 10 mg buspirone in a single dose at T=-1.5 h (n=3). Binding potentials were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model with the cerebellum as reference. Results: Administration of 30 mg pindolol led to a significant reduction in [F-18]MPPF binding potential of 42+/-17%. In contrast, no significant reduction of [F-18]MPPF binding potential was observed following administration of buspirone (5+/-17%). Conclusions: These results show that [F-18]MPPF can be used for measurement of drug-related 5-HT1A receptor occupancy and may be of particular interest in determining the 5-HT1A receptor interaction of new or established drugs in phase 1 and early phase 2 drug trials. Apparently, the 5-HT1A partial agonist buspirone is already clinically effective at low levels of 5-HT1A receptor occupancy.

The receptor displayed the following binding characteristics in equilibrium dialysis experiments (37 degrees C, pH 7.4) with [H-3] folate: a high-affinity type of binding that exhibited positive cooperativity with a Hill coefficient > 1.0 and an upward convex Scatchard plot, a slow radioligand dissociation at pH 7.4 becoming rapid at pH 3.5 and inhibition in the presence of other folates. The molecular size of the receptor was 100 kDa on gel filtration with Triton X-100, or similar to that of high molecular weight human milk folate binding protein (FBP). The latter protein represents a 25 kDa molecule which equipped with a hydrophobic glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) membrane anchor susceptible to cleavage by phosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) forms micelles of 100 kDa size with Triton X-100. The HeLa cell FR immunoreacted with antibodies against purified human milk FBP in ELISA, and in a fluorescence activated cell sorting system, where HeLa cells exposed to increasing concentrations of antibody showed a dose-dependent response. Exposure to PI-PLC decreased the fraction of immunolabeled cells indicating a linkage of FR to cell membranes by a GPI anchor. HeLa cells incubated with radiofolate showed a continuous uptake with time, however, with a complete suppression of uptake in the presence of an excess of cold folate. Prewash of cells at acidic pH to remove endogenous folate increased the uptake. Binding and uptake of [H-3] folate was increased in cells grown in a folate-deprived medium. The HeLa FR seems to be epitope related to human milk FBP.

In this review, we describe the comparative features of the tachykinin peptides and their receptors, focusing particularly on amphibians. We also summarize our systematic studies of the localization, characteristics, and actions of bufokinin, a toad substance P-related peptide, in its species of origin. In addition, we discuss the establishment of multiple isoforms of the NK1-like receptor in the toad, and their structure, pharmacology and tissue distributions. We conclude that tachykinin peptides and receptors are well conserved in terms of their structures, physiological functions and coupling mechanisms during tetrapod evolution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

Binding characteristics of [C-11]DASB and the propensity for serotonin to displace the tracer were explored in rat brain homogenates. Experiments showed that serotonin displaced [C-11]DASB in vitro. Ex vivo experiments performed after tranylcypromine injection (3 or 15 mg/kg) showed a dose-dependent trend in radioactivity uptake and suggested that serotonin may compete with [C-11]DASB for transporter binding.

However, little is known about the pattern of PK11195 binding sites in healthy brain. Therefore, we used quantitative autoradiography to measure the saturation binding parameters for [H-3]PK11195 in cryostat sections from young Landrace pigs. Specific binding was lowest in the cerebellar white matter (85 fmol mg(-1)) and highest in the caudate nucleus (370 fmol mg(-1)), superior colliculus (400 fmol mg(-1)), and anterior thalamic nucleus (588 fmol mg(-1)). The apparent affinity was in the range of 2-6 nM in vitro, predicting high specific binding in PET studies of living brain. However, the distribution volume (V-d, ml g(-1)) of high specific activity [C-11]PK11195 was nearly homogeneous (3 ml g(-1)) throughout brain of healthy Landrace pigs, and was nearly identical in studies with lower specific activity, suggesting that factors in vivo disfavor the detection of PBBS in Landrace pigs with this radioligand. In young, adult Gottingen minipig brain, the magnitude of V-d for [C-11]PK11195 was in the range 5-10 ml g(-1), and had a heterogeneous distribution resembling the in vitro findings in Landrace pigs. There was a trend toward globally increased V-d in a group of minipigs with acute MPTP-induced parkinsonism, but no increase in V-d was evident in the same pigs rescanned at 2 weeks after grafting of fetal mesencephalon to the partially denervated striatum. Thus, [C-11]PK11195 binding was not highly sensitive to constituitively expressed PBBS in brain of young Landrace pigs, and did not clearly demonstrate the expected microglial activation in the MPTP/xenograft model of minipigs.

Saturation binding experiments performed using the new high affinity A(2B) adenosine radioligand [H-3]-N-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-2-[5-(2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-2,3,6,7-tetra hydro-1H-purin-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yloxy]-acetamide ([H-3]-MRE 2029F20) revealed a single class of binding sites in hA(2B)CHO, hA(2B)HEK-293 and HMC-1 cells with K-D (nM) of 1.65 +/- 0.18, 2.83 +/- 0.34, 2.62 +/- 0.27 and B-max (fmol/mg protein) of 36 +/- 4, 475 +/- 50 and 128 +/- 15, respectively. The pharmacological profile of new compounds, determined in inhibition binding experiments in hA(2B)HEK-293 cells using [H-3]-MRE 2029F20, showed a rank order of potency typical of the A(2B) receptors with K-i values in the range 3.2-28 nM. In functional assays, recognised agonists and antagonists were studied by evaluating their capability to modulate the cAMP production in hA(2B)CHO and in HMC-1 cells. Novel compounds were able to decrease NECA-stimulated cAMP production in hA(2B)CHO and in HMC-1 cells showing a high potency. New compounds were also able to inhibit cAMP levels in the absence of NECA and in the presence of forskolin stimulation in hA2BCHO and in HMC-1 cells. In HEK-293 cells MIZE 20291720 reduced cAMP basal levels with an IC50 value of 2.9 +/- 0.3 nM. These results suggest that novel compounds are antagonists with an inverse agonist activity in recombinant and native human A(2B) receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Sample of frontal cortex, striatum and hippocampus were also investigated as reference tissues. The dopamine D1-like receptor antagonist [H-3]SCH 23390 and the dopamine D2-like receptor agonist [H-3]7-OH-DPAT were used as radioligands. The affinity (K-d) of [H-3]SCH 23390 or of [H-3]7-OH-DPAT binding was unchanged in lymphocytes of rats of different age groups. The density (B-max) of [H-3]SCH 23390 binding sites increased from the 1st to the 3rd week of age, remained constant from the 3rd to the 8th week of age, and then increased slightly at 12 and 16 weeks of age. The Bma value of [(3)(H)]7-OH-DPAT binding to lymphocytes increased from the 1st to the 3rd week of age, remained constant from the 3rd to the 4th week, increased again until the 12th week and then plateaued. Dopamine D1-like and D2-like receptor maturation in frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum revealed an increased receptor density until the 4th week of age and a relative stabilization of receptor density values between the 4th to the 12th week depending on the area considered. Comparatively postnatal maturation of lymphocyte dopamine D1-like receptors displayed a pattern different from that of brain areas investigated, whereas maturation of D2-like receptors displayed a pattern similar to that of striatum. The quantitative and/or qualitative dissimilarities between development of lymphocyte and brain dopamine receptors suggest that from a developmental point of view lymphocyte dopamine receptors probably cannot be considered as a marker of homologous brain receptors.

Among these, thymomas have been recently detected. Here we report on 2 patients admitted for myasthenia gravis and radiological evidence of thymic mass. Although these patients had similar clinical presentation, in vivo SSR scintigraphy displayed a difference in the degree of the [In-111-DTPA(0)]octreotide uptake. Considering that both thymic masses had comparable volume, [In-111-DTPA(0)]octreotide level was significantly higher in one of the 2 tumors (tumor/background ratio of 5.7 vs 2.6). The SSR subtype expression pattern was studied in vitro on the surgically resected specimens by ligand binding techniques, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. According to the recent World Health Organization classification, the 2 tumors were classified A and B2 thymomas respectively. In membrane homogenates, we found a higher number of high affinity [I-125-Tyr(11)]-SS-14 binding sites in the B2 thymomas (23.5 +/-2.5 vs 12.0 +/-0.4 fmol/mg membrane protein; p<0.05). RT-PCR analysis showed sst(1), sst(2A) and sst(3) mRNA in the 2 thymoma tissues, whereas SS mRNA was detectable only in the A thymoma. Quantitative evaluation of RT-PCR data showed a comparable expression of the relative amount of sst(2A) mRNA in both tumors, whereas a significant higher expression of sst(3) mRNA in the B2 thymoma. Sst(2A) immunoreactivity was localized mainly on the endothelium of intratumoral vessels, whereas sst(3) was present on either tumoral epithelial cells or normal reactive thymocytes. The expression of sst(2A) receptors in these tumors is in line with the in vivo visualization by [In-111-DTPA(0)]octreotide, which is considered a sst(2)-preferring ligand. However, since radioligand uptake was significantly higher in the B2 thymoma, which expressed the largest sst(3) mRNA levels, it might be possible that this subtype is involved in determining the tumor visualization during SSR scintigraphy. Apart from the affinity of the radioligand for the receptor, also the efficacy of the internalization of the radioligand-receptor complex might play a role in radioactivity accumulation during in vivo SSR scintigraphy. In fact, although octreotide binds with lower affinity to sst3 receptors, this subtype displayed the highest amount of agonist-dependent receptor internalization compared to the other SSR subtypes. Moreover, sst3 was localized on both tumor cells and reactive thymocytes, and these latter cells are characterized by a very active turnover of membrane molecules. Finally, although more cases need to be evaluated, the lack of detection of SS mRNA in the tumor presenting a more aggressive phenotype (B2 thymoma) might have physiopathological or prognostic significance.

Radioligand therapy (RLT) with (177)lutetium (Lu)-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) ligands has been increasingly used in recent years for therapy of metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Studies have revealed that Lu-177-PSMA ligand therapy is well tolerated and appears to cause fewer adverse effects than current standard of care third-line treatments. Notably, since Lu-177-PSMA agents are predominantly excreted by kidneys, there are concerns relating to their potential nephrotoxicity and renal outcomes. Although many recent studies have focused on mostly nephrotoxic adverse reactions at up to 3-month follow-up, assessment of renal outcomes after Lu-177-PSMA RLT in longer term follow-up is lacking. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of Lu-177-PSMA RLT on renal function in patients treated for mCRPC at >3months post-therapy. Methods. In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed 195 men with progressive mCRPC who had received therapy with Lu-177-PSMA as second- or third-line after standard therapeutic interventions. Patients underwent investigations with Ga-68-PSMA-ligand positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan to confirm PSMA-expressing mCRPC. Eligible patients were required to have estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >30mL/min/1.73 m(2), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score <3, no severe liver injury (as characterized by liver function tests) and no significant bone marrow dysfunction. Enrolled patients received two to five cycles of intravenous Lu-177-PSMA I&T or Lu-177-PSMA-617, at 6- to 10-week intervals. Renal outcomes were assessed according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines as incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI), acute kidney disease (AKD) or chronic kidney disease (CKD). All assessments and tests were undertaken between therapy cycles and at follow-up of at least 3months. Results. Of 195 assessed men with mCRPC, 110 patients aged [mean SD (range)] 70 +/- 8 (53-92) years were recruited into this study with median follow-up of 8 (interquartile range 5-12, minimum 3, maximum 29) months and mean baseline eGFR 81 +/- 13mL/min/1.73 m(2). Pre-existing CKD was identified in 12% of patients. None of the patients experienced an AKI during RLT. Two AKD and three CKD G3a cases were identified. Analysis of possible impact of prior CKD and major risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, history of AKI) on incidence of AKD or CKD demonstrated relative risk 4.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-14.29] and 1.91 (95% CI 1.14-3.12), respectively. However, Fisher's exact test did not reveal statistical significance of the impact of both conditions. Conclusions. Current Lu-PSMA RLT protocols appear to carry a mild nephrotoxic risk with the rate of about 4.5%. Prior CKD is potentially the most significant risk factor of post-RLT renal dysfunction.

The goal of this work was to investigate alternative strategies for the radiochemical synthesis, purification, and formulation of [C-11]ER176. An optimized tri-solvent high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) protocol is described to separate the hydro-de-chlorinated byproduct from [C-11]ER176. A newly implemented solid phase extraction work-up efficiently removed HPLC solvent while maintaining chemical purity and overall radiochemical yield and purity. This new HPLC purification and final formulation was completed within 40 min, providing 2.7 +/- 0.5 GBq of [C-11]ER176 at end of synthesis with 1400 +/- 300 GBq/ mu mol molar activity while meeting all specifications for radiopharmaceutical quality control tests for human research use.

An Overview of the Phase III VISION Trial and Its Importance for the Future of Theranostics	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate cancer; PSMA-targeted therapy; theranostics	PSMA; LU-177-PSMA-617; DIAGNOSIS; DOSIMETRY	Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is of considerable interest as a target for diagnostics and therapy of prostate cancer patients. PSMA-targeted imaging has demonstrable value in guiding the management of the clinical evolution of prostatic cancer. The use of PSMA-targeted therapy using Lu-177-labeled PSMA-617 is similarly effective and is progressing toward approval. The phase III VISION trial represents the largest well-designed and executed study of a theranostic pair. This article provides an overview of the phase III trial and delineates the different study arms and their implications in the assessment of efficacy.

The 2-chloro-5'-(N,N-dimethyl)uronamido analogues bound to, but did not activate, the human A(3)AR, with K-i values of 29 nM (4'-O) and 15 nM (4'-S), showing > 100-fold selectivity over A(1), A(2A), and A(2B)ARs. Competitive antagonism was demonstrated by Schild analysis. The 2-(dimethylamino)-5'-(N,N-dimethyl)uronamido substitution also retained A3AR selectivity but lowered affinity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Derivatisation included changes in the arylamide moiety and the tetrahydroisoquinoline substructure leading to compounds with markedly improved selectivities and affinities in the low nanomolar concentration range. From the 55 structures presented here, (E)-3-(4-iodophenyl)-N-(4-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)butyl)actylamide (51) has high affinity (K-i(hD(3))=12 nM) and a 123-fold preference for the D-3 receptor relative to the D-2 receptor subtype. Its pharmacological profile offers the prospect of a novel radioligand as a tool for various dopamine D-3-receptor-related in vitro and in vivo investigations.

[125 I]-BHSP binding was localised to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), hypoglossal nucleus and inferior olivary complex, whereas [I-121]-neurokinin A and [H-3]-senktide binding were confined to the NTS. The distribution and density of binding sites were similar in vehicle- and capsaicin-pretreated rats, suggesting that sensory neuron ablation by neonatal capsaicin does not affect tachykinin receptor numbers in the rat caudal brainstem.

Radioligand binding assays proved that the majority of the novel compounds behaved as good to excellent ligands at the 5-HT1A receptor, some of which were selective with respect 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Six analogues (1a, 2a, 2b, 2c, 2e and 2i) were selected and further evaluated for their binding affinities on D-1, D-2 dopaminergic and alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. A o-OCH3 derivative (2e) bound at 5-HT1A sites with subnanomolar affinity (IC50 = 0.059 nM) and shows high selectivity over all considered receptors and may offer a new lead for the development of therapeutically efficacious agents.

A 90 min dynamic scan was acquired in human volunteers on simultaneous PET-MRI. The radiochemical purity was amounted to 94 +/- 2%. The animal biodistribution showed high uptake in the brain specifically in the cortex region. The human images showed binding in benzodiazepines (BZ) receptor-rich regions, such as the neocortex, and the lowest uptake in the pons.

Radioligand binding assay was used to determine the binding affinity of target compounds. Members of this class have great selectivity and binding affinity in D3 receptor. In addition, the ability of these compounds to mitigate the symptoms of addiction from opioids was investigated in animal behavior patterns, and we have found that two compounds (18a and 18d) have good affinity in the D3R and exhibit the efficacy of anti-drug addiction in morphine-dependent mice induced by naloxone.

A secondary target for the benzodiazepine diazepam, TSPO has been a protein of interest for researchers for decades, particularly owing to its well-established links to inflammatory conditions in the central and peripheral nervous systems. It has become a key biomarker for assessing microglial activation using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in patients with diseases ranging from atherosclerosis to Alzheimer's disease. This Account describes research published by our group over the past 15 years surrounding the development of TSPO ligands and their use in probing the function of this high-value target.

Direct neurotransmitter activation of voltage-gated potassium channels	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							K+ CHANNEL; ANTICONVULSANT RETIGABINE; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; XENOPUS OOCYTES; KCNQ2 SUBUNITS; PC12 CELLS; EADOCK DSS; I-KS; ACID; EPILEPSY	Voltage-gated potassium channels KCNQ2-5 generate the M-current, which controls neuronal excitability. KCNQ2-5 subunits each harbor a high-affinity anticonvulsant drug-binding pocket containing an essential tryptophan (W265 in human KCNQ3) conserved for >500 million years, yet lacking a known physiological function. Here, phylogenetic analysis, electrostatic potential mapping, in silico docking, electrophysiology, and radioligand binding assays reveal that the anticonvulsant binding pocket evolved to accommodate endogenous neurotransmitters including.-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which directly activates KCNQ5 and KCNQ3 via W265. GABA, and endogenous metabolites beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHB) and gamma-amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (GABOB), competitively and differentially shift the voltage dependence of KCNQ3 activation. Our results uncover a novel paradigm: direct neurotransmitter activation of voltage-gated ion channels, enabling chemosensing of the neurotransmitter/metabolite landscape to regulate channel activity and cellular excitability.

Ten commercial antibodies for alpha-1-adrenergic receptor subtypes are nonspecific	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Alpha-1-adrenoceptor; Antibodies; Subtypes	KNOCKOUT; ALPHA-1D	Commercial antibodies are used widely to quantify and localize the alpha 1-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes, alpha 1A, alpha 1B, and alpha 1D. We tested ten antibodies, from abcam and Santa Cruz, using western blot with heart and brain tissue from wild-type (WT) mice and mice with systemic knockout (KO) of one or all three subtypes. We found that none of the antibodies detected a band in WT that was absent in the appropriate KO or in the KO that was null for all alpha 1-ARs (ABDKO). We conclude that the antibodies we tested are not specific for alpha 1-ARs. These results raise caution with prior studies using these reagents. For now, competition radioligand binding is the only reliable approach to quantify the alpha 1-AR subtype proteins. Receptor protein localization remains a challenge.

By using a combination of co-immunoprecipitation, pull-out with glutathione S-transferase-fusion proteins and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we have reported that the D1R forms a heteromeric complex with the NMDAR (NMDA receptor) and that this mechanism is crucial to recruit the D1R to the postsynaptic density. By using confocal and radioligand-binding assay, we also demonstrated that the interaction with NMDAR abolishes agonist-mediated D1R sequestration, indicating that oligomerization with NMDAR could represent a novel regulatory mechanism modulating D1R cellular trafficking and desensitization.

It has also been observed that, independent of the presence of aggregated proteins, neuroinflammation could be present in different neurodegenerative diseases. It has also been suggested that neuroinflammation could occur well ahead of amyloid deposition in AD. Recent genetic studies and other preclinical studies specifically point to a role of neuroinflammation and, in this review, we evaluate the evidence of neuroinflammation in the Alzheimer's disease trajectory and the different imaging modalities by which we could monitor neuroinflammation in vivo in humans.

Nine months later, right hemiparesis and seizure of right limbs developed. 18F-FDG and 18F-PBR06 (18 kDa translocator protein, TSPO) radioligand PET/MRI of the whole body revealed intense uptake in the intracranial lesions. Intracranial lymphoma was diagnosed by stereotactic needle brain biopsy. Mononeuropathies could be paraneoplastic syndromes. TSPO shows high uptake in intracranial lymphoma on 18F-PBR06 PET images.

Relationships between local population data obtained from Social Explorer analyses of the American Community Survey (2014-2018) and dopamine D2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability were explored in this retrospective analysis of [11C]PHNO positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data (n = 70). Larger local population size and lower percentage of the population with a bachelor's degree or higher were significantly associated with higher striatal D2/3R availability, suggesting that living in a populous area with fewer educational resources may be accompanied by stressors with concomitant dopaminergic changes. Future prospective, collaborative studies are needed to better understand the precise etiology of the observed relationships.

In all, 29 representatives were tested for r and opioid receptor affinity, leading to the identification of compounds possessing improved sigma(1) selectivity and, for the first time in this series, examples possessing preferential sigma(2) affinity. Several structural features associated with these selectivity trends have been identified. Two analogues of improved selectivity were evaluated in a binding panel of 43 CNS-relevant targets to confirm their sigma receptor preference. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

GAD65 and IA-2 autoantibodies were measured by radioligand binding assay using recombinant human GAD65 and IA-2. The frequency of GAD65 was not significantly different between patients and controls. However, IA-2 antibodies were predominant in LADA patients and there were two distinct peaks, one in the age group of 20 to 30 years and another in the age group of 50 to 60 years. The data suggest that LADA is more frequent in Eastern Indian T2DM patients and the IA-2 is the predominant autoantibody in this population.

A contig complementary to an intronless coding nucleotide sequence was found. The sequence was amplified from bovine EC DNA, further cloned into pcDNA3 and expressed in COS-1 cells. The bovine B1R sequence was confirmed and extended. A putative Zn2+-binding motif HEXXH is not present (replaced by HDAWP). The receptor binds [H-3]Lys-desArg(9)- bradykinin in a saturable manner (K-d 0.36 nM) and exhibits a pharmacological profile similar to that of human B1R.

The short- and long-term regulatory mechanisms of NAC on the 6-OHDA hemiparkinsonian rat model were longitudinally investigated by performing positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the specific dopamine transporter (DAT) radioligand [F-18]FE-PE2I. The results demonstrate that after a unilateral dopamine insult NAC has a strong influence on the non-lesioned hemisphere by decreasing the levels of DAT in the striatum early after the lesion. We interpret this early and short-term decrease of DAT in the healthy striatum of NAC-treated animals as a beneficial compensatory effect induced by NAC.

P.; Smit, Martine J.; Leurs, Rob			Pharmacological Characterization of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]VUF11211, a Novel Radiolabeled Small-Molecule Inverse Agonist for the Chemokine Receptor CXCR3	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							ANTAGONISTS; BINDING; PROTEIN; LIGANDS; MODULATION; MECHANISM; DISCOVERY; DRUG	Chemokine receptor CXCR3 has attracted much attention, as it is thought to be associated with a wide range of immunerelated diseases. As such, several small molecules with different chemical structures targeting CXCR3 have been discovered. Despite limited clinical success so far, these compounds serve as interesting tools for investigating receptor activation and antagonism. Accumulating evidence suggests that many of these compounds are allosteric modulators for CXCR3. One feature of allosteric ligands is that the magnitude of the mediated allosteric effect is dependent on the orthosteric probe that is used. Consequently, there is a risk for incorrect assessment of affinity for allosteric modulators with orthosteric radioligands, which has so far been the most applied approach for chemokine receptors. Therefore, we aimed to use a small-molecule allosteric ligand from the piperazinyl-piperidine class, also known as VUF11211 [(S)-5-chloro-6-(4-(1-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl)-3-ethylpiperazin1-yl)-N-ethylnicotinamide]. VUF11211 acts as an inverse agonist at a constitutively active mutant of CXCR3. Radiolabeling of VUF11211 gave [H-3] VUF11211, which in radioligand binding studies shows high affinity for CXCR3 (K-d = 0.65 nM) and reasonably fast association (k(on) = 0.03 minute(-1)nM(-1)) and dissociation kinetics (k(off) = 0.02 minute(-1)). The application of the [H-3] VUF11211 to assess CXCR3 pharmacology was validated with diverse classes of CXCR3 compounds, including both antagonists and agonists, as well as VUF11211 analogs. Interestingly, VUF11211 seems to bind to a different population of CXCR3 conformations compared with the CXCR3 agonists CXC chemokine ligand 11 (CXCL11), VUF11418 [1-((1R,5S)-6,6-dimethylbicyclo[3.1.1] hept-2-en-2-yl)N-((2'-iodobiphenyl-4-yl)methyl)-N,N-dimethylmethanaminium Iodide], and VUF10661 [N-(6-amino-1-(2,2-diphenylethylamino)1-oxohexan-2-yl)-2-(4-oxo-4-phenylbutanoyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamide]. These findings, taken together, indicate that this allosteric inverse agonist radioligand for CXCR3 may facilitate the discovery, characterization, and optimization of allosteric modulators for the chemokine receptor CXCR3.

Neuroinflammation and brain atrophy in former NFL players: An <i>in vivo</i> multimodal imaging pilot study	NEUROBIOLOGY OF DISEASE			English	Article						Mild traumatic brain injury; Translocator protein; Neuroinflammation; Microglia; Molecular neuroimaging	PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS; PROTEIN 18 KDA; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; CHRONIC TRAUMATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; LEAGUE PLAYERS; RECURRENT CONCUSSION; PET RADIOLIGAND; HEAD IMPACTS; INJURY	There are growing concerns about potential delayed, neuropsychiatric consequences (e.g, cognitive decline, mood or anxiety disorders) of sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). Autopsy studies of brains from a limited number of former athletes have described characteristic, pathologic changes of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) leading to questions about the relationship between these pathologic and the neuropsychiatric disturbances seen in former athletes. Research in this area will depend on in vivo methods that characterize molecular changes in the brain, linking CTE and other sports-related pathologies with delayed emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this pilot project we studied former National Football League (NFL) players using new neuroimaging techniques and clinical measures of cognitive functioning. We hypothesized that former NFL players would show molecular and structural changes in medial temporal and parietal lobe structures as well as specific cognitive deficits, namely those of verbal learning and memory. We observed a significant increase in binding of [C-11]DPA-713 to the translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of brain injury and repair, in several brain regions, such as the supramarginal gyrus and right amygdala, in 9 former NFL players compared to 9 age-matched, healthy controls. We also observed significant atrophy of the right hippocampus. Finally, we report that these same former players had varied performance on a test of verbal learning and memory, suggesting that these molecular and pathologic changes may play a role in cognitive decline. These results suggest that localized brain injury and repair, indicated by increased [C-11]DPA-713 binding to TSPO, may be linked to history of NFL play. [11C]DPA-713 PET is a promising new tool that can be used in future study design to examine further the relationship between TSPO expression in brain injury and repair, selective regional brain atrophy, and the potential link to deficits in verbal learning and memory after NFL play.

Evaluation of the Sensitivity of the Novel α4β2*Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor PET Radioligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-(-)-NCFHEB to Increases in Synaptic Acetylcholine Levels in Rhesus Monkeys	SYNAPSE			English	Article						F-18-(-)-NCFHEB; F-18-(-)-Flubatine; nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; acetylcholine; rhesus monkeys; brain; physostigmine; donepezil	IN-VIVO; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; INHIBITION; BINDING; AFFINITY; RADIOSYNTHESIS; RADIOTRACER; ENANTIOMERS; ANESTHETICS; RELEASE	Objective(18)F-(-)-NCFHEB (also known as F-18-(-)-Flubatine) is a new radioligand to image 42* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET), with faster kinetics than previous radioligands such as F-18-2-F-A85380. The goal of this study was to assess the sensitivity of F-18-(-)-NCFHEB-PET to increases in synaptic acetylcholine concentration induced by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. MethodsTwo rhesus monkeys were scanned four times each on a Focus 220 scanner: first at baseline, then during two bolus plus infusions of physostigmine (0.06-0.28 mg/kg), and finally following a bolus injection of donepezil (0.25 mg/kg). The arterial input function and the plasma free fraction f(P) were measured. F-18-(-)-NCFHEB volume of distribution V-T was estimated using the multilinear analysis MA1 and then normalized by plasma free fraction f(P). Results(18)F-(-)-NCFHEB f(P) was 0.890.04. At baseline, F-18-(-)-NCFHEB V-T/f(P) ranged from 7.9 +/- 1.3 mL plasma/cm(3) tissue in the cerebellum to 34.3 +/- 8.4 mL plasma/cm(3) tissue in the thalamus. Physostigmine induced a dose-dependent reduction of F-18-(-)-NCFHEB V-T/f(P) of 34 +/- 9% in the putamen, 32 +/- 8% in the thalamus, 25 +/- 8% in the cortex, and 23 +/- 10% in the hippocampus. With donepezil, F-18-(-)-NCFHEB V-T/f(P) was reduced by 24 +/- 2%, 14+3% and 14 +/- 5%, 10 +/- 6% in the same regions. Conclusion(18)F-(-)-NCFHEB can be used to detect changes in synaptic acetylcholine concentration and is a promising tracer to study acetylcholine dynamics with shorter scan durations than previous radioligands.

Characterization of epoxyeicosatrienoic acid binding site in U937 membranes using a novel radiolabeled agonist, 20-<SUP>125</SUP>I-14,15-epoxyeicosa-8(Z)-enoic acid	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							SOLUBLE EPOXIDE HYDROLASE; CORONARY SMOOTH-MUSCLE; A2 ADENOSINE RECEPTOR; DEPENDENT HYPERPOLARIZATION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; 14,15-EET BINDING; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; EXPRESSION	Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) are important regulators of vascular tone and homeostasis. Whether they initiate signaling through membrane receptors is unclear. We developed 20-iodo-14,15-epoxyeicosa-8(Z)-enoic acid (20-I-14,15-EE8ZE), a radiolabeled EET agonist, to characterize EET binding to membranes of U937 cells. 20-I-14,15-EE8ZE stimulated cAMP production in U937 cells with similar potency, but it decreased efficacy compared with 11,12-EET. Maximum cAMP production increased 4.2-fold, with an EC50 value of 9 mu M. Like 14,15-EET, 20-I-14,15-EE8ZE relaxed bovine coronary arteries, with a similar EC50 value. Both 20-I-14,15-EE8ZE agonist activities were blocked by the EET antagonist 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid ( 14,15-EE5ZE). Specific 20-I-125-14,15-EE8ZE binding to U937 membranes reached equilibrium within 10 min and remained unchanged for 30 min at 4 degrees C. The binding was saturable, reversible, and exhibited K D and B-max values of 11.8 +/- 1.1 nM and 5.8 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg protein, respectively. Pretreatment of the membranes with guanosine 5 '-O-(3-thio)triphosphate reduced the B-max in a concentration-related manner. 20-I-125-14,15-EE8ZE binding was inhibited by eicosanoids with potency order of 11,12-EET > 14,15-EE5ZE approximate to 14,15-EET >> 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid > 14,15-EET-thiirane > 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid. This order is in agreement with the efficacy and potency of cAMP production. In summary, 20-I-125-14,15- EE8ZE is a radiolabeled EET agonist that is useful to study binding and metabolism. Using this radioligand, we have identified a specific high-affinity and high-abundance EET binding site in U937 cell membranes. This binding site could represent a specific EET receptor, which is probably a G protein-coupled receptor.

MDA-MB-231 cells showed both a stimulation of adenylyl cyclase and a PLC-dependent increase in intracellular Ca2+ in response to nonselective adenosine receptor agonists. 3 Both adenosine-mediated responses in MDA-MB-231 cells were observed with the nonselective agonists 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) and 2-(3-hydroxy-3-phenyl) propyn-1-yladenosine5'- N-ethyluronamide (PHPNECA), but no responses were observed with agonists selective for A(1), A(2A) or A(3) adenosine receptors. The Ca2+ signal was antagonized by 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine ( DPCPX) and the nonselective antagonist 9-ethyl-8-furyladenine (ANR 152), but not by A(2A) or A(3) selective compounds. 4 In radioligand binding with [2-H-3](4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4] triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5] triazin-5-ylamino] ethyl) phenol) ([H-3]ZM 241385), a specific binding site with a K-D value of 87 nM and a B-max value of 1600 fmol mg(-1) membrane protein was identified in membranes from MDA-MB-231 cells. 5 The pharmacological characteristics provide evidence for the expression of an A(2B) adenosine receptor in MDA-MB-231 cells, which not only mediates a stimulation of adenylyl cyclase but also couples to a PLC-dependent Ca2+ signal, most likely via G(q/11). The A(2B) receptor in such cancer cells may serve as a target to control cell growth and proliferation. 6 The selective expression of high levels of endogenous A2B receptors coupled to two signaling pathways make MDA-MB-231 cells a suitable model for this human adenosine receptor subtype.

J	Warner, FJ; Mack, P; Comis, A; Miller, RC; Burcher, E				Warner, FJ; Mack, P; Comis, A; Miller, RC; Burcher, E			Structure-activity relationships of neurokinin A (4-10) at the human tachykinin NK<sub>2</sub> receptor:: the role of natural residues and their chirality	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						neurokinin A; structure-activity; human colon circular muscle; NK2 receptor; radioligand binding; retro-inverso	SUBSTANCE-P; AMINO-ACID; CIRCULAR MUSCLE; D-ENANTIOMER; HUMAN COLON; ANALOGS; BINDING; SUBSTITUTION; REPLACEMENT; ANTAGONISTS	A structure-activity study of neurokinin A (NKA) (4-10) was performed to investigate the importance of residue and chirality for affinity and efficacy at the NK2 receptor in human colon circular muscle. Two series of NKA(4-10) analogues were produced with either L-alanine or the D-enantiomer substituted. Their activities were determined in vitro by means of radioligand binding and isolated smooth muscle pharmacology. NKA was more potent than NKA(4-10) at the human, unlike the rabbit, NK2 receptor. The contractile response of NKA(4-10) was unaffected by N-terminal acetylation. L-Ala substitution of Asp(4), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) caused an 8- to 80-fold decrease, and substitution of Phe(6) caused a 5000-fold decrease in binding affinity (P < 0.01). Positions Ser(5) and Gly(8) were not significantly affected. In functional studies, a similar pattern was observed. The replacement of residues with their respective D-enantiomer drastically reduced binding affinity and functional potency, particularly at positions 6 and 7 (P < 0.05). NKA(4-10) analogues L-Ala(6), L-Ala(8), D-Phe(6), D-Val(7), and D-Met(10) were partial agonists. An excellent correlation was observed between binding and functional data (r = 0.95). A retro-inverso analogue of NKA(4-10) was inactive. In conclusion, the side chains of Asp(4), Phe(6), Val(7), Leu(9), and Met(10) are structurally important features of NKA(4-10) for agonist activity, and changes in amino acid chirality are detrimental to binding affinity and functional activity. Overall, our data are broadly similar to those of previous studies in the rat. However, at the human NK2 receptor, unlike the rat, [Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) was an antagonist. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study sought to assess kinetic model(s) as an alternative to 2TCM for quantifying [F-18]LSN3316612 binding, particularly in order to generate good-quality parametric images. Methods: The current study reanalyzed data from a previous study of 10 healthy volunteers who underwent both test and retest PET scans with [F-18]LSN3316612. Kinetic analysis was performed at the region level with 2TCM using 120-min PET data and arterial input function, which was considered as the gold standard. Quantification was then obtained at both the region and voxel levels using Logan plot, Ichise's multilinear analysis-1 (MA1), standard spectral analysis (SA), and impulse response function at 120 min (IRF120). To avoid arterial sampling, a noninvasive relative quantification (standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR)) was also tested using the corpus callosum as a pseudo-reference region. Venous samples were also assessed to see whether they could substitute for arterial ones. Results: Logan and MA1 generated parametric images of good visual quality and their total distribution volume (V-T) values at both the region and voxel levels were strongly correlated with 2TCM-derived V-T (r = 0.96-0.99) and showed little bias (up to - 8%). SA was more weakly correlated to 2TCM-derived V-T (r = 0.93-0.98) and was more biased (similar to 16%). IRF120 showed a strong correlation with 2TCM-derived V-T (r = 0.96) but generated noisier parametric images. All techniques were comparable to 2TCM in terms of test-retest variability and reliability except IRF120, which gave significantly worse results. Noninvasive SUVR values were not correlated with 2TCM-derived V-T, and arteriovenous equilibrium was never reached. Conclusions: Compared to SA and IRF, Logan and MA1 are more suitable alternatives to 2TCM for quantifying [F-18]LSN3316612 and generating good-quality parametric images.

Methods: A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the data of 13 patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA I&T (a PSMA inhibitor for imaging and therapy). The tumor, kidney, and salivary gland BEDs were simulated for TTVs of 0.1-10 L. The activity and peptide amounts leading to an optimal tumor-to-kidneys BED ratio were also investigated. Results: When the TTV was increased from 0.3 to 3 L, the simulated BEDs to tumors, kidneys, parotid glands, and submandibular glands decreased from 22 +/- 15 to 11.0 +/- 6.0 Gy(1.49), 6.5 +/- 2.3 to 3.7 +/- 1.4 Gy(2.5), 11.0 +/- 2.7 to 6.4 +/- 1.9 Gy(4.5), and 10.9 +/- 2.7 to 6.3 +/- 1.9 Gy(4.5), respectively (where the subscripts denote that an alpha/beta of 1.49, 2.5, or 4.5 Gy was used to calculate the BED). The BED to the red marrow increased from 0.17 +/- 0.05 to 0.32 +/- 0.11 Gy(15). For patients with a TTV of more than 0.3 L, the optimal amount of peptide was 273 +/- 136 nmol and the optimal activity was 10.4 +/- 4.4 GBq. Conclusion: This simulation study suggests that in patients with large PSMA-positive tumor volumes, higher activities and peptide amounts can be safely administered to maximize tumor BEDs without exceeding the tolerable BED to the organs at risk.

Population-Based Input Function Modeling for [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FMPEP-<i>d</i><sub>2</sub>, an Inverse Agonist Radioligand for Cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> Receptors: Validation in Clinical Studies	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL METABOLIC-RATE; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; PET; IMAGE; QUANTIFICATION; BINDING	Background: Population-based input function (PBIF) may be a valid alternative to full blood sampling for quantitative PET imaging. PBIF is typically validated by comparing its quantification results with those obtained via arterial sampling. However, for PBIF to be employed in actual clinical research studies, its ability to faithfully capture the whole spectrum of results must be assessed. The present study validated a PBIF for [F-18]FMPEP-d(2), a cannabinoid CB1 receptor radioligand, in healthy volunteers, and also attempted to utilize PBIF to replicate three previously published clinical studies in which the input function was acquired with arterial sampling. Methods: The PBIF was first created and validated with data from 42 healthy volunteers. This PBIF was used to assess the retest variability of [F-18]FMPEP-d(2), and then to quantify CB1 receptors in alcoholic patients (n = 18) and chronic daily cannabis smokers (n = 29). Both groups were scanned at baseline and after 2-4 weeks of monitored drug abstinence. Results: PBIF yielded accurate results in the 42 healthy subjects (average Logan-distribution volume (V-T) was 13.3 +/- 3.8 mL/cm(3) for full sampling and 13.2 +/- 3.8 mL/cm(3) for PBIF; R-2 = 0.8765, p < 0.0001) and test-retest results were comparable to those obtained with full sampling (variability: 16%; intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.89). PBIF accurately replicated the alcoholism study, showing a widespread similar to 20% reduction of CB1 receptors in alcoholic subjects, without significant change after abstinence. However, a small PBIF-V-T bias of -9% was unexpectedly observed in cannabis smokers. This bias led to substantial errors, including a V-T decrease in regions that had shown no downregulation in the full input function. Simulated data showed that the original findings could only have been replicated with a PBIF bias between -6% and +4%. Conclusions: Despite being initially well validated in healthy subjects, PBIF may misrepresent clinical protocol results and be a source of variability between different studies and institutions.

In order to facilitate the application of RGD-based positron emission tomography (PET) probes in the clinical setting we investigated in this study the feasibility of using the chelation reaction between (AlF)-F-18 and a macrocyclic chelator-conjugated dimeric RGD peptide as a simple one-step F-18 labeling strategy for development of a PET probe for tumor angiogenesis imaging. Methods Dimeric cyclic peptide E[c(RGDyK)](2) (RGD(2)) was first conjugated with a macrocyclic chelator, 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), and the resulting bioconjugate NOTA-RGD(2) was then radiofluorinated via (AlF)-F-18 intermediate to synthesize F-18-AlF-NOTA-RGD(2). Integrin binding affinities of the peptides were assessed by a U87MG cell-based receptor binding assay using I-125-echistatin as the radioligand. The tumor targeting efficacy and in vivo profile of F-18-AlF-NOTA-RGD(2) were further evaluated in a subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft model by microPET and biodistribution. Results NOTA-RGD(2) was successfully F-18-fluorinated with good yield within 40 min using the (AlF)-F-18 intermediate. The IC50 of F-19-AlF-NOTA-RGD(2) was determined to be 46 +/- 4.4 nM. Quantitative microPET studies demonstrated that F-18-AlF-NOTA-RGD(2) showed high tumor uptake, fast clearance from the body, and good tumor to normal organ ratios. Conclusion NOTA-RGD(2) bioconjugate has been successfully prepared and labeled with (AlF)-F-18 in one single step of radiosynthesis. The favorable in vivo performance and the short radiosynthetic route of F-18-AlF-NOTA-RGD(2) warrant further optimization of the probe and the radiofluorination strategy to accelerate the clinical translation of F-18-labeled RGD peptides.

Tumors such as prostate, small cell lung cancer, breast, gastric, and colon cancer are known to over express receptors to BBN and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). The goal of this study was to evaluate a new Ga-67 radiolabeled BBN analog based on the bifunctional chelating ligand DOTA (1, 4, 7, 10-tetraazacyclododecane-1, 4, 7, 10-tetraacetic acid), which could be used as a tool for diagnosis of GRP receptor-positive tumors. DOTA-GABA-BBN (7-14) NH2 was synthesized using a standard Fmoc strategy. Labeling with Ga-67 was performed at 95 degrees C for 30 minutes in ammonium acetate buffer (pH = 4.8). Radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and HPLC methods. The stability of radiopeptide was examined in the presence of human serum at 37 degrees C up to 24 hours. The receptor-bound internalization and externalization rates were studied in GRP receptor expressing PC-3 cells. Biodistribution of radiopeptide was studied in nude mice bearing PC-3 tumor. Labeling yield of >90% was obtained corresponding to a specific activity of approximate to 2.6MBq/nmol. Peptide conjugate showed good stability in the presence of human serum. The radioligand showed a good and specific internalization into PC-3 cells (16.13% +/- 0.71% at 4 hours). After 4 hours, a considerable amount of activity (52.42% +/- 1.86%) was externalized. In animal bio-distribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake of radioactivity was observed in GRP-receptor-positive organs. After 4 hours, the uptake in mouse tumor and pancreas was 1.30% +/- 0.18% ID/g (percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue) and 1.21% +/- 0.13% ID/g, respectively. These data show that [Ga-67]-DOTA-GABA-BBN (7-14) NH2 is a specific radioligand for GRP receptor positive tumors and is a suitable candidate for clinical studies.

Comparison of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]-(<i>R</i>)-PK 11195 and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28, two radioligands for translocator protein (18 kDa) in human and monkey: Implications for positron emission tomographic imaging of this inflammation biomarker	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Translocator protein (18 kDa); [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195; [C-11]PBR28; Positron emission tomography	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; PET RADIOLIGAND; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; NOMENCLATURE; RESISTANCE; INHIBITORS; BINDING; CLONING; GENE	Ten percent of humans lack specific binding of [C-11]PBR28 to 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker for inflammation. "Non-binders" have not been reported using another TSPO radioligand, [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195, despite its use for more than two decades. This study asked two questions: (1) What is the cause of nonbinding to PBR28? and (2) Why has this phenomenon not been reported using [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195? Methods: Five binders and five non-binders received whole-body imaging with both [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 and [C-11]PBR28. In vitro binding was performed using leukocyte membranes from binders and non-binders and the tritiated versions of the ligand. Rhesus monkeys were imaged with [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 at baseline and after blockade of TSPOs. Results: Using [C-11]PBR28, uptake in all five organs with high densities of TSPO (lung, heart, brain, kidney, and spleen) was 50% to 75% lower in non-binders than in binders. In contrast, [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 distinguished binders and non-binders in only heart and lung. For the in vitro assay, [H-3]PBR28 had more than 10-fold lower affinity to TSPO in non-binders than in binders. The in vivo specific binding of [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 in monkey brain was similar to 80-fold lower than that reported for [C-11]PBR28. Conclusions: Based on binding of [H-3]PK 11195 to leukocyte membranes, both binders and non-binders express TSPO. Non-binding to PBR28 is caused by its low affinity for TSPO in non-binders. Non-binding may be differentially expressed in organs of the body. The relatively low in vivo specific binding of [C-11]-(R)-PK 11195 may have obscured its detection of nonbinding in peripheral organs. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The structures were elucidated employing spectroscopic techniques (NMR, MS, LTV, and IR). The absolute stereochemistry of 1 and 2 was established by chemical degradation, derivatization, and chiral GC-MS analysis. Structures 4 and 5 are complex nucleosides containing rare methylthioadenosine and methylsulfinyladenosine moieties, respectively. In radioligand binding studies the 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine-2',3'-diester 4 exhibited affinity for A(1) and A(3) adenosine receptors with K-i values below 10 muM. Its affinity was somewhat lower for A(2A) (K-i = 17 muM) and much lower for A(2B) adenosine receptors. Analytical experiments using capillary electrophoresis showed that compound 4 was stable under the conditions of radioligand binding studies. Incubation with carboxylesterase resulted in slow hydrolysis of the adenosine derivative to 5'-deoxy-5'-methylthioadenosine (MTA), which was about 10-fold more potent at adenosine receptors than compound 4. Thus, the 2',3'-diester derivative 4 may act as a lipophilic prodrug of MTA in addition to its own adenosine receptor activity. GTP shift experiments indicated that the adenosine derivative was a partial agonist at At adenosine receptors of rat brain cortical membranes. Compound 4 inhibited cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell membranes recombinantly expressing the human A(3) adenosine receptor, thus indicating that the adenosine derivative also acted as a partial agonist at A(3)ARs. Homology models of the A(1) and the A(3) adenosine receptors in their putative active and inactive conformations were built and used for docking of the sterically demanding compound 4. It was found that this ligand fit well into the binding pockets of both receptor subtypes because of its highly flexible structure, although in somewhat different binding modes.

The A9E4 monoclonal antibody (moAb) against the epitope 1-29 of N-terminal of human GnRH-R has been proposed, suggesting the possibility to perform retrospective studies for the confirmation of clinical relevance of this receptor. The aim of the present study was to verify the performance of the A9E4 moAb when utilised for immunohistochemical analysis in 71 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded breast cancer samples; furthermore, a comparison with results obtained with the radioligand biochemical assay (GnRH-Rbca) and with Western blot has been performed. The A9E4 specificity was preliminarly demonstrated by Western blot analysis in both MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cell lines. In both cell lines, only a protein of 60-64 kDa was demonstrated in the membrane and nuclear compartments. Immuno-reactivity for A9E4 was detected in the cytoplasm of morphologically normal adjacent glandular epithelia and in tumour cells. Cytoplasmic GnRH-R immuno-staining (GnRH-Rica) was shown in 55% of tumours but only 28% of these had a percentage of positive cells higher than >25%. A correlation between the percentage of positive GnRH-Rica cells and femtomoles of the GnRH-Rbca content was shown (c.c.=0.295, p=0.01). The mean content of GnRH-Rbca in the subgroup of tumours with >25% of cell positive at GnRH-Rica was significantly different with respect to that of negative GnRH-Rica tumours (25 fmol vs 11 fmol, respectively; p=0.03 by t-test). The immunohistochemical analysis of GnRH-R by A9E4 moAb in human breast cancer tissues seems to provide information that correlates with the standard biochemical assay. Retrospective clinical studies with GnRH-Rica on archivial samples are strongly suggested to verify the prognostic-predictive relevance of this receptor in human breast cancer.

In normotensive rats, a single dose of oral omapatrilat (10 mg/kg) and 1 mg/kg inhibited plasma ACE (P <.01) for 24 h and increased plasma renin activity for 8 h (P <.01). In vitro autoradiography using the specific NEP inhibitor radioligand I-125-RB104 and the specific ACE inhibitor radioligand I-125-MK351A showed omapatrilat (10 mg/kg) caused rapid and potent inhibition of renal NEP and ACE, respectively, for 24 h (P <.01). In spontaneously hypertensive rats, 10 days of oral omapatrilat (40 mg/kg/day) reduced blood pressure (vehicle 237 +/- 4 mm Hg; omapatrilat, 10 mg/kg, 212 +/- 4 mm Hg; omapatrilat 40 mg/kg, 197 +/- 4 mm Hg, P <.01) in a dose-dependent manner (10 v 40:mg/kg, P <.01). Left ventricular hypertrophy was significantly reduced by high-dose omapatrilat (vehicle 2.76 +/- 0.03 mg/g body weight; omapatrilat, 10 mg/kg, 2.71 +/- 0.02 mg/g; omapatrilat 40 mg/kg, 2.55 +/- 0.02 mg/g, P <.01) and omapatrilat also increased kidney weight compared to vehicle (both doses, P <.01). Omapatrilat caused significant inhibition of plasma ACE and increased plasma renin activity (both doses, P <.01), and in vitro autoradiographic studies indicated sustained inhibition of renal ACE and NEP (both doses, P <.01). Omapatrilat is a potent vasopeptidase inhibitor, and its antihypertensive effects are associated with inhibition of NEP and ACE at the tissue level and beneficial effects on cardiovascular structure. Relating the degree of tissue inhibition to physiologic responses may allow further definition of the role of local renin angiotensin and natriuretic peptide systems in the beneficial effects of vasopeptidase inhibitors.

The successful production of [C-11]ABP688 in commercial automated synthesis module with hindered strong organic base was achieved. I compared 1,8-bis(tetramethylguanidino)naphthalene (TMGN), tert-butylimino-tri(pyrrolidino)phosphorane (BTPP), P2-tBu, P4-tBu, and NaH as a base for C-11 methylation of oxime and found P2-tBu would be a suitable alternative for the conventional inorganic bases (NaH or NaOH). Considering the GMP application, P2-tBu can provide compatibility with automated synthesizer and the resulting reliable synthesis. Three batches of the optimized condition for [C-11]ABP688 synthesis were examined for quality assurance.

Using a novel mouse model of NF1-associated attention deficit (ADD), we demonstrate a presynaptic defect in striatal dopaminergic homeostasis and leverage this finding to apply [(11)C]-raclopride positron-emission tomography (PET) in the intact animal. While methylphenidate and L-Deprenyl correct both striatal dopamine levels on PET imaging and defective attention system function in Nf1 mutant mice, pharmacologic agents that target de-regulated cyclic AMP and RAS signaling in these mice do not. These studies establish a robust preclinical model to evaluate promising agents for NF1-associated ADD. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods Patients with prostate cancer and neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) referred for PRRT and RLT, respectively, were enrolled in this study. The cardiac profiles of the patients were evaluated by a cardiologist and a cardiac history was obtained from all patients. Also, troponin I was measured before and 48 hours after treatment. Results In this retrospective study for assessment of RLT associated cardiotoxicity, 24 patients were evaluated with a median age of 64 years ( 27- 99 years) including 13 NET patients and 11 prostate cancer patients. Patients were followed up for 4 to 31 months which no cardiovascular problem was observed. In evaluation of troponin I, 39 RNT cycles were evaluated. In all patients, the value of troponin I was in normal range. In all patients, the median values of serum troponin I before and after treatment were 0.2 +/- 0.02 ( range: 0.000.42) and 0.28 +/- 0.02 (range: 0.00-0.46) ng/ml, respectively (p > 0.05). In the prostate cancer patients, the median values of serum troponin I before and after treatment were 0.26 +/- 0.04 (0.04-0.42) and 0.30 +/- 0.04 (0.00-0.41) ng/ml, respectively (p > 0.05). In the NET patients, the median values of serum troponin I before and after treatment were 0.18 +/- 0.03 (0.00-0.42) and 0.17 +/- 0.03 (0.00-0.46) ng/ml, respectively (p > 0.05). Conclusion PRRT with Lu-177-DOTATATE and RLT with Lu-177-PSMA as emerging therapeutic modalities have no significant cardiotoxicity. However, further well-designed studies are recommended.

Kinetic analysis of the translocator protein positron emission tomography ligand [<SUP>18</SUP>F]GE-180 in the human brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; IN-VIVO; 18 KDA; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; HEALTHY HUMANS; PET; BINDING; TSPO; RADIOLIGAND	PET can image neuroinflammation by targeting the translocator protein (TSPO), which is upregulated in activated microglia. The high nonspecific binding of the first-generation TSPO radioligand [C-11]PK-11195 limits accurate quantification. [F-18]GE-180, a novel TSPO ligand, displays superior binding to [C-11]PK-11195 in vitro. Our objectives were to: (1) evaluate tracer characteristics of [F-18]GE-180 in the brains of healthy human subjects; and (2) investigate whether the TSPO Ala147Thr polymorphism influences outcome measures. Ten volunteers (five high-affinity binders, HABs, and five mixed-affinity binders, MABs) underwent a dynamic PET scan with arterial sampling after injection of [F-18]GE-180. Kinetic modelling of time-activity curves with one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models and Logan graphical analysis was applied to the data. The primary outcome measure was the total volume of distribution (V (T)) across various regions of interest (ROIs). Secondary outcome measures were the standardized uptake values (SUV), the distribution volume and SUV ratios estimated using a pseudoreference region. The two-tissue compartment model was the best model. The average regional delivery rate constant (K (1)) was 0.01 mL cm(-3) min(-1) indicating low extraction across the blood-brain barrier (1 %). The estimated median V (T) across all ROIs was also low, ranging from 0.16 mL cm(-3) in the striatum to 0.38 mL cm(-3) in the thalamus. There were no significant differences in V (T) between HABs and MABs across all ROIs. A reversible two-tissue compartment model fitted the data well and determined that the tracer has a low first-pass extraction (approximately 1 %) and low V (T) estimates in healthy individuals. There was no observable dependency on the rs6971 polymorphism as compared to other second-generation TSPO PET tracers. Investigation of [F-18]GE-180 in populations with neuroinflammatory disease is needed to determine its suitability for quantitative assessment of TSPO expression.

Although it is accepted that other classic symptoms of PD such as rigidity and bradykinesia result from a degeneration of the nigrostriatal system and subsequent reduction in striatal dopamine, the pathophysiology of resting tremor remains unclear. The majority of recent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) studies, using various radioligands, demonstrated significant correlation between striatal radioligand bindings and the degree of parkinsonian symptoms such as rigidity and bradykinesia, but not tremor. We investigate the relationship between the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and the appearance of resting tremor, taking into account the possible interference of rigidity with the resting tremor. Thirty early and drug-naive PD patients were examined. Tremor and rigidity of the arms were assessed using UPDRS, and the power of tremor was estimated using spectral analysis of tremor peaks. [I-123]beta -CIT SPECT was used to assess degeneration of the dopaminergic system in PD patients. A comparison between asymmetry indices showed that in terms of both tremor and rigidity, the most affected arm corresponded significantly with the contralateral striatum, having the largest reduction in radioligand binding. Furthermore, tremor power accounted for a significant part of variance in the contralateral striatum, suggesting a relationship between this PD symptom and the degeneration of the dopaminergic system. Further, the degree of tremor was reduced with increasing rigidity. However, correcting for the influence of rigidity, the significant contribution of tremor in the variance in the contralateral striatal [I-123]beta -CIT binding disappeared. When the confounding influence of rigidity is taken into account, no significant direct relationship between dopaminergic degeneration and the degree of tremor could be found. Other pathophysiological mechanisms should be similarly investigated in order to further our understanding of the origin of resting tremor in PD. (C) 2001 Movement Disorder Society.

Methods: Twenty-one patients with known metastatic disease were staged with both conventional bone scanning and PSMA ligand scintigraphy within a time frame of less than 10 d. Imaging included planar whole-body scanning and SPECT or SPECT/CT with 2 bed positions 3 h after injection of either 500-750 MBq of Tc-99m-MIP-1427 or 600-750 MBq of Tc-99m-MDP. Lesions were scored as typical tumor, equivocal (benign/malignant), or normal within a standard reporting schema divided into defined anatomic regions. Masked and consensus readings were performed with sequential unmasking: planar scans first, then SPECT/CT, the best evaluable comparator (including MRI), PET/CT, and follow-up examinations. Results: Eleven patients had PSMA-positive visceral metastases that were predictably not diagnosed with conventional bone scanning. However, SPECT/CT was required to distinguish between soft-tissue uptake and overlapping bone. Four patients had extensive Tc-99m-MDP-negative bone marrow lesions. Seven patients had superscan characteristics on bone scans; in contrast, the extent of red marrow involvement was more evident on PSMA scans. Only 3 patients had equivalent results on bone scans and PSMA scans. In 16 patients, more suspect lesions were detected with PSMA scanning than with bone scanning. In 2 patients (10%), a PSMA-negative tumor phenotype was present. Conclusion: PSMA scanning provided a clear advantage over bone scanning by reducing the number of equivocal findings in most patients. SPECT/CT was pivotal for differentiating bone metastases from extraosseous tumor lesions.

However, the question of whether B1R and/or B2R have a role in cardiac myofibroblasts remains unanswered. Methods: CF were isolated from neonate rats and myofibroblasts were generated by an 84 h treatment with TGF-beta 1 (CMF). B1R was evaluated by western blot, immunocytochemistry and radioligand assay; B2R, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and cyclooxygenases land 2 (COX-1, and COX-2) were evaluated by western blot; intracellular Ca+2 levels were evaluated with Fluo-4AM; collagen secretion was measured in the culture media using the picrosirius red assay kit. Results: B2R, iNOS, COX-1 and low levels of B1R but not eNOS, were detected by western blot in CF. Also, B1 R, B2R, and COX-2 but not iNOS, eNOS or COX-1, were detected by western blot in CMF. By immunocytochemistry. our results showed lower intracellular B1R levels in CF and higher B1R levels in CMF, mainly localized on the cell membrane. Additionally, we found B1R only in CMF cellular membrane through radioligand displacement assay. Bradykinin (BK) B2R agonist increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and reduced collagen secretion both in CF and CMF. These effects were blocked by HOE-140, and inhibited by L-NAME, 1400W and indomethacin. Des-Arg-kallidin (DAKD) B1R agonist did not increase intracellular Ca2+ levels in CF: however, after preincubation for 1 h with DAKD and re-stimulation with the same agonist, we found a low increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Finally, DAKD increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and decreased collagen secretion in CMF, being this effect blocked by the B1R antagonist des-Arg9-Leu8-kallidin and indomethacin, but not by L-NAME or 1400W. Conclusion: B1R B2R, iNOS and COX-1 were expressed differently between CF and CMF, and collagen secretion was regulated differentially by kinin receptor agonists in cultured CF and CMF.

Positron emission tomography (PET), a high-resolution, sensitive, and noninvasive imaging technique, has been widely utilized in visualizing the localization of plaques and tangles and thereby distinguishing between AD and healthy controls. A small 12-mer D-enantiomeric peptide (amino acid sequence=QSHYRHISPAQV), denoted as D1, has high binding affinity to A beta in vitro in the sub-micromolar range, and consequently, its radiolabeled analogues have a potential as radioligands for visualizing amyloid plaques in vivo by PET. Aim: The aims of the present work were to develop three different potent D1 derivative peptides labeled with fluorine-18 and to examine them in the AD and control postmortem human brain by autoradiography (ARG). Methods: Three different D1 derivative peptides were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 ([F-18]ACI-87, [F-18]ACI-88, [F-18]ACI-89) using the prosthetic group N-succinimidyl-4-[F-18]fluorobenzoate ([F-18]SFB) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Preliminary ARG measurements were performed in AD and control brains. Results: The three fluorine-18-labeled D-peptides were obtained in a total synthesis time of 140 min with radiochemical purity higher than 98%. The specific radioactivities of the three different D1 derivative peptides were between 9 and 113 GBq/mu mol. ARG demonstrated a higher radioligand uptake in the cortical gray matter and the hippocampus in the AD brain as compared to age-matched control brain. Conclusions: Fluorine-18 labeling of the three novel D1 derivative peptides using [F-18]SFB was successfully accomplished. Higher contrast between AD and control brain slices demonstrates their potential applicability for further use in vivo by PET. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Novel D-amino acid tetrapeptides produce potent antinociception by selectively acting at peripheral κ-opioid receptors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						antinociception; kappa opioid agonist; peptides; peripheral; radioligand binding; rodent models	GASTROINTESTINAL TRANSIT; DELTA-RECEPTORS; MU-RECEPTORS; SPINAL-CORD; AGONIST; PAIN; INFLAMMATION; ANALGESIA; HUMANS; MOUSE	Kappa-(kappa) opioid receptors are widely distributed in the periphery and activation results in antinociception; however supraspinal acting kappa-agonists result in unwanted side effects. Two novel, all D-amino acid, tetrapeptide kappa-opioid receptor agonists, FE 200665 and FE 200666, were identified and compared to brain penetrating (enadoline) and peripherally selective (asimadoline) kappa-agonists as potential analgesics lacking unwanted central nervous system (CNS) side effects. In vitro characterization was performed using radioligand binding and GTP gamma S binding. Antinociception was evaluated in both mice and rats. Rotarod tests were performed to determine motor impairment effects of the kappa-agonists. FE 200665 and FE 200666 showed high affinity for human kappa-opioid receptor 1 (K-i of 0.24 nM and 0.08 nM, respectively) and selectivity for human kappa-opioid receptor 1 (human kappa-opioid receptor 1/human mu-opioid receptor/human delta-opioid receptor selectivity ratios of 1/16,900/84,600 and 1/88,600/> 1,250,000, respectively). Both compounds demonstrated agonist activity in the human kappa-opioid receptor 1 [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assay (EC50 of 0.08 nM and 0.03 nM) and resulted in dose-related antinociception in the mouse writhing test (A(50): 0.007 and 0.013 mg/kg, i.v., respectively). Markedly higher doses of FE 200665 and FE 200666 were required to induce centrally-mediated effects in the rotarod assay (548- and 182-fold higher doses, respectively), and antinociception determined in the mouse tail-flick assay (>1429- and 430-fold fold higher doses, respectively) after peripheral administration supporting a peripheral site of action. The potency ratios between central and peripheral activity suggest a therapeutic window significantly higher than previous kappa-agonists. Furthermore, FE 200665 has entered into clinical trials with great promise as a novel analgesic lacking unwanted side effects seen with current therapeutics. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: The affinity and relative efficacy were tested using radioligand-binding assay with muscarinic acetylcholine receptors from rat cerebral cortex. The pharmacological activities were assessed in three individual experiments: (1) potentiating the effect of subthreshold hypnotic dose of sodium pentobarbital; (2) inhibiting oxotremorine-induced salivation; and (3) inhibiting the contractile response to carbachol. Results: The order of potency of phencynonate hydrochloride and its optical isomers to inhibit the binding of [3 H]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([H-3]QNB) was R(-)-CPG (K-i=46.49 +/- 1.27 nmol/L)> CPG (K-i=271.37 +/- 72.30 nmol/L)> S(+)-CPG (K-i=1263.12 +/- 131.64 nmol/L). The results showed that R(-)-CPG had the highest affinity to central muscarinic receptors among the three compounds, but did not show any central depressant effects at dose from 10.00 to 29.15 mg/kg. CPG increased the effects of subthreshold hypnotic dose of sodium pentobarbital induced-sleeping [the ED50 +/- 95% LC value was 21.06 +/- 3.04 mg/kg]. CPG and R(-)-CPG displayed nearly equipotent effect in depressing oxotremorine-induced salivation [the ED50 +/- 95% LC for R(-) and CPG were 1.10 +/- 0.28 and 1.07 +/- 0.15 mg/kg, respectively], and the contractile response to carbachol (pA(2) values for R(-) and CPG were 6.84 and 6.80, respectively). S(+)-CPG presented the lowest anticholinergic profiles, but could potentate effects of its enantiomers in some manner. Conclusions: These data suggested that R(-)-CPG acted as an eutomer in racemate and a competitive antagonist to acetylcholine muscarinic receptors, but S(+)-CPG was less active in comparison to R(-)-CPG and its racemate. The central depressant effects of R(-)-CPG and S(+)-CPG were lower in comparison to its racemate.

The radiolabeled DAT ligand [H-3]GBR12935 was bound to peripheral lymphocytes in a manner consistent with the specific binding to a dopamine uptake system, with a dissociation constant similar to that found in striatum, but with a lower density of binding sites. On the other hand, no specific binding occurred in cerebellum used as a test tissue not expressing DAT. Western blot analysis using antibodies raised against amino or carboxy terminus of DAT or against VMAT-1 or VMAT-2 revealed labeling of single bands of approximately 76, 55 or 68 KDa, respectively, displaying similar migration characteristics in lymphocytes and test tissues used for comparison. Immunofluorescence revealed that anti-dopamine, anti-tyrosine hydroxylase, anti-DAT, anti-VMAT-1 and anti-VMAT-2 antibodies labeled the total population of cytospin-centrifuged lymphocytes mounted on microscope slides. Confocal laser microscopy demonstrated that dopamine and VMAT-2 immunoreactivity was developed mainly in cytoplasmic punctiform areas likely corresponding to vesicles and to a lower extent was associated to plasma membrane. Tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was diffused to cytoplasm and to plasma membrane of lymphocytes, whereas DAT and VMAT-1 immunoreactivity were located almost exclusively in lymphocyte plasma membrane and cytoplasm, respectively. Lymphocyte DAT characterized in this study has probably functional relevance as [H-3]dopamine was taken up by intact lymphocytes and uptake was inhibited specifically by compounds known to affect dopamine transport. These findings indicate that human peripheral blood lymphocytes possess DAT plasma membrane and VMAT-1 and VMAT-2 transporters. Increasing evidence indicates that dopamine transporter changes may be related to neuronal injury.

A diverse set of spirocyclic butanamides 4 (N-benzyl-4-(3,4-dihydrospiro[[2]benzopyran-1,4'-piperidin]-1'-yl)butanamides) was prepared by different combination of spirocyclic piperidines 8 (3,4-dihydrospiro[[2]benzopyran-1,4'-piperidines]) and gamma-halobutanamides 11. A key step in the synthesis of spirocyclic piperidines 8 was an Oxa-Pictet-Spengler reaction of beta-phenylethanols 5 with piperidone acetal 6. The substituted gamma-hydroxybutanamides 11c-e were prepared by hydroxyethylation of methyl acetates 13 with ethylene sulfate giving the gamma-lactones 14c and 14e. Aminolysis of the beta-lactones 14c and 14e with benzylamines provided the gamma-hydroxybutanamides 15c-e, which were converted into the bromides 11c-e by an Appel reaction using polymer-bound PPh3. In radioligand binding assays the spirocyclic butanamides 4 did not displace the iodinated radioligand I-125-CCL2 from the human CCR2. However, in the Ca2+-flux assay using human CCR2 strong antagonistic activity of butanamides 4 was detected. Analysis of the IC50-values led to clear relationships between the structure and the inhibition of the Ca2+-flux. 4g (4-(3,4-dihydrospiro[[2]benzopyran-1,4'-piperidin]-1'-yl)-N-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethylbenzyl)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)butanamide) and 4o (N-[3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]-2-cyclopropyl-4-(3,4-dihydrospiro[[2]benzopyran-1,4'-piperidin]-1'-yl) butanamide) represent the most potent CCR2 antagonists with IC50-values of 89 and 17 nM, respectively. Micromolar activities were found in the beta-arrestin recruitment assay with murine CCR2, but the structure-activity-relationships detected in the Ca2+-flux assay were confirmed.

Methods: [C-11]AZD9272 was labeled using palladium mediated C-11-cyanation. Altogether seven PET measurements were performed in three cynomolgus monkeys including baseline and co-injection experiments with unlabelled AZD9272 (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg). Radiometabolites in plasma were measured using HPLC. Results: [C-11]AZD9272 was prepared in over 50% incorporation yield from hydrogen [C-11]cyanide in a total synthesis time of 45-50 min. The radiochemical purity of the radioligand in its final formulation was high (>99%) and the mean specific radioactivity was 47 GBq/mu mol (1278 Ci/mmol, n=7) calculated at end of bombardment (EOB). In the baseline measurements 10% of the total injected radioactivity was present in monkey brain at five minutes after i.v. injection. The radioactivity concentration was high in the caudate, cingulate gyrus and thalamus whereas it was moderate in the temporal cortex and lower for the cerebellum. After co-injection with cold AZD9272 the binding of [C-11]AZD9272 was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion. Analysis of radiometabolites showed relatively slow metabolism and resulted only in hydrophilic radiometabolites. Conclusion: A fast and efficient method was developed to label AZD9272 with C-11. PET-examination in Cynomolgus monkeys showed that [C-11]AZD9272 entered the brain to a high extent, that binding was saturable and that the regional radioactivity pattern was in accordance with the known distribution of mGluR5. The results support further examination of [C-11]AZD9272 binding in human subjects. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

A homodimeric bivalent radioligand derived from 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine with high affinity for <i>in vivo</i> 5-HT1A receptor imaging	MEDCHEMCOMM			English	Article							TC-99M RADIOLIGAND; COMPLEXES; WAY-100635	The bivalent ligand approach is very promising and can give rise to molecular probes with enhanced conformational flexibility for tissue selective modulation. In this study we describe the synthesis of a homodimeric 5-HT1A receptor ligand by incorporating two identical pharmacophores, 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine, linked through DTPA. This bivalent derivative was efficiently synthesized and characterized by H-1, C-13 NMR and mass spectroscopy. Tc-99m-labeling was performed with a high radiolabeling yield (>95%) and radiochemical purity (>98%) using very low ligand concentration. In vitro studies were carried out on hippocampal cultures and PC3 cell lines which express 5-HT1A receptors. The selectivity of the complex for 5-HT1A receptors is 1000 times more than it is for 5-HT2A receptors, with K-d in picomolar range. Hill coefficients between 1.9 and 2.3 were observed, indicating that the homodimeric binding pharmacophores appear to be essential for the cooperative binding mode. In vitro binding assays in rat hippocampal cultures demonstrated the high affinity of the complex for 5-HT1A receptors. Further studies include in vivo organ distribution and gamma scintigraphy carried out in rat and rabbit. Plasma clearance rate (C-R) revealed a value of 4.86 mu g mL(-1) min(-1) in normal rabbit. Dynamic imaging performed in rabbit showed the beginning of radiolabeled uptake in brain as early as 2 min. The tumor-to-contralateral muscle tissue ratio of Tc-99m-DTPA-bis(MPBA) in athymic mice with PC3 xenograft was found to be 65 +/- 3.3 at 1 h. Significant accumulation was seen in mice and rat brain at 10 min with 2.07 +/- 0.76% ID g (1) and 2.81% ID g (1) respectively. The high uptake in hippocampus and cerebral cortex was accredited to the 5-HT1A receptor rich regions in post mortem rat brain. This imaging agent holds a promising future in imaging 5-HT1A receptors for the effective diagnosis of neuropathological disorders.

A Biomathematical Modeling Approach to Central Nervous System Radioligand Discovery and Development	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						positron emission tomography; imaging; radioligand; biomathematical modeling; radiochemistry	IN-VIVO; BINDING; BLOOD; RECEPTORS; RAT; VITRO; PERMEABILITY; RADIOTRACERS; PREDICTION; PROFILE	The development of a successful PET or SPECT molecular imaging probe is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process that suffers from high attrition. To address this problem, we have developed a biomathematical modeling approach that aims to predict the in vivo performance of radioligands directly from in silico/in vitro data. Methods: The method estimates the in vivo nondisplaceable and total uptake of a ligand in a target tissue using a standard input function and a 1-tissue-compartment model with a parsimonious parameter set (influx rate constant K-1, efflux rate constant k(2), and binding potential BPND) whose values are predicted from in silico/in vitro data including lipophilicity, molecular volume, free fraction in plasma and tissue, target density, affinity, perfusion, capillary surface area, and apparent aqueous volume in plasma and tissue. The coefficient of variation of the BPND (%COV[BPND]) metric, derived from Monte Carlo simulations, is used to estimate the in vivo performance of candidate compounds. A total of 28 compounds for 10 targets was evaluated using our method to predict their in vivo performance and validated against measured in vivo PET data in the Yorkshire/Danish Landrace pig. Results: The predicted K-1, k(2), and BPND values were generally consistent with the values estimated from in vivo PET data. The model resulted in small %COV[BPND] values for widely accepted good ligands such as C-11-flumazenil (2.02%) and C-11-raclopride (2.55%), whereas higher values resulted from poor ligands such as C-11-(R)-PK11195 (13.34%). Of 4 candidates for the GlyT1 transporter, the model selected C-11-GSK931145 (2.11%) as the most promising ligand, which was consistent with historical decisions made on the in vivo PET data. Conclusion: A biomathematical modeling approach has the potential to predict the in vivo performance of ligands from in silico/in vitro data and aid in the development of molecular imaging probes.

Kinetic evidence for tandemly arranged ligand binding sites in melanocortin 4 receptor complexes	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						melanocortin receptors; radioligand binding; dimetization; [(125) I]THIQ; tandem binding site; kinetic model	DRUG DISCOVERY	The melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) binding of the peptide analogue of melanocyte stimulating hormone, [I-125]NDP-MSH, and the low molecular weight radionucleid 1-(D-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxy-D-4-(125)iodophenylalanyl)-4-cyclohexyl-4-[(1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)methyl]piperidine trifluoroacetate ([I-125]THIQ) were compared. Kinetic analysis indicated heterogeneity in the binding of both radioligands, the binding apparently proceeding to two tandemly arranged interconnected mutually dependent binding sites. Steric considerations and BRET analysis of Rluc and GFP tagged receptors proposed that these sites are located on different subunits of receptor dimers, which form receptor complexes. According to the minimal model proposed, ligand binding proceeds consecutively to the two binding sites of the dimer. After binding of the first ligand conformational transformations of the complex occur, which is followed by binding of the second ligand. When both receptor units have bound [I-125]NDP-MSH, the radioligand can be released only from one unit. The [I-125]NDP-MSH bound to the remaining unit stays practically irreversibly bound due to a very slow retransformation rate of the transformed complex. The considerably faster binding of [(125) I]THIQ did not allow accurate kinetic differentiation of the two binding sites. However, addition of NDP-MSH as well as a fragment of the human agouti protein, hAGRP(83-132) to the preformed [I-125]TIUQ-MC4R complex drastically retarded the release of [I-125]THIQ from the complex, blocking conformational transformations in the complex by binding into the second binding site. The consecutive binding of ligands to the MC4R dimers has substantial impact on the apparent ligand potencies, when determined in competition with the two different radioligands applied herein; the apparent potencies of the same ligand differing up to three orders of magnitude when assayed in competition with [I-125]NDP-MSH or [I-125]THIQ.

The neurotrophic activity of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), an extracellular factor present in the retina, is mediated by binding to cell-surface receptors in responsive cell cultures. In the present study, the expression of PEDF receptors in native neural retinas from adult steers was examined. METHODS. Binding reactions were performed with I-125-PEDF and fluoresceinated PEDF using plasma membranes, detergent-soluble membrane proteins, or cryosections of retina from adult bovine eves. Radioligand-binding and competition analyses were performed with a computer-assisted program. Ligand blot analysis of detergent-soluble membrane proteins was performed with I-125-PEDF followed by autoradiography. Ligand-affinity column chromatography of detergent-soluble membrane proteins was performed with PEDF-coupled resin followed by SDS-PAGE. Binding of fluoresceinated PEDF to retina cryosections was detected by confocal microscopy. RESULTS. Radioligand-binding assays showed that I-125-PEDF bound in a specific and saturable fashion to one class of sites on retina membranes (K-d = 2.5-6.5 nM: maximum binding [B-max] = 1-48 X 10(10) sites/retina). A peptide of 44 amino acids (44-mer), identified as the receptor-binding region of PEDF, competed efficiently for I-125-PEDF binding to retina membranes with kinetics similar to the full-length PEDF. Ligand blot analysis and ligand-affinity chromatography revealed a specific and high-affinity PEDF-binding protein of similar to 85 kDa in retina plasma membranes. Confocal microscopy showed that fluorescein-conjugated PEDF stained exclusively the inner segments of photoreceptors and cells of the ganglion cell layer in retinal cryosections. CONCLUSIONS. Altogether, these data conclusively demonstrate the existence of PEDF receptors discretely distributed on the surface of cells from the adult neural retina of bovine eyes. Furthermore, they provide evidence for the direct action of PEDF on photoreceptor and ganglion cell neurons and an anatomic basis for studies to assess PEDF neurotrophic effects on the adult retina.

Endocannabinoids - Endogenous agonists of cannabinoid receptors. Endocannabinoids are derived from long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. The family of endogenous agonists for CB1 receptors is larger than initially thought. The first-discovered and best-studied endocannabinoids are anandamide (N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine) and 2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG). Newly proposed endocannabinoids are 2-arachidonylglyceryl ether (noladin, 2-AGE), O-arachidonoylethanolamine (virodhamine), and N-arachidonoyldopamine (NADA). The physiological functions for these compounds have not yet been established. Hemopressin was recently identified as an endogenous CB1 receptor antagonist. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) - A large protein family of transmembrane receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate intracellular signal-transduction pathways and, ultimately, cellular responses. Most processes of signal transduction involve ordered sequences of biochemical reactions inside the cell, which are carried out by enzymes, activated by second messengers, resulting in a signaltransduction pathway. Such processes are usually rapid, lasting on the order of milliseconds in the case of ion flux, or minutes for the activation of protein-and lipid-mediated kinase cascades.

Its 35 gamma S-labeled radioligand [35S] GTP gamma S is used to evaluate the functional activity of G-protein-coupled receptors. Immunohistochemistry - The process of localizing proteins in cells using the principle of antibody binding to specific antigens in biological tissues. For immunohistochemical evaluation of receptor localization, an antibody is developed that selectively binds to the C-or N-terminal regions of the receptor. The antibody is typically tagged with a flurophore and, thus, the antibody distribution in tissue can be visualized by fluorescence analysis. Nociception - The neural processes of encoding and processing noxious stimuli and is produced in the peripheral and central nervous system by stimuli that have the potential to damage tissue. This activity is initiated by nociceptors (also called pain receptors) that can detect mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli. Once stimulated, a nociceptor transmits a signal along the spinal cord, to the brain. Nociception triggers a variety of autonomic responses and may also result in the experience of pain. Orexigenic - Increasing or stimulating the appetite. Psychoactive (or psychotropic) drugs - Chemical substances that act primarily upon the central nervous system to alter brain function, resulting in temporary changes in perception, mood, consciousness, and behavior. These drugs may be used recreationally - to purposefully alter one's consciousness - or therapeutically as medication. Because psychoactive substances bring about subjective changes in consciousness and mood that the user may find pleasant (e. g., euphoria) or advantageous (e. g., increased alertness), many psychoactive substances are abused, that is, used excessively, despite risks or negative consequences. With sustained use of some substances, physical dependence may develop, making the cycle of abuse even more difficult to interrupt. Radioligand binding - Evaluates the distribution of a selective receptor ligand (agonist or antagonist) that has been tagged with a radioactive moiety such as tritium [3H]. Radioligand distribution is typically evaluated by apposing prepared brain slices with X-ray film that, thus, produces a density image of the radiotracer presence throughout the tissue.

Binding of Specific Ligand by D2-and NMDA-Receptors of Striatum Cells in Two Rat Strains Predisposed and Resistant to Audiogenic Seizures	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Krushinsky-Molodkina strain; audiogenic seizures; radioligand binding; dopamine receptors; NMDA-receptors		We studied parameters of specific receptor binding of D2-dopamine receptor ligand [H-3]-sulpiride and NMDA-receptor ligand [H-3]-MK-801 on the membranes of striatum cells in Krushinsky-Molodkina rats (predisposed to audiogenic seizures) and strain "0" selected for the absence of audiogenic seizures. No interstrain differences were observed in affinity (K-d) of both D2- and NMDA-receptors to ligands. At the same time, significant interstrain differences in receptor density (B-max) were found for both D2-receptors and NMDA-receptors. The reduced number of dopamine and glutamate receptors in the striatum can be associated with neurological peculiarities of Krushinsky-Molodkina rat strain (audiogenic seizures and postictal catalepsy).

As the best-described cannabinoid receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), those will be the focus of this chapter. We will start with a basic review of GPCR signaling, as these concepts are critical to understanding the function of cannabinoid receptors. Next, several features of cannabinoid receptor signaling will be presented, with an emphasis on the effectors modulated by cannabinoid receptors. Finally, we will finish with a discussion of cannabinoid receptor agonists and antagonists and future directions. The aim of this chapter is to introduce the cannabinoid receptor pharmacology that will be necessary to appreciate the intricacies of endocannabinoid signaling presented in later chapters.

Pathological studies however indicate more widespread neuronal degeneration in the familial form. We performed I-123-FP-CIT SPET (DaTSCAN) study in nine patients with familial PD carrying the a-synuclein (G209A) mutation and fifteen matched patients with sporadic disease. Both groups had equal radioligand reduction uptake in the striatum but the a-synuclein patients showed less asymmetry and increased putamen to caudate ratio. Our findings indicate that there are minor differences in DAT SPET parameters between a-synuclein and sporadic PD patients insufficient to provide differential diagnosis.

The FLAG-tagged M-2 muscarinic receptor was incorporated onto the surface of the Lipobead by incubating pre-Lipobeads with proteoliposomes containing the receptor. Receptors reconstituted onto the surface of the Lipobeads were functional in that they bound the antagonists quinuclidinylbenzilate and scopolamine with characteristic muscarinic affinities. This demonstrates the feasibility of using Lipobeads to study the binding properties of the M-2 muscarinic receptor and offers a promising approach to the study of transmembrane protein biology in general.

Radiolabeling and in vivo evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]AGH-44: a potential lead structure to develop a positron emission tomography radioligand for the 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptor	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						AGH-44; 5-HT7; PET; Carbon-11	BRAIN; SYSTEM	AGH-44 is described as a selective low-basicity serotonin 7 receptor (5-HT7R) agonist. In this paper, we evaluate if AGH-44 can act as a lead structure to develop a 5-HT7R selective positron emission tomography (PET) tracer. C-11-labeling of AGH-44 succeeded in a two-step, one-pot procedure in good yields. Subsequent PET studies showed that [C-11]AGH-44 displays low blood-brain-barrier passage in Long-Evans rats. Moreover, [C-11]AGH-44 brain accumulation showed to be independent on permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux inhibition. Results from biodistribution and metabolism studies could neither explain the observed low brain uptake. As such, we believe that this scaffold is not an optimal starting point to develop a 5-HT7R selective PET tracer.

The molecular selectivity of the colloidosomes was investigated by radioligand binding analysis, which indicated that the inter-particle click reaction did not affect the molecular specificity of the MIP nanoparticles on the colloidosomes for the model template, propranolol. Besides specific molecular recognition of the MIP nanoparticles, the colloidosomes also displayed dose-dependent fluorescence response to fructose at physiological pH. Moreover, the immobilized boronic acid in the core could effectively bind isoproterenol, a template analogue containing a catecholamine moiety. The depletion of isoproterenol from solution allowed the MIP nanoparticles on the colloidosomes to bind propranolol more efficiently. The pre-designed molecular selectivity and fluorescence response of the colloidosomes are interesting for potential applications in controlled delivery, chemical sensing and bioseparation.

Potential drug abuse therapeutics derived from the hallucinogenic natural product salvinorin A	MEDCHEMCOMM			English	Article							SALVIA-DIVINORUM; KAPPA-OPIOIDS; RECEPTOR; ANALOGS	Previous structure activity relationship studies of salvinorin A have shown that modification of the acetate functionality off the C-2 position to a methoxy methyl or methoxy ethyl ether moiety leads to increased potency at KOP receptors. However, the reason for this increase remains unclear. Here we report our efforts towards the synthesis and evaluation of C-2 constrained analogs of salvinorin A. These analogs were evaluated at opioid receptors in radioligand binding experiments as well as in the GTP-gamma-S functional assay. One compound, 5, was found to have affinity and potency at kappa opioid (KOP) receptors comparable to salvinorin A. In further studies, 5 was found to attenuate cocaine-induced drug seeking behavior in rats comparably to salvinorin A. This finding represents the first example of a salvinorin A analog that has demonstrated anti-addictive capabilities.

Influence of a Low Dose of Amphetamine on Vesicular Monoamine Transporter Binding: A PET (+)[<SUP>11</SUP>C]DTBZ Study in Humans	SYNAPSE			English	Article						vesicular monoamine transporter II; positron emission tomography; dihydrotetrabenazine; amphetamine; dopamine	VMAT2 BINDING; RELEASE	We previously reported increased binding of (+)[C-11]DTBZ (dihydrotetrabenazine), the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, in striatum of some methamphetamine users. This finding might be explained by stimulant-induced vesicular DA depletion resulting in decreased DA (+)[C-11]DTBZ competition at VMAT2. In a prospective PET study, we now find that administration of an acute oral dose of amphetamine (0.4 mg/kg) to humans does not cause increased striatal (+)[C-11]DTBZ binding but a slight 5% decrease. Our data suggest that a low amphetamine dose is unlikely to cause sufficient DA depletion to detect increased (+)[C-11]DTBZ binding and that a higher dose might be required. Synapse 64:417-420, 2010.

It was found that 5-HTT sites in the temporal cortex of AD patients with prominent antemortem anxiety were unaltered compared with controls, but were reduced in non-anxious AD subjects. Furthermore, homozygosity for the high activity allele of a functional polymorphism in the 5-HTT gene promoter region (5-HTTLPR) was associated with both increased [H-3]citalopram binding and occurrence of anxiety in the AD subjects. Since serotonin-synthesizing neurons are known to be lost in the AD cortex, this study suggests that the preservation of 5-HTT may exacerbate serotonergic deficits and underlie anxiety symptoms in AD.

We have performed radioligand binding assays on rat cortical membranes and functional studies on rat aortic rings. Instead the relaxant activity exhibited by (R)-apomorphine, o-quinones 2, 4, show contractile activity dependent on endothelium in rat aortic rings. Compound 2, the main metabolite of (R)-apomorphine auto-oxidation, was the product which showed enhanced contractile activity by a complex mechanism related to activation of Ca2(+) channels through release and/or inhibition of endothelial factors. Moreover, this compound disrupts the endothelial function as shows the lack of response to acetylcholine observed in vessels pretreated with it.

Zitter mutant rats exhibiting a heterogeneous loss of striatal DA innervation were examined for DA transporter (DAT) binding and DA D-3 receptor number by autoradiography and compared with Sprague-Dawley rats. A significant loss of DAT binding was observed with the greatest in the lateral caudate-putamen (72% loss) and the least in the nucleus accumbens (45% loss). DA D-3 receptors were reduced by >70% in all regions, even in the nucleus accumbens that exhibited considerably smaller depletions of DAT binding, indicating that loss of D-3 receptors may occur prior to massive loss of DA innervation.

The results showed that the transmembrane domain (TMD) VI-VII of the vasopressin V1a receptor, in particular the amino acid residue Ala-342 in TMD VII, is the major component conferring the rat-selective binding of OPC-21268 to the V1a receptor.

Since GPCRs are transmembrane proteins, receptorsamples for binding assays are prepared from tissue sections, cellmembranes, cell homogenates, or intact cells. As part of our investigationson modulating the pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled peptides for improvedtheranostic targeting of neuroendocrine tumors with a high abundanceof the somatostatin receptor sub-type 2 (SST2), we characterizeda series of Cu-64-labeled [Tyr(3)]octreotate (TATE)derivatives in vitro in saturation binding assays. Herein, we reporton the SST2 binding parameters measured toward intact mousepheochromocytoma cells and corresponding cell homogenates and discussthe observed differences taking the physiology of SST2 andGPCRs in general into account. Furthermore, we point out method-specificadvantages and limitations.

As evaluated by radioligand binding assays, imprinted polymers prepared in acetonitrile were very specific for testosterone because the nonimprinted control polymers bound virtually no radiolabeled testosterone. The polymers present an appreciable affinity, with association constants of K(a) = 3.3 x 10(7) M(-1) (high-affinity binding sites). The binding characteristics of the polymers were also evaluated in aqueous environment to study their viabilities as alternatives to antibodies in molecularly imprinted sorbent assays. Compared with the testosterone-specific antibodies present in commercial kits, our molecularly imprinted polymers are somewhat less sensitive but show a high selectivity.

Two tracers showed the same brain distribution. Brain uptake of [(11)C]MPDX (Ki = 4.2 nM) was much higher and washed out faster than that of [(11)C]KF15372 (Ki = 3.0 nM), and was blocked by carrier-loading or displaced with an A(1) antagonist. The regional A(1) receptor distribution evaluated with kinetic analysis is consistent with that previously measured in vitro. [(11)C]MPDX PET has a potential for mapping adenosine A(1) receptors in brain. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Fibroblast activation protein-a expression in fibroblasts is common in the tumor microenvironment of colorectal cancer and may serve as a therapeutic target	PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH			English	Article						colorectal cancer; tumor microenvironment; cancer-associated fibroblasts; fibroblast-activation protein; radioligand therapy	PATIENT; PET/CT; FAP	Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is still one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, emphasizing the need for further diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. Cancer invasion and metastasis are affected by the tumor microenvironment (TME), with cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) being the predominant cellular component. An important marker for CAF is fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP) which has been evaluated as therapeutic target for, e.g., radioligand therapy. The aim of this study was to examine CRC regarding the FAP expression as a candidate for targeted therapy. Methods: 67 CRC, 24 adenomas, 18 tissue samples of inflammation sites and 28 non-neoplastic, non-inflammatory tissue samples of colonic mucosa were evaluated for immunohistochemical FAP expression of CAF in tissue microarrays. The results were correlated with clinicopathological data, tumor biology and concurrent expression of additional immunohistochemical parameters. Results: 53/67 (79%) CRC and 6/18 (33%) inflammatory tissue specimens showed expression of FAP. However, FAP was only present in 1/24 (4%) adenomas and absent in normal mucosa (0/28). Thus, FAP expression in CRC was significantly higher than in the other investigated groups. Within the CRC cohort, expression of FAP did not correlate with tumor stage, grading or the MSI status. However, it was observed that tumors exhibiting high immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67, CD3, p53, and beta-Catenin showed a significantly higher incidence of FAP expression. Conclusion: In the crosstalk between tumor cells and TME, CAF play a key role in carcinogenesis and metastatic spread. Expression of FAP was detectable in the majority of CRC but nearly absent in precursor lesions and non-neoplastic, non-inflammatory tissue. This finding indicates that FAP has the potential to emerge as a target for new diagnostic and therapeutic concepts in CRC. Additionally, the association between FAP expression and other immunohistochemical parameters displays the interaction between different components of the TME and demands further investigation.

Preclinical investigations and first-in-human application of <SUP>152</SUP>Tb-PSMA-617 for PET/CT imaging of prostate cancer	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Tb-152; Terbium; PSMA-617; PET; CT imaging; Theragnostics; Prostate cancer	IN-VIVO; THERAPY; TB-161; LU-177; RADIONUCLIDES	BackgroundFor almost a decade, terbium radioisotopes have been explored for their potential theragnostic application in nuclear medicine: Tb-152 and Tb-155 are the radioisotopes identified for PET or SPECT imaging, while Tb-149 and Tb-161 have suitable decay characteristics for alpha- and combined beta(-)/Auger-e(-)-therapy, respectively. In the present study, the application of Tb-152, in combination with PSMA-617 for imaging of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive prostate cancer, was demonstrated in a preclinical setting and in a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).Results(152)Tb was produced at the ISOLDE facility at CERN/Geneva, Switzerland, by spallation, followed by on-line mass separation. The chemical separation was performed at Paul Scherrer Institute using chromatographic methods, as previously reported. Tb-152 was employed for labeling PSMA-617, and the radioligand was extensively investigated in vitro to demonstrate similar characteristics to its Lu-177-labeled counterpart. Preclinical PET/CT imaging studies performed with mice enabled visualization of PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumors, while uptake in PSMA-negative PC-3 flu tumors were absent. Based on these promising preclinical results, Tb-152 was shipped to Zentralklinik Bad Berka, Germany, where it was used for labeling of PSMA-617, enabling PET imaging of a patient with mCRPC. PET/CT scans were performed over a period of 25h post injection (p.i.) of the radioligand (140MBq). The images were of diagnostic quality, particularly those acquired at later time points, and enabled the detection of the same metastatic lesions and of local recurrent tumor as previously detected by Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT acquired 45min p.i.ConclusionsThe results of this study demonstrate the successful preparation and preclinical testing of Tb-152-PSMA-617 and its first application in a patient with mCRPC. This work could pave the way towards clinical application of other Tb radionuclides in the near future, most importantly Tb-161, which has promising decay characteristics for an effective treatment of mCRPC patients.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]DPA-714 PET imaging of translocator protein TSPO (18 kDa) in the normal and excitotoxically-lesioned nonhuman primate brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; Translocator protein 18 kDa TSPO; PET imaging; [F-18]DPA-714; Quinolinate; Nonhuman primate	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; TIME-COURSE; RADIOLIGAND; BINDING; MICROGLIA; LIGAND; CNS; NEUROINFLAMMATION	We aimed to characterize pharmacologically the TSPO- radioligand [F-18]DPA-714 in the brain of healthy cynomolgus monkeys and evaluate the cellular origin of its binding in a model of neurodegeneration induced by intrastriatal injection of quinolinic acid (QA). [F-18]DPA-714 PET images were acquired before and at 2, 7, 14, 21, 49, 70, 91 days after putaminal lesioning. Blocking and displacement studies were carried out (PK11195). Different modelling approaches estimated rate constants and V (T) (total distribution volume) which was used to measure longitudinal changes in the lesioned putamen. Sections for immunohistochemical labelling were prepared at the same time-points to evaluate correlations between in vivo [F-18]DPA-714 binding and microglial/astrocytic activation. [F-18]DPA-714 showed a widespread distribution with a higher signal in the thalamus and occipital cortex and lower binding in the cerebellum. TSPO was expressed throughout the whole brain and about 73 % of [F-18]DPA-714 binding was specific for TSPO in vivo. The one-tissue compartment model (1-TCM) provided good and reproducible estimates of V (T) and rate constants, and V (T) values from the 1-TCM and the Logan approach were highly correlated (r (2) = 0.85). QA lesioning induced an increase in V (T), which was +17 %, +54 %, +157 % and +39 % higher than baseline on days 7, 14, 21 and 91 after QA injection, respectively. Immunohistochemistry revealed an early microglial and a delayed astrocytic activation after QA injection. [F-18]DPA-714 binding matched TSPO immunopositive areas and showed a stronger colocalization with CD68 microglia than with GFAP-activated astrocytes. [F-18]DPA-714 binds to TSPO with high specificity in the primate brain under normal conditions and in the QA model. This tracer provides a sensitive tool for assessing neuroinflammation in the human brain.

The affinities of these compounds for adenosine A(1)/A(2A) receptors were determined at 1 mu M concentration. The test compounds which exhibited more than 20% inhibition were selected and further screened at six different concentration levels to estimate their EC50/K-i values. The most potent compounds in the series were 4c and 4d having an ethyl side chain at C-5 position with dimethyl and cyclohexyl substitution at the C-8-C-9 positions, exhibiting K-i values of 2.1 and 1.1 mu M, respectively, at A(1)ARs. The SAR indicates that by increasing or decreasing the alkyl chain length at C5 led to reduced affinity. The remaining aryl/arylalkyl derivatives of the series were inactive showing that a simple alkyl side chain at C5 is necessary for these ligands to bind at A(1)ARs. However, none of the compounds showed inhibition on A(2A) receptors at 1 mu M concentration indicating their selectivity. This communication describes the design, synthesis and evaluation of these new molecules. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The complete open reading frame for this propeptide is comprised in two exons that are localized on chromosome 23. zfPDYN cDNA codes for a polypeptide of 252 amino acids that contains the consensus sequences for four opioid peptides: an Ile-enkephalin, the neo-endorphins, dynorphin A and dynorphin B. Upon comparison between zebrafish (zfDYN A) and mammalian dynorphin A (mDYN A) it has been stated that these two peptides only differ in two amino acids: the Leu(5) is replaced by Met(5) and the Lys(13) by Arg(13). Taking into consideration that mDYN A is able to bind to the three mammalian opioid receptors, we have compared the pharmacological profile of zfDYN A and mDYN A on the zebrafish opioid receptors. By means of radioligand binding techniques, we have established that these two dynorphins bind and activate all of the cloned oploid receptors from zebrafish (delta-, mu- and kappa-like), although with different affinities. zfDYN A and mDYN A displace [H-3]-diprenorphine binding with K-i values on the nanomolar range, showing greater affinity for zebrafish opiold receptor (ZFOR) 3 (kappa) receptor. ZFOR1 (delta) and ZFOR4 (delta) present higher affinity for zfDYN A than for mDYN A, while the opposing behavior is observed in ZFOR2 (mu). Functional [S-35]guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP gamma S) stimulation experiments indicate that these two peptides fully activate the zebrafish opioid receptors, although the mean effective dose (EC50) values obtained for ZFOR2 and ZFOR3 receptors are lower than those seen for ZFOR1 and ZFOR4. A comparative study indicates that mammalian and zebrafish opiold receptors might bind their corresponding dynorphin A in a similar fashion, hence suggesting an important role of the opiold system through the vertebrate evolution.

Seven nAChR subunits (four alpha-type and three beta-type) have been cloned previously from Drosophila melanogaster, the model insect system and characterized by heterologous expression. Recently, three further putative nAChR alpha subunits (Dalpha5, Dalpha6 and Dalpha7) with sequence similarity to the vertebrate alpha7 subunit have been identified from Drosophila genome sequence data but there have been no reports, as yet, of their characterization by heterologous expression. In the present study, we report the first isolation of a full-length Dalpha7 cDNA and the independent molecular cloning of Dalpha6. Binding of nicotinic radioligands was not detected to full-length Dalpha6 or Dalpha7 subunits when expressed alone or when or co-expressed with other nAChR subunits in Drosophila or mammalian cell lines, but specific cell-surface binding of [(125)I]alpha-bungarotoxin (K(d) = 0.68 +/- 0.22 nM) and [(3)H]methyllycaconitine (K(d) = 0.27 +/- 0.06 nM) was detected after expression of a subunit chimera containing the ligand-binding domains of Dalpha6 fused to the C-terminal domain of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 5HT(3A). Although cell-surface binding was not detected with a Dalpha7/5HT(3A) chimera expressed alone, co-expression of the two subunit chimeras resulted in significantly enhanced levels of nicotinic radioligand binding (with no change in affinity). This is the first evidence for the formation of a nAChR binding site by heterologously expressed Drosophila nAChR subunits in the absence of a co-expressed vertebrate nAChR subunit. In addition to the formation of homomeric nAChR complexes, evidence has been obtained from both radioligand binding and co-immunoprecipitation studies for the co-assembly of Dalpha6 and Dalpha7 into heteromeric cell surface complexes.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vivo selectivity of [C-11]-beta-CPPIT and to determine whether [C-11]-beta-CPPIT may be a suitable alternative to existing DAT PET radioligands. [C-11]-beta-CPPIT was prepared by N-alkylation of the free amine with [C-11]methyl iodide. In mouse brain, the striatal binding of [C-11]-beta-CPPIT was reduced significantly by preinjecting the dopamine reuptake antagonist GBR 12909 (5 mg/kg). By contrast, radioactivity uptake in the brain was not affected significantly by the preinjection of citalopram (5 mg/kg) and desipramine (5 mg/kg), inhibitors for the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, respectively. No effect was also observed by pretreatment with ketanserin (2.5 mg/kg) a compound with high affinity for the 5-HT2A-receptor and the vesicular monoamine transporter. In a PET study with six healthy volunteers high striatal uptake was observed. The distribution pattern of [C-11]-beta-CPPIT was similar to the known distribution of the dopamine transporter in the human brain. Compared to I-123 labeled beta-CIT, the rate of metabolic degradation of [C-11]-beta-CPPIT was almost twofold slower suggesting that bioisosteric heterocyclic substitution of the ester group at the 2beta-position of the tropane ring does have an influence on the rate of metabolism of [C-11]-beta-CPPIT. The rank order of the distribution volumes obtained via the one-tissue compartment model is also similar to the reported distribution of DAT. These preliminary results suggest that [C-11]-beta-CPPIT may be a useful PET radioligand for the visualization and quantification of dopamine transporters in man. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

The most appealing series contain imidazole, 1,2,4-triazole, or benzimidazole rings fused to the 2,3-positions of the parent diazinone core. The optimization process enabled identification of a highly potent (3.49 nM) A(2B) ligand that exhibits complete selectivity toward A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptors. The results of functional cAMP experiments confirmed the antagonistic behavior of representative ligands. The main SAR trends identified within the series were substantiated by a molecular modeling study based on a receptor-driven docking model constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of the human A(2A) receptor.

Reactions often used in aromatic tritiation, such as halogination and catalytic halogen/tritium displacement, are adversely affected by the presence of the divalent sulfur moeity. By protecting the SH group with t-butyl group, the tritiation reaction proceeded smoothly without catalyst poisoning. The mercapto functionality was re-generated with great ease and efficiency using 2-nitrobenzenesulfenyl chloride and dithiothreitol (DTT). [(3)H]-Thiorphan, thus, obtained had a radiochemical purity of >99% by AN-HPLC and a specific activity of 18.42 Ci/mmol. [(3)H]-Thiorphan showed good stability when stored at 4 degrees C in an aqueous solution containing 10% methanol and 0.2% DTT in the dark.

Structure based design of subtype selective D2R antagonists requires high resolution crystal structures of the receptor and pharmacological tools promoting a better understanding of the protein-ligand interactions. Recently, we reported the development of a chemically activated dopamine derivative (FAUC150) designed to covalently bind the L94C mutant of the dopamine D-2 receptor. Using FAUC150 as a template, we elaborated the design and synthesis of irreversible analogs of the potent antipsychotic drug haloperidol forming covalent D2R-ligand complexes. The disulfide- and Michael acceptor-functionalized compounds showed significant receptor affinity and an irreversible binding profile in radioligand depletion experiments. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

These receptors have been implicated in the CNS system as therapeutic targets in applications such as psychosis, reduction of body weight or Alzheimer's disease. As part of our efforts to develop 5-HT6 antagonists, we explored the benzothiazolone scaffold substituted in position 3 or 6 respectively with ethylamino chains and an aromatic ring connected through a sulfonyl linker. Final compounds were evaluated in radioligand binding assays for their ability to interact with 5-HT6 receptors. Their potential cytotoxic effects were determined on the human neuroblastoma cell line SY5Y. They showed very low cytotoxicity, and one of them has submicromolar affinity for 5-HT6 receptors.

Studies were done using an equilibrium infusion technique to provide estimates of specific binding as distribution volume ratios. Anesthesia with either isoflurane or sodium pentobarbital produced a significant (65-90%) increase of radiotracer binding in receptor-rich brain regions (striatum, cortex, hippocampus) relative to awake controls. Pretreatment of anesthetized animals with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor phenserine produced no further increases in radioligand binding, in contrast to the large (> 70%) increases previously observed in awake animals following drug treatment. These studies demonstrate that anesthesia can produce significant changes in baseline biochemical measures that can obscure even very large effects of pharmacological challenges.

The extract at doses 20 and 100 mg/kg, i.p. significantly (p < 0.001) reduced the spontaneous locomotor activity and at 100 mg/kg, increased the thiopental-induced sleeping time. In rota-rod motor co-ordination test, ST at 100 mg/kg, i.p. significantly (p < 0.05-0.01) reduced the endurance time. Further ST exhibited no protection against maximal electroshock (MES)- and pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced convulsions in mice. In receptor radioligand binding studies, ST exhibited affinity towards dopaminergic, alpha-adrenergic and muscarnic receptors. The findings suggest that, ST may possess principles with potential neuroleptic properties. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To further improve the ligand affinity, fluspidine analogs were systematically synthesized and screened herein. To design the modified ligand analogs, a docking simulation of the protein-ligand complex structure was examined. By using the developed synthetic strategy involving asymmetric catalytic 1,4-reduction of alpha,beta-unsaturated carboxylic esters catalyzed by a chiral cobalt complex, 20 candidates of modified fluspidines were synthesized. The structure-activity relationships showed the development of a hybridized modified fluspidine. In addition, the inhibitory rate could be improved from 45% to 71%. This result demonstrates the importance of the development of a new synthetic method towards improving the ligand performance by providing a series of analogs. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of High and Low Affinity Serotonin 1A Receptors by PET In Vivo in Nonhuman Primates	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR); positron emission tomography; brain imaging	5-HT1A RECEPTORS; C-11-CUMI-101; RADIOLIGAND; BRAIN	Serotonin (5-HT) 1A receptors exist in high and low affinity states. Agonist ligands bind preferentially to the high affinity state receptors, providing a more functionally relevant measure than antagonist binding. We now report comparison of 5-HT1A binding in vivo using both [C-11]CUM1-101 (agonist) and [C-11]WAY100635 (antagonist) in nonhuman primates. PET studies show that both tracers bind to known 5-HT1A receptor (5-HT1AR)-rich regions of baboon brain. The binding (BPF) of [C-11]CUMI-101 was lower on an average of 55% across the regions of interest (ROIs) compared to [C-11]WAY100635. This ratio is consistent with the in vitro binding data of agonist and antagonist 5-HT1AR ligands previously reported.	[Kumar, J. S.

The radiochemical yield of 2* was 82 +/- 4%, and the purity exceeded 98%. The specific activity was 33 +/- 19 GBq/mumol. Affinities for rat, pig and human A, adenosine receptors (A(1)ARs) were in the low nanomolar range, but poor selectivity for the human A(1)AR over the A(2A)AR was found. Additionally, in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographic studies revealed high unspecific binding which makes this ligand unsuitable for SPELT imaging. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In order to evaluate these compounds, hepatocytes from both human and rat were utilized to produce metabolites and LC-MS-MS was used to identify metabolites. These in vitro metabolism studies indicate that hydrolysis of the amide linkage is the major metabolism pathway for humans, whereas aromatic ring-oxidation is the major metabolism pathway for rat. The rat hepatocyte results correlate well with in vivo rat metabolism studies. Based on the structures of the metabolites, we have developed an extraction procedure to determine the concentration of the parent compound in plasma. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

The oldest and most prominent field of application of theranostics in oncology is differentiated thyroid cancer treated by radioiodine therapy, which allows imaging of the iodine uptake and thus tumor manifestations by gamma (gamma) radiation of radioiodine. Other areas of application include neuroendocrine tumors, castration-resistant prostate cancer and, in the context of individual therapeutic approaches, fibroblastic tumors. Imaging with beta-plus (beta(+)) emitters is mainly performed using so-called hybrid imaging: positron emission tomography (PET) in combination with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (PET/CT or PET/MRI). Beta-minus (beta(-)) emitters are predominantly used in therapy, but the use of alpha (alpha) emitters is also increasing, thus, enabling targeted cancer treatment with mostly low-grade side effects.

Here, photochromic affinity switches based on a drugable benzimidazole core through azologization and computational studies are developed. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) lead to compounds with high selectivity over hCB(1)R that can be reversibly switched to a higher affinity cis-form proved on the receptor level by radioligand binding studies and translating into an affinity change in a functional GTP. S assay. cAMP ELISA and the change in expression level of two genes regulated by CREB proves that the compounds act as partial agonists.

Lateralization of dopaminergic neurotransmission in striata from different hemispheres occurs in patients, but also in healthy individuals. Our data show that the affinity of dopamine binding to dopamine D-1 receptors is significantly higher in left than in right striatum. Analysis of data from radioligand binding to striatal samples from na < ve, 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned, levodopa-treated and levodopa-induced dyskinetic rats shows differential receptor structure and gives hints on the causes of right/left lateralization of dopamine binding to striatal D-1 receptors. Moreover, binding data showed loss of lateralization in levodopa (L-DOPA)-induced dyskinetic rats.

Biosensor-based affinities and binding kinetics of small molecule antagonists to the adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor reconstituted in HDL like particles	FEBS LETTERS			English	Article						Surface plasmon resonance; G protein-coupled receptor; Residence time; Lipid disc	MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; DISCOVERY; IDENTIFICATION; RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; NANODISCS; LIGANDS; POTENT	The options for investigating solubilised G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by biophysical techniques have long been hampered by their instability. A thermostabilised adenosine A(2A) receptor expressed in insect cells, purified in detergent and reconstituted into high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles was immobilised onto a Surface Plasmon Resonance sensor chip. This allowed measurement of affinities and kinetics for A(2A) antagonists with affinities ranging from 50 pM to almost 2 mu M. Compared with other formats, reproduction of affinities, and dissociation and association rate constants are good, reasonable and poor respectively, indicating stabilised receptors in HDL particles are useful for investigating specific aspects of GPCR-ligand interactions.

Preliminary biological assays have shown that these compounds have a relatively high affinity for opioid receptors, achieving >= 94% inhibition of radioligand binding at a concentration of 10 mu M in non-selective opioid binding assays. Further testing on two of the analogues, 9a and 9b, demonstrated that these compounds were acting as agonists, rather than antagonists, at the opioid receptors and 9b achieved the significant result of 73% inhibition of contractile responses in the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum assay at a concentration of 30 mu M. Unfortunately, none of the molecules showed evidence of transdermal activity.	[Young, Jacqui F.; Thienthong, Neeranat; Hearn, Milton T. W.; Robinson, Andrea J.; Jackson, W.

In the present work a series of 8-bromo-9-alkyl adenines are prepared and fully characterized in radioligand binding assays or functional cyclase experiments in respect to their interaction with all the four adenosine receptor subtypes. Results show that the presence of the bromine atom in 8-position of 9-substituted adenines promotes in general the interaction with the adenosine receptors, in particular at the A(2A) subtype. The present study also demonstrates that adenine derivatives could be a good starting point to obtain selective adenosine A(2B) receptor antagonists. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Expression of estrogen receptors-alpha and -beta was most often detected in ER+PR+ tumors and most significantly decreased in these neoplasms after exemestane therapy. Immunocytochemical and radioligand assays showed that tamoxifen and anastrozole have little effect on the number of estrogen receptors-alpha. The number of progesterone receptors in tumors decreased by the end of anastrozole therapy. Estrogen receptors-beta were immunocytochemically revealed in 50% primary breast tumors. Anastrozole slightly decreased, while tamoxifen increased the incidence of these receptors. Interruption of signaling through estrogen receptors and suppression of estrogen biosynthesis had different effects on the receptor status of neoplasms and distribution of estrogen receptors-alpha and -beta.

Both plasma input models and reference tissue input models are considered. General theory is derived and the systems are characterized in terms of their impulse response functions. The theory shows that the macro parameters of the system may be determined simply from the coefficients of the impulse response functions. These results are discussed in the context of radioligand binding studies. It is shown that binding potential is simply related to the integral of the impulse response functions for all plasma and reference tissue input models currently used in PET. This article also introduces a general compartmental description for the behavior of the tracer in blood, which then allows for the blood volume-induced bias in reference tissue input models to be assessed.

Methods: HTK03161, HTK03149 and HTK03189A/B were obtained by replacing Glu in HTK03041 with Asp, Aad (L-2-aminoadipic acid) and Api (2-aminopimelic acid), respectively. PSMA binding affinities were measured by competition binding assays. PET imaging and biodistribution studies of Ga-68-labeled ligands were performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. The best candidate HTK03149 was selected and radiolabeled with Lu-177, and SPECT imaging and biodistribution studies were performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. Radiation dosimetry calculation was conducted using the OLINDA software. Radioligand therapy study was performed in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice treated with [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03149 (9.3-148 MBq), [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 (37 MBq) or natu-HTK03149 (500 pmol). Results: PSMA binding affinities (K) of Ga-HTK03161, Ga-HTK03149, Ga-HTK03189A and Lu-HTK03149 were 3.88 +/- 0.66, 6.99 +/- 0.80, 550 +/- 35.7 and 1.57 +/- 0.42 nM, respectively. PET imaging showed that all Ga-68-labeled HTK03161, HTK03149 and HTK03189A/B were excreted mainly via the renal pathway and had minimal uptake in all organs/tissues including kidneys and salivary glands. Tumor xenografts were clearly visualized in PET images of [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03161 and [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03149 but were barely visualized using [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03189A/B. Tumor uptake values for [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03161, [Ga-68] Ga-HTK03149, [Ga-68]Ga-HTK0189A and [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03189B were 12.7 +/- 1.91, 19.1 +/- 6.37, 2.10 +/- 0.28 and 0.67 +/- 0.15 %IA/g, respectively at 1h post-injection, and their average kidney and salivary gland uptake values were 2.13-4.41 and 0.20-0.23 %IA/g, respectively. Longitudinal SPECT imaging studies showed that [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03149 was excreted mainly through the renal pathway with high uptake in LNCaP tumors and minimal uptake in all normal organs/tissues. The tumor uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03149 peaked at 4h post-injection (20.9 +/- 2.99 %IA/g) and the uptake was sustained over time. Compared to [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03149 had 145% increase in tumor absorbed dose but 70% less in kidney absorbed dose, leading to an 7.1-fold increase in tumor-to-kidney absorbed dose ratio. Radioligand therapy studies showed that only half of the [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 injected dosage was needed for [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03149 to achieve the same median survival. Conclusion: Replacing Glu in the PSMA-targeting Lys-urea-Glu pharmacophore of [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03041 with Asp and Aad generates [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03161 and [Ga-68]Ga-HTK03149, respectively, and the new derivatives retain high uptake in LNCaP tumors and have minimal uptake in normal organs/tissues including kidneys and salivary glands. [Lu-177]Lu-HTK03149 also retain high uptake in LNCaP tumors and has minimal uptake in normal organs/tissues, and is, therefore, promising for clinical translation to treat prostate cancer.

Among these derivatives, the fluoropropyl ester of beta -CIT (19), the fluoroethyl ester of beta -CIT (20), the N-fluoropropyl derivative of beta -CBT (12), and the fluoropropyl ester of beta -CMT (18) displayed higher affinity and greater selectivity for the DAT versus SERT and NET than FP-CIT, which indicates that they are attractive candidates for the development of F-18-labeled PET imaging agents for the DAT.

With both modalities it is possible to image and, especially with PET, to measure regional tissue function, the particular function being interrogated depending on the actual tracer being used. In the second part, the use of PET for neuroactivation studies is presented, illustrated with some key examples from the literature using both perfusion and metabolism tracers. It is argued that the future of PET (and SPECT) neuroactivation studies lies in the use of ligands. Possible approaches For performing ligand activation studies are discussed.

An efficient new method for the synthesis of 3-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluoro-4-aminopyridine via Yamada-Curtius rearrangement	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						aminopyridine; F-18; multiple sclerosis; PET; Yamada-Curtius rearrangement	NUCLEOPHILIC AROMATIC-SUBSTITUTION; PET	4-Aminopyridine is a clinically approved drug to improve motor symptoms in multiple sclerosis. A fluorine-18-labeled derivative of this drug, 3-[F-18]fluoro-4-aminopyridine, is currently under investigation for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of demyelination. Herein, the Yamada-Curtius reaction has been successfully applied for the preparation of this PET radioligand with a better radiochemical yield and improved specific activity. The overall radiochemical yield was 5 to 15% (n=12, uncorrected) with a specific activity of 37 to 148GBq/mol (end of synthesis) in a 90minute synthesis time. It is expected that this 1 pot Yamada-Curtius reaction can be used to prepare similar fluorine-18-labeled amino substituted heterocycles.

A Suzuki coupling of an indoleborate ester to the pyrimidine electrophile was utilized to form the natural product and derivatives thereof. The 3-pyrimidineindoles were found to prevent radioligand binding to several CNS receptors and transporters, most notably, serotonin receptors (<0.2 mu M K-i for 5HT(2B)). Two compounds also inhibited the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum (IC50 <50 mu M). Only the natural product was cytotoxic toward A549 cells (IC50 = 15 mu M). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

More than 8.7 million 3D structures derived from different vendor databases were investigated by docking to the hH4R binding site using FlexX. A total of 255 selected compounds were tested by radioligand binding assay and 16 of them possessed significant [H-3]histamine displacement. Several novel scaffolds were identified that can be used to develop selective H4 ligands in the future.

An acidic (pH 6) and hypotonic buffer is a conventional, well-known buffer for prostaglandin E(2) receptor binding assays. CJ-023,423 showed moderate binding affinity for human EP(4) receptor under conventional buffer conditions. However, its binding affinity was greatly increased under neutral (pH 7.4) and isotonic buffer conditions.

Patients with no or low expression of SSTR2 are not candidates for PRRT. SSTR2 promotor undergoes epigenetic modification, known to regulate gene expression. We investigated whether the demethylation agent, guadecitabine, could enhance the expression of SSTR2 in NET models, using radioligand uptake/PET imaging as a biomarker of epigenetic modification. Methods: The effects of guadecitabine on the transcriptional, translational, and functional regulation of SSTR2 both in vitro and in vivo using low (QGP-1) and high (BON-1) methylated neuroendocrine neoplasia models was characterised. Promotor region methylation profiling of clinical samples (n = 61) was undertaken. Safety of combination guadecitabine and PRRT was assessed in vivo. Results: Pyrosequencing of cell lines illustrated differential methylation indices - BON: 1 94%, QGP: 1 21%. Following guadecitabine treatment, a dose-dependent increase in SSTR2 in BON-1 at a transcriptional, translational, and functional levels using the SSTR2-directed radioligand, F-18-FET-beta AG-TOCA ([F-18]-FETO) (150% increase [F-18]-FETO uptake, p < 0.05) was observed. In vivo, guadecitabine treatment resulted in a 70% increase in [F-18]-FETO uptake in BON-1 tumour models compared models with low baseline percentage methylation (p < 0.05). No additive toxicity was observed with the combination treatment of PRRT and guadecitabine in vivo. Methylation index in clinical samples was 10.5% compared to 5.2% in controls (p = 0.03) and correlated with SSTR2 expression (Wilcoxon rank sign -3.75,p < 0.01). Conclusion: Guadecitabine increases SSTR2 expression both in vitro and in vivo. The combination of demethylation agents with PRRT warrants further investigation.

Mohamed M. and Zeng Z et al. report that astrogliosis is common with aging in a region-specific manner. Here, C-11-BU99008 PET does not differentiate these patients from healthy controls. The role of astrogliosis in the pathology of brain aging and neurodegenerative diseases has recently drawn great attention. Imidazoline-2 binding sites represent a possible target to map the distribution of reactive astrocytes. In this study, we use C-11-BU99008, an imidazoline-2 binding sites-specific PET radioligand, to image reactive astrocytes in vivo in healthy controls and patients with established Parkinson's disease dementia. Eighteen healthy controls (age: 45-78 years) and six patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (age: 64-77 years) had one C-11-BU99008 PET-CT scan with arterial input function. All subjects underwent one 3 T MRI brain scan to facilitate the analysis of the PET data and to capture individual cerebral atrophy. Regional C-11-BU99008 volumes of distribution were calculated for each subject by the two-tissue compartmental modelling. Positive correlations between C-11-BU99008 volumes of distribution values and age were found for all tested regions across the brain within healthy controls (P < 0.05); furthermore, multiple regression indicated that aging affects C-11-BU99008 volumes of distribution values in a region-specific manner. Independent samples t-test indicated that there was no significant group difference in C-11-BU99008 volumes of distribution values between Parkinson's disease dementia (n = 6; mean age = 71.97 +/- 4.66 years) and older healthy controls (n = 9; mean age = 71.90 +/- 5.51 years). Our data set shows that astrogliosis is common with aging in a region-specific manner. However, in this set-up, C-11-BU99008 PET cannot differentiate patients with Parkinson's disease dementia from healthy controls of similar age.

Pharmacological Characterization of the αvβ6 Integrin Binding and Internalization Kinetics of the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Derived Peptide A20FMDV2	PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						alpha v beta 6 integrin; A20FMDV2; Latency associated peptide-1; Binding kinetics; Internalization kinetics	INTEGRIN-ALPHA-V-BETA-6; INHIBITION; CANCER; ALPHA(V)BETA(6); INFLAMMATION; FIBRONECTIN; EXPRESSION; MIGRATION; FIBROSIS; RECEPTOR	A20FMDV2 is a peptide derived from the foot-and-mouth disease virus with a high affinity and selectivity for the alpha-v beta-6 (alpha v beta 6) arginyl-glycinyl-aspartic acid (RGD)-binding integrin. It has been shown to be an informative tool ligand in pre-clinical imaging studies for selective labelling of the alpha v beta 6 integrin in a number of disease models. In a radioligand binding assay using a radiolabelled form of the peptide ([H-3] A20FMDV2), its high affinity (K-D : 0.22 nmol/l) and selectivity (at least 85-fold) for alpha v beta 6 over the other members of the RGD integrin family was confirmed. [H-3] A20FMDV2 alpha v beta 6 binding could be fully reversed only in the presence of EDTA, whereas a partial reversal was observed in the presence of excess concentrations of an RGD-mimetic small molecule (SC-68448) or unlabelled A20FMDV2. Using flow cytometry on bronchial epithelial cells, the ligand-induced internalization of alpha v beta 6 by A20FMDV2 and latency-associated peptide-1 was shown to be fast (t(1/2): 1.5 and 3.1 min, respectively), concentration-dependent (EC50 : values 1.1 and 3.6 nmol/l, respectively) and was followed by a moderately slow return of integrin to the surface. The results of the radioligand binding studies suggest that the binding of A20FMDV2 to the RGD-binding site on alpha v beta 6 is required to maintain its engagement with the hypothesised A20FMDV2 synergy site on the integrin. In addition, there is evidence from flow cytometric studies that the RGD-ligand engagement of alpha v beta 6 post-internalization plays a role in delaying recycling of the integrin to the cell surface. This mechanism may act as a homeostatic control of membrane alpha v beta 6 following RGD ligand engagement. (C) 2016 S.

NEUROANATOMICAL DISTRIBUTION OF OXYTOCIN AND VASOPRESSIN 1a RECEPTORS IN THE SOCIALLY MONOGAMOUS COPPERY TITI MONKEY (<i>CALLICEBUS CUPREUS</i>)	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						neuropeptides; receptor binding; nonhuman primate; neuroanatomy; monogamy; pair bonding	FLANK-MARKING BEHAVIOR; UPPER SPINAL-CORD; BINDING-SITES; MATERNAL-BEHAVIOR; MESSENGER-RNA; PARTNER PREFERENCE; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; V-1A RECEPTOR; HUMAN BRAIN	The coppery titi monkey (Callicebus cupreus) is a socially monogamous New World primate that has been studied in the field and the laboratory to investigate the behavioral neuroendocrinology of primate pair bonding and parental care. Arginine vasopressin has been shown to influence male titi monkey pair-bonding behavior, and studies are currently underway to examine the effects of oxytocin on titi monkey behavior and physiology. Here, we use receptor autoradiography to identify the distribution of arginine vasopressin 1a receptor (AVPR1a) and oxytocin receptors (OXTR) in hemispheres of titi monkey brain (n = 5). AVPR1a are diffuse and widespread throughout the brain, but the OXTR distribution is much more limited, with the densest binding being in the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus, CA1 field) and the presubiculum (layers I and Ill). Moderate OXTR binding was detected in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, pulvinar, superior colliculus, layer 4C of primary visual cortex, periaqueductal gray (RAG), pontine gray, nucleus prepositus, and spinal trigeminal nucleus. OXTR mRNA overlapped with OXTR radioligand binding, confirming that the radioligand was detecting OXTR protein. AVPR1a binding is present throughout the cortex, especially in cingulate, insular, and occipital cortices, as well as in the caudate, putamen, nucleus accumbens, central amygdala, endopiriform nucleus, hippocampus (CA4 field), globus pallidus, lateral geniculate nucleus, infundibulum, habenula, RAG, substantia nigra, olivary nucleus, hypoglossal nucleus, and cerebellum. Furthermore, we show that, in the titi monkey brain, the OXTR antagonist ALS-II-69 is highly selective for OXTR and that the AVPR1a antagonist SR49059 is highly selective for AVPR1a. Based on these results and the fact that both ALS-II-69 and SR49059 are non-peptide, small-molecule antagonists that should be capable of crossing the blood brain barrier, these two compounds emerge as excellent candidates for the pharmacological manipulation of OXTR and AVPR1a in future behavioral experiments in titi monkeys and other primate species.

Although initially launched as distinct from stimulants that increase extracellular dopamine by targeting dopamine transporters, recent preclinical studies suggest otherwise. Objective To measure the acute effects of modafinil at doses used therapeutically (200 mg and 400 mg given orally) on extracellular dopamine and on dopamine transporters in the male human brain. Design, Setting, and Participants Positron emission tomography with [C-11] raclopride (D-2/D-3 radioligand sensitive to changes in endogenous dopamine) and [C-11] cocaine (dopamine transporter radioligand) was used to measure the effects of modafinil on extracellular dopamine and on dopamine transporters in 10 healthy male participants. The study took place over an 8-month period (2007-2008) at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Main Outcome Measures Primary outcomes were changes in dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor and dopamine transporter availability (measured by changes in binding potential) after modafinil when compared with after placebo. Results Modafinil decreased mean (SD) [C-11] raclopride binding potential in caudate (6.1% [6.5%]; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5% to 10.8%; P = .02), putamen (6.7% [4.9%]; 95% CI, 3.2% to 10.3%; P = .002), and nucleus accumbens (19.4% [20%]; 95% CI, 5% to 35%; P = .02), reflecting increases in extracellular dopamine. Modafinil also decreased [C-11] cocaine binding potential in caudate (53.8% [13.8%]; 95% CI, 43.9% to 63.6%; P < .001), putamen (47.2% [11.4%]; 95% CI, 39.1% to 55.4%; P < .001), and nucleus accumbens (39.3% [10%]; 95% CI, 30% to 49%; P = .001), reflecting occupancy of dopamine transporters. Conclusions In this pilot study, modafinil blocked dopamine transporters and increased dopamine in the human brain ( including the nucleus accumbens). Because drugs that increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens have the potential for abuse, and considering the increasing use of modafinil, these results highlight the need for heightened awareness for potential abuse of and dependence on modafinil in vulnerable populations.

A simplified method for the measurement of nonmetabolized 2-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]F-A-85380 in blood plasma using solid-phase extraction	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						positron emission tomography; 2-[F-18]F-A-85380; plasma; solid-phase extraction; nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; PARKINSON-DISEASE; DRUG DISCOVERY; PET; BRAIN; QUANTIFICATION; ALPHA4BETA2; NONSMOKERS; TARGETS; SMOKERS	Quantification of alpha(4)beta(2)* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors using 2-[F-18]fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2-[F-18]FA) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging requires measurement of nonmetabolized radioligand in blood plasma, which was previously accomplished using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Here, we introduce a one-step solid-phase extraction (SPE) method for measuring the concentration of nonmetabolized 2-[18F]FA. This method allows many samples to be processed in a short period of time. SPE effectively separated 2-[F-18]FA from radioactive metabolites typically observed in blood plasma after administration of radioligand in humans. Measurements of the 2-[F-18]FA parent fraction in healthy human volunteers obtained using the SPE method were nearly identical to those obtained using HPLC (1.3 +/- 5% average underestimation of SPE), and reproducibility was good within and between runs (2% and 6% coefficient of variation, respectively). SPE recovery of 2-[18F]FA from blood plasma was not appreciably diminished (3 +/- 0.6%) by a larger volume of blood plasma loaded onto the cartridge, suggesting the possibility of increasing the plasma sample volume at later times in a PET study to improve measurement sensitivity. 2-[F-18]FA was stable in blood stored on ice over 8 h and in saline at low concentrations (< 2 MBq/ml) but not at high concentrations (ca. 130 MBq/ml). Using SPE, the elimination half-life and full body distribution volume of 2-[F-18]FA in healthy human volunteers were estimated as 4.2 +/- 0.8 h and 220 +/- 70 L, respectively. These results suggest that SPE is the method of choice for the determination of the plasma 2-[18F]FA concentration when measurement of individual metabolites is not required. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A for long identified goal is to produce detailed parametric maps of showing neuroreceptor binding parameters for the entire human brain in vivo. The application of wavelet filters has recently been proposed as a solution to handle the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio of PET images. In the present study we applied the wavelet approach to data obtained from 10 healthy subjects who were examined with [C-11]FLB 457. This high affinity dopamine D-2-receptor antagonist provides a signal from a range of regions with a hundredfold difference in receptor density and should thus be suitable for evaluation of the wavelet approach. For cross-validation purposes the data were analysed with four methods: a traditional region-of-interest (ROI) based analysis, a pixel-based analysis and two variants of wavelet-aided analyses. In both variants the wavelet filter was spatially applied, but a two-dimensional filter was used in one case and a three-dimensional one in the other. The same linear-graphical binding potential (BP) estimation step was used for all methods and the results of the three parametric mapping techniques were compared to the reference ROI-based method by calculating the average BP of representative ROIs. The pixel-based and the two-dimensional-wavelet-based methods yielded highly correlated but systematically lower values when compared to the reference ROI-based method. The approach utilising three-dimensional wavelet filters yielded BP maps with regional averages closely matching the values of the ROI-based method. The results show that the combination of three-dimensional spatial wavelet filtering with established parameter estimation procedures provides detailed, accurate maps of radioligand binding parameters. Such maps can be used for in inter-individual or multi-condition comparisons of binding parameters at subregional levels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

The influence of a variety of parameters (e.g. reagents, solvents, temperature, and time) on the reaction outcome is discussed. Under the optimal reaction conditions, [C-11]1-isopropyl-4-phenylpiperazine ([C-11]iPPP) was synthesized from [2-C-11]acetone and 1-phenylpiperazine in a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 72%. The overall synthesis time, from EOB to HPLC analysis of [C-11]iPPP, was 20 min. Specific activity was 142-208 GBq/mumol at the end of synthesis. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Bearing an ester function, the available ligands are rapidly susceptible to hydrolysis which limits their use in vivo. In this study the synthesis of iodinated benzamide and ketone analogs were described. Their affinity for the 5-HT4R and their lipophilicity were evaluated and the most promising derivatives were evaluated ex vivo for their binding to the receptor and for their ability to displace the reference ligand [I-125]-SB207710.

The method afforded higher quality autoradiographs as well as an improvement in the tissue preservation when assayed in birds and chick embryos. The results confirmed the K-d values previously reported for membrane homogenate binding. The use of different radioligands to characterise beta-adrenoceptors, the higher B-max values found with autoradiography than those obtained by the membrane homogenate binding method and the typical errors in quantifying autoradiography are discussed. It is concluded that the method described here considerably improves autoradiographic P-adrenergic characterisation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The absolute configuration at C-11 of I was determined based on vicinal coupling constants and NOESY data. Docking experiments to the orthosteric binding site of the alpha 3 glycine receptor showed a binding mode of compound 2 analogous to that of strychnine, explaining its high antagonistic potency. The findings identify the C-11 amide function of strychnine as a suitable linker group for the future development of dimeric strychnine analogues targeting glycine receptors. The findings extend the SAR of strychnine at glycine receptors.	[Zlotos, Darius P.; Mohsen, Amal M.

The ligands synthesized were evaluated for affinity and selectivity by radioligand displacement and a functional steady-state GTPase assay. The results showed the nature of the spacer influences the biological readout. Albeit all compounds show significantly lower affinities than rimonabant, this fact could be used to demonstrate that affinities and selectivity are influenced by the chemical structure and length of the spacer and might be helpful for designing bivalent probes for other GPCR receptors.

Therefore, casticin, a lipophilic flavonoid and often the main compound in the 270 nm fingerprint chromatogram of a methanol extract, was selected as the relevant lead compound for quantitative analyses. An HPLC method was developed and validated to quantify the amount of casticin in eight commercial drug samples of Agni-casti fructus. A selective separation was achieved using a RP-C18-column with methanol-phosphate buffer-gradient as the mobile phase. The concentration of casticin in the samples varied from 0.025 to 0.212%. An additional minor peak was identified by LC-MS as penduletin.

Lu-177-DOTATOC is a patent-free radioligand, molecularly recognized by somatostatin receptors (SSTR-2) overexpressed in cancer cells of about 80% of patients with metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (GEP-NET). This translational research aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of Lu-177-iPSMA and Lu-177-DOTATOC developed as GMP pharmaceutical formulations for treating progressive and advanced mCRPC and NET. One hundred and forty-five patients with mCRPC and one hundred and eighty-seven subjects with progressive NET (83% GEP-NET and 17% other NET), treated with Lu-177-iPSMA and Lu-177-DOTATOC, respectively, were evaluated. Patients received a mean dose of 7.4 GBq per administration of Lu-177-iPSMA (range 1-5 administrations; 394 treatment doses) or Lu-177-DOTATOC (range 2-8 administrations; 511 treatment doses) at intervals of 1.5-2.5 months. Efficacy was assessed by SPECT/CT or PET/CT. Results were stratified by primary tumor origin and number of doses administered. Patients with mCRPC showed overall survival (OS) of 21.7 months with decreased radiotracer tumor uptake (SUV) and PSA level in 80% and 73% of patients, respectively. In addition, a significant reduction in pain (numerical scale from 10-7 to 3-1) was observed in 88% of patients with bone metastases between one and two weeks after the second injection. In the GEP-NET population, the median progression-free survival was 34.7 months, with an OS of >44.2 months. The treatments were well tolerated. Only ten patients experienced grade & GE; 3 myelosuppression (3% of all patients). The observed safety profiles and favorable therapeutic responses demonstrated the potential of Lu-177-iPSMA and Lu-177-DOTATOC to improve overall survival and quality of life in patients with progressive and advanced mCRPC and NET.

PDE7 is expressed by 2 genes which are both present in the brain. To date there is no radiotracer for PDE7 imaging described and detection of PDE7 has only been performed by ex vivo techniques. In this report we describe the radiosynthesis of a novel fluorine-18 labeled radiotracer for PDE7 as well as the in vivo evaluation in mice to verify whether it has potential for imaging of PDE7 in the brain. Methods: We have synthesized a potent fluorinated PDE7 inhibitor, [F-18]MICA-003 (PDE7 IC50 = 17 nM) and the corresponding tosylate precursor for radiolabeling. [F-18]MICA-003 was injected in C57BL/6 J mice (n = 5) and in vivo images were acquired by pPET imaging. Radiometabolite analysis in plasma and brain was performed to determine the stability of the radioligand. Results: [F-18]MICA-003 was synthesized by direct fluorination of the tosylate and produced in high decay corrected radiochemical yield (40%), high radiochemical purity (>98%) and high specific activity (86-497 GBq/pmol). pPET imaging revealed that [F-18]MICA-003 crosses the blood brain barrier and has a homogenous distribution over the brain which washes out after the initial peak uptake. [18F]MICA-003 was quickly metabolized in plasma with 8.9% 0.59% of intact [F-18]MICA-003 remaining at 5 min post injection. We observed the formation of three distinct radiometabolites of which the main radiometabolite was also detected in the brain in a proportion of 25.7 +/- 2.57% at this same time point. Conclusion: We have described the synthesis and in vivo evaluation of a novel radioligand for PDE7 imaging. Despite high uptake in the brain and favorable kinetics in vivo, the presence of a brain penetrant radiometabolite makes [F-18]MICA-003 unfavorable for the accurate quantification of PDE7 and more stable spiroquinazolinones analogs are in development.

Clones overexpressing SSTR2 were selected for radioligand-receptor binding assay and assessment of I-125-RC-160 internalization. The methylthiazolyl tetrazolium test was used to observe the lethal effect of I-131-RC-160, (NaI)-I-131, and RC-160 on hSSTR2-transfected A549 cells (A549-hSSTR2). Planar imaging was performed with a gamma camera equipped with pinhole collimator in nude mice bearing both A549-hSSTR2 tumors overexpressing SSTR2 and A549-pcDNA3 (pcDNA3-transfected A549 cells) tumors as control. Images were obtained at 0.5, 6, and 24 h after injection of 3.7 x 10(6) Bq Tc-99m-RC-160 via the tail vein. The inhibitory effects of I-131-RC-160, RC-160, and (NaI)-I-131 on the tumors were recorded by measuring the tumor volumes. At the end of the study, the tumors were excised and HE staining was performed. The binding radioactivity (sum of membrane-bound and internalized radioligand) of A549-hSSTR2 cells was 18.24 +/- 1.9 % of total counts added after 1 h of incubation, and was higher than that of A549-pcDNA3 cells 5.7 +/- 1.4 % (P < 0.05). The inhibition ratio of A549-hSSTR2 cells was 78.8 +/- 5.9 %. Clear images of tumor lesions in nude mice were achieved at 0.5 h post injection. In the A549-hSSTR2 xenograft tumor group, the growth of the tumors treated with I-131-RC-160 was significantly inhibited as compared to tumors in the group treated with RC-160 (P < 0.01). This study demonstrated that it was possible to introduce hsstr2 to non-expressing tumor cell lines and treat tumors with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs.

N-cyclohexyl-6-{[N-(2-methoxyethyl)-N-methylamino]methyl}-N-methylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole-2-carboxamide (YM-202074) exhibited high binding affinity for mGluR1 (K-i=4.8 nM), and selectivity over other mGluRs in vitro. The purpose of this study was to label YM-202074 with carbon-11 and to evaluate in vitro and in vivo characteristics of [C-11]YM-202074 as a PET ligand for mGluR1 in rodents. Methods: [C-11]YM-202074 was synthesized by N-[C-11]methylation of its desmethyl precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide. The in vitro and in vivo brain regional distributions were determined in rats using autoradiography and PET, respectively. Results: [C-11]YM-202074 (262-630 MBq, n=5) was obtained with radiochemical purity of >98% and specific activity of 27-52 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis, starting from [C-11]CO2 of 19.3-21.5 GBq. In vitro autoradiographic results showed that the high specific binding of [C-11]YM-202074 for mGluR1 was presented in the cerebellum, thalamus and hippocampus, which are known as mGluR1-rich regions. In ex vivo autoradiography and PET studies, the radioligand was specifically distributed in the cerebellum, although the uptake was low. Furthermore, the regional distribution was fairly uniform in the whole brain by pretreatment with JNJ16259685 (a mGluR1 antagonist). However, radiometabolite(s) was detected in the brain. Conclusions: From these results, especially considering the low brain uptake and the influx of radiometabolite(s) into brain, [C-11]YM-202074 may not be a useful PET ligand for in vivo imaging of mGluR1 in the brain.

This study focuses on the ibodutant pharmacodynamic profile at the human NK(2)R and compares it with two other antagonists, nepadutant (MEN11420, (cyclo-{[Asn(beta-D-GlcNAc)Asp-Trp-Phe-Dpr-Leu]cyclo(2 beta-5 beta)}) and saredutant [SR48968, (S)-N-methyl-N[4-(4-acetylamino-4-phenylpiperidino)2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)butyl]benzamide]. In functional experiments (phosphatidylinositol accumulation) in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human NK(2)R, ibodutant potency measured toward concentration-response curves to neurokinin A as pK(B) was 10.6, and its antagonism mechanism was surmountable and competitive. In the same assay, antagonism equilibration and reversibility experiments of receptor blockade indicated that ibodutant quickly attains equilibrium and that reverts from receptor compartment in a slower manner. Kinetic properties of ibodutant were assessed through competitive binding kinetics experiments performed at [(3)H]nepadutant and [(3)H]saredutant binding sites. Determined K on and K off values indicated a fast association and slow dissociation rate of ibodutant at the different antagonist binding sites. Last, by radioligand binding experiments at some mutated human tachykinin NK(2)Rs, the amino acidic determinants crucial for the high affinity of ibodutant were identified at the transmembrane (TM) level: Cys167 in TM4; Ile202 and Tyr206 in TM5; Phe270, Tyr266, and Trp263 in TM6; and Tyr289 in TM7. These results indicated an extended antagonist binding pocket in the TM portion of the receptor, which is conceived crucial for TM3 and 6 arrangement and leads to G protein-coupled receptor activation. By combining this information and molecular modeling, the docking mode of ibodutant-human NK(2)R complex is proposed.

The receptors were evaluated by the antagonist radioligand [H-3] 5-N-(4-methoxyphenyl-carbamoyl) amino-8-propyl-2(2furyl)-pyrazolo-[4,3e]-1,2,4-triazolo-[1,5-c]-pyrimidine ([H-3] MRE 3008F20), which yielded B-max values of 125+/-15 and 225+/-23 fmol/mg of protein and K-D values of 1.79+/-0.30 and 1.85+/-0.25 nM in R and A cells, respectively. The protein seems to be induced with remarkable rapidity starting at 15 min and reaches a plateau at 30 min. Western blot assays revealed that the up-regulation of the A(3) subtype after lymphocyte activation was caused by an increase in an enriched CD4(+) cell fraction. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments confirmed the rapid increase of A(3) mRNA after T cell activation. Competition of radioligand binding by adenosine ligands displayed a rank order of potency typical of the A(3) subtype. Thermodynamic data indicated that the binding is enthalpy- and entropy-driven in both R and A cells, suggesting that the activation process does not involve, at a molecular level, receptor alterations leading to modifications in the A(3)-related binding mechanisms. Functionally, the up-regulation of A(3) adenosine receptors in A versus R cells corresponded to a potency increase of the A(3) agonist N-6-(3-iodo-benzyl)-2-chloro-adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide in inhibiting cAMP accumulation (IC50=1.5+/-0.4 and 2.7+/-0.3 nM, respectively); this effect was antagonized by MRE 3008F20 (IC50=5.0+/-0.3 nM). In conclusion, our results provide, for the first time, an in-depth investigation of A(3) receptors in human lymphocytes and demonstrate that, under activating conditions, they are up-regulated and may contribute to the effects triggered by adenosine.

This method obviates the time-consuming [F-18]fluoride drying step routinely required in the preparation of most fluorine-18 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. The [F-18]fluoride ions eluted from a QMA (quaternary ammonium anion exchange) cartridge with phase transfer agents were directly mixed in various organic solvents for subsequent radiofluorination. Herein, we report the azeotropic drying-free radiofluorination of aliphatic substrates and demonstrate the viability of hydrated [F-18]fluoride ions in a mixed organic solvent system for obtaining useful radiochemical yields (RCYs). This practical and simple method has demonstrated general applicability to the production of established PET tracers as well as to the rapid assessment and chemical optimization of early-stage potential radiotracers.

Extensive evidence points to an important role of AdK in several diseases, and suggests that AdK inhibition might be a promising therapeutic strategy. The development of a new AdK assay and subsequent screening of part of our focused compound library led to the identification of 12 hit compounds (hit rate of 6%) representing six new classes of non-nucleoside human AdK inhibitors. The most potent inhibitor 1 displayed a K-i value of 184 nM. Compound screening with a newly developed assay was useful and efficient for discovering novel AdK inhibitors which may serve as lead structures for developing drugs for adenosine augmentation therapy.

These compounds share structural elements with the classical D2-like dopamine receptor antagonists haloperidol, N-methylspiperone and benperidol. Two new compounds, 4-(4-iodophenyl)-1-((4-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl) methyl) piperidin-4-ol (6) and 4-(4-iodophenyl)-1-((5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl) methyl) piperidin-4-ol (7), were found to have high affinity to and selectivity for D2 versus D3 receptors. Changing the aromatic ring system from an indole to other heteroaromatic ring systems reduced the D2 binding affinity and the D2 versus D3 selectivity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Materials and Methods: In vitro liver microsomal studies were performed to evaluate the degree of defluorination. Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) studies were then conducted for 2 h with or without an anti-defluorination agent. The regions of interest were the hippocampus and frontal cortex (5-HT1A target regions) and the cerebellum (5-HT1A nontarget region). The in vivo kinetics of the radioligands were compared based on the brain uptake values and target-to-nontarget ratio. We also performed a comparison of binding potential (BPND) as a steady-state binding parameter. Finally, binding affinities to 5-HT1A receptors were assessed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) cells expressing human recombinant 5-HT1A receptors. Results: The radiochemical yield of [F-18]Mefway was slightly higher than that of [F-18]FCWAY (19 vs. 15%). With regard to metabolic stability against defluorination, both compounds exhibited similar stability in rat liver microsomes, but [F-18]Mefway displayed higher stability in the human microsome (defluorination ratio at 30 min: 32 vs. 29 in rat liver microsomes, 31 vs. 64 in human liver microsomes for [F-18]Mefway and [F-18]FCWAY, respectively). There were no significant differences in brain uptake, the target-to-nontarget ratios, and the BPND (at hippocampus, peak brain uptakes: 6.9 vs. 8.5, target-to-nontarget ratios: 6.9 vs. 8.5, BPND: 5.2 vs. 6.2 for [F-18]Mefway and [F-18]FCWAY). The binding affinity of [F-18]Mefway was considerably higher than that of [F-18]FCWAY (IC50 : 1.5 nM vs. 2.2 nM). Conclusion: [F-18]Mefway exhibits favorable characteristics compared to [F-18]FCWAY in rodents, and may be a promising radioligand for use in human subjects. Synapse 68:595-603, 2014.

In the Ames test for mutagenicity, 2-F-A-85380 was without effect in five bacterial strains. No evidence of gross pathology or histopathological changes occurred in either 2- day acute (0.4 4000 nmol/kg i.v.) or 14-day expanded acute ( 40 - 4000 nmol/kg i. v.) toxicity studies in mice. Similarly, hematology and serum chemistry values in rhesus monkeys administered 60 nmol/kg i. v. were not affected over 14 days. Like nicotine, 2- F-A-85380 produced convulsions in mice at very high doses. The ED50 value of 2-F-A-85380 for eliciting tonic-clonic convulsions (5.0 mumol/kg i. v.) was nearly 4 times greater than that of nicotine (ED50 = 1.4 mumol/kg i. v.). Lower doses of 2-F-A-85380 ( 30 - 300 nmol/kg i.v.) and nicotine ( 20 - 400 nmol/kg i.v.) increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac contractility in rats. Notably, the PR, QRS, or QTc intervals of the rat electrocardiogram were unaffected by either drug. Dosimetry studies indicated that the urinary bladder wall was the critical organ and total radiation exposure was within acceptable limits. Estimated doses of 2-F-A-85380 required to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% ranged from 40 to 58 nmol/ kg i.v. Nevertheless, the estimated radiopharmaceutically relevant dose of [F-18] 2-F-A-8380 required for initial PET imaging studies, 10 pmol/kg, is less than 1/4000th of the doses calculated ( 40 - 58 nmol/ kg i.v.) to elevate blood pressure and heart rate by 10% in humans and should elicit no clinically significant effects and have acceptable dosimetry.

This approach minimises the a priori assumption and may thus serve as a gold standard to validate other simplified methods. Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) data were acquired in six healthy subjects during 60 min. Three different injection protocols were applied, each consisting of three injections with varying SAs: high specific activity (SA). low SA or unlabelled ligand only. Arterial blood samples were collected via a cannula in the radial artery. Time-activity data in myocardial tissue were obtained using regions of interest (ROIs) on short axis planes. All data were analysed with a two-tissue compartment, six-parameter (K-1, k(2), k(on), k(off), B-max, F-by) model that relies on explicit compartments for describing the kinetics of both labelled and unlabelled radioligand. Time-activity curves showed that unlabelled ligand could displace the radioligand from the receptor. This resulted in increased radioactivity levels in plasma. Modelling results yielded B-max values of 9.74 +/- 1.80 nM and a K-D of 0.58 +/- 0.22 nM, assuming a reaction volume of 0.15. In addition, parametric polar images of B-max could be calculated. The protocol with injections of high SA, low SA. and unlabelled ligand, respectively. was found to be the most sensitive to parameter changes. We conclude that with tracer kinetic modelling of (S)-[C-11]CGP 12388, the beta-adrenoceptor density in the human heart can accurately be obtained in vivo. This approach may thus serve as a gold standard.

For further optimisation of the previously automated one-pot radiosynthesis of [F-18]NS14490 using a tosylate precursor, precursors with other leaving groups (nosylate and mosylate) were synthesized and compared with the tosylate with respect to their reactivities towards [F-18]fluoride. The use of these different precursors resulted in comparable labelling yields of [F-18]NS14490. A novel mosylate precursor was synthesized and evaluated, which has revealed a higher stability during a storage period of five months compared to the corresponding tosylate and nosylate.

Nine out of twenty-one compounds were potent inhibitors of PDE10A with IC50 values ranging from 1.5 to 18.6 nM. Notably, the IC50 values of compounds 26a, 26b, and 33c were 1.52 +/- 0.18, 2.86 +/- 0.10, and 3.73 +/- 0.60 nM, respectively; these three compounds also showed high in vitro selectivity (> 1000-fold) for PDE10A over PDE 3A/3B, PDE4A/4B. The high potency and selectivity of these three compounds suggests that they could be radiolabeled with PET radionuclides for further evaluation of their in vivo pharmacological behavior and ability to quantify PDE10A in the brain.

SAR studies of this ion channel have shed light on the structural requirements for hERG interaction but most importantly may reveal drug design principles to reduce hERG affinity. In the present study, a novel library of neutral and positively charged heteroaromatic derivatives of the class III antiarrhythmic agent dofetilide was synthesized and assessed for hERG affinity in radioligand binding and manual patch clamp assays. Structural modifications of the pyridine moiety, side chain, and peripheral aromatic moieties were evaluated, thereby revealing approaches for reducing hERG binding affinity. In particular, we found that the extra rigidity imposed close to the positively charged pyridine moiety can be very efficient in decreasing hERG affinity.	[Carvalho, Joao F.

Effects of common anesthetic agents on [<SUP>18</SUP>F] flumazenil binding to the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Flumazenil; GABA(A) receptor; PET; Anesthesia; Ketamine; Isoflurane; Dexmedetomidine	AMINOBUTYRIC ACID(A) RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; C-11-FLUMAZENIL BINDING; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; PET; KETAMINE; BRAIN; MONKEY; MICRODIALYSIS	Background: The availability of GABAA receptor binding sites in the brain can be assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) using the radioligand, [F-18] flumazenil. However, the brain uptake and binding of this PET radioligand are influenced by anesthetic drugs, which are typically needed in preclinical imaging studies and clinical imaging studies involving patient populations that do not tolerate relatively longer scan times. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of anesthesia on the binding of [F-18] flumazenil to GABAA receptors in mice. Methods: Brain and whole blood radioactivity concentrations were measured ex vivo by scintillation counting or in vivo by PET in four groups of mice following administration of [F-18] flumazenil: awake mice and mice anesthetized with isoflurane, dexmedetomidine, or ketamine/dexmedetomidine. Dynamic PET recordings were obtained for 60 min in mice anesthetized by either isoflurane or ketamine/dexmedetomidine. Static PET recordings were obtained at 25 or 55 min after [F-18] flumazenil injection in awake or dexmedetomidine-treated mice acutely anesthetized with isoflurane. The apparent distribution volume (V-T*) was calculated for the hippocampus and frontal cortex from either the full dynamic PET scans using an image-derived input function or from a series of ex vivo experiments using whole blood as the input function. Results: PET images showed persistence of high [F-18] flumazenil uptake (up to 20 % ID/g) in the brains of mice scanned under isoflurane or ketamine/dexmedetomidine anesthesia, whereas uptake was almost indiscernible in late samples or static scans from awake or dexmedetomidine-treated animals. The steady-state VT* was twofold higher in hippocampus of isoflurane-treated mice and dexmedetomidine-treated mice than in awake mice. Conclusions: Anesthesia has pronounced effects on the binding and blood-brain distribution of [F-18] flumazenil. Consequently, considerable caution must be exercised in the interpretation of preclinical and clinical PET studies of GABAA receptors involving the use of anesthesia.

We report the synthesis of enantiopure benzovesamicol derivatives: (R,R) or (S,S)-(E)-2-hydroxy-5-(3-iodoprop-2-en-1-oxy)-3-(4-phenylpiperidino)tetralin [(R,R)-AOIBV: K-d=0.45 nM or (S,S)-5-AOIBV: K-d=4.3 nM] and their corresponding tributyltin precursors for radioiodination. (R,R or S,S)-5-AOIBV was labeled with iodine-125 from their corresponding n-tributyltin precursors. Both compounds were obtained with radiochemical and optical purity greater than 97% and in radiochemical yields ranging 34-36%. To determine if these compounds could provide an advantage when compared to [I-125]-iodo benzovesamicol (IBVM), IBVM was also labeled and used as the reference compound in all ex vivo experiments. Ex vivo biodistribution experiments in rats revealed that [I-125] -(R,R)-5-AOIBV displayed the most suitable pharmacological profile as the radioactivity distribution corresponded well with the known VAChT brain density. Moreover, pre-injection of vesamicol prevented the uptake of [I-125]-(R,R)-5-AOIBV in striaturn, cortex and hippocampus, demonstrating selectivity for the VAChT. However, even if time activity curves of [I-125]-(R,R)-5-AOIBV confirmed that this compound could be used to visualize the VAChT in vivo, at each point of the kinetic study, [I-125]-(R,R)-5-AOIBV showed a lower specific binding compared to [I-125]-IBVM. These results made [I-125]-( R,R)-5-AOIBV inferior to [I-125]-IBVM for the VAChT exploration in vivo. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Scatchard analysis of specific saturation binding suggested a single binding site, with K-d of 122 +/- 26.1 nM and a corresponding B-max of 180 +/- 6 f mol in 3.0 x 10(5) cells. 3 The relative binding affinities of a series of modified PAR2 agonist peptides obtained from competition studies paralleled their relative EC50 values for Ca2+ mobilisation assays, indicating improved binding affinities by substitution with 2-furoyl at the N-terminus serine. 4 Pretreatment of cells with trypsin reduced specific binding of [H-3] 2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH2, demonstrating direct competition between the synthetic agonist peptide and the proteolytically revealed tethered ligand for the binding site of the receptor. 5 In HCT-15 cells endogenously expressing PAR2, the binding of [H-3] 2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH2 was displaced by addition of unlabeled ligands, Ser-Leu-Ile-Gly-Lys-Val (SLIGKV-OH) or 2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH2. The relative binding affinity of 2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH2 to SLIGKV-OH was comparable to its relative EC50 value for Ca2+ mobilisation assays. 6 The binding assay was successfully performed in monolayers of PAR2 expressing NCTC2544 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( HUVEC), in 96- and 24- well plate formats, respectively. 7 These studies indicate that [H-3] 2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH2 binds to human PAR2 at its ligand- binding site. The use of this radioligand will be valuable for characterising chemicals that interact to PAR2.

Pharmacological evaluation includes radioligand binding assays with [H-3]-CP55940 for CB1 and CB2 receptors and functional activity for cannabinoid receptors on isolated tissue. In addition, functional activity of the two synthetic cannabinoids antagonists 18 (PGN36) and 17 (PGN38) were carried out in the osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 that is able to express CB2R upon osteogenic conditions. Both antagonists abolished the increase in collagen type I gene expression by the well-known inducer of bone activity, the HU308 agonist. The results of pharmacological tests have revealed that four of these derivatives behave as CB2R cannabinoid antagonists. In particular, the compounds 17 (PGN38) and 18 (PGN36) highlight as promising candidates as pharmacological tools.

We prepared a set of novel ligands for D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors by combining two indolo[2,3-a]quinolizidine scaffolds with various tripeptide moieties. The binding and functional properties of these molecules were determined by radioligand binding studies in brain striatum membranes and by intracellular cAMP production assays in cells expressing different dopamine receptor subtypes. Some indoloquinolizidine-peptide hybrids, mainly with the trans configuration, showed dual agonist activity at both D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors and may therefore be useful for testing the therapeutic potential of multivalent drugs on these targets.

In order to allow a rapid and accurate determination of the quality in the clinical routine the aim of this study was to evaluate different methods of radiochemical purity (RCP) testing. Three different methods of RCP testing were compared: high-performance liquid chromatograhpy (HPLC), thin layer chromatography (TLC) and minicolumn (Sep-Pak purification = SPE). HPLC was shown to be the most effective method for the quality control. The use of TLC and SPE is only recommended after sufficient practical labelling experience. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Through the use of comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) we have generated a training model that includes 78 structurally diverse A(2A) agonists and correlated their affinity for isolated rat brain receptors with differences in their structural and electrostatic properties. We validated this model by predicting the activity of a test set that included 24 additional A(2A) agonists. Our CoMFA model, which incorporates the physiochemical property of dipole and selects against A(1) receptor activity, generated a correlated final model (r(2) = 0.891) that provides for enhanced A(2A) selectivity and predictability. Synthesis, pharmacological evaluation, and modeling of four novel ligands further validate the utility and predictive power (r(2) = 0.626) of the CoMFA model.

Two new peptides, MS05 and MS09, were synthesized and found to bind with sub-nanomolar affinities to the MC1 receptor. Both these peptides showed strong agonistic activity at the MC, receptor. The MS05 was the most MC1 receptor selective as it showed virtually no binding affinity for the MC4 and MC5 receptors and only micromolar affinity for the MC3 receptor. The selectivity and potency of the new peptides make them potent tools For studies of MC1 receptors, as well as novel potential candidate drugs for the treatment of inflammatory conditions.

We tested the claim that both striatal and extrastriatal dopamine D-2/3 receptor availabilities vary with age in vivo in humans by determining the values of BPND of the specific radioligand [C-11]raclopride. We determined values of BPND in striatal and extrastriatal volumes-of-interest (VOI) with the same specific receptor radioligand. We estimated values of BPND in individual voxels of brains of healthy volunteers in vivo, and we obtained regional averages of VOI by dynamic positron emission tomography (PET). We calculated average values of BPND in caudate nucleus and putamen of striatum, and in frontal, occipital, parietal, and temporal cortices of the forebrain, by means of four methods, including the ERLiBiRD (Estimation of Reversible Ligand Binding and Receptor Density) method, the tissue reference methods of Logan and Logan-Ichise, respectively, and the SRTM (Simplified Reference Tissue Method). Voxelwise generation of parametric maps of values of BPND used the multi-linear regression version of SRTM. Age-dependent changes of the binding potential presented with an inverted U-shape with peak binding potentials reached between the ages of 20 and 30. The estimates of BPND declined significantly with age after the peak in both striatal and extrastriatal regions, as determined by all four methods, with the greatest decline observed in posterior (occipital and parietal) cortices (14% per decade) and the lowest decline in caudate nucleus (3% per decade). The sites of the greatest declines are of particular interest because of the clinical implications.

We studied a key step, the ability of (-)-cocaine to occupy sigma(1) receptors in vivo, using CD-1 (R) mice and the novel radioligand [I-125]E-N-1-(3-iodoallyl)-N-4-(3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl)-piperazine ([I-125]E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE). (-)-Cocaine displayed an ED50 of 68 mol/kg for inhibition of specific radioligand binding in whole brain, with values between 73 and 80 mol/kg for heart, lung, and spleen. For comparison, an ED50 of 26 mol/kg for (-)-cocaine occupancy of striatal dopamine transporters (DAT) was determined by inhibition of [I-125]3-(4-iodophenyl)tropan-2-carboxylic acid isopropyl ester ([I-125]RTI-121) binding. A chief finding is the relatively small potency difference between (-)-cocaine occupancy of sigma(1) receptors and the DAT, although the DAT occupancy is likely underestimated. Interactions of (-)-cocaine with sigma(1) receptors were assessed further using [I-125]E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE for regional cerebral biodistribution studies and quantitative ex vivo autoradiography of brain sections. (-)-Cocaine binding to cerebral sigma(1) receptors proved directly proportional to the relative site densities known for the brain regions. Nonradioactive E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE gave an ED50 of 0.23 mol/kg for occupancy of cerebral sigma(1) receptors, and a 3.16 mol/kg (i.p.) dose attenuated (-)-cocaine-induced locomotor hyperactivity by 30%. This effect did not reach statistical significance, but suggests that E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE is a probable sigma(1) receptor antagonist. As groundwork for the in vivo studies, we used standard techniques in vitro to determine ligand affinities, site densities, and pharmacological profiles for the sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors expressed in CD-1 (R) mouse brain.

Our laboratory developed N-benzyl-N-methyl-2[7,8-dihydro-7-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)-8-oxo-2-phenyl-9H-purin-9-yl]acetamide ([F-18]FEDAC) as a TSPO positron emission tomography (PET) ligand. Here, using small-animal PET with [F-18]FEDAC, we performed TSPO imaging and quantitative analysis of TSPO binding in rat peripheral tissues. Methods: The in vivo distribution and kinetics of [F-18]FEDAC were measured in rat peripheral tissues (heart, lung and kidney). Using the in vivo pseudo-equilibrium method, TSPO binding parameters [TSPO density (B-max), dissociation constant (K-D)] and receptor occupancy were estimated in these peripheral tissues. Results: [F-18]FEDAC was highly distributed in the lung, heart and kidney, and these TSPO-enriched tissues could be clearly visualized. The kinetics of this radioligand in these tissues was rapid, which is suitable for the determination of in vivo TSPO binding parameters and receptor occupancy. The B-max value of TSPO in the heart, lung, and kidney was 393, 141, and 158 pmol/ml, respectively. The K-D value of the radioligand in the heart, lung, and kidney was 119, 36 and 123 nM, respectively. By pretreatment with 5 mg/kg Ro 5-4864 (a TSPO ligand), about 90% of binding sites for TSPO in the heart and lung were occupied. In the kidney, the binding sites were completely occupied by 5 mg/kg Ro 5-4864. Conclusions: [F-18]FEDAC is a suitable PET ligand for TSPO imaging and quantitative analysis of TSPO binding in rat peripheral tissues. The utilization of [F-18]FEDAC-PET and the pseudo-equilibrium method can contribute to the study of the TSPO function and evaluate the in vivo binding parameters and receptor occupancy of TSPO therapeutic compounds.

Main methods: The tissue segment binding method with a hydrophilic radioligand (-)-4-[3-t-butylamino-2-hydroxypropoxy]-[5,7-H-3]benzimidazol-2-one ([H-3]-CGP12177) was employed. Key findings: Specific and saturable binding of [H-3]-CGP12177 to intact tissue segments was detected by using (+/-)-propranolol to define nonspecific binding, showing a single population of plasma membrane binding sites with high affinity. Competition experiments with selective beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists revealed a single population of beta(2)-adrenoceptors in ocular tissues and of beta(1)-adrenoceptors in atria, but mixed populations of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors in 70% and 30%, respectively, in lung. A competition curve for timolol was biphasic in lung and its binding affinity for beta(2)-adrenoceptors was approximately 158-fold higher than for beta(1)-adrenoceptors, indicating the beta(2)-selectivity of timolol. In contrast, competition curves for stereoisomers of befunolol, carteolol, and propranolol were monophasic in all tissues. The (-)-enantiomers of these antagonists were more potent than corresponding (+)-enantiomers in displacing from [H-3]-CGP12177 binding, and the isomeric potency ratios of befunolol and carteolol were less than those of propranolol. Significance: This study with tissue segment binding method suggests that the binding affinity of(-)-enantiomers of beta-adrenoceptor antagonists for plasma membrane beta-adrenoceptors (beta(1)-adrenoceptors of atria, beta(2)-adrenoceptors of ocular tissues, and mixed beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptors of lung) is higher than that of corresponding (+)-enantiomers and their stereoselectivity is different between beta-adrenoceptor antagonists.

We have prepared a [H-3]-labelled truncated N/OFQ peptide, [H-3]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 and compared its binding characteristics with [H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH and [I-125](YN)-N-14/OFQ(1-17)OH in membranes prepared from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the recombinant human NOP (CHOhNOP) and the rat cerebrocortex. [H-3]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2, [H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH and [I-125](YN)-N-14/OFQ(1-17)OH binding to CHOhNOP was concentration dependent and saturable with receptor density (B-max) and radioligand equilibrium dissociation constant (pK(d)) values (mean +/- SEM) of 1043 +/- 58 fmol/mg protein and 10.35 +/- 0.03, 1348 +/- 44 fmol/mg protein and 10.06 +/- 0.04, and 1169 +/- 76 fmol/mg protein and 10.45 +/- 0.06, respectively. In the rat, B-max and pK(d) values for [H-3]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 and [H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH were 130 +/- 1 fmol/mg protein and 10.70 +/- 0.03, and 157 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein and 10.34 +/- 0.02, respectively. The binding of all radioligands was displaced by a range of peptide and non-peptide ligands. There was a strong correlation (r(2) = 0.92, P = 0.002) between pK(i) values estimated with [H-3]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 and [H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH. No such correlation was observed in comparison with the [I-125]-labelled peptide (poor agreement with low affinity N/OFQ(1-9)NH2, Dynorphin-A and Naloxone benzoylhydrazone). We suggest that [H-3]N/OFQ(1-13)NH2 may be a useful alternative to [H-3]N/OFQ(1-17)OH. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

(S)-3-(Carboxyformamido)-2-(3-(carboxymethyl)ureido)propanoic acids proved to be potent PSMA ligands with K-i values ranging from 0.08 nM to 8.98 nM, which are in the range of or are higher in potency compared to previously published urea-based ligands. Computational docking was performed to study the binding mode of the two most potent ligands discovered. FITC-conjugated L14 could selectively stain PSMA(+) LNCaP cells over PSMA(-) PC3 cells. IRDye800CW conjugated L16 can effectively image tumors in a murine xenograft model of prostate cancer.

Reported toxicities include myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, the latter manifesting as decreased kidney function, often developing months to years after treatment completion. We present a case of PRRT-induced kidney toxicity manifesting as a severe Gitelman-like tubulopathy with preserved kidney function. Because profound hypokalemia and hypocalcemia can lead to life-threatening arrhythmias, we highlight the necessity for careful monitoring of serum and urine electrolytes in patients receiving PRRT.

Enabled by simultaneous positron emission tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET-MRI), we determined whether neuromodulatory effects of dopamine scale to the level of cortical networks and coordinate their interplay during working memory. Among network territories, mean cortical D-1 receptor densities differed substantially but were strongly interrelated, suggesting cross-network regulation. Indeed, mean cortical D-1 density predicted working memory-emergent decoupling of the frontoparietal and default networks, which respectively manage task-related and internal stimuli. In contrast, striatal D-1 predicted opposing effects within these two networks but no between-network effects. These findings specifically link cortical dopamine signaling to network crosstalk that redirects cognitive resources to working memory, echoing neuromodulatory effects of D-1 signaling on the level of cortical microcircuits.

A series of novel compounds in the group of 4-methylpiperazine-1,3,5-triazine-2-amines were designed and obtained. Considered structures were modified at the triazine 6-position by introduction of variously substituted arylethenyl moieties. Their affinities to histamine H-4 receptors were evaluated in radioligand binding assays with use of Sf9 cells, transiently expressing human H4R.

They show a very diverse range of kinetic profiles (from 1 min (compound 52) to 1 h (compound 43)), and their structure-affinity relationships (SAR) and structure-kinetics relationships (SKR) were established. When put in perspective with the increasing importance of binding kinetics in drug discovery, these results bring new evidence of the consequences of affinity-only driven selection of drug candidates, that is, the potential elimination of slightly less active compounds that may display preferable binding kinetics.

In this study, we aimed to prove the concept of pretherapeutic prediction of dosimetry based on imaging and laboratory measurements before the RLT treatment. Methods Twenty-three patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) treated with Lu-177-PSMA I&T RLT were included retrospectively. They had available pre-therapy Ga-68-PSMA-HEBD-CC PET/CT and at least 3 planar and 1 SPECT/CT imaging for dosimetry. Overall, 43 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA I&T RLT were applied. Organ-based standard uptake values (SUVs) were obtained from pre-therapy PET/CT scans. Patient dosimetry was calculated for the kidney, liver, spleen, and salivary glands using Hermes Hybrid Dosimetry 4.0 from the planar and SPECT/CT images. Machine learning methods were explored for dose prediction from organ SUVs and laboratory measurements. The uncertainty of these dose predictions was compared with the population-based dosimetry estimates. Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was used to assess the prediction uncertainty of estimated dosimetry. Results An optimal machine learning method achieved a dosimetry prediction MAPE of 15.8 +/- 13.2% for the kidney, 29.6% +/- 13.7% for the liver, 23.8% +/- 13.1% for the salivary glands, and 32.1 +/- 31.4% for the spleen. In contrast, the prediction based on literature population mean has significantly larger MAPE (p < 0.01), 25.5 +/- 17.3% for the kidney, 139.1% +/- 111.5% for the liver, 67.0 +/- 58.3% for the salivary glands, and 54.1 +/- 215.3% for the spleen. Conclusion The preliminary results confirmed the feasibility of pretherapeutic estimation of treatment dosimetry and its added value to empirical population-based estimation. The exploration of dose prediction may support the implementation of treatment planning for RLT.

Characterization of cannabinoid receptors expressed in Ewing sarcoma TC-71 and A-673 cells as potential targets for anti-cancer drug development	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						Cannabidiol; Cannabinoid receptors; Cell viability; Cytotoxicity; Ewing sarcoma; WIN-55,212-2	ALKYLINDOLE-SENSITIVE RECEPTORS; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; CB2 RECEPTOR; AGONIST; CANCER; PHARMACOLOGY; GPR55; GENE; INVOLVEMENT; INHIBITION	Aims: Characterizing cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) expressed in Ewing sarcoma (EWS) cell lines as potential targets for anti-cancer drug development. Main methods: CBR affinity and function were examined by competitive binding and G-protein activation, respectively. Cannabinoid-mediated cytotoxicity and cell viability were evaluated by LDH, and trypan blue assays, respectively. Key findings: qRT-PCR detected CB1 (CB1R) and CB2 receptor (CB2R) mRNA in TC-71 cells. However, binding screens revealed that CBRs expressed exhibit atypical properties relative to canonical receptors, because specific binding in TC-71 could only be demonstrated by the established non-selective CB1/CB2R radioligand [H-3]WIN-55,212-2, but not CB1/CB2R radioligand [H-3]CP-55,940. Homologous receptor binding demonstrated that [H-3] WIN-55,212-2 binds to a single site with nanomolar affinity, expressed at high density. Further support for non-canonical CBRs expression is provided by subsequent binding screens, revealing that only 9 out of 28 well-characterized cannabinoids with high affinity for canonical CB1 and/or CB2Rs were able to displace [H-3] WIN-55,212-2, whereas two ligands enhanced [H-3]WIN-55,212-2 binding. Five cannabinoids producing the greatest [H-3]WIN-55,212-2 displacement exhibited high nanomolar affinity (K-i) for expressed receptors. G-protein modulation and adenylyl cyclase assays further indicate that these CBRs exhibit distinct signaling/functional profiles compared to canonical CBRs. Importantly, cannabinoids with the highest affinity for non-canonical CBRs reduced TC-71 viability and induced cytotoxicity in a time-dependent manner. Studies in a second EWS cell line (A-673) showed similar atypical binding properties of expressed CBRs, and cannabinoid treatment produced cytotoxicity. Significance: Cannabinoids induce cytotoxicity in EWS cell lines via non-canonical CBRs, which might be a potential therapeutic target to treat EWS.

Radiosynthesis and in vivo evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MP-10 as a positron emission tomography radioligand for phosphodiesterase 10A	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PET; PDE10A; MP-10; Carbon-11; In vivo; Brain	THERAPEUTIC APPROACH; INHIBITORS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PDE10A; BRAIN	Introduction: The aim of this study was to evaluate a newly reported positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]MP-10, a potent and selective inhibitor of the central phosphodiesterase 10A enzyme (PDE10A) in vivo, using PET. Methods: A procedure was developed for labeling MP-10 with carbon-11. [C-11]MP-10 was evaluated in vivo both in the pig and baboon brain. Results: Alkylation of the corresponding desmethyl compound with [C-11]methyl iodide produced [C-11]MP-10 with good radiochemical yield and specific activity. PET studies in the pig showed that [C-11]MP-10 rapidly entered the brain reaching peak tissue concentration at 1-2 min postadministration, followed by washout from the tissue. Administration of a selective PDE10A inhibitor reduced the binding in all brain regions to the levels of the cerebellum, demonstrating the saturability and selectivity of [C-11]MP-10 binding. In the nonhuman primate, the brain tissue kinetics of [C-11]MP-10 were slower, reaching peak tissue concentrations at 30-60 min postadministration. In both species, the observed rank order of regional brain signal was striatum>diencephalon>cortical regions=cerebellum, consistent with the known distribution and concentration of PDE10A. [IIMP-10 brain kinetics were well described by a two-tissue compartment model, and estimates of total volume of distribution (V-T) were obtained. Blocking studies with unlabeled MP-10 revealed the suitability of the cerebellum as a reference tissue and enabled the estimation of regional binding potential (BPND) as the outcome measure of specific binding. Quantification of [C-11]MP-10 binding using the simplified reference tissue model with cerebellar input function produced BPND estimates consistent with those obtained by the two-tissue compartment model. Conclusion: We demonstrated that [C-11]MP-10 possesses good characteristics for the in vivo quantification of the PDE10A in the brain by PET. (C)2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The main objective of this study was to determine if D2 receptor occupancy (RO) could be differentiated with agonist and antagonist radioligands in vivo. Agonist radioligands [H-3]-MNPA and [H-3]-(+)-PHNO were synthesized and compared to antagonist [H-3]-raclopride in the in vitro binding and in vivo occupancy studies. In vivo, unanesthetized rats were pretreated with quinpirole (full agonist), aripiprazole (partial agonist), or haloperidol (antagonist) prior to administration of the agonist or antagonist radioligand All three pretreatment compounds showed equivalent dose-dependent D2 receptor occupancy in the rat striatum with each radioligand. The in vivo receptor occupancy results suggested that the binding of quinpirole, aripiprazole, and haloperidol to the high or low affinity state of the D2 receptor could not be differentiated using radiolabeled agonists or antagonists, presumably due to a predominance of high affinity states of the D2 receptor in vivo. This hypothesis was supported in part by the in vitro binding results. Our in vitro results show that [H-3]-MNPA binds to D2S transfected CHO cell membranes at a single high affinity site. Displacement of [H-3]-(+)-PHNO binding by quinpirole and elimination of most [H-3]-(+)-PHNO binding by the guanine nucleotide GppNHp in striatal membranes suggest that the majority of D2 in striatal tissue is G-protein coupled. Together, these findings suggest that D2 agonist radioligands produce in vivo receptor occupancy comparable to [H-3]-raclopride Synapse 64:624-633, 2010.

Initial studies revealed that two novel benzimidazole allosteric modulators, 17-beta-hydroxy-17-beta-ethynyl-delta(4)-androstano[3,2-b]pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazole(WIN 62,577) and 17-beta-hydroxy-17-beta-ethynyl-5-beta-androstano[3,2-b]pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazole(WIN 51,708), exhibited different degrees of positive, negative, or close-to-neutral cooperativity with the orthosteric site on M-1 or M-4 mAChRs, depending on the chemical nature of the orthosteric radioligand that was used [[H-3] N-methylscopolamine ([H-3] NMS) versus [H-3] quinuclidinylbenzilate ([H-3]QNB)]. The largest window for observing an effect (negative cooperativity) was noted for the combination of WIN 62,577 and [H-3] QNB at the M 4 mAChR. Experiments involving the combination of these two ligands with unlabeled agonists [acetylcholine, 4-(m-chlorophenylcarbamoyloxy)2- butynyltrimethylammonium (McN-A-343), or xanomeline] revealed low degrees of negative cooperativity between WIN 62,577 and each agonist, whereas stronger negative cooperativity was observed against atropine. It is interesting that when these experiments were repeated using the prototypical modulators heptane-1,7-bis-(dimethyl-3 beta-phthalimidopropyl)ammonium bromide (C-7/3-phth), alcuronium, or brucine ( which act at a separate allosteric site), WIN 62,577 exhibited negative cooperativity with each modulator when the orthosteric site was unoccupied, but this switched to neutral cooperativity when the receptor was occupied by [H-3] QNB. Dissociation kinetic experiments using [H-3] NMS and combination of C-7/3-phth with WIN 62,577 also provided evidence for neutral cooperativity between the two allosteric sites when the orthosteric site is occupied. Together, these results provide insight into the nature of the interaction between two distinct allosteric sites on the M-4 mAChR and how this interaction is perturbed upon occupancy of the orthosteric site.

Radiation Dosimetry of a Novel Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> Receptor Radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Preladenant Based on PET/CT Imaging and Ex Vivo Biodistribution in Rats	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Radiation dosimetry; [C-11]preladenant; Small-animal PET/CT; Adenosine A(2A) receptor; Rat	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INFLAMMATION	[C-11]Preladenant was developed as a novel adenosine A(2A) receptor PET radioligand. The aim of this study was to determine the radiation dosimetry of [C-11]preladenant and to investigate whether dosimetry estimation based on organ harvesting can be replaced by positron emission tomography (PET)/x-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging in rats. Male Wistar rats (n = 35) were i.v. injected with [C-11]preladenant. The tracer biodistribution was determined by organ harvesting at 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min post injection. Hollow organs including the stomach, intestines, and urinary bladder were harvested with contents. In 10 rats, a 90-min dynamic PET/CT scan of the torso was acquired. Twenty volumes of interest (VOIs) were manually drawn on the PET image using the CT image of the same animal as anatomical reference. The dynamic time-activity curves were used to calculate organ residence times (RTs). Human radiation dosimetry estimates, derived from rat data, were calculated with OLINDA/EXM 1.1. PET-imaging and organ-harvesting estimated comparable organ RTs, with differences of 6-27 %, except for the lungs, pancreas, and urinary bladder, with differences of 48, 53, and 60, respectively. The critical organ was the small intestine with a dose of 25 mu Sv/MBq. The effective doses (EDs) calculated from imaging-based and organ-harvesting-derived data were 5.5 and 5.6 mu Sv/MBq, respectively, using the International Commission on Radiological Protection 60 tissue weighting factors. The ED of [C-11]preladenant (2 mSv for a 370-MBq injected dose) is comparable with other C-11-labeled PET tracers. Estimation of the radiation dosimetry of [C-11]preladenant by PET/CT imaging in rats is feasible and gives comparable results to organ harvesting, provided that small VOIs are used and the content of hollow organs is taken into account. Dosimetry by PET imaging can strongly reduce the number of laboratory animals required.	[Zhou, Xiaoyun; Elsinga, Philip H.; Khanapur, Shivashankar; Dierckx, Rudi A. J. O.; de Vries, Erik F.

What We Observe In Vivo Is Not Always What We See In Vitro: Development and Validation of <SUP>11</SUP>C-JNJ-42491293, A Novel Radioligand for mGluR2	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; mGluR2; positive allosteric modulator; specificity; knockout models	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PET TRACER; TYPE-2; MOUSE	Positive allosteric modulator's (PAM) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGluR2) are a potential therapy for anxiety, schizophrenia, and addiction. Aside from pathophysiologic imaging studies, an mGluR2 PET tracer would enable confirmation of sufficient central target engagement and assist dose selection for proof-of-concept studies of PAM compounds. C-11-JNJ-42491293, a novel high-affinity radioligand (human 50% inhibitory concentration = 9.6 nM) for the PAM site of mGluR2, was evaluated as a selective mGluR2 PAM PET tracer. Methods: In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography binding experiments in Wistar and in mGluR2 knockout and wildtype rats as well as in vivo biodistribution and brain PET imaging studies in wildtype and mGluR2 knockout rats in a primate and in humans were performed. Results: In vitro binding studies and in vivo imaging studies in Wistar rats showed moderate brain uptake, with a distribution pattern fully consistent with the reported intracerebral distribution of mGluR2. Given these promising findings, biodistribution, dosimetry, and brain kinetic modeling of C-11-JNJ-42491293 were determined in humans. Because of an unexpected high myocardial retention, additional C-11-JNJ-42491293 imaging studies were performed in recently available mGluR2 knockout and wildtype rats and in a monkey using a structurally distinct mGluR2 PAM ligand with affinity for the same site, demonstrating off-target binding in vivo that could not have been anticipated from previous in vitro experiments. To date, the target of this non-mGluR2 tracer binding remains unknown. Conclusion: On the basis of in vivo selectivity issues suggested by human distribution and demonstrated in knockout rat models, C-11-JNJ-42491293 was considered unsuitable as a specific PET ligand for in vivo imaging of mGluR2. These results emphasize the importance of elaborated in vitro/in vivo comparative studies and, when available, validation with knockout animal models or structurally distinct ligands with affinity for the same site, in radiotracer development.

Ginger and its pungent constituents non-competitively inhibit activation of human recombinant and native 5-HT3 receptors of enteric neurons	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						5-HT3 receptor; Ca2+influx; ligand-gated ion channel; radioligand binding; submucous plexus	GUINEA-PIG ILEUM; HUMAN SUBMUCOUS PLEXUS; ZINGIBER-OFFICINALE; SUBUNITS 5-HT3C; EXCITES NEURONS; EXPRESSION; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE; PHARMACOKINETICS; CHEMOTHERAPY; CONTRACTION	Background Beneficial effects of ginger in the treatment of gastrointestinal (GI) problems and chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting are well accepted. In rodents, the action of ginger seems to be mediated by the inhibition of 5-HT3 receptors, which are established targets to combat emesis and irritable bowel syndrome. Methods Heterologously expressed human 5-HT3A or 5-HT3AB receptors were characterized by means of Ca2+influx studies using HEK293 cells. Complementing Ca2+ measurements in Fluo-4-AM-stained whole-mount preparations of the human submucous plexus were carried out. Furthermore, [3H]GR65630 binding assays were performed to reveal the mode of action of ginger and its pungent compounds. Key Results We show for the first time that ginger extracts and its pungent arylalkane constituents concentration-dependently inhibit activation of human 5-HT3 receptors. Ginger extracts inhibited both receptors with increasing content of pungent compounds, confirming that these are part of ginger's active principle. Inhibition potencies of the arylalkanes 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol on both receptors were in the low micromolar range. A lipophilic ginger extract and 6-gingerol had no influence on 5-HT potency, but reduced the 5-HT maximum effect, indicating non-competitive inhibition. The non-competitive action was confirmed by [3H]GR65630 binding, showing that the ginger extract did not displace the radioligand from 5-HT3A and 5-HT3AB receptors. The potential relevance of the inhibitory action of ginger on native 5-HT3 receptors in the gut was confirmed in whole-mount preparations of the human submucous plexus. While a general neurotoxic effect of 6-gingerol was ruled out, it inhibited the 2-methyl-5-HT-mediated activation of 5-HT3 receptors residing on enteric neurons. Conclusions & Inferences Our findings may encourage the use of ginger extracts to alleviate nausea in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and to treat functional GI disorders.

Platelet binding and biodistribution of [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]rBitistatin in animal species and humans	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Workshop on After Bench to Bedside - Impact on Clinical Outcome	2007	La Jolla, CA			[Tc-99m]rBitistatin; Thrombus imaging; Platelets; alpha IIb beta(3) integrin; GPIIb/IIIa receptor	DEEP VENOUS THROMBOSIS; CONTRAST VENOGRAPHY; PEPTIDE; RECEPTOR; DISINTEGRINS; AGGREGATION; ACQUISITION; ANTAGONISTS; BITISTATIN; COMPLEX	Introduction: 99(m)Tc recombinant bitistatin (rBitistatin) is a radioligand for beta(11b)beta(3) (glycoproteins IIb/IIIa) receptor on platelets and is being developed as a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical for in vivo imaging of acute thrombi and emboli. Prior to the first administration of [99(m)Tc] rBitistatin to human subjects, its biodistribution and effects on platelets were evaluated in animals. This paper reports findings in animal studies in comparison with initial findings in normal human subjects. Methods: [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin was administered to mice, guinea pigs and dogs to assess time-dependent organ distribution, urinary excretion and blood disappearance rates. Blood samples were analyzed to determine radioligand binding to circulating platelets and the extent of plasma protein binding. The effect of [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin on circulating platelet count was determined. These factors were also determined in normal human subjects who received [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin as part of a Phase I clinical trial. Results: The main organs that accumulated [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin were kidneys, liver and spleen in all animal species and humans. The main organs seen on human images were the kidneys and spleen. Liver uptake was fainter, and soft-tissue background was low. [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin bound to circulating platelets in blood, with a higher percentage of binding to platelets in guinea pigs and dogs compared to that in humans. Plasma protein binding was low and of little consequence in view of platelet binding. The main route of excretion was through the urine. [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin did not affect platelet counts in humans or dogs. Conclusions: [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin, when administered at low doses for imaging, has no adverse effects on platelets and has the qualitative biodistribution predicted by animal studies. [99(m)Tc]rBitistatin was found to bind to circulating platelets in humans, suggesting that it will be able to bind to activated platelets in vivo in patients with acute thrombi.

High and low affinity binding sites for PGD(2) were identified in the CRTH2 receptor population by saturation analysis with respective equilibrium dissociation constants (K-D) of 2.5 and 109 nm. This revealed that the affinity of PGD(2) for CRTH2 is eight times less than its affinity for the DP receptor. 2 Equilibrium competition binding assays revealed that of the compounds tested, only PGD2 and several related metabolites bound with high affinity to CRTH2 (K-i values ranging from 2.4 to 34.0 nM) with the following rank order of potency: PGD(2) > 13,14-dihydro-15-keto PGD(2) > 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) > PGJ(2) > Delta(12)-PGJ(2) > 15(S)-15 methyl-PGD(2). This is in sharp contrast with the rank order of potency obtained at DP : PGD(2) > PGJ(2) > Delta(12)-PGJ(2) > 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) > > > 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD(2). 3 Functional studies demonstrated that PGD2 activation of recombinant CRTH2 results in decrease of intracellular cAMP in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner. Therefore, we showed that CRTH2 can functionally couple to the G-protein G(alphai/o). PGD(2) and related metabolites were tested and their rank order of potency followed the results of the membrane binding assay. 4 By Northern blot analysis, we showed that, besides haemopoietic cells, CRTH2 is expressed in many other tissues such as brain, heart, thymus, spleen and various tissues of the digestive system. In addition, in situ hybridization studies revealed that CRTH2 mRNA is expressed in human eosinophils. Finally, radioligand binding studies demonstrated that two eosinophilic cell lines, butyric acid-differentiated HL-60 and AML 14.3D10, also endogenously express CRTH2.

The most widely used SEPT radiotracer to date, trans-1,2,3,5,6,10-beta-hexahydro-6-[4-(methylthio)phenyl[pyrrolo-[2,1-a]isoquinoline ((+)-C-11-McN5652), has been successful in this regard but may have some limitations. [Recently, another promising SERT radlotracer, 3-(11)Camino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile (C-11-DASB), has been described. The purpose of this study was to compare and contrast (+)-C-11-McN5652 and C-11-DASB under various experimental conditions. Methods: Radioligand comparisons were performed in a control baboon, a baboon with reduced SERT density ((+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA] lesion), and a baboon with reduced SERT availability (paroxetine pretreatment). Under each of these experimental conditions, repeated (triplicate) PET studies were performed with each ligand. Results. Both radiotracers bound preferentially in brain regions known to contain high SERT density. For both ligands, there was a high correlation between the amount of regional brain ligand binding and the known regional brain concentration of SEPT. Binding of both ligands was decreased after MDMA neurotoxicity (reduced SERT density), and (+)-C-11-McN5652 and C-11-DASB were comparably effective in detecting reduced SERT density after MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity. Pretreatment with paroxetine dramatically altered the metabolism and kinetics of both tracers and appeared to displace both ligands primarily from regions with high SERT density. Compared with (+)-C-11-McN5652, C-11-DASB had higher brain activity and a faster washout rate and provided greater contrast between subcortical and cortical brain regions. Conclusion: C-11-DASB and (+)-C-11-McN5652 are suitable as PET ligands of the SERT and for detecting MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity. C-11-DASB may offer some advantages. Additional studies are needed to further characterize the properties and capabilities of both ligands in health and disease.

Pretreatment of Swiss 3T3 cells with either 1 mu M PGF(2 alpha) 1-OH or PGF(2 alpha) 1-OCH3 did not attenuate Ca2+ signal responses produced by PGF(2 alpha) or fluprostenol. In the rat uterus, PGF(2 alpha) 1-OH was about two orders of magnitude less potent than 17-phenyl PGF(2 alpha) whereas PGF(2 alpha) 1-OCH3 produced only a minimal effect. 4 Radioligand binding studies on cat lung parenchymal plasma membrane preparations suggested that the cat lung parenchyma does not contain a homogeneous population of receptors that equally respond to PGF(2 alpha) 1-OH, PGF(2 alpha) 1-OCH3, and classical FP receptor agonists. 5 Studies on smooth muscle preparations and cells containing DP, EP1, EP2, EP3, EP4, IP, and TP receptors indicated that the activity of PGF(2 alpha) 1-OH and PGF(2 alpha) 1-OCH3 could not be ascribed to interaction with these receptors. 6 The potent effects of PGF(2 alpha) 1-OH and PGF(2 alpha) 1-OCH3 on the cat lung parenchyma are difficult to describe in terms of interaction with the FP or any other known prostanoid receptor.

The aim of using this group is to develop simple purification with solid-phase extraction without high-performance liquid chromatography. However, the effects of the neopentyl F-18-labelling group on the characteristics of brain imaging agents are unknown. Here, we added this side-chain to compounds with an aminostilbene structure to evaluate their effects on the biological properties of aminostilbene as an amyloid-beta (A beta) radioligand. Methods: Biodistributions of four novel F-18-labelled stilbene compounds with different lengths of polyethylene glycol (PEG) linkers, called [F-18]Cpd-0, -1, -2, and -4, (PEG= 0, 1, 2, and 4), and [F-18]AV-1 in normal mice were evaluated. Metabolite analysis of [F-18]Cpd-0 and -1 was performed withmouse plasma and brain. A competitive binding assay of [F-18]AV-1 binding to A beta(1-42) fibrils was performed to determine the binding properties of the compounds. Results: [F-18]Cpd-0, -1, and -2 demonstratedmoderate initial brain uptake inmice (3.1-4.2% injected dose/g at 2 min post-injection) followed by fast clearance, and in vivo defluorination of these compounds was negligible. [F-18]Cpd-4 exhibited low brain uptake and high bone uptake. Compared with [F-18]Cpd-1, the percentage of [F-18]Cpd-0 inmouse brain was high at 10 min post-injection. A competitive binding assay revealed partial interference effects by the neopentyl glycol side-chain on binding of stilbene compounds to A beta(1-42) fibrils. Conclusions: Aminostilbene compounds with two or fewer PEG linkers containing an F-18-labelled neopentyl glycol side-chain demonstrated preferable pharmacokinetic properties as a brain imaging radioligand in normal mice. These side-chains can be used as an alternative labelling group for imaging agents targeting the brain. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The objectives of the present study in control subjects were to advance the methodology for quantification of [C-11]VC-002 binding in lung and to examine the reliability using a test-retest paradigm. This work constituted a self-standing preparatory step in a larger clinical trial aiming at estimating mAChR occupancy in the human lungs following inhalation of mAChR antagonists. Methods PET measurements using [C-11]VC-002 and the GE Discovery 710 PET/CT system were performed in seven control subjects at two separate occasions, 2-19 days apart. One subject discontinued the study after the first measurement. Radioligand binding to mAChRs in lung was quantified using an image-derived arterial input function. The total distribution volume (V-T) values were obtained on a regional and voxel-by-voxel basis. Kinetic one-tissue and two-tissue compartment models (1TCM, 2TCM), analysis based on linearization of the compartment models (multilinear Logan) and image analysis by data-driven estimation of parametric images based on compartmental theory (DEPICT) were applied. The test-retest repeatability of V-T estimates was evaluated by absolute variability (VAR) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results The 1TCM was the statistically preferred model for description of [C-11]VC-002 binding in the lungs. Low VAR (< 10%) across analysis methods indicated good reliability of the PET measurements. The V-T estimates were stable after 60 min. Conclusions The kinetic behaviour and good repeatability of [C-11]VC-002 as well as the novel lung image analysis methodology support its application in applied studies on drug-induced mAChR receptor occupancy and the pathophysiology of pulmonary disorders.

Development of a Radioligand, [<SUP>3</SUP>H]LY2119620, to Probe the Human M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>4</sub> Muscarinic Receptor Allosteric Binding Sites	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							IN-VIVO VALIDATION; SUBTYPE SELECTIVITY; ACETYLCHOLINE; MODULATION; AGONIST; IDENTIFICATION; XANOMELINE; DEPENDENCE	In this study, we characterized a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) potentiator, LY2119620 (3-amino-5-chloro-N-cyclopropyl-4-methyl-6-[2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-oxoethoxy]thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxamide) as a novel probe of the human M-2 and M-4 allosteric binding sites. Since the discovery of allosteric binding sites on G protein-coupled receptors, compounds targeting these novel sites have been starting to emerge. For example, LY2033298 (3-amino-5-chloro-6-methoxy-4-methylthieno(2,3-b)pyridine-2-carboxylic acid cyclopropylamid) and a derivative of this chemical scaffold, VU152100 (3-amino-N-(4-methoxybenzyl)-4,6-dimethylthieno[2,3-b]pyridine carboxamide), bind to the human M-4 mAChR allosteric pocket. In the current study, we characterized LY2119620, a compound similar in structure to LY2033298 and binds to the same allosteric site on the human M-4 mAChRs. However, LY2119620 also binds to an allosteric site on the human M-2 subtype. [H-3] NMS ([H-3]N-methylscopolamine) binding experiments confirm that LY2119620 does not compete for the orthosteric binding pocket at any of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes. Dissociation kinetic studies using [H-3] NMS further support that LY2119620 binds allosterically to the M-2 and M-4 mAChRs and was positively cooperative with muscarinic orthosteric agonists. To probe directly the allosteric sites on M-2 and M-4, we radiolabeled LY2119620. Cooperativity binding of [H-3] LY2119620 with mAChR orthosteric agonists detects significant changes in B-max values with little change in K-d, suggesting a G protein-dependent process. Furthermore, [H-3] LY2119620 was displaced by compounds of similar chemical structure but not by previously described mAChR allosteric compounds such as gallamine or WIN 62,577 (17-beta-hydroxy-17-alpha-ethynyl-delta-4-androstano[3,2-b]pyrimido[1,2-a]benzimidazole). Our results therefore demonstrate the development of a radioligand, [H-3] LY2119620 to probe specifically the human M-2 and M-4 muscarinic receptor allosteric binding sites.

None of the currently available PET radioligands for alpha 7-nAChR are suitable for quantitative PET imaging, mostly because of insufficient specific binding. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of F-18-ASEM (18F-JHU82132) as an alpha 7-nAChR radioligand for PET. Methods: The inhibition binding assay and receptor functional properties of ASEM were assessed in vitro. The brain regional distribution of F-18-ASEM in baseline and blockade were evaluated in DISC1 mice (dissection) and baboons (PET). Results: ASEM is an antagonist for the alpha 7-nAChR with high binding affinity (K-i = 0.3 nM). F-18-ASEM readily entered the baboon brain and specifically labeled alpha 7-nAChR. The in vivo specific binding of F-18-ASEM in the brain regions enriched with alpha 7-nAChRs was 80%-90%. SSR180711, an alpha 7-nAChR-selective partial agonist, blocked F-18-ASEM binding in the baboon brain in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the binding of F-18-ASEM was mediated by alpha 7-nAChRs and the radioligand was suitable for drug evaluation studies. In the baboon baseline studies, the brain regional volume of distribution (VT) values for F-18-ASEM were 23 (thalamus), 22 (insula), 18 (hippocampus), and 14 (cerebellum), whereas in the binding selectivity (blockade) scan, all regional VT values were reduced to less than 4. The range of regional binding potential values in the baboon brain was from 3.9 to 6.6. In vivo cerebral binding of (18)FASEM and alpha 7-nAChR expression in mutant DISC1 mice, a rodent model of schizophrenia, was significantly lower than in control animals, which is in agreement with previous postmortem human data. Conclusion: F-18-ASEM holds promise as a radiotracer with suitable imaging properties for quantification of alpha 7-nAChR in the human brain.

But until now, there are only few studies with regard to binding kinetics at H1R. Previous studies from our group revealed an influence of the exchange of N-terminus and E2-loop between hH(1)R and gpH(1)R onto affinity of phenoprodifen to H1R (Strasser A, Wittmann HJ, Seifert R, J Pharmacol Exp Ther 326:783-791, 2008). The aim of this study was, therefore, to examine the impact of the N-terminus and the E2-loop on binding kinetics of the H1R. The wild type hH(1)R and gpH(1)R and the chimeric h(gpE2)H(1)R (E2-loogp from guinea pig) and h(gpNgpE2)H(1)R (N-terminus and E2-loop from guinea pig) were co-expressed with regulator of G-protein signaling protein RGS4 in Sf9 insect cells and kinetic binding studies were performed using the antagonist [H-3]-mepyramine as radioligand. The rate constants for association and dissociation were, in dependence of the ligand, different between hH(1)R and gpH(1)R. Furthermore, the rate constants for association at h(gpNgpE2)H(1)R were significantly different compared to hH(1)R and gpH(1)R. Molecular dynamic simulation studies detected different interactions of amino acid side chains on the extracellular surface of the receptor. Based on these findings, the influence of extracellular surface onto binding kinetics and binding affinity can be explained. Thus, the extracellular surface of G protein-coupled receptors for biogenic amines, exhibits influence onto kinetics of ligand binding, onto ligand recognition and ligand guiding into the binding pocket.

Binding of [H-3]prazosin in rat and mouse brain membranes in vitro was used to characterise the pharmacological profile of alpha(1)-AdRs in order to determine any potential species variations. Saturation and displacement studies yielded comparable affinity and pharmacological profile for [H-3]prazosin binding in mouse and rat brain homogenates. These studies confirmed the absence of species variation for ligands in central alpha(1)-AdR pharmacology which is in good agreement with previous studies in rat brain. Subsequently, in vivo binding of [H-3]prazosin in mouse whole brain was used to measure the occupancy of a number of AdR ligands. Timecourse studies revealed that a [H-3]prazosin (5 muCi/mouse) pretreatment time of at least 20 min following intravenous (i.v.) administration was required for optimal specific binding. Ligands were administered systemically 40 min prior to i.v. administration of radiolabel. The alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ligands prazosin (ED50)=0.15 mg/kg i.p.), benoxathian (0.52 mg/kg i.p.) and phentolamine (51 mg/kg i.p.) were all able to block in vivo [3H]prazosin binding from mouse brain. In addition, receptor occupancy values for a number of compounds including haloperidol (ED50=0.83 mg/kg s.c.), clozapine (2.2 mg/kg s.c.) and MDL-100 907 [R(+)-alpha-(2,3-dimethoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(4-fluorophenylethyl)]-4-piperidine-methanol], (10 mg/kg s.c.)], which possess high to moderate affinity at alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, were also determined. These results suggest that in the mouse, [H-3]prazosin binding can be used to measure in vivo receptor occupancy of ligands with affinity at central alpha(1)-adrenoceptors.

J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4473-4478), as highly potent and selective human A(3) adenosine receptor antagonists is described. The synthesized compounds showed A(3) adenosine receptor affinity in the sub-nanomolar range and high levels of selectivity evaluated in radioligand binding assays at human A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors. In particular, the effect of the chain at the Ns pyrazole nitrogen was analyzed. This study allowed us to identify the derivative with the methyl group at the N-8 pyrazole combined with the 4-methoxyphenylcarbamoyl moiety at the N-5 position as the compound with the best binding profile in terms of both affinity and selectivity (hA(3) = 0.2 nM, hA(1)/hA(3) = 5485, hA(2A)/hA(3) = 6950, hA(2B)/hA(3) = 1305). All the compounds proved to be full antagonists in a specific functional model where the inhibition of cAMP generation by IB-MECA was measured in membranes of CHO cells stably transfected with the human A(3) receptor. The new compounds are among the most potent and selective A(3) antagonists so far described. The derivatives with higher affinity at human A(3) adenosine receptors proved to be antagonists, in the cAMP assay, capable of inhibiting the effect of IB-MECA with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, with a trend strictly similar to that observed in the binding assay. Also a molecular modeling study was carried out, with the aim to identify possible pharmacophore maps. In fact, a sterically controlled structure-activity relationship was found for the N-8 pyrazole substituted derivatives, showing a correlation between the calculated molecular volume of pyrazolo[4,3-e]1,2,4-triazolo [1,5-c]-pyrimidine derivatives and their experimental K-i values.

In the central nervous system (CNS), S1PR1 is expressed in different types of cells including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells. S1PR1 has been recognized as a novel therapeutic target in multiple sclerosis and other diseases. We previously reported a promising S1PR1-specific radioligand, [C-11]CS1P1 (previously named [C-11]TZ3321), which is under clinical investigation for human use. In the current study, we performed a detailed characterization of [H-3]CS1P1 for its binding specificity to S1PR1 in CNS using autoradiography and immunohistochemistry in human and rat CNS tissues. Our data indicate that [H-3]CS1P1 binds to S1PR1 in human frontal cortex tissue with a K-d of 3.98 nM and a B-max of 172.5 nM. The distribution of [H-3]CS1P1 in human and rat CNS tissues is consistent with the distribution of S1PR1 detected by immunohistochemistry studies. Our microPET studies of [C-11]CS1P1 in a nonhuman primate (NHP) show a standardized uptake value of 2.4 in the NHP brain, with test-retest variability of 0.23% among six different NHPs. Radiometabolite analysis in the plasma samples of NHP and rat, as well as in rat brain samples, showed that [C-11]CS1P1 was stable in vivo. Kinetic modeling studies using a two-compartment tissue model showed that the positron emission tomography (PET) data fit the model well. Overall, our study provides a detailed characterization of [H-3]CS1P1 binding to S1PR1 in the CNS. Combined with our microPET studies in the NHP brain, our data suggest that [C-11]CS1P1 is a promising radioligand for PET imaging of S1PR1 in the CNS.

In addition, the alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor (low affinity for prazosin), a functional phenotype of alpha(1A), has been described. The purpose of this work was to analyze the expression, cellular localization and coupling to membrane signalling (inositol phosphate accumulation) of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes in a native tissue, the rat cerebral cortex. mRNA for the three subtypes was quantified by real-time RT-PCR (alpha(1D)>alpha(1B)>>alpha(1A)). alpha(1)-Adrenoceptors were also detected by immunoblotting, revealing alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors to be predominantly expressed in the membrane fraction and the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor to be localized in the cytosolic fraction. Competitive radioligand binding studies revealed the presence of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor in tissue homogenates, whereas only alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-subtypes were detected in membranes. The proportion of am-adrenoceptor increased after treatment with noradrenaline, suggesting differences in agonist-mediated trafficking. Saturation experiments detected high- and low (alpha(1A/L))-prazosin binding sites, the latter of which disappeared on incubation with GppNHp. The alpha(1A/L)-adrenoceptor was heavily implicated in the inositol phosphate response, while the alpha(1D)-subtype did not play a relevant role. These results suggest that the predominant cytosolic localization of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor lies behind its poor coupling to membrane signalling such as inositol phosphate pathway. The fact that the alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor detected in radioligand binding studies disappeared in the presence of GppNHp implies that it represents a conformational state of the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor coupled to G-protein.

We examined the properties of 8-OH-DPAT and its enantiomers at recombinant human (h)alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes, using a panel of radioligand binding and functional tests. In competition binding experiments using [H-3]-RX821002, about 10-fold selectivity of (+)8-OH-DPAT for the ham subtype (pK(i) about 7) over h alpha(2A)- and h alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors was observed. In contrast, the S() enantiomer of 8-0H-DPAT showed similar weak affinities for the three receptor subtypes (pKis <6). The binding affinity of ( +)8-0H-DPAT at the h alpha(2B)- and the h alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor was found sensitive to GTP gamma S, a receptor/G protein-uncoupling agent, indicating agonist properties of the drug. Furthermore, using [S-35]GTP gamma S binding determination at CHO-h alpha(28) or CHO-h alpha(2A) cell membranes and G protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) current recordings in Xenopus oocytes expressing h alpha(28), partial agonist activity of (+)8-0H-DPAT at the respective receptors was confirmed in these two different functional assays. Potency of (+)8-0H-DPAT for stimulation of [S-35]GTPyS incorporation was lower at the h alpha(2A)- than at the h alpha(2B)-adrenoceptor, consistent with binding affinities. Thus, ( +)8-0H-DPAT and, as a consequence, racemic (+/-)8-OH-DPAT are partial agonists at h alpha(2)-drenoceptors with selectivity for the ha28 subtype, a property that might contribute to the effects of the compound described in native systems.

In myocytes, SM-20550 concentration-dependently inhibited the recovery from acidosis induced by an NH4Cl prepulse in HCO3--free solution. Its IC50 was 10(-8) M, which was 10 times lower than that of ethylisopropyl amiloride (EIPA). SM-20550 (10(-6) M) did not affect the Na+-dependent Ca2+ influx (Na+/Ca2+ exchange activity) in cardiomyocytes. In the radioligand binding assay, SM-20550 did not have affinity for K+ channel, beta-adrenoceptor, adenosine, angiotensin, or endothelin receptors, and had low affinity for Na+ and Ca2+ channels and alpha-adrenoceptors, only at the concentrations of 10(-6)-10(-5) ill. In perfused hearts exposed to 40 min of global ischemia and 20 min of reperfusion, SM-20550 (10(-8)-10(-7) M) significantly reduced the elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure during reperfusion, improved the postischemic recovery of developed pressure, and prevented coronary perfusion pressure increase after reperfusion. Furthermore, SM-20550 reduced creatine phosphokinase release during reperfusion and prevented the abnormal gain of tissue Na+ and Ca2+ at the end of reperfusion. These results suggest that SM-20550 is a potent, highly specific Na+/H+ exchange inhibitor, which exerts a protective effect against myocardial ischemia/ reperfusion injury. In addition, our data strongly support the hypothesis that Na+/H+ exchange plays an important role in the development of postischemic cardiac dysfunction, most likely by inducing Na+ and Ca2+ overload.

Rat pancreas uptake of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]dihydrotetrabenazine stereoisomers	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Vesicular transporter; Monoamine; Pancreas	VESICULAR MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER; BETA-CELL MASS; DIHYDROTETRABENAZINE; TETRABENAZINE; BINDING	(+)-alpha-[C-11]Dihydrotetrabenazine ((+)-[C-11]DTBZ), a radioligand for the vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2), has been previously proposed as an in vivo marker of beta-cell degeneration in the pancreas. The stereospecificity of uptake of [C-11]DTBZ into rat pancreas was examined here using radiolabeled forms of the (+)- and (-)-isomers. Pancreas localization of (+)-[C-11]DTBZ could be partially blocked by prior administration of unlabeled (+)-DTBZ. Pancreatic uptake of the (-)-isomer was unexpectedly high and could not be blocked by pretreatment with (+)-DTBZ, but could be significantly reduced by treatment with racemic tetrabenazine, an in vivo source of (-)-DTBZ. These studies indicate that the inactive isomer of DTBZ does not provide a mechanism for defining the nonspecific binding of (+)-DTBZ in rat pancreas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The basic amino acids Arg(120) and Arg(292) ion pair with the phosphate, whereas the acidic Glu(121) residue ion pairs with the ammonium moiety of sphingosine l-phosphate. The requirement of these interactions for specific ligand recognition has been confirmed through examination of site-directed mutants by radioligand binding, ligand-induced [S-35]GTP gammaS binding, and receptor internalization assays. These ion-pairing interactions explain the ligand specificity of the Edg1 receptor and provide insight into ligand specificity differences within the Edg receptor family. This computational map of the ligand binding pocket provides information necessary for understanding the molecular pharmacology of this receptor, thus underlining the potential of the computational method in predicting ligand-receptor interactions.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen-Ligand Therapy What the Radiologist Needs to Know	RADIOLOGIC CLINICS OF NORTH AMERICA			English	Article						PRLT; Prostate cancer; Radioligand therapy; Theranostics; Endoradiotherapy	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; CANCER; PET/CT; PROGRESSION; CRITERIA; MEN	In an era in which more and more patients with PCa are treated with multiple agents in the up-front metastatic setting, orthogonal therapies that leverage new targets via novel mechanisms are necessary. PRLT is one such approach, whereby the near universal expression of PSMA is used to deliver cytotoxic levels of radiation to the PCa cells. This approach requires specialized personnel and careful selection of patients to optimize efficacy while limiting toxicity. Although PRLT with Lu-177-labeled agents is already an accepted standard-of-care for men with mCRPC who have previously been treated with chemotherapy, there remains a tremendous amount to learn. Eventually, new therapeutic agents will coalesce with improved nomograms and patient-selection algorithms, as well as AI, to maximally benefit patients.

The oldest and most prominent field of application of theranostics in oncology is differentiated thyroid cancer treated by radioiodine therapy, which allows imaging of the iodine uptake and thus tumor manifestations by gamma (gamma) radiation of radioiodine. Other areas of application include neuroendocrine tumors, castration-resistant prostate cancer and, in the context of individual therapeutic approaches, fibroblastic tumors. Imaging with beta-plus (beta(+)) emitters is mainly performed using so-called hybrid imaging: positron emission tomography (PET) in combination with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (PET/CT or PET/MRI). Beta-minus (beta(-)) emitters are predominantly used in therapy, but the use of alpha (alpha) emitters is also increasing, thus, enabling targeted cancer treatment with mostly low-grade side effects.

Synthetic routes for the preparation of the precursor of [C-11]PIB are reported in the literature. These strategies require multiple steps and the use of protecting groups. This paper describes a simple one-step synthesis of the precursor of [C-11]PIB through a Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reaction using thermal conditions or microwave activation. These methods were successfully applied to the synthesis of various 2-arylbenzothiazole and 2-pyridinylbenzothiazole compounds including [F-18] precursor derivatives of PIB containing a nitro function.

This approach uses an existing technology, the regulated secretion/aggregation technology (RPD (TM)), to cause the accumulation of G protein-coupled receptors in the ER of cells. The trafficking of accumulated receptor from the ER to the plasma membrane of cells can be initiated by a small, membrane permeable ligand. The plasma membrane delivery of receptors can be monitored using radioligand binding or microscopy or both techniques. Using this new approach it should be possible to determine the rate of plasma membrane delivery of a broad range of G protein-coupled receptors and thus facilitate learning more about their anterograde trafficking mechanisms.

Measuring drug occupancy in the absence of a reference region: the Lassen plot re-visited	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						graphical analysis; occupancy; PET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN TRANSFER CONSTANTS; TIME UPTAKE DATA; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; IN-VIVO; PET; BINDING; RECEPTORS; HUMANS; MODEL	Quantitative estimation of neuroreceptor occupancy by exogenous drugs using positron emission tomography is based on the reduction in the total volume of distribution (V(T)) of site-specific radioligands after drug administration. An estimate of the distribution volume of free and non-specifically bound radioligand (V(ND)) is also required to distinguish specific from total binding. However, a true reference region, devoid of specific binding, is often not available. We present a transformation of a graphical method, originally introduced by Lassen, using regional estimates of V(T) alone to determine occupancy, together with an extension that does not require baseline data.

TSLP receptor (TSLPR) is a member of the hematopoietin receptor family. Transfection of TSLPR cDNA resulted in only low affinity binding. Cotransfection of the interleukin 7 (IL-7)R alpha chain cDNA resulted in conversion to high affinity binding. TSLP did not activate cells from IL7R alpha(-/-) mice, but did activate cells h-om gamma c(-/-) mice. Thus, the functional TSLPR requires the IL-7R alpha chain, but not the gamma c chain for signaling.

In perfusion-fixed sections, RLN3 immunoreactivity (IR) was observed throughout the fore-, mid-, and hindbrain and was enriched in the septum, hippocampus, and interpeduncular and supramammillary nuclei. Neurons in the pontine central gray area contained RLN3-IR and RLN3 mRNA. The distribution of RXFP3 protein, mapped by autoradiography of [I-125]R3/I5-binding sites, correlated with the distribution of RLN3-IR. The broad distributions of RLN3-positive neuronal axons and terminals and of RXFP3 in the brain of Macaca fascicularis are consistent with findings in the rat and with an important role for RLN3 signaling in nonhuman primate and human brain.

G protein-coupled receptor P2Y5 and its ligand LPA are involved in maintenance of human hair growth	NATURE GENETICS			English	Article							LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID; INTERNATIONAL UNION; GENE; IDENTIFICATION; HYPOTRICHOSIS; PHARMACOLOGY; MUTATIONS; GPR92; 6H1	Hypotrichosis simplex is a group of nonsyndromic human alopecias. We mapped an autosomal recessive form of this disorder to chromosome 13q14.11-13q21.33, and identified homozygous truncating mutations in P2RY5, which encodes an orphan G protein-coupled receptor. Furthermore, we identified oleoyl-L-alpha-lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioactive lipid, as a ligand for P2Y5 in reporter gene and radioligand binding experiments. Homology and studies of signaling transduction pathways suggest that P2Y5 is a member of a subgroup of LPA receptors, which also includes LPA4 and LPA5. Our study is the first to implicate a G protein-coupled receptor as essential for and specific to the maintenance of human hair growth. This finding may provide opportunities for new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of hair loss in humans.

Clathrin-dependent internalization of the angiotensin II AT<sub>1A</sub> receptor links receptor internalization to COX-2 protein expression in rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Angiotensin II; AT(1A) receptor; NF-kappa B; Cyclooxygenase 2; Clathrin-mediated endocytosis; Vascular smooth muscle cells	ARRESTIN-BIASED LIGAND; BETA-ARRESTIN; NUCLEAR ACCUMULATION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; ENDOCYTOSIS; ACTIVATION; TRV120027; HEART	The major effects of Angiutensin II (AngII) in vascular tissue are mediated by AngII AT(1A) receptor activation. Certain effects initiated by AT(1A) receptor activation require receptor internalization. In rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (RASMC). AngII stimulates cyclooxygenase 2 protein expression. We have previously shown this is mediated by beta-arrestin-dependent receptor internalization and NF-kappa B activation. In this study, a specific inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), pitstop-2, was used to test the hypothesis that clathrin-dependent internalization or activated AT(1A) receptor mediates NF-kappa B activation and subsequent cyclooxygenase 2 expression. Radioligand binding assays, real time qt-PCR and immunoblotting were used to document the effects of pitstop-2 on AngII binding and signaling in RASMC. Laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) was used to image pitstop-2's effects on AT(1) receptor/GFP internalization in HEK-293 cells and p65 NF-kappa B nuclear localization in RASMC. Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited internalization of AT(1A) receptor (44.7% +/- 3.1% Control vs. 13.2% perpendicular to 8.3% Pitstop-2; n=3) as determined by radioligand binding studies in RASMC. Studies utilizing AT(1A) receptor/GFP expressed in HEK 293 cells and LSCM confirmed these findings. Pitstop-2 significantly inhibited AngII-induced p65 NE-kappa B phosphorylation and nuclear localization, COX-2 message and protein expression in RASMC without altering activation of p42/44 ERK or TNF alpha signaling. Pitstop-2, a specific inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, confirms that internalization of activated AT(1A) receptor mediates AngII activation of cyclooxygenase 2 expression in RASMC. These data provide support for additional intracellular signaling pathways activated through beta-arrestin mediated internalization of G protein-coupled receptors, such as AT(1A) receptors.

Procedures: Quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of intestinal inflammation was conducted with 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG) a glucose metabolism surrogate marker and [F-18]DPA-714 a ligand of the 18 kDa TSPO, on two IBD models. The first model was induced using dextran sodium sulfate (DSS), creating global inflammation in the colon. The second model was induced by rectally administering trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS), creating local and acute inflammation. Results: The level of inflammation was analyzed using PET imaging on days 7 and 8. The analysis obtained with [F-18]DPA-714, yielded a significant difference between the DSS treated (0.50 +/- 0.17% ID/cc) and non-treated rats (0.35 +/- 0.15% ID/cc). [F-18]FDG on the other hand did not yield a significant difference. We did observe a mean glucose consumption in the colon increase from 0.40 +/- 0.11% ID/cc to 0.54 +/- 0.17% ID/cc. In the TNBS model, the uptake level of [F-18]DPA-714 increased significantly from 0.46 +/- 0.23% ID/cc for the non-treated group, to 1.30 +/- 0.62% ID/cc for those treated. PET signal was correlated with increased TSPO expression at cellular level. Conclusions: Results indicate that [F-18]DPA-714 is suitable for studying inflammation in IBD models. [F-18]DPA-714 could be a good molecular probe to non-invasively evaluate the level and localization of inflammation. Moreover, in vivo imaging using this TSPO ligand is potentially a powerful tool to stage and certainly to follow the evolution and therapeutic efficiency at molecular level within this disease family.

The Influence of Receptor Kinetics on the Onset and Duration of Action and the Therapeutic Index of NVA237 and Tiotropium	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; MUSCARINIC M-3 RECEPTOR; INHALED ANTICHOLINERGICS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; GUINEA-PIG; LONG; COPD; ANTAGONIST; DRUGS; BRONCHODILATOR	Studies under nonphysiological conditions suggest that long receptor residency time is responsible for the 24-h duration of action of the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium. Our aim was to determine how clinically relevant dissociation rates under more physiological conditions influence the differences in onset of action between tiotropium and 3-[(cyclopentylhydroxyphenylacetyl oxy]-1,1-dimethyl-pyrrolidinium bromide (NVA237), a once-daily dry-powder formulation of the LAMA glycopyrronium bromide in development for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In addition, we have investigated kinetic selectivity at each of the muscarinic receptor subtypes to determine whether the improved cardiovascular therapeutic index obtained with NVA237 in animal models is attributable to differences in kinetic rate constants. The binding of radioligand [H-3]N-methyl-scopolamine was measured in the presence/absence of several concentrations of unlabeled competitors, and data were analyzed using a competition kinetic model to provide on/off rates for the competitor. We found shorter dissociation half-lives for NVA237 and tiotropium under physiological (11.4 and 46.2 min, respectively) versus nonphysiological conditions (173 and 462 min, respectively). NVA237 had a more rapid onset of action (3-4.8 times) versus tiotropium, determined in an vitro calcium and rat tracheal strip assay. Simulations suggested that the more rapid onset of NVA237 action could be explained by differences in kinetic parameters. NVA237 had greater equilibrium binding and kinetic selectivity for muscarinic type 3 (M 3) versus muscarinic type 2 (M 2) receptors, with a faster off rate from M 2 versus M 3 receptors than tiotropium, potentially affording it a more favorable therapeutic index. This study suggests that the 24-h duration of action of NVA237 and tiotropium is not solely the result of their slow dissociation from the M 3 receptor and highlights the importance of conducting in vitro experiments in conditions reflecting those in vivo.

Synthesis, radiolabeling, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-FPECMO as a positron emission tomography radioligand for imaging the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5; FPECMO; Radiosynthesis	BASAL GANGLIA; MGLUR5; PET; POTENT; RADIOSYNTHESIS	Introduction: [F-18]-(E)-3-((6-Fluoropyridin-2-yl)ethynyl)cyclohex-2-enone O-methyl oxime ([F-18]-FPECMO) is a novel derivative of [C-11]-ABP688. [F-18]-FPECMO was characterized as a PET imaging agent for the metabotropic glutamate receptor Subtype 5 (mGluR5). Methods: [F-18]-FPECMO was synthesized in a one-step reaction sequence by reacting [F-18]-KF-K-222 complex with (E)-3-((6-bromopyridin2-yl)ethynyl)cyclohex-2-enone O-methyl oxime in dry DMSO. The in vitro affinity of FPECMO was determined by displacement assays using rat whole brain homogenates (without cerebellum) and the mGluR5-specific radioligand [H-3]-M-MPEP. Further in vitro characterization involved metabolite studies, lipophilicity determination and autoradiographical analyses of brain slices. In vivo evaluation was performed by postmortem biodistribution studies and PET experiments using Sprague-Dawley rats. Results: The radiochemical yield after semipreparative HPLC was 35 +/- 7% and specific activity was >240 GBq/mu mol. [F-18]-FPECMO exhibited optimal lipophilicity (logD=2.1) and high metabolic stability in vitro. Displacement studies revealed a K-i value of 3.6 +/- 0.7 nM for FPECMO. Biodistribution Studies and ex vivo autoradiography showed highest radioactivity accumulation in mGluR5-rich brain regions such as the striatum and hippocampus. Co-injection of [F-18]-FPECMO and ABP688 (1 mg/kg body weight), an mGluR5 antagonist, showed 40% specific binding in the striatum, hippocampus and cortex, regions known to contain high densities of the mGluR5. PET imaging, however, did not allow the visualization of mGluR5-rich brain regions in the rat brain due to a fast washout of [F-18]-FPECMO from mGluR5-expressing tissues and rapid defluorination. Conclusions: [F-18]-FPECMO showed significant potential for the detection of mGluR5 in vitro; however, its in vivo characteristics are not optimal for a clear-cut Visualization of the mGluR5 in rats.

Native profiles of α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenoceptor phenotypes in rabbit prostate	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						prostate; receptor phenotype; adrenergic; alpha(1A)and alpha(1L); radioligand-binding assay	TISSUE SEGMENT BINDING; ALPHA-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; LOWER URINARY-TRACT; ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; RAT; RECEPTORS; ALPHA(1L)-ADRENOCEPTOR; CLASSIFICATION; IDENTIFICATION	Background and purpose: alpha(1)-Adrenoceptors in the rabbit prostate have been studied because of their controversial pharmacological profiles in functional and radioligand binding studies. The purpose of the present study is to determine the native profiles of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor phenotypes and to clarify their relationship. Experimental approach: Binding experiments with [H-3]-silodosin and [H-3]-prazosin were performed using intact tissue segments and crude membrane preparations of rabbit prostate and the results were compared with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated prostate contraction. Key results: [H-3]-Silodosin at subnanomolar concentrations bound specifically to intact tissue segments of rabbit prostate. However, [H-3]-prazosin at the same range of concentrations failed to bind to alpha(1)-adrenoceptors of intact segments. Binding sites of [H-3]-silodosin in intact segments were composed of alpha(1L) phenotype with low affinities for prazosin (pKi = 7.1), 5-methyurapidil and N-[2-(2-cyclopropylmethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-5-chloro-alpha,alpha-dimethyl-1H-indole-3-ethamine hydrochloride (RS-17053), and alpha(1A)-like phenotype with moderate affinity for prazosin (pKi 8.8) but high affinity for 5-methyurapidil and RS-17053. In contrast, both radioligands bound to a single population of alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the membrane preparations at the same density with a subnanomolar affinity, showing a typical profile of ' classical ' alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors (pKi for prazosin 9.8). The pharmacological profile of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-mediated prostate contraction was in accord with the a1L phenotype observed by intact segment binding approach. Conclusions and implications: Three distinct phenotypes (alpha(1L) and alpha(1A)-like phenotypes in the intact segments and a classical alpha(1A) phenotype in the membranes) with different affinities for prazosin were detected in rabbit prostate. It appears that the three phenotypes are phenotypic subtypes of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors, but are not genetically different subtypes.	[Su, T-H; Morishima, S.; Suzuki, F.; Yoshiki, H.; Anisuzzaman, A.

In Wistar rats, intravenous injections of eugenosedin-B (2.4, 7.2, 12 mu moL/kg) caused a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure and heart rate. In contrast, intracisternal injection of eugenosedin-B (0.3, 0.03 mu moL) and an alpha(2)-antagonist yohimbine (0.03 mu moL) increased blood pressure and heart rate. Eugenosedin-B and yohimbine prevented hypotension induced by intracisternal injection of an alpha(2)-agonist clonidine (38 pmol). In in vitro experiments, eugenosedin-B (10(-9), 10(-8), 10(-7) M) competitively antagonized norepinephrine-, clonidine-, and 5-HT (10(-8) to 10(-4) M)-induced vasocontractions in isolated rat aorta. It also competitively antagonized the isoproterenol (10(-8) to 10(-4) M)-induced positive inotropic effects in isolated rat atrium. These findings clearly suggest that eugenosedin-B possesses alpha(1), alpha(2), beta(1), and 5-HT,, receptor blocking activities. In isolated rabbit ear artery sensitized with 16 mM K+, eugenosedin-B antagonized 5-nonyloxytryptamine- and 5-HT-induced vasocontractions, indicating it also blocked 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors. In radioligand-binding experiments, eugenosedin-B had significant binding affinities on alpha(1), alpha(2), beta(1), 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A receptors. In human platelets, eugenosedin-B inhibited epinephrine and 5-HT-induced aggregations. It also had competitive binding effects in human platelet with [H-3]yohimbine (alpha(2)), [H-3]ketanserin (5-HT2A). We conclude that hypotensive and vasorelaxant effects of eugenosedin-B can be attributed to its multiple actions on the blockade of 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, alpha(1/2) and beta(1) receptors, and its ability to reduce platelet aggregation attributed to its blockade of alpha(2) and 5-HT2A receptors.

METHODS: The PIMs isolated from rat lung tissues were purified by the collagenase digestion method combined with alveolar lavage and pulmonary vessel perfusion. The expression of CCK-R mRNA was detected by RT-PCR and Southern blot analysis and the binding experiments were performed by radioligand binding assay (RBA). RESULTS: CCK-A receptor (CCK-AR) and CCK-B receptor (CCK-BR) mRNA were detected in rat PIMs and their RT-PCR amplified products had a size of approximately 1.37 kb and 480 bp, respectively. The relative expression of CCK-BR mRNA was higher than that of CCK-AR mRNA after incubation with LPS for 0.5, 2, and 6 h. The expression of CCK-R mRNA could be upregulated obviously by LPS. Southern blot analysis of RT-PCR amplified CCK-AR and CCK-BR mRNA products using [gamma-P-32]ATP 5'-end-labelled probe showed specific hybridization bands. The specific binding of [H-3] CCK-8S to rat PIM membranes was detected in the rats administered with LPS for 48 h, but not in normal rats. Scatchard analysis of the saturation curves suggested the presence of CCK-R with a high affinity (K-d=0.68 +/- 0.28 nmol/L) and a low binding capacity (B-max=32.5 +/- 2.7 fmol(.)mg(-1) protein) in rat PIMs. The specific binding of [H-3] CCK-8S to rat PIM membranes was inhibited by unlabelled CCK-8S (IC50=2.3 +/- 0.8 nmol/L), CCK-AR specific antagonist CR1409 (IC50=0.19 +/- 0.06 mumol/L) and CCK-BR specific antagonist CR2945 (IC50=3.2 +/- 1.1 nmol/L). CONCLUSION: Two types of functional CCK-AR and CCK-BR existed in rat PIMs and their expression could be upregulated by LPS.

(R)-(+) and (S)-(-) enantiomers of bisoprolol were labelled with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) as putative tracers for the non-invasive assessment of the beta1-adrenoceptor subtype in the human heart and brain with positron emission tomography (PET). The radiosynthesis consisted of reductive alkylation of des-iso-propyl precursor with [2-C-11]acetone in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride and acetic acid. The stereo-conservative synthesis of (R)-(+) and (S)-(-)-1-[4-(2-isopropoxyethoxymethyl)-phenoxyl-3-amino-2-propanol to be used as the precursors for the radiosynthesis of [C-11]bisoprolol enantiomcrs was readily accomplished by the use of the corresponding chiral epoxide in three steps starting From the commercially available hydroxybenzyl alcohol. The final labelled product (either (+) or (-)- 1-[4-(-isopropoxq;ethoxymethyl)phenoxy]-3- [C-11]isopropylamino-2-propanol) was obtained in 99% radiochemical purity in 30 min with 15+/-5% (EOS, non decay corrected) radiochemical yield and 3.5+/-1 Ci/mu mol specific radioactivity. Preliminary biological evaluation of the tracer in rats showed that about 30% of heart uptake of [C-11](S)-bisoprolol is due to specific binding. The high non-specific uptake in lung might mask the heart uptake, thus precluding the use of [C-11](S)-bisoprolol for heart and lung studies by PET. The remarkably high uptake of the tracer in rat brain areas rich of P-adrenergic receptors such as pituitary (1.8+/-0.3% I.D. at 30 min) was blocked by pre-treatment with the P-adrenergic antagonists propranolol (45%) and bisoprolol (51%, p< 0.05). [C-11](S)-bisoprolol deserves further evaluation in other animal models as a putative Pi selective radioligand for in vivo investigation of central adrenoceptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The dopaminergic pathway has been largely characterized with PET imaging due to the existence of large number of radiotracers available to bind to the different targets of this system. Thus, the selection of the radiotracer depends on the particular aspect of the dopaminergic system to be studied. In this chapter, a methodological PET study of the D-2/D-3 receptor bioavailability with [C-11]raclopride is described. Likewise, the preparation steps for the synthesis of [C-11]raclopride as well as the protocols of PET/CT acquisition, reconstruction, and quantification of the data are presented.

Here we find that physical models of complex dissociation predict that competitor molecules will, in general, accelerate the breakdown of isolated bimolecular complexes by occluding rapid rebinding of the two binding partners. This prediction is largely independent of molecular details. We confirm the prediction with single-molecule fluorescence experiments on a well-characterized DNA strand dissociation reaction. Contrary to common assumptions, competitor-induced acceleration of dissociation can occur in biologically relevant competitor concentration ranges and does not necessarily imply ternary association of competitor with the bimolecular complex. Thus, occlusion of complex rebinding may play a significant role in a variety of biomolecular processes. The results also show that single-molecule colocalization experiments can accurately measure dissociation rates despite their limited spatiotemporal resolution.

Recently, two neuromyelitis optica patients with hypersomnia, hypothalamic lesions, serum anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies, and reduced cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin levels were reported. We hypothesized that anti-AQP4 antibodies induce hypocretin dysfunction leading to hypersomonia in a subgroup of narcolepsy or hypersomnia patients. In this study, we screened for anti-AQP4 antibodies in sera from 251 patients with narcolepsy, 34 with other hypersomnias, and 200 healthy controls by using the radioligand binding assay method. A positive result for anti-AQP4 antibodies was found only in one healthy control subject. All the hypersomnia patients were negative for this antibody. Our results indicated that anti-AQP4 antibody is not useful as a diagnostic marker for narcolepsy and other hypersomnias.

We have utilized both orthosteric ligands and allosteric modulators of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical Family A GPCR, to probe possible E2 loop binding dynamics. We developed a homology model based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin and predicted novel cysteine substitutions that should dramatically reduce E2 loop flexibility via disulfide bond formation and significantly inhibit the binding of both types of ligands. This prediction was validated experimentally using radioligand binding, dissociation kinetics, and cell-based functional assays. The results argue for a flexible "gatekeeper" role of the E2 loop in the binding of both allosteric and orthosteric GPCR ligands.

Flavonoids as antagonists at A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptors	PHYTOTHERAPY RESEARCH			English	Article						flavonoids; A(1); adenosine receptors; guinea-pigbrain; guinea-pigileum	GUINEA-PIG ILEUM; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CELLS; INHIBITION; CAFFEINE; POTENCY; ANALOGS	This study aimed to investigate the potential for flavonoid action at A(1) adenosine receptors in vitro. In a radioligand binding assay for A(1) adenosine receptor occupancy in particulate preparations from guinea-pig cerebral cortex, Havonoids competed in concentration-dependent manners with Hill slopes typically not different from unity. Of the flavonoids tested, quercetin showed highest affinity (pK(i) value of 5.33). At a concentration of 28 mu m, quercetin evoked a rightward shift in the N-6-cyclopentyladenosine-induced inhibition of electrically evoked contractions of the guinea-pig isolated ileum, allowing the calculation of a pK(i) value of 4.71. These data suggest, therefore, that flavonoids represent an additional dietary source of A(1) adenosine receptor antagonists (beyond the methylxanthines, caffeine and theophylline).

In this study we investigated the effects of MSH peptides on sexual receptivity in Qvariectomized-adrenalectomized female rats, pretreated with benzoate of estradiol, in presence of vigorous male rats. The results show that alpha -MSH significantly increases lordosis behavior in female rats after injections into the ventromedial nucleus. Interestingly, we have for the first time shown that gamma -MSH also causes significant increase in lordosis in female rats. Furthermore, we show that HS014, an antagonist for the central MC receptors, in dose dependent manner blocks the effect of alpha -MSH on lordosis. The results indicate that the effects of MSH peptides on female sexual behaviour are mediated through a specific MC receptor, which could be the MC3 receptor. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

COMT Val<SUP>158</SUP>Met Genotype and Striatal D<sub>2/3</sub> Receptor Binding in Adults with 22q11 Deletion Syndrome	SYNAPSE			English	Article						catechol-O-methyltransferase; dopamine; SPECT; striatum; D-2/3 receptor binding	CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; SCALE; MICE; PET	Although catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) activity evidently affects dopamine function in prefrontal cortex, the contribution is assumed less significant in striatum. We studied whether a functional polymorphism in the COMT gene (Val(158)Met) influences striatal D2/3R binding ratios (D2/3R BPND) in 15 adults with 22q11 deletion syndrome and hemizygous for this gene, using single photon emission computed tomography and the selective D-2/3 radioligand [I-123]IBZM. Met hemizygotes had significantly lower mean D2/3R BPND than Val hemizygotes. These preliminary data suggest that low COMT activity may affect dopamine levels in striatum in humans and this may have implications for understanding the contribution of COMT activity to psychiatric disorders.

[C-11]1 was tested in porcine and non-human primate models to assess its potential as a radioligand for PET imaging of the dopamine D-3 receptor.

In rodents, specific binding of [C-11]TMSX was observed in muscle and heart by blockade with A(2A)-selective CSC and non-selective theophylline, but not with A(1)-selective DPCPX. Swimming exercise fluctuated radioligand-receptor binding in these tissues. In a PET study of two subjects, theophylline-infusion slightly deceased the distribution volume of [C-11]TMSX in the heart (20% reduction) and muscle (10% reduction), which suggested the specific binding.

In the present study, we performed a preclinical study. The radiation absorbed-dose by [C-11]MPDX in humans estimated from the tissue distribution in mice was low enough for clinical use, and the acute toxicity and mutagenicity of MPDX were not found. The monkey brain was clearly visualized by PET with [C-11]MPDX. We have concluded that [C-11]MPDX is suitable for mapping adenosine A(1) receptors in the human brain by PET.

The objective of this study was to verify the effects of busp on RD2. Female Wistar rats 150-200 g were treated with busp (5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o,) 1 or 2 times daily for 7 days. Controls (C) received saline. The density of RD2 (fmol/mg protein) was determined through binding assays in striatum (ST) using [H-3]-spiroperidol as radioligand. No alteration in Bmax or Kd values were seen after busp administration once a day. However, a RD2 upregulation of 55 % increase was observed after busp 2 times a day with no change in Kd values. The results showed that busp interact not only with serotonergic, but also with dopaminergic system.

In an effort to identify radioligands well suited for imaging these peripheral sites, we have prepared and evaluated four hydrophilic In-111 labeled DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) conjugated mu tetrapeptides. Methods: Peptides were prepared by solid-phase techniques, using orthogonal strategies to achieve branching to DOTA, and then characterized by HPLC, mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. Scaffolds included novel peptide H-Dmt-D-Ala-Phe-Orn-NH2 (DAPO), where Dmt = 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine, and known peptide H-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2 ([Dmt(1)]DALDA). Constructs had DOTA conjugation at the Orn(4) or Lys(4) side chains, or to the C-terminal through a hexanoic acid-lysine linker. Indium(III) complexation and In-111 radiolabeling were accomplished by standard methods. Protein binding and Log D-7.4 were determined. Binding and pharmacological profiles were obtained in vitro. Biodistribution and radiometabolite studies were conducted using male CD-1 mice. Results: All four indium(III)-DOTA conjugates derived from DAPO and [Dmt(1)]DALDA showed good selectivity and subnanomolar affinity for mu opioid receptors. One radioligand, H-Dmt-D-Ala-Phe-Orn(delta In-111[ln-DOTA)-NH2, showed 25% specific binding in vivo to sites in mouse gut. Notably, this was the least polar of the series, and also showed low sensitivity to modulation of binding by sodium ions. All radioligands showed high kidney uptake of radiometabolites. Conclusions: Visualizing peripheral mu opioid receptors using In-111 labeled DOTA-conjugated tetrapeptides appears feasible, but structural modifications to enhance specific binding and metabolic stability, as well as to reduce kidney uptake, will be required. Advances in knowledge: This study shows in vivo labeling of peripheral mu opioid receptors by a tetrapeptide radioligand, and provides information that should prove useful in the design of peptide radioligands having optimal properties.

Sustained voluntary alcohol drinking in rats has been associated with an upregulation of striatal DRD3 gene expression and selective blockade of DRD3 reduces ethanol preference, consumption, and cue-induced reinstatement. In vivo measurement of DRD3 in the living human brain has not been possible until recently owing to a lack of suitable tools. In this study, DRD3 status was assessed for the first time in human alcohol addiction. Brain DRD3 availability was compared between 16 male abstinent alcohol-dependent patients and 13 healthy non-dependent age-matched males using the DRD3-preferring agonist positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]PHNO with and without blockade with a selective DRD3 antagonist (GSK598809 60 mg p.o.). In striatal regions of interest, where the [C-11]PHNO PET signal represents primarily DRD2 binding, no differences were seen in [C-11]PHNO binding between the groups at baseline. However, baseline [C-11]PHNO binding was higher in alcohol-dependent patients in hypothalamus (VT: 16.5 +/- 4 vs 13.7 +/- 2.9, p = 0.040), a region in which the [C-11]PHNO signal almost entirely reflects DRD3 availability. The reductions in regional receptor binding (VT) following a single oral dose of GSK598809 (60 mg) were consistent with those observed in previous studies across all regions. There were no differences in regional changes in VT following DRD3 blockade between the two groups, indicating that the regional fractions of DRD3 are similar in the two groups, and the increased [C-11]PHNO binding in the hypothalamus in alcohol-dependent patients is explained by elevated DRD3 in this group. Although we found no difference between alcohol-dependent patients and controls in striatal DRD3 levels, increased DRD3 binding in the hypothalamus of alcohol-dependent patients was observed. This may be relevant to the development of future therapeutic strategies to treat alcohol abuse. 14	[Erritzoe, David; Bargiela, David; Colasanti, Alessandro; Nutt, David J.; Lingford-Hughes, Anne] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Div Brain Sci, Ctr Neuropsychopharmacol, London W12 0NN, England; [Tziortzi, Andri; Colasanti, Alessandro; Searle, Graham E.; Gunn, Roger N.; Beaver, John D.; Rabiner, Eugenii A.] GlaxoSmithKline, Clin Imaging Ctr, London, England; [Tziortzi, Andri] Univ Oxford, Dept Clin Neurol, FMRIB Ctr, Oxford, England; [Gunn, Roger N.] Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Dept Med, Div Brain Sci, London W12 0NN, England; [Waldmans, Adam] Charing Cross Hosp, Dept Imaging, London, England; [Bani, Massimo; Merlo-Pich, Emilio] GlaxoSmithKline, CEDD Neurosci, Verona, Italy	Imperial College London; GlaxoSmithKline; University of Oxford; Imperial College London; Imperial College London; GlaxoSmithKline	Erritzoe, D (corresponding author), Univ London Imperial Coll Sci Technol & Med, Fac Med, Div Brain Sci, Ctr Neuropsychopharmacol, Burlington Danes Bldg,Hammersmith Campus,160 Cane, London W12 0NN, England.	d.erritzoe@imperial.ac.uk	/AGR-6509-2022; Rabiner, Eugenii A./G-6263-2012; Gunn, Roger/H-1666-2012	/0000-0003-1953-6916; Rabiner, Eugenii A./0000-0003-3612-6687; Gunn, Roger/0000-0003-1181-5769; Waldman, Adam D/0000-0003-4398-6431; bani, massimo/0000-0002-7295-6103; Colasanti, Alessandro/0000-0001-6017-801X; Lingford-Hughes, Anne/0000-0003-4512-3453; Erritzoe, David/0000-0002-7022-6211	Medical Research Council [G0802723, G1002226] Funding Source: Medline; Wellcome Trust Funding Source: Medline; MRC [G0802723, G1002226] Funding Source: UKRI; Medical Research Council [G1002226, G0802723] Funding Source: researchfish; National Institute for Health Research [ACF-2013-21-501] Funding Source: researchfish	Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Wellcome Trust(Wellcome Trust); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); National Institute for Health Research(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))			71	44	49	0	4	NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP	LONDON	MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND	0893-133X	1740-634X		NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOL	Neuropsychopharmacology	JUN	2014	39	7					1703	1712		10.1038/npp.2014.18	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npp.2014.18			10	Neurosciences; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Neurosciences & Neurology; Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Psychiatry	AH4OG	24469594	Green Published, Bronze			2024-02-16	WOS:000336107300016

Here we present the results of a first-inhuman study assessing the safety and effectiveness of a novel PET radiopharmaceutical, F-18-3-fluoro-5-[(pyridin-3-yl)ethynyl]benzonitrile (F-18-FPEB), for quantifying regional brain concentrations of mGluR5. Methods: Quantification of whole-body biokinetics was conducted in 6 healthy adults (3 men and 3 women). The radiation safety profile was estimated with OLINDA/EXM software. Subsequently, pairs of dynamic brain scans were obtained for 11 healthy men to identify optimal methods for derivation of regional distribution volume and binding potential and to determine the repeatability of measurement. Results: The whole-body effective radiation dose was approximately 17 mu Sv/MBq (62 mrem/mCi), with the gallbladder receiving the highest dose of 190 mSv/MBq. In brain studies, time-activity curves showed high accumulation in the insula/caudate nucleus, moderate uptake in the thalamus, and the lowest concentration in the cerebellum/pons. The plasma reference graphical analysis method appeared optimal for F-18-FPEB; it showed acceptable test-retest variability of non-displaceable binding potential (<10%) and identified the highest nondisplaceable binding potential values (from similar to 0.5 in the globus pallidus to similar to 3.5 in the insula) for target regions. Safety assessments revealed no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, electrocardiogram, or laboratory values. Conclusion: F-18-FPEB is safe and well tolerated, and its regional cerebral distribution is consistent with previous reports in the literature for metabotropic glutamate receptors. The repeatability of measurement suggests that F-18-FPEB is suitable for quantifying mGluR5 in humans.

Synthesis and preclinical evaluation of a folic acid derivative labeled with <SUP>18</SUP>F for PET imaging of folate receptor-positive tumors	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						folate receptor; F-18 labeling; PET; tumor imaging	HUMAN KB-CELLS; BINDING PROTEIN; OVARIAN-CANCER; HIDAC-PET; DELIVERY; CAMERA; MICE	Folic acid was linked regioselectively through its alpha- and gamma-carboxyl groups to 4-fluorobenzylamine (FBA), and the mu and gamma-FBA-folate regioisomers were evaluated for their ability to bind to folate receptor-positive cells. The F-18-labeled alpha/gamma-FBA-folate counterpart was examined for in vivo tumor targeting efficiency in nude mice bearing folate receptor-positive tumor cells. Methods: F-18-alpha/gamma-FBA-folate was prepared in a 4-step reaction sequence starting from folic acid. The relative binding affinities of the a- and gamma-FBA-folates to the folate receptor with respect to parent folic acid were determined in cultured KB-31 cells (nasopharyngeal epidermal carcinoma cell line) overexpressing the folate receptor using H-3-folic acid. Tumor accumulation of the F-18-labeled alpha/gamma-FBA-folate and F-18-FDG was analyzed in vivo by high-resolution PET. Biodistribution and PET studies were performed under baseline and blockage conditions. Results: The radiochemical yield of the coupling step ranged from 15% to 44%, and the maximum specific radioactivity was 24 GBq/mu mol. The in vitro binding affinities of the alpha- and gamma-isomers and folic acid were 71, 62, and 41 nmol/L, respectively. PET revealed heterogeneous uptake of the radioligand, with the highest activity concentrations found in the tumor rim. In contrast, 18F-FDG uptake in a nude mouse bearing KB-31 folate receptor-positive tumors was negligible. Radioligand uptake in tumors at 125 min after injection amounted to 6.56% of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) in control animals, whereas radioactivity accumulation in the tumors of folic acid-treated animals was significantly reduced by more than 80%-to 1.07 %ID/g (P = 0.001). Conclusion: This new F-18-labeled folic acid derivative is a promising tool for PET imaging of folate receptor-positive tumors.

J	Wilson, CN; Batra, VK				Wilson, CN; Batra, VK			Lipopolysaccharide binds to and activates A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptors on human pulmonary artery endothelial cells	JOURNAL OF ENDOTOXIN RESEARCH			English	Article							NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; BACTERIAL LIPOPOLYSACCHARIDE; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; ENDOTOXIN INJURY; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; VASCULAR BED; LUNG INJURY; IN-VIVO; MACROPHAGES; EXPRESSION	Previously, it was reported that A(1) adenosine receptor antagonists prevent endotoxin-induced acute lung injury and pulmonary arterial endothelial cell damage. In competition radioligand binding experiments in membranes prepared from human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs), lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa displaced the binding of a selective A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist [I-125]-BWA844U (IC50 values: 195 ng/ml, 290 ng/ml, 602 ng/ml, and 693 ng/ml, respectively) in a dose-dependent, competitive manner. There was no displacement of this radioligand by enterotoxin (less than or equal to 10 mug/ml), diphosphoryl lipid A (less than or equal to 10 mug/ml), and glycolipids, monosialoganglioside (less than or equal to 10 mug/ml), lactocerebroside (less than or equal to 100 mug/ml), or NBD galactocerebroside (less than or equal to 100 mug/ml). Based on calculated IC50 values, LPS (E. coli, IC50 111 ng/ml) displaced the selective A(1) adenosine receptor agonist, [H-3]-2-chloro, N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) in human PAECs with a potency profile, CCPA > LPS > 2-phenylaminoadenosine (CV 1808), a selective A(2) adenosine receptor agonist. The potency profile for displacement of the selective A(2a) adenosine receptor agonist [H-3]-CGS 21680 was CV 1808 > CCPA. LPS (E. coli 0.1 pg/ml-10 mug/ml) did not displace [H-3]-CGS 21680 binding. In human PAECs, IL-6 and TXA(2) release induced by LPS (0-1 mug/ml) or CCPA (0-1 muM) at high doses was significantly reduced by the selective A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX; 1 muM). These data suggest that LPS binds to and activates A(1) adenosine receptors on human PAECs to induce the release of IL-6 and TXA(2). Activation of A(1) adenosine receptors on human PAECs by LPS, may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute lung injury associated with Gram-negative septicemia and endotoxemia.

Earlier observations concerning the light dependence of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade by nitroprusside prompted us to examine the effects of this iron complex on the NMDA receptor. [(FeH2O)-H-II(CN)(5)](3-) and two other related species, aminopentacyanoferrate(II) and aminopentacyanoferrate(III), were found to be highly potent, competitive, and selective NMDA receptor antagonists. In a binding assay for the transmitter recognition site on the NMDA receptor, these iron complexes displaced the radioligand [H-3]CGP 39653 with nanomolar affinities. They did not displace radioligands labeling the channel ([H-3]MK-801) or the glycine co-agonist ([H-3]glycine) sites of the NMDA receptor, nor did they have any relevant affinities for a number of other neurotransmitter (alpha -adrenergic, 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, opiate) receptors. The iron complexes blocked NMDA-induced depolarizations in rat cortical slices at submicromolar concentrations. whereas responses to alpha -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and kainate were not affected. In another functional receptor assay (potentiation of [H-3]MK-801 binding by glutamate under non-equilibrium conditions), Schild analysis demonstrated the competitive nature of the NMDA receptor antagonism. The pA(2) values obtained from these experiments were similar to the pK(i) values derived from radioligand ([H-3]CGP 39653) binding assays. To explain the high affinity and selectivity of these compounds for the NMDA receptor, a novel mechanism of antagonist-receptor interaction is proposed, involving a ligand exchange process in which a loosely bound species there H2O or NH3) in the coordination sphere of the iron complex is replaced by a functional group of an amino acid side chain placed at the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA receptor, thereby hindering agonist binding.

Prostate cancer in older men Special features of the diagnostics and treatment	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GERONTOLOGIE UND GERIATRIE			German	Article						Urologic oncology; Cancer treatment; Side effects; Quality of life; Geriatric assessment	RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; ELDERLY-PATIENTS; OUTCOMES; SURVIVAL; HORMONE; AGE	Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer in men. For localized prostate cancer, surgery and radiotherapy are the standard treatment, with active surveillance also used in low-risk cases. For advanced/metastatic disease, androgen deprivation treatment is carried out. Further options include inhibitors of the androgen receptor axis and taxane-based chemotherapy. The avoidance of side effects should be considered, e.g., by dose adjustment. New options include poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, and radioligand treatment. The existing guidelines only provide a few treatment recommendations for older patients; however, the treatment of older patients should primarily consider not only chronological age but also the patient's psychological and physical condition and preferences. In this context, the geriatric assessment represents an important instrument for determining the treatment strategy.

Exploration of Diazaspiro Cores as Piperazine Bioisosteres in the Development of σ2 Receptor Ligands	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						sigma-2 receptors; TMEM97; diazaspiro cores; bioisosteres	ADDITIVE FORCE-FIELD; SUBNANOMOLAR AFFINITY; DOPAMINE D-3; BINDING-SITE; GUI; PREFERENCE; ANALOGS; PROTEIN; SERVER	A series of sigma 2R compounds containing benzimidazolone and diazacycloalkane cores was synthesized and evaluated in radioligand binding assays. Replacing the piperazine moiety in a lead compound with diazaspiroalkanes and the fused octahydropyrrolo[3,4-b] pyrrole ring system resulted in a loss in affinity for the sigma 2R. On the other hand, the bridged 2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, 1,4-diazepine, and a 3-aminoazetidine analog possessed nanomolar affinities for the sigma 2R. Computational chemistry studies were also conducted with the recently published crystal structure of the sigma 2R/TMEM97 and revealed that hydrogen bond interactions with ASP29 and pi-stacking interactions with TYR150 were largely responsible for the high binding affinity of small molecules to this protein.

The method was found to afford moderate to high radiochemical yields of labelled rhenium(i) complexes. Subsequent thermal dissociation of the complexes enabled the radiosynthesis of fluorine-18 labelled pyridine bidentate structures which could not be radiofluorinated hitherto. This rhenium(i) complexation-dissociation strategy was further applied to the radiosynthesis of [F-18]CABS13, an Alzheimer's disease imaging agent, alongside other 2,2 '-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline and 8-hydroxyquinoline labelled radiotracers. Computational modelling of the reaction mechanism suggests that the efficiency of rhenium(i) activation may be attributed to both an electron withdrawal effect by the metal center and the formation of an acyl fluoride intermediate which anchors the fluoride subsequent to nucleophilic addition.

A novel one-pot palladium-mediated synthesis of <i>N</i>-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-<i>N</i>-(4-phenoxy-3-pyridinyl) acetamide, the precursor to [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28, a PET biomarker for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor	TETRAHEDRON LETTERS			English	Article						[C-11]PBR28; Positron emission tomography; Radiopharmaceutical synthesis	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PROTEIN 18 KDA; IN-VIVO; STANNOUS CHLORIDE; HUMAN BRAIN; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; C-11; RADIOSYNTHESIS; TOXICITY	Due to an urgent need to image the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) in living human subjects using positron emission tomography imaging, we had cause to prepare N-[(2-hydroxyphenyl)methyl]-N-(4-phenoxy-3-pyridinyl) acetamide (desmethyl-PBR28 (1)), the precursor to [C-11]PBR28. Herein, we report a new synthesis of the precursor in which palladium-mediated reduction of the nitro pyridine to the corresponding amino pyridine, and subsequent reductive amination, can be achieved with decaborane in a convenient one-pot procedure. This procedure is operationally simpler than the current alternatives and provides high quality precursor suitable for use in clinical applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This procedure yields up to 96% of radiochemical purity and higher radiolabeling efficiency. The preparation has been found to be sufficiently stable in vitro. Binding assay with human activated platelets indicated that Tc-99m-Annexin B1 retained its PS binding activity. Biodistribution in mice revealed that Tc-99m-Annexin B1 rapidly cleared from the blood and predominantly accumulated in the kidney. The increase in hepatic uptake in anti-Fas antibody treated mice correlated to histologic evidence of fulminant hepatic apoptosis. These data suggest that Tc-99m-Annexin B1 can be used as a novel radiotracer to detect apoptosis in vivo. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Both radioligands showed similar brain distribution in mice with relatively higher affinity for the hippocampus being rich in 5-HT1A receptors than for other brain regions. Uptake of [C-11](S)-PPMMB was not reduced by carrier-loading nor by pretreatment with 5-HT1A receptor ligands. [C-11](S)-PPMMB is therefore not a suitable radioligand for mapping 5-HT1A receptors using positron emission tomography. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Y, receptor mRNA is discretely distributed in the brain, including specific subregions of the hippocampus and the hypothalamus, and is largely consistent with the distribution of Y, receptor protein demonstrated by radioligand-binding methods. Y, receptor-mediated effects have been reported principally based on the observations using the C-terminal fragments of NPY. Recent studies indicate an involvement of the receptor in food intake, gastrointestinal motility, cardiovascular regulation, and neuronal excitability. Very recently, Y2 receptor selective antagonist has been developed and Y, receptor-deficient animals have been created. These new pharmacological tools will help to clarify the roles of this receptor in brain functions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Here we introduce a universal homogeneous kinetic probe competition assay (kPCA) that meets these requirements. The time-resolved fluorescence energy transfer (TR-FRET) procedure combines the versatility of radioligand binding assays with the advantages of homogeneous nonradioactive techniques while approaching the time resolution of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and related biosensors. We show application of kPCA for three important target classes: enzymes, protein-protein interactions, and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This method is capable of supporting early stages of drug discovery with large amounts of kinetic information. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Curious about Pesticide Action	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						binding site; fungicide; herbicide; insecticide; metabolism; mode of action; photoaffinity ligand; radioligand		The safe and effective use of pesticides requires knowledge of their mode of action in pests and adverse effects in nontarget organisms coupled with an understanding of their metabolic activation and detoxification. The author and his laboratory colleagues were privileged to observe, participate in, and sometimes influence these developments for the past six decades. This review considers contributions of the Berkeley and Madison laboratories to understanding insecticides acting at voltage-gated sodium and GABA-gated chloride channels and the nicotinic receptor and at serine hydrolases and other targets as well as the action of insecticide synergists and selected herbicides and fungicides. Some of the discoveries gave new probes, radioligands, photoaffinity labeling reagents, and understanding of reactive intermediates that changed the course of pesticide investigations and related areas of science. The importance of coupling mode of action with metabolism and design with serendipity is illustrated with a wide variety of chemotypes.

However, the neurochemical basis for these neuro psychiatric behaviours is at present unclear. In this study, we measured serotonin transporters, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT4 receptors using radioligand binding assays in the postmortem temporal cortex of a cohort of controls and AD patients longitudinally assessed for hyperphagia. We found significant decreases in 5-HT4 receptor densities in the hyperphagic, but not normophagic, AD group. Our data suggest that 5-HT4 receptor deficits may be a specific neurochemical correlate of hyperphagia, and point to the potential pharmacotherapeutic utility of 5-HT4 agonists for these behaviours; in AD.

They were tested in radioligand binding experiments to evaluate their affinity for 5-HTIA and 5-HT2A serotonergic, (X1 adrenergic, D1, and D2 doparninergic receptors. Many of tested compounds showed an interesting binding profile; in particular, 36 displayed very high 5-HTIA receptor affinity and selectivity over all the other investigated receptors. Selected compounds, evaluated in functional assays, showed antagonistic or partial agonistic activity at 5-HT1A receptor. An extensive conformational research using both NMR and modeling techniques indicated that extended conformations predominated in vacuum, in solution and during interactions with 5-HTIA receptor. Finally, the elaborated binding mode of selected compounds at 5-HTIA receptor was used to explain the influence of spacer length on ligands affinity.

Concise and comprehensive theoretical bases for such investigations as well as definite practical recommendations for experimental design and performance are given. We cover here questions concerning methodology for the determination of basic characteristics of the interaction between low-molecular weight ligands and their receptors: specific (nonspecific) binding, type of interaction, affinity constants, receptor quantity, and ligand specificity. Numerous examples of theoretical relationships and experimental results are clearly illustrated by a number of graphics. The lecture is intended not only for the experts directly engaged in the research of molecular aspects of hormone perception and signaling, but also for a wide range of readers interested in the topic of hormonal regulation in eukaryotes.

Radioligand displacement studies comprising the dopamine receptor subtypes D-1, D-2long D-2short, D-3, and D-4.4 were performed when the diazepinoindole 6 revealed D-1 and D-4 affinities (K-i = 0.11 mu M and 1.7 mu M, respectively) which are comparable to the partial D-1 agonist SKF 38393 (3b). In contrast to the benzazepine 3b, the indole based test compounds turned out less selective over the D-2 and D-3 receptor subtype.

Characterization of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Lu AE92686 as a PET radioligand for phosphodiesterase 10A in the nonhuman primate brain	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						[C-11] Lu AE92686; Monkey; MP-10; Phosphodiesterase 10A; PET; Substantia nigra	IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; INITIAL-CHARACTERIZATION; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; PDE10A; TRACER; RECEPTOR; QUANTIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA	[C-11]Lu AE92686 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand that has recently been validated for examining phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) in the human striatum. [C-11]Lu AE92686 has high affinity for PDE10A (IC (50) = 0.39 nM) and may also be suitable for examination of the substantia nigra, a region with low density of PDE10A. Here, we report characterization of regional [C-11]Lu AE92686 binding to PDE10A in the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain. A total of 11 PET measurements, seven baseline and four following pretreatment with unlabeled Lu AE92686 or the structurally unrelated PDE10A inhibitor MP-10, were performed in five NHPs using a high resolution research tomograph (HRRT). [C-11]Lu AE92686 binding was quantified using a radiometabolite-corrected arterial input function and compartmental and graphical modeling approaches. Regional time-activity curves were best described with the two-tissue compartment model (2TCM). However, the distribution volume (V (T)) values for all regions were obtained by the Logan plot analysis, as reliable cerebellar V (T) values could not be derived by the 2TCM. For cerebellum, a proposed reference region, V (T) values increased by similar to 30 % with increasing PET measurement duration from 63 to 123 min, while V (T) values in target regions remained stable. Both pretreatment drugs significantly decreased [C-11]Lu AE92686 binding in target regions, while no significant effect on cerebellum was observed. Binding potential (BP (ND)) values, derived with the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), were 13-17 in putamen and 3-5 in substantia nigra and correlated well to values from the Logan plot analysis. The method proposed for quantification of [C-11]Lu AE92686 binding in applied studies in NHP is based on 63 min PET data and SRTM with cerebellum as a reference region. The study supports that [C-11]Lu AE92686 can be used for PET examinations of PDE10A binding also in substantia nigra.

By modifying the receptor conformation, they change the affinity and/or efficacy of agonists, but often have no intrinsic activity on their own. Because of this use-dependent mechanism, they are expected to have a much better side-effect profile than agonist drugs. The first positive GABA type B (GABA(B)) receptor modulators, CGP7930 and GS39783, have been described more than 10 years ago. They were discovered in a high-throughput screen using GTP(gamma)S-35 assays, in which they enhanced both the affinity and the maximal effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), without having any agonist activity of their own. This positive modulation was subsequently confirmed in a number of different radioligand binding, biochemical and electrophysiological assay systems. The recombinant expression of engineered receptor constructs allowed to locate the site of action of these positive modulators to the seven-transmembrane domain of the GABA(B2) subunit, through which they could to some extent directly activate the receptor in sufficiently sensitive assay systems. These early findings have fostered the search for other molecules acting in a similar way, and a number of positive GABA(B) receptor modulators, and also the first negative modulators, have been described in recent years. In vivo microdialysis experiments have demonstrated at the biochemical level that the mechanism of positive allosteric GABA(B) receptor modulation also applies in living animals. Behavioural experiments have confirmed that positive GABA(B) receptor modulators have a better side-effect profile than the therapeutically used agonist drug baclofen. Numerous studies have shown that these compounds show promising activity in animal models for anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, pain, gastrointestinal indications and possibly more.

In Vivo Assessment of Brain White Matter Inflammation in Multiple Sclerosis with <SUP>18</SUP>F-PBR111 PET	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						multiple sclerosis; TSPO; microglia; lesion; PET; MTR	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MICROGLIA ACTIVATION; BINDING; DISEASE; MRI; HETEROGENEITY; PATHOGENESIS; EXPRESSION	PET radioligand binding to the 18-kD translocator protein (TSPO) in the brains of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) primarily reflects activated microglia and macrophages. We previously developed genetic stratification for accurate quantitative estimation of TSPO using second-generation PET radioligands. In this study, we used F-18-PBR111 PET and MR imaging to measure relative binding in the lesional, perilesional, and surrounding normal-appearing white matter of MS patients, as an index of the innate immune response. Methods: F-18-PBR111 binding was quantified in 11 MS patients and 11 age-matched healthy volunteers, stratified according to the rs6971 TSPO gene polymorphism. Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) MR imaging were used to segment the white matter in MS patients as lesions, perilesional volumes,, nonlesional white matter with reduced MTR, and nonlesional white matter with normal MTR. Results: F-18-PBR111 binding was higher in the white matter lesions and perilesional volumes of MS patients than in white matter of healthy controls (P < 0.05). Although there was substantial heterogeneity in binding between different lesions, a within-subject analysis showed higher F-18-PBR111 binding in MS lesions (P < 0.05) and in perilesional (P < 0.05) and nonlesional white matter with reduced MTR (P < 0.005) than in nonlesional white matter with a normal MTR. A positive correlation was observed between the mean F-18-PBR111 volume of distribution increase in lesions relative to nonlesional white matter with a normal MTR and the MS severity score (Spearman rho = 0.62, P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study demonstrates that quantitative TSPO PET with a second-generation radioligand can be used to characterize innate immune responses in MS in vivo and provides further evidence supporting an association between the white matter TSPO PET signal in lesions and disease severity. Our approach is practical for extension to studies of the role of the innate immune response in MS for differentiation of antiinflammatory effects of new medicines and their longer term impact on clinical outcome.

Liver membranes and total RNA were prepared from young (4- to 6-month-old) and old (24-month-old) male Fischer 344 rats. beta AR density (B-max) in liver membranes was measured by a radioligand receptor binding assay using the receptor subtype nonselective beta AR antagonist I-125-pindolol as the radioligand. Steady-state levels of beta(2)AR mRNA in rat liver were measured by Northern blot analysis; because of the low abundance of beta(1)AR and beta(3)AR mRNA in rat liver, the expressions of these genes were measured by a semiquantitative RT-PCR or an RT-PCR. Scatchard analysis of saturation binding curves of the binding assay confirmed an age-related increase in B-max (young: 7.1 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg protein vs. old: 18.1 +/- 4.3 fmol/mg protein). No age-related differences were found in the levels of beta(2)AR mRNA. However, semiquantitative RT-PCR revealed an approximately twofold increase in beta(1)AR mRNA level between young and old rats (P < 0.05). beta(1)AR mRNA levels were also correlated with B-max for I-125-pindolol binding sites in individual rats (r = 0.67; P = 0.012). beta(3)AR mRNA, which was demonstrable in rat white adipose tissue by RT-PCR, was generally not detected in livers from young or old rats, with the exception of two old rats with the highest B-max. These results suggest that an age-related increase of beta(1)AR gene expression contributes to increased beta AR density and beta adrenergic responsiveness in rat liver during aging.

Here we report on the distribution, displaceablity, specificity and modeling of [C-11]-(+)-PHNO and compare it with the well characterized antagonist D-2 radioligand, [C-11]raclopride, in cat. [C-11]-(+)-PHNO displayed high uptake in striatum with a mean striatal binding potential (BP) of 3.95 +/- 0.85. Pre-treatment with specific D-1 (SCH23390), D-2 (raclopride, haloperidol) and D-3 receptor (SB-277011) antagonists indicated that [C-11]-(+)-PHNO binding in striatum is specific to D-2 receptors. Within-subject comparisons showed that [C-11]-(+)-PHNO BP in striatum was almost 2.5-fold higher than that measured with [C-11]-(-)-NPA ([C-11]-(-)-N-propyl-norapomorphine). Comparison of the dose-effect of amphetamine (0.1, 0.5 and 2 mg/kg; i.v.) showed that [C-11]-(+)-PHNO was more sensitive to the dopamine releasing effect of amphetamine than [C-11]raclopride. Amphetamine induced up to 83 +/- 4% inhibition of [C-11]-(+)-PHNO BP and only up to 56 +/- 8% inhibition of [C-11]raclopride BP. Scatchard analyses of [C-11]-(+)-PHNO and [C-11]raclopride bindings in two cats showed that the B-max obtained with the agonist (29.6 and 32.9 pmol/mL) equalled that obtained with the antagonist (30.6 and 33.4 pmol/mL). The high penetration of [C-11]-(+)-PHNO in brain, its high signal-to-noise ratio, its favorable in vivo kinetics and its high sensitivity to amphetamine shows that [C-11]-(+)-PHNO has highly suitable characteristics for probing the D-2-high with PET.

Because this compound has highly favourable properties and potential as an antiobesity agent, new compounds of this general chemical class were sought that would retain or improve upon the high potency and selectivity of A-331440 for H-3 receptors, but would lack the potential for genotoxicity obtained with that compound. Our working hypothesis was that the biphenyl rings in A-331440 might contribute to interactions with DNA and thereby predispose toward genotoxicity. Toward this end, several analogues were prepared, with substituents introduced onto the biaryl ring to alter the orientation, electronegativity, and polarity of this moiety, and were tested for their radioligand binding potency and selectivity and their propensity to induce genotoxicity in the in vitro micronucleus assay. Using this strategy, novel compounds were discovered that retained or improved upon the potency and selectivity of A-331440 for H-3 receptors and were devoid of genotoxicity in vitro. Of these, the simple mono- and di-fluorinated analogues (A-417022 [4'-{3-[(3R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-pyrrolidinyl]propoxy}-3'-fluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-carbonitrile] and A-423579 [4'-{3-[(3R)-3-(dimethylamino)-1-pyrrolidinyl]-propoxy}-3',5'-difluoro-1,1'-biphenyl-4-carbonitrile], respectively) were found to bind to H-3 receptors at least as potently as A-331440, while lacking genotoxicity in the micronucleus assay. The reason of the lack of genotoxicity of the fluorinated analogues is unclear, but is especially noteworthy in light of the general principle that fluorine and hydrogen are very similar in size. Therefore, these fluorinated analogues of A-331440 represented the most potent and potentially safest compounds for further evaluation as antiobesity leads. Preliminary findings with one of these examples, A-417022, in a mouse model of obesity are presented.

Rat brain slices were incubated in a chamber with [C-11]raclopride in oxygenated medium at 34degreesC for 150 min. Two-dimensional images of radioactivity in the slices were recorded on a storage phosphor screen and dynamic changes were measured. When the brain slices were exposed to the depolarization agents (25 mM K+, 50 mM K+, and 20 muM veratridine), the percentage inhibition of striatal [C-11]raclopride-specific binding was 22 +/- 4%, 44 +/- 8% and 54 +/- 7% of the control, respectively. The percentage inhibition of [C-11]raclopride-specific binding during each depolarization treatment agreed proportionally with the amount of DA released into the medium. However, preexposure of brain slices to the same depolarization treatment (50 mM K+) did not affect the [C-11]raclopride-specific binding, suggesting that the reduction in receptor density and/or affinity was not involved in the decrease of [C-11]raclopride-specific binding. [C-11]Raclopride-specific binding decreased dose-dependently in the presence of exogenously added DA (range 0.005-3mM). The synaptic DA concentration during each depolarization treatment estimated using three different methods. These results suggest that the decrease of [C-11]raclopride-specific binding to striatal slices following evoked DA release is due to competition between endogenous DA and raclopride. It is unlikely that changes in D, receptor density or in affinity of the receptors for raclopride are involved. These results provide supportive evidence for in vivo binding competition between radioligand and endogenous neurotransmitter. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Sequence analysis revealed 1170 bp encoding an open reading frame of 390 amino acids showing a 95% similarity with the human 5-HT1B receptor. 2 The recombinant porcine 5-HT1B cDNA was expressed in monkey Cos-7 cells and its pharmacological profile was determined by radioligand binding assay using [H-3]-GR125743. The affinities of several agonists (L694247 > ergotamine greater than or equal to 5-carboxamidotryptamine = dihydroergotamine= 5-HT > CP122638 = zolmitriptan > sumatriptan) and putative antagonists (GR127935 > methiothepin > SB224289 > > ritanserin > ketanserin greater than or equal to BRL15572) correlated highly with those described for the recombinant human 5-HT1B receptor. 3 In membranes obtained from cells co-expressing the porcine 5-HT1B receptor and a mutant G(alphaO)Cys(351)Ile protein, 5-HT and zolmitriptan increased, while the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist SB224289 decreased basal [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding, thus showing inverse agonism. The potency of zolmitriptan in the [S-35]-GTP gammaS binding assay (pEC(50): 7.64 +/- 0.04) agreed with its affinity in displacing the antagonist [H-3]-GR125743 (pK(i): 7.36 +/- 0.07). 4 The 5-HT1B receptor mRNA was observed by RT-PCR in several blood vessels, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and trigeminal ganglion. In situ hybridization performed in frontal cerebral cortex sections revealed the expression of 5-HT1B receptor mRNA in pyramidal cells. 5 In conclusion, we have cloned and established the amino acid sequence, ligand binding profile and location of the porcine 5-HT1B receptor. This information may be useful in exploring the role of 5-HT1B receptor in pathophysiological processes relevant for novel drug discovery in diseases such as migraine.

These derivatives were produced by a Rap-Stoermer condensation reaction. Compounds with a N,N-dimethylamino group displayed high affinity for A beta(1-42) aggregates with K(i) values in the nanomolar range. Autoradiography with brain sections of AD model mice (APP/PS1) revealed that a radioiodinated probe, [(125)I]10, labeled beta-amyloid plaques selectively and displayed good brain uptake (3.53% ID/g) at 2 min. The results suggest that benzofuran-2-yl(phenyl) methanone derivatives should be investigated further as potential probes for detecting beta-amyloid plaques in the AD brain. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The study adopted 96-well microplate filtration assay format. The screening window factor (z') indicated that the assays were robust and suitable for medium throughput screening (MTS). Though none of the plant extracts tested show high receptor binding activity against GABA(B), dopamine (D2S), chemokine (CXCR2), chemotactic C5a-anaphylatoxin receptors, the initial screening indicated six plant extracts have 75 % or higher level of inhibition towards 5HT1a receptor.

A systematic modification of the tricyclic structures based on a xanthine core by enlargement of the third heterocyclic ring or attachment of various substituted benzyl moieties resulted in the development of 9-(2-chloro-6-fluorobenzyl)-1,3-dimethyl-6,7,8,9tetrahydropyrimido[ 2,1-f] purine-2,4(1H, 3H)-dione (9u; K-i human A(2A)AR: 189 nM and IC50 human MAO-B: 570 nM) as the most potent dual acting ligand of the series displaying high selectivity versus related targets. Moreover, some potent, selective MAO-B inhibitors were identified in the group of pyrimido-and 1,3-diazepino [2,1-f] purinediones. Compound 10d (10-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1,3-dimethyl-7,8,9,10-tetrahydro-1H-[1,3] diazepino[ 2,1-f] purine-2,4(3H, 6H)-dione) displayed an IC50 value at human MAO-B of 83 nM. Analysis of structure- activity relationships was complemented by molecular docking studies based on previously published X-ray structures of the protein targets. An extended biological profile was determined for selected compounds including in vitro evaluation of potential hepatotoxicity calculated in silico and antioxidant properties as an additional desirable activity. The new molecules acting as dual target drugs may provide symptomatic relief as well as disease-modifying effects for neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Parkinson's disease.

The direct effect of rimonabant on opioid receptors has been studied so far mainly on mu-opioid receptors. However recently the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) receives much more attention as before, due to its potential therapeutic applications, such as nociception or treatment for psychiatric disorders. Objectives: To investigate the direct effect of rimonabant on DOR specific ligand binding and on the DOR mediated G-protein activation. Results: Micromolar concentrations of rimonabant directly inhibited the DOR specific agonist binding in radioligand competition binding experiments using Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with mouse DOR (CHO-mDOR). However the inhibition occurred also in the subnanomolar range during DOR specific antagonist binding in similar experimental conditions. In functional [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays rimonabant significantly decreased the basal receptor activity in CHO-mDOR but also in parental CHO cell membranes. During DOR agonist stimulation, micromolar concentration of rimonabant attenuated the DOR G-protein activation and the potency of the activator ligand in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays performed in CHO-mDOR, in wild type and also in CB1/CB2 double knock-out mouse forebrain membranes. Yet again this inhibitory action was DOR specific, since it did not occur during other specific GPCR agonist mediated G-protein activation. Conclusion: Rimonabant directly inhibited DOR function in the micromolar concentrations. The inhibitory actions indicate an antagonistic behavior towards DOR which was established by the followings: (i) rimonabant inhibited DOR antagonist binding more effectively than agonist binding, (ii) the inverse agonistic, agonistic effect of the compound can be excluded, and (iii) additionally according to previous findings the allosteric mechanism can also be foreclosed.

[3 H] A-369508 binds with high affinity to the major human dopamine D-4 receptor variants D-4.2, D-4.4 and D-4.7 (K-d = 1.7, 4, and 1.2 nM, respectively). It also binds to the rat dopamine D4 receptor, (K-d=4.4 nM), implying similar binding affinity across human and rat receptors. A-369508 shows >400-fold selectivity over D-2L, >350-fold selectivity over 5-HT1A and >700-1000-fold selectivity over all other receptors tested. Agonist activity determined by inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human dopamine D-4.4 receptor (EC50=7.5 nM, intrinsic activity=0.71) indicates that A-369508 is a potent agonist at the human dopamine D-4 receptor. Similar data was observed in other functional assays. [H-3] A369508 binds to a single, high affinity site on membranes containing the human dopamine D-4.4 receptor. When compared to the D-2-like antagonist [H-3] spiperone, competition binding for agonists like dopamine and apomorphine were 2-10-fold more potent with [H-3] A369508, while the antagonists clozapine, haloperidol and L-745870 bind with similar affinity to both ligands. Binding to rat brain regions demonstrated that the most abundant area was cerebral cortex (51.2 fmol/mg protein) followed by hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. [H-3] A-369508 is a useful tool to define the localization and physiological role of dopamine D-4 receptors in central nervous system and can facilitate measuring accurate affinities (K-i) for structure/activity relationship studies designed to identify dopamine D-4 receptor selective agonists.

To minimize hypotensive and other side effects, compounds with selective antagonist activity at alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)- (compared with alpha(1B)-) adrenoceptors were evaluated that would block lower urinary tract alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in preference to cardiovascular alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors. Fiduxosin (3-[4-((3aR,9bR)-cis-9-methoxyl,2,3,3a,4,9b-hexahydro-[1]-benzopyrano[3,4-c]pyrrol-2-yl)butyl]8-phenyl-pyrazino[2',3':4,5] thieno-[3,2-d]pyrimidine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione; ABT-980) was tested in radioligand binding assays, isolated tissue bioassays, intraurethral pressure (IUP) tests in isoflurane-anesthetized dogs, and blood pressure analyses in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Fiduxosin had higher affinity for cloned human alpha(1a)- (0.16 nM) and alpha(1d)-adrenoceptors (0.92 nM) in radioligand binding studies compared with alpha(1b)-adrenoceptors (25 nM) or in isolated tissue bioassays [pA(2) values of 8.5-9.6 for alpha(1A)-receptors in rat vas deferens or canine prostate strips, 8.9 at alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors (rat aorta), compared with 7.1 at alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors (rat spleen)]. Furthermore, the compound antagonized putative alpha(1L)-adrenoceptors in the rabbit urethra (pA(2) value of 7.58). Fiduxosin blocked epinephrine-induced increases in canine IUP (pseudo-pA(2) value of 8.12), eliciting only transient decreases in mean arterial blood pressure(MAP) in SHR. The area under the curve (AUC(0-60) min) for the hypotensive response was dose related with a log index value for fiduxosin of 5.23, indicating a selectivity of 770-fold comparing IUP to MAP effects. Preferential antagonism of alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)- versus alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors in vitro, blockade of putative alpha(1L)-sites in vitro, and selective effects on lower urinary tract function versus blood pressure in vivo by fiduxosin suggest-the potential utility of this compound for the treatment of BPH.

To efficiently establish structure-activity relationships (SARs), new synthetic methodologies amenable for parallel synthesis were developed. The compounds were evaluated in a mammalian cell-based functional assay and in radioligand binding assays expressing recombinant human cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). In general, all of the compounds exhibited high binding selectivity at CB1 vs CB2 and the general SAR revealed a lead compound 11-(4-chlorophenyl)dibenzo[b,f] [1,4]thiazepine-8-carboxylic acid butylamide (12e) which showed excellent in vivo activity in pharmacodynamic models related to CB I receptor activity. The low solubility that hampered the development of 12e was solved leading to a potential preclinical candidate 11-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine-8-carboxylic acid butylamide (12h).

However, molecular and physiological alterations of the healthy brain during aging remain incompletely understood. Generalized synaptic restructuring may contribute to healthy aging and the reduced metabolism observed in the aged brain. The aim of this study was to assess healthy brain aging using [F-18]FDG as a measure of cerebral glucose con-sumption and [C-11]UCB-J PET as an indicator of synaptic density. Method: Using in vivo PET imaging and the novel synaptic-vesicle-glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [C-11]UCB-J alongside with the fluorodeoxyglucose radioligand [F-18]FDG, we obtained SUVR-1 values for 14 pre-defined volume-of-interest brain regions defined on MRI T1 scans. Regional differences in relative [F-18]FDG and [C-11] UCB-J uptake were investigated using a voxel-wise approach. Finally, correlations between [C-11]UCB-J, [F-18] FDG PET, and age were examined. Results: We found widespread cortical reduction of synaptic density in a cohort of older HC subjects (N = 15) compared with young HC subjects (N = 11). However, no reduction persisted after partial volume correction and corrections for multiple comparison. Our study confirms previously reported synaptic stability during aging. Regional differences in relative [F-18]FDG and [C-11]UCB-J uptake were observed with up to 20 % higher [C-11] UCB-J uptake in the amygdala and temporal lobe and up to 34 % higher glucose metabolism in thalamus, striatum, occipital, parietal and frontal cortex. Conclusion: In vivo PET using [C-11]UCB-J does not support declining synaptic density levels during aging. Thus, loss of synaptic density may be unrelated to aging and does not seem to be a sufficient explanation for the recognized reduction in brain metabolism during aging. Our study also demonstrates that the relationship be-tween glucose consumption and synaptic density is not uniform throughout the human brain with implications for our understanding of neuroenergetics.

Rational combination therapies may improve treatment efficacy. Here, we explored the effect of androgen receptor blockade (ARB) on PSMA expression visualized by PET and its potential additive effect when combined with Lu-177-PSMA RLT in a mouse model of prostate cancer.MethodsMice bearing human CRPC (C4-2 cells) xenografts were treated with 10mg/kg enzalutamide (ENZ), with 50mg/kg bicalutamide (BIC), or vehicle (control) for 21days. PSMA expression was evaluated by Ga-68-PSMA11 PET/CT and quantified by flow cytometry of tumor fine needle aspirations before treatment and on days 23, 29, 34, and 39 post-therapy induction. For the RLT combination approach, mice bearing C4-2 tumors were treated with 10mg/kg ENZ or vehicle for 21days before receiving either 15MBq (84GBq/mol) Lu-177-PSMA617 or vehicle. DNA damage was assessed as phospho-H2A.X foci in tumor biopsies. Reduction of tumor volume on CT and survival were used as study endpoints.ResultsTumor growth was delayed by ARB while Ga-68-PSMA11 uptake increased up to 2.3-fold over time when compared to controls. ABR-induced upregulation of PSMA expression was confirmed by flow cytometry. Phospho-H2A.X levels increased 1.8- and 3.4-fold at 48h in response to single treatment ENZ or RLT and ENZ+RLT, respectively. Despite significantly greater DNA damage and persistent increase of PSMA expression at the time of RLT, no additional tumor growth retardation was observed in the ENZ+RLT group (vs. RLT only, p=0.372 at day 81). Median survival did not improve significantly when ENZ was combined with RLT.ConclusionARB-mediated increases in PSMA expression in PC xenografts were evident by Ga-68-PSMA11 PET imaging and flow cytometry. Lu-177-PSMA617 effectively decreased C4-2 tumor size. However, while pre-treatment with ARB increased DNA damage significantly, it did not result in synergistic effects when combined with RLT.

We have previously identified LP1, a MOR/DOR multitarget opioid ligand, with an N-phenylpropanamido substituent linked to (-)-cis-N-Normetazocine scaffold. Herein, we report the synthesis, competition binding and calcium mobilization assays of new compounds 10-16 that differ from LP1 by the nature of the N-substituent. In radioligand binding experiments, the compounds 10-13, featured by an electron-withdrawing or electron-donating group in the para position of phenyl ring, displayed improved affinity for KOR (K-i = 0.85-4.80 M) in comparison to LP1 (7.5 M). On the contrary, their MOR and DOR affinities were worse (K-i = 0.18-0.28 M and K-i = 0.38-1.10 M, respectively) with respect to LP1 values (K-i = 0.049 and 0.033 M). Analogous trends was recorded for the compounds 14-16, featured by indoline, tetrahydroquinoline, and diphenylamine functionalities in the N-substituent. In calcium mobilization assays, the compound 10 with a p-fluorophenyl in the N-substituent shared the functional profile of LP1 (pEC(50)(MOR) = 7.01), although it was less active. Moreover, the p-methyl- (11) and p-cyano- (12) substituted compounds resulted in MOR partial agonists and DOR/KOR antagonists. By contrast, the derivatives 13-15 resulted as MOR antagonists, and the derivative 16 as a MOR/KOR antagonist (pK(B)(MOR) = 6.12 and pK(B)(KOR) = 6.11). Collectively, these data corroborated the critical role of the N-substituent in (-)-cis-N-Normetazocine scaffold. Thus, the new synthesized compounds could represent a template to achieve a specific agonist, antagonist, or mixed agonist/antagonist functional profile.

While significant progress has been made in PET imaging of A beta aggregates both in vitro and in vivo, options for imaging tau protein aggregates selectively are still limited. Based on the work previously published by researchers from the Tohoku University, Japan, that resulted in the development of [F-18]THK-5351, we have undertaken an effort to develop a carbon-11 version of the identical structure - [C-11]THK-5351. In parallel, THK-5351 was also labeled with tritium ([H-3]THK-5351) for use in in vitro autoradiography (ARG). Methods: The carbon -11 labeling was performed starting with di-protected enantiomeric pure precursor-tertbutyl 5-(6-( (2S)-3-fluoro-2-(tetrahydro-2H-Pyran-2-yloxy)proPoxy)quinolin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl carbamate, which was reacted with [C-11]MeI, using DMF as the solvent and NaH as base, followed by deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid/water mixture, resulting in enantiomerically pure carbon-11 radioligand,[C-11]THK-5351 (S)-1-fluoro-3-(2-(6-([C-11]methylamino)pyridin-3-yl)quinolin-6-yloxy)propan-2-ol. Tritium labeling and purification of [H-3]THK-5351 were undertaken using similar approach, resulting in [H-3]THK-5351 with RCP >99.8% and specific radioactivity of 13 GB q/mu mol. Results: [C-11]THK-5351 was produced in good yield (1900 +/- 355 MBq), specific radioactivity (SRA) (361 +/- 119 GBq/mu mol at EOS + 20 min) and radiochemical purity (RCP) (>99.8%), with enantiomeric purity of 98.7%. [H-3]TM-5351 was evaluated for ARG of tau binding in post-mortem human brain tissue using cortical sections from one AD patient and one control subject. [H-3]THK-5351 binding density was higher in the AD patient compared to the control subject, the binding was displaced by unlabeled THK-5351 confirming specific [H-3] THK-5351 binding.

We have previously reported two novel 5-HT4 receptor radioligands, namely [methoxy-C-11](1-butylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 4-amino-3-methoxybenzoate; [C-11]RX-1), and the [F-18]3-fluoromethoxy analog ([F-18]RX-2), and in this study we evaluated them by PET in rhesus monkey. Brain scans were performed at baseline, receptor preblock or displacement conditions using SB 207710, a 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, on the same day for [C-11]RX-1 and on different days for [F-18]RX-2. Specific-to-nondisplaceable ratio (BPND) was measured with the simplified reference tissue model from all baseline scans. To determine specific binding, total distribution volume (V-T) was also measured in some monkeys by radiometabolite-corrected arterial input function after ex vivo inhibition of esterases from baseline and blocked scans. Both radioligands showed moderate to high peak brain uptake of radioactivity (2-6 SUV). Regional BPND values were in the rank order of known 5-HT4 receptor distribution with a trend for higher BPND values from [F-18]RX-2. One-tissue compartmental model provided good fits with well identified V-T values for both radioligands. In the highest 5-HT4 receptor density region, striatum, 50-60% of total binding was specific. The V-T in receptor-poor cerebellum reached stable values by about 60 min for both radioligands indicating little influence of radiometabolites on brain signal. In conclusion, both [C-11]RX-1 and [F-18]RX-2 showed positive attributes for PET imaging of brain 5-HT4 receptors, validating the radioligand design strategy. Synapse 68:613-623, 2014.

GRP-receptor overexpression has been detected in endocrine-related cancer cells and, more recently, also in the vascular bed of selected tumors. More information on vascular GRP-receptors in cancer is required to asses their potential for vascular targeting applications Therefore, frequent human cancers (n=368) were analyzed using in vitro G R P-receptor autoradiography on tissue sections with the I-125-[Tyr(4)]-bombesin radioligand and/or the universal radioligand I-125-[D-Tyr(6), beta-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]-bombesin(6-14). GRP-receptor expressing vessels were evaluated in each tumor group for prevalence, quantity (vascular score), and GRP-receptor density. Prevalence of vascular GRP-receptors was variable, ranging from 12% (prostate cancer) to 92% (urinary tract cancer). Different tumor types within a given site had divergent prevalence of vascular GRP-receptors (e g lung: small cell cancer: 0%, adenocarcinoma. 59%; squamous carcinoma: 83%). Also the vascular score varied widely, with the highest score in urinary tract cancer (1.69), moderate scores in lung (0.91), colon (0.88), kidney (0.84), and biliary tract (0.69) cancers and low scores in breast (0.39) and prostate (0.14) cancers. Vascular GRP-receptors were expressed in the muscular vessel wall in moderate to high densities Normal non-neoplastic control tissues from these organs lacked vascular GRP-receptors. In conclusion, tumoral vessels in all evaluated sites express GRP-receptors, suggesting a major biological function of GRP-receptors in neovasculature. Vascular GRP-receptor expression varies between the tumor types indicating tumor-specific mechanisms in their regulation. Urinary tract cancers express vascular GRP-receptors so abundantly, that they are promising candidates for vascular targeting applications.

Using this tritiated ligand the 2 alpha-1 adrenoceptors were examined in binding studies with intact tissue segments and membrane preparations of human prostate, and compared with functionally identified alpha-1 adrenoceptor. Materials and Methods: Binding assays with tissue segments and membrane preparations of human prostate samples were performed using [H-3]-silodosin and binding affinities for various drugs were estimated. In functional experiments antagonist. affinities were evaluated from the inhibitory potency against the contractile response to noradrenaline. Results: [H-3]-silodosin bound to intact segments and membrane preparations of human prostate with subnanomolar affinity. [H-3]-silodosin binding sites in intact segments were divided into 2 distinct components with different affinities for prazosin and RS-17053 (N-[2(2-cyclopropylmethoxyphenoxy)ethyl]-5-chloro-alpha, alpha-dimethyl1H-indole-3-ethanamine hydrochloride) (Research Biochemicals International, Natick, Massachusetts), while binding in membrane preparations showed single high affinity for these drugs. [H-3]-silodosin binding sites also showed high affinity for silodosin and tamsulosin but low sensitivity to BMS 7378 (8-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-8-azaspiro(4.5)decane-7,9-drone) (Research Biochemicals International) in intact. segments and in membrane preparations. In functional experiments silodosin and tamsulosin potently inhibited the contractile response to noradrenaline but prazosin, RS-17053 and BMY 7378 showed low antagonistic affinity. Conclusions: The current binding studies in human prostate samples clearly show that alpha-1L and alpha-1A adrenoceptors coexist as pharmacologically distinct entities in intact tissues but not in crude membrane preparations. Also, alpha-1 adrenoceptors involved in the contractile response to noradrenaline are the alpha-1L subtype.

To characterize the in vivo specific binding and pharmacokinetics of a 1,4-dihydropyridine (DHP) calcium channel antagonist, PN 200-110, in the senescent brain, using senescence-accelerated prone mice (SAMP8) and senescence-resistant mice (SAMR1). Methods. Blood, brain, and heart samples were taken periodically from SAMR1 and SAMP8 following intravenous injection of (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110, and the concentration of (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110 in the plasma and tissues was determined. In addition, the in vivo specific binding of (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110 in the brains of SAMR1 and SAMP8 was measured periodically after intravenous injection of the radioligand. Results. There was very little significant difference between SAMR1 and SAMP8 in terms of the half-life (t(1/2)), total body clearance (CLtot), steady-state volume of distribution (Vd(ss)), and AUC for the plasma concentration of (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110 after intravenous injection of the radioligand. The brain concentration (AUC(brain)) for (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110 and the brain/plasma AUC ratio (AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma)) were significantly lower in SAMP8 than in SAMR1, and the heart concentration (AUC(heart)) and the heart/plasma AUC ratio (AUC(heart)/AUC(plasma)) were similar in both strains. Also, the brain/plasma unbound AUC ratio (AUC(brain)/AUC(plasma-free)) for (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110 was significantly lower in SAMP8 than in SAMR1. The in vivo specific binding (AUC(specific binding), maximal number of binding sites: B-max) of (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110 was significantly lower in brain particulate fractions of SAMP8 than SAMR1. Conclusions. The concentration and in vivo specific binding of (+)-[H-3]PN 200-110 was significantly reduced in the senescent brain. The simultaneous analysis of the concentrations of centrally acting drugs and the in vivo specific binding in the brain in relation to their pharmacokinetics may be valuable in evaluating their CNS effects.

Herein, we described a SPA assay developed to identify compounds that bind to human fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). This SPA assay utilizes the specific binding of [H-3]-R(+)-methanandamide (H-3-MAEA), a competitive nonhydrolyzed FAAH inhibitor, to FAAH expressing microsomes and evaluates its displacement by FAAH inhibitors. In contrast to the classical SPA radioligand binding assay which detects bound ligand, in our assay the released radiolabel is detected through its interaction with the SPA beads. This novel SPA assay has been validated and demonstrated to be simple, sensitive, and amenable to high-throughput screening.

The study subjects were scanned 0.3, 3, 6 and 23 h after injection of 185 MBq of [I-123]nor-beta -CIT. The ratio of the distribution volume for tracer in the midbrain to that in the cerebellum minus 1 was used as an index for serotonin transporter binding. An age-related decline of 2% per decade (r=-0.47; P <0.05) was found in the midbrain. The decline in [I-123]nor-beta -CIT binding in the serotonin transporter-rich area is much less than that in dopamine transporters in the striatum (6% per decade).

Homoibotenic acid analogues were investigated at recombinant GluR1(o), GluR2(o)(R), GluR3(o) and GluR1(o)+ 3(o) receptors expressed in Sf9 insect cells and affinities determined in [H-3]AMPA radioligand binding experiments. (S)-4-bromo-homoibotenic acid (BrHIBO) exhibited a 126-fold selectivity for GluR1(o) compared to GluR3(o). Xenopus laevis oocytes were used to express functional homomeric and heteromeric recombinant AMPA-R and to determine BrHIBO potency (EC50) at these channels. (R,S)-BrHIBO exhibited a 37-fold selectivity range amongst the AMPA-R. It is hoped that BrHIBO can be used as a lead structure for the development of other subtype-selective compounds.

Interobserver Agreement Rates on C-X-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 4-Directed Molecular Imaging and Therapy	CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						[Ga-68]pentixafor; C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4; CXCR4; interobserver; radioligand therapy; theranostics	4 EXPRESSION; CANCER; SOMATOSTATIN	BackgroundWe aimed to evaluate the interobserver agreement rates in patients scanned with C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4)-directed PET/CT, including the rate of patients eligible for CXCR4-targeted radioligand therapy (RLT) based on scan results.MethodsFour independent observers reviewed 50 CXCR4-targeted [Ga-68]pentixafor PET/CT of patients with various solid cancers. On a visual level, the following items were assessed by each reader: overall scan impression, number of organ and lymph node (LN) metastases and number of affected organs and LN regions. For a quantitative investigation, readers had to choose a maximum of 3 target lesions, defined as largest in size and/or most intense uptake per organ compartment. Reference tissues were also quantified, including unaffected hepatic parenchyma and blood pool. Last, all observers had to decide whether patients were eligible for CXCR4-targeted RLT. Concordance rates were tested using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). For interpretation, we applied the definition of Cicchetti (with 0.4-0.59 indicating fair; 0.6-0.74, good; 0.75-1, excellent agreement).ResultsOn a visual level, fair agreement was achieved for an overall scan impression (ICC, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.45-0.71). Organ and LN involvement (ICC, >= 0.4) demonstrated fair, whereas CXCR4 density and number of LN and organ metastases showed good agreement rates (ICC, >= 0.65). Number of affected organs and affected LN areas, however, showed excellent concordance (ICC, >= 0.76). Quantification in LN and organ lesions also provided excellent agreement rates (ICC, >= 0.92), whereas quantified uptake in reference organs provided fair concordance (ICC, >= 0.54). Again, excellent agreement rates were observed when deciding on patients eligible for CXCR4-RLT (ICC, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.85-0.95).ConclusionsIn patients scanned with CXCR4-targeted PET/CT, we observed fair to excellent agreement rates for both molecular imaging and therapy parameters, thereby favoring a more widespread adoption of [Ga-68]pentixafor in the clinic.

HIV-infected glial cells release cytokines and chemokines that, along with viral neurotoxins, contribute to neuronal damage and apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if glial cell activation in HIV-positive (HIV+) patients could be detected noninvasively, in vivo, using [C-11]-R-PK11195 with positron emission tomography ( PET). [C-11]-R-PK11195 is a selective radioligand for the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), and is known to reflect the extent of glial cell activation. A subaim was to determine if nondemented HIV+ patients could be distinguished from those with HIV-associated dementia (HAD) on the basis of [C-11]-R-PK11195 binding. Five healthy volunteers and 10 HIV+ patients underwent PET with [C-11]-R-PK11195. Time-radioactivity curves (TACs) were generated from dynamic PET images in nine regions of interest (ROIs) drawn on coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The average radioactivity was calculated in each ROI and was normalized to the average radioactivity in white matter. Patients with HAD showed significantly higher [C-11]-R-PK11195 binding than controls in five out of eight brain regions ( P <.05, Mann-Whitney U test). Nondemented HIV+ patients did not show significantly increased binding compared to controls. HIV+ patients overall ( demented and nondemented) showed significantly higher radioligand binding than controls in five brain regions ( P < 0.05). Patients with HAD did not show significant differences in binding when compared to HIV+ nondemented patients. The findings of this pilot study support a role for glial cell activation in HAD, and that PET with [C-11]-R-PK11195 can detect the concomitants of neuronal damage in individuals infected with HIV.

We address the following topics in this study: ( a) the relationship between withdrawal time of lead exposure and brain beta-adrenergic receptor, blood lead level, and brain lead level in lead-exposed rats after lead exposure was stopped; and (b) the relationship between lead level and beta-adrenergic receptor and cyclic AMP (c-AMP) in brain. Wistar rats were chronically fed with 2% lead acetate and water for 2 months. Radioligand binding was assayed by a method that fulfilled strict criteria of beta-adrenergic receptor using the ligand [I-125] iodocyanopindolol. The levels of lead were determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The c-AMP level was determined by radioimmunoassay. The results showed a close relationship between decreasing lead levels and increasing numbers of brain beta-adrenergic receptors and brain adenylate cyclase activity after system of brain after lead exposure was withdrawn. We address the following topics in this study: ( a) the relationship between withdrawal time of lead exposure and brain beta-adrenergic receptor, blood lead level, and brain lead level in lead-exposed rats after lead exposure was stopped; and (b) the relationship between lead level and beta-adrenergic receptor and cyclic AMP (c-AMP) in brain. Wistar rats were chronically fed with 2% lead acetate and water for 2 months. Radioligand binding was assayed by a method that fulfilled strict criteria of beta-adrenergic receptor using the ligand [ 125 I] iodocyanopindolol. The levels of lead were determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The c-AMP level was determined by radioimmunoassay. The results showed a close relationship between decreasing lead levels and increasing numbers of brain beta-adrenergic receptors and brain adenylate cyclase activity after lead exposure was withdrawn. The effect of lead exposure on the beta-adrenergic system of the brain is a partly reversible condition.

Quantification by protein staining and with a radioligand binding assay using the high-affinity P2Y(1)-R antagonist [H-3] MRS2279 ([H-3] 2-chloro-N-6-methyl-(N)-methanocarba-2'-deoxyadenosine 3',5'-bis-phosphate) indicated a nearly homogenous preparation of receptor protein. K-i values determined in [H-3] MRS2279 binding assays for antagonists with the purified P2Y(1)-R were in good agreement with the K-i and K-B values determined for these molecules in membrane binding and activity assays, respectively. Availability of P2Y(1)-R in purified form allowed direct determination of nucleotide agonist affinities under conditions not compromised by nucleotide metabolism/interconversion, and an order of affinities of 2-methylthio-ADP (2MeSADP) > ADP = 2-methylthio-ATP = adenosine-5'-O-(3-thio) triphosphate = adenosine-5'-O( 2-thiodiphosphate) >> ATP was obtained. The signaling activity of the purified P2Y(1)-R was quantified after reconstitution in proteoliposomes with heterotrimeric G proteins. Steady-state GTP hydrolysis in vesicles reconstituted with P2Y(1)-R and Galpha(q)beta(1)gamma(2) was stimulated by the addition of either 2MeADP or RGS4 alone and was increased by up to 50-fold in their combined presence. EC50 values of agonists for activation of the purified P2Y(1)-R were similar to their respective K-i values determined in radioligand binding experiments with the purified receptor. Moreover, ATP exhibited 20-fold higher EC50 and K-i values than did ADP and was a partial agonist relative to ADP and 2MeSADP under conditions in which no metabolism of the nucleotide occurred. Both RGS4 and PLC-beta1 were potent and efficacious GTPase-activating proteins for Galphaq and Galpha(11) in P2Y(1)-R -containing vesicles. These results illustrate that the binding and signaling properties of the human P2Y(1)-R can be studied with purified proteins under conditions that circumvent the complications that occur in vivo.

In comparison with xanthines, the tricyclic compounds exhibit increased water solubility due to a basic nitrogen atom, which can be protonated under physiological conditions. Substituents were introduced that confer high affinity for A(2A) or A(3) ARs, respectively. A new capillary electrophoresis method was developed for the determination of the enantiomeric purity of selected chiral products using native and modified beta-cyclodextrins as chiral discriminators. The compounds were investigated in radioligand binding assays at rat brain A(1) and A(2A) ARs. Selected compounds were additionally investigated in radioligand binding assays at human recombinant A(3) ARs and in functional studies (adenylate cyclase assays) at A(1) ARs of rat fat cell membranes, A(2A) ARs of rat PC 12 cell membranes, and mouse A(2B) ARs of NIH 3T3 cell membranes. Structure activity relationships were similar to those of corresponding xanthine derivatives. The 2-styrylimidazopurinones were less potent at A2A ARs as compared to 8-styrylxanthine derivatives. The most potent compound at A2A ARs was (S)-1,4-dimethyl-8-ethyl-2-styrylimidazo[2,1-i]purinone (S-25) exhibiting a K-i value of 424 nM at rat A(2A) ARs. The compound was highly selective for A(2A) receptors vs A(1) and A(3) ARs. Selectivity vs A(2B) ARs, however, was low. Among the 1-unsubstituted 2-phenyl-imidazo[2,1-i]purin-5-one derivatives, very potent and highly selective antagonists for human A(3) ARs were identified. The most potent A3 antagonist of the present series was (R)-4-methyl-8-ethyl-2-phenyl-imidazo [2,1-i]purin-5-one (R-24) exhibiting a K-i value of 2.3 nM and high selectivity for A(3) receptors vs all other AR subtypes.

Radioligand-binding experiments in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human dopamine D-3 or D-2 long (hD(3), hD(2)) receptors showed SB-277011-A to have high affinity for the hD(3) receptor (pK(i) = 7.95) with 100-fold selectivity over the hD(2) receptor and over 66 other receptors, enzymes, and ion channels. Similar radioligand-binding data for SB-277011-A were obtained from CHO cells transfected with rat dopamine D-3 or D-2. In the microphysiometer functional assay, SB-277011-A antagonized quinpirole-induced increases in acidification in CHO cells overexpressing the hD(3) receptor (pK(b) = 8.3) and was 80-fold selective over hD(2) receptors. Central nervous system penetration studies showed that SB-277011-A readily entered the brain. In in vivo microdialysis studies, SB-277011-A (2.8 mg/kg p.o.) reversed the quinelorane-induced reduction of dopamine efflux in the nucleus accumbens but not striatum, a regional selectivity consistent with the distribution of the dopamine D-3 receptor in rat brain. SB-277011-A (2-42.3 mg/kg p.o.) did not affect spontaneous locomotion, or stimulant-induced hyperlocomotion. SB-277011-A (4.1-42.2 mg/kg p.o.) did not reverse prepulse inhibition deficits in apomorphine- or quinpirole-treated rats, but did significantly reverse the prepulse inhibition deficit in isolation-reared rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg p.o. SB-277011-A (2.5-78.8 mg/kg p.o.) was noncataleptogenic and did not raise plasma prolactin levels. Thus, dopamine D-3 receptor blockade produces few of the behavioral effects characteristic of nonselective dopamine receptor antagonists. The effect of SB-277011-A on isolation-induced prepulse inhibition deficit suggests that blockade of dopamine D-3 receptors may benefit the treatment of schizophrenia.

MAGL inhibitors may accordingly act as cannabinoid-potentiating and anti-inflammatory agents. Although MAGL dysfunction has been implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, it has never been visualized in vivo in human brain. The primary objective of the current study was to visualize MAGL in the human brain using the novel PET ligand F-18-T-401. Methods Seven healthy males underwent 120-min dynamic F-18-T-401-PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Six subjects also underwent a second PET scan with F-18-T-401 within 2 weeks of the first scan. For quantification of MAGL in the human brain, kinetic analyses using one- and two-tissue compartment models (1TCM and 2TCM, respectively), along with multilinear analysis (MA1) and Logan graphical analysis, were performed. Time-stability and test-retest reproducibility of F-18-T-401-PET were also evaluated. Results F-18-T-401 showed rapid uptake and gradual washout from the brain. Logan graphical analysis showed linearity in all subjects, indicating reversible radioligand kinetics. Using a metabolite-corrected arterial input function, MA1 estimated regional total distribution volume (V-T) values by best identifiability. V-T values were highest in the cerebral cortex, moderate in the thalamus and putamen, and lowest in white matter and the brainstem, which was in agreement with regional MAGL expression in the human brain. Time-stability analysis showed that MA1 estimated V-T values with a minimal bias even using truncated 60-min scan data. Test-retest reliability was also excellent with the use of MA1. Conclusions Here, we provide the first demonstration of in vivo visualization of MAGL in the human brain. F-18-T-401 showed excellent test-retest reliability, reversible kinetics, and stable estimation of V-T values consistent with known regional MAGL expressions. PET with F-18-T-401-PET is promising tool for measurement of central MAGL.

Structure-Based Identification of Potent Natural Product Chemotypes as Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Inverse Agonists	MOLECULES			English	Article						structure-based virtual screening; cannabinoid receptors; docking; virtual screening; radioligand binding assay	CB1 RECEPTOR; RISK-FACTORS; OVERWEIGHT PATIENTS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; RIMONABANT; DISCOVERY; ANTAGONISTS; EXPRESSION; BINDING; PROTEIN	Natural products are an abundant source of potential drugs, and their diversity makes them a rich and viable prospective source of bioactive cannabinoid ligands. Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) antagonists are clinically established and well documented as potential therapeutics for treating obesity, obesity-related cardiometabolic disorders, pain, and drug/substance abuse, but their associated CNS-mediated adverse effects hinder the development of potential new drugs and no such drug is currently on the market. This limitation amplifies the need for new agents with reduced or no CNS-mediated side effects. We are interested in the discovery of new natural product chemotypes as CB1 antagonists, which may serve as good starting points for further optimization towards the development of CB1 therapeutics. In search of new chemotypes as CB1 antagonists, we screened the in silico purchasable natural products subset of the ZINC12 database against our reported CB1 receptor model using the structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) approach. A total of 18 out of 192 top-scoring virtual hits, selected based on structural diversity and key protein-ligand interactions, were purchased and subjected to in vitro screening in competitive radioligand binding assays. The in vitro screening yielded seven compounds exhibiting >50% displacement at 10 mu M concentration, and further binding affinity (K-i and IC50) and functional data revealed compound 16 as a potent and selective CB1 inverse agonist (K-i = 121 nM and EC50 = 128 nM) while three other compounds-2, 12, and 18-were potent but nonselective CB1 ligands with low micromolar binding affinity (K-i). In order to explore the structure-activity relationship for compound 16, we further purchased compounds with > 80% similarity to compound 16, screened them for CB1 and CB2 activities, and found two potent compounds with sub-micromolar activities. Most importantly, these bioactive compounds represent structurally new natural product chemotypes in the area of cannabinoid research and could be considered for further structural optimization as CB1 ligands.

Nine hypercholesterolemic mice deficient in low density lipoprotein receptor and apolipoprotein B48 (LDLR(-/-)ApoB(100/100)) and six healthy C57BL/6N mice were injected with 10 MBq of F-18-GE-180. Specificity of binding was demonstrated in three LDLR(-/-)ApoB(100/100) mice by injection of nonradioactive reference compound of F-18-GE-180 before F-18-GE-180. Dynamic 30-minute PET was performed followed by contrast-enhanced CT, and the mice were sacrificed at 60 minutes after injection. Tissue samples were obtained for ex vivo biodistribution measurements, and aortas were cut into serial cryosections for digital autoradiography.) The presence of macrophages and TSPO was studied by immunohistochemistry.) e F-18-GE-180 retention in plaque areas with different macrophage densities and lesion-free vessel wall were compared. Results.) e LDLR-/-ApoB(100/100) mice showed large, inflamed plaques in the aorta. Autoradiography revealed significantly higher 18F-GE-180 retention in macrophage-rich plaque areas than in noninflamed areas (count densities 150 +/- 45 PSL/mm(2) versus 51 +/- 12 PSL/mm2, p < 0.001). Prominent retention in the vessel wall without plaque was also observed (220 +/- 41 PSL/mm(2)). Blocking with nonradioactive GE-180 diminished the difference in count densities between macrophage-rich and noninflamed areas in atherosclerotic plaques and lowered the count density in vessel wall without plaque. Conclusion. F-18-GE-180 shows specific uptake in macrophage-rich areas of atherosclerotic plaques in mice. However, retention in atherosclerotic lesions does not exceed that in lesion-free vessel wall.) e third-generation TSPO radioligand F-18-GE-180 did not show improved characteristics for imaging atherosclerotic plaque inflammation compared to previously studied TSPO-targeting tracers.

One of the most important physicochemical properties is the lipophilicity, measured by means of shake-flask (logP) or HPLC methods. Yet, a plethora of experimental methods are described in the literature for the determination of logP values. These varying methods often lead to different results for one identical compound, which complicates any comparison or prediction for subsequent preclinical studies. However, a standardized and internationally applied and accepted database with logP values for a reliable comparison of the lipophilic character of radiotracers is still missing. Method: Lipophilicity measurements were performed with 121 molecules using a high throughput HPLC method and ClogP values were calculated using ChemBioDraw. Furthermore, logP measurements for six representative radiotracers were performed with the conventional shake-flask method and the results were statistically compared to the ClogP and HPLC logP results. Different logP thresholds, suggesting optimal BBB penetration according to literature, were selected and put into relation with the acquired HPLC logP and ClogP values of cerebral tracers. Results: The results of the tested compounds ranged from 2.1 to 5.4 with the applied HPLC method. The acquired database comprises ClogP values of the whole set of compounds ranging from 4.11 to 6.12. LogP data from different methods were not comparable. The correlation of the obtained logP data to thresholds suggesting an optimal brain uptake resulted in a high number of false positive classifications. Conclusion: The logP determination for prediction of BBB penetration is obsolete. The extensive database, including clinical relevant radiotracers, can be used as comparative set of values for preclinical studies, and serves as a basis for further critical discussions concerning the eligibility of logR (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

This article aims to extend the utility of TSPO imaging in WM using a second-generation radioligand, [F-18]-FEPPA, and high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) positron emission tomography (PET) camera system. Four WM regions of interests (WM-ROI), relevant to the study of aging and neuroinflammatory diseases, were examined. The corpus callosum, cingulum bundle, superior longitudinal fasciculus, and posterior limb of internal capsule were delineated automatically onto subject's T-1-weighted magnetic resonance image using a diffusion tensor imaging-based WM template. The TSPO polymorphism (rs6971) stratified individuals to three genetic groups: high-affinity binders (HAB), mixed-affinity binders (MAB), and low-affinity binders. [F-18]-FEPPA PET scans were acquired on 32 healthy subjects and analyzed using a full kinetic compartment analysis. The two-tissue compartment model showed moderate identifiability (coefficient of variation 15-19%) for [F-18]-FEPPA total volume distribution (V-T) in WM-ROIs. Noise affects V-T variability, although its effect on bias was small (6%). In a worst-case scenario, 6% of simulated data did not fit reliably. A simulation of increased TSPO density exposed minimal effect on variability and identifiability of [F-18]-FEPPA V-T in WM-ROIs. We found no association between age and [F-18]-FEPPA V-T in WM-ROIs. The V-T values were 15% higher in HAB than in MAB, although the difference was not statistically significant. This study provides evidence for the utility and limitations of [F-18]-FEPPA PET to measure TSPO expression in WM. Synapse 68:536-547, 2014. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Since [F-18]fallypride is extensively metabolized in vivo and since PET examinations are long lasting in humans, the rapid measurement of the unchanged radiotracer in plasma is essential for the quantification of images. The present study aims: i) to evaluate if the radiometabolites of [F-18]fallypride cross the blood-brain barrier in rodents, ii) to identify these radiometabolites in baboon plasma and iii) to develop a rapid solid phase extraction method (SPE) suitable for human applications to quantify both [F-18]fallypride and its radiometabolites in plasma. Methods: The metabolites P450-dependant in rat and human liver microsomes were characterized by LC-MS-MS and compared to those detected in vivo. Sequential solvent elution on Oasis(R)-MCX-SPE cartridges was used to quantify [F-18]fallypride and its radiometabolites. Result: In rat microsomal incubations, five metabolites generated upon N/O-dealkylation or hydroxylation at the pyrrolidine and/or at the benzamide moiety were identified. No radiometabolite was detected in the rat brain. N-dealkylated and hydroxylated derivatives were detected in human microsomal incubations as well as in baboon plasma. The use of SPE (total recovery 100.2% +/- 2.8%, extraction yield 95.5% +/- 0.3%) allowed a complete separation of [F-18]fallypride from its radiometabolites in plasma and evaluate [F-18]fallypride at 150 min pi to be 22% +/- 5% of plasma radioactivity. Conclusions: The major in vivo radiometabolites of [F-18]fallypride were produced by N-dealkylation and hydroxylation. Allowing the rapid analysis of multiple plasma samples, SPE is a method of choice for the determination of [F-18]fallypride until late images required for quantitative PET imaging in humans.

The three different human alpha(2)-AR subtypes alpha(2A) alpha(2B) and alpha(2C) are widely distributed in tissues, but so far only a few subtype-selective ligands have been identified. In this project, we set off to conduct a large chemical screen for activity on the human alpha(2B)-AR and studied the selectivity of the active compounds towards the human alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-AR subtypes. We employed a radioligand competition binding assay that was optimized and miniaturized into a robotic environment. Membrane fractions containing recombinant human receptor subtypes were prepared from stably transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Initially identified hits were followed up and characterized, and chemoinformatics tools were applied to gain better understanding of the relevance of the results. After a primary screen against alpha(2B)-AR, 176 compounds of the 17,952 included in the library were declared as active at 10 mu M, of which 89 compounds were further selected for potency and affinity determinations using the three human alpha(2)-AR subtypes. One of the identified positive hits was 2 '', 2''''-Bisepigallocatechin digallate, which was found to have high affinity at all three human alpha(2)-AR subtypes. This represents the first non-protonable molecule identified as able to interact with these receptors. Additionally, results obtained with a functional assay (agonist-induced stimulation of [S-35]GTR gamma S binding) supported the identification of another positive hit, lysergol, as a partial agonist of the human alpha(2)-AR subtypes. The dataset of confirmed active chemical species represents a readily available, high quality source for follow-up studies. Altogether, these results provide novel research approaches for drug discovery of modulators of the alpha(2)-AR subtypes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study describes a novel deuterated radioligand [F-18]fluoroethyl [FE]-DTBZ-d4, aimed to increase the stability against in vivo defluorination previously observed for [F-18]FE-DTBZ. Methods: [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 was synthesized by alkylation of 9-O-desmethyl-(+)-DTBZ precursor with deuterated [F-18]FE bromide ([F-18]FCD2CD2Br). Radioligand binding potential [BP] was assessed by an in vitro saturation homogenate binding assay using human endocrine and exocrine pancreatic tissues. In vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [PK/PD] was studied in a porcine model by PET/computed tomography, and the rate of defluorination was quantified by compartmental modeling. Results: [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 was produced in reproducible good radiochemical yield in 100 +/- 20 min. Radiochemical purity of the formulated product was > 98% for up to 5 h with specific radioactivities that ranged from 192 to 529 GBq/mu mol at the end of the synthesis. The in vitro BP for VMAT2 in the islet tissue was 27.0 +/- 8.8, and for the exocrine tissue, 1.7 +/- 1.0. The rate of in vivo defluorination was decreased significantly (k(defluorination) = 0.0016 +/- 0.0007 min(-1)) compared to the non-deuterated analogue (k(defluorination) = 0.012 +/- 0.002 min(-1)), resulting in a six fold increase in half-life stability. Conclusions: [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 has similar PK and PD properties for VMAT2 imaging as its non-deuterated analogue [F-18]FE-DTBZ in addition to gaining significantly increased stability against defluorination. [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 is a prime candidate for future preclinical and clinical studies on focal clusters of beta cells, such as in intramuscular islet grafts.

Radiosynthesis and ex vivo evaluation of (<i>R</i>)-(-)-2-chloro-<i>N</i>-[1-<SUP>11</SUP>C-propyl]<i>n</i>-propylnorapomorphine	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PET; Agonist; D-2; D-3; Dopamine; Apomorphine; 2-Cl-[C-11)-(-)-NPA; [C-11]-(-)-NPA; Radioligand; P-glycoprotein; Amphetamine	DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; AGONIST; BINDING; RADIOTRACER; COMPETITION	Introduction: Several dopamine D-2 agonist radioligands have been used with positron emission tomography (PET), including [C-11-]-(-)-MNPA, [C-11-]-(-)-NPA and [C-11]-(+)-PHNO. These radioligands are considered particularly powerful for detection of endogenous dopamine release, but they either provide PET brain images with limited contrast or have affinity for both D-2 and D-3 receptors. We here present the carbon-11 radiolabeling and ex vivo evaluation of 2-Cl-(-)-NPA, a novel PET-tracer candidate with high in vitro D-2/D-3 selectivity. Methods: 2-Cl-[C-11]-(-)-NPA and [C-11]-(-)-NPA were synthesized by a two step N-acylation-reduction process using [C-11]-propionyl chloride. Awake rats were injected with either tracer, via the tail vein. The rats were decapitated at various times, the brains were removed and quickly dissected, and plasma metabolites were measured. Radioligand specificity, and P-glycoprotein involvement in brain uptake, was also assessed. Results: 2-Cl-[C-11]-(-)-NPA and [C-11]-(-)-NPA were produced in high specific activity and purity. 2-Cl-[C-11]-(-)-NPA accumulated slower in the striatum than [C-11]-(-)-NPA, reaching maximum concentrations after 30 min. The maximal striatal uptake of 2-Cl-[C-11]-(-)-NPA (standard uptake value 0.72 +/- 0.24) was approximately half that of [C-11]-(-)-NPA (standard uptake value 1.37 +/- 0.18). Nonspecific uptake was similar for the two compounds. 2-Cl-[C-11]-(-)-NPA was metabolized quickly, leaving only 17% of the parent compound in the plasma after 30 min. The specific binding of 2-Cl-[C-11]-(-)-NPA was completely blocked and inhibition of P-glycoprotein did not alter the brain uptake. Conclusion: Ex vivo experiments showed, despite a favorable D-2/D-3 selectivity, that 2-Cl-[C-11]-(-)-NPA is inferior to [C-11]-(-)-NPA as a PET tracer in rat, because of slower brain uptake and lower specific to nonspecific binding ratio.

Biochemical binding techniques have been used with the D-2-like receptor antagonist radioligand [H-3]-Raclopride and the A(2A) receptor antagonist radioligand [H-3]-ZM 241385 and immunoblots to study their expression. A substantial and significant increase in functional A(2A), but not in functional D-2 receptors, was observed in the nucleus accumbens immediately following 10 days of cocaine self-administration which returned to normal levels after 7 days of drug withdrawal. In contrast, in the posterior dorsal striatum significant reductions in A(2A) expression were observed immediately after cocaine self-administration which was associated with a trend for a reduction of the A(2A) receptor antagonist binding sites. In cocaine withdrawal groups, significant increases in the density and K-d value of D-2-like antagonist binding sites were-observed in the nucleus accumbens in the absence of changes in D-2 expression, suggesting an up-regulation of D-3 receptors in this region after cocaine withdrawal. A(2A) receptor increases in the nucleus accumbens induced by cocaine may represent a compensatory up-regulation to counteract cocaine-induced increases in D-2 signaling and D-3 signaling which is in line with its disappearance in the 7-day withdrawal group displaying increased reinforcing efficacy of cocaine. A(2A) agonists may therefore represent cocaine antagonist drugs to be used in treatment of cocaine addiction acting inter alia. by antagonizing signaling in accumbens A(2A)/D-2 and A(2A)/D-3 heteromers.

Here, we evaluated corticotropin-releasing factor 1 (CRF1) receptor regulation by nonpeptide antagonists. The antagonist mechanism was investigated at the G protein-coupled (RG) and uncoupled (R) states of the receptor in membranes from Ltk(-) cells expressing the cloned human CRF1 receptor. R was detected with the antagonist I-125-astressin with 30 muM guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate present, and RG detected using I-125-sauvagine. At the R state, nonpeptide antagonists antalarmin, NBI 27914, NBI 35965, and DMP-696 only partially inhibited I-125-astressin binding (22-32% maximal inhibition). NBI 35965 accelerated I-125-astressin dissociation and only partially increased the IC50 value of unlabeled sauvagine, CRF, and urocortin for displacing I-125-astressin binding (by 4.0-7.1-fold). Reciprocal effects at the R state were demonstrated using [H-3]NBI 35965: agonist peptides only partially inhibited binding (by 13-40%) and accelerated [H-3] NBI 35965 dissociation. These data are quantitatively consistent with nonpeptide antagonist and peptide ligand binding spatially distinct sites, with mutual, weak negative cooperativity (allosteric inhibition) between their binding. At the RG state the compounds near fully inhibited I-125-sauvagine binding at low radioligand concentrations (79-94 pM). NBI 35965 did not completely inhibit I-125-sauvagine binding at high radioligand concentrations (82 +/- 1%, 1.3-2.1 nM) and slowed dissociation of I-125-sauvagine and I-125-CRF. The antagonist effect at RG is consistent with either strong allosteric inhibition or competitive inhibition at one of the peptide agonist binding sites. These findings demonstrate a novel effect of R-G interaction on the inhibitory activity of nonpeptide antagonists: Although the compounds are weak inhibitors of peptide binding to the R state, they strongly inhibit peptide agonist binding to RG. Strong inhibition at RG explains the antagonist properties of the compounds.

In this paper, its radiosynthesis is re-investigated and oriented towards the preparation of multi-milliCuries of radiotracer. Typically, using no-carrier-added [C-11]methyl triflate as the alkylating agent, 140-190 mCi (5.1-7.0 GBq) of (R)-(-)-[C-11]Deprenyl was obtained within 30 min of radiosynthesis (including HPLC purification and formulation) with specific radioactivities ranging from 0.8 to 1.2Ci/mumol (29.6-44.4 GBq/mumol). The high efficiency of these radiosyntheses allows for multi-injection protocols and kinetic approaches for absolute quantification of the tracer. Copyright (C) 2002 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Through competitive binding with I-125-PACAP-27, the two ligands exhibited similar dose- dependent inhibition. Additional examination of the efficacy of activating adenylyl cyclase revealed that both ligands analogously stimulated the production of cyclic AMP. Furthermore, PACl internalization visualized by our Fluor-PACAP, is compareable to that performed with the radioligand, I-125-PACAP-27, with maximal internalization achieved within thirty minutes. Thus, Fluor-PACAP exhibits intracellular signaling abilities homologous to the native ligand. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The efficacy of these paracrine or autocrine loops depends on the expression of specific receptors on tumor cells. Once specific receptors are identified, specific neuropeptide antagonists disrupting paracrine and autocrine loops could be potential treatments in neuropeptide-secreting tumors. In the present study, 11 human tumor cell lines representing astrocytoma, lymphoma, and pancreatic, prostate, lung and colon carcinomas were examined for expression of five different neuropeptide receptors (cholecystokinin, neurotensin, vasopressin, tachykinine substance P and cannabinoid) using RT-PCR and radioligand binding. The presence of various neuropeptide receptors in different human cancer cell lines supports development of new antitumor treatments based on disruption of neuropeptide autocrine growth pathways.

South African guidelines for receptor radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA in prostate cancer	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY			English	Article						Lu-177-PSMA; RLT; metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer; theranostics	RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; INCREASED SURVIVAL; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; PSMA; ENZALUTAMIDE; MITOXANTRONE; PREDNISONE; MANAGEMENT; DOSIMETRY; PAIN	Background: Prostate cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in South Africa, as it is in the rest of the world. In African men, however, prostate cancer tends to follow a more aggressive course when compared to their European counterparts. This is attributed to a plethora of diverse factors of which an underlying genetic component has been shown to be an important aspect. Such differences highlight the need for individualised therapy and for local guidelines. The aim of this guideline is to aid nuclear physicians and other clinicians who manage patients with prostate cancer in the correct identification and treatment of patients who are likely to benefit from receptor radioligand therapy. Recommendations: There are a multitude of treatment modalities available for the treatment of prostate cancer and these therapies may be required at various time points during the course of the disease in any individual patient. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial in deciding which therapy, or combination of therapies, would be most advantageous at particular time points. The multidisciplinary team should include a urologist, oncologist and nuclear medicine physician as a minimum, and should ideally also involve a palliative/pain specialist, a dietician and a psychologist. Conclusion: Treatment with Lu-177-PSMA has emerged as a promising systemic modality, which involves the delivery of targeted radiation therapy in the form of beta-particles to sites of tumour tissue. Therapy is provided on an outpatient basis, is well tolerated with relatively few side effects and has a positive effect on overall survival and quality of life. At present, it is used mostly in the setting of advanced, castrate-resistant cancer. Patients are selected (amongst other criteria) based on the prior PSMA-based SPECT/PET/CT imaging ((99)mTc-,Ga-68- or F-18-PSMA), which should demonstrate sufficient receptor expression in order to consider PSMA-based targeted radionuclide therapy. Such imaging of an intended target prior to its therapeutic targeting is known as a theranostic approach.	[Vorster, M.; Lawal, I. O.; Sathekge, M.

PET kinetics of radiolabeled antidepressant, [<i>N</i>-methyl-<SUP>11</SUP>C]mirtazapine, in the human brain	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						[C-11]mirtazapine; antidepressant; PET; kinetic models; distribution volume; binding potential; human brain	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; MIRTAZAPINE; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; ENANTIOMERS; MODEL	Background: We compared six kinetic models with and without the requirement of arterial cannulation for estimating the binding potential of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine in the living human brain. Methods: Distribution volumes of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine in brain regions were estimated using single-and two-tissue compartment models as well as a graphical plasma input model. The two-tissue compartment model provided a direct estimate of the binding potentials of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine in brain regions, while binding potentials of the single-tissue compartment model and the graphical plasma input model were estimated indirectly from ratios of distribution volumes in brain regions. We obtained also direct estimates of binding potentials using a graphical reference tissue model and two nonlinear reference tissue models. Results: The two-tissue compartment model required several fits with different initial guesses for avoiding negative values of parameters. Despite the extra fits, estimates of distribution volumes and binding potentials of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine obtained by the two-tissue compartment model were far more variable than those produced by the other methods. The graphical plasma input method and the graphical reference tissue method provided estimates of the binding potential that correlated closely, but differed in magnitude. The single-tissue compartment model provided relatively low estimates of binding potentials with curves that failed to fit the data as well as the three other methods that used the entire series of positron emission tomography data. The reference tissue method and the simplified reference tissue method provided similar, consistent estimates of binding potentials. However, certain assumptions of the simplified reference tissue method may not be fulfilled by the radioligand. Conclusion: The reference tissue method is appropriate for estimating the binding potential of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine in regions of the human brain so that the binding potential of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine can be estimated without arterial cannulation.

Novel antagonists for proteinase-activated receptor 2: inhibition of cellular and vascular responses <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)); antagonist; Ca2+ mobilization; keratinocytes; radioligand-binding	THROMBIN RECEPTOR; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; HUMAN KERATINOCYTES; NITRIC-OXIDE; INFLAMMATION; PAR-2; SECRETION; PEPTIDE; CELLS; MOUSE	Background and purpose: Proteinase-activated receptor 2 (PAR(2)) is a G-protein coupled receptor associated with many pathophysiological functions. To date, the development of PAR(2) antagonists has been limited. Here, we identify a number of novel peptide-mimetic PAR(2) antagonists and demonstrate inhibitory effects on PAR(2)-mediated intracellular signalling pathways and vascular responses. Experimental approach: The peptide-mimetic compound library based on the structures of PAR(2) agonist peptides were screened for inhibition of PAR(2)-induced calcium mobilisation in human keratinocytes. Representative compounds were further evaluated by radioligand binding and inhibition of NF kappa B transcriptional activity and IL-8 production. The vascular effects of the antagonists were assessed using in vitro and in vivo models. Key results: Two compounds, K-12940 and K-14585, significantly reduced SLIGKV-induced Ca2+ mobilisation in primary human keratinocytes. Both K-12940 and K-14585 exhibited competitive inhibition for the binding of a high-affinity radiolabelled PAR(2)-ligand, [H-3]-2-furoyl-LIGRL-NH2, to human PAR(2) with K-i values of 1.94 and 0.627 mu M respectively. NF kappa B reporter activity and IL-8 production were also significantly reduced. Furthermore, relaxation of rat-isolated aorta induced by SLIGRL-NH2 was inhibited competitively by K-14585. K-14585 also significantly lowered plasma extravasation in the dorsal skin of guinea pigs and reduced salivation in mice. Conclusions and implications: K-12940 and K-14585 antagonized PAR(2) competitively, resulting in inhibition of PAR(2)-mediated signalling and physiological responses both in vitro and in vivo. These peptide-mimetic PAR(2) antagonists could be useful in evaluating PAR(2)-mediated biological events and might lead to a new generation of therapeutically useful antagonists.

EMD-95885 (1) has been synthesized in good overall yield and labelled with carbon-11 (T-1/2: 20.4min) at its benzoxazolinone moiety using [C-11]phosgene. The pharmacological profile of [C-11]EMD-95885 ([C-11]-1) was evaluated in vivo in rats with biodistribution studies and brain radioactivity monitored with intracerebral radiosensitive (beta-microprobes. The brain uptake of [C-11]-1 was homogeneous (0.4-0.6% ID/mL) across the different brain structures studied. This in vivo brain regional distribution of [C-11]-1 was not consistent with the known distribution of NR2B subunits. Also as a measure of specificity the hippocampus/cerebellum ratio reached 0.8 throughout the time course of the experiment supporting the lack of specificity. Competition studies with the NR2B prototypic ligand ifenprodil and EMD-95885 (1), 30 min before the radioligand injection, displayed homogeneous reduction of [(11) C]-1 uptake of 40-60%. Pre-treatment of rats with DTG (sigma ligand), MDL105519 (glycine site antagonist) and MK801 (ion channel blocker) had no inhibitory effect on [C-11]-1 uptake. Use of haloperidol as a blocking drug also resulted in a homogeneous inhibition of [C-11]-1 uptake by 66-60%, which does not reflect binding to dopamine or a receptors. Due to the homogeneous radioligand uptake and inhibition and no measure of cerebral blood flow effects during these blocking studies it is uncertain whether any specific binding is observed. In view of these results, [C-11]EMD-95885 ([C-11]-1) does not have the required properties for imaging NR2B containing NMDA receptors using positron emission tomography. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We have demonstrated previously, using immunoelectron microscopy with specific 5-HT1A antibodies, that an internalization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors is associated with their desensitization in rats given a single dose of the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin. Here, we examined the subcellular distribution of 5-HT1A receptors in dendrites from nucleus raphe dorsalis (NRD)(autoreceptors) and hippocampus (heteroreceptors) after acute treatment with the antidepressant SSRI, fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.). In parallel experiments, the kinetics of in vivo binding of the 5-HT1A positron emission tomography radioligand 4,2-(methoxyphenyl)-1-[2-(N-2-pyridinyl)-p-fluorobenzamido] ethylpiperazine ([F-18] MPPF) was measured in these two brain regions by means of stereotaxically implanted beta microprobes. One hour after treatment, there was a 36% decrease in 5-HT1A immunogold labeling of the plasma membrane of NRD dendrites, and a concomitant increase in their cytoplasmic labeling, without any change in hippocampal dendrites. In vivo binding of [F-18] MPPF was reduced by 35% in NRD and unchanged in hippocampus. Both effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist (N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide) (1 mg/kg, i.p.). In brain sections of NRD and hippocampus, [F-18] MPPF autoradiographic labeling did not differ between fluoxetine- and saline-treated rats. These immunocytochemical results confirmed that internalization of 5-HT1A autoreceptors may account for their desensitization, and the microprobe results suggest that this prerequisite for antidepressant treatment efficacy could be amenable to brain imaging in humans.

Although PSMA expression is not limited to prostate tissue, little is known about its relevance to other types of cancer. Here, we present a case report of a patient with uterine leiomyosarcoma that is progressing while on immunotherapy and treated with Lu-177-PSMA radionuclide therapy. We report for the first time that Lu-177-PSMA radionuclide therapy combined with immunotherapy outside of prostate cancer. We did observe post-treatment reduction of tumor growth rate, although we did not notice disease response based on RECIST criteria. We suggest that Lu-177-PSMA treatment especially combined with immunotherapy may be an option for patients with cancer without other therapeutic options. Insights: Lu-177-PSMA radionuclide therapy should be considered for any tumor stained positive for PSMA.

Design and Characterization of an Intracellular Covalent Ligand for CC Chemokine Receptor 2	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article								Covalently acting inhibitors constitute a large and growing fraction of approved small-molecule therapeutics as well as useful tools for a variety of in vitro and in vivo applications. Here, we aimed to develop a covalent antagonist of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), a class A GPCR that has been pursued as a therapeutic target in inflammation and immuno-oncology. Based on a known intra-cellularly binding CCR2 antagonist, several covalent derivatives were synthesized and characterized by radioligand binding and functional assays. These studies revealed compound 14 as an intracellular covalent ligand for CCR2. In silico modeling followed by site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that 14 forms a covalent bond with one of three proximal cysteine residues, which can be engaged interchangeably. To our knowledge, compound 14 represents the first covalent ligand reported for CCR2.

The affinities of the target compounds for all human dopamine receptors (D-1-D-5) were investigated by radioligand binding assay and their functionality by a calcium assay. Both the affinities and selectivities for the dopamine receptors were found to be affected by the nature of the substituent. The N14-methylated derivative displayed the highest affinities for all D-receptors. In general, the affinities decreased with increasing chain length of the N-alkyl. Different substituents, partly led to altered affinity, and selectivity profile when compared with our lead LE300.

Target compounds were assayed at alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 7 neuronal acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subtypes. Competition binding experiments at alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs showed an overall significant reduction in affinity for the compounds under study in comparison to the reference radioligand [H-3]-epibatidine. On the other hand, compounds 3b, 3c, and 4b exhibited a noticeable affinity for the alpha 7 receptors and 3c showed also a slight degree of alpha 7 over alpha 4 beta 2 selectivity.

An inhibitor of the eotaxin-CCR3 binding interaction may have potential as an anti-inflammatory drug for treatment of asthma, parasitic infections, and allergic disorders. A radioligand binding assay was developed using HEK cells transfected with CCR3, with I-125 eotaxin as the ligand. Whole cells grown on polylysine-coated plates were used as the receptor source for the screen. Screening of more than 200,000 compounds with this assay yielded a number of screening hits, and of these, 2 active novel antagonists were identified. These compounds showed inhibitory effects on eosinophil chemotaxis in both in vitro and in vivo assays. (Journal of Biomolecular Screening 2003:324-331).

Initially, radiolabeling was used to investigate human and rodent tissues regarding their receptor expression. Later, radioligands gained increasing significance as pharmacological tools in in vitro assays. Although tritium-labeling was mainly used for this purpose, labeling with carbon-14 is preferred for metabolic studies of drug candidates. After the more-or-less successful application of numerous labeled H2R antagonists, the recent development of the G protein-biased radioligand [H-3]UR-KAT479 represents another step forward to elucidate the widely unknown role of the H2R in the central nervous system through future studies.

Catechol-O-Methyltransferase Genotype Modulates Opioid Release in Decision Circuitry	CTS-CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						alcohol; impulsivity; dopamine; positron emission tomography; mu opioid receptor	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; COMT; IMMEDIATE; DOPAMINE; ALCOHOLICS; BLOCKADE; MORPHINE; RECEPTOR	Impulsivity, a risk factor for substance abuse disorders, is modulated by the Val158 variant of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene. Rodent studies have shown that opioids enhance impulsivity. Furthermore, alcohol consumption leads to endogenous opioid release in the cortex and nucleus accumbens (NAc), and this opioid release is correlated with greater positive hedonic effect. Using the selective mu opioid receptor radioligand [C-11] carfentanil, we find that, following alcohol consumption, individuals with the COMT Val158 allele have greater opioid release in the right NAc but less release in medial orbital frontal cortex (OFC). These data suggest that genetic regulation of dopamine levels can affect alcohol consumption in part by modulating endogenous opioid release in specific brain regions implicated in reward, which in turn promotes impulsive choice.

The cultures were arrested during the G(1)/S transition or during mitosis. The DOR protein level increased twofold (P = 0.009) during mitosis and DOR mRNA level increased threefold (P = 0.002) during the G(1)/S transition compared to nonsynchronized cultures. DOR mRNA was also elevated (1.6-fold, P = 0.008) during the G(1)/S transition compared with mitotic cells. A premitotic increase in DOR mRNA suggests that elevated DOR protein levels during mitosis might be regulated during transcription. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, high pancreas uptake is a major concern in the application of reported GRPR-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, particularly for targeted radioligand therapy. To lower pancreas uptake, we explored Ga-complexed TacsBOMB2, TacsBOMB3, TacsBOMB4, TacsBOMB5, and TacsBOMB6 derived from a potent GRPR antagonist sequence, [Leu(13)psi Thz(14)]Bombesin(7-14), and compared their potential for cancer imaging with [Ga-68]Ga-RM2. The K-i(GRPR) values of Ga-TacsBOMB2, Ga-TacsBOMB3, Ga-TacsBOMB4, Ga-TacsBOMB5, Ga-TacsBOMB6, and Ga-RM2 were 7.08 +/- 0.65, 4.29 +/- 0.46, 458 +/- 38.6, 6.09 +/- 0.95, 5.12 +/- 0.57, and 1.51 +/- 0.24 nM, respectively. [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB2, [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB3, [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB5, [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB6, and [Ga-68]Ga-RM2 clearly show PC-3 tumor xenografts in positron emission tomography (PET) images, while [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB5 shows the highest tumor uptake (15.7 +/- 2.17 %ID/g) among them. Most importantly, the pancreas uptake values of [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB2 (2.81 +/- 0.78 %ID/g), [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB3 (7.26 +/- 1.00 %ID/g), [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB5 (1.98 +/- 0.10 %ID/g), and [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB6 (6.50 +/- 0.36 %ID/g) were much lower than the value of [Ga-68]Ga-RM2 (41.9 +/- 10.1 %ID/g). Among the tested [Leu(13)psi Thz(14)]Bombesin(7-14) derivatives, [Ga-68]Ga-TacsBOMB5 has the highest tumor uptake and tumor-to-background contrast ratios, which is promising for clinical translation to detect GRPR-expressing tumors. Due to the low pancreas uptake of its derivatives, [Leu(13)psi Thz(14)]Bombesin(7-14) represents a promising pharmacophore for the design of GRPR-targeting radiopharmaceuticals, especially for targeted radioligand therapy application.

Methods: With institutional review board approval and informed consent, patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: group A (n = 10) was treated with a 1.18 +/- 0.09 GBq dose of Lu-177-EB-PSMA. Group B (n = 10) was treated with a 2.12 +/- 0.19 GBq dose of 177Lu-EB-PSMA. Group C (n = 8) was treated with a 3.52 +/- 0.58 GBq dose of Lu-177-EB-PSMA. Eligible patients received up to 3 cycles of Lu-177-EB-PSMA therapy, at 8-wk intervals. Results: Because of disease progression or bone marrow suppression, 4 of 10, 5 of 10, and 5 of 8 patients completed 3 cycles of therapy as planned in groups A, B, and C, respectively. The prostate specific antigen response was correlated with treatment dose, and the prostate-specific antigen disease control rates were higher in groups B (70%) and C (75%) than in group A (10%) (P = 0.007), but no correlation between groups B and C was found. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT showed a response in all treatment groups; however, there was no significant difference among the 3 groups. A hematologic toxicity study found that platelets decreased more in groups B and C than in group A and that grade 4 thrombocytopenia occurred in 2 (25.0%) patients in group C. No serious nephritic or hepatic side effects were observed. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that a 2.12-GBq dose of (LuEB)-Lu-177-PSMA seems to be safe and adequate in tumor treatment. Further investigations with an increased number of patients are warranted.

Sampling schedules for estimating the necessary time-integrated activity coefficients (TIACs) are not optimized and standardized for clinical practice. Therefore, a simulation study to determine optimal sampling schedules (OSSs) was performed on 13 virtual Lu-177-PSMA I&T therapy patients. Method A total of 880 clinically feasible sampling schedules for planar imaging (three time points) were investigated. To simulate the hybrid planar/SPECT method, an additional quantitative SPECT/CT measurement following one planar image was considered. For each sampling schedule and patient, the activity values were generated separately. Measurement noise was modeled by drawing random numbers of log-normal distributions. The used fractional standard deviations (FSD) differed depending on the imaging modality. For activity values assigned to planar imaging, systematic noise between 25% and 75% of the total noise was simulated. After fitting with a mono-exponential function, the root-mean-squared errors of the deviations of the simulated TIACs from the ground truth for 1000 replications were used to determine the OSS. The uncertainties of the TIACs and renal dose coefficients were estimated. Results For the hybrid planar/SPECT method, OSSs were determined to be (3-4, 72-76, 124-144) h post injection (p.i.) with the quantitative SPECT/CT scan shortly after the second measurement. The accuracy and precision of the determined TIACs were in the range of (-3.0 +/- 6.2)% and (-1.0 +/- 6.5)%. This precision was improved by a factor 2-3 compared to dosimetry based on planar images only. Similar results were obtained for the renal dose coefficients. The virtual patients' renal dose coefficients were (0.68 +/- 0.24) Gy/GBq indicating that a population-based method yields an uncertainty of 35%. Conclusion Dosimetry based on the hybrid planar/SPECT method with OSS outperforms dosimetry based on planar images. The high variability in dose coefficients between the virtual patients demonstrates the need for individualized dosimetry.

In addition to its wide range of bioactivity, it exhibits neuroactive properties as a sedative and sleeping aid. The compounds responsible for this activity are yet to be revealed and understood in terms of their pharmacological properties. Here we evaluated the potential of several hops flavonoids in modulating the GABAergic activity and assessed their selectivity to GABA(A) receptors subtypes. GABA-potentiating effects were measured using [H-3]ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB) radioligand binding assay in native and recombinant alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2 and alpha 6 beta 3 delta receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. Flumazenil sensitivity of GABA-potentiating effects and [H-3]Ro 15-4513 binding assay were used to examine the flavonoids binding to benzodiazepine site. The prenylflavonoids xanthohumol (XN), isoxanthohumol (IXN) and 8-prenylnaringenin (8PN) potentiated GABA-induced displacement of [H-3]EBOB binding in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 for this potentiation in native GABA(A) receptors were 29.7 mu M, 11.6 mu M, 7.3 mu M, respectively. In recombinant receptors, the sensitivity to prenylflavonoid potentiation of GABA-induced displacement of [H-3]EBOB binding followed the order alpha 6 beta 3 delta > alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2 > alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 with the strongest inhibition observed by 8PN in alpha 6 beta 3 delta (IC50 , = 3.6 mu M). Flumazenil had no significant effect on the prenylflavonoid-induced displacement of [H-3]EBOB binding and [H-3]Ro 15-4513 displacement from native GABA(A) receptors was only detected at high micromolar concentrations (100 mu M). We identified potent prenylflavonoids in hops that positively modulate GABA-induced responses in native and alpha beta gamma/delta recombinant GABA(A) receptors at low micromolar concentrations. These GABAergic modulatory effects were not mediated via the high-affinity benzodiazepine binding site.

Synthesis and evaluation of two new candidate high-affinity full agonist PET radioligands for imaging 5-HT<sub>1β</sub> receptors	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin subtype 1B receptor; Radioligand; Agonist; Carbon-11; Carbonylation	5-HT1B RECEPTOR; FREE-FRACTION; BRAIN; BINDING; TARGET; MONKEY; CHEMISTRY; MONOXIDE; RELEASE; RAT	Introduction: The serotonin 1B receptor subtype is of interest in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, anxiety, and migraine. Over recent years 5-HT1B receptor binding in human brain has been examined with PET using radioligands that are partial but not full agonists. To explore how the intrinsic activity of a PET radioligand may affect imaging performance, two high-affinity full 5-HT-HT1B receptor agonists (AZ11136118, 4; and AZ11895987, 5) were selected from a large compound library and radiolabeled for PET examination in non-human primates. Methods: [C-11]4 was obtained through Pd(0)-mediated insertion of [C-11]carbon monoxide between prepared iodoarene and homochiral amine precursors. [C-11]5 was obtained through N-C-11-methylation of N-desmethyl precursor 6 with [C-11]methyl triflate. [C-11]4 and [C-11]5 were studied with PET in rhesus or cynomolgus monkey. [C-11]4 was studied with PET in mice and rats to measure brain uptake and specific binding. Ex-vivo experiments in rats were performed to identify whether there were radiometabolites in brain. Physiochemical parameters for (11)1C]4 (pKa, logD and conformational energetics) were evaluated. Results: Both [C-11]4 and [C-11]5 were successfully produced in high radiochemical purity and in adequate amounts for PET experiments. After intravenous injection of [C-11]4, brain radioactivity peaked at a low level (0.2 SUV). Pretreatment with tariquidar, an inhibitor of the brain P-gp efflux transporter, increased brain exposure four-fold whereas pretreatment with a high pharmacological dose of the 5-HT1B antagonist, AR-A000002, had no effect on the binding. Ex-vivo experiments in rats showed no radiometabolites entering brain. [C-11]5 also failed to enter monkey brain under baseline conditions. Conclusions: [C-11]4 and [C-11]5 show too low brain uptake and specific binding to be useful PET radioligands. Low brain uptake is partly ascribed to efflux transporter action as well as unfavorable conformations. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The effect of the sigma-1 receptor selective compound LS-1-137 on the DOI-induced head twitch response in mice	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Head twitch response; Sigma-1 receptors; 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI); Neuropsychiatric disorders; Antipsychotic activity	COGNITIVE-ENHANCING DRUGS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY TASK; 5-HT2C RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL MODULATION; FUNCTIONAL SELECTIVITY; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; LIGANDS; BINDING; RATS	Several receptor mediated pathways have been shown to modulate the murine head twitch response (HTR). However, the role of sigma receptors in the murine (+/-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI)-induced HTR has not been previously investigated. We examined the ability of LS-1-137, a novel sigma-1 vs. sigma-2 receptor selective phenylacetamide, to modulate the DOI-induced HTR in DBA/2J mice. We also assessed the in vivo efficacy of reference sigma-1 receptor antagonists and agonists PRE-084 and PPCC. The effect of the sigma-2 receptor selective antagonist RHM-1-86 was also examined. Rotarod analysis was performed to monitor motor coordination after LS-1-137 administration. Radioligand binding techniques were used to determine the affinity of LS-1-137 at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. LS-1-137 and the sigma-1 receptor antagonists haloperidol and BD 1047 were able to attenuate a DOI-induced HTR, indicating that LS-1-137 was acting in vivo as a sigma-1 receptor antagonist. LS-1-137 did not compromise rotarod performance within a dose range capable of attenuating the effects of DOI. Radioligand binding studies indicate that LS-1-137 exhibits low affinity binding at both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. Based upon the results from these and our previous studies, LS-1-137 is a neuroprotective agent that attenuates the murine DOI-induced HTR independent of activity at 5-HT2 receptor subtypes, D2-like dopamine receptors, sigma-2 receptors and NMDA receptors. LS-1-137 appears to act as a sigma-1 receptor antagonist to inhibit the DOI-induced HTR. Therefore, the DOI-induced HTR can be used to assess the in vivo efficacy of sigma-1 receptor selective compounds. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Imaging Expression of the Human Somatostatin Receptor Subtype-2 Reporter Gene with <SUP>68</SUP>Ga-DOTATOC	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						reporter gene; hSSTr2; Ga-68-DOTATOC; PET	PROLIFERATION IN-VITRO; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; CELLS; ANALOGS; GROWTH; PET; ANGIOGENESIS; INHIBITION; THERAPY; SST(2)	The human somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (hSSTr2)-Ga-68-DOTATOC reporter system has several attractive features for potential translation to human studies. These include a low expression of hSSTr2 in most organs, a rapid internalized accumulation of Ga-68-DOTATOC in the SSTr2-expressing cells, and a rapid excretion of unbound radioligand by the renal system. We performed a series of in vitro and in vivo validation studies of this reporter system. Methods: A retroviral vector containing a dual reporter, pQCXhSSTr2-IRES-GFP (IRES: internal ribosome entry site; GFP: green fluorescent protein), was constructed and transduced into Jurkat, C6, and U87 cells. Stably transduced reporter cells were characterized in vitro using optical and radiometric methods. Multiple tumor-bearing mice were evaluated with Ga-68-DOTATOC PET studies. Results: The dual-reporter genes were incorporated into all tumor cell lines, and their expression levels were confirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), GFP visualization, and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for hSSTr2. In vitro, hSSTr2 cell membrane expression was 36,000, 280,000, and 1,250,000 copies per cell for the SSTR2-transfected Jurkat, U87, and C6 cell lines. Small-animal PET of Ga-68-DOTATOC in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that the in vivo uptake of this radioligand was directly proportional to the in vitro expression of hSSTr2. The in vivo uptake of Ga-68-DOTATOC, at 2 h after injection, was low in all organs except the kidneys (7.8 percentage of injected dose per gram [%ID/g]) and as high as 15.2 %ID/g in transduced C6 tumors. The corresponding transduced-to-nontransduced tumor uptake ratio was 64, and the tumor-to-muscle uptake ratio was around 500. Conclusion: Ga-68-DOTATOC is an excellent specific ligand for this hSSTr2 reporter system and for hSSTr2 reporter gene PET. Because DOTATOC has undergone extensive clinical testing, this human reporter system has the potential for translation to human studies.

While noladin ether (NE) demonstrates agonist activity at CB1 cannabinoid receptors, recent data indicate that NE acts as a full agonist at CB2 cannabinoid receptors too. Considering the functional interactions between opioids and cannabinoids, it is of interest to examine whether NE affects the opioid system. To that end, we studied the influence of NE on V-opioid receptor (MOR) mRNA expression and MOR mediated G-protein signaling. We used real-time PCR and [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays to examine the changes of MOR mRNA levels and the capability of the mu-opioid agonist peptide ([D-Ala(Nme)(2)Phe (4),Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO) in activating regulatory G-proteins via MORs in forebrain membrane fractions of wild-type (w.t., CB1(+/+)) and CB1 receptor deficient transgenic mice (knockout, CB1(-/-)). We found, that the expression of MOR mRNAs significantly decreased both in CB1(+/+) and CB1(-/-) forebrain after a single injection of NE at 1 mg/kg when compared to control. Consequently, MOR-mediated signaling is attenuated after acute in vivo treatment with NE in both CB1(+/+) and CB1(-/-) mice. Inhibition on MOR mediated activation is observed after in vitro NE administration as well. Radioligand binding competition studies showed that the noticed effect of NE on MOR signaling is not mediated through MORs. Both in vivo and in vitro attenuations of NE can be antagonized by the CB2 selective antagonist SR144528. Taken together, our data suggest that the NE caused pronounced decrease in the activity of MOR is mediated via CB2 cannabinoid receptors. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, in vivo evaluation on rodents and primates showed that this ligand was unstable and rapidly metabolized to [F-18]F- by defluorination of the [F-18]fluoromethyl moiety. In this study, we designed a deuterium-substituted analogue, N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[F-18]fluoromethoxy-d2-5-methoxybenzyI)acetamide ([F-18]5) as a radioligand for PBR to reduce the in vivo metabolic rate of the non-deuterated [F-18]2. The design principle was based on the hypothesis that the deuterium substitution may reduce the rate of defluorination initiated by cleavage of the C-H bond without altering the binding affinity for PBR. The non-radioactive 5 was prepared by reacting diiodomethane-d(2) (CD2I2, 6) with a phenol precursor 7, followed by treatment with tetrabutylammonium fluoride. The ligand [F-18]5 was synthesized by the alkylation of 7 with [F-18]fluoromethyl iodide-d(2) ([F-18]FCD2I, [F-18]9). Compound 5 displayed a similar in vitro affinity to PBR (IC50: 1.90nM) with 2. In vivo evaluation demonstrated that [F-18]5 was metabolized by defluorination to [F-18]F- as a main radioactive component, but its metabolic rate was slower than that of [F-18]2 in the brain of mice. The deuterium substitution decreased the radioactivity level of[F-18]5 in the bone of mouse, augmented by 1 the percentage of specific binding to PBR in the rat brain determined by ex vivo autoradiography. However, the PET image of [F-18]5 for monkey brain showed high radioactivity in the brain and skull, suggesting a possible species difference between rodents and primates. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Angiotensin IT (Ang II) is associated with cell proliferation and apoptosis. The role of the angiotensin type 2 receptor (AT2R) in these processes remains controversial. Conventional radioligand binding of I-125-Sar(1), Ile(8) Ang II in adult kidney has failed to demonstrate the binding for the AT2R. Methods. The presence of the AT2R was explored in adult rat kidney by in vitro and in vivo autoradiography using the selective AT2R radioligand I-125-CGP 42112B. The roles of the angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R) and the AT2R in mediating cellular proliferation and apoptosis were assessed using selective AT1R or AT2R antagonists in Ang II-infused Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Results. I-125-CGP 42112B binding was demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo autoradiography techniques in the glomeruli and proximal tubules of SD rats. This binding could be displaced by Ang II and the AT2R antagonist PD123319 but not by the AT1R antagonist valsartan. Subcutaneous infusion of Ang II for 14 days in eight-week-old SD rats induced proliferation of proximal tubular epithelial cells, as assessed by a twofold increase in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-positive cells and apoptosis, as assessed by a threefold increase in terminal dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells. The administration of the AT2R antagonist PD123319 or the AT1R antagonist valsartan was associated with attenuation of the increases in both PCNA- and TUNEL-positive cells following Ang II infusion. Ang II infusion was associated with increased osteopontin gene and protein expression, which could be reduced by treatment with either valsartan or PD123319. Conclusion. These findings indicate that there is significant expression of the AT2R in the adult kidney, and that the AT2R has a role in mediating Ang II-induced proliferation and apoptosis in proximal tubular epithelial cells and expression of osteopontin.

Study protocol for a phase II, double-blind, randomised controlled trial of cannabidiol (CBD) compared with placebo for reduction of brain neuroinflammation in adults with chronic low back pain	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; SPINAL-CORD ASTROCYTES; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; 18 KDA; NERVE INJURY; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; CELL-PROLIFERATION; GLIAL ACTIVATION; PET RADIOLIGAND	Introduction Chronic pain is a debilitating medical problem that is difficult to treat. Neuroinflammatory pathways have emerged as a potential therapeutic target, as preclinical studies have demonstrated that glial cells and neuroglial interactions play a role in the establishment and maintenance of pain. Recently, we used positron emission tomography (PET) to demonstrate increased levels of 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) binding, a marker of glial activation, in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP). Cannabidiol (CBD) is a glial inhibitor in animal models, but studies have not assessed whether CBD reduces neuroinflammation in humans. The principal aim of this trial is to evaluate whether CBD, compared with placebo, affects neuroinflammation, as measured by TSPO levels. Methods and analysis This is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase II clinical trial. Eighty adults (aged 18-75) with cLBP for >6 months will be randomised to either an FDA-approved CBD medication (Epidiolex) or matching placebo for 4 weeks using a dose-escalation design. All participants will undergo integrated PET/MRI at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment to evaluate neuroinflammation using [C-11]PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for TSPO. Our primary hypothesis is that participants randomised to CBD will demonstrate larger reductions in thalamic [C-11]PBR28 signal compared with those receiving placebo. We will also assess the effect of CBD on (1) [C-11]PBR28 signal from limbic regions, which our prior work has linked to depressive symptoms and (2) striatal activation in response to a reward task. Additionally, we will evaluate self-report measures of cLBP intensity and bothersomeness, depression and quality of life at baseline and 4 weeks. Ethics and dissemination This protocol is approved by the Massachusetts General Brigham Human Research Committee (protocol number: 2021P002617) and FDA (IND number: 143861) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov.

Outside the brain, inflammation and COX-2 induction contribute to the pathogenesis of pain, arthritis, acute allograft rejection, and in response to infections, tumors, autoimmune disorders, and injuries. Herein, we report the radiochemical synthesis and evaluation of [F-18]6-fluoro-2-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(thiophen-2-ylmethyl)pyrimidin-4-amine ([F-18]FMTP), a high-affinity COX-2 inhibitor, by cell uptake and PET imaging studies. Methods The radiochemical synthesis of [F-18]FMTP was optimized using chlorine to fluorine displacement method, by reacting [F-18]fluoride/K222/K(2)CO(3)with the precursor molecule. Cellular uptake studies of [F-18]FMTP was performed in COX-2 positive BxPC3 and COX-2 negative PANC-1 cell lines with unlabeled FMTP as well as celecoxib to define specific binding agents. Dynamic microPET image acquisitionwas performed in anesthetized nude mice (n = 3), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced neuroinflammation mice (n = 4), and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) administered control mice (n = 4) using a Trifoil microPET/CT for a scan period of 60 min. Results A twofold higher binding of [F-18]FMTP was found in COX-2 positive BxPC3 cells compared with COX-2 negative PANC-1 cells. The radioligand did not show specific binding to COX-2 negative PANC-1 cells. MicroPET imaging in wild-type mice indicated blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration and fast washout of [F-18]FMTP in the brain, likely due to the low constitutive COX-2 expression in the normal brain. In contrast, a similar to twofold higher uptake of the radioligand was found in LPS-induced mice brain than PBS treated control mice. Conclusions Specific binding to COX-2 in BxPC3 cell lines, BBB permeability, and increased brain uptake in neuroinflammation mice qualifies [F-18]FMTP as a potential PET tracer for studying inflammation.

PSMA targeted radioligandtherapy in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer after chemotherapy, abiraterone and/or enzalutamide. A retrospective analysis of overall survival	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Radioligand Therapy; Prostate cancer; Overall survival	THERAPY; LU-177-PSMA-617	Our aim was to evaluate overall survival and parameters prognosticating longer survival in a large and homogeneous group of patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy with heavily pretreated advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer. A total of 104 patients were treated with 351 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) changes after the first cycle of therapy were documented prior to a second cycle. Patients were followed-up for overall survival (OS). Any PSA decline, PSA decline ae<yen>50%, initial PSA, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), visceral metastases and cumulative injected activity were analyzed and evaluated according to OS. Multivariable analysis with parameters with a p-value ae0.05 in univariate analysis was performed, additionally adjusting for age and presence of visceral metastases. A total of 51 patients (49%) died during the observation period. The majority of patients (97%) presented with bone metastases, 77% with lymph node metastases and 32% with visceral metastases. All patients were treated with at least one line of chemotherapy. Either abiraterone or enzalutamide had been given in 100% of the patients. Any PSA decline occurred in 70 (67%) and a PSA decline ae50% in 34 (33%) of patients after the first cycle. The median OS was 56.0 weeks (95%CI: 50.5-61.5). Initial PSA decline ae50%, initial LDH, visceral metastases, second line chemotherapy or prior radium-223 did not have an effect on survival, whereas any initial PSA decline, initial ALP < 220 U/L and cumulative injected activity ae18.8 GBq were associated with a longer survival. A step-by-step analysis revealed a PSA decline ae20.87% as the most noticeable cut-off prognosticating longer survival, which remained an independent prognosticator of improved OS in the multivariate analysis. Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT is a new effective therapeutic and seems to prolong survival in patients with advanced mCRPC pretreated with chemotherapy, abiraterone and/or enzalutamide.

We recently developed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) ligand, 2-(1-(3-([C-11] methylamino) phenyl)-2-oxo-5(pyrimidin-2-yl)-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl) benzonitrile ([C-11] HMS011). This compound is a radiolabelled derivative of perampanel, an antiepileptic drug acting on AMPA receptors, and was demonstrated to have promising in vivo properties in the rat and monkey brains. In the current study, we performed a human PET study using [C-11] HMS011 to evaluate its safety and kinetics. Four healthy male subjects underwent a 120-min PET scan after injection of [C-11] HMS011. Arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis were performed to obtain parent input functions for three of the subjects using high-performance liquid chromatography. Regional distribution volumes (VTs) were calculated based on kinetic models with and without considering radiometabolite in the brain. The binding was also quantified using a reference tissue model with white matter as reference. Results: Brain uptake of [C-11] HMS011 was observed quickly after the injection, followed by a rapid clearance. Three hydrophilic and one lipophilic radiometabolites appeared in the plasma, with notable individual variability. The kinetics in the brain with apparent radioactivity retention suggested that the lipophilic radiometabolite could enter the brain. A dual-input graphical model, an analytical model designed in consideration of a radiometabolite entering the brain, well described the kinetics of [C-11] HMS011. A reference tissue model showed small radioligand binding potential (BP*(ND)) values in the cortical regions (BP*(ND) = 0-0.15). These data suggested specific binding component of [C-11] HMS011 in the brain. Conclusions: Kinetic analyses support some specific binding of [C-11] HMS011 in the human cortex. However, this ligand may not be suitable for practical AMPA receptor PET imaging due to the small dynamic range and metabolite in the brain.

It is thereby a suitable in vivo biomarker of neuroinflammation for detection, evaluation and therapeutic monitoring of brain diseases. We aimed to estimate the radiation dosimetry of the positron emission tomography (PET) TSPO radioligand [F-18]DPA-714, and we evaluated in healthy volunteers its whole-body uptake and cerebral kinetics. Methods: Biodistribution data from mice were used for the prediction of radiation dosimetry. In human studies, a 90-min dynamic PET scan was performed in seven healthy volunteers after injection of [F-18]DPA-714 (245 +/- 45 MBq). Arterial and venous samples were collected from two subjects, and two additional subjects were submitted to whole-body acquisition. Regions of interest were defined over cerebral structures to obtain mean time activity curves and to estimate the distribution volume ratios by Logan graphical analysis, and over peripheral organs to obtain standard uptake values. Results: The effective dose estimated from biodistribution in mice was 17.2 mu Sv/MBq. Modeling of regional brain and plasma data showed good in vivo stability of [F-18]DPA-714 in humans, with only 20% of blood metabolites 20 min postinjection (p.i.). Maximum cerebral uptake was observed 5 min p.i., followed by two decreasing phases: a rapid washout (5-30 min) followed by a slower phase for the remainder of PET acquisition. Whole-body images demonstrate high activity in the gallbladder, heart, spleen and kidneys. Conclusions: This initial study in humans shows that [F-18]DPA-714 is a promising PET radioligand with excellent in vivo stability and biodistribution, and acceptable effective dose estimation. Therefore, [F-18]DPA-714 could provide a sensitive measure of neuroinflammatory changes in subsequent clinical investigations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

[C-11] PE2I is a new radioligand which binds selectively and with moderate affinity to central DAT, as has been demonstrated in vitro by autoradiography and in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). The aims of the present PET study were to quantify regional [C-11] PE2I binding to DAT in the human brain and to compare quantitative methods with regard to suitability for applied clinical studies. Methods: One PET measurement was performed in each of eight healthy male subjects. The binding potential ( BP) values were obtained by applying kinetic compartment analysis, which uses the metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curve as an input function. They were compared with the BP values quantified by two reference tissue approaches, using cerebellum as a reference region representing free and non-specific radioligand binding. Results: The radioactivity concentration was highest in the striatum, lower in the midbrain and very low in the cerebellum. The regional [C-11] PE2I binding could be interpreted by kinetic compartment models. However, the BP values in the striatum obtained by the compartment analyses were about 30% higher than the BP values obtained using reference tissue methods. We suggest that the difference may be explained by the inaccurate metabolite correction, small amounts of radioactive metabolites that could account for the presence of non-specific binding in the cerebellum and insufficient data acquisition time. Conclusion: The reference methods may be used to quantify [C-11] PE2I binding in clinical studies, assuming that non-specific binding in the cerebellum does not vary between subjects and that an extended data acquisition time is employed. Moreover, the study corroborates the previous observation that [C-11] PE2I is advantageous for PET examination of DAT binding in the midbrain, a region from which dopaminergic innervation originates and which is of central interest for the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders.

In this work, we quantified the biodistribution over time and radiation exposure to multiple organs with (S,S)[F-18]FMeNER-D-2. Methods Whole-body images were acquired for 21 time points in two cynomolgus monkeys for approximately 270 min after injection of radioligand. Compressed 3-D to 2-D planar images were used to identify organs with the highest radiation exposure at each time point. Estimates of the absorbed dose of radiation were calculated using the MIRDOSE 3.1 software program performed with the dynamic bladder and ICRP 30 gastrointestinal tract models. Results In planar images, peak values of the percent injected dose (%ID) at a time after radioligand injection were calculated for the lungs (26.76% ID at 1.42 min), kidneys (13.55% 1 D at 2.18 min), whole brain (5.65% 1 D at 4.48 min), liver (7.20% I D at 2 min), red bone marrow (5.02% ID at 2.06 min), heart (2.36% 1 D at 1.42 min) and urinary bladder (23% ID at 250 min). Assuming a urine voiding interval of 2.4 h, the four organs with highest exposures in mu Gy center dot MBq(-1) (mrad center dot mCi(-1)) were kidneys 126 (468), heart wall 108 (399), lungs 88.4 (327) and urinary bladder 114 (422). The effective doses were estimated with and without urine voiding at a range of 123 (33) and to 131 (35.5) mu Gy center dot MBq(-1) (mrad center dot mCi(-1)). Conclusion The estimated radiation burden of (S,S)[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 is comparable to that of other F-18 radioligands.

Whereas the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor is a bombesin receptor subtype frequently expressed by tumors, the other three subtypes, the neuromedin B (NMB), BB3, and BB4 receptors, have been poorly investigated in human tissues. Experimental Design: We investigated 161 human tumors for their bombesin receptor subtype expression using in vitro receptor autoradiography with the universal bombesin radioligand I-125-[D-Tyr(6), beta-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]bombesin(6-14) in displacement experiments with unlabeled GRP, bombesin, NMB, and [D-Tyr(6), beta-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]bombesin(6-14). The distinct rank order of potencies of these analogues for each receptor subtype allows us to identify the predominant subtype expressed by each tumor. Results: Twelve of 12 prostate cancers, 41 of 57 breast cancers, and 5 of 5 gastrinomas expressed predominantly GRP receptors; 11 of 24 intestinal, 1 of 26 bronchial, and 1 of 1 thymic carcinoids had preferentially NMB receptors; 9 of 26 bronchial carcinoids, 1 large cell neuroendocrine lung carcinoma, and 4 of 9 small cell lung carcinomas had preferentially BB3 receptors, whereas 3 of 9 small cell lung carcinomas had GRP receptors. Renal cell carcinomas had GRP receptors in 6 of 16 cases and BB3 receptors in 4 of 16 cases. Finally, 2 of 10 Ewing sarcomas had BB3 receptors. In situ hybridization detected BB3 receptor mRNA in neuroendocrine tumors expressing the BB3 protein. Conclusions: This is the first study detecting the proteins of BB3, NMB, and GRP receptors in a group of human tumors using differential binding techniques. Particularly relevant is the BB3 expression in lung carcinoids and other neuroendocrine lung tumors, whereas gastrointestinal carcinoids preferably express NMB receptors. These tumors may be targets for diagnostic and radiotherapeutic applications of subtype-selective bombesin analogues.

It has been suggested to be useful for quantification of low-density dopamine D-2 receptor populations, e.g. in cortical and limbic brain areas, We explored the reproducibility of five methods for measuring extrastriatal D-2-like receptor binding potential with [C-11]FLB 457. Seven healthy male volunteers were examined twice with [C-11]FLB 457 thigh specific radioactivity) on the same day, at least 3 h apart. Four brain areas, frontal cortex, nucleus thalamus, temporal cortex and cerebellar cortex, were examined. Binding potentials (BPs) were derived from ii) a target to cerebellum distribution volume ratio, (2/3) two reversible reference tissue compartment models and (4) a transient equilibrium approach. For comparison, BP values were also calculated with the standard three-compartment kinetic model that does not assume a receptor-free reference region. The use of the standard three-compartment model did not result in reproducible BP estimates, The distribution volume (DV) ratio, reference tissue compartment models and the transient equilibrium method all had good to excellent intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) in the studied brain areas ranging from 0.56 to 0.93. Absolute variability was also relatively low, ranging from 5.3% to 10.4%. There were no marked differences in the ICC or absolute and relative variability between the four methods based on a reference tissue (cerebellum). In addition, we did not observe systematic differences in the BP between the first and the second scan. These data indicate that the reproducibility of the DV ratio, reference tissue models and the transient equilibrium method is good or excellent. However, each of these methods includes assumptions affecting their validity. Thus, the choice of method will be critically dependent on the purpose of the study.

Nowadays, with the development of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers, the distribution and concentration of mGlu(2) in vivo can be quantitatively evaluated, which could substantially facilitate disease diagnosis and drug discovery. To demonstrate continuous efforts in the development of mGlu(2) PET tracers, we present an example with detailed protocols, including step-by-step procedures of chemical synthesis of an mGlu(2)-negative allosteric modulator, namely 7-((2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl)-4-(2-fluro-4-methoxyphenyl) quinoline-2-carboxamide (QCA), radiolabeling of [C-11]QCA, ex vivo whole-body biodistribution, auto-radiography, and dynamic PET imaging.

Binding affinities of target compounds were determined (using the method of radioligand binding assay). Compared to comparator agent BP897, compounds 2a and 2c were found to demonstrate a considerable binding affinity and selectivity for D3 receptor, and especially compound 2h was similarly potent and more selective D3R ligand than BP897, a positive reference. Thus, they may provide valuable information for the discovery and development of highly potent dopamine D3 receptor ligands with outstanding selectivity.

An efficient protocol for medium throughput fragment screening, hit validation and affinity ranking after single concentration injections was developed. The screening of the fragment library and the good correlation between online estimated pK(i) values (derived from a single injection) and pK(i) values measured with a radioligand binding assay (RBA, full range concentration curve) have proven the value of the online fluorescence enhancement assay in FBDD. The online bioaffinity system was also used for rapid hit exploration using single point injections of combinatorial libraries at 96-well format. This led to the discovery of an optimized hit with micromolar affinity towards the alpha 7 nAChR.	[Kool, Jeroen; Irth, Hubertus; Niessen, Wilfried M.

In contrast to 2-methoxy substitution, a 2,3-dichloro substitution pattern at the phenylpiperazine moiety induces a 10-fold increase of D3 affinity which is expressed by K-i values of 0.53, 1.1, and 9.0 nM for 8b, 8d, and 8f. Applying aromatic F-18-for-Br(Cl) substitution, high radiochemical yields between 76-82% were obtained for [F-18]8c-f. The most promising ligand, [F-18]8d, was used as imaging agent of the D3 receptor in vitro. However, due to the lack of specific binding, further studies should aim at the development of radioligands with improved D3 receptor selectivity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ang-NPFR was stably expressed for radioligand binding analysis. Ang-NPF exhibited high affinity (IC50 similar to 3 nM) membrane binding; NPFs from Aedes aegypti (Aea-NPF) and Drosophila melanogaster (Drm-NPF) were less potent, with the rank order Ang-NPF > Aea-NPF > Drm-NPF > Drm-NPF8-36.

The displacement of [H-3]-angiotensin 11 binding was dose-dependent and correlated with the degree of polymerization of the different fractions containing proanthocyanidins. A strong displacement was seen for the residual fraction suggesting that the most active substances corresponding to the highly polymerized proanthocyanidins. Angiotensin 11 AT(1) receptor binding might be considered as a potentially interesting biological activity of proanthocyanidins contributing to the very broad spectrum of biological activities of the condensed tannins.

Using this type of reagent is a simple approach for the introduction of the fluoromethyl group into a wide range of nucleophiles using mild basic conditions. Recently, fluoromethylsulfonium salts have been demonstrated to act as a synthetic equivalent for the challenging fluoromethylene synthon. For instance, these reagents can be used for the direct synthesis of monofluoroepoxides and fluorocyclopropanes from activated alkenes via a sulfur fluoromethylide intermediate. Sulfonium salts are an alternative, easy-to-handle option to volatile and environmentally concerning freons for achieving monofluorinated compounds. This review focuses on synthetic application of these reagents known to date. 1 Introduction 2 Fluoromethylation of O-, N-, S-, P-, and C-Nucleophiles 3 Sulfonium Salts for Radical Monofluoromethylation of Alkenes 4 Sulfonium Salts for Fluoromethylene Transfer 5 Conclusions	[Melngaile, Renate; Veliks, Janis] Latvian Inst Organ Synth, Aizkraukles 21, LV-1006 Riga, Latvia	Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis	Veliks, J (corresponding author), Latvian Inst Organ Synth, Aizkraukles 21, LV-1006 Riga, Latvia.	janis.veliks@osi.lv		Veliks, Janis/0000-0003-0955-8257	Latvian Council of Science [LZP-2019/1-0258]	Latvian Council of Science(Latvian Ministry of Education and Science)	Financial support was provided by Latvijas Zinatnes Padome (the Latvian Council of Science; project LZP-2019/1-0258).		65	5	5	8	26	GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG	STUTTGART	RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY	0039-7881	1437-210X		SYNTHESIS-STUTTGART	Synthesis	DEC 17	2021	53	24					4549	4558		10.1055/a-1548-8240	http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/a-1548-8240		JUL 2021	10	Chemistry, Organic	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Chemistry	XE4RL					2024-02-16	WOS:000681422500001

Discovery of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MK-8193 as a PET tracer to measure target engagement of phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						PDE10A; Positron emission tomography; PET tracer; Phosphodiesterase 10A; Imaging; Schizophrenia; Huntington's disease	EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY TRACER; RADIOLIGAND; IDENTIFICATION	Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibition has recently been identified as a potential mechanism to treat multiple symptoms that manifest in schizophrenia. In order to facilitate preclinical development and support key proof-of-concept clinical trials of novel PDE10A inhibitors, it is critical to discover positron emission tomography (PET) tracers that enable plasma concentration/PDE10A occupancy relationships to be established across species with structurally diverse PDE10A inhibitors. In this Letter, we describe how a high-throughput screening hit was optimized to provide [C-11]MK-8193 (8j), a PET tracer that supports the determination of plasma concentration/PDE10A occupancy relationships for structurally diverse series of PDE10A inhibitors in both rat and rhesus monkey.

This ligand selectively and irreversibly knocks out I-2 sites, as defined by [H-3]2BFI binding. Recovery was measured using radioligand binding and autoradiography to determine global and regional changes in I-2 density. The density of I-2 sites in brain recovered from BU99006 treatment with a half-life of 2.1 hours in mice and 4.3 hours in rats. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity and MAO binding density were unaltered in the brains of BU99006-treated animals. These data suggest that the I-2 site that reacts with BU99006 recovers rapidly and is independent of MAO.

Displacement studies on rat cortical membranes using [H-3]-5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid as a radioligand indicated that binding affinities are markedly enhanced when additional hydrogen-accepting groups are introduced into the eastern region of the 2-carboxytetrahydroquinolines. Among the most potent ligands were some urea, sulfonylurea, and crown ether compounds as interesting leads for new diagnostics, especially for the evaluation of PET tracers, which allow biodistribution studies and NMDA receptor studies in the living organism.

Herein, we describe the characterization of an M-1 PAM radioligand, 8-((1S,2S)-2-hydroxycyclohexyl)-5-((6-(methyl-t3)pyridin-3-yl)-methyl)-8,9-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[3,4-hour]quinolin-7-one ([H-3]PT-1284), as a tool for characterizing the M-1 allosteric binding site, as well as profiling novel M-1 PAMs. 8-((1S,2S)-2-Hydroxycyclohexyl)-5-((6-methylpyridin-3-yl)methyl)-8,9-dihydro-7H-pyrrolo[3,4-hour]quinolin-7-one (PT-1284 (1)) was shown to potentiate acetylcholine (ACh) in an M-1 fluorometric imaging plate reader (FLIPR) functional assay (EC50, 36 nM) and carbachol in a hippocampal slice electrophysiology assay (EC50, 165 nM). PT-1284 (1) also reduced the concentration of ACh required to inhibit [H-3]N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) binding to M-1, left-shifting the ACh Ki approximately 19-fold at 10 mu M. Saturation analysis of a human M-1 mAChR stable cell line showed that [H-3]PT-1284 bound to M-1 mAChR in the presence of 1 mM ACh with K-d, 4.23 nM, and saturable binding capacity (B-max), 6.38 pmol/mg protein. M-1 selective PAMs were shown to inhibit [H-3]PT-1284 binding in a concentration-responsive manner, whereas M1 allosteric and orthosteric agonists showed weak affinity (>30 mu M). A strong positive correlation (R-2 = 0.86) was found to exist between affinity values generated for nineteen M-1 PAMs in the [H-3]PT-1284 binding assay and the EC50 values of these ligands in a FLIPR functional potentiation assay. These data indicate that there is a strong positive correlation between M-1 PAM binding affinity and functional activity, and that [H-3]PT-1284 can serve as a tool for pharmacological investigation of M-1 mAChR PAMs.	[Smith, Deborah L.; Edgerton, Jeremy R.; Neal, Sarah; Grimwood, Sarah] Pfizer Inc, Neurosci & Pain Res Unit, 610 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA; [Davoren, Jennifer E.; Zhang, Lei] Pfizer Inc, Worldwide Med Chem, Cambridge, MA USA; [Lazzaro, John T.] Pfizer Inc, Primary Pharmacol Grp, Groton, CT 06340 USA; [Lee, Che-Wah] Pfizer Inc, Worldwide Med Chem, Groton, CT 06340 USA	Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer; Pfizer	Smith, DL (corresponding author), Pfizer Inc, Neurosci & Pain Res Unit, 610 Main St, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

We carried out an acute toxicity study in rats and radiation dosimetry in monkeys before the translation of the tracer to humans. Methods: Single-and multiple-dose toxicity studies were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats. Male and female rats were injected intravenously with AFM tartrate as a single dose of 98.7 or 987 mu g/kg (592 or 5,920 mu g/m(2), 100x or 1,000x the proposed human dose of 8 mu g, respectively) on day 1 or as five consecutive daily doses of 98.7 mu g/kg/day (592 mu g /m(2)/day, 100x human dose, total dose 493.5 mu g/kg). PET/CT scans were performed in four Formosan rock monkeys (two males and two females, each monkey scanned twice) using a Siemens BIOGRAPH scanner. After injection of [(18) F]AFM (88.5 +/- 20.3 MBq), a low-dose CT scan and a series of eight whole-body PET scans in 3-D mode were performed. Time-activity data of source organs were used to calculate the residence times and estimate the absorbed radiation dose using the OLINDA/EXM software. Results: In the rats, neither the single dose nor the five daily doses of AFM tartrate produced overt adverse effects clinically. In the monkeys, the radiation doses received by most organs ranged between 8.3 and 39.1 mu Gy/MBq. The osteogenic cells, red marrow, and lungs received the highest doses of 39.1, 35.4, and 35.1 mu Gy/MBq, respectively. The effective doses extrapolated to male and female adult humans were 18.0 and 18.3 mu Sv/MBq, respectively. Conclusions: Toxicity studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and radiation dosimetry studies in Formosa rock monkeys suggest that [(18) F]AFM is safe for use in human PET imaging studies.

Based on the (R)-argininamide BIBP 3226, a potent and selective neuropeptide Y Y-1 receptor (Y1R) antagonist, we prepared a series of bivalent Y1R ligands with a wide range of linker lengths (8-36 atoms). Exploiting the high eudismic ratio (>1000) of the parent compound, we synthesised sets of R,R-, R,S- and S,S-configured bivalent ligands to gain insight into the "bridging" of two Y(1)Rs by simultaneous interaction with both binding sites of a putative receptor dimer. Except for the S,S isomers, the bivalent ligands are high-affinity Y1R antagonists, as determined by Ca2+ assays on HEL cells and radioligand competition assays on human Y1R-expressing SK-N-MC and MCF-7 cells. Whereas the R,R enantiomers are most potent, no marked differences were observed relative to the corresponding mesa forms. The difference between R,R and R,S diastereomers was most pronounced (about sixfold) in the case of the Y1R antagonist containing a spacer of 20 atoms in length. Among the R,R enantiomers, linker length and structural diversity had little effect on Y1R affinity. Although the bivalent ligands preferentially bind to the Y1R, the selectivity toward human Y-2, Y-4, and Y-5 receptors was markedly lower than that of the monovalent argininamides. The results of this study neither support the presence of Y1R dimers nor the simultaneous occupation of both binding pockets by the twin compounds. However, as the interaction with Y1R dimers cannot be unequivocally ruled out, the preparation of a bivalent radioligand is suggested to determine the ligand-receptor stoichiometry. Aiming at such radio-labelled pharmacological tools, prototype twin compounds were synthesised, containing an N-propionylated amino-functionalised branched linker (K-i >= 18 nM), a tritiated form of which can be easily prepared.

Because this is the first peptide ligand for these receptors, we compared its interactions with the three recombinant human alpha(1)-AR subtypes (alpha(1A), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D)). Radioligand binding assays showed that rho-TIA was 10-fold selective for human alpha(1B)- over alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-ARs. As observed with hamster alpha(1B)-ARs, rho-TIA decreased the number of binding sites (B-max) for human alpha(1B)-ARs without changing affinity (K-D), and this inhibition was unaffected by the length of incubation but was reversed by washing. However, rho-TIA had opposite effects at human alpha(1A)-ARs and alpha(1D)-ARs, decreasing KD without changing Bmax, suggesting it acts competitively at these subtypes. rho-TIA reduced maximal NE-stimulated [H-3] inositol phosphate formation in HEK293 cells expressing human alpha(1B)-ARs but competitively inhibited responses in cells expressing alpha(1A)- or alpha(1D)-ARs. Truncation mutants showed that the amino-terminal domains of alpha(1B)- or alpha(1D)-ARs are not involved in interaction with rho-TIA. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of rho-TIA showed F18A had an increased selectivity for alpha(1B)-ARs, and F18N also increased subtype selectivity. I8A had a slightly reduced potency at alpha(1B)-ARs and was found to be a competitive, rather than noncompetitive, inhibitor in both radioligand and functional assays. Thus rho-TIA noncompetitively inhibits alpha(1B)-ARs but competitively inhibits the other two subtypes, and this selectivity can be increased by mutation. These differential interactions do not involve the receptor amino termini and are not because of the charged nature of the peptide, and isoleucine 8 is critical for its noncompetitive inhibition at alpha(1B)-ARs.

Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Radioligand Therapy Using <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA I&T and <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA-617 in Patients with Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: Comparison of Safety, Biodistribution, and Dosimetry	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate-specific membrane antigen; dosimetry; Lu-177; PSMA radioligand therapy; Lu-177-PSMA I&T; Lu-177-PSMA-617; theranostics	RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; NORMAL ORGANS; PSMA; TISSUE	The objective of this study was to determine the safety, kinetics, and dosimetry of the Lu-177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) small molecules Lu-177-PSMA I&T and Lu-177-PSMA-617 in a large cohort of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing PSMA radioligand therapy (PRLT). Methods: In total, 138 patients (mean age, 70 +/- 9 y; age range, 46-90 y) with progressive mCRPC and PSMA expression verified by Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT underwent PRLT. Fifty-one patients received 6.1 +/- 1.0 GBq (range, 3.4-7.6 GBq) of Lu-177-PSMA I&T, and 87 patients received 6.5 +/- 1.1 GBq (range, 3.5-9.0 GBq) of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Dosimetry was performed on all patients using an identical protocol. The mean absorbed doses were estimated with OLINDA software (MIRD Scheme). Treatment-related adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0, of the National Cancer Institute. Results: The whole-body half-lives were shorter for Lu-177-PSMA I&T (35 h) than for Lu-177-PSMA-617 (42 h). The mean whole-body dose of Lu-177-PSMA-617 was higher than that of Lu-177-PSMA I&T (0.04 vs. 0.03 Gy/GBq, P < 0.00001). Despite the longer half-life of Lu-177-PSMA-617, the renal dose was lower for Lu-177-PSMA-617 than for Lu-177-PSMA I&T (0.77 vs. 0.92 Gy/GBq, P = 0.0015). Both PSMA small molecules demonstrated a comparable dose to the parotid glands (0.5 Gy/GBq, P = 0.27). Among all normal organs, the lacrimal glands exhibited the highest mean absorbed doses, 5.1 and 3.7 Gy/GBq, for Lu-177-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T, respectively. All tumor metastases exhibited a higher initial uptake when using 177Lu-PSMA I&T than when using Lu-177-PSMA-617, as well as a shorter tumor half-life (P < 0.00001). The mean absorbed tumor doses were comparable for both Lu-177-PSMA I&T and Lu-177-PSMA-617 (5.8 vs. 5.9 Gy/GBq, P = 0.96). All patients tolerated the therapy without any acute adverse effects. After Lu-177-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T, there was a small, statistically significant reduction in hemoglobin, leukocyte counts, and platelet counts that did not need any clinical intervention. No nephrotoxicity was observed after either Lu-177-PSMA I&T or Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT. Conclusion: Both Lu-177-PSMA I&T and Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT dem-onstrated favorable safety in mCRPC patients. The highest absorbed doses among healthy organs were in the lacrimal and parotid glands- not, however, resulting in any significant clinical sequel. Lu-177-PSMA-617 demonstrated a higher absorbed dose to the whole-body and lacrimal glands but a lower renal dose than did Lu-177-PSMA I&T. The mean absorbed tumor doses were comparable for both Lu-177-PSMA I&T and Lu-177-PSMA-617. There was a large interpatient variability in the dosimetry parameters. Therefore, individual patient-based dosim-etry seems favorable for personalized PRLT.

This method leverages the success of PSMA-targeted PET imaging, enabling delivery of targeted radiopharma-ceutical therapy; has demonstrated a clear benefit in large prospective clinical trials; and promises to become part of the standard armamentarium of treatment for patients with prostate cancer. This review highlights the evidence supporting the use of this agent, along with important areas under investigation. Practi-cal information on technology aspects, dose administration, nurs-ing, and the role of the treating physician is highlighted. Overall, Lu-177-PSMA treatment requires close collaboration among refer-ring physicians, nuclear medicine technologists, radiopharma-cists, and nurses to streamline patient care.

A human [<SUP>11</SUP>C]T-773 PET study of PDE10A binding after oral administration of TAK-063, a PDE10A inhibitor	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; BASAL GANGLIA; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; DISCOVERY; DISEASE; POTENT	Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is selectively expressed in the striatal regions in the brain and may play a role in modulating dopaminergic and glutamatergic second messenger pathways. PDE10A inhibitors are expected to be useful in treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. In this study, the brain kinetics of [C-11]T-773 in the human brain and test-retest reproducibility of the outcome measures were evaluated. Subsequently, the occupancy of a novel PDE10A inhibitor, TAK-063, was measured using [C-11]T-773. Dynamic PET measurements were conducted three times for 12 healthy male subjects after intravenous bolus injection of [C-11]T-773: two baseline PETs and one postdose PET (3 hours) after oral administration of TAK-063 for four subjects, and one baseline PET and two postdose PET (3 hours and 23 hours) for eight subjects. Kinetic model analysis was performed with arterial input functions. PDE10A occupancy was calculated as the percent change of the binding specific to PDE10A (Vs) total distribution volume (V-T), which was calculated as the V-T of the putamen minus the V-T of the cerebellum. Regional brain uptake was highest in the putamen. Time-activity curves of the brain regions were described with two tissue-compartment (2TC) models. The mean V-T was 5.5 +/- 0.7 in the putamen and 2.3 +/- 0.5 in the cerebellum in the baseline PET. Absolute V-T variability between the two baseline scans was less than 7%. Reproducibility of V-T was excellent. PDE10A occupancy in the putamen ranged from 2.8% to 72.1% at 3 hours after a single administration of 3 to 1000 mg of TAK-063, and increased in a dose- and plasma concentration-dependent manner. At 23 hours postdose, PDE10A occupancy in the putamen was 0 to 42.8% following administration of 3 to 100 mg of TAK-063. In conclusion, [C-11]T-773 showed good characteristics as a PET radioligand for PDE10A in the human brain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors do not play a major role in the regulation of lipogenic gene expression in hepatocytes	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adenosine A(1) receptor; Lipogenesis; Expression profiling; qPCR; Radioligand binding; Hepatocytes	ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER; A(1)-ADENOSINE RECEPTOR; PARTIAL AGONIST; RAT-BRAIN; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; LIPID-METABOLISM; X-RECEPTOR; BINDING	Activation of adenosine A(1) receptors was reported to promote fatty acid synthesis in AML-12 cells, by increasing the expression of SREBP-(1c) (sterol regulatory binding protein 1c) and FAS (fatty acid synthase). Since these findings have important therapeutic implications for the discovery of adenosine A(1) receptor agonists, further studies were undertaken to determine the expression and functional relevance of adenosine A(1) receptor in the liver. To that end, we used two classes of distinct adenosine A(1) receptor agonists: CPA (N-6-cyclopentyladenosine), a full agonist and GS-9667 (2-{6-[((1R, 2R)-2-hydroxycyclopentyl)-amino]purin-9-yl}(4S,5S,2R,3R)-5-[(2-fluorophenylthio) methyl]-oxolane-3,4-diol), a partial agonist. Treatment of AML-12 cells, HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes with either CPA or GS-9667 did not increase the gene expression of SREBP-(1c) or FAS. Furthermore, in AML-12 and HepG2 cells, CPA did not antagonize forskolin-stimulated cAMP production, a characteristic of adenosine A(1) receptor activation, indicating that these cells lack adenosine A(1) receptor function. Consistent with this finding, adenosine A(1) receptor gene expression was found to be very low and adenosine A(1) receptor protein levels were hardly detectable by radioligand binding assays in hepatic cell lines such as AML-12 and HepG2 as well as in both mouse and human liver tissues. Finally, acute treatment with adenosine A(1) receptor agonist GS-9667 had no significant effect on gene expression of both SREBP-(1c) and FAS in livers of Sprague Dawley rats. Taken together, our data suggest that the expression of adenosine A(1) receptor is too low to play a major role in the regulation of lipogenic gene expression in hepatocytes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

Characterization of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]CFT binding to the norepinephrine transporter suggests that binding of CFT and nisoxetine is not mutually exclusive	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Binding; Dopamine transporter; Norepinephrine transporter; CFT; Nisoxetine; Mutually exclusive; Dixon plot	HUMAN DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; HUMAN-NORADRENALINE-TRANSPORTER; BIOGENIC-AMINE TRANSPORTERS; H-3 DESIPRAMINE BINDING; UPTAKE SITES; RAT-BRAIN; COCAINE BINDING; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; NA+; AUTORADIOGRAPHY	The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is an important target for a wide variety of antidepressants and psychostimulants. Despite its prominence as a drug target, there is only one radioligand in use for NET competitive binding assays, [H-3]nisoxetine. However, traditional [H-3]nisoxetine binding protocols often give an underestimation for the affinity of certain classes of NET ligands, particularly cocaine and other tropanes. Here, we explore the feasibility of using the phenyltropane [H-3]CFT for labeling human NET (hNET) in heterologous cell-based binding studies. Assays were optimized for time and protein content and specific, one-site binding was observed. Potencies of tested NET ligands for inhibition of [H-3]CFT binding to whole cells (at physiological [Na+] and 25 degrees C) were similar to potencies observed in the [H-3]NE uptake assay. Inhibition constants (K-i) for binding assays were highly correlated with uptake inhibition constants for all compounds tested (R-2 = 0.99, p < 0.0001). Cell-free membrane preparations did not display the same pharmacological profile. Under conditions routinely used for measuring [H-3]nisoxetine binding to membrane preparations (4 degrees C for 3 h, [Na+] at 295 mM), the potency of nisoxetine and desipramine in inhibiting [H-3]CFT binding became greater than that measured in a functional assay of [H-3]NE uptake at physiological [Na+]. However, the opposite was true for CFT and cocaine. Interestingly, while investigating [H-3]CFT as a potential NET radioligand, we uncovered evidence suggesting that CFT and nisoxetine are not mutually exclusive in binding to the NET. Dixon plots of the interaction between nisoxetine and CFT in inhibition of [H-3]dopamine uptake by the NET indicate that the two compounds can simultaneously bind to the transporter.

In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography of the NK-1 antagonist [<SUP>3</SUP>H]-LY686017 in Guinea pig brain	NEUROPEPTIDES			English	Article						Tachykinin; Positron emission tomography; Imaging; Alcoholism; Anxiety; Depression; Emesis	P NK1 RECEPTOR; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; SUBSTANCE-P; PHARMACOLOGICAL BLOCKADE; MICE; THERAPY; BINDING	NK-1 receptor antagonists have shown potential for the clinical treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, depression and alcoholism. In a recent study, we disclosed the potential for the NK-1 antagonist, LY686017, to treat alcoholism in a clinical population. To assess whether this compound could be utilized as a platform for a brain imaging ligand, we evaluated the binding of [H-3]-LY686017 to sections of guinea pig in vitro. In these studies, [H-3]-LY686017 bound with a distribution and pharmacology consistent with the NK-1 receptor. Using sections through the region of the caudate nucleus, we obtained a K-d of 0.34 nM and a B-max of 31.37 fmoles/mg tissue. Based on its high potency and low nonspecific binding in vitro, we initiated studies to evaluate the radioligand as a tool to measure in vivo receptor occupancy. In initial studies, 25 microCi of [H-3]-LY686017 was administered via an indwelling jugular catheter and accumulation of radioactivity in the caudate (NK-1 containing tissue) and cerebellum (low NK-1 expression) were assessed. The ratios of caudate to cerebellum radioactivity were optimal 2 h after radioligand administration so this time point was used for subsequent studies. To assess the pharmacological specificity of the radioactivity accumulation, we administered various doses of Aprepitant, a potent NK-1 antagonists 1 h prior to intravenous administration of [H-3]-LY686017. Aprepitant produced a dose-dependent reduction in radioactivity in the caudate with an approximate 70% reduction at 10 mg/kg. To image NK-1 receptors, 100 microCi of [H-3]-LY686017 was administered and the brains sectioned for autoradiography. In these studies, a characteristic distribution on NK-1 receptors was observed. Based on these results, LY686017 should serve as a suitable chemical platform for future imaging ligand development. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phase I trial of the positron-emitting Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide radioligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-AH111585 in breast cancer patients	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						integrin; RGD; tumor; positron emission tomography; alpha(v)beta(3)	EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INTEGRIN ALPHA(V)BETA(3); PROGNOSTIC INDICATOR; TUMOR; ANGIOGENESIS; EXPRESSION; ALPHA-V-BETA-3; CELLS	The integrin alpha(v)beta(3) receptor is upregulated on tumor cells and endothelium and plays important roles in angiogenesis and metastasis. Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptide ligands have high affinity for these integrins and can be radiolabeled for PET :imaging of angiogenesis or tumor development. We have assessed the safety, stability, and tumor distribution kinetics of a novel radiolabeled RGD-based integrin peptide-polymer conjugate, AH111585, and its feasibility to detect tumors in metastatic breast cancer patients using PET. Methods: The biodistribution of (18)FAH111585 was assessed in 18 tumor lesions from 7 patients with metastatic breast cancer by PET, and the PET data were compared with CT results. The metabolic stability of F-18-AH 111585 was assessed by chromatography of plasma samples. Regions of interest (ROIs) defined over tumor and normal tissues of the PET images were used to determine the kinetics of radioligand binding in tissues. Results: The radiopharmaceutical and PET procedures were well tolerated in all patients. All 18 tumors detected by CT were visible on the F-18-AH111585 PET images, either as distinct increases in uptake compared with the surrounding normal tissue or, in the case of liver metastases, as regions of deficit uptake because of the high background activity in normal liver tissue. F-18-AH111585 was either homogeneously distributed in the tumors or appeared within the tumor rim, consistent with the pattern of viable peripheral tumor and central necrosis often seen in association with angiogenesis. Increased uptake compared with background (P = 0.002) was demonstrated in metastases in lung, pleura, bone, lymph node, and primary tumor. Conclusion: (BF)-B-18-AH111585 designed to bind the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin is safe, metabolically stable, and retained in tumor tissues and detects breast cancer lesions by PET in most anatomic sites.

This study deals with some aspects of PPB of 2-[F-18]FA. Methods: Patients with different neurological disorders (n = 72), such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis, and a group of healthy volunteers (n = 15) subjected for PET imaging were analyzed for their PPB level of 2-[F-18]FA using ultrafiltration. Protein gel electrophoresis of plasma samples was performed to identify the binding protein of 2-[F-18]FA. The dependency of PPB on time and on free ligand concentration was analyzed to obtain the binding parameters B-max, and K-d. Results: Albumin was identified to be the binding protein of 2-[F-18]FA. PPB of 2-[F-18]FA was low at 17 +/- 4% and did not show significant differences between the groups of patients. Corresponding to this, a narrow range of plasma albumin of 0.62 +/- 0.05 mM was observed. B,m was determined as twice the albumin concentration, which indicates two binding sites for 2-[F-18]FA on the protein. No time dependence of the PPB could be observed. By relating PPB to B-max, an average Kd value of 6.0 +/- 1.5 mM was obtained. Conclusion: This study shows the dependency of PPB of 2-[F-18]FA on human albumin plasma concentration. An equation utilizing B-max and K-d to easily estimate PPB is presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The compounds represent an extension and an improvement of our previous work on this class of compounds (J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 4473-4478; J. Afed. Chem. 2000, 43, 4768-4780). All the synthesized compounds showed A(3) adenosine receptor affinity in the subnanomolar range and high levels of selectivity in radioligand binding assays at the human A(1) A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors. In particular, the effect of the substitution and its position on the phenyl ring have been studied. From binding data, it is evident that the unsubstituted derivatives on the phenyl ring (e.g., compound 59, hA(3) = 0.16 nM, hA(1)/hA(3) = 3713, hA(2A)/hA(3) = 2381, hA(2B)/hA(3) = 1388) showed the best profile in terms of affinity and selectivity at the human A(3) adenosine receptors. The introduction of a sulfonic acid moiety at the para position on the phenyl ring was attempted in order to design water soluble derivatives. However, this substitution led to a dramatic decrease of affinity at all four adenosine receptor subtypes. A computer-generated model of the human A(3) receptor was built and analyzed to better interpret these results, demonstrating that steric control, in particular at the para position on the phenyl ring, plays a fundamental role in the receptor interaction. Some of the synthesized compounds proved to be full antagonists in a specific functional model, where the inhibition of cAMP-generation by IB-MECA was measured in membranes of CHO cells stably transfected with the human A(3) receptor with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, with a statistically significative linear relationship with the binding data.

On the basis of available 5-HT2 serotonin receptor radioligand binding data and various preclinical studies, it might be thought that quipazine bears the hallmarks of a classical hallucinogen or psychedelic agent - agents currently being examined for their potential use in treating certain neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, by definition, such agents require the availability of human data, which, in the case of quipazine, are lacking. Because quipazine is also a 5-HT3 receptor agonist, future human studies with this agent might prove problematic because 5-HT3 agonists are known to produce emesis. Nevertheless, continued investigation of novel quipazine analogs with modified pharmacological profiles might prove worthwhile.

Characteristic features of all active compounds were rapid onset of action and long lasting effect. Structure-activity observations showed that the probability of obtaining compounds exerting anticonvulsant activity was much higher when at least one of the phenyl rings attached to 1,2,4-triazole nucleus had a substituent at the para position. The obtained results, moreover, permit us to conclude that despite the structural similarity of loreclezole (second-generation anticonvulsant drug) and the titled compounds, their anticonvulsant activity is achieved via completely different molecular mechanisms.

Extended single dose toxicity studies in rodent indicated a NOEL (No Observed Effect Level) of 6.2 mu g/kg for (-)-flubatine and 1.55 mu g/kg for (+)-flubatine. We developed syntheses for both flubatine enantiomers and their corresponding precursors for radiolabeling. The newly synthesized trimethylammonium precursors allowed for highly efficient F-18-radiolabelling in radiochemical yields >60% and specific activities >750 GBq/mu mol, thus making the radioligands practical for clinical investigation.

Towards this end, a series of trans-3-phenyl-1-indanamine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in vitro. The biological properties of the most promising compound, [C-11]3-BrPA, were investigated in rat biodistribution and nonhuman primate PET studies. Despite high in vitro affinity for the human NET, the uptake of [C-11]3-BrPA in the brain and the heart was not displaceable with pharmacological doses of NET antagonists. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The standard radioligand for autoradiography of beta-adrenoceptors, [I-125]-iodocyanopindolol, was also included in this survey. All compounds showed either very low uptake in rat brain or a regional distribution that was not related to beta-adrenoceptors, whereas some ligands did display specific binding in heart and lungs. Apparently, the criteria of a high affinity and a moderately high lipophilicity were insufficient to predict the suitability of beta-adrenergic antagonists for visualization of beta-adrenoceptors in the central nervous system.

The 4-[F-18]FDP was prepared by reductive alkylation of debenzylated donepezil with 4-[F-18]fluorobenzaldehyde in high radiochemical yield (decay-corrected, 40-52%) and with high effective specific activity (30-38 GBq/mu mol). Tissue distribution studies in mice demonstrated nonspecific distribution of the 4-[F-18]FDP in brain regions, suggesting that this radioligand may not be a suitable agent for in vivo studies of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), despite its potent in vitro biological activity.

Theophylline, caffeine, and 17 beta -estradiol are,used as template molecules to demonstrate the generally applicable methodology. In the presence of a template molecule, cross-linking polymerization starting from a dilute solution of methacrylic acid and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate yields polymer microspheres bearing imprinted binding sites. Radioligand binding analysis confirms that very high binding specificity is retained when the molar ratio of functional monomer:cross-linker is controlled between 1:1 and 2.3:1. Nonspecific binding of molecularly imprinted microspheres decreases when an increasing amount of template molecule is used for polymer preparation. Compared with previously reported suspension polymerization and seed polymerization, the present method is highly efficient, is generally applicable to various template molecules, and gives uniform microspheres in good yield.

All compounds showed nanomolar affinities for the angiotensin II type 1 receptor in radioligand binding assays and could reduce blood pressure significantly in spontaneously hypertensive rats(SHRs). From which, compound 2b displayed higher affinity binding to angiotensin II type 1 receptor at the same order of magnitude to irbesartan with an IC50 value of 1.26 +/- 0.08 nM in radioligand binding assays. 2b showed an efficient and long-lasting effect in reducing blood pressure, the maximal reducing responses were 40.62 +/- 4.08 mmHg of MBP at 15 mg/kg and 28.39 +/- 2.09 mmHg at 10 mg/kg in SHRs, 39.56 +/- 4.83 mmHg at 15 mg/kg and 29.05 +/- 2.20 mmHg at 10 mg/kg in RHRs, the significant antihypertensive effect lasted beyond 12 h both in SHRs and in RHRs. In the single-dose pharmacokinetic experiments, compound 2b could be absorbed efficiently and metabolized smoothly in Wistar rats after oral administration. The values of C-max, T-max, AUC(0-72) and MRT0-72 were 885.61 +/- 432.7 ng/mL, 5.67 +/- 1.51 h, 6110.28 +/- 7398.33 ng/mL h and 7.87 +/- 2.30 h at 10 mg/kg, 2945.55 +/- 1543.67 ng/mL, 4.33 +/- 0.82 h, 26473.62 +/- 12217.16 ng/mL h and 10.24 +/- 6.94 h at 15 mg/kg, 5759.03 +/- 1331.75 ng/mL, 5 +/- 1.10 h, 89488.44 +/- 18413.15 ng/mL.h and 12.89 +/- 2.0 hat 30 mg/kg respectively. The T-1/2 values of the three groups were similar, about 9-10 h. Compound 2b was distributed into tissues rapidly and extensively after oral administration. The level of it was the highest in the liver, followed by in spleen, kidney, and the lowest in brain. The acute toxicity assays of 2b proved its low acute toxicity with an LD50 value of 1551.71 mg/kg, and no toxicity reaction appeared at dose of 1200.00 mg/kg. These encouraging results make compound 2b an effective, long-lasting and safe anti-hypertensive drug candidate and worthy of further investigation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

With aging, however, progressive degeneration of the cholinergic system impairs both the acquisition of new skills and functional recovery following neurological injury. Although cognitive training and perceptual learning have been shown to enhance auditory cortical processing, their specific impact on the cholinergic system remains unknown. Here we used [F-18]FEOBV, a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand that selectively binds to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), as a proxy to assess whether training on a perceptual task results in increased cholinergic neurotransmission.

IDO1 expression could suppress immune responses by blocking T-lymphocyte proliferation locally, suggesting a role of IDO in the regulation of immune responses. The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of radiofluorinated carboximidamides as selective PET radioligands for IDO1. Specific binding correlated with IDO1 expression as measured through in vitro, microPET experiments. Specific accumulation of the new radiotracer [F-18] IDO49 was observed in IDO1-expressing tumors and confirmed by Western blot and IHC analyses. These results suggest that [F-18] IDO49 has substantial potential as an imaging agent that targets IDO1 in tumors, and therefore may be utilized as a companion diagnostic for IDO1 targeted therapies.

Neuroinflammation is characterised predominantly by microglial activation, which can be visualised using positron emission tomography (PET). Traditionally, translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is the target for imaging of neuroinflammation using PET. In this review, recent preclinical and clinical research using PET in Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and stroke is summarised. In addition, new molecular targets for imaging of neuroinflammation, such as monoamine oxidases, adenosine receptors and cannabinoid receptor type 2, are discussed.

This study describes the development of a series of novel bivalent molecules with a pharmacophore derived from the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol. These dimers were investigated in comparison to their monomeric analogues for their D-2long, D-2short, D-3, and D-4 receptor binding and the ability to bridge two neighboring receptor protomers. Radioligand binding studies provided diagnostic insights when Hill slopes close to two for the bivalent ligand 13 incorporating 22 spacer atoms and a comparative analysis with monovalent control ligands indicated a bivalent binding mode with a simultaneous occupancy of two neighboring binding sites.

Reversible and regionally selective downregulation of brain cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in chronic daily cannabis smokers	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						addiction; cannabis; CB1 receptor; positron emission tomography; receptor imaging	BINDING; DELTA(9)-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; MARIJUANA; DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; ADAPTATION; DEPENDENCE; TOLERANCE; SINGLE; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONIST	Chronic cannabis (marijuana, hashish) smoking can result in dependence. Rodent studies show reversible downregulation of brain cannabinoid CB1 (cannabinoid receptor type 1) receptors after chronic exposure to cannabis. However, whether downregulation occurs in humans who chronically smoke cannabis is unknown. Here we show, using positron emission tomography imaging, reversible and regionally selective downregulation of brain cannabinoid CB1 receptors in human subjects who chronically smoke cannabis. Downregulation correlated with years of cannabis smoking and was selective to cortical brain regions. After similar to 4 weeks of continuously monitored abstinence from cannabis on a secure research unit, CB1 receptor density returned to normal levels. This is the first direct demonstration of cortical cannabinoid CB1 receptor downregulation as a neuroadaptation that may promote cannabis dependence in human brain.

We employed radioligand binding studies to investigate the physical interaction between co-expressed dopamine D2L or D3 and neurotensin NTS1 or NTS2 receptors. Substantial cross-inhibitory effects of both receptor subtypes NTS1 and NTS2 on the agonist binding of D2L or D3 were detected in the presence of neurotensin. To identify ligand-specific modulation and subtype-dependent differences, the novel dopamine receptor agonists 5 and 6 bearing the 7-OH-DPAT pharmacophore were synthesized. Exceptional ligand specificity was observed for D3NTS2 co-expression, which gave a 20-fold decrease in affinity for biphenylcarboxamide 5 in the presence of neurotensin. Comparing the binding properties of dopaminergic compounds in the presence of neurotensin, dopamine receptor subtype-selective profiles of the cross-inhibitory effect of neurotensin were observed.

There was variable uptake in regions of brain known to express a high density of D-3 receptors under baseline conditions. Pretreatment with lorazepam (1 mg/kg, i.v. 30 min) to reduce endogenous dopamine activity before tracer injection resulted in a dramatic increase in uptake in the caudate, putamen, and thalamus, and an increase in the binding potential (BP) values, a measure of D-3 receptor binding in vivo. These data indicate that there is a high level of competition between [F-18] 5 and endogenous dopamine for D-3 receptors in vivo. Synapse 65: 724-732, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Some of the ligands prepared herein exhibit remarkable affinities (K-i < 10 nm) and, most noticeably, the absence of activity at the A(1), A(2A), and A(2B) receptors. The structural determinants that support the affinity and selectivity profiles of the series were highlighted through an integrated computational approach, combining a 3D-QSAR model built on the second generation of G Rid INdependent Descriptors (GRIND2) with a novel homology model of the hA(3) receptor. The robustness of the computational model was subsequently evaluated by the design of new derivatives exploring the alkyl substituent of the exocyclic amide group. The synthesis and evaluation of the novel compounds validated the predictive power of the model, exhibiting excellent agreement between predicted and experimental activities.

(R)-[I-125]MIPP was synthesized with high radiochemical yield (60%) and high radiochemical purity (> 98%). In biodistribution experiments, (R)-[I-125]MIPP indicated that the brain uptake of (R)-[I-125]MIPP was rapid and retained, and that the regional cerebral distribution was consistent with the density of NET. Moreover, the administration of desipramine decreased the accumulation of (R)-[I-125]MIPP in the brain. HPLC analysis of brain radioactivity showed that more than 90% was intact (R)-MIPP. These results suggested that (R)-[I-123]MIPP is a potential radiopharmaceutical for imaging brain NET. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Starting from the endogenous agonist for the H1R, histamine, we synthesized and tested various analogues and ultimately identified several compounds with partial inverse agonistic properties and two neutral Hi-receptor antagonists, namely 2-[2-(4,4diphenylbutyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]ethylamine (histabudifen, 18d) (pK(i) = 5.8, alpha = 0.02) and 2-[2-(5,5-diphenylpentyl)-1H-imidazol-4-yl]ethylamine (histapendifen, 18e) (pK(i) = 5.9, alpha = -0.09).

Here, we aimed to label four 2-aminoethylbenzofuran chemotype based molecules ([C-11]1-4) in the carbonyl position, as prospective positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for the histamine subtype 3 receptor (H3R) by adapting this methodology with use of aryltrimethylstannanes. Radiosynthesis was successfully performed on a platform equipped with a mini-autoclave and a liquid handling robotic arm, within a lead-shielded hot-cell. Candidate radioligands were readily formulated in saline containing ethanol (10%, v/v) and ascorbic acid (0.5 mg/10 mL). Yields for preclinical use were in the range of 5-9%, decay-corrected from cyclotron-produced [C-11] CO2 and molar activities were > 115 GBq/mu mol at end of synthesis. Radiochemical purities exceeded > 97%.

Their main advantage is the potential of good spatial resolution in immunohistochemistry, whereas their main limitation is that they yield less quantitative results as compared to radioligand binding. However, most available antibodies against muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes have shown poor target selectivity when tested stringently, e. g., often yielded similar staining patterns in wild-type and knockout animals or in cells transfected with the target as compared to a closely related receptor subtype. On the other hand, a small number of antibodies have been validated to some degree for selectivity for a muscarinic receptor subtype. Protocols for their use in immunohistochemistry are discussed. However, it remains a key learning that each investigator should carefully establish whether the intended antibody is indeed selective for the target under investigation under the assay conditions being applied.

Radioligand binding studies have been used to study the changes in theophylline recognition characteristics of this and a non-imprinted, reference polymer arising from exposure to elevated temperatures and a range of chemical environments. Polymers were shown to withstand exposure to temperatures of up to 150 degreesC (for 24 h) without loss of affinity for the template. Temperatures above this point induced a rapid loss in binding capacity and a concomitant mass loss. FT-IR indicated that this arises from decarboxylation of the polymer. The polymers exhibited remarkable resistance to extremes of pH, organic base and to autoclave treatment. This study provides an indication as to the limits of polymer stability, which is of significance for the practical use of this type of polymer, e.g. in sensor-based applications.

Methods: A total of 46 pre- and 8-12 weeks' post-PRLT Ga68-PSMA PET-CT studies were reanalyzed (23 comparisons). Prostate-specific antigen drop of >= 50% and >= 25% increase was considered as partial response (PR) and progressive disease (PD), respectively, for biochemical response (BR) while change in-between was considered as stable disease (SD). Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) and MD Anderson (MDA) criteria for morphological response while PET response criteria in solid tumors 1.0 (PERCIST 1.0) and European organization for research and treatment of cancer (EORTC) criteria for molecular response were used. Kappa coefficient was derived to see the level of agreement. Results: The proportion of PD, PR, and SD by BR and RECIST criteria was 9 (39.13%), 3 (13.04%), and 11(47.83%) and 5 (21.74%), 2 (8.70%), and 16 (69.57%), respectively. The proportion of PD, PR, and SD was same by PERCIST and EORTC criteria and which were 8 (34.78%), 5 (21.74%), and 10 (43.48%). The proportion of PD, PR, and SD by MDA criteria was 1 (435%), 1 (4.35%), and 21 (9130%), respectively. Poor agreement between BR and both morphological criteria while a statistically significant agreement with both molecular criteria seen. Conclusion: We conduded that molecular criteria performed better than morphological criteria in response assessment by Ga68-PSMA PET-CT in metastatic castration resistant PCa patients undergoing PRLT.

Autoradiographic comparison of <i>in vitro</i> binding characteristics of various tritiated adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor ligands in rat, mouse and pig brain and first <i>ex vivo</i> results	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adenosine A(2A) receptor; [(3)H]ZM241385; [(3)H]CGS21680; [(3)H]MSX-2; [(3)H]NECA; Brain imaging	SELECTIVE ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; AGONIST H-3 CGS-21680; PC12 CELLS; STRIATAL MEMBRANES; GUANINE-NUCLEOTIDES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; POTENT; PHARMACOLOGY; NONXANTHINE	The adenosine A(2A) receptor in the basal ganglia is involved in the control of movement and plays a role in movement disorders such as Parkinsonism. Developing ligands to evaluate that receptor by noninvasive methods such as positron emission tomography has a high priority. In vitro radioligand binding guides the selection of ligands for in vivo application. This study measured the binding of the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist [(3)H]MSX-2 (3-(3-hydroxypropyl)-8-m-methoxystyryl)-7-methyl-1-propargylxanthine) to rat, mouse and pig brain by autoradiography. Other studies measured binding to membranes from PC12 pheochromocytoma cells. Those binding parameters were compared to those of the adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonist [(3)H]ZM241385 (4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[2,3-a][1,3,5)triazin-5-ylamino)ethyl)phenol), the adenosine A(2A) receptor agonist [(3)H]CGS21680 (2-[p-(2-carboxyethyl)-phenethylaminol-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine) and the unselective adenosine receptor agonist [(3)H]NECA (5'N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine). The potency order (K(d)) in the three species was [(3)H]ZM241385<[(3)H]MSX-2<[(3)H]NECA<[(3)H]CGS21680. The density of [(3)H]MSX-2 binding sites was greater in the striatum than in the cortex. Preliminary ex vivo experiments showed that by 10 min after iv injection, [(3)H]MSX-2 and [(3)H]CGS21680 crossed the blood-brain barrier to the extent of almost 1% ID/g brain tissue, but [(3)H]NECA and [(3)H]ZM241385 to only 0.2% ID/g. The prior administration of unlabeled ZM241385 significantly lowered brain uptake of [(3)H] MSX-2. In conclusion, [(3)H]MSX-2 has a high affinity and sufficient selectivity for the adenosine A(2A) receptor. It penetrates the blood-brain barrier. Sensitivity to photoisomerization is a limitation. Further investigations assess its suitability as a ligand for imaging the brain adenosine A(2A) receptor. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Kinetic Modeling of <SUP>11</SUP>C-SB207145 Binding to 5-HT<sub>4</sub> Receptors in the Human Brain In Vivo	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						positron emission tomography (PET); test-retest; blocking; kinetic modeling; quantification	REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; PET; AGONIST; LIGAND; RADIOTRACER; RELIABILITY; DOPAMINE; MEMORY	The serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4 receptor) is known to be involved in learning and memory. We evaluated for the first time the quantification of a novel 5-HT4 receptor radioligand, C-11-SB207145, for in vivo brain imaging with PET in humans. Methods: For evaluation of reproducibility, 6 subjects were scanned twice with C-11-SB207145 on the same day. A further 2 subjects were scanned before and after blocking with the selective 5-HT4 receptor inverse agonist piboserod (SB207266). Arterial blood samples were drawn for the calculation of metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Regions of interest were delineated automatically on the individual's MR images coregistered to the PET images, and regional time-activity curves were extracted. Quantitative tracer kinetic modeling was investigated with 1-and 2-tissue- compartment models using plasma input functions and the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). Results: C-11-SB207145 readily entered the brain and showed a distribution consistent with the known localization of the 5-HT4 receptor. Using plasma input models, the time-activity data were well described by the 2-tissue-compartment model in all regions and allowed for the estimate of binding potentials relative to the reference region (BPND: striatum, 3.38 +/- 0.72; hippocampus, 0.82 +/- 0.19; parietal cortex, 0.30 +/- 0.08). Quantification with the 1-tissue-compartment model, 2-tissue-compartment model, and SRTM were associated with good test-retest reproducibility and time stability. However, the SRTM-generated BPND values in the striatum were underestimated by 20% 243% in comparison to the 2-tissue-compartment model. The blocking study with piboserod confirmed that the radioligand was selective for the 5-HT4 receptor, that the cerebellum was a suitable reference region devoid of specific binding, and that nonspecific binding was constant across brain regions. Conclusion: In vivo imaging of cerebral 5-HT4 receptors can be determined reliably using C-11-207145 PET with arterial input in humans. SRTM showed high reproducibility and reliability but bias in the striatum, and therefore, the use of SRTM should be considered carefully for individual applications.

Automated synthesis of the generic peptide labelling agent <i>N</i>-succinimidyl 4-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluorobenzoate and application to <SUP>18</SUP>F-label the vasoactive transmitter urotensin-II as a ligand for positron emission tomography	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						TRACERlab MXFDG; urotensin; UT receptors; PET; peptide labelling; F-18	HUMAN TISSUES; IN-VIVO; RECEPTOR; BINDING; SYSTEM; MODULE; PET; VASOCONSTRICTOR; IDENTIFICATION; ENDOTHELIN-1	Introduction: The objectives were the work were to develop an automated production N-succinimidyl 4-[F-18]fluorobenzoate ([F-18]-SFB) and to test whether the vasoactive peptide urotensin-II (U-II) could be labelled by conjucation with [F-18]-SFB. Methods: A TRACERlab MXFAG sythesizer including an HPLC unit was used. The MS Excel synthesis sequence and the standard disposable FDG cassette were modified to allow the synthesis of [F-18]-SFB. U-II was subsequently conjugated with [F-18]-SFB, and the resulting F-18-labelled peptides were characterised using in vitro ligand binding assays. Results: [F-18]-SFB was successfully synthesised in the TRACERlab MXFDG in 44.3 +/- 2.5% (n=25) radiochemical yield in 98 min. [F-18]-SFB (8-12 GBq) has been produced with specific activities in the range of 250-350 GBq/mu mol and a radiochemical purity >95%. [F-18]-SFB was subsequently used to label U-II. Two radiolabelled products, [F-18]-(Glu(I))-U-II and [F-18]-(Lys(8))-U-II, were formed in an isolated radiochemical yield from [F-18]-SFB of 5.2 +/- 0.3% and 29.0 +/- 3.7%, respectively (n=7). Radioligand binding assays revealed that [F-18]-(Glu(I))-U-II had retained subnanomolar affinity. Binding to human skeletal muscle (n=3) was concentration dependent and saturable with K-d=0.84+/-0.51 nM, B-max = 0.69 +/- 0.14 fmol/mg protein and Hill slope (nH)=1.03+/-0.12. Conclusions: [F-18]-SFB has been synthesised using the TRACERlab MXFDG module, allowing production of up to 8-12 GBq of [F-18]-SFB with specific activities of 250-350 GBq/mu mol. [F-18]-SFB was used for the labelling of U-II. In vitro characterisation demonstrated that [F-18]-(Glu(I))-U-II had retained desirable binding properties and may be suitable as a positron emmission tomography radioligand for the imaging of the U-II receptor.

The effect of lithium on the adrenoceptor-mediated second messenger system in the rat brain	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY & NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						adrenoceptors; brain; cyclic AMP; inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3); lithium; radioligand binding; rats	ADENYLATE-CYCLASE ACTIVITY; LOCUS-COERULEUS; ALPHA-1-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; INOSITOL; BINDING; ANTIDEPRESSANTS	Lithium remains the most widely used treatment for bipolar disorder; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its therapeutic actions have not been fully elucidated. We studied the in-vivo effect of lithium on the density of alpha-adrenoceptor (alpha-AR) and beta-AR subtypes and linked second messenger systems in the rat brain. Methods: The densities of alpha(1)-ARs, alpha(2)-ARs, and alpha 1-ARs and beta(2)-ARs in the cortex and cerebellum of rats treated with lithium (0.4%), orally, for 30 days were measured using [H-3] prazosin, [ 3H] clonidine and [H-3]CGP-12177, respectively. The activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and levels of inositol trisphosphate (IP3), both second messengers linked to these receptors, were estimated using [H-3] ATP and [H-3] myoinositol, respectively. Results: A significant decrease in the densities of cortical alpha(1)-ARs (85%, p < 0.0001), alpha(2)-ARs (50%, p < 0.0001), beta(1)-ARs (26%, p < 0.0001) and beta(2)-ARs (25%, p < 0.0001) was observed after lithium treatment. However, only the density of alpha(1)-ARs was significantly decreased (25%, p < 0.0001) in the cerebellum. The affinity of [H-3] prazosin for cerebellar alpha(1)-ARs was increased. A small, but statistically significant, increase (19%, p < 0.0001) in the density of total beta-ARs was seen in the cerebellum, without altering the affinity of the radioligand for these receptors. Basal AC activity was not altered in the lithium-treated rat cortex. However, the norepinephrine-stimulated AC activity, which represents alpha(2)-AR-linked and beta-AR-linked AC, was significantly increased (66%, p < 0.0001). Both basal IP3 formation and norepinephrine-stimulated IP3, which represents alpha(1)-AR-linked phospholipase C activity, were significantly decreased (50%, p < 0.0001) in the lithium-treated rat cortex. Conclusion: Our results suggest that long-term administration of lithium treatment downregulates the cortical, but not cerebellar, alpha(1)-ARs, alpha(2)- ARs, beta(1)-ARs and beta(2)-ARs. Thus, it may be concluded that lithium induces region-specific and differential functional downregulation of alpha-AR and beta-AR subtypes in the rat brain.

Synthesis and evaluation of new radioligands [<SUP>11</SUP>C]A-833834 and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]A-752274 for positron-emission tomography of α7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; PET; Radioligand; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; alpha 7-nAChR	ALPHA-7 NICOTINIC RECEPTOR; BINDING-SITES; AGONIST; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; EXPRESSION; SUBTYPES; CORTEX; BRAIN	Introduction: alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7-nAChR) is one of the major neuronal nAChR subtypes. alpha 7-nAChR is involved in variety of neuronal processes and disorders including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. A number of alpha 7-nAChR PET radioligands have been developed, but a quality radiotracer remains to be discovered. Methods: High binding affinity alpha 7-nAChR ligands A-833834 and A-752274 were radiolabeled with C-11. Baseline and blockadp biodistribution studies in the mouse brain of [C-11]A-833834 (5-(6-(5-[C-11] methylhexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl)pyridazin-3-yl)-1H-indole) and [C-11]A-752274 (2-(6-[C-11] methyl-3,6-diazabicyclo[3,2,0]heptan-3-yl)-7-(6-methyl-3,6-diazabicyclo[3.2.0]heptan-3-yl)-9H-fluoren-9-one) were performed. [C-11]A-752274 was evaluated in a baseline baboon PET study. Results: [C-11]A-833834 and [C-11]A-752274 were synthesized by radiomethylation of corresponding desmethyl precursors. The radioligands were prepared with radiochemical yield of 12%-32%, high specific radioactivity (330-403 GB1/mu mol) and radiochemical purity>95%. Dissection studies with [C-11]A-833834 demonstrated low specific alpha 7-nAChR binding in the mouse brain. [C-11]A-752274 specifically (similar to 50%) labeled alpha 7-nAChR in the mouse thalamus. However, [(11)CA-752274 exhibited low brain uptake in baboon (%SUV<100). Conclusion: Two novel alpha 7-nAChR ligands radioligands were synthesized and studied in animals. Specific binding of [C-11]A-833834 in the mouse brain is low due to the insufficient binding affinity of the radioligand. The very high binding affinity [C-11]A-752274 exhibited good specific binding in the alpha 7-nAChR-rich mouse brain regions. The low uptake of [C-11]A-752274 in the baboon brain is due to its high hydrophilicity, rapid metabolism or other properties. Future development of alpha 7-nAChR PET radioligands will be based on compounds with high binding affinities and good blood-brain barrier permeability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These derivatives were synthesized by cyclization of 7-halogenoalkyl-8-bromo-1,3-dimethylxanthine derivatives with aminocycloalkanes. The obtained compounds (1-33) were evaluated for their affinity to rat adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors. Selected compounds were additionally investigated for affinity to the human A(1), A(2A), An and A(3) receptor subtypes. The results of the radioligand binding assays at adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors showed that most of the compounds exhibited adenosine A(2A) receptor affinity at micromolar or submicromolar concentrations; an annelated pyrimidine ring was beneficial for A(2A) affinity. The most potent A(2A) ligands of the present series were compounds 6 (K-i 0.33 mu M rat A(2A), 0.31 mu M human A(2A)), 8 (K-i 0.98 mu M rat A(2A), 0.42 mu M human A(2A)) and 15 (K-i 0.24 mu M rat A(2A), 0.61 mu M human A(2A)) with the latter one showing high A(2A) selectivity. In NaCl shift assay, 15 was shown to be an antagonist at A(2A) receptors. This result was confirmed for the best compounds 6, 8, 15 in cAMP accumulation studies. A 3D-QSAR equation with a good predicting power (q(2) = 0.88) for A(2A) AR affinity was obtained. The compounds were evaluated in vivo as anticonvulsants in MES and ScMet tests and examined for neurotoxicity in mice (i.p.). Most of them showed anticonvulsant activity in chemically induced seizures; among them the diazepinopurinediones were the best (e.g. 31) showing protection in both tests on short time symptoms, without signs of neurotoxicity. Five compounds, 8, 17, 20, 29, and 31, exhibited anticonvulsant activity after peroral application in rats. Structure-activity relationships are discussed including the analysis of lipophilic and spatial properties. The new compounds, which contain a basic nitrogen atom and can therefore be protonated, may be good starting points for obtaining A(2A) antagonists with good water-solubility.

Charles			Evaluation of TSPO PET Ligands [<SUP>18</SUP>F]VUIIS1009A and [<SUP>18</SUP>F]VUIIS1009B: Tracers for Cancer Imaging	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PET; VUIIS1009A; VUIIS1009B; TSPO; Cancer imaging; Precision medicine	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; 18 KDA; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; GLUTAMINE-METABOLISM; COLORECTAL-CANCER; IN-VIVO; BINDING; EXPRESSION; GLIOMA	Positron emission tomography (PET) ligands targeting translocator protein (TSPO) are potential imaging diagnostics of cancer. In this study, we report two novel, high-affinity TSPO PET ligands that are 5,7 regioisomers, [F-18]VUIIS1009A ([F-18]3A) and [F-18]VUIIS1009B ([F-18]3B), and their initial in vitro and in vivo evaluation in healthy mice and glioma-bearing rats. VUIIS1009A/B was synthesized and confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Interactions between TSPO binding pocket and novel ligands were evaluated and compared with contemporary TSPO ligands using 2D H-1-N-15 heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectroscopy. In vivo biodistribution of [F-18]VUIIS1009A and [F-18]VUIIS1009B was carried out in healthy mice with and without radioligand displacement. Dynamic PET imaging data were acquired simultaneously with [F-18]VUIIS1009A/B injections in glioma-bearing rats, with binding reversibility and specificity evaluated by radioligand displacement. In vivo radiometabolite analysis was performed using radio-TLC, and quantitative analysis of PET data was performed using metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. Imaging was validated with histology and immunohistochemistry. Both VUIIS1009A (3A) and VUIIS1009B (3B) were found to exhibit exceptional binding affinity to TSPO, with observed IC50 values against PK11195 approximately 500-fold lower than DPA-714. However, HSQC NMR suggested that VUIIS1009A and VUIIS1009B share a common binding pocket within mammalian TSPO (mTSPO) as DPA-714 and to a lesser extent, PK11195. [F-18]VUIIS1009A ([F-18]3A) and [F-18]VUIIS1009B ([F-18]3B) exhibited similar biodistribution in healthy mice. In rats bearing C6 gliomas, both [F-18]VUIIS1009A and [F-18]VUIIS1009B exhibited greater binding potential (k (3)/k (4))in tumor tissue compared to [F-18]DPA-714. Interestingly, [F-18]VUIIS1009B exhibited significantly greater tumor uptake (V (T)) than [F-18]VUIIS1009A, which was attributed primarily to greater plasma-to-tumor extraction efficiency. The novel PET ligand [F-18]VUIIS1009B exhibits promising characteristics for imaging glioma; its superiority over [F-18]VUIIS1009A, a regioisomer, appears to be primarily due to improved plasma extraction efficiency. Continued evaluation of [F-18]VUIIS1009B as a high-affinity TSPO PET ligand for precision medicine appears warranted.

Recently, second-generation PET radioligands that can reveal the extent of microglial activation by quantifying the increased expression of the 18-kDa translocator protein have been developed. Here, we investigate whether PET imaging can be used to demonstrate the reduction in microglial activation surrounding a chronic focal multiple sclerosis (MS)-like lesion after treatment with fingolimod, an established MS therapy. Methods: Chronic focal experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE)-like lesions were induced in Lewis rats (n = 24) via stereotactic intrastriatal injection of heat-killed bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and subsequent activation using an intradermal injection of BCG in complete Freund adjuvant. This process resulted in a delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)-like EAE lesion. The extent of neuroinflammation surrounding the lesion was measured using F-18-GE180 as a PET radioligand. The imaging was performed before and after treatment with fingolimod (0.3 mg/kg/d by mouth, 28 d) or vehicle as a control. In addition to imaging, autoradiography and immunohistochemistry experiments were performed to verify the in vivo results. Results: The chronic DTH EAE lesion led to increased ligand binding in the ipsilateral, compared with contralateral, hemisphere when PET imaging was performed with the translocator protein-binding radioligand F-18-GE180. Treatment with fingolimod led to a highly significant reduction in the binding potential, which could be demonstrated using both in vivo and ex vivo imaging (fingolimod vs. vehicle treatment, P < 0.0001). The area of increased F-18-GE180 signal mapped closely to the area of activated microglial cells detected by immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: PET imaging, unlike MR imaging, can be used to visualize the microglial activation surrounding a chronic DTH EAE lesion. Importantly, the treatment effect of fingolimod can be monitored in vivo by measuring the degree of microglial activation surrounding the chronic DTH EAE lesion. This work gives promise for the introduction of new outcome measures applicable in treatment studies of progressive MS.

Pharmacological Characterization of JNJ-40068782, a New Potent, Selective, and Systemically Active Positive Allosteric Modulator of the mGlu2 Receptor and Its Radioligand [<SUP>3</SUP>H]JNJ-40068782	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GROUP-II; AGONIST LY354740; RAT; ANXIETY; BINDING; MODELS; SLEEP; MOUSE	Modulation of the metabotropic glutamate type 2 (mGlu2) receptor is considered a promising target for the treatment of central nervous system diseases such as schizophrenia. Here, we describe the pharmacological properties of the novel mGlu2 receptor positive allosteric modulator (PAM) 3-cyano-1-cyclopropylmethyl-4-(4-phenyl-piperidin-1-yl)-pyridine-2(1H)-one (JNJ-40068782) and its radioligand [H-3] JNJ-40068782. In guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)triphosphate binding, JNJ-40068782 produced a leftward and upward shift in the glutamate concentration-effect curve at human recombinant mGlu2 receptors. The EC50 of JNJ-40068782 for potentiation of an EC20-equivalent concentration of glutamate was 143 nM. Although JNJ-40068782 did not affect binding of the orthosteric antagonist [H-3]2S-2-amino-2-(1S,2S-2-carboxycyclopropyl-1-yl)-3-(xanth-9-yl)propanoic acid (LY-341495), it did potentiate the binding of the agonist [H-3](2S,2'R,3'R)-2-(2',3'-dicarboxylcyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV), demonstrating that it can allosterically affect binding at the agonist recognition site. The binding of [H-3] JNJ-40068782 to human recombinant mGlu2 receptors in Chinese hamster ovary cells and rat brain receptors was saturable with a KD of similar to 10 nM. In rat brain, the anatomic distribution of [H-3] JNJ-40068782 was consistent with mGlu2 expression previously described and was most abundant in cortex and hippocampus. The ability of structurally unrelated PAMs to displace [H-3] JNJ-40068782 suggests that PAMs may bind to common determinants within the same site. It is noteworthy that agonists also increased the binding affinity of [H-3] JNJ-40068782. JNJ-40068782 influenced rat sleep-wake organization by decreasing rapid eye movement sleep with a lowest active dose of 3 mg/kg PO. In mice, JNJ-40068782 reversed phencyclidine-induced hyper-locomotion with an ED50 of 5.7 mg/kg s.c. Collectively, the present data demonstrate that JNJ-40068782 has utility in investigating the potential of mGlu2 modulation for the treatment of diseases characterized by disturbed glutamatergic signaling and highlight the value of [H-3] JNJ-40068782 in exploring allosteric binding.

[F-18]PBR06, a fluorine-18 labeled form of PBR06, is a promising PET TSPO radioligand originally developed at NIMH. [C-11]PBR06, a carbon-11 labeled form of PBR06, was designed and synthesized for the first time. The standard PBR06 was synthesized from 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde in three steps with 71% overall chemical yield. The radiolabeling precursor desmethyl-PBR06 was synthesized from 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde in five steps with 12% overall chemical yield. The target tracer [C-11]PBR06 was prepared by O-[C-11]methylation of desmethyl-PBR06 with [C-11]CH3OTf in CH3CN at 80 degrees C under basic condition and isolated by HPLC combined with SPE purification with 40-60% decay corrected radiochemical yield and 222-740 GBq/mu mol specific activity at EOB. On the similar grounds, [F-18]PBR06 was also designed and synthesized. The previously described Br-PBR06 precursor was synthesized from 2,5-dimethoxybenzaldehyde in two steps with 78% overall chemical yield. A new radiolabeling precursor tosyloxy-PBR06, previously undescribed tosylate congener of PBR06, was designed and synthesized from ethyl 2-hydroxyacetate, 4-methylbenzene-1-sulfonyl chloride, and N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline in four steps with 50% overall chemical yield. [F-18]PBR06 was prepared by the nucleophilic substitution of either new tosyloxy-PBR06 precursor or known Br-PBR06 precursor in DMSO at 140 degrees C with K[F-18]F/Kryptofix 2.2.2 for 15 min and HPLC combined with SPE purification in 20-60% decay corrected radiochemical yield, >99% radiochemical purity, 87-95% chemical purity, and 37-222 GBq/mu mol specific activity at EOB. Radiosynthesis of [F-18]PBR06 using new tosylated precursor gave similar radiochemical purity, and higher specific activity, radiochemical yield and chemical purity in comparison with radiosynthesis using bromine precursor.

SN003 has high affinity and selectivity for CRF1 receptors expressed in rat cortex, pituitary, and recombinant HEK293EBNA (HEK293e) cells with respective radiolabeled ovine CRF ([I-125] oCRF) binding K-i values of 2.5, 7.9, and 6.8 nM. SN003 was shown to be a CRF1 receptor antagonist inasmuch as it inhibited CRF-induced cAMP accumulation in human CRF1 HEK293e cells and CRF-stimulated adrenocorticotropin hormone release from rat pituitary cells without agonist activities. Significant decreases in the B-max of [I-125] oCRF binding by SN003 suggest that this antagonist is not simply competitive. To further explore the interaction of SN003 with the CRF1 receptors, [H-3] SN003 binding to rat cortex and human CRF1 HEK293e cell membranes was characterized and shown to be reversible and saturable, with K-D values of 4.8 and 4.6 nM, and B-max values of 0.142 and 7.42 pmol/mg protein, respectively. The association and dissociation rate constants of [H-3] SN003 (k(+1) 0.292 nM(-1) min(-1) and k(-1) 0.992 x 10(-2) min(-1)) were also assessed using human CRF1 HEK293e cell membranes, giving an equilibrium dissociation constant of 3.4 nM. Moreover, [H-3] SN003 binding displayed a single affinity state and insensitivity to 5'-guanylylimidodiphosphate, consistent with characteristics of antagonist binding. Incomplete inhibition of [H-3] SN003 binding by CRF peptides also suggests that SN003 is not simply competitive with CRF at CRF1 receptors. The distribution of [H-3] SN003 binding sites was consistent with the expression pattern of CRF1 receptors in rat brain regions. Small molecule CRF1 antagonist radioligands like [H-3] SN003 should enable a better understanding of small molecule interactions with the CRF1 receptor.

Efficacy and Haematologic Toxicity of Palliative Radioligand Therapy of Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer with Lutetium-177-Labeled Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen in Heavily Pre-Treated Patients	DIAGNOSTICS			English	Article						LuPSMA; mCRPC; hematologic toxicity; MDS	DOUBLE-BLIND; SURVIVAL; ENZALUTAMIDE; MULTICENTER; ABIRATERONE; PLACEBO; MEN	Background: Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) remains a significant contributor to the global cancer burden. lutetium-177-prostate-specific membrane antigen radioligand therapy (Lu-177-PSMA RLT) is an effective salvage treatment. However, studies have highlighted haematologic toxicity as an adverse event of concern. We report our single-centre experience of compassionate access palliative Lu-177-DOTAGA-(I-y)fk(Sub-KuE) (Lu-177-PSMA I&T) with respect to efficacy and haematologic safety. Methods: Patients with mCRPC and adequate bone marrow/liver function were included. All patients included underwent baseline and response assessment by Gallium-68-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT). Prescribed activity of therapy was a median 6.24 GBq per patient per cycle (IQR1.29 GBq), administered in 8-week intervals, up to four cycles. Response was assessed by prostate specific antigen (PSA) and a week-12 PET/CT. Incidence of grade >= 3 haematologic toxicity, including association with risk factors (age >= 70 years, prior/concurrent therapy, presence of metastases, and number of cycles completed), was analysed. Results: One hundred patients completed one cycle of Lu-177 PSMA I&T and underwent response assessment by both PSA and PET/CT. Two patients had an uninterpretable week-12 PET/CT. Median age was 70 (50-89), median number of prior therapies was three (1-6), and median follow up was 12-months. Fifty-four percent achieved a PSA response. Disease control rate (DCR) by PET/CT was 64% (29% SD, 34% PR, and 1% CR). Disease control by PET/CT was associated with an improved one-year overall survival (OS) compared to non-responders, median OS not-reached vs 10-months (p < 0.0001; 95% CI: 0.08-0.44). Regarding haematologic toxicity, 11% experienced a grade >= 3 cytopenia (self-limiting). No cases of myelodysplasia /acute leukaemia (MDS/AL) have been recorded. No association with risk factors was demonstrated. Conclusion: Lu-177-PSMA I&T is a safe and effective palliative outpatient treatment for mCRPC. Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT response is associated with an improved one-year OS and may be used to adapt therapy.

Terbium-161 for PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy of prostate cancer	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Tb-161; Auger electrons; Prostate cancer; PSMA ligands; Radioligand therapy	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; LU-177; LIGANDS; DOSIMETRY; DIAGNOSIS; TOXICITY; IN-111; ASSAY; PET	PurposeThe prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has emerged as an interesting target for radionuclide therapy of metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The aim of this study was to investigate Tb-161 (T-1/2=6.89days; E beta(?)(av)=154keV) in combination with PSMA-617 as a potentially more effective therapeutic alternative to Lu-177-PSMA-617, due to the abundant co-emission of conversion and Auger electrons, resulting in an improved absorbed dose profile.Methods(161)Tb was used for the radiolabeling of PSMA-617 at high specific activities up to 100MBq/nmol. Tb-161-PSMA-617 was tested in vitro and in tumor-bearing mice to confirm equal properties, as previously determined for Lu-177-PSMA-617. The effects of Tb-161-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA-617 on cell viability (MTT assay) and survival (clonogenic assay) were compared in vitro using PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor cells. Tb-161-PSMA-617 was further investigated in therapy studies using PC-3 PIP tumor-bearing mice.Results(161)Tb-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA-617 displayed equal in-vitro properties and tissue distribution profiles in tumor-bearing mice. The viability and survival of PC-3 PIP tumor cells were more reduced when exposed to Tb-161-PSMA-617 as compared to the effect obtained with the same activities of Lu-177-PSMA-617 over the whole investigated concentration range. Treatment of mice with Tb-161-PSMA-617 (5.0MBq/mouse and 10MBq/mouse, respectively) resulted in an activity-dependent increase of the median survival (36 vs 65days) compared to untreated control animals (19days). Therapy studies to compare the effects of Tb-161-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA-617 indicated the anticipated superiority of Tb-161 over Lu-177.Conclusion(161)Tb-PSMA-617 showed superior in-vitro and in-vivo results as compared to Lu-177-PSMA-617, confirming theoretical dose calculations that indicate an additive therapeutic effect of conversion and Auger electrons in the case of Tb-161. These data warrant more preclinical research for in-depth investigations of the proposed concept, and present a basis for future clinical translation of Tb-161-PSMA-617 for the treatment of mCRPC.

The onset and offset time constants of metoclopramide action were 1.3 and 2.1 s, respectively. The potency of metoclopramide when exclusively applied during the agonist pulse decreased more than 200-fold (IC50 = 19.0 mu M, peak current suppression). 3 Metoclopramide (0.10 mu M) did not alter the EC50 of 5-HT-induced peak currents. In contrast to the lack of competitive interaction between metoclopramide and 5-HT in this functional assay, metoclopramide inhibited specific [H-3]GR65630 binding to human h5-HT3A receptors in a surmountable manner. This seeming discrepancy between functional studies and radioligand binding experiments may be accounted for by (1) the slow kinetics of inhibition of peak currents by metoclopramide compared with the fast onset and offset kinetics of 5-HT-induced currents and (2) the low efficacy of metoclopramide in inhibiting radioligand binding (e.g. only 20% binding inhibition compared to 79% peak current suppression by 200 nM metoclopramide). 4 At low concentrations (1-10 nM), ergotamine had no effect on 5-HT (30 mu M)-induced peak currents. Above clinical concentrations, ergotamine (> 3 mu M) inhibited them. 5 When both drugs were applied together (0.10 mu M metoclopramide + 0.001 to 0.01 mu M ergotamine), an inhibition of both, peak and integrated current responses was observed. 6 Neither metoclopramide (<= 30 mu M) nor ergotamine (<= 30 mu M) had an effect on the 5-HT reuptake carrier as they did not alter the citalopram-sensitive [H-3]5-HT uptake.

Vanylidilol competitively antagonized (-) isoproterenol-induced positive chronotropic effects, inotropic effects, and tracheal relaxation effects in isolated rat right atria, left atria, and guinea pig tracheal strips in a concentration-dependent manner. Vanylidilol's apparent pA(2) values were 6.36+/-0.08 (right atria), 6.41+/-0.07 (left atria), and 6.31+/-0.06 (trachea). Vanylidilol also produced a competitive antagonism of phenylephrine-induced contraction in the isolated rat aorta with pA(2) values of 6.79+/-0.18. In the radioligand binding assay, vanylidilol inhibited [H-3] CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricle and lung tissues and [H-3] prazosin binding to brain membranes with Ki values of 535.17, 2,066.69, and 431.11, respectively. In isolated rat thoracic aorta, vanylidilol's vasorelaxant effects on phenylephrine (10 mumol/l)-induced contractions were attenuated by removing endothelium and by the presence of L-N-G-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 100 mumol/l), methylene blue (10 mumol/l), 1H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolol[4,3,-a] quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 10 mumol/l), tetraethylammonium (10 mmol/l), glibenclamide (1 mumol/l), apamin (1 mumol/l), and charybdotoxin (0.1 mumol/l). In addition, vanylidilol, in an equally antagonistic activity, inhibited phenylephrine-induced phasic and tonic contractions. Intravenous vanylidilol further reduced mean blood pressure in pentobarbital-anesthetized normotensive Wistar rats in a dose-dependent manner. The oral administration of vanylidilol to conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats had a long-lasting hypotensive effect on the heart rate and decreased it in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, vanylidilol's vasodilator effect can be attributed in part to the release of NO or NO-related substance from vascular endothelium, while the endothelium-independent mechanism involved in vanylidilol's relaxation is probably linked to the activation of the K+ channels and the alpha-adrenoceptor blocking activity in these vessels.

Influence of Piracetam on Brain Receptor Systems in CD-1 Mice with Different Attention Stability Phenotypes	PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY JOURNAL			English	Article						piracetam; attention deficit disorder; NMDA receptor; D-2 receptor; GABA(B) receptor	BINDING; ADHD	The effect of subchronic administration of the nootropic drug piracetam (200 mg/kg, daily for 6 d) on the behavioral parameters of subpopulations of outbred CD-1 mice with different phenotypes of sustained attention to environmental objects was studied in the closed enriched plus-maze (CEPM) test. The drug action was selective in rodents of the attention deficit phenotype (ED-low), and restored the preference for an enriched environment during exploratory behavior relative to the corresponding control. Radioligand analysis ex vivo showed that piracetam at the selected dose and administration protocol increased the density of GABA(B) receptors in the prefrontal cortex of animals of the ED-low subtype without affecting the number of NMDA and D-2 receptors in the studied brain structures. Changes observed in the neuroreceptor profile may indicate significant participation of a GABA-ergic component in the mechanism of piracetam action in experimental pathology of attention.

Deep learning improves utility of tau PET in the study of Alzheimer's disease	ALZHEIMER'S & DEMENTIA: DIAGNOSIS, ASSESSMENT & DISEASE MONITORING			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES; SCANS	Introduction Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging targeting neurofibrillary tau tangles is increasingly used in the study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its utility may be limited by conventional quantitative or qualitative evaluation techniques in earlier disease states. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are effective in learning spatial patterns for image classification. Methods 18F-MK6240 (n = 320) and AV-1451 (n = 446) PET images were pooled from multiple studies. We performed iterations with differing permutations of radioligands, heuristics, and architectures. Performance was compared to a standard region of interest (ROI)-based approach on prediction of memory impairment. We visualized attention of the network to illustrate decision making. Results Overall, models had high accuracy (> 80%) with good average sensitivity and specificity (75% and 82%, respectively), and had comparable or higher accuracy to the ROI standard. Visualizations of model attention highlight known characteristics of tau radioligand binding. Discussion CNNs could improve tau PET's role in early disease and extend the utility of tau PET across generations of radioligands.

Initially, manual synthesis with 1 mg of precursor and pH = 7.8 KOMs elution buffer yielded 85-92% of(18)F-incorporation yields and showed nondecay corrected yields of 15-17%. Fully automatic synthesis showed a nondecay corrected radiochemical yield of 10.7 +/- 0.46%. Owing to low precursor input, the maximum molar activity achieved was 1302.4 +/- 26.4 GBq/mu mol. Our mild(18)F-fluorination procedure showed higher radiochemical yields and molar activity than those by previously used procedures, even with minimized precursor input.

The effect of substitution at third- and fourth-position of 8-phenyl xanthine has also been taken into consideration. The synthesized compounds showed varying binding affinities at different adenosine receptor subtypes (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3)) and also good in vivo bronchospasmolytic activity against histamine aerosol-induced asthma in guinea pigs. Most of the compounds showed maximum affinity toward the A(2A) receptor subtype. The monosubstituted 3-aminoalkoxyl 8-phenyl xanthine with a aminodiethyl moiety (compound 12e) was found to be most potent A(2A)adenosine receptor ligand (K-i = 0.036 mu M) followed by disubstituted 4-aminoalkoxyl-3-methoxy-8-phenyl xanthine (K-i = 0.050 mu M) (compound 10a).

Functional Assay for T4 Lysozyme-Engineered G Protein-Coupled Receptors with an Ion Channel Reporter	STRUCTURE			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PLASMA-MEMBRANE; TRAFFICKING; GPCR	Structural studies of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) extensively use the insertion of globular soluble protein domains to facilitate their crystallization. However, when inserted in the third intracellular loop (i3 loop), the soluble protein domain disrupts their coupling to G proteins and impedes the GPCRs functional characterization by standard G protein-based assays. Therefore, activity tests of crystallization-optimized GPCRs are essentially limited to their ligand binding properties using radioligand binding assays. Functional characterization of additional thermostabilizing mutations requires the insertion of similar mutations in the wild-type receptor to allow G protein-activation tests. We demonstrate that ion channel-coupled receptor technology is a complementary approach for a comprehensive functional characterization of crystallization-optimized GPCRs and potentially of any engineered GPCR. Ligand-induced conformational changes of the GPCRs are translated into electrical signal and detected by simple current recordings, even though binding of G proteins is sterically blocked by the added soluble protein domain.

In particular, positron emission tomography (PET) has contributed to the development of radiolabelled compounds for assessing molecular processes in the living brain. The dynamics of PET typically require a relatively large organ size and blood supply in order to properly evaluate radioligand binding kinetics. To fulfil these requirements, pigs have often been used in such studies. Today, much is known about the metabolism, neurotransmission and molecular binding properties of the living porcine brain, and most findings support similarities between neuronal mechanisms in pigs and humans. Here, we review 10-years of PET findings on neuromolecular processes in the living porcine brain and, whenever possible, we relate PET findings in pigs to those obtained in humans.

This method is based on hydrophilic interaction chromatography utilizing a semi-preparative silica column (10 mm I.D.) and a high volatile organic mobile phase (>90% acetonitrile). In nine different radiopharmaceuticals studied, six compounds could be separated from the unlabeled precursor with good resolution and faster elution than its precursor. These characteristics enabled significant shortening of the separation and evaporation processes in the manufacture of short-lived radiopharmaceuticals. Several (11)C-radiopharmaceuticals could be prepared within one half-life of carbon-11 (20.4 min), including radiosynthesis, purification and formulation steps with sufficient radiochemical/chemical purity and high levels of radioactivity/specific radioactivity.

Imidazoline I-2 receptors are principally expressed on glial cells. Objective: To investigate the feasibility of using the measurement of imidazoline I-2 receptor expression to differentiate glial tumours from other types of brain tumours and for grading the different gliomas. Methods: The specific binding of [H-3]idazoxan to imidazoline I-2 receptors was measured in homogenates from human gliomas of different grades. Results: The density of imidazoline I-2 receptors was significantly greater in the three types of malignant glial tumours than in postmortem control brain or non-glial tumours. The increase in density correlated with the malignancy grade of the gliomas. No significant differences in affinity values were observed. Conclusion: These results suggest that the density of imidazoline I-2 receptors may be a useful radioligand parameter for the differentiation of glial tumours from other types of brain tumours and for grading the different gliomas.

There was no significant difference in the number of DA D-2 receptors in the VaD group as compared with controls. The binding affinity was significantly lower in the VaD group. When the VaD group was subdivided into subjects with or without neuroleptic treatment, there were no differences in the numbers of receptors as compared with controls, and the significant differences in binding affinity remained for both VaD subgroups. The present results are. discussed with reference to the previous finding of a reduced density of caudate nucleus DA uptake sites in the same VaD group and to results from studies on DA D-2 receptors in Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

This is the first report of the hexahydrodibenzopyrans from a higher plant other than the genus Cannabis. The cannabimimetic activity was thus evaluated by radioligand binding assay for cannabinoid receptor CB1, which indicated, notably, that both 1 and 2 were inactive. In addition, the cross reactivity of I and 2 toward antibodies designed for urinary metabolites of cannabinoids was evaluated with the EMIT and On Line cannabinoids; assays. Both compounds showed no response at 100 000 ng/mL in both assays. Machaeriol B (2) demonstrated in vitro antimalarial activity (IC50 = 120 ng/mL) against Plasmodium falciparum W-2 clone.

Meta-iodine substituted 9-fluorenone 5 with high binding affinity (K-i = 9.3 nM) and selectivity was radiolabeled with I-125. Fully in vitro and in vivo studies of [I-125]5 have been performed. [I-125]5 exhibited well brain uptake with a peak concentration of 7.5 +/- 0.9% ID/g in mice brains. Moreover, ex vivo autoradiography studies and micro single-photon emission computed tomography (micro-SPECT/CT) dynamic imaging in mice confirmed its in vivo imaging properties. Besides, molecular docking and MD studies were also performed to interpret the binding mechanisms of the two series of ligands towards alpha 7-nAChRs. To conclude, the meta-iodine substituted 9-fluorenone [I-125]5 could be a promising tracer for imaging alpha 7-nAChRs.

In binding experiments in vitro, 1,3,4-PODP derivatives (3 and 6) displayed high affinity for Ab(1-42) aggregates (25 and 14 nM, respectively). In experiments in vivo, [123/125I] 3 and [123/125I] 6 displayed good initial uptake into and rapid washout from the brain in normal mice, and clearly labeled Ab plaques in Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, specific labeling of Ab plaques was observed in in vitro autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections. These results suggested that 1,3,4-PODP derivatives may be useful SPECT probes for detecting Ab plaques in AD brains.

A synthetic route for the preparation of the title compounds was developed, which includes a copper(I)-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition as the key step. Three bivalent analogues of BIBP-3226 were prepared showing nanomolar antagonistic activity and binding affinity to the NPY Y1 receptor (calcium assay on HEL cells, radioligand binding assay on SK-N-MC cells), but these ligands were not superior to the parent compound and there was no correlation with the length or the chemical nature of the spacer. A trivalent BIBP-3226 derivate showed, surprisingly, no affinity to the NPY Y-1 receptor at all. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the enhanced beta -adrenoceptor-mediated responses to isoprenaline were not caused by an overall increase in density of beta -adrenoceptors, but were accompanied by changes in the ratio of the beta -adrenoceptor subtypes.

This radioligand is internalized into the cell and can induce receptor-specific cytotoxicity by emission of Auger electrons. We hypothesized that high-dose In-111-pentetreotide could be therapeutic in patients with somatostatin receptor-expressing tumors. Our 35-year-old patient had atypical carcinoid tumor metastatic to cervical, supraclavicular, mediastinal, and mesenteric lymph nodes and to the liver and bone. Chemotherapy had stabilized the disease but with severe gastrointestinal side effects. After a diagnostic In-111-pentetreotide scan, the patient was given eight courses (180 mCi each) of In-111-pentetreotide therapy to selectively target somatostatin receptor-expressing tumor cells. The disease was stable for approximately 14 months. The patient had two additional courses of In-111-pentetreotide therapy (360 mCi each). She died of the disease approximately 18 months after initiation of In-111-pentetreotide therapy.

This study aimed to evaluate C-11-SD5024 both in vitro and in vivo and compare it with the other CB, receptor ligands previously used in humans, i.e.,C-11-MePPEP, C-11-OMAR, F-18-MK-9470, and F-18-FMPEP-d(2). In vitro experiments were performed to measure dissociation constant (1(1) in the human brain and to measure the lipophilicity of the five CB, receptor ligands listed above. In vivo specific binding in monkeys was measured by comparing total distribution volume (V-T) at baseline and after full receptor blockade. The kinetics of C-11-SD5024 in humans were evaluated in seven healthy subjects with compartmental modeling. SD5024 showed K-i = 0.47 nM, which was at an intermediate level among the five CB, receptor ligands. Lipophilicity (LogD(7.4)) was 3.79, which is appropriate for brain imaging. Monkey scans showed high proportion of specific binding: -80% of V-T. In humans, C-11-SD5024 showed peak brain uptake of 1.5-3 standardized uptake value, which was slightly higher than that of C-11-OMAR and 18F-MK-9470. One-compartment model showed good fitting, consistent with the vast majority of brain uptake being specific binding found in the monkey. Regional V-T values were consistent with known distribution of CB1 receptors. V-T calculated from 80 and 120 mm of scan data was strongly correlated (R-2 = 0.97), indicating that 80 min provided adequate information for quantitation and that the influence of radiometabolites was low. Intersubject variability for V-T of C-11-SD5024 was 22%, which was low among the five radioligands and indicated precise measurement. In conclusion, C-11-SD5024 has appropriate affinity and lipophilicity, high specific binding, moderate brain uptake, and provides good precision to measure the binding. The results suggest that C-11-SD5024 is slightly better than or equivalent to C-11-OMAR and that both are suitable for clinical studies, especially those that involve two scans in one day.

The aims of this study were to i) investigate the expression profile of HTR4 in adult and fetal lung tissue and cultured airway cells, ii) further define HTR4 gene structure and iii) explore the potential functional implications of key SNPs using a bioinformatic approach. Methods: Following reverse transcription (RT)-PCR in human brain, 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RACE) was used to examine the exonic structure of HTR4 at the 5' end. Quantitative (Q)-PCR was used to quantify HTR4 mRNA expression in total RNA from cultured airway cells and whole lung tissue. Publically available gene microarray data on fetal samples of estimated gestational age 7-22 weeks were mined for HTR4 expression. Immunohistochemistry (IHC; in adult and fetal lung tissue) and a radioligand binding assay (in cultured airway cells) were used to analyze 5HT(4)R protein expression. Results: IHC in adult lung, irrespective of the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), suggested low level expression of 5-HT4R protein, which was most prominent in alveolar pneumocytes. There was evidence of differential 5-HT4R protein levels during gestation in fetal lung, which was also evident in gene expression microarray data. HTR4 mRNA expression, assessed by Q-PCR, was <0.5% relative to brain in total adult lung tissue and in human airway smooth muscle (HASM) and bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) derived from adult donors. Radioligand binding experiments also indicated that HBEC and HASM cells did not express a significant 5-HT4R population. 5' RACE in brain identified a novel N-terminal variant, containing an extended N-terminal sequence. The functional significance of key HTR4 SNPs was investigated using the encyclopedia of DNA elements consortium (ENCODE) dataset. These analyses identified multiple alterations in regulatory motifs for transcription factors implicated in lung development, including Foxp1. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest a role for HTR4 in lung development, which may at least in part explain the genetic association with lung function.

This receptor-ligand system is involved in various physiological as well as pathophysiological mechanisms, but owing to the peptidic structure, it is rapidly degraded by enzymes. The enzymatic digestion of nociceptin involves mainly aminopeptidases and yields Noc(2-17)-OH and other smaller fragments. We aimed at increasing the enzymatic stability against aminopeptidases in the case of peptide Noc(1-13)-NH2, which possesses the minimum sequence capable of interacting with the NOP receptor. Therefore we developed a new procedure for the synthesis of peptides with the carbamic acid residue [center dot center dot center dot-NH-CH(R)-CO-NH-CO-NH-CH(Q)-CO-center dot center dot center dot]. A set of four carbamic acid-nociceptin derivatives were produced. The carbamic acid residue was incorporated into the inner part of the peptides, building on solid phase, by using a suitable dipeptide fragment with carbamic acid residue produced by a simple and efficient three-step solution phase procedure. Enzymatic stability of carbamic acid peptides was studied in the presence of aminopeptidase M (AP-M) and in rat brain membrane homogenate. The receptor-binding properties were also studied by radioligand binding assay on crude rat brain membranes and the activity of the ligands were analyzed on isolated mouse vas deferens (MVD) tissues. We found that incorporation of the carbamic acid residue into the N-terminal part of nociceptin significantly increases the resistance against AP-M. We observed the decrease of binding affinities to the NOP receptor in case of the peptides modified in the N-terminal portion. Consequently, the incorporation of the carbamic acid residue into peptides can be proposed as a promising and reasonable tool for increasing enzymatic stability, where the native molecule is less sensitive for carbamic acid residue-related structural change.

However, anaesthetics can modify radioligand binding profiles at receptor targets studied by positron emission tomography (PET). Here, we determined the effects of two routine anaesthetics on the binding of a tracer of the serotonin 5HT(2A) receptors. Procedures Isoflurane- and propofol-anesthetised Gottingen minipigs were imaged with [C-11]MDL100,907 PET and analysed using regions of interest and statistical non-parametric mapping. Results The binding potentials of the tracer in striatum under isoflurane anaesthesia significantly exceeded those obtained under propofol anaesthesia, an effect we attribute to the higher blood flow in brain induced by the former. Conclusions Interactions between radioligands and anaesthesia must be carefully evaluated in the design of in vivo neuroimaging and interpretation of data.

The Emergence of Theranostics in the Philippines: Overcoming Challenges and Bringing Hope	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Theranostics; Ga-68; Lu-177 DOTATATE; Ga-68; Lu-177 PSMA; Philippines; Pioneer	RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY	Medical managements are becoming personalized while diseases are being understood at the molecular level. Nuclear medicine is one of the fields actively contributing to this development. In particular, theranostics, a combinatorial term for therapy and diagnostics, enables accurate imaging and subsequent targeted radionuclide treatment. Due to its high impact in healthcare, many countries have begun to offer Ga-68 PET/CT scans and Lu-177 therapies. The Philippines has followed suit through the initiative of this author and able support of the administration and staff of St. Luke's Medical Center. The Ga-68 DOTATATE and PSMA PET/CT scans became officially available in January 2018 while the first peptide receptor radionuclide therapy for neuroendocrine tumor and first PSMA radioligand therapy for prostate cancer occurred in May and June 2018, respectively. Amidst past, present, and future challenges, theranostics has emerged in the Philippines, offering hope to cancer patients in the country.

A better in-depth knowledge of peptidic receptor has permitted more extensive research and development of new radioligands. The different published studies showed the interest of radiolabelled peptide development but also the difficulties to obtain a radiopharmaceutical with pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties adapted to clinical applications in diagnosis and internal radiotherapy. Based on the literature, the most applied methodology is to modify the structure of the endogenous ligand iteratively and to synthesize various derivatives radiolabelled peptide tested one by one. We chose to address the issue of optimization of radiolabelled peptide analogues from a different recent method via molecular modelling and for our purpose more specifically the targeting of the peptide receptor cholecystokinin/gastrin.

Although the biomolecular mechanism of this overexpression must be elucidated, sigma(2) receptor was considered a potential biomarker for monitoring solid tumour proliferation. In this study, we verified first sigma(2) receptor overexpression by saturation analysis with radioligand in six human bladder cancer specimens, then if a possible correlation could be established between sigma(2) overexpression and tumour tissue stage and grade. The results displayed that sigma(2) receptor protein was normally expressed in human bladder and overexpressed in the case of high-grade transitional cell carcinomas. Moreover, these receptors were undetected in a low-grade squamous cell carcinoma and in a very rare form of anaplastic, large cells plasmacytoid cancer. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Design, synthesis and cardiovascular evaluation of some aminoisopropanoloxy derivatives of xanthone	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Xanthone; Synthesis; Cardiovascular; Adrenoceptor; Hypertension; Arrhythmia	PIPERAZINE DERIVATIVES; BETA-BLOCKERS; AMINOALKANOL DERIVATIVES; ANTAGONISTIC PROPERTIES; VASORELAXING ACTIVITIES; AFFINITY; ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR; BETA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR; HYPERTENSION; SERIES	A series of aminoisopropanoloxy derivatives of xanthone has been synthesized and their pharmacological properties regarding the cardiovascular system has been evaluated. Radioligand binding and functional studies in isolated organs revealed that title compounds present high affinity and antagonistic potency for alpha(1)-(compound 2 and 8), beta-(compounds 1, 3, 4, 7), alpha(1)/beta-(compounds 5 and 6) adrenoceptors. Furthermore, compound 7, the structural analogue of verapamil, possesses calcium entry blocking activity. The title compounds showed hypotensive and antiarrhythmic properties due to their adrenoceptor blocking effect. Moreover, they did not affect QRS and QT intervals, and they did not have proarrhythmic potential at tested doses. In addition they exerted anti-aggregation effect. The results of this study suggest that new compounds with multidirectional activity in cardiovascular system might be found in the group of xanthone derivatives. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Acylation of the 2-amino group was found to be crucial for high A(1) affinity. The best compound of the present series was 2-benzoylamino-5-p-methylbenzoyl-4-phenylthiazole (16m) showing a K-i value of 4.83 nM at rat and 57.4 nM at human A(1) receptors combined with high selectivity versus the other AdoR subtypes. The compound behaved as an antagonist in GTP shift assays at A(1) receptors. Compound 16m may serve as a new lead structure for the development of second-generation non-xanthine-derived A(1) antagonists which have potential as novel drugs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Among them, derivatives of 3S-(-)-4 such as 3a, 3f, and 3g which had certain zwitterionic anilides showed high affinity to the NMDA-glycine binding site. The absolute configuration of 3S-(-)-4 was confirmed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In particular, 3g (SM-31900) was found to be a highly active glycine antagonist for both in vitro and in vivo assays (Ki = 1.0 +/- 0.1 nM, ED50 = 2.3 mg/kg, iv) and also showed high selectivity for the glycine site. In addition, 3g was soluble enough in aqueous media (> 10 mg/mL at pH 7.4) to use for medications by intravenous injection.

In the present study, using [H-3]cytisine as a radioligand, we observed a significant 30% decrease in post-mortem striatum of patients with schizophrenia (n = 12) as compared to controls (n = 12). A 25% decrease of striatal alpha 4 beta 2 receptor density in patients with Parkinson's syndrome (n = 12) was not significant. As an upregulation of alpha 4 beta 2 receptors has been observed due to nicotine consumption, the beneficial effects of nicotine described in patients with schizophrenia may be partly due to a compensation for a decrease in alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

Our results showed the existence of a homogenous population of high affinity binding sites for H-3-mepyramine (B-max = 281 fmol/mg protein, K-D = 3.5 +/- 0.7 nM) and H-3-tiotidine (B-max = 59 fmol/mg protein, K-D = 1.9 +/- 0.7 nM) on astrocytes, which was further confirmed by competition binding studies using various H1 and H2 specific agonists/antagonists. We showed differences in the density of receptors and differences in the affinities of competing drugs for the same histamine receptor subtype (H1 and H2) between the tissues used, which indicate different molecular properties of the central and peripheral histamine receptors.

Typical and atypical carcinoids are low-grade NETs of the lung. They present a favorable prognosis comported to the more common high-grade NETs. The low-and high-grade NETs require different treatment strategies; effective management of these tumors is essential to prolong survival and to manage the symptoms in patients with secretory or functional tumors. These rare tumors have received little attention and education is needed for treating physicians. This mini-review will concentrate mainly on advanced low-grade lung NETs. The article describes the classification of lung NETs and the diagnostic work-up. Different treatment methods including somatostatin analogs, peptide receptor radioligand therapy, and biologic systemic therapy are discussed. Promising results from recent trials are presented and discussed in the context of the lung primary site.

The most interesting and potent compound in this series was 6a, which showed an ED50 = 3.5 mu g, a value about 3-fold higher with respect to morphine by the same route of administration. When administered per os, 6a was 4-fold more potent than morphine in the same test, suggesting it significant bioavailability. The same compound also showed high potency in the hot plate test. The antinociceptive effect of 6a was completely reversed by pretreatment with yohimbine both in the hot plate test and in the tail flick test. This demonstrated the involvement of the adrenergic system, which was confirmed by in vitro radioligand binding studies.

Gallium-68-(Ga-68) PSMA positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging is a game-changer in the management of prostate cancer. 68Ga PSMA PET/CT scan is advanced and a promising radioligand has high sensitivity in determining lesions of prostate cancer with a high tumor to background ratio. The most common areas of metastasis are the bone and pelvic lymph nodes. The prognosis of prostate cancer is mainly determined by the status of metastases. The presence and the localization of metastases affects treatment planning. In our cases, we presented some examples of uncommon sites of metastases such as the brain, adrenal glands, penis and orbit. Improvements in imaging techniques, such as Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT have led to the possibility to make more determination of rare metastase sites in prostate cancer patients.

Dopamine neurotransmission in cortical brain regions has been suggested to be of importance for higher-order cognitive processes. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between extrastriatal dopamine D2-R availability and cognitive function, using positron emission tomography and the high-affinity D2-R radioligand [C-11]FLB 457, in an antipsychotic-naive sample of 18 first-episode psychosis patients and 16 control subjects. We observed no significant associations between D2-R binding in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex or hippocampus (beta = 0.013-0.074, partial r= -0.037-0.273, p = 0.131-0.841). Instead, using Bayesian statistics, we found moderate support for the null hypothesis of no relationship (BFH0:H1 = 3.3-8.2). Theoretically, our findings may suggest a lack of detrimental effects of D2-R antagonist drugs on cognition in schizophrenia patients, in line with clinical observations.

[Cu-64]NOTA-PA1 was obtained with high specific activity, high radiochemical purity, and good stability. Cell uptake of [64Cu]NOTA-PA1 was higher than that of [Cu-64]DOTA-TATE in MCF-7, A549, BGC823, and HT-29 cell lines. [64Cu]NOTA-PA1 showed high binding affinity for SSTRs expressed in A549 cells. The in vivo biodistribution and micropositron emission tomography (micro-PET) imaging studies of [64Cu]NOTA-PA1 revealed good detection ability in MCF-7 and A549 xenografted nude mice. The radiosynthesis, quality control, and preliminary biological evaluation of [Cu-64]NOTA-PA1 have broaden the application of radiolabeled octreotide for SSTRs imaging, which could act as a potential multisubtypes targeted radiotracer for imaging SSTRs-positive tumors.

Imperatorin displayed similar chromatographic retention peak to verapamil in the model of cardiac muscle/cell membrane chromatography, and could reduce in a concentration-dependent way protein content and cell size of myocytes prestimulated with angiotensin II. The ratio of heart weight to body weight (mg/g) (4.13 +/- 0.06 in SHRs, 3.77 +/- 0.02 with imperatorin 25 mg kg(-1) d(-1) 16 17 ig, P<0.01) was significantly lower in the imperatorin-treated SHRs.

Within each series, binding experiments showed compounds with good affinity demonstrating high percentage displacement values at 1 mu M. The most potent of these (20) had a pK(i) of 8.54 demonstrating very good affinity. These indole analogues were combined with 55 ligands that were previously produced in our laboratory to explore the structure-activity relationships of these 5-HT4 ligands. A CoMFA (Comparative Molecular Field Analysis) analysis was used to extend an earlier simple pharmacophore to suggest two new molecular features beyond the primary amino binding site. The pharmacophore confirmed that a newly described tetrahydroquinoline analogue was able to match the basic requirements of the model and the pharmacology of this molecule is provided in more detail.

We studied the effects of STN microinjections of the serotonin-2 (5-HT2) antagonists clozapine, mesulergine and M100,907 on apomorphine-induced stereotypic activity in the rat. Each compound profoundly decreased the expression of stereotypic behavior, with particularly strong effects to reduce gnawing behavior. Because M100,907 does not have appreciable affinity for dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors, and since all three agents are 5-HT2 antagonists, the current data suggest that basal ganglia output related to orofacial movements can be significantly modified by 5-HT2 receptors. The results suggest that antipsychotics with serotonergic properties may have direct actions on the STN that influence their potential to produce orofacial and other motor side effects.

Radiosynthesis and First-In-Human PET/MRI Evaluation with Clinical-Grade [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FTC-146	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Radiopharmaceuticals; [F-18]FTC-146; Automated radiosynthesis; Clinical; PET/MRI; sigma-1 receptor	SIGMA-1 RECEPTOR RADIOLIGAND; POTENTIAL TARGETS; PET; LIGANDS; EXPRESSION; COCAINE	Sigma-1 receptors (S1Rs) play an important role in many neurological disorders. Simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with S1R radioligands may provide valuable information for diagnosing and guiding treatment for these diseases. Our previously reported S1R radioligand, [F-18]FTC-146, demonstrated high affinity for the S1R (K (i) = 0.0025 nM) and excellent selectivity for the S1R over the sigma-2 receptor (S2Rs; K (i) = 364 nM) across several species (from mouse to non-human primate). Herein, we report the clinical-grade radiochemistry filed with exploratory Investigational New Drug (eIND) and first-in-human PET/MRI evaluation of [F-18]FTC-146. [F-18]FTC-146 is prepared via a direct [F-18] fluoride nucleophilic radiolabeling reaction and formulated in 0.9 % NaCl containing no more than 10 % ethanol through sterile filtration. Quality control (QC) was performed based on USP 823 before doses were released for clinical use. The safety and whole body biodistribution of [F-18]FTC-146 were evaluated using a simultaneous PET/MR scanner in two representative healthy human subjects. [F-18]FTC-146 was synthesized with a radiochemical yield of 3.3 +/- 0.7 % and specific radioactivity of 8.3 +/- 3.3 Ci/mu mol (n = 10, decay corrected to EOB). Both radiochemical and chemical purities were > 95 %; the prepared doses were stable for 4 h at ambient temperature. All QC test results met specified clinical criteria. The in vivo PET/MRI investigations showed that [F-18]FTC-146 rapidly crossed the blood brain barrier and accumulated in S1R-rich regions of the brain. There were also radioactivity distributed in the peripheral organs, i.e., the lungs, spleen, pancreas, and thyroid. Furthermore, insignificant uptake of [F-18]FTC-146 was observed in cortical bone and muscle. A reliable and automated radiosynthesis for providing routine clinical-grade [F-18]FTC-146 for human studies was established in a modified GE TRACERlab FXFN. PET/MRI demonstrated the initial tracer biodistribution in humans, and clinical studies investigating different S1R-related diseases are in progress.

Quantification of Beta Adrenergic Receptor Subtypes in Beta-Arrestin Knockout Mouse Airways	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SMOOTH-MUSCLE; GUINEA-PIG; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; I-125 IODOCYANOPINDOLOL; ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; ASTHMA PHENOTYPE; ISOLATED TRACHEA; MURINE MODEL; HUMAN-LUNG	In allergic asthma Beta 2 adrenergic receptors (beta(2)ARs) are important mediators of bronch-orelaxation and, paradoxically, asthma development. This contradiction is likely due to the activation of dual signaling pathways that are downstream of G proteins or beta-arrestins. Our group has recently shown that beta-arrestin-2 acts in its classical role to desensitize and constrain beta(2)AR-induced relaxation of both human and murine airway smooth muscle. To assess the role of beta-arrestins in regulating beta(2)AR function in asthma, we and others have utilized beta-arrestin-1 and -2 knockout mice. However, it is unknown if genetic deletion of beta-arrestins in these mice influences beta(2)AR expression in the airways. Furthermore, there is lack of data on compensatory expression of beta AR subtypes when either of the beta-arrestins is genetically deleted, thus necessitating a detailed beta AR subtype expression study in these beta-arrestin knockout mice. Here we standardized a radioligand binding methodology to characterize and quantitate beta AR subtype distribution in the airway smooth muscle of wild-type C57BL/6J and beta-arrestin-1 and beta-arrestin-2 knockout mice. Using complementary competition and single-point saturation binding assays we found that beta(2)ARs predominate over beta(1)ARs in the whole lung and epithelium-denuded tracheobronchial smooth muscle of C57BL/6J mice. Quantification of beta AR subtypes in beta-arrestin-1 and beta-arrestin-2 knockout mouse lung and epithelium-denuded tracheobronchial tissue showed that, similar to the C57BL/6J mice, both knockouts display a predominance of beta(2)AR expression. These data provide further evidence that beta(2)ARs are expressed in greater abundance than beta(1)ARs in the tracheobronchial smooth muscle and that loss of either beta-arrestin does not significantly affect the expression or relative proportions of beta(2)AR subtypes. As beta-arrestins are known to modulate beta(2)AR function, our analysis of beta AR subtype expression in beta-arrestin knockout mice airways sets a reference point for future studies exploiting these knockout mice in various disease models including asthma.

((R)-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-[C-11]-methyl-N-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline caboxamide ([C-11]-(R)-PK11195) has been widely used for PET imaging of TSPO and, despite its low specific-to-nondisplaceable binding ratio, increased TSPO binding has been shown in AD patients. The high-affinity radioligand N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl-5-methoxybenzyl) acetamide ([F-18] FEDAA1106) has been developed as a potential in vivo imaging tool for better quantification of TSPO binding. The aim of this study was to quantify in vivo binding of [F-18] FEDAA1106 to TSPO in control subjects and AD patients. Methods Seven controls (five men, twowomen, age 68 +/- 3 years, MMSE score 29 +/- 1) and nine AD patients (six men, three women, age 69 +/- 4 years, MMSE score 25 +/- 3) were studied with [F-18] FEDAA1106. PET measurements were performed on an ECAT EXACT HR system (Siemens Medical Solutions) in two 60-min dynamic PET sessions with a 30-min interval between sessions. Arterial blood radioactivity was measured using an automated blood sampling system for the first 5 min and using manually drawn samples thereafter. Quantification was performed using both kinetic analysis based on a two-tissue compartment model and Logan graphical analysis. Outcome measures were total distribution volume (V-T) and binding potential (BPND=k(3)/k(4)). An estimate of nondisplaceable distribution volume was obtained with the Logan graphical analysis using the first 15 min of PET measurements (V-ND (1-15 min)). Binding potential (BPND) was also calculated as: V-T/VND 1-15 min-1. Results No statistically significant differences in V-T, k(3)/k(4) or BPND were observed between controls and AD patients. Conclusion This study suggests that TSPO imaging with [F-18] FEDAA1106 does not enable the detection of microglial activation in AD.

The use of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) radioligands has represented an important advance in both in the diagnosis by positron emission tomography (PET) molecular imaging and the treatment of advanced stages of the disease. This article reviews the contribution of PET studies with PSMA radioligands in the initial staging, tumor detection in biochemical recurrence (elevation of PSA) after treatment with curative intent, and in the more advanced stages of the disease (castration-resistant PC [CRPC]). The contribution of PSMA radioligand therapy in CRPC patients who progress to standard therapy is also analyzed.(c) 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

PSMA PET applications in the prostate cancer journey: from diagnosis to theranostics	WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article						PSMA; PET; Prostate cancer; Staging; Theranostics; Lutetium	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; ADENOCARCINOMA; SENSITIVITY; TOMOGRAPHY; GA-68-PSMA; ACCURACY; LIGAND; SAFETY; MRI	The heterogeneity of prostate cancer has made imaging modalities of crucial importance in this disease. Accurate diagnosis and staging of the volume and extent of disease, especially in advanced and metastatic prostate cancer, can help to tailor the timing and modalities of treatment. While MRI has been effective in the detection of significant prostate cancer, its use in the identification and quantification of extraprostatic disease is limited. This gap is now being filled by PSMA PET. PSMA PET scans have now been shown to have a role in all stages in the prostate cancer journey. Emerging evidence has shown its promise in primary staging, restaging and theranostics. In this paper, we review the evidence for the use of PSMA PET in the various stages of prostate cancer, from initial diagnosis to advanced metastatic disease where other systemic treatments have failed.

We recently reported the development of an F-18-based pretargeting strategy predicated on the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction as well as the use of this approach to visualize pancreatic tumor tissue in vivo as early as 1 h postinjection. Herein, we report a comprehensive structure: pharmacokinetic relationship study of a library of 25 novel radioligands that aims to identify radiotracers with optimal pharmacokinetic and dosimetric properties. This investigation revealed key relationships between molecular structure and in vivo behavior and produced two lead candidates exhibiting rapid tumor targeting with high target-to-background activity concentration ratios at early time points. We believe this knowledge to be of high value for the design and clinical translation of next-generation pretargeting agents for the diagnosis and treatment of disease.

EM-2 was modified by connecting nitrogen atoms of both phenylalanine residues by a methylene bridge. The obtained analog did not bind to the A mu- or delta-opioid receptors in the in vitro studies. The computational analysis of this analog showed twisted, type IV turns and the absence of canonical beta-turns typical for the EM-2 structure, which can be explained by the lack of hydrogen bonds involving Phe(4). Our results show that the introduction of chemical constraint in the EM-2 structure has a significant effect on opioid receptor affinity and in vitro bioactivity.

A significant increase in NMDA receptor density above control values was found bilaterally in BA22 in schizophrenia, but not in BA10. The effect was greatest in those patients described as primarily type II, in whom the effect was significantly lateralized, with a greater elevation in the left hemisphere. A significant decrease in NMDA receptor density was found in rat frontal cortex following chronic antipsychotic drug administration, indicating that prior drug treatment was unlikely to have contributed to the differences in schizophrenia.

Method: [C-11]FLB 457, a high-affinity radioligand for extrastriatal D-2-like receptors, and a three-dimensional positron emission tomography system were used to measure D-2-like receptor binding potentials in frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus in 12 healthy men and 12 healthy women. Results: Women had higher D-2-like receptor binding potentials than men in the three brain regions studied, and the difference in the frontal cortex was statistically significant. In a more detailed regional analysis, the difference between the sexes was most pronounced for the left and right anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: This study provides in vivo evidence for a gender difference in dopamine D-2-like receptor levels, which could be reflected in gender-associated differences in clinical disorders linked to the dopamine system.

Responses to purinergic nerve stimulation are resistant to PIT. PIT is an allosteric modulator of responses to ATP in recombinant P2Y(1) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes with potentiation of ATP at low concentrations (0.1-10 mu M) and antagonism at higher ones (>10 mu M). A radioligand binding profile showed that PIT did not interact with any other receptors, with the exception of low affinity for the adenosine A(1) receptor (pK(i), 5.3). The compound recognises purine sites and then may cause irreversible binding to sulfhydryl groups following prolonged incubation or high concentrations. PIT is a potent spin trapper.

In this study, we present the radiolabeling method of PSMA-617 and PSMA-I&T with the long-lived positron emitter Zr-89 to enable PET imaging up to 7 days post-injection. We compared the biodistribution of Zr-89-PSMA-617 and Zr-89-PSMA-I&T to those of Lu-177-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA-I&T, respectively, in a PSMA(+) xenograft model. Moreover, we provide the first human Zr-89-PSMA-617 images. Materials and methods PSMA ligands were labeled with 50-55 MBq [Zr-89]ZrCl4 using a two-step labeling protocol. For biodistribution, BALB/c nude mice bearing PSMA(+) and PSMA(-) xenografts received 0.6 mu g (0.6-1 MBq) of Zr-89-PSMA-617, Zr-89-PSMA-I&T, Lu-177-PSMA-617, or Lu-177-PSMA-I&T intravenously. Ex vivo biodistribution and PET/SPECT imaging were performed up to 168 h post-injection. Dosimetry was performed from the biodistribution data. The patient received 90.5 MBq Zr-89-PSMA-617 followed by PET/CT imaging. Results Zr-89-labeled PSMA ligands showed a comparable ex vivo biodistribution to its respective Lu-177-labeled counterparts with high tumor accumulation in the PSMA(+) xenografts. However, using a dose estimation model for Lu-177, absorbed radiation dose in bone and kidneys differed among the Lu-177-PSMA and Zr-89-PSMA tracers. Zr-89-PSMA-617 PET in the first human patient showed high contrast of PSMA expressing tissues up to 48 h post-injection. Conclusion PSMA-617 and PSMA-I&T were successfully labeled with Zr-89 and demonstrated high uptake in PSMA(+) xenografts, which enabled PET up to 168 h post-injection. The biodistribution of Zr-89-PSMA-I&T and Zr-89-PSMA-617 resembled that of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T and Lu-177-PSMA-617, respectively. The first patient Zr-89-PSMA-617 PET images were of high quality warranting further clinical investigation.	[Prive, Bastiaan M.; Derks, Yvonne H. W.; Franssen, Gerben M.; Peters, Steffie M.

This study aims to investigate occurrence, severity and reversibility of hematotoxic adverse events in patients undergoing RLT with Lu-177-PSMA-617 for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). The contribution of pretreatment risk factors and cumulative treatment activity is taken into account specifically.MethodsRLT was performed in 140 patients receiving a total of 497 cycles. A mean activity of 6.9 1.3 GBq Lu-177-PSMA-617 per cycle was administered, and mean cumulative activity was 24.6 15.9 GBq. Hematological parameters were measured at baseline, prior to each treatment course, 2 to 4 weeks thereafter and throughout follow-up. Toxicity was graded based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v5.0.Results Significant (grade >= 3) hematologic adverse events occurred in 13 (9.3%) patients, with anemia in 10 (7.1%), leukopenia in 5 (3.6%) and thrombocytopenia in 6 (4.3%). Hematotoxicity was reversible to grade <= 2 through a median follow-up of 8 (IQR 9) months in all but two patients who died from disease progression within less than 3 months after RLT. Myelosuppression was significantly more frequent in patients with pre-existing grade 2 cytopenia (OR: 3.50, 95%CI 1.08-11.32, p=0.04) or high bone tumor burden (disseminated or diffuse based on PROMISE miTNM, OR: 5.08, 95%CI 1.08-23.86, p=0.04). Previous taxane-based chemotherapy was associated with an increased incidence of significant hematotoxicity (OR: 4.62, 95%CI 1.23-17.28, p=0.02), while treatment with Ra-223-dichloride, cumulative RLT treatment activity and activity per cycle were not significantly correlated (p=0.93, 0.33, 0.29).Conclusion Hematologic adverse events after RLT have an acceptable overall incidence and are frequently reversible. High bone tumor burden, previous taxane-based chemotherapy and pretreatment grade 2 cytopenia may be considered as risk factors for developing clinically relevant myelosuppression, whereas cumulative RLT activity and previous Ra-223-dichloride treatment show no significant contribution to incidence rates.

Its binding was saturable (K-D=0.056 nM) with a B-max (3.65 pmol mg(-1)) significantly higher than that of two other selective 5-HT1A radioligands: the partial agonist, [H-3]-S15535 (2.77 pmol mg(-1)) and the agonist, [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT (2.02 pmol mg(-1)). 2 The influence of GTP gammaS (100 muM) on the binding affinity of 15 serotonergic agonists, partial agonists, antagonists and inverse agonists was investigated in competition binding experiments with [H-3]-WAY100,635. 3 Agonists. including 5-HT, 8-OH-DPAT and buspirone, displayed biphasic isotherms which shifted to the right in the presence of GTP gammaS. In contrast, isotherms of the inverse agonists, methiothepin, (+)butaclamol and spiperone, were shifted to the left in the presence of GTP gammaS. Unlabelled WAY100,635 was the only ligand that was unaffected by GTP gammaS, consistent with 'neutral' antagonist properties. 4 The magnitude of affinity changes induced by GTP gammaS for 13 ligands was highly correlated (r = 0.98) with their efficacy (positive and negative) previously determined by [S-35]GTP gammaS binding. 5 In contrast, the napthylpiperazine derivative and high efficacy agonist, S14506. displayed only a modest GTP gammaS shift, in accordance with previous indications of 'atypical' binding properties of this ligand. A further full agonist, S14671, which is chemically closely-related to S14506, also displayed a minimal GTP gammaS shift, underpinning this observation. 6 In conclusion, [H-3]-WAY100,635 constitutes a useful neutral antagonist radioligand for the characterization of drug actions at h5-HT1A receptors. GTP gammaS-induced affinity changes of agonist and inverse agonist competition isotherms generally correlate well with ligand efficacy, with the notable exception of two chemically-similar agents, S14506 and S14671, which are efficacious agonists, yet relatively insensitive to h5-HT1A receptor/G-protein coupling changes.

Herein, we describe the design, synthesis, photocharacterization, molecular docking, and in vitro characterization of "photo-rimonabant", i.e., azo-derivatives of the selective hCB(1)R antagonist SR1411716A (rimonabant). By applying azo-extension strategies, we yielded compound 16a, which shows marked affinity for CB1R (K-i (cis form) = 29 nM), whose potency increases by illumination with ultraviolet light (CB1R K(i)trans/cis ratio = 15.3). Through radioligand binding, calcium mobilization, and cell luminescence assays, we established that 16a is highly selective for hCB(1)R over hCB(2)R. These selective antagonists can be valuable molecular tools for optical modulation of CBRs and better understanding of disorders associated with the endocannabinoid system.

We previously identified the membrane-spanning protein GPR44 as highly expressed and specific to the beta cells of the pancreas. The selective GPR44 antagonist MK-7246 was radiolabeled with carbon-11 and the resulting positron-emission tomography (PET) tracer [C-11]MK-7246 was evaluated in a pig model and in vitro cell lines. The [C-11]MK-7246 compound demonstrated mainly hepatobiliary excretion with a clearly defined pancreas, no spillover from adjacent tissues, and pancreatic binding similar in magnitude to the previously evaluated GPR44 radioligand [C-11]AZ12204657. The binding could be blocked by preadministration of nonradioactive MK-7246, indicating a receptor-binding mechanism. [C-11]MK-7246 showed strong potential as a PET ligand candidate for visualization of beta-cell mass (BCM) and clinical translation of this methodology is ongoing.

This approach is particularly suited to high-grade prostatic tumors, metastases and tumors resistant to antihormonal therapy, in which there is an overexpression of PSMA. The first results obtained with iodine-131, lutetium-177 or actinium-225 are very encouraging in showing significant rates of response from the first dose on the basis of a decrease in the PSA level and PET/CT imaging with PSMA-Ga-68. These results are all the more promising since they were obtained in patients with a terminal stage presenting large tumor masses with an increased resistance acquired after the failure of the previous treatments, accelerated cell repopulation phenomena in the insufficiently treated foci and heterogeneity of PSMA expression.

These compounds could be separated into two families according to their pharmacological profile: CCK2A or CCK2B. The conformational space of each compound was explored using molecular dynamics simulations and their structural properties were investigated. Our results suggest the occurrence of two families of conformations, extended and folded. Furthermore, this study brings out a possible correspondence between the CCK2 pharmacological profile and the conformational behaviour of the compounds analysed. A model of preferential conformation is proposed for each compound. This work may provide a key to understand the mechanisms underlying the heterogeneity of CCK2 receptor-associated pharmacological effects. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

A suitable radiotracer will advance our understanding of SI PR2 pathophysiology of diseases. The objective of this study is to evaluate the potential of iodine-125 labeled [I-125]TZ6544 to be used for screening new compounds binding toward S1PR2, and assessing the changes of S1PR2 expression in the kidney of streptozotodn-induced diabetic rats. Methods: [I-125]TZ6544 was synthesized from borate precursor by copper (II)-catalyzed iodization reaction with [I-125]Nal. [I-125]TZ6544 was characterized using human recombinant SI PR2 cell membrane and biodistribution studies of [I-125]TZ6544 were performed on Wistar rats that were euthanized at 5 and 30 min post-injection. A rat model of diabetes was induced by IV injection of streptozotocin (55 mg/kg). In vitro autoradiography studies, immunostaining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis were performed in both diabetic and control rats. Results: Radiosynthesis of [I-125]TZ6544 was achieved successfully with good radiochemical yields of similar to 47% and high radiochemical purity of >99%. [I-125]TZ6544 is a potent ligand in vitro for S1PR2 with K-d value of 4.31 nM. [I-125]TZ6544 and [P-32]-labeled endogenous S1P provided comparable IC50 values in radioactive competitive binding assays against known S1PR2 ligands. Compared to control, the kidney of diabetic rats had increased uptake of 544 which could be reduced by a S1PR2 antagonist, JTE-013. lmmunostaining and ELISA analysis confirmed that the diabetic rat had increased S1PR2 expression in the kidney. Conclusions: [I-125]TZ6544 was synthesized successfully in high yields, and in vitro evaluation suggested [I-125]TZ6544 has high potential to be used for screening new S1PR2 compounds and investigating the pathophysiology of S1PR2 functions. The availability of [I-125]TZ6544 may facilitate the development of therapeutics and imaging agents targeting S1PR2. Advances in knowledge: [I-125]TZ6544 showed increased expression of S1PR2 in diabetic rat kidney and can be used to determine binding potency of S1PR2 compounds. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is currently no suitable positron emission tomography (PET) or Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) radioligands for imaging alpha 7 nAChRs in brain.

Method: I-131-CHIBA-1001 was radiosynthesized by chloramine-T method. Different conditions of reaction time and temperature were tested to get a better radiolabeling yield. Radiolabeling yield and radiochemical purities of I-131-CHIBA1001 were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system. Whole body biodistribution study was performed at different time points post injection of I-131-CHIBA-1001 in KM mice. Monkey subject was used for in vivo SPECT imaging in brain. Result: The radiolabeling yield of I-131-CHIBA-1001 reached 96% within 1.5 similar to 2.0 h at 90 similar to 95 degrees C. The radiochemical purity reached more than 99% after HPLC purification. I-131-CHIBA-1001 was highly stable in saline and fresh human serum in room temperature and 37 degrees C separately. The biodistribution data of brain at 15, 30, and 60 min were 11.05 +/- 1.04%ID/g, 8.8 +/- 0.04%ID/g and 6.28 +/- 1.13%ID/g, respectively. In experimental SPECT imaging, the distribution of radioactivity in the brain regions was paralleled with the distribution of alpha 7 nAChRs in the monkey brain. Moreover, in the blocking SPECT imaging study, the selective alpha 7 nAChR agonist SSR180711 blocked the radioactive uptake in the brain successfully. Conclusion: The CHIBA-1001 can be successfully radiolabeled with I-131 using the chloramine-T method. I-131-CHIBA-1001 can successfully accumulate in the monkey brain and image the alpha 7 acetylcholine receptors. I-131-CHIBA-1001 can be a candidate for imaging alpha 7 acetylcholine receptors, which will be of great value for the diagnosis and treatment of mental diseases.

Phosphodiesterase subtype 4 (PDE4) is particularly abundant in the brain and has been imaged with C-11-(R)-rolipram, a selective inhibitor of PDE4. We sought to measure in vivo both the binding site density (B-max) and the radioligand affinity (1/K-D) of C-11-(R)-rolipram in the rat brain. We also studied 2 critical factors in small-animal PET scans: the influence of anesthesia and the difference in binding under in vivo and in vitro conditions. Methods: In vivo, B-max and K-D were measured in PET saturation experiments by the administration of C-11-(R)-rolipram and various doses of carrier (R)-rolipram in conscious and isoflurane-anesthetized rats. The metabolite-corrected arterial input function was measured in each scan. To image conscious rats, the head of the rat was fixed in a holder and the animals were trained to comply with this apparatus. Bound and free (R)-rolipram levels were calculated under transient equilibrium conditions (i.e., at the time of peak specific binding). Results: The B-max and K-D of conscious rats were significantly greater than those of anesthetized rats, by 29% and 59%, respectively. In addition, the in vitro K-D was 3-7 times greater than was the in vivo K-D, although the B-max was similar in both conditions. Conclusion: The in vivo B-max and K-D of (R)-rolipram were successfully measured in both conscious and anesthetized rats. K-D was affected to a greater extent than was B-max by the 2 conditions. That is, K-D was increased in the conscious rat, compared with in the anesthetized rat, and K-D was increased in vitro, compared with in vivo. The current study shows that the rat, a readily available species for research, can be used to measure in vivo both affinity and density of radioligand targets, which can later be directly assessed with standard in vitro techniques.

Causes of knee pain include trauma, inflammation, and degeneration, but in many patients the pathophysiology remains unknown. Recent developments in advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques and molecular imaging facilitate more in-depth research focused on the pathophysiology of chronic musculoskeletal pain and more specifically inflammation. The forthcoming new insights can help develop better targeted treatment, and some imaging techniques may even serve as imaging biomarkers for predicting and assessing treatment response in the future. This review highlights the latest developments in perfusion MRI, diffusion MRI, and molecular imaging with positron emission tomography/MRI and their application in the painful knee. The primary focus is synovial inflammation, also known as synovitis. Bone perfusion and bone metabolism are also addressed.	[Mostert, Jacob M.; Dur, Niels B. J.; Oei, Edwin H.

Their widespread expression and broad role in signal transduction underline their importance in human physiology. Despite more than 800 GPCRs sharing a common architecture, unique differences govern ligand specificity and pathway selectivity. From the relatively simplified view offered by classical radioligand binding assays and contractility responses in organ baths, the road from ligand binding to biological action has become more and more complex as we learn about the molecular mediators that underly GPCR activation and translate it to physiological outcomes. In particular, the development of biosensors has evolved over the years to dissect the capacity of a given receptor to activate individual pathways. Here, we discuss how recent biosensor development has reinforced the idea that biased signaling may become mainstream in drug discovery programs.

Radioligand binding assays and chemical crosslinking showed TSPO to be a high affinity cholesterol-binding protein. In this report, we show that TSPO in mitochondrial fractions from MA-10 mouse tumour Leydig cells can interact directly and competitively with the clickable photoreactive cholesterol analogue. PhotoClick cholesterol showed saturable photoaffinity labelling of TSPO that could be specifically immuno-precipitated with anti-TSPO antibody, following the click reaction with the fluorescent-azide probe, tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-azide. Moreover, excess cholesterol reduced the photolabelling of both total mitochondrial proteins and TSPO. Together, the results of this study demonstrated direct binding of PhotoClick cholesterol to TSPO and that this interaction occurs at physiologically relevant site(s). [GRAPHICS] .

These were evaluated in a radioligand displacement binding assay, a [S-35] GTP gamma S binding assay, and in a competition association assay that enables the relatively fast kinetic screening of multiple compounds. The compounds show high affinities and a diverse range of kinetic profiles at the CB1 receptor and their structure kinetic relationships (SKRs) were established. Using the recently resolved hCB(1) receptor crystal structures, we also performed a modeling study that sheds light on the crucial interactions for both the affinity and dissociation kinetics of this family of ligands. We provide evidence that, next to affinity, additional knowledge of binding kinetics is useful for selecting new hCB(1) receptor antagonists in the early phases of drug discovery.

The Role of a Sodium Ion Binding Site in the Allosteric Modulation of the A<sub>2A</sub> Adenosine G Protein-Coupled Receptor	STRUCTURE			English	Article							MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; AMILORIDE ANALOGS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; CONSTANT-PRESSURE; AGONIST; IDENTIFICATION; GPCRS	The function of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can be modulated by a number of endogenous allosteric molecules. In this study, we used molecular dynamics, radioligand binding, and thermostability experiments to elucidate the role of the recently discovered sodium ion binding site in the allosteric modulation of the human A(2A) adenosine receptor, conserved among class A GPCRs. While the binding of antagonists and sodium ions to the receptor was noncompetitive in nature, the binding of agonists and sodium ions appears to require mutually exclusive conformational states of the receptor. Anniloride analogs can also bind to the sodium binding pocket, showing distinct patterns of agonist and antagonist modulation. These findings suggest that physiological concentrations of sodium ions affect functionally relevant conformational states of GPCRs and can help to design novel synthetic allosteric modulators or bitopic ligands exploiting the sodium ion binding pocket.

Direct detection and quantification of myelin content in vivo is desired to facilitate diagnosis and therapeutic treatments of myelin-related diseases. The imaging studies require use of myelin-imaging agents that readily enter the brain and selectively bind to myelinated regions. For this purpose, we have systematically evaluated a series of stilbene derivatives as myelin imaging agents. Spectrophotometry-based and radioligand-based binding assays showed that these stilbene derivatives exhibited relatively high myelin-binding affinities. In vitro myelin staining exhibited that the compounds selectively stained intact myelinated regions in wild type mouse brain. In situ tissue staining demonstrated that the compounds readily entered the mouse brain and selectively labeled myelinated white matter regions. These Studies suggested that these stilbene derivatives can be used as myelin-imaging probes to monitor myelin pathology in vivo.

The examination of K-i values revealed that most of these derivatives have high affinity and selectivity for the SERT. Moreover, substitutions at these positions differently influence the SERT binding: (i) The nature of the substituent linked at the I-position critically influences the SERT affinity. (ii) Functions containing heteroatom at the 2'-position afford compounds with high SERT affinity. (iii) The nature of the substituent at the 4'-position slightly influences the SERT affinity whereas steric effect markedly decreases the SERT affinity. From this series, the most SERT selective derivatives (such as 8b, 8c, and 8g) are now evaluated for their potential as positron emission tomography imaging agents when labeled with carbon-11.

The method incorporates solid phase sample extraction and is suitable for the determination of the analyte at pg ml(-1) concentrations. The antiserum was raised in Suffolk cross sheep following primary and booster immunisations with an immunogen prepared by conjugating a carboxyphenylmethyl derivative of AR-C68397XX, to bovine serum albumin. The radioligand was prepared by the I-125-labelled iodination of a derivative of AR-C68397XX. The solid phase extraction procedure, using octadecyl sorbent, was introduced to remove matrix interferences in the plasma and to enhance method sensitivity. The calibration range is 20-500 pg ml(-1), using 0.5 mi of undiluted human plasma sample. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The existence of 19 different subunits (six alpha, three beta, three gamma, delta, epsilon, theta, pi, and three rho) in mammalian systems gives rise to an enormous theoretical diversity of GABAA receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition and unique pharmacological properties. These receptors are already now the drug targets of several clinically used compounds, such as benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and many more. There is a constant quest to identify novel molecules and possible future drug targets: Currently, alpha 6-containing GABAA receptors are being discussed in the context of treating sensorimotor gating deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as tic disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, we aim to learn more about alpha 6-containing GABAA receptors. They are mostly expressed in the cerebellar granule cell layer, where they form the following subtypes: alpha 6 beta x gamma 2, alpha 1 alpha 6 beta x gamma 2, alpha 6 beta x delta, and alpha 1 alpha 6 beta x delta. In former studies, alpha 1 alpha 6 beta x gamma 2-containing GABAA receptors were considered a single receptor population. In the current study, we investigate the possibility, that this population can consist of two subgroups with alternative arrangements depending if alpha 1 neighbors gamma 2 (forming a "diazepam-sensitive" receptor), or if alpha 6 neighbors gamma 2 (forming a "diazepam-insensitive" receptor) and aimed to prove the existence of both subtypes in native tissue. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments on rat cerebellar lysates using alpha 1- or alpha 6 subunit-specific antibodies followed by radioligand binding assays with either 3H-flunitrazepam or 3H-Ro 15-4513. Indeed, we were able to prove the existence of two distinct populations of a1 a6containing GABAA-receptors and could quantify the different receptor populations: alpha 1 beta x gamma 2 receptors constitute approximately 60% of all gamma 2-containing receptors in the rat cerebellum, alpha 6 beta x gamma 2 about 20%, and both isoforms of alpha 1 alpha 6 beta x gamma 2 9-15% each. The simple classification of GABAA-receptors into ax-containing subtypes seems not to reflect the complexity of nature; those receptors are more diverse than previously thought.

The novel derivatives explore the effect of fluorination at different positions of two pyrimidine-based scaffolds. The most interesting ligands combine excellent hA(2B) affinity (K-i < 15 nM) and remarkable subtype selectivity. The results of functional cAMP experiments confirmed the antagonistic behavior of representative ligands. The compounds were designed on the basis of previous molecular models of the stereoselective binding of the parent scaffolds to the hA(2B) receptor, and we herein provide refinement of such models with the fluorinated compounds, which allows the explanation of the spurious effects of the fluorination at the different positions explored. These models are importantly confirmed by a synergistic study combining chiral HPLC, circular dichroism, diastereoselective synthesis, molecular modeling, and X-ray crystallography, providing experimental evidence toward the stereospecific interaction between optimized trifluorinated stereoisomers and the hA(2B) receptor.

Here, we present a method that relates minute-by-minute fluctuations of the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [11C]raclopride directly to subsecond dopamine release events. We show theoretically that synaptic dopamine release induces low frequency temporal variations of extrasynaptic extracellular dopamine levels, at time scales of one minute, that can evoke detectable temporal variations in the [11C] raclopride signal. Hence, dopaminergic activity can be monitored via temporal fluctuations in the [11C] raclopride PET signal. We validate this theory using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry and [11C] raclopride PET in mice during chemogenetic activation of dopaminergic neurons. We then apply the method to data from human subjects given a palatable milkshake and discover immediate and-for the first time-delayed food-induced dopamine release. This method enables time-dependent regional monitoring of stimulus-evoked dopamine release at physiological levels.

Convergent <SUP>18</SUP>F-labeling and evaluation of <i>N</i>-benzylphenethylamines as 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor PET ligands	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						F-18-labeling; PET; Serotonin; 5-HT2A receptor agonist	EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RADIOLIGAND; AGONISTS; RELEASE; DESIGN	Positron emission tomography (PET) investigations of the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) system can be used as a research tool in diseases such as depression, Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. We have previously developed a C-11-labeled agonist PET ligand ([C-11]Cimbi-36), and the aim of this study was to identify a F-18-labeled analogue of this PET-ligand. Thus, we developed a convergent radiochemical approach giving easy access to 5 different F-18-labeled ligands structurally related to Cimbi-36 from a common F-18-labeled intermediate. After intravenous injection, all ligands entered the pig brain. However, since within-scan intervention with ketanserin, a known orthosteric 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, did not result in significant blocking, the radioligands seem unsuitable for neuroimaging of the 5-HT2AR in vivo.

Evaluation of phytocannabinoids from high-potency <i>Cannabis sativa</i> using in vitro bioassays to determine structure-activity relationships for cannabinoid receptor 1 and cannabinoid receptor 2	MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Cannabis; Tetrahydrocannabinol; Structure-activity relationship; Cannabinoid; Cannabinoid receptor 1; Cannabinoid receptor 2	CB2; PHARMACOLOGY; CONSTITUENT; TRENDS	Cannabis has been around for thousands of years and has been used recreationally, medicinally, and for fiber. Over 500 compounds have been isolated from Cannabis sativa with approximately 105 being cannabinoids. Of those 105 compounds, Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol has been determined as the primary constituent, which is also responsible for the psychoactivity associated with Cannabis. Cannabinoid receptors belong to the large superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors. Targeting the cannabinoid receptors has the potential to treat a variety of conditions such as pain, neurodegeneration, appetite, immune function, anxiety, cancer, and others. Developing in vitro bioassays to determine binding and functional activity of compounds has the ability to lead researchers to develop a safe and effective drug that may target the cannabinoid receptors. Using radioligand binding and functional bioassays, a structure-activity relationship for major and minor cannabinoids was developed.

To date, the most promising radioligands for the in vivo imaging of this receptor have structures based on that of the cannabinoid antagonist, SR141716A. Rodent data obtained using these in vivo radiotracers has demonstrated that both the behavioral and neurochemical effects of cannabinoids occur at very low levels of receptor occupancy. More recently, an agonist radiotracer based on the structure of aminoalkylindole cannabinoids has also been examined for in vivo labeling of CBI receptors. Although rodent studies have indicated that in vivo imaging of CBI receptors is feasible, at the present time this receptor has still to be successful imaged in a human PET study.

In all tumors an additional PCR amplificate was detected in which 144 bp within the third tron were deleted. This fragment corresponded to the third cytoplasmic domain of the receptor protein, The short variant resulted from atypical mRNA processing, There were no common splice recognition sequences around the deleted fragment; instead its excision resembled the removal of a transposon. The deletion was not detected in normal human melanocytes nor in human or rat brain. However, it mas present in a human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), Thus, it appears that the occurrence of the short delta opioid receptor is correlated to malignancy.

Influence of short-term dexamethasone on the efficacy of <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA-617 in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer	PROSTATE			English	Article						glucocorticoids; prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA); PSMA-617; steroids; therapy	MITOXANTRONE PLUS PREDNISONE; BIOCHEMICAL RECURRENCE; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; INCREASED SURVIVAL; T PET/CT; DOCETAXEL; CHEMOTHERAPY; ABIRATERONE; ANTIGEN; TRIAL	Background and Aim Corticosteroids alone or in combination therapy are associated with favorable biochemical responses in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). We speculated that the intermittent addition of dexamethasone may also enhance the antitumor effect of radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-617. Patients and Methods Seventy-one patients with mCRPC were treated with 1 to 5 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 (6.0-7.4 GBq per cycle) at 6 to 8 weeks intervals. Based on the clinical decision (eg, in the case of vertebral metastases), 56% of patients received 4 mg of dexamethasone for the first 5 days of each cycle. Biochemical response rates, PSA decline and progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed after one, three, and five cycles of RLT. Results PSA response rates were not significantly different between patients receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 plus dexamethasone and those receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 alone after one, three, and five cycles (33% vs 39%, P = .62; 45% vs 45%, P = 1.0; and 38% vs 42%, P = .81). However, there was a nonsignificant trend for a more pronounced PSA decline in patients with bone metastases receiving adjunct dexamethasone (-21% +/- 50% vs +11% +/- 90%, P = .08; -21% +/- 69% vs +22% +/- 116%, P = .07; -13% +/- 76% vs +32% +/- 119%, P = .07). Median PFS tended to be longer in patients with bone metastases receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 plus dexamethasone (146 vs 81 days; hazard ratio: 0.87 [95% confidence interval: 0.47-1.61]; P = .20). Multiple regression analysis showed that age (P = .0110), alkaline phosphatase levels (P = .0380) and adjunct dexamethasone (P = .0285) were independent predictors of changes in PSA in patients with bone metastases. Conclusions We observed high response rates to Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT in men with mCRPC. The short-term addition of dexamethasone to Lu-177-PSMA-617 had no striking antitumor effect but might enhance biochemical responses in patients with bone metastases. Future trials are warranted to test this hypothesis in a prospective setting.	[Derlin, Thorsten; Sohns, Jan M.

Evaluation of PET Brain Radioligands for Imaging Pancreatic β-Cell Mass: Potential Utility of <SUP>11</SUP>C-(+)-PHNO	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						diabetes; pancreas; beta-cell mass; PHNO; PET	INSULIN-SECRETION; IN-VIVO; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; DOPAMINE-RECEPTORS; BINDING; ISLETS; TOMOGRAPHY; LANGERHANS; HEALTHY; MODEL	Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by a loss of beta-cells in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas and subsequent deficient insulin secretion in response to hyperglycemia. Development of an in vivo test to measure beta-cell mass (BCM) would greatly enhance the ability to track diabetes therapies. beta-cells and neurologic tissues have common cellular receptors and transporters, therefore, we screened brain radioligands for their ability to identify beta-cells. Methods: We examined a beta-cell gene atlas for endocrine pancreas receptor targets and cross-referenced these targets with brain radioligands that were available at our institution. Twelve healthy control subjects and 2 T1DM subjects underwent dynamic PET/CT scans with 6 tracers. Results: The D2/D3 receptor agonist radioligand C-11-(1)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine (PHNO) was the only radioligand to demonstrate sustained uptake in the pancreas with high contrast versus abdominal organs such as the kidneys, liver, and spleen, based on the first 30 min of data. Mean SUV from 20 to 30 min demonstrated high uptake of C-11-(1)-PHNO in healthy controls (SUV, 13.8) with a 71% reduction in a T1DM subject with undetectable levels of C-peptide (SUV, 4.0) and a 20% reduction in a T1DM subject with fasting C-peptide level of 0.38 ng/mL (SUV, 11.0). SUV in abdominal organs outside the pancreas did not show measurable differences between the control and T1DM subjects, suggesting that the changes in SUV of C-11-(1)-PHNO may be specific to changes in the pancreas between healthy controls and T1DM subjects. When D-3 and D-2 antagonists were used in nonhuman primates, specific pancreatic binding (SUVR-1) of C-11-PHNO was reduced by 57% and 38%, respectively. Conclusion: C-11-(1)-PHNO is a potential marker of BCM, with 2: 1 binding of D-3 receptors over D-2 receptors. Further in vitro and in vivo studies to establish D-2/D-3 receptor specificity to beta-cells is warranted to characterize C-11-(1)-PHNO as a candidate for clinical measurement of BCM in healthy control and diabetic subjects.

Millions of patients around the world suffer endlessly from difficult-to-manage debilitating pain because of very limited diagnostic tests and a paucity of pain therapies. To help these patients, we have developed a novel clinical molecular imaging approach, and, in its early stages, it has been shown to accurately identify the exact site of pain generation using an imaging biomarker for the sigma-1 receptor and positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging. We hope the description of the work in this article can help others begin their own pain imaging programs at their respective institutions.

Some GPCRs also possess allosteric sites, which have become a focus of drug discovery. In the M-2 muscarinic receptor, allosteric modulators regulate the binding and functional effects of orthosteric ligands through a mix of conformational changes, steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion transmitted within and between the constituent protomers of an oligomer. Tacrine has been called an atypical modulator because it exhibits positive cooperativity, as revealed by Hill coefficients greater than 1 in its negative allosteric effect on binding and response. Radioligand binding and molecular dynamics simulations were used to probe the mechanism of that modulation in monomers and oligomers of wild-type and mutant M-2 receptors. Tacrine is not atypical at monomers, which indicates that its atypical effects are a property of the receptor in its oligomeric state. These results illustrate that oligomerization of the M-2 receptor has functional consequences.

Synthesis and Pharmacological Evaluation of Triazolopyrimidinone Derivatives as Noncompetitive, Intracellular Antagonists for CC Chemokine Receptors 2 and 5	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							BINDING-SITE; SMALL-MOLECULE; POTENT; DRUGS	CC chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 5 (CCR5) are involved in many inflammatory diseases; however, most CCR2 and CCR5 clinical candidates have been unsuccessful. (Pre)clinical evidence suggests that dual CCR2/CCR5 inhibition might be more effective in the treatment of such multifactorial diseases. In this regard, the highly conserved intracellular binding site in chemokine receptors provides a new avenue for the design of multitarget ligands. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated the biological activity of a series of triazolopyrimidinone derivatives in CCR2 and CCR5. Radioligand binding assays first showed that they bind to the intracellular site of CCR2, and in combination with functional assays on CCR5, we explored structure-affinity/activity relationships in both receptors. Although most compounds were CCR2-selective, 39 and 43 inhibited beta-arrestin recruitment in CCR5 with high potency. Moreover, these compounds displayed an insurmountable mechanism of inhibition in both receptors, which holds promise for improved efficacy in inflammatory diseases.	[Zacarias, Natalia V.

However, TSPO is considered a challenge for molecular imaging due to the poor availability of suitable radiotracers with adequate pharmacokinetic properties. Here, we describe the development of a radiofluorinated pyridinyl isoquinoline analogue of the established TSPO PET tracer (R)-[C-11]PK11195 with improved binding properties in all known human TSPO phenotypes. We conducted a complete preclinical evaluation using in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo methods to assess the performance of this novel radiotracer and observed high specific binding of the radiotracer to TSPO, as well as high metabolic stability. Therefore, we propose this radiolabeled compound for further evaluation in animal models as well as in clinical trials. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

We tested directly whether individual differences in MOR are associated with neural reward responses to food pictures in humans. We scanned 33 non-obese individuals with positron emission tomography (PET) using the MOR-specific radioligand [C-11] carfentanil. During a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan, the subjects viewed pictures of appetizing versus bland foods to elicit reward responses. MOR availability was measured in key components of the reward and emotion circuits and used to predict BOLD-fMRI responses to foods. Viewing palatable versus bland foods activates regions involved in homeostatic and reward processing, such as amygdala, ventral striatum, and hypothalamus. MOR availability in the reward and emotion circuit is negatively associated with the fMRI reward responses. Variation in MOR availability may explain why some people feel an urge to eat when encountering food cues, increasing risk for weight gain and obesity.

In particular, 5-amino-2-halo-4-phenoxypyridines (11, 12, 13) were designed as key intermediates for the synthesis of the recently developed TSPO ligand 6-F-PBR28 and its fluorine-18-labeled version for positron emission tomography, 6-[F-18]F-PBR28. We hereby report the chemical preparation as well as the H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopic data of polysubstituted pyridines 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7b, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. The latter demonstrates dramatic changes in electron density repartition of the aromatic ring upon substitution.

J	Matthews, PM; Rabiner, I; Gunn, R				Matthews, Paul M.; Rabiner, Ilan; Gunn, Roger			Non-invasive imaging in experimental medicine for drug development	CURRENT OPINION IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN; TUMOR; PET; ASSOCIATION; DIAGNOSIS; DISEASE; RISK; MRI	Clinical imaging offers a range of methods for the support of drug development that are able to address major questions related to target validation and molecule biodistribution, target interactions and pharmacodynamics. Here we review recent innovative applications of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). New approaches to human target validation exploring MRI or PET biomarker changes related to allelic variation at candidate target loci can contribute to human target validation. PET molecular imaging can define molecule biodistribution directly and, if an appropriate, target-specific radioligand is available, be employed in small experimental medicine studies to provide plasma pharmacokinetic-target occupancy data to guide dose selection. An enlarging range of imaging biomarkers for pharmacodynamic studies is enabling imaging experimental medicine studies to assess the potential efficacy of new therapeutic molecules. Integration of these approaches promises improvements in therapeutic molecule differentiation and may contribute in ways that would improve the value proposition for use of a new drug through patient stratification.

Herein WAY-100635 (pK(i) at human(h) serotonin 5-HT1A receptors=9.5l;pK(i) at dopaminc hD(4.4) receptors=7.42) stimulated [S-35]GTP-gamma S incorporation in membranes of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells expressing dopamine hD4.4 receptors with only moderate potency and modest efficacy (pEC(50) = 6.63; Emax = 19% of dopamine). Moreover, in antagonism experiments, WAY-100635 had a much lower potency at dopamine hD4.4 receptors (pK(B) = 7.09), than at serotonin h5-HT1A receptors (pK(B) = 9.47). These data demonstrate that WAY-100635 has high selectivity for serotonin h5-HT1A versus doparnine hD(4.4) receptors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dopaminergic systems appear to be particularly important in HIV-associated dementia. In the current studies, we determined that primary cell cultures prepared from the midbrain of 18-day-old rat fetuses are sensitive to Tat neurotoxicity and investigated the possible effects of Tat on DAT-specific ligand binding and DAT immunoreactivity in rat fetal midbrain cultures. We found that Tat neurotoxicity was associated with a significant decrease in [3H]WIN 35428 binding. Immunostaining of cell cultures with antibodies recognizing the C-end epitope of DAT did not reveal significant changes in DAT immunoreactivity. The results 017 this Study implicate involvement of monoamine transmission systems in HIV-associated dementia. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

For the second radioligand a kit preparation, based on iododestannylation followed by solid-phase extraction, was possible. In vitro characterization using CHO-cells expressing different dopamine receptor subtypes gave K-i values of 3.1 and 2.6 nM.

However, in the present study, 14-methoxymetopon's efficacy proved to be only 1.5-fold higher than that of morphine (tau, 19 vs. 12). K(A) values were 2,900 nmol/kg for 14-methoxymetopon and 46,000 nmol/kg for morphine (Ki for [(3)H]DAMGO binding, 0.33 vs 3.4 nmol/l). Thus, the 24-fold higher potency of methoxymetopon could be fully accounted for by its 16-fold higher apparent in vivo affinity and its only 1.5-fold higher efficacy. Furthermore, the 10-fold higher affinity of 14-methoxymetopon for the mu opioid receptor - as previously determined in radioligand binding assays - was confirmed in the present behavioral tests of thermal antinociception.

PET quantification of brain <i>O</i>-GlcNAcase with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]LSN3316612 in healthy human volunteers	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						O-GlcNAcase; Positron emission tomography; Tauopathy; Test-retest reliability; Neuroimaging	TAU; GLCNACYLATION	Background Previous studies found that [F-18]LSN3316612 was a promising positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in nonhuman primates and human volunteers. This study sought to further evaluate the suitability of [F-18]LSN3316612 for human clinical research. Methods Kinetic evaluation of [F-18]LSN3316612 was conducted in a combined set of baseline brain scans from 17 healthy human volunteers and test-retest imaging was conducted in 10 of these volunteers; another 6 volunteers had whole-body scans to measure radiation exposure to body organs. Total distribution volume (V-T) estimates were compared for the one- and two-tissue compartment models with the arterial input function. Test-retest variability and reliability were evaluated via mean difference and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The time stability of V-T was assessed down to a 30-min scan time. An alternative quantification method for [F-18]LSN3316612 binding without blood was also investigated to assess the possibility of eliminating arterial sampling. Results Brain uptake was generally high and could be quantified as V-T with excellent identifiability using the two-tissue compartment model. [F-18]LSN3316612 exhibited good absolute test-retest variability (12.5%), but the arithmetic test-retest variability was far from 0 (11.3%), reflecting a near-uniform increase of V-T on the retest scan in nine of 10 volunteers. V-T values were stable after 110 min in all brain regions, suggesting that no radiometabolites accumulated in the brain. Measurements obtained using only brain activity (i.e., area under the curve (AUC) from 150-180 min) correlated strongly with regional V-T values during test-retest conditions (R-2 = 0.84), exhibiting similar reliability to V-T (ICC = 0.68 vs. 0.64). Estimated radiation exposure for [F-18]LSN3316612 PET was 20.5 +/- 2.1 mu Sv/MBq, comparable to other F-18-labeled radioligands for brain imaging. Conclusions [F-18]LSN3316612 is an excellent PET radioligand for imaging O-GlcNAcase in the human brain. Alternative quantification without blood is possible, at least for within-subject repeat studies. However, the unexplained increase of V-T under retest conditions requires further investigation.

The kinetics and pharmacology of [H-3]1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano[2,3-b]quinolin-7-yl)-2-phenyl-1-ethanone (R214127) binding to rat mGlu1a receptor Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-dhfr(-) membranes was investigated, as well as the distribution of [H-3]R214127 binding in rat brain tissue and sections. Specific binding to rat mGlu1a receptor CHO-dhfr(-) membranes was similar to92% of total and was optimal at 4degreesC. Full association was reached within 5 min, and [H-3]R214127 bound to a single binding site with an apparent K-D of 0.90 +/- 0.14 nM and a B-max of 6512 +/- 1501 fmol/mg of protein. Inhibition experiments showed that [H-3]R214127 binding was completely blocked by 2-quinoxaline-carboxamide-N-adamantan-1-yl (NPS 2390), (3aS, 6aS)-6a-naphtalan-2-ylmethyl-5-methyliden-hexahydro-cyclopenta[c]furan-1-on (BAY 36-7620), and 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt), but was not displaced by competitive mGlu1 receptor ligands such as glutamate and quisqualate, suggesting that R214127, NPS 2390, BAY 36-7620, and CPCCOEt bind to the same site or mutually exclusive sites. Experiments using rat cortex, striatum, hippocampus and cerebellum revealed that [H-3]R214127 labeled a single high-affinity binding site (K-D similar to 1 nM). B-max values were highest in the cerebellum (4302 +/- 2042 fmol/mg of protein) and were 741 +/- 48, 688 +/- 125, and 471 +/- 68 fmol/mg of protein in the striatum, hippocampus, and cortex, respectively. The distribution of [H-3]R214127 binding in rat brain was investigated in more detail by radioligand autoradiography. A high density of binding sites was detected in the molecular layer of the cerebellum. Moderate labeling was seen in the CA3 and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, thalamus, olfactory tubercle, amygdala, and substantia nigra reticulata. The cerebral cortex, caudate putamen, ventral pallidum, and nucleus accumbens showed lower labeling. The high affinity and selectivity of [H-3]R214127 for mGlu1 receptors renders this compound the ligand of choice to study the native mGlu1 receptor in brain.

In vivo specific binding of [(3)H]KMD-3213 after continuous intravenous infusion of the ligand (100 pmol/kg/min for 10 min, followed by 30 pmol/kg/min for 60 or 90 min) differed largely among the tissues examined. Specific binding of [(3)H]KMD-3213 in aorta, heart, lung, and kidney was not different in terms of infusion time in the case of continuous infusion for 10, 70 and 100 min, whereas the binding in prostate, vas deferens, and submaxillary gland by 70- and/or 100-min infusion was significantly greater than that by the 10-min infusion. A similar extent of specific binding in the prostate was observed by the infusion (100 min) of a three-fold higher dose of [(3)H]KMD-3213. Continuous intravenous infusion of KMD-3213 (100 pmol/kg/min for 10 min, followed by 30 pmol/kg/ min) for 70 or 100 min significantly reduced the phenylephrine-induced increase in the mean blood pressure and that in the intraurethral pressure of anesthetized rats. Extent and time course of the KMD-3213 effect reduction in the phenylephrine-induced increase in intraurethral pressure were closely associated with those in prostatic [(3)H]KMD-3213 binding after continuous infusion of the corresponding dosage of the radioligand. The reduction in the phenylephrine-induced increase by the infusion of a three-fold higher dose of KMD-3213 was significantly greater in the case of the intraurethral pressure than in that of the mean blood pressure, thereby suggesting a greater selectivity for the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the lower urinary tract than for that in the vascular tissue. In conclusion, the present study has shown that specific binding of [(3)H]KMD-3213 in the rat prostate after the continuous intravenous infusion of the radioligand may be closely associated with the pharmacological effect of this drug on the lower urinary tract.

It is therefore of interest to develop a brain imaging method for diagnostic purposes. Z-(R,R)-1-azabicyclo[2.2.2] oct-3-yl alpha-hydroxy-alpha-(1-iodol-propen-3-yl)-alpha-phenylacetate (Z-IQNP) is a muscarinic antagonist with high affinity for the M2 subtype. Objective. The pharmacological characteristics and topographic distribution of radiolabelled Z-IQNP as a radioligand for the M2 mAChR subtype were examined in vitro and in vivo. Methods: Z-IQNP was labelled with I-125 and I-123. Autoradiography was performed on whole-hemisphere cryosections from human post mortem brains. SPECT was performed in a cynomolgus monkey. Results: Autoradiography showed binding of [I-125]Z-IQNP in all brain regions, which was inhibited by the non-selective muscarinic antagonist scopolamine. The addition of BIBN 99, a compound with high affinity for the M2 subtype, inhibited [I-125]Z-IQNP binding particularly in the cerebellum, which has a high density of the M2 subtype. SPECT demonstrated high uptake of [I-123]Z-IQNP in all brain regions. The binding was markedly reduced in all brain regions after pretreatment with the non-selective muscarinic antagonist dexetimide and also the M1 antagonist biperiden. Dexetimide markedly inhibited [I-123]Z-IQNP binding in the cerebellum, which is consistent with a high density of M2-receptors in this region. The sigma receptor binding compound DuP 734 had no effect on Z-IQNP binding either in vitro or in vivo. Conclusions: This study indicates that radiolabelled Z-IQNP has high specificity for mAChR with higher affinity for the M-2 than the M-1 subtype and negligible affinity for sigma recognition sites both in vitro and in vivo. [I-123]Z-IQNP should be useful for future SPECT studies in AD for examination of the density of M2 receptors particularly in the cerebellum.

Methods: Thirty men with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer previously treated with taxane-based chemotherapy and second-generation androgen deprivation therapy were enrolled. All patients received up to 3 cycles of approximately 2.0 GBq (55 mCi) of 177Lu-EB-PSMA per cycle at 8-wk intervals. The primary endpoint was therapeutic safety, including changes in hematologic status, liver function, and renal function. An additional primary endpoint was thera-peutic efficacy, including prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and molecular imaging response. The secondary endpoints were PSA progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Another end-point was patient-reported health-related quality of life. Results: From January 2019 to December 2021, 30, 22, and 11 patients received 1, 2, or 3 cycles of 177Lu-EB-PSMA RLT, respectively. During the entire follow-up period, 33.3% of patients experienced grade 3 hematologic adverse events. Seventeen (56.7%) patients achieved a PSA reduction of at least 50%. The median PSA PFS was 4.6 mo (95% CI, 2.7-6.5 mo), and the median OS was 12.6 mo (95% CI, 8.1-17.1 mo). A higher whole-body PSMA SUVmean correlated with a better PSA response, higher baseline alkaline phosphatase and larger total PSMA-positive tumor volume were associated with worse PSA PFS, and the existence of visceral metastases and higher PSA value at baseline were signifi-cant prognosticators of worse OS. Health-related quality-of-life out-comes improved significantly after 177Lu-EB-PSMA RLT. Conclusion: RLT based on approximately 2.0 GBq of 177Lu-EB-PSMA for up to 3 cycles may achieve a PSA response and hematologic toxicity compa-rable to those from 7.4-GBq doses of 177Lu-PSMA-617 for up to 4-6 cycles. Further studies with more cycles of 177Lu-EB-PSMA RLT are needed to evaluate the potential benefits in terms of PFS and OS.

The methods of ligand synthesis, results of in vitro characterization, C-11 labeling and in vivo micro-PET imaging studies of [C-11]EADAM in cynomolgus monkey brain are described. C-11 was introduced into N,N-dimethyl-2-(2'-amino-4'-ethylphenylthio)benzylamine (5) by alkylation of N-methyl-2-(2'-amino-4'-ethylphenylthio)-benzylamine (10) in 32% radiochemical yield (end of bombardment [EOB], decay-corrected from [C-11]methyl iodide). Competition binding assays in cells stably expressing the transfected human dopamine transporter (DAT), SERT and norepinephrine transporter (NET) labeled with [H-3]WIN 35428 or [I-125]RTI-55, [H-3]citalopram and [H-3]nisoxetine, respectively, indicated the following order of SERT affinity: ADAM > EADAM much greater than fluvoxamine. The affinity of EADAM for DAT and NET was 500- and > 1000-fold lower, respectively, than for SERT. Micro-PFT brain imaging studies in a cynomolgus monkey demonstrated high [C-11]EADAM uptake in the striatum, thalamus and brainstem. [C-11]EADAM uptake in these brain regions peaked in less than 60 inin following administration of [C-11]EADAM. The tissue-to-cerebellum ratios of the striatum, thalamus and brainstem were 1.67, 1.71 and 1.63, respectively, at 120 min postinjection of [C-11]EADAM. Analysis of monkey arterial plasma samples using high-pressure liquid chromatography determined there was no detectable formation of lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites capable of entering the brain. In a displacement experiment with citalopram in a cynomolgus monkey, radioactivity in the striatum, thalamus and brainstem was displaced 20 - 60 min after administration of citalopram. In a blocking experiment with citalopram in a cynomolgaus monkey, radioactivity in the striatum, thalamus and brainstem was significantly reduced. These results support the candidacy of [C-11]EADAM as a radioligand for visualizing brain SERT using PET. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

So far little is known about effects of stress on the thalamus. Using the chronic psychosocial stress paradigm in male tree shrews, we analyzed alpha-2B adrenoceptor expression in the paraventricular and the anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus after a six-week period of daily social stress and after a 10-day post-stress recovery period. In situ hybridization with a specific alpha-2B adrenoceptor probe was performed to quantify receptor gene expression in single neurons, and receptor binding was determined by in vitro receptor autoradiography using the radioligand [H-3]RX821002. To determine the stress level in the animals, we measured urinary cortisol excretion and body weight. In the neurons of the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, expression of the alpha-2B adrenoceptor transcript was increased after both the six-week chronic-stress period and the post-stress recovery period. Combination of in situ hybridization and immunocytochemistry revealed expression of alpha-2B adrenoceptor transcript in neurons that were stained with an antibody against glutamate but not in neurons immunoreactive for GABA. Alpha-2 adrenoceptor radioligand binding was also increased after both time periods in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus. No significant effects of stress and recovery were observed in the anteroventral thalamic nucleus. Urinary cortisol excretion was increased during the stress period but normalized thereafter. Body weight was reduced during weeks 1 to 3 of stress and then normalized. These data show that long-term chronic psychosocial stress has an impact on alpha-2B adrenoceptor expression in the thalamus and that the effect persists throughout a post-stress recovery period though activity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis normalizes after stress. Upregulation of the receptor probably alters neurotransmission in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus and may thus influence information transfer to limbic and cortical brain areas.

The evaluation of levels of expression of these immunosuppressive receptors is expected to clarify whether the absence of spare A(2A)Rs (no 'receptor reserve') might be one of the mechanisms of attenuation of the effects of extracellular adenosine on T-cells. A(2A) transcript is found in T-cells and functional receptors can be demonstrated, but the density of receptor on T-cells is too low to be detected by radioligand binding. Studies of direct radioligand binding to murine brain with the selective A(2A)R agonist [H-3]CGS21680 (2-{4-[(2-carboxyethyl)-phenyl]ethylamino}-5'-N-ethylcarbox-amidoadenosine) established that striata levels of A(2A)R are virtually absent from A(2A) knock-out mice. Mice that are heterozygous (A(2A)R(+/-)) for the A(2A)R express significantly decreased levels of A(2A)R. To test for the presence of spare receptors in T-cells we took advantage of this gene dose effect and examined whether the decrease in the number of receptors in thymocytes from A(2A)R(+/-) mice was proportionately reflected in a decrease in the functional cAMP response of T-cells to adenosine. cAMP accumulation and apoptosis induced by adenosine and by A(2A)R agonist are of a lower magnitude in T-cells from A(2A)R(+/-) heterozygous mice than in T-cells from A(2A)R(+/+) littermate control mice. These results indicate that there is no A(2A)R reserve in murine T-cells. Strongly decreased adenosine-triggered cAMP increases were detected in thymocytes from A(2A)R(-/-) mice, suggesting that A(2A) adenosine receptors cannot fully compensate for the loss of A(2A)Rs in murine T-cells. We conclude that the number of A(2A)Rs is the limiting factor in determining the maximal cAMP response of T-lymphocytes to extracellular adenosine, thereby minimizing the immunosuppressive effects of extracellular adenosine.

Thus, TSPO may be a suitable in vivo indicator of neurodegeneration. Here, we quantified the F-18-DPA-714 radioligand in healthy TSPO-genotyped volunteers and developed a method to eliminate the need for invasive arterial blood sampling. Methods: Ten controls (7 high-affinity binders [HABs] and 3 mixed-affinity binders [MABs]) underwent F-18-DPA-714 PET with arterial and venous sampling. F-18-DPA-714 binding was quantified with a metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function, using the 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models (TCMs) as well as the Logan analysis to estimate total volume distribution (VT) in the regions of interest. Alternative quantification methods were tested, including tissue-to-plasma ratio or population-based input function approaches normalized by late time points of arterial or venous samples. Results: The distribution pattern of F-18-DPA-714 was consistent with the known distribution of TSPO in humans, with the thalamus displaying the highest binding and the cerebellum the lowest. The 2-TCM best described the regional kinetics of F-18-DPA-714 in the brain, with good identifiability (percentage coefficient of variation < 5%). For each region of interest, VT was 47.6% 6.3% higher in HABs than in MABs, and estimates from the 2-TCM and the Logan analyses were highly correlated. Equilibrium was reached at 60 min after injection. VT calculated with alternative methods using arterial samples was strongly and significantly correlated with that calculated by the 2-TOM. Replacement of arterial with venous sampling in these methods led to a significant but lower correlation. Conclusion: Genotyping of subjects is a prerequisite for a reliable quantification of F-18-DPA-714 PET images. The 2-TOM and the Logan analyses are accurate methods to estimate F-18-DPA-714 VT in the human brain of both HAB and MAB individuals. Population-based input function and tissue-to-plasma ratio with a single arterial sample are promising alternatives to classic arterial plasma input function. Substitution with venous samples is promising but still requires methodologic improvements.

Longitudinal DAT changes measured with [18F]FE-PE2I PET in patients with Parkinson?s disease; a validation study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Dopamine transporter; Parkinson?s disease; Positron emission tomography; Longitudinal; Biomarker	DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; PROGRESSION; QUANTIFICATION; BRAIN; C-11-PE2I; BINDING	Background: Dopamine transporter (DAT) PET provides higher resolution than DAT SPECT and opportunity for integrated imaging with MRI. The radioligand [18F]FE-PE2I is highly selective for the DAT, and PET measure-ments with this radioligand have good reliability and repeatability in patients with non-advanced Parkinson's disease.Objectives: To validate [18F]FE-PE2I PET as measurement tool of longitudinal DAT changes in patients with Parkinson's disease.Methods: Thirty-seven subjects with Parkinson's disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage < 3) were included in a longi-tudinal PET study with [18F]FE-PE2I. DAT availability (BPND) in the caudate nucleus, putamen, sensorimotor striatum, and substantia nigra, was estimated with parametric imaging using Logan graphical analysis and cerebellum as reference region. For comparison with DAT-SPECT literature, sample size calculations for disease intervention studies were made.Results: Baseline and follow-up PET data (interval: 2.3 +/- 0.5 years) were available for 25 patients (9 females, 16 males). Median age was 64.7 years (range 46-76); symptom duration: 3 years (0.25-14); Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&Y): 1 (1-2). Annualized DAT decline and effect size were:-8.5 +/- 6.6 % and 1.08 for caudate nucleus;-7.1 +/- 6.1 % and 1.02 for putamen;-8.3 +/- 8.5 % and 0.99 for sensorimotor striatum;-0.11 +/- 9.3 % and 0.11 for substantia nigra. The estimated minimum sample size needed for a treatment trial using [18F]FE-PE2I PET as imaging marker is 2-3 times lower than is reported in literature on [123I]FP-CIT SPECT.Conclusions: Longitudinal [18F]FE-PE2I PET measurements in non-advanced PD demonstrate a striatal DAT decline consistent with previous SPECT and PET studies. No obvious changes of DAT availability were observed in the substantia nigra, indicating perhaps slower progression or compensatory changes. The effect sizes were numerically larger than reported in the literature for other DAT radioligands, suggesting that [18F]FE-PE2I might detect smaller DAT changes, and can be well used as progression marker in clinical trials.

In this study, the combined effect of binding affinity, lipophilicity, protein binding and blood plasma level on cerebral pharmacokinetics and PET imaging characteristics of three xanthine-derived A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) radioligands was investigated in rats. Methods: A comparative evaluation of two novel cyclobutyl-substituted xanthine derivatives, 8-cyclobutyl-3-(3[F-18]fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine ( [F-18]CBX) and 3-(3-[F-18]fluoropropyl)-8-(1-methylcyclobutyl)-1-propylxanthine ([F-18]MCBX), with the reference A(1)AR radioligand 8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-[F-18]fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine ([F-18]CPFPX) was conducted. This evaluation included in vitro competition binding assays, in vitro autoradiography and in vivo PET imaging. Differences in cerebral pharmacokinetics and minimal scan duration required for quantification of cerebral distribution volume (V-T) were assessed. Results: Measured K-i values of non-labeled COX, MCBX and CPFPX were 10.0 +/- 052 nM, 33 +/- 030 nM and 1.4 +/- 0.15 nM, respectively (n = 3-4). In vitro autoradiographic binding patterns in rat brain were comparable between the radioligands, as well as the fraction of non-specific binding (1.0-1.9%). in vivo cerebral pharmacokinetics of the novel cyclobutyl-substituted xanthines differed considerably from that of [F-18]CPFPX. Brain uptake and V-T of [F-18]CBX were substantially lower despite the higher concentration of radiotracer in plasma. [F-18]MCBX showed comparable uptake and V-T, but faster cerebral kinetics than [F-18]CPFPX. However, the faster kinetics of [F-18]MCBX did not enable the quantification of cerebral V-T in a shorter scan time. Conclusions: The combined effect of individual physicochemical and pharmacological properties of a radiotracer on its PET imaging characteristics cannot be readily predicted. In vivo performance of the xanthine A(1)AR radioligands was mainly influenced by binding affinity: plasma concentrations and cerebral kinetics were of secondary importance. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Non-invasive estimation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28 binding potential	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						[C-11]PBR28; Neuroinflammation; Alzheimer's disease; Kinetic modeling; PET; TSPO	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PET RADIOLIGAND BINDING; ULTRA-HIGH RISK; IN-VIVO; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; REFERENCE REGION; MICROGLIAL ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INPUT FUNCTIONS	[C-11]PBR28 is a PET radioligand used to estimate densities of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in vivo. Since there is no suitable reference region, arterial blood samples are required for full quantification. Here, we evaluate a methodology for full quantification of [C-11]PBR28 PET data that does not require either a reference region or blood samples. Simultaneous estimation (SIME) uses time-activity curves from several brain regions to estimate binding potential (BPND), a theoretically more sensitive outcome measure than total distribution volume. SIME can be employed with either a measured arterial input function (AIF) or a template input function (tIF) that has similar shape as the AIF, but with arbitrary amplitude. We evaluated the ability of SIME to detect group differences in TSPO densities using PET and arterial plasma data from 21 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and 15 controls that underwent [C-11]PBR28 imaging. Regional BPND obtained with tIFs were compared to those obtained using measured AIFs. Standard kinetic modeling was also employed for comparison. The sensitivity of each method to detect group differences in TSPO densities were assessed by comparing estimated effect sizes between AD patients and controls. For this purpose, BPND estimated for one region with high pathological burden (inferior temporal cortex), and for one region with low pathological burden (cerebellum) was used. BPND estimates obtained with SIME and tIFs were close to identical to those obtained with AIF (3.0 + 21% difference, r(2) = 0.78). In this dataset, the effect sizes between AD patients and controls for both SIME with AIF and SIME with tIF were similar (30.3%, p = 0.001 and 31.0%, p = 0.004, respectively) and were each greater than the effect size observed using the two-tissue compartment model (16.1%, p = 0.12). None of the tested methods showed difference in TSPO binding in cerebellum. These results demonstrate that BPND can be estimated for [C-11]PBR28 using SIME, and may be useful in clinical studies. In addition, arterial sampling may not be necessary if tIFs can be reliably estimated.	[Schain, Martin; Zanderigo, Francesca; Ogden, R.

[F-18]LBT-999 PET studies in baboons showed a lower brain uptake than [C-11]LBT-999 and a high bone uptake, suggesting the presence of interfering metabolites. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo metabolism of these radiotracers was investigated. Methods: Rat and human liver microsomal incubations, baboon plasma and rat brain extracts were analyzed by radio-HPLC and LC-MS-MS. Results: In vitro experiments demonstrated the formation by P450s of five polar metabolites. The main routes of LBT-999 metabolism proposed were N-dealkylation, tolyl-hydroxylation and dealkylation plus tolyl-hydroxylation. In vivo in baboons, [F-18]LBT-999 was rapidly converted into a [F-18]hydroxylated metabolite likely oxidized in plasma into a [F-18]carboxylic acid and into unlabeled N-dealkyl-LBT-999. The latter was detected in baboon plasma and in rat brain by LC-MS-MS. The time course of unchanged [F-18]LBT-999 decreased rapidly in plasma and was higher than that of [C-11]LBT-999 due to the formation of unlabeled N-dealkyl-LBT-999. In rats, striatum-to-cerebellum ratios of [F-18]LBT-999, [F-18]hydroxylated and [F-18]acidic metabolite were 20, 4.2 and 1.65, respectively, suggesting a possible accumulation of the hydroxylated compound in the striatum. Conclusion: P450s catalyzed the formation of dealkylated and hydroxylated metabolites of LBT-999. In baboons, an extensive metabolism of [F-18]LBT-999, with formation of unlabeled N-dealkyl-LBT-999, [F-18]fluorobutenaldehyde (or its oxidation product) and [F-18]hydroxy-LBT-999 able to penetrate the brain, prevented an easy and accurate estimation of the input function of the radiotracer. CYP3A4 being the main P450 involved in the metabolism of LBT-999, a similar pathway may occur in humans and confound PET quantification. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

At 4 C, the association was monophasic and rapid (t 1/2 = 8.0 min); dissociation was slower (t 1/2 = 64.2 min). The K-d in rat brain at 4 C was 0.063 nM, whereas at 22 and 37 C, the K-d values were 0.188 and 0.95 nM, respectively. In contrast, the B-max (34 fmol/mg protein) was unaffected by temperature. In human cortex, [H-3]A-585539 bound with a K-d of 0.066 nM and a B-max of 5.8 fmol/mg protein at 4 C, whereas under similar conditions, specific [H-3] methyllycaconitine ([H-3]MLA) binding was not measurable. A number of agonist and antagonist nAChR ligands displaced binding to rat brain membranes with rank order of affinity similar to that for [H-3] MLA, and in general, a 5 to 10-fold higher affinity was observed for [H-3] A-585539 binding. There was also a good correlation of K-i values between [H-3] A-585539 binding to rat brain and human cortex. The use of a alpha 7/5-hydroxytryptamine type-3 chimera revealed that the N-terminal domain of alpha 7 nAChR was sufficient to faithfully reproduce the pharmacology of [H-3]A-585539 binding. Autoradiographic studies comparing [H-3]A-585539 and [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin revealed a similar pattern of labeling in the rat. In summary, [H-3]A-585539 was shown to have excellent binding characteristics in rat and human brain and represents the first high-affinity alpha 7 agonist radioligand with utility in the characterization of this important nAChR subtype that is targeted toward ameliorating cognitive deficits underlying neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.

The reference region method has yielded results that are lower than the conventional approach, with the relative underestimation appearing to be an increasing function of k(3)/k(4). We performed simulations on idealized data to identify the source of the discrepancy, Both the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the original full reference tissue model (FRTM) were tested to determine (a) if the error in estimated k(3)/k(4) is dependent on the blood flow in the region of interest relative to the blood flow in the region of reference (R-1) and on the receptor density in the region of interest (true k(3)/k(4)), and (b) which violation of the reference model assumptions were responsible for this effect. FRTM returned parameter estimates that were independent and accurate if the reference region was constructed precisely as a one-tissue compartment model. SRTM overestimated k(3)/k(4) when the reference region was constructed as a one-tissue compartment model and underestimated k(3)/k(4) when the reference region was constructed as a two-tissue compartment model (which is the case for [C-11]WAY-100635). In both cases, the magnitude of the error in k(3)/k(4) returned by SRTM was dependent on true R-1 and true k(3)/k(4). In conclusion, the SRTM is associated with a bias in the derivation of k(3)/k(4) that is not a simple scaling factor. This magnitude of these errors should be carefully evaluated for each new radioligand. NUCL MED BIOL 27;5:487-492, 2000. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In disease, a secretin receptor (SCTR) was found to occur as a splice variant in gastrinoma and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Overexpression of SCTR has been described for gastrinomas, carcinoid tumors of the lung and cholangiocarcinoma. SCTR therefore is considered a candidate target for molecular tumor imaging as well as for peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) in a number of oncological indications. The aim of this study was to characterize SCTR expression in esophageal and pancreatic cancer, demonstrating for the first time high SCTR overexpression in these tumor types. In total, 65 of 70 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tissues stained strongly positive for SCTR in immunohistochemistry, as did most of the 151 esophageal cancer samples, with minor influence of grading in both entities. In addition, the aim of this study was to further delineate residues in human secretin that are critical for binding to and activation of human SCTR. For a potential development of short and metabolically stable analogs for clinical use, it was intended to probe the peptide for its capacity to incorporate deletions and substitutions without losing its affinity to SCTR. In a systematic approach, a library of 146 secretin variants containing single amino acid substitutions as well as truncations on either end was tested in beta-arrestin2-GFP translocation and fluorescent ligand internalization assays employing high-content analysis, in cAMP assays which run in agonist and antagonist mode, and in radioligand binding. The main structural determinants of SCTR binding and activation were localized to the N-terminus, with His(1), Asp(3) being among the most sensitive positions, followed by Phe(6), Thr(7) and Leu(10). Aminoterminal truncation caused a rapid decline in receptor activity and most of these variants proved to be partial agonists showing antagonistic properties. In this study, the most potent novel antagonist showed an IC50 of 309 +/- 74 nM in the beta-arrestin2-GFP translocation assay on human SCTR while remaining a weak partial agonist. Future studies will have to demonstrate the utility of further enhanced secretin analogues as tracers for in vivo imaging and therapy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the system using the National Electrical Manufacturers Association NU 4-2008 standard protocol. As a preliminary in vivo evaluation of the system, a PET measurement in an NHP was also performed. Methods: Resolution, sensitivity, image quality, and noise-equivalent count rate (NECR) were measured. NECR measurement was performed with a ratlike phantom and a monkeylike phantom. A Derenzo phantom experiment was performed to test the resolution using 3-dimensional ordered-subset expectation maximization reconstruction. One cynomolgus monkey (4.5 kg, intravenous ketamine/xylazine anesthesia) was examined with the dopamine transporter radioligand F-18-FE-PE2I (94 MBq) to evaluate the in vivo performance of the system. List-mode PET data acquired for 93 min were reconstructed into 38 frames with the Tera-Tomo 3-dimensional engine. Binding potential for caudate nucleus, putamen, and substantia nigra was evaluated using the simplified reference tissue model. Results: Radial full-width half-maximum resolution using Fourier rebinning and a 2-dimensional filtered backprojection algorithm was less than 2.2 mm and less than 3.2 mm in the central 60-mm-diameter and 140-mm-diameter regions, respectively. Maximum sensitivity in the 400- to 600-keV and 250- to 750-keV energy windows was 30.03 cps/kBq (3.3%) and 49.11 cps/kBq (5.4%), respectively. The uniformity in the image-quality phantom was 3.3%, and the spillover ratio for air and water was 0.1. The peak of the NECR curve was 430 kcps (at 115 MBq) with the ratlike phantom and 78 kcps (at 139 MBq) with the monkeylike phantom. Rods of the Derenzo phantom with 1-mm diameter could be distinguished by eye. In the NHP experiment, binding potentials in the caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra (4.9, 4.9, and 1, respectively) were similar to those previously reported using the same radioligand and a high-resolution research tomograph. Conclusion: The results obtained from phantom experiments and 1 representative PET measurement in an NHP confirm that the LFER 150 is a high-resolution PET/CT system with suitable performance for brain imaging in NHPs.

In vitro stability was determined in PBS and plasma, and with liver microsomal enzymes. Metabolite studies were performed using rat brain extracts, blood and urine. In vitro autoradiography was performed on horizontal slices of rat brain using 1 and 8, antagonists for mGlu(5) and mGlu(1), respectively. Small-animal PET, biodistribution, and test-retest studies were performed in Wistar rats. In vivo, dose-dependent displacement studies were performed using 6 and blocking studies with 7. [F-18]5 was obtained in decay-corrected maximal radiochemical yield of 37 % with a specific activity of 80 - 400 GBq/mu mol. Treatment with rat and human microsomal enzymes in vitro for 60 min resulted in 20 % and 4 % of hydrophilic radiometabolites, respectively. No hydrophilic decomposition products or radiometabolites were found in PBS or plasma. In vitro autoradiography on rat brain slices showed a heterogeneous distribution consistent with the known distribution of mGlu(5) with high binding to hippocampal and cortical regions, and negligible radioactivity in the cerebellum. Similar distribution of radioactivity was found in PET images. Under displacement conditions with 6, reduced [F-18]5 binding was found in all brain regions except the cerebellum. 7 reduced binding in the striatum by 84 % on average. Test-retest studies were reproducible with a variability ranging from 6.8 % to 8.2 %. An extended single-dose toxicity study in Wistar rats showed no compound-related adverse effects. The new mGlu(5) radiotracer, [F-18]5, showed specific and selective in vitro and in vivo properties and is a promising radioligand for PET imaging of mGlu(5) in humans.

It has been demonstrated in membrane preparations of rat brain that 10 mu M tetrapeptide did not compete with [H-3]naloxone for its binding site on the opioid receptors which differentiates it from typical opioids. In the first set of experiments, the stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding by the tetrapeptide to membrane preparations of recombinant cell lines expressing human mu, delta, and kappa receptors has been investigated. The specific [S-35]GTP gamma S binding did not change in the presence of 100 mu M tetrapeptide and DAMGO, DPDPE, or U-69593 at submaximal and maximal concentrations, indicating that the tetrapeptide was not an agonist or antagonist of the opioid receptors and it did not stimulate or blocked the stimulation of G-proteins coupled to these receptors. Studies with naloxone and naloxone methiodide pretreatment suggested that the tetrapeptide was either directly or indirectly affected by a naloxone-binding site located primarily within the central nervous system and to a lesser extent in the periphery. Naloxone pretreatment had a dual effect on morphine antinociception based on the concentration used. At 2 mg/kg, naloxone competed reversibly with 25 mg/kg morphine on its binding site on the opioid receptors, while at 5.4 mg/kg it blocked antinociception induced by 10 mg/kg morphine, 2.7 mg/kg aspirin, or 75 mg/kg tetrapeptide. These data suggest that a new naloxone-binding site is involved in alleviation of pain by at least three classes of analsegics (opioids, cycloogenase 2 inhibitors, and the tetrapeptide). The biological activity of the peptide was discovered first and the mechanism of action is now being studied. In an attempt to identify the therapeutic target of the tetrapeptide, a total of 23 radioligand binding assays to targets within the CNS were conducted. The results of these assays were negative and they reinforce the notion that the tetrapeptide activates an unknown mechanism involved in pain perception after surgery.

Cancer cells develop beside and depend on the complex tumor microenvironment. Cancer-associated fibroblasts, with their complex interaction with tumor and immune cells, are involved in various steps of tumorigenesis, such as growth, invasion, metastasis, and treatment resistance. Prooncogenic cancer-associated fibroblasts emerged as attractive therapeutic targets. However, clinical trials have achieved suboptimal success. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) inhibitor-based molecular imaging has shown encouraging results in cancer diagnosis, making them innovative targets for FAP inhibitor-based radionuclide therapies. This review summarizes the results of preclinical and clinical FAP-based radionuclide therapies. We will describe advances and FAP molecule modification in this novel therapy, as well as its dosimetry, safety profile, and efficacy. This summary may guide future research directions and optimize clinical decision-making in this emerging field.

PSMA-PET/CT imaging is emerging as a standard of care in prostate cancer imaging and has been included in recent NCCN guidelines, yet its wide access is still an issue because (68)Gallium labelled PSMA tracer needs "high financial costs" to purchase (68)Gallium generator and labelling equipment. In addition, the (18)Fluorinated labelled PSMA tracer, needs the PET/CT site to be "in close vicinity" to a cyclotron supplying the tracer. On the contrary, Technetium generators and SPECT machines are widely available in healthcare facilities throughout the world due to their lower cost. This pictorial essay highlights our initial experience using Tc-99m-PSMA SPECT, which supports further investigation as it is showing encouraging results for prostate cancer imaging and could also play a role in pre-radioligand therapy assessment in the future.

Methods: Twelve patients were assessed with PET and the high-affinity dopamine D3 receptor radioligand [C-11]-propyl-hexahydro-naphtho-oxazin ([C-11]-PHNO). Severity of sleep problems was rated with appropriate subitems of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part I (patient questionnaire) and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Results: We found that lower dopamine D3 receptor availability measured with [11C]-PHNO PET was associated with greater severity of excessive daytime sleepiness but not with problems of falling asleep or insomnia. Conclusion: In our cohort of patients with PD, the occurrence of excessive daytime sleepiness was linked to reductions in hypothalamic dopamine D3 receptor availability. If these preliminary findings are confirmed in larger cohorts of patients with polysomnographic characterization, selective pharmacologic modulation of the dopaminergic D3 system could be used to increase daytime alertness in patients with PD.

However, the affinity of many ligands is influenced by a common polymorphism in TSPO, in which an alanine at position 147 is replaced by threonine, thereby complicating the use of several radioligands for clinical diagnosis. In contrast, the best-characterized TSPO ligand (R)-PK11195 binds with similar affinity to both variants of mitochondrial TSPO (wild-type and A147T variant). Here we report the H-1, C-13, N-15 backbone and side-chain resonance assignment of the A147T polymorph of TSPO from Mus Musculus in complex with (R)-PK11195 in DPC detergent micelles. More than 90 % of all resonances were sequence-specifically assigned, demonstrating the ability to obtain high-quality spectral data for both the backbone and the side-chains of medically relevant integral membrane proteins.

Among the above compounds, 2-(2-((dimethylamino)methyl)-4-fluorophenoxy)-5-bromobenzenamine (15) and 2-(2-((dimethylamino)methyl)-4-fluorophenoxy)-5-iodobenzerie amine (16) show high binding affinities for the SERT with K-i values of 0.28 and 0.20 nmol center dot L-1, respectively. They can be further labeled with carbon-11, fluorine-18, iodine-123 or bromine-76, and evaluated as useful imaging agents for the SERT. Moreover, the study of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) provides some useful information for the future design of new ligands.

In addition to the similar to20 chemokine receptors that have been cloned and described, various orphan receptors with a chemokine receptor-like structure are known. We have investigated the orphan mouse chemokine receptor (L-CCR) in HEK 293 cells, a receptor that was originally described in a mouse macrophage cell line. Cells expressing this receptor show pertussis toxin-sensitive chemotaxis and small intracellular calcium transients in response to the chemokines CCL2, CCL7, CCL8, and CCL5. Biotinylated CCL2 binds to L-CCR-expressing cells, and transfection experiments with an L-CCR-green fluorescent protein fusion protein showed L-CCR expression in the membranes of recombinant HEK 293 cells. Although radioligand binding was not detected, it is suggested that L-CCR is a functional chemokine receptor.

Single Step Determination of Unlabeled Compound Kinetics Using a Competition Association Binding Method Employing Time-Resolved FRET	RATIONAL DRUG DESIGN: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS	Methods in Molecular Biology		English	Article; Book Chapter						Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer; Competition association binding kinetics; Fluorescent ligand; Terbium cryptate; SNAP-tagged GPCR; Association rate; Dissociation rate	RADIOLIGAND; RATES; ASSAY	The competition association binding method allows the characterization of the kinetics of unlabeled compounds and the calculation of receptor-drug affinity (K-d). The K-d value is defined as the ratio of the dissociation constant (or k(off)) of the receptor-bound ligand to its association rate constant (or k(on)) for a system at equilibrium. Traditionally, competition association binding experiments have been carried out using radiometric detection methods with limited assay throughput. Here we describe a novel method for the determination of unlabeled compound kinetics using the technique of time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) performed at physiological temperature and sodium ion concentration. Based on a traditional screening format (10-point curves), up to 28 compounds can be tested on a single 384-well plate by this method.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effect of sinomenine on opioid mu-receptor (OMR). In Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell transfected with OMR, the binding of [H-3]naloxone was displaced by sinomenine in a concentration-dependent manner. This compound also raised the phosphorylation of OMR in these cells. In a tail-flick test, sinomenine produced dose-dependent antinociception in mice, which was dose-dependently inhibited by pretreatment of naloxonazine, a selective OMR antagonist. Long-term pretreatment with sinomenine may delay the analgesic tolerance of morphine. The obtained results suggest that sinomenine has an ability to activate OMR, implicating the potential of sinomenine to be applied in clinic. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this paper, the radiosynthesis of befloxatone was investigated and orientated towards the preparation of multi milliCuries of radiotracer. Typically, using no-carrier-added [C-11]phosgene, 150-3OOmCi (5.55-11.10GBq) of [C-11]befloxatone was obtained within 20min of radiosynthesis (including HPLC purification) with specific radioactivities ranging from 500 to 2000mCi/mumol (18.5-74.0 GBq/mumol). The high efficiency of these radiosyntheses allows for multi-injection protocols and kinetic approaches for absolute quantification of the tracer. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

Indeed, these highly complex glycoprotein hormones, including pituitary lutropin (LH) and follitropin (FSH), are heterogeneous in terms of both peptidic and carbohydrate moieties, and, as a consequence, the bioactivity of the different molecular forms often does not match their immunoreactivity. In this article, we review the different types of LH and FSH bioassays. conventional methods for measuring FSH bioactivity are first described and include the in vivo Steelman and Pohley bioassay, the radioligand receptor assays (RRAs), the in vitro Sertoli cell bioassay, the in vitro granulosa cell bioassay, and the inhibin immunoassay. Recent methods based on cell lines transfected with cloned receptors, particularly the human FSH receptor, are then described. Methods for developing these assays are presented, and the advantages and disadvantages of the different bioassays are discussed. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The aim of this work was to study the biodistribution of the domestic radiopharmaceutical Lu-177-DOTA-PSMA in BALB/c nu/nu (nude) mice with subcutaneously transplanted human prostate carcinoma 22Rv1. Lu-177-DOTA-PSMA was administered intravenously (0.30 MBq/mouse). Uptake of Lu-177-DOTA-PSMA in organs and tissues was calculated in percent of the injected dose. It was shown that the tumor concentration of Lu-177-DOTA-PSMA decreased from 2.46 +/- 0.15%/g to 0.020 +/- 0.007%/g within 120 h. The highest concentration of Lu-177-DOTA-PSMA (up to 14.578 +/- 1.151%/g) was registered in the kidneys. Rapid elimination of Lu-177-DOTA-PSMA from other organs was also observed.	[Tishchenko, V.

Rescue of mutant gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor function independent of cognate receptor activity	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; IDENTIFICATION; ASSAY; MODULATORS; PHARMACOPERONES; TRAFFICKING; INHIBITORS; ETIOLOGY; IMPACT	Molecules that correct the folding of protein mutants, restoring their functional trafficking, are called pharmacoperones. Most are clinically irrelevant and possess intrinsic antagonist or agonist activity. Here, we identify compounds capable of rescuing the activity of mutant gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor or GnRHR which, is sequestered within the cell and if dysfunctional leads to Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism. To do this we screened the E90K GnRHR mutant vs. a library of 645,000 compounds using a cell-based calcium detection system. Ultimately, we identified 399 compounds with EC50 <= 5 mu M with no effect in counterscreen assays. Medicinal chemistry efforts confirmed activity of 70 pure samples and mode of action studies, including radioligand binding, inositol phosphate, and toxicity assays, proved that we have a series of tractable compounds that can be categorized into structural clusters. These early lead molecules rescue mutant GnRHR function and are neither agonist nor antagonists of the GnRHR cognate receptor, a feature required for potential clinical utility.

Shape-Based Reprofiling of FDA-Approved Drugs for the H<sub>1</sub> Histamine Receptor	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SMALL MOLECULES; IDENTIFICATION; 2D; OPTIMIZATION; VALIDATION; BLOCKADE; OMEGA	Reprofiling of existing drugs to treat conditions not originally targeted is an attractive means of addressing the problem of a decreasing stream of approved drugs. To determine if 3D shape similarity can be used to rationalize an otherwise serendipitous process, we employed 3D shape-based virtual screening to reprofile existing FDA-approved drugs. The study was conducted in two phases. First, multiple histamine H-1 receptor antagonists were identified to be used as query molecules, and these were compared to a database of approved drugs. Second, the hits were ranked according to 3D similarity and the top drugs evaluated in a cell-based assay. The virtual screening methodology proved highly successful, as 13 of 23 top drugs tested selectively inhibited histamine-induced calcium release with the best being chlorprothixene (IC50 1 nM). Finally, we confirmed that the drugs identified using the cell-based assay were all acting at the receptor level by conducting a radioligand-binding assay using rat membrane.

Identification of a Potent and Selective Cannabinoid CB, Receptor Antagonist from <i>Auxarthron reticulatum</i>	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Auxarthron reticulatum; amauromine; cannabinoid receptors; CB1; CB2; natural products	AMAUROMINE	The fungus Auxarthron reticulatum derived from the marine sponge Ircinia variabilis produced the diketopiperazine alkaloid amauromine (1) and the quinolinone methyl-penicinoline (2). Compound 2 is identical to the reported methyl-marinamide, whose structure is herewith revised. In radioligand binding studies at human cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, amaurorriine (1) was found to exhibit high affinity and selectivity for the CB1 receptor (K-i = 178 nM). The compound was shown to be a neutral CB1 antagonist with a K-b value of 66.6 nM determined in cAMP assays. Compound 2 exhibited only weak or no effects at CB receptors. To the best of our knowledge, compound 1 is the first fungal natural product that shows affinity for cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Because of its high antagonistic potency and selectivity, it may have potential for use as a drug and/or serve as a lead structure for drug development.

In order to investigate the role of cerebral benzodiazepine-receptor binding in SPS, we performed [C-11]flumazenil (FMZ) positron emission tomography (PET) in a female patient with SPS compared to nine healthy controls. FMZ is a radioligand to the postsynaptic central benzodiazepine receptor which is co-localized with the GABA-A receptor. In the SPS patient, we found a global reduction of cortical FMZ binding. In addition, distinct local clusters of reduced radiotracer binding were observed. These data provide first in vivo evidence for a reduced postsynaptic GABA-A receptor availability which may reflect the loss of GABAergic neuronal inhibition in SPS.

In human brain they are highly expressed in striatum, where they co-exist and co-function with adenosine A(1), glutamate mGlu(5) and dopamine D-2 receptors. As glutaminergic neurotransmission modulators in GABAergic enkephalinergic neurons, adenosine A(2A) receptors are attractive targets for new, alternative therapies of neurodegenerative disorders, like Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The aim of the research was to obtained fluorescently tagged adenosine A(2A) receptors. Gene encoding human adenosine A(2A) receptor was inserted into plasmid pEYFP-N1, bearing enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP). The construct was expressed in HEK 293 cells. Fluorescence was observed by flow cytometry and epifluorescence microscopy.

Of the compounds tested, 3-(2,4-dihydroxybenzylidene)myosmine 3 and 3-(4-hydroxybenzylidene)myosmine 4 displayed the highest potency, with IC50 values of 0.120 and 0.310 mu M, respectively. 3-(4-Dimethylaminobenzylidene)myosmine 15 with a para-dimethylamino group on the benzylidene moiety displayed moderate affinity (IC50= 5.49 mu M). On the other hand, cinnamylidene analogues, 3-(4-dimethylamino-cinnamylidene)myosmine 16 and 3-cinnamylidenemyosmine 17, displayed moderate affinity, with IC50 values of 2.07 and 3.52 mu M, respectively.

PF-06684511 was identified as a candidate PET ligand for imaging BACE1 in the brain and showed high specific binding in an initial assessment in a nonhuman primate (NHP) PET study using F-18-PF-06684511. In this effort, we aimed to quantitatively evaluate the regional brain distribution of F-18-PF-06684511 in NHPs under baseline and blocking conditions and to assess the target occupancy of BACE1 inhibitors. In addition, NHP whole-body PET measurements were performed to estimate the effective radiation dose. Methods: Initial brain PET measurements were performed at baseline and after oral administration of 5 mg/kg of LY2886721, a BACE1 inhibitor, in 2 cynomolgus monkeys. Kinetic analysis was performed with the radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. In addition, a wide dose range of another BACE1 inhibitor, PF-06663195, was examined to investigate the relationship between the brain target occupancy and plasma concentration of the drug. Finally, the effective radiation dose of F-18-PF-06684511 was estimated on the basis of the whole-body PET measurements in NHPs. Results: Radiolabeling was accomplished successfully with an incorporation radiochemical yield of 4%-12% (decay-corrected) from F-18 ion. The radiochemical purity was greater than 99%. The whole-brain uptake of F-18-PF-06684511 peaked (similar to 220% SUV) at approximately 20 min and decreased thereafter (similar to 100% SUV at 180 min). A 2-tissue-compartment model described the time-activity curves well. Pretreatment with LY2886721 reduced the total distribution volume of F-18-PF-06684511 by 48%-80% depending on the brain region, confirming its in vivo specificity. BACE1 occupancy of PF-06663195, estimated using the Lassen occupancy plot, showed a dose-dependent increase. The effective dose of F-18-PF-06684511 was 0.043 mSv/MBq for humans. Conclusion: F-18-PF-06684511 is the first successful PET radioligand for BACE1 brain imaging that demonstrates favorable in vivo binding and brain kinetics in NHPs.

Head-to-Head Comparison of <SUP>11</SUP>C-PBR28 and <SUP>18</SUP>F-GE180 for Quantification of the Translocator Protein in the Human Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						C-11-PBR28; F-18-GE180; TSPO	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; ASSESS RADIATION SAFETY; IN-VIVO; 18 KDA; PET RADIOLIGAND; TSPO PET; SUGGESTED PATHWAY; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; MODEL	F-18-GE180 is a third-generation PET tracer for quantifying the translocator protein (TSPO), a biomarker for inflammation. The aim of this study was to perform a head-to-head comparison of F-18-GE180 and the well-established TSPO tracer C-11-PBR28 by scanning with both tracers during the same day in the same subjects. Methods: Five subjects underwent a 90-min PET scan with C-11-PBR28 in the morning and F-18-GE180 in the afternoon. A metabolite-corrected arterial input function was obtained in each subject for both tracers, and the brain uptake was quantified with a 2-tissue-compartment model. Results: The rate of metabolism of F-18-GE180 in arterial blood was slower than that of C-11-PBR28 (the percentages of non-metabolized parent in plasma at 90 min were 74.9%+/- 4.15%[mean +/- SD] and 11.2% +/- 1.90%, respectively). The plasma free fractions were similar for both tracers: 3.5% +/- 1.1% for F-18-GE180 and 4.1% +/- 1.1% for C-11-PBR28. The average total volume of distribution (VT) of F-18-GE180 was about 20 times smaller than that of C-11-PBR28 (0.15 +/- 0.03 mL/cm(3) for F-18-GE180 and 3.27 +/- 0.66 mL/cm(3) for C-11-PBR28). F-18-GE180 was characterized by poor transfer from the vascular compartment to the brain (its plasma-to-tissue rate constant [K1] was about 10 times smaller than that of C-11-PBR28). Moreover, kinetic modeling was more difficult with F-18-GE180, as its VT values were identified with a lower precision than those of C-11-PBR28 and outlying values were more frequent. Conclusion: The VT of F-18-GE180 was about 20 times smaller than that of C-11-PBR28 because of low penetration into the brain from the vascular compartment. In addition, kinetic modeling of F-18-GE180 was more challenging than that of C-11-PBR28. Therefore, compared with C-11-PBR28, F-18-GE180 had unfavorable characteristics for TSPO imaging of the brain.

We performed tracer kinetic analysis in various brain regions to determine the optimum equilibrium time for SERT quantification with [I-123]ADAM and SPECT. Radiosyntheses of [I-123]ADAM were performed at MAP Medical Technologies Oy, Tikkakoski, Finland. Thirty healthy male volunteers (21-41 yr) received between 104 and 163 MBq [(II)-I-123]ADAM intravenously as a bolus. Consecutively, multiple SPECT scans were performed between 14 and 420 min post-injection (p.i.) using a Siemens Multispect 3 camera. Reconstruction was performed applying filtered back projection with a Butterworth filter (cut-off 0.7, order 7) in 128 x 128 matrices. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn manually on the individual T-1-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) comprising midbrain/ hypothalamus for specific binding to SERT, and the cerebellum as reference region. After re-orientation to the MRI, the ROI template was applied to SPECT studies. We generated time-activity curves for the ROI and calculated the ratio counts(target)/counts(cerebullum) minus 1 (=V3") as a measure for specific SERT binding. Counts were corrected for applied activity, acquisition time and body-weight. Peak uptakes were observed between 14 and 50 min after bolus injection. Counts per voxel were highest in the midbrain/ hypothalamus, 798 (max. 872, min. 728), whereas 462 counts per voxel (max. 599, min. 412) were measured in the cerebellum at a mean time of 31 min p.i. Stable values for VY reached 205-320 min p.i. Mean peak VY value was 1.43 (95% CI 171-230) for the midbrain /hypothalamus at 205 min p.i. [I-123]ADAM is a useful ligand for in-vivo quantification of human SERT by means of SPECT, with a comparatively better signal-to-noise ratio compared to beta-CIT. Our data suggest that the acquisition time for the SPECT scan is optimally, under pseudo-equilibrium conditions, between 205-320 min post-bolus injection of the tracer.

Pharmacological profile of the "triple" monoamine neurotransmitter uptake inhibitor, DOV 102,677	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						antidepressant; dopamine; norepinephrine; serotonin; transporter; microdialysis; forced swim test; prepulse inhibition	DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; NOREPINEPHRINE-TRANSPORTER; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RAT; RELEASE; H3-NOREPINEPHRINE; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; ATOMOXETINE; MECHANISM; COCAINE	1. The molecular and behavioral pharmacology of DOV 102,677 is characterized. 2. This characterization was performed using radioligand binding and neurotransmitter uptake assays targeting the monoamine neurotransmitter receptors. In addition, the effects of DOV 102,677 on extracellular neurotransmitter levels were investigated using in vivo microdialysis. Finally, the effects of DOV 102,677 in the forced swim test, locomotor function, and response to prepulse inhibition was investigated. 3. DOV 102,677 is a novel "triple" uptake inhibitor that suppresses [H-3]dopamine (DA), [H-3]norepinephrine (NE) and [H-3]serotonin (5-HT) uptake by recombinant human transporters with IC50 values of 129, 103 and 133 nM, respectively. Radioligand binding to the dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), and serotonin (SERT) transporters is inhibited with k(i) values of 222, 1030, and 740 nM, respectively. DOV 102,677 (20 mg/kg IP) increased extracellular levels of DA and 5-HT in the prefrontal cortex to 320 and 280% above baseline 100 min after administration. DA levels were stably increased for the duration (240 min) of the study, but serotonin levels declined to baseline by 200 min after administration. NE levels increased linearly to a maximum of 348% at 240 min post-dosing. Consistent with these increases in NE levels, the density of beta-adrenoceptors was selectively decreased in the cortex of rats treated with DOV 102,677 (20 mg/kg per day, PO, 35 days). 4. DOV 102,677 dose-dependently reduced the amount of time spent immobile by rats in the forced swim test, a model predictive of antidepressant activity, with a minimum effective dose (MED) of 20 mg/kg and a maximal efficacy comparable to imipramine. This decrease in immobility time did not appear to result front increased motor activity. Further, DOV 102,677 was as effective as methylphenidate in reducing the amplitude of the startle response in juvenile mice, without notably altering motor activity. 5. In summary, DOV 102,677 is an orally active, "balanced" inhibitor of DAT, NET and SERT with therapeutic versatility in treating neuropsychiatric disorders beyond depression.

SB-706375 also reversed tone established in the rat aorta by prior exposure to hU-II (K-app similar to 20 nM). 5 SB-706375 was a selective U- II antagonist with >= 100-fold selectivity for the human UT receptor compared to 86 distinct receptors, ion channels, enzymes, transporters and nuclear hormones (K-i/IC50 > 1 mM). Accordingly, the contractile responses induced in isolated aortae by KCl, phenylephrine, angiotensin II and endothelin-1 were unaltered by SB-706375 (1 mM). 6 In summary, SB-706375 is a high-affinity, surmountable, reversible and selective nonpeptide UT receptor antagonist with cross-species activity that will assist in delineating the pathophysiological actions of U-II in mammals.

Human and animal experiments suggest the involvement of MORs in human sexual pleasure, yet this hypothesis currently lacks in vivo support. Methods: We used PET with the radioligand [11C]carfentanil, which has high affinity for MORs, to quantify endogenous opioid release after orgasm in man. Participants were scanned once immediately after orgasm and once in a baseline state. Hemodynamic activity was measured with functional MRI during penile stimulation. Results: The PET data revealed significant opioid release in the hippocampus. Hemodynamic activity in the somatosensory and motor cortices and in the hippocampus and thalamus increased during penile stimulation, and thalamic activation was linearly dependent on self-reported sexual arousal. Conclusion: Our data show that endogenous opioidergic activation in the medial temporal lobe is centrally involved in sexual arousal, and this circuit may be implicated in orgasmic disorders.

In recent years, imaging has gained increasing importance in the detection, staging, posttreatment assessment, and detection of recurrence of prostate cancer. Several imaging modalities including conventional and functional methods are used in different clinical scenarios with their very own advantages and limitations. This continuing medical education article provides an overview of available imaging modalities currently in use for prostate cancer followed by a more specific section on the value of these different imaging modalities in distinct clinical scenarios, ranging from initial diagnosis to advanced, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. In addition to established imaging indications, we will highlight some potential future applications of contemporary imaging modalities in prostate cancer.

The compounds are highly brain permeable, selective, reversible, and competitive monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors with improved water-solubility and subnanomolar potency (pIC(50) > 8.8). Using a well-validated, combined X-ray/modelling technology platform, we performed a semi-quantitative analysis of the binding modes of all compounds and investigated the role of the indazole N1 position for their MAO-B inhibitory activity. Moreover, compounds NTZ-1006, 1032, and 1441 were investigated for their ability to bind Fe2+ and Fe3+ ions using UV-visible spectroscopy.

Because substituents at the distal cyclopentadienyl ring are able to adjust the relative disposition that is required for ligand binding, disubstituted ferrocenes can act as molecular hinges. Taking advantage of click chemistry, the regioselective construction and functionalization of the target molecules is reported. Thus triazole derived appendages were used for the fine-tuning of biological activity and for the attachment of linker units generating bivalent GPCR ligands. Receptor binding was evaluated by radioligand displacement experiments, revealing superaffinity with sub- to single-digit nanomolar K-i values for particular test compounds. As a neutral antagonist at the dopamine receptors D3 and D4 and a potent partial agonist at the D2 subtype (intrinsic activity = 57%, EC50 = 2.5 nM), the bifunctional ferrocene 10b revealed a novel and unique activity profile.

BP is defined as a representative quantity of receptor density. However, for making parametric images of BP, a reference region where an aimed receptor has a very low density is assumed to exist in a target region such as the brain. Thus, if the kinetics of a radioligand for target receptors does not permit an appropriate reference region, BP imaging is unattainable. In this study, [C-11]SA4503 PET is taken to be considered which has a high affinity to the sigma(1) receptors. Through a clinical investigation using wide ranges of physiological situations, ages, sex, diseases, and selective drug-loading conditions, DVt has a good linear relationship with BP, and the images can be used as a spatial distribution of sigma(1) density.

Theranostic ligands are used to image disease or selectively deliver cytotoxic radioactivity to cells expressing PSMA according to the radioisotope conjugated to the ligand. PSMA theranostics is a rapidly advancing field that is now integrating into clinical management of prostate cancer patients. In this review we summarize published research describing the biological role(s) and activity of PSMA, highlight the most clinically advanced PSMA targeting molecules and biomacromolecules, and identify next generation PSMA ligands that aim to further improve treatment efficacy. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current state-of-play and a roadmap to achieving further advances in PSMA theranostics.

The compounds consisted of anilido piperidine and N-aryl piperazine moieties, joined by a variable-length methylene linker. The two moieties represent MOR and D(2)DAR pharmacophores, respectively. The synthesis encompassed four steps, securing the final products in 28-42 % overall yields. The approach has a considerable synthetic potential, providing access to various related structures. Pharmacological tests involved in vitro competitive assay for D(2)DAR using [H-3] spiperon, as a standard radioligand, and in vivo antinociceptive tests for MOR. The measured dopamine affinities were modest to low, while antinociceptive activity was completely absent. Therefore, the compounds of the general structure prepared in this research are unlikely to be useful as opioid-dopamine receptor heterobivalent ligands.

Recent studies have identified the G-protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30, GPER) as a high-affinity membrane receptor for 2-methoxyestradiol. However, studies aimed at establishing the binding affinities of steroid compounds for specific targets are difficult, as the tracers are highly lipophilic and often result in nonspecific binding in lipid-rich membrane preparations with low-level target receptor expression. 2-Methoxyestradiol binding studies are essential to elucidate the underlying effects of this novel estrogen metabolite and to validate its targets; therefore, this competitive receptor-binding assay protocol was developed in order to assess the membrane receptor binding and affinity of 2-methyoxyestradiol.

[C-11]1 was synthesized from [C-11]carbon monoxide, iodomethane and benzyl alcohol via palladium-mediated chemistry. The radiosynthesis was automated with a modified Synthia platform controlled with in-house developed Labview software. Under production conditions, [C-11]1 was obtained in 10% (n = 6) decay-corrected radiochemical yield from [C-11]carbon monoxide in >96% radiochemical purity and with an average specific radioactivity of 2415 mCi/mu mol. The total radiosynthesis time was about 45 min. Peak uptake of radioactivity in monkey brain (SW = 3.1) was relatively high and may be amenable to measuring uptake and metabolism of acetate in glial cells of the brain.

The present study investigated alterations in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)/glutamatergic and serotonergic receptors (using radioligand binding) induced by chronic treatment (14-day) with zinc hydroaspartate (65 mg/kg). Moreover, the mRNA and protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were also assessed. Chronic zinc administration reduced the affinity of glycine to glycine/NMDA receptors in the rat frontal cortex and increased the density of 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A serotonin receptors in the hippocampus and frontal cortex, respectively. These receptor alterations may be in part due to increased BDNF mRNA and protein levels in the rat frontal cortex. These results indicate that chronic zinc treatment alters glutamatergic and serotonergic systems, which is a hallmark of clinically effective antidepressants.

The new compounds are based on a quinoline core, appended with a required basic aminoethyl moiety, and with potency- and property-modulating heterocyclic substituents. The analogs have nanomolar and subnanomolar potency for the rat and human H3R in various in vitro assays, including radioligand competition binding as well as functional tests of H-3 receptor-mediated calcium mobilization and GTP gamma S binding. The compounds possessed favorable drug-like properties, such as good PK, CNS penetration, and moderate protein binding across species. Several compounds were found to be efficacious in animal behavioral models of cognition and attention. Further studies on the pharmaceutic properties of this series of quinolines discovered a potential problem with photochemical instability, an issue which contributed to the discontinuation of this series from further development.

A three-step solid-phase-supported sequence included reductive amination by N-phenylpiperazinyl-substituted alkylamines, N-acylation by alkynoic acids, and azide-alkyne [3 + 2] cycloaddition. In most cases, cleavage under acidic conditions yielded the final products in excellent purities. A focused library of 60 target compounds was screened for G-protein coupled receptor binding employing eight biogenic amine receptors. Radioligand displacement experiments indicated a number of hit compounds revealing excellent receptor recognition when the methyl-substituted N-benzyltriazoles 29, 40, and 42 exhibited superior affinities for the alpha 1 subtype (K-i = 0.056-0.058 nM).

A third melatonin binding site, MT3, is known with remarkable and distinct pharmacological properties. We previously reported the purification of MT3 and identified it as the enzyme dihydronicotinamide riboside:quinone reductase 2 (NQO2). To investigate the relationship between NQO2 and MT3, we generated a NQO2(-/-) mouse strain. These mice no longer present MT3 binding sites as measured with 2-[I-125]-iodo, 5-methoxycarbonylamino-N-acetyltryptamine, the specific MT3 radioligand. These data establish NQO2 as part of the MT3 binding sites in vivo and resolve the matter of the nature of the third melatonin binding site.

[I-125]-CNS 1261 was prepared by radioiodination of N-(1 naphthyl)-N'-(3-tributylstannyphenyl)-N'-methylguanidine using (NaI)-I-125 and peracetic acid. [I-125]-CNS 1261 uptake in vivo reflected NMDA receptor distribution in normal rat brain, whereas in ischemic rat brain, uptake was markedly increased in areas of NMDA receptor activation. Radiolabeled CNS 1261 appears to be a good candidate for further development as a single photon emission computed tomography tracer in the investigation of NMDA receptor activation in cerebral ischemia.

Translocator Protein as an Imaging Marker of Macrophage and Stromal Activation in Rheumatoid Arthritis Pannus	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						fibroblast-like synoviocytes; macrophages; translocator protein; positron emission tomography	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; COUNTER-FLOW ELUTRIATION; SYNOVIAL TISSUE; SUBCLINICAL SYNOVITIS; DISEASE-ACTIVITY; 18 KDA; EXPRESSION; CELLS; MONOCYTES; PET	PET radioligands targeted to translocator protein (TSPO) offer a highly sensitive and specific means of imaging joint inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Through high expression of TSPO on activated macrophages, TSPO PET has been widely reported in several studies of RA as a means of imaging synovial macrophages in vivo. However, this premise does not take into account the ubiquitous expression of TSPO. This study aimed to investigate TSPO expression in major cellular constituents of RA pannus-monocytes, macrophages, fibroblastlike synoviocytes (FLS cells), and CD4-positive (CD4+) T lymphocytes (T cells)-to more accurately interpret TSPO PET signal from RA synovium. Methods: Three RA patients and 3 healthy volunteers underwent PET of both knees using the TSPO radioligand C-11-PBR28. Through H-3-PBR28 autoradiography and immunostaining of synovial tissue in 6 RA patients and 6 healthy volunteers, cellular expression of TSPO in synovial tissue was evaluated. TSPO messenger RNA expression and H-3-PBR28 radioligand binding was assessed using in vitro monocytes, macrophages, FLS cells, and CD4+ T cells. Results: C-11-PBR28 PET signal was significantly higher in RA joints than in healthy joints (average SUV, 0.82 +/- 0.12 vs. 0.03 +/- 0.004; P < 0.01). Further, H-3-PBR28-specific binding in synovial tissue was approximately 10-fold higher in RA patients than in healthy controls. Immunofluorescence revealed TSPO expression on macrophages, FLS cells, and CD4+ T cells. The in vitro study demonstrated the highest TSPO messenger RNA expression and 3H-PBR28-specific binding in activated FLS cells, nonactivated M0 macrophages, and activated M2 reparative macrophages, with the least TSPO expression being in activated and nonactivated CD4+ T cells. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this study was the first evaluation of cellular TSPO expression in synovium, with the highest TSPO expression and PBR28 binding being found on activated synovial FLS cells and M2 macrophages. TSPO-targeted PET may therefore have a unique sensitivity in detecting FLS cells and macrophage-predominant inflammation in RA, with potential utility for assessing treatment response in trials using novel FLS-cell-targeted therapies.

Palosuran inhibits binding to primate UT receptors in cell membranes but demonstrates differential activity in intact cells and vascular tissues	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						urotensin-II; UT; GPR14; SB-657510; palosuran; ACT-058362; G-protein-coupled receptor; diabetic nephropathy; antagonist	HUMAN UROTENSIN-II; TYPE-2 DIABETES-MELLITUS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE-CELLS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ANTAGONIST PALOSURAN; HEART-FAILURE; IN-VITRO; PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL ROLE; INCREASED EXPRESSION; TRANSGENIC MICE	Background and purpose: The recent development of the UT ligand palosuran (1-[2-(4-benzyl-4-hydroxy-piperidin-1-yl)ethyl]-3-(2-methyl-quinolin-4-yl)-urea sulphate salt) has led to the proposition that urotensin-II (U-II) plays a significant pathological role in acute and chronic renal injury in the rat. Experimental approach: In the present study, the pharmacological properties of palosuran were investigated further using a series of radioligand binding and functional bioassays. Key results: Palosuran functioned as a 'primate-selective' UT ligand in recombinant cell membranes (monkey and human UT K(i) values of 4 +/- 1 and 5 +/- 1 nM), lacking appreciable affinity at other mammalian UT isoforms (rodent and feline K(i) values > 1 mu M). Paradoxically, however, palosuran lost significant (10- to 54-fold) affinity for native and recombinant human UT when radioligand binding was performed in intact cells (K(i) values of 50 +/- 3 and 276 +/- 67 nM). In accordance, palosuran also exhibited diminished activity in hUT (human urotensin-II receptor)-CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells (IC(50) 323 +/- 67 nM) and isolated arteries (K(b)> 10 mu M in rat aorta; K(b) > 48.5 mM in cat arteries; K(b) > 1.6 mu M in monkey arteries; Kb 2.2 +/- 0.6 mM in hUT transgenic mouse aorta). Relative to recombinant binding Ki values, palosuran was subjected to a 392- to 690-fold reduction in functional activity in monkey isolated arteries. Such phenomena were peculiar to palosuran and were not apparent with an alternative chemotype, SB-657510 (2-bromo-N-[4-chloro-3-((R)-1-methyl-pyrrolidin-3-yloxy)-phenyl]-4,5-dimethoxybenzenesulphonamide HCl). Conclusions and implications: Collectively, such findings suggest that caution should be taken when interpreting data generated using palosuran. The loss of UT affinity/activity observed in intact cells and tissues cf. membranes offers a potential explanation for the disappointing clinical efficacy reported with palosuran in diabetic nephropathy patients. As such, the (patho) physiological significance of U-II in diabetic renal dysfunction remains uncertain.	[Behm, D. J.; Lai, J. M.; Wu, C.; Aiyar, N. V.; Ohlstein, E. H.; Douglas, S.

However, the mechanism of its anti-ischaemic action is still unclear. The aim of this work was to establish whether ranolazine exerts functional beta -adrenoceptor antagonist activity in the rat cardiovascular system. Radioligand binding studies were performed in rat hearts and guinea-pig lungs for beta (1)- and beta (2)-adrenoceptor affinity, respectively. Ranolazine had micromolar affinity for both beta (1)- and beta (2)-adrenoceptors (pK(i)5.8 and 6.3, respectively). Developed tension was measured in isolated rat left atria (electrically driven at 4 Hz) and cumulative concentration/response curves to (+/- )isoprenaline (0.01-1000 nM) constructed. Ranolazine (0.32-10 muM) surmountably but weakly antagonised isoprenaline-induced positive inotropic responses, with an apparent pA(2) of 5.85 (5.69-6.00) and a slope of -0.74 (-0.70 to -0.77). In bivagotomised, atropinised pithed rats, ranolazine per se evoked marked bradycardia at doses above 10 mg/kg i.v. (maximum variation at 80 mg/kg -125 +/- 15 bpm, n=6, P<0.001) by a mechanism apparently unrelated to blockade of <beta>(1)- or beta (2)-adrenoceptors. Cumulative incremental doses of (+/- )isoprenaline (0.63 ng/kg to 0.16 mg/kg i.v.) administered to pithed rats induced concomitant depressor and chronotropic responses. Animals received either vehicle (saline 0.9% i.v., n=12), atenolol (0.04-2.5 mg/kg i.v., n=6 per dose), ICI 118551 (0.01-0.63 mg/kg i.v., n=6 or 7 per dose), (+/- )propranolol (0.01-0.63 mg/kg i.v., n=6 per dose) or ranolazine (2.5-80 mg/kg i.v., n=6 or 7 per dose) 10 min prior to isoprenaline. Ranolazine dose-dependently and competitively antagonised isoprenaline-induced decreases in diastolic arterial pressure (DAP, dose ratio 12.2 with 80 mg/kg ranolazine) and increases in heart rate (HR, dose ratio 20.3 with 80 mg/kg ranolazine). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ranolazine behaves as a weak beta (1)- and beta (2)-adrenoceptor antagonist in the rat cardiovascular system.

However, the influence of the radioligand's albumin-binding affinity on the time profile of tumor uptake has been only partly addressed so far. Based on the previously identified N-epsilon-4-(4-iodophenyl)butanoyl-lysine scaffold, we designed "clickable" lysine-derived albumin binders (cLABs) and determined their dissociation constants toward albumin by novel assay methods. Structure-activity relationships were derived, and selected cLABs were applied for the modification of the somatostatin receptor subtype 2 ligand (Tyr3)octreotate. These novel conjugates were radiolabeled with copper-64 and subjected to a detailed in vitro and in vivo radiopharmacological characterization. Overall, the results of this study provide an incentive for further investigations of albumin binders for applications in endoradionuclide therapies.

Heparin molecularly imprinted surfaces for the attenuation of complement activation in blood	BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							CARDIOPULMONARY BYPASS; BIOMATERIAL; MODEL; COAGULATION; BINDING; PROTEIN; PLASMA	Heparin-imprinted synthetic polymer surfaces with the ability to attenuate activation of both the complement and the coagulation system in whole blood were successfully produced. Imprinting was achieved using a template coated with heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan known for its anticoagulant properties. The N,N'-diacryloylpiperazine-methacrylic acid copolymers were characterized using goniometry, AFM and XPS. The influence of the molecular imprinting process on morphology and template rebinding was demonstrated by radioligand binding assays. Surface hemocompatibility was evaluated using human whole blood without anticoagulants followed by measurement of complement activation markers C3a and sC5b-9 and platelet consumption as a surrogate coagulation activation marker. The observed low thrombogenicity of this copolymer combined with the attenuation of complement activation induced by the molecular imprint offer potential for the development of self-regulating surfaces with important potential clinical applications.

New chromene scaffolds for adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors: Synthesis, pharmacology and structure-activity relationships	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptors; Structure-activity relationship; Adenosine receptors; Knoevenagel condensation; Chromene scaffolds	ANTAGONISTS; DERIVATIVES; CHEMISTRY	In silico screening of a c ollection of 1584 academic compounds identified a small molecule hit for the human adenosine A(2A) receptor (pK(i) = 6.2) containing a novel chromene scaffold (3a). To explore the structure activity relationships of this new chemical series for adenosine receptors, a focused library of 43 2H-chromene-3-carboxamide derivatives was synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assays at human adenosine A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) receptors. The series was found to be enriched with bioactive compounds for adenosine receptors, with 14 molecules showing submicromolar affinity (pK(i) >= 6.0) for at least one adenosine receptor subtype. These results provide evidence that the chromene scaffold, a core structure present in natural products from a wide variety of plants, vegetables, and fruits, constitutes a valuable source for novel therapeutic agents.

A highly attractive approach to investigate and control GPCR dimerization may be provided by the exploration and characterization of bivalent ligands, which can act as molecular probes simultaneously binding two adjacent binding sites of a dimer. The synthesis of bivalent dopamine D-2 receptor ligands of type 1 is presented, incorporating the privileged structure of 1,4-disubstituted aromatic piperidines/piperazines (1,4-DAPs) and triazolyl-linked spacer elements. Radioligand binding studies provided diagnostic insights when Hill slopes close to two for bivalent ligands with particular spacer lengths and a comparative analysis with respective monovalent control ligands and unsyrnmetrically substituted analogues indicated a bivalent binding mode with a simultaneous occupancy of two neighboring binding sites.

We tested this hypothesis further and studied whether cortical dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability in vivo is associated with verbal memory as assessed with the revised Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS-R). Methods: Forty healthy Finnish subjects were evaluated according to the WMS-R and scanned with positron emission tomography (PET) and dopamine D2/D3 receptor radioligand [C-11]FLB457 for the measurement of cortical D2/D3 receptor binding. Results: WMS-R verbal memory and learning parameters did not significantly correlate with D2/D3 receptor binding potential (BPND) in the studied cortical regions. Conclusions: Our findings do not support a major role for cortical D2/D3 receptors in the regulation of verbal memory in healthy individuals. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

R116301 is a selective NK1 receptor antagonist. In this pilot study, [C-11]R116301 was evaluated as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for the NK1 receptor. Two dynamic PET studies were performed in three normal volunteers before and after a blocking dose of aprepitant. Data were analyzed using striatum to cerebellum standardized uptake value (SUV) ratios. Baseline SUV ratios at 60-90 min after injection ranged from 1.22 to 1.70. Following aprepitant administration, this specific signal was completely blocked. Aprepitant administration did not significantly affect uptake in cerebellum, confirming the absence of NK1 receptors in cerebellum. These preliminary results indicate that [C-11]R116301 has potential as a radioligand for in vivo assessment of NK1 receptors in the human brain.	[Wolfensberger, Saskia P. A.; van Berckel, Bart N.

The popularity of Ga-68-PSMA-11 as a radioligand tool for prostate cancer diagnosis has gained a major boost upon its FDA approval in December 2020. Development of an economically benign protocol for the synthesis of PSMA-11, using solution phase method, is particularly important to get a better access to this highly important and expensive Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API). The PSMA-11 synthesized using the protocol presented here, involves the use of flow reactor based catalytic hydrogenation as the key step. Using the method portrayed, PSMA-11 with purity >99.5% was achieved, while, radio labelling with Ga-68 afforded Ga-68-PSMA-11 with radiochemical purity >95%, which is appropriate for imaging applications.

Downregulation of TrkA/B/C receptors characterizes numerous neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormally expressed Trk receptors or chimeric Trk fusion proteins are also well-characterized oncogenic drivers in a variety of neurogenic and non-neurogenic human neoplasms and are currently the focus of intensive clinical research. Previously, we have described the clinical translation of a highly selective and potent carbon-11-labeled pan-Trk radioligand and the preclinical characterization of the optimized fluorine-18-labeled analogue, [F-18]TRACK, for in vivo Trk positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

They display pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyrimidine derivatives with rigidized aliphatic amines as warheads. The compounds were screened for H3R and H4R binding affinities in radioligand displacement assays and the most potent compounds were evaluated for H3R binding properties in vitro and in docking studies. The combination of a rigidized H3R warhead and the pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine scaffold resulted in selective activity at the H-3 receptor with a pK, value of 6.90 for the most potent compound. A bipiperidine warhead displayed higher affinity than a piperazine or morpholine motif, while a naphthyl moiety in the arbitrary region increased affinity compared to a phenyl derivative. The compounds can be starting points for novel, simply synthesized histamine H-3 receptor ligands.

A major challenge is to quantitatively image myelin distribution in the central: nervous system. For this reason, we designed and synthesized a series of fluorinated radioligands that can be radiolabeled as radiotracers for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of myelin. These newly developed radioligands readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier and selectively bind to myelin membranes in the white matter region. Structure-activity relationship studies of such ligands suggested that optimal permeability could be achieved with calculated lipophilicty in the range of 3-4. After radiolabeling with fluorine-18, the brain uptake and retention of each radioligand were determined by microPET/CT imaging studies. These pharmacokinetic studies led us to identify a lead compound ([F-18]PMeDAS, 32) with promising in vivo binding properties, which was subsequently validated by ex vivo autoradiography.

When complexed with the TSPO-specific radioligand (R)-PK11195, TSPO folds into a rigid five-helix bundle. However, little is known about the structure and dynamics of TSPO in the absence of high-affinity ligands. By means of NMR spectroscopy, we show that TSPO exchanges between multiple conformations in the absence of (R)-PK11195. Extensive motions on time scales from pico- to microseconds occur all along the primary sequence of the protein, leading to a loss of stable tertiary interactions and local unfolding of the helical structure in the vicinity of the ligand-binding site. The flexible nature of TSPO highlights the importance of conformational plasticity in integral membrane proteins.

They represent a very promising class of potential drugs. The synthesis of novel 1,2,3,4,5,5a,6,10b-octahydroazepino[4,3-b]indoles and their interaction profiles measured on a series of 66 therapeutic targets including receptors, enzymes, and neuromediator transporters are described. The target recognition patterns of the compounds are compared with those of their bioisosteric analogs, diazoline (I) and Dimebon (TM) (II), which are 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-pyrido[4,3-b]indoles, in addition with those of 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexahydroazepino[4,3-b]indoles VIII and X. We show that different therapeutic targets exhibit different levels of sensitivity toward cis- and trans-configurations of the new structures. The new compounds exhibit affinity predominantly toward histamine H-1 and serotonin 5-HT2C receptors.	[Mit'kin, O. D.; Ivachtchenko, A. V.; Frolov, E. B.; Tkachenko, S. E.; Kazey, V. I.; Okun', I.

In the present study, bis-(8-isopropyl-isoquinolinium) derivatives (2a-e) were synthesized and tested for their affinity for cloned SK2 and SK3 channels in comparison with their 6,7-dimethoxy analogues (4a-f). Several ligands were investigated, both in flexible (propyl, butyl and pentyl) and rigid (m-or p-xylyl) series, the m-xylyl derivative (2d) having the best profile in terms of affinity and selectivity for SK3/SK2 channels. Molecular studies showed that the optimal conformation of compound 2d fits well with our SK pharmacophore model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 3,8-diazabicyclo[4.2.0]octane ligands, potent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ANALGESIC ACTIVITY; ABT-594 (R)-5-(2-AZETIDINYLMETHOXY)-2-CHLOROPYRIDINE; ANTINOCICEPTION; EPIBATIDINE; PYRIDINE; ANALOGS; BINDING; AGENT; A-84543; MICE	A series of potent neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) ligands based on a 3,8-diazabicyclo[4.2.0]octane core have been synthesized and evaluated for affinity and agonist efficacy at the human high affinity nicotine recognition site (h alpha 4 beta 2) and in a rat model of persistent nociceptive pain (formalin model). Numerous analogs in this series exhibit picomolar affinity in radioligand binding assays and nanomolar agonist potency in functional assays, placing them among the most potent nAChR ligands known for the h alpha 4 beta 2 receptor. Several of the compounds reported in this study (i.e., 24, 25, 28, 30, 32, and 47) exhibit equivalent or greater affinity for the h alpha 4 beta 2 receptor relative to epibatidine, and like epibatidine, many exhibit robust analgesic efficacy in the rat formalin model of persistent pain.

Assays are completed in a single well with no transfer, separation, or wash steps. The performance is suitable for high-throughput drug screening applications with regard to speed of analysis, magnitude of displaceable signal, precision, and sensitivity of various reagents. The rank order of potency of agonists and antagonists agrees well relative to the published radiometric filtration assays: DMe NPFF > NPFF > frog PP (Rana temporaria pancreatic polypeptide) > PQRFamide > BIBP 3226. The effect of highly colored compounds is very small on the polarization signal up to micromolar concentrations. The method serves as a simple and fast alternative to radioligand binding assays of antiobesity drug candidates related to NPFF receptors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Densitometric analysis indicated that GABA(B(1a)) mRNA levels were not significantly altered by an acute electroshock seizure, but that GABA(B(lb)) mRNA levels were significantly increased throughout the brain. GABA(B) receptor expression at this time point was unaffected by the seizure. The observed up-regulation of GABA(B(lb)) mRNA levels may imply increased importance of this splice variant in the regulation of further seizure activity.

Despite their pervasiveness, whether they are active on any targets has not been systematically explored. We computed the likelihood that approved excipients would bind to molecular targets. Testing in vitro revealed 25 excipient activities, ranging from low-nanomolar to high-micromolar concentration. Another 109 activities were identified by testing against clinical safety targets. In cellular models, five excipients had fingerprints predictive of system-level toxicity. Exposures of seven excipients were investigated, and in certain populations, two of thesemay reach levels of in vitro target potency, including brain and gut exposure of thimerosal and its major metabolite, which had dopamine D3 receptor dissociation constant K-d values of 320 and 210 nM, respectively. Although most excipients deserve their status as inert, many approved excipients may directly modulate physiologically relevant targets.

Immunotherapy is an established treatment for metastatic renal cell carcinoma and nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer, but its potential for treating prostate cancer (PCa) remains under investigation. Despite reported survival benefits, no published Phase III PCa trials using immunotherapy only as a treatment has demonstrated direct antitumor effects by reducing prostate-specific antigen levels. Subsequently, the thought of combining immunotherapy with other treatment modalities has gained traction as a way to achieving optimal results. Based on data from other malignancies, it is hypothesized that radiotherapy and immunotherapy can act synergistically to improve outcomes. We will discuss the clinical potential of combining immune-based treatments with radiotherapy as a treatment for advanced PCa.

Although in peripheral tissue, the radioligand binding (see appropriate chapter) allows to obtain well-defined receptor characteristic, and also is usable in some central nervous system regions, when trying to determine receptor binding in central nervous system regions with low density or with infinitesimally small receptor changes, the receptor autoradiography is a better method. The development of this method made important progress, and some different modes (phosphor imaging) are used nowadays. Here, we describe muscarinic receptor detection using different radioligands: [H-3]-QNB, [H-3]-NMS, [H-3]-pirenzepine, and [H-3]-AFDX-384. Specific attention is paid to the detection of subtypes of muscarinic receptors and the limits of the method are emphasized.

Binding Characteristics of Thyroid Hormone Distributor Proteins to Thyroid Hormone Metabolites	THYROID			English	Article						binding affinity; thyroid hormone distributor protein; thyroid hormone metabolites	THYROXINE-BINDING; RAPID STIMULATION; SERUM; ACID; TRANSTHYRETIN; ANALOGS; DIIODOTHYRONINES; HYPOTHESIS; AFFINITY; RECEPTOR	Background: In contrast to the thyroid hormones (THs) 3,3 ',5-triiodothyronine (T3) and 3,3 ',5,5 '-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine or T4), the binding characteristics of the thyroid hormone distributor proteins (THDP), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), albumin, and transthyretin in relation to TH metabolites are mostly lacking. In this study, we determined the distribution and binding affinity of TH metabolites to THDP, which is important for adequate interpretation of TH metabolite concentrations.Methods: Distribution of I-125-3,3 '-diiodothyronine (3,3 '-T2), -T3, -3,3 ',5 '-triiodothyronine (rT3), -3,3 ',5-triiodothyroacetic acid (TA3), and -3,3 ',5,5 '-tetraiodothyroacetic acid (TA4) to TBG, transthyretin, and albumin was determined by agar gel electrophoresis. The rank order of affinity (IC50) of TBG and transthyretin to thyronine (T0), 3-monoiodothyronine (3-T1), 3,5-diiodothyronine (3,5-T2), 3,3 '-T2, T3, rT3, T4, TA3, and TA4 was determined with a radioligand, competitive binding assay. In healthy subjects, associations of serum TBG, transthyretin, and albumin with TH and its metabolites were analyzed using multiple linear regression models, adjusted for sex and age.Results: While T3 and T4 are predominantly bound to TBG, we demonstrated that the predominant THDP of 3,3 '-T2 and rT3 is albumin, of TA3 is transthyretin and albumin, and of TA4 is transthyretin. With the radioligand binding assay, we showed that the rank order of affinity was T4>TA4 = rT3>T3>TA3 = 3,3 '-T2 > 3-T1 = 3,5-T2>T0 for TBG (IC50-range: 0.36 nM to >100 mu M) and TA4>T4 = TA3>rT3>T3 > 3,3 '-T2 > 3-T1 > 3,5-T2>T0 for transthyretin (IC50-range: 0.94 nM to >100 mu M). TBG, transthyretin, and albumin were not associated with T0, 3-T1, 3,3 '-T2, rT3, and TA4.Conclusions: Differences in serum TBG, transthyretin, and albumin concentrations within the reference interval do not influence serum concentrations of T0, 3-T1, 3,3 '-T2, rT3, and TA4. Distribution of TH metabolites between THDP differs from T4 and T3, which predominantly bind to TBG. The results from our study have potential clinical importance for adequate interpretation of TH metabolism in (patho)physiology.	[Jongejan, Rutchanna M. S.; van den Berg, Sjoerd A.

Evaluation of <SUP>11</SUP>C-BU99008, a PET Ligand for the Imidazoline<sub>2</sub> Binding Site in Human Brain	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						C-11-BU99008; imidazoline(2) binding site; I2BS; positron emission tomography; PET; BU99008	I-2-IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTORS; IDAZOXAN; DENSITY; PROTEINS; ALPHA(2)-ADRENOCEPTORS; ATTENUATION; TOLERANCE; MORPHINE; DISEASE	The imidazoline(2) binding site (I2BS) is thought to be expressed in glia and implicated in the regulation of glial fibrillary acidic protein. A PET ligand for this target would be important for the investigation of neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases. C-11-BU99008 has previously been identified as a putative PET radioligand. Here, we present the first in vivo characterization of this PET radioligand in humans and assess its test-retest reproducibility. Methods: Fourteen healthy male volunteers underwent dynamic PET imaging with C-11-BU99008 and arterial sampling. Six subjects were used in a test-retest assessment, and 8 were used in a pharmacologic evaluation, undergoing a second or third heterologous competition scan with the mixed I2BS/alpha(2)-adrenoceptor drug idazoxan (n = 8; 20, 40, 60, and 80 mg) and the mixed irreversible monoamine oxidase type A/B inhibitor isocarboxazid (n = 4; 50 mg). Regional time-activity data were generated from arterial plasma input functions corrected for metabolites using the most appropriate model to derive the outcome measure VT (regional distribution volume). All image processing and kinetic analyses were performed in MIAKAT. Results: Brain uptake of C-11-BU99008 was good, with reversible kinetics and a heterogeneous distribution consistent with known I2BS expression. Model selection criteria indicated that the 2-tissue-compartmentmodel was preferred. VT estimates were high in the striatum (105 +/- 21 mL.cm(-3)), medium in the cingulate cortex (62 +/- 10 mL.cm(-3)), and low in the cerebellum (41 +/- 7 mL.cm(-3)). Test-retest reliability was reasonable. The uptake was dose-dependently reduced throughout the brain by pretreatment with idazoxan, with an average block across all regions of about 60% (VT, similar to 30 mL.cm(-3)) at the highest dose (80 mg). The median effective dose for idazoxan was 28 mg. Uptake was not blocked by pretreatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor isocarboxazid. Conclusion: C-11-BU99008 in human PET studies demonstrates good brain delivery, reversible kinetics, heterogeneous distribution, specific binding signal consistent with I2BS distribution, and good test-retest reliability.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the response to and tolerability of a single dose of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in a large cohort of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Methods: The data of 82 consecutive patients (median age, 73 y; range, 43-87 y) with mCRPC who received a single dose of Lu-177-PSMA-617 (mean, 5.9 +/- 0.5 GBq) were retrospectively analyzed. Data were collected at baseline and 8 wk after therapy. Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT was performed on all patients to verify sufficient PSMA expression. Bone, lymph node, liver, and lung metastases were present in 99%, 65%, 17%, and 11% of the patients, respectively. Tolerability and response were evaluated using hematologic parameters, renal scintigraphy, clinical data, and the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at baseline and 8 wk after therapy application. Results: Six patients died, and 2 patients dropped out because they were not willing to continue therapy and follow-up. The complete dataset of 74 patients was available for analysis. Forty-seven patients (64%) showed a PSA decline, including 23 (31%) with a decline by more than 50%. Thirty-five patients (47%) had stable disease: the change in their PSA level ranged from less than a 50% decline to less than a 25% rise. Seventeen patients (23%) had progressive disease: their PSA level rose by more than 25%. There were no significant changes in hemoglobin, white blood cells, creatinine, or tubular extraction rates indicative of toxicity. There was a significant but mild decrease in platelets; but the median value was still within the reference range. Conclusion: This retrospective multicenter analysis suggests that radioligand therapy with Lu-177-PSMA-617 is safe and well tolerated and has a considerable effect on PSA level. Therefore, it offers an additional therapeutic option for patients with mCRPC. These data may justify further prospective randomized studies to evaluate and prove the clinical benefit in terms of survival and quality of life.

[H-3]MRE 2029-F20 bound specifically to the hA(2B) receptor stably transfected in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells with K-D of 2.8 +/- 0.2 nM and B-max of 450 +/- 42 fmol/mg of protein. Saturation experiments of [H-3]MRE 2029-F20 binding in human neutrophils and lymphocytes detected a single high-affinity binding site with K-D values of 2.4 +/- 0.5 and 2.7 +/- 0.7 nM, respectively, and B-max values of 79 +/- 10 and 54 +/- 8 fmol/mg of protein, respectively, in agreement with real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction studies showing the presence of A(2B) mRNA. The rank order of potency of typical adenosine ligands with recombinant hA(2B) receptors was consistent with that typically found for interactions with the A(2B) subtype and was also similar in peripheral blood cells. 5'-N-Ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine stimulated cAMP accumulation in both hA(2B)HEK293 and native cells, whereas phospholipase C activation was observed in recombinant receptors and endogenous subtypes expressed in neutrophils but not in lymphocytes. MRE 2029-F20 was revealed to be a potent antagonist in counteracting the agonist effect in both signal transduction pathways. In conclusion, [H-3]MRE 2029-F20 is a selective and high-affinity radioligand for the hA(2B) adenosine subtype and may be used to quantify A(2B) endogenous receptors. In this work, we demonstrated their presence and functional coupling in neutrophils and lymphocytes that play a role in inflammatory processes in which A(2B) receptors may be involved.

Thus far, studies towardthe downstream effects of A(3)AR activation have yieldedcontradictory results, thereby motivating the need for further investigations.Various chemical and biological tools have been developed for thispurpose, ranging from fluorescent ligands to antibodies. Nevertheless,these probes are limited by their reversible mode of binding, relativelylarge size, and often low specificity. Therefore, in this work, wehave developed a clickable and covalent affinity-based probe (AfBP)to target the human A(3)AR. Herein, we show validation ofthe synthesized AfBP in radioligand displacement, SDS-PAGE, and confocalmicroscopy experiments as well as utilization of the AfBP for thedetection of endogenous A(3)AR expression in flow cytometryexperiments. Ultimately, this AfBP will aid future studies towardthe expression and function of the A(3)AR in pathologies.	[Beerkens, Bert L.

Using a validated LC-ESI-MS/MS method for quantification of the selective dopamine transporter inhibitor (R,R)-4-(2-benzhydryloxyethyl)-1-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidin-3-ol ((R,R)-D-84), the selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitor (S,S)-reboxetine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (S)-citalopram, binding affinities at the three monoamine transporters could be characterized simultaneously in a single binding experiment. The performed simultaneous saturation and competition experiments yielded results that are in good accordance with those determined in MS Binding Assays addressing the monoamine transporters individually. The results obtained from this study underscore the potential of MS Binding Assays for simultaneous affinity determination at different targets, which is difficult to accomplish with conventional radioligand binding assays.

Taking into account molecular modeling results from a series of potent adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists, a pharmacophore was derived from which we show that a monocyclic core can be equally effective. To achieve a compound that may act at the GNS we propose imposing a restriction related to its polar surface area (PSA). In consequence, we have synthesized two novel series of pyrimidines, possessing good potency at the adenosine A, receptor and desirable PSA values. In particular, compound 30 (LUF 5735) displays excellent A, affinity (K-i = 4 nM) and selectivity (less than or equal to50% displacement of 1 muM concentrations of the radioligand at the other three adenosine receptors) and has a PSA value of 53 Angstrom2.

SCH-202676 inhibited radioligand binding to human adenosine A,, A(2A), and A(3) receptors (IC50 = 0.5-0.8 muM) and affected dissociation kinetics, but at the human P2Y(1) nucleotide receptor it had no effect. SCH-202676 (10 muM) selectively accelerated agonist dissociation at adenosine A3 receptors and either slowed (adenosine A(1) receptors) or accelerated (adenosine A(2A) receptors) antagonist dissociation. Thus, SCH-202676 differentially modulated A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptors as well as agonist- and antagonist-occupied receptors. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was to develop an antibody-based radioligand, using the Tribody(TM) format, for PET imaging of soluble amyloid-beta (All) protofibrils, which are suggested to cause neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease. Antibodies, even when expressed in smaller engineered formats, are large molecules that do not enter the brain in sufficient amounts for imaging purposes. Hence, their transport across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) needs to be facilitated, for example through interaction with the transferrin receptor (TfR). Thus, a Fab fragment of the TfR antibody 8D3 was fused with two single chain variable fragments (scFv) of the A beta protofibril selective antibody mAb158. Five Tribody proteins (A1-A5) were generated with different linkers between the Fab-8D3 and scFv-158. All proteins bound to TfR and All protofibrils in vitro. Three of the proteins (A1-A3) were radiolabeled with iodine-125 and studied ex vivo in wild-type (wt) and transgenic mice overexpressing human All. The systemic pharmacokinetics were similar with half-lives in blood of around 9 h for all three ligands. Brain concentrations at 2 h were around 1% of the injected dose per gram brain tissue, which is similar to what is observed for small molecular radioligands and at least 10-fold higher than antibodies in general. At 72 h, transgenic mice showed higher concentrations of radioactivity in the brain than wt mice (12, 15- and 16-fold for Al, A2 and A3 respectively), except in the cerebellum, an area largely devoid of A beta pathology. A3 was then labelled with iodine-124 for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Brain concentrations were quantified in six different regions showing a clear distinction both quantitatively and visually between wt and transgenic mice and a good correlation with A beta pathology. We have thus produced a recombinant, bispecific protein, actively transported into the brain, for PET imaging within the CNS. In a longer perspective, this technique may enable imaging of other proteins involved in neurodegenerative diseases for which imaging agents are completely lacking today.

Procedures Radioiodinated o-iodo-trans-decalinvesamicol ([I-125] OIDV) has a high binding affinity for vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) both in vitro and in vivo. Racemic [I-125] OIDV was separated into its two optical isomers (-)-[I-125] OIDV and (+)-[I-125] OIDV by HPLC. To investigate VAChT binding affinity (Ki) of two OIDV isomers, in vitro binding assays were performed. In vivo biodistribution study of each [I-125] OIDV isomer in blood, brain regions and major organs of rats was performed at 2,30 and 60 min post-injection. In vivo blocking study were performed to reveal the binding selectivity of two [I-125] OIDV isomers to VAChT in vivo. Ex vivo autoradiography were performed to reveal the regional brain distribution of two [I-125] OIDV isomers and (-)-[I-123] OIDV for SPECT at 60 min postinjection. Results VAChT binding affinity (Ki) of (-)-[I-125] OIDV and (+)-[I-125] OIDV was 22.1 nM and 79.0 nM, respectively. At 2 min post-injection, accumulation of (-)-[I-125] OIDV was the same as that of (+)-[I-125] OIDV. However, (+)-[I-125] OIDV clearance from the brain was faster than (-)-[I-125] OIDV. At 30 min post-injection, accumulation of (-)-[I-125] OIDV (0.62 +/- 0.10% ID/g) was higher than (+)-[I-125] OIDV (0.46 +/- 0.07% ID/g) in the cortex. Inhibition of OIDV binding showed that (-)-[I-125] OIDV was selectively accumulated in regions known to express VAChT in the rat brain, and ex vivo autoradiography further confirmed these results showing similar accumulation of (-)-[I-125] OIDV in these regions. Furthermore, (-)-[I-123] OIDV for SPECT showed the same regional brain distribution as (-)-[I-125] OIDV. Conclusion These results suggest that radioiodinated (-)-OIDV may be a potentially useful tool for studying presynaptic cholinergic neurons in the brain.
