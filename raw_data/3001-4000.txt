Method Five healthy male controls were included for two positron emission tomography (PET) studies: F-18-FCWAY PET after the pretreatment with 500 mg of disulfiram and two months later, F-18-Mefway PET without disulfiram. Regional time-activity curves (TACs) were extracted from nine cortical and subcortical regions in dynamic PET images. Using cerebellar cortex without vermis as reference tissue, in vivo kinetics for both radioligands were compared based on the distribution volume ratio (DVR) calculated by non-invasive Logan graphical analysis and area under the curve ratio of the TACs (AUC ratio). Result Although the pattern of regional uptakes in the F-18-Mefway PET was similar to that of the F-18-FCWAY PET (highest in the hippocampus and lowest in the cerebellar cortex), the amount of regional uptake in F-18-Mefway PET was almost half of that in F-18-FCWAY PET. The skull uptake in F-18-Mefway PET was only 25% of that in F-18-FCWAY PET with disulfiram pretreatment. The regional DVR values and AUC ratio values for F-18-Mefway were 17-40% lower than those of F-18-FCWAY. In contrast to a small overestimation of DVR values by AUC ratio values (< 10%) in F-18-FCWAY PET, the overestimation bias of AUC ratio values was much higher (up to 21%) in F-18-Mefway PET. Conclusion As F-18-Mefway showed lower DVR values and greater overestimation bias of AUC ratio values, F-18-Mefway may appear less favorable than F-18-FCWAY. However, in contrast to F-18-FCWAY, the resistance to in vivo defluorination of F-18-Mefway obviates the need for the use of a defluorination inhibitor. Thus, F-18-Mefway may be a good candidate PET radioligand for 5-HT1A receptor imaging in human.

Neurotensin Receptor Allosterism Revealed in Complex with a Biased Allosteric Modulator	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							RADIOLIGAND BINDING; STRUCTURAL BASIS; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM; SODIUM; DISCOVERY; GALLAMINE; MUTATION; AGONISTS; LIGAND	The NTSR1 neurotensin receptor (NTSR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) found in the brain and peripheral tissues with neurotensin (NTS) being its endogenous peptide ligand. In the brain, NTS modulates dopamine neuronal activity, induces opioid-independent analgesia, and regulates food intake. Recent studies indicate that biasing NTSR1 toward beta-arrestin signaling can attenuate the actions of psychostimulants and other drugs of abuse. Here, we provide the cryoEM structures of NTSR1 ternary complexes with heterotrimeric Gq and GoA with and without the brain-penetrant small-molecule SBI-553. In functional studies, we discovered that SBI-553 displays complex allosteric actions exemplified by negative allosteric modulation for G proteins that are G alpha subunit selective and positive allosteric modulation and agonism for beta-arrestin translocation at NTSR1. Detailed structural analysis of the allosteric binding site illuminated the structural determinants for biased allosteric modulation of SBI-553 on NTSR1.

Molecular Imaging of Neuroinflammation in HIV	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNE PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); HIV-associated neurocognitive impairment (HAND); Neuroinflammation; Positron emission tomography (PET); Translocator protein 18kDa; (TSPO)	VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; IN-VIVO; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; PET; ACTIVATION; MICROGLIA; DISEASE	The development of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) has increased the lifespan of persons living with HIV (PLWH), with most PLWH having a normal life expectancy. While significant progress has occurred, PLWH continue to have multiple health complications, including HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). While the exact cause of HAND is not known, persistent neuroinflammation is hypothesized to be an important potential contributor. Molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) can non-invasively evaluate neuroinflammation. PET radiotracers specific for increased expression of the translocator protein18kDa (TSPO) on activated microglia can detect the presence of neuroinflammation in PLWH. However, results from these studies have been inconsistent and inconclusive. Future studies are needed to address key limitations that continue to persist with these techniques before accurate conclusions can be drawn regarding the role of persistent neuroinflammation in PLWH.

The novel compounds mostly bear heterocyclic rings or bicyclic nucleus of differing lipophilicities. Compounds 18a and 19a,b demonstrated the highest sigma(1) affinity (K-i = 0.14-0.38 nM) with a good selectivity versus sigma(2) binding. Among them, 18a had the lowest C log D value (3.01) and only 19b was selective versus SI too. Generally, it was observed that more planar and hydrophilic heteronuclei conferred a decrease in affinity for both sigma receptor subtypes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) affects mainly women and is characterized histologically by a portal tract mononuclear cell infiltrate disrupting the limiting plate and invading the parenchyma ("interface hepatitis") and serologically by the presence of autoantibodies and increased levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG), in the absence of a known cause. AIH responds to immunosuppressive treatment. It can present insidiously or as an acute hepatitis. The previously accepted requirement of 6-month duration of symptoms before diagnosis can be made has been abandoned and treatment should be instituted as soon as the disease is diagnosed. In this review, we concentrate on those reports that add to our knowledge in terms of pathogenesis, differential diagnosis, treatment, and clinical course. Special attention is given to overlap syndromes. Curr Opin Gastroenterol 2001, 17:562-567 (C) 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

We aimed to investigate the feasibility of using a specific P2X7R-targeting F-18-labeled tracer [F-18]GSK1482160 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the quantification of AS.MethodsThe radioligand [F-18]GSK1482160 was obtained based on nucleophilic aliphatic substitution. Dynamic [F-18]GSK1482160 and [F-18]FDG micro-PET/CT imaging were performed on AS mice (n = 8) and age-matched controls (n = 8). Tracer kinetics modeling was performed using Logan's graphical arterial input function analysis to quantify the in vivo expression of P2X7R. The post-PET tissues were collected for hematoxylin-eosin (H & E), immunohistochemical (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF) staining.Results[F-18]GSK1482160 PET/CT imaging revealed that the specific binding in the ankle joint and sacroiliac joint (SIJ) of the AS at 8 weeks group (BPNDankle-AS-8W (non-displaceable binding potential of the ankle) 3.931 & PLUSMN; 0.74; BPNDSIJ-AS-8W (BPBD of the SIJ) 4.225 & PLUSMN; 0.84) were significantly higher than the controls at 8 weeks group (BPNDankle-Ctr-8W 0.325 & PLUSMN; 0.15, BPNDSJJ-Ctr-8W 0.319 & PLUSMN; 0.17) respectively, and the AS at 14 weeks group (BPNDankle-AS-14W 12.212 & PLUSMN; 2.25; BPNDSJJ-AS-14W 13.389 & PLUSMN; 3.60) were significantly higher than the controls at 14 weeks group (BPNDankle-Ctr-14W 0.204 & PLUSMN; 0.16, BPNDSJJ-Ctr-14W 0.655 & PLUSMN; 0.35) respectively. The four groups had no significant difference in the [F-18]FDG uptake of ankle and SIJ. IHC and IF staining revealed that the overexpression of P2X7R was colocalized with activated macrophages from the ankle synovium and spinal endplate in mice with AS, indicating that quantification of P2X7R may contribute to the understanding of the pathogenesis of inflammation in human AS.ConclusionThis study developed a novel P2X7R-targeting PET tracer [F-18]GSK1482160 to detect the expression of P2X7R in AS mouse models and provided powerful non-invasive PET imaging and quantification for AS.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeting beta- and alpha-emitters have been introduced, with promising response rates. Here, we present the first-to our knowledge-clinical data for PSMA-targeted a-therapy (TAT) using Ac-225-PSMA imaging and therapy (I&T). Methods: Fourteen patients receiving Ac-225-PSMA-I&T were included in this retrospective analysis. Eleven of the 14 had prior second-line antiandrogen treatment with abiraterone or enzalutamide, prior chemotherapy, and prior Lu-177-PSMA treatment. Patients were treated at bimonthly intervals until progression or intolerable side effects. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured for response assessment. Hematologic and nonhematologic side effects were recorded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 5.0. Results: Thirty-four cycles of 225 ACPSMA-I&T were applied (median dose, 7.8 MBq; range, 6.0-8.5), with 1 cycle in 3 patients, 2 cycles in 7 patients, 4 cycles in 3 patients, and 5 cycles in 1 patient. No acute toxicity was observed during hospitalization. Baseline PSA was 112 ng/mL (range, 20.5-818 ng/mL). The best PSA response after TAT (a PSA decline >= 50%) was observed in 7 patients, and a PSA decline of any amount was observed in 11 patients. Three patients had no PSA decline at any time. A subgroup analysis of 11 patients with prior Lu-177-PSMA treatment showed any PSA decline in 8 patients and a decline of at least 50% in 5 patients. After TAT, grade 3 anemia was observed in 3 of the 14 patients, with 2 of them presenting with grade 2 anemia already at baseline. Grade 3 leukopenia was observed in 1 patient. Eight patients with preexisting xerostomia after Lu-177-PSMA showed no worsening after TAT. Newly diagnosed grade 1 or 2 xerostomia after TAT was observed in 5 patients. One patient reported no xerostomia at all. Conclusion: Our first clinical data for TAT using Ac-225-PSMA-I&T showed a promising antitumor effect in advanced metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. These results are highly comparable to data on Ac-225-PSMA-617 TAT.

The effects of three heterocyclic allosteric modulators [ the imidazoquinoline 2-cyclopentyl-4-phenylamino-1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinoline (DU124183), the pyridinylisoquinoline 4-methoxy-N-[7-methyl-3-(2-pyridinyl)-1-isoquinolinyl]benzamide (VUF5455), and the amiloride analog 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride] on the dissociation of the agonist radioligand, N-6-(4-amino-3-[I-125]iodobenzyl)-5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine, were compared at wild-type (WT) and mutant A(3)ARs. The F182A(5.43) and N274A(7.45) mutations eliminated the allosteric effects of all three modulators but had little effect on agonist binding. The N30A(1.50) and D58N(2.50) mutations abolished the allosteric effects of DU124183 and VUF5455, but not HMA, whereas the D107N(3.49) mutation abolished the effects of DU124183, but not HMA or VUF5455. The T94A(3.36), H95A(3.37), K152A(EL2), W243A(6.48), L244A(6.49), and S247A(6.52) mutations did not influence allosteric effects of the modulators. Sodium ions (100 mM), which modulate agonist binding at a variety of receptors, caused an similar to80% inhibition of agonist binding in WT A(3)ARs but did not show any effect on D58N(2.50), D107N(3.49), and F182A(5.43) mutant receptors. In contrast, NaCl induced a modest increase of agonist binding in N30A(1.50) and N274A(7.45) mutant receptors. NaCl decreased the dissociation rate of the antagonist radioligand [H-3]8-ethyl-4-methyl-2-phenyl-(8R)-4,5,7,8-tetrahydro-1H-imidazo[2.1-i]purin-5-one (PSB-11) at the WT A(3)ARs, but not the D58N(2.50) mutant receptor. The results were interpreted using a rhodopsin-based molecular model of the A(3)AR to suggest multiple binding modes of the allosteric modulators.

In order to probe the specificity of muscarinic allosteric modulation, we checked whether these agents interact with histamine H-1-receptors which have a high homology with muscarinic receptors. Binding experiments (38 mM Na2HPO4, 12 mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5) were performed with the H-1-receptor antagonist [H-3]mepyramine ([H-3]MEP) in guinea pig cerebellar homogenates. For the sake of comparison, binding off [H-3]N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) at muscarinic M-2-receptors was measured in porcine cardiac homogenates under identical conditions. The modulators retarded [H-3]NMS dissociation (t(1/2,control)=1.3 min) concentration-dependently indicating their allosteric action with half-maximum effects for gallamine at EC50,diss=27 mu M, for alcuronium at EC50,diss=53 nM, and for W84 at EC50,diss=170 nM. In contrast, [H-3]MEP dissociation from H-1-receptors (t(1/2,control)=2.6 min) remained unchanged up to concentrations of 1 mM of the modulators. Equilibrium binding of [H-3]NMS (K-D=0.46 nM, B-max=98 fmol/mg protein) was inhibited by gallamine, elevated by alcuronium and left almost unchanged by W84, indicating negative, positive and nearly neutral cooperativity, respectively, with the radioligand. The ternary complex model of allosteric actions yielded the equilibrium dissociation constants K-A for the binding of the allosteric modulators to free M-2-receptors: K-A,K-gallamine=100 nM, K-A,K-alcuronium=450 nM, K-A,K-W84=69 nM. In H-1-receptors, more than 1000-fold higher concentrations than in M-2-receptors were required to elicit an effect on the binding of [H-3]MEP (K-D=1.2 nM, B-max=205 fmol/mg protein). Half-maximal reduction was observed at 10 mM for gallamine, 1 mM for alcuronium and 92 mu M for W84. In conclusion, the muscarinic modulators have little effect on the histamine H-1-receptors.

Quantification of radiopharmaceutical uptake in healthy organs from PSMA images has the potential to minimize toxicity by extrapolation of the radiation dose delivery towards personalization of therapy. However, segmentation and quantification of uptake in organs requires labor-intensive organ delineations that are often not feasible in the clinic nor scalable for large clinical trials. PurposeIn this work we develop and test the PSMA Healthy organ segmentation network (PSMA-Hornet), a fully-automated deep neural net for simultaneous segmentation of 14 healthy organs representing the normal biodistribution of [F-18]DCFPyL on PET/CT images. We also propose a modified U-net architecture, a self-supervised pre-training method for PET/CT images, a multi-target Dice loss, and multi-target batch balancing to effectively train PSMA-Hornet and similar networks. MethodsThe study used manually-segmented [F-18]DCFPyL PET/CT images from 100 subjects, and 526 similar images without segmentations. The unsegmented images were used for self-supervised model pretraining. For supervised training, Monte-Carlo cross-validation was used to evaluate the network performance, with 85 subjects in each trial reserved for model training, 5 for validation, and 10 for testing. Image segmentation and quantification metrics were evaluated on the test folds with respect to manual segmentations by a nuclear medicine physician, and compared to inter-rater agreement. The model's segmentation performance was also evaluated on a separate set of 19 images with high tumor load. ResultsWith our best model, the lowest mean Dice coefficient on the test set was 0.826 for the sublingual gland, and the highest was 0.964 for liver. The highest mean error in tracer uptake quantification was 13.9% in the sublingual gland. Self-supervised pretraining improved training convergence, train-to-test generalization, and segmentation quality. In addition, we found that a multi-target network produced significantly higher segmentation accuracy than single-organ networks. ConclusionsThe developed network can be used to automatically obtain high-quality organ segmentations for PSMA image analysis tasks. It can be used to reproducibly extract imaging data, and holds promise for clinical applications such as personalized radiation dosimetry and improved radioligand therapy.

Arterial blood sampling is indeed needed to create the IF (ASIF). In the present manuscript we study individualization of a population based input function (PBIF) with a single arterial manual sample to estimate total distribution volume (V-T) for [F-18] FEPPA and to replicate previously published clinical studies in which the ASIF was used. Methods The data of 3 previous [F-18] FEPPA studies (39 of healthy controls (HC), 16 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and 18 with Alzheimer's disease (AD)) was reanalyzed with the new approach. PBIF was used with the Logan graphical analysis (GA) neglecting the vascular contribution to estimate VT. Time of linearization of the GA was determined with the maximum error criteria. The optimal calibration of the PBIF was determined based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the IF and the agreement range of VT between methods. The shape of the IF between groups was studied while taking into account genotyping of the polymorphism (rs6971). Results PBIF scaled with a single value of activity due to unmetabolized radioligand in arterial plasma, calculated as the average of a sample taken at 60 min and a sample taken at 90 min post-injection, yielded a good interval of agreement between methods and optimized the area under the curve of IF. In HC, gray matter V(T)s estimated by PBIF highly correlated with those using the standard method ( r(2) = 0.82, p = 0.0001). Bland-Altman plots revealed PBIF slightly underestimates (similar to 1 mL/cm(3)) V-T calculated by ASIF (including a vascular contribution). It was verified that the AUC of the ASIF were independent of genotype and disease (HC, PD, and AD). Previous clinical results were replicated using PBIF but with lower statistical power. Conclusion A single arterial blood sample taken 75 minute post-injection contains enough information to individualize the IF in the groups of subjects studied; however, the higher variability produced requires an increase in sample size to reach the same effect size.

Here, we report a new luciferase reporter assay for ecdysone agonists. The assay employs mammalian HEK293T cells transiently transfected with the EcR and USP genes of Chilo suppressalis, along with the taiman (Tai) gene of Drosophila melanogaster that encodes a steroid receptor coactivator. This assay system gave results consistent with those of radioligand binding assays and showed sensitivity superior to that of the existing in vitro methods. In addition, use of the heterologous host cells precludes perturbation from intrinsic players of the ecdysone signaling, which is a potential drawback of insect cell-based methods. This reporter system is suitable for detailed structure-activity analysis of ecdysone agonists and will serve as a valuable tool for the rational design of novel insect growth regulators.

First Experiences with <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA Therapy in Combination with Pembrolizumab or After Pretreatment with Olaparib in Single Patients	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PSMA; Lu-177; pembrolizumab; olaparib		Synergistic effects of immunotherapy with pembrolizumab or drugs targeting DNA damage, such as olaparib, might be used to overcome the limitations of radioligand therapy (RLT) with 177Lu-prostatespecific membrane antigen (PSMA) in metastasized castration-resistant prostate cancer. Here, we present 2 patients receiving such combination or sequential therapies. Methods: RLT was performed at 6- to 8-wk intervals after the patients either exhausted or were considered unfit for all approved conventional treatments. Patient 1 was on pembrolizumab for his squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, whereas patient 2 received RLT sequentially 4 wk after 3 mo of monotherapy with olaparib. Results: Both patients tolerated RLT without any significant hematotoxicity. Patient 2 showed a radiologic and biochemical response, whereas patient 1 achieved prostate-specific antigen stabilization after 3 therapy cycles. Conclusion: These cases indicate that RLT in combination with pembrolizumab or sequentially after olaparib might be well tolerated in single patients.

A major part of this article is focused on molecular imaging in Alzheimer's disease where parietal, temporal and posterior cingulate cortex hypoperfusion and hypometabolism are the predominant findings in molecular imaging modalities. In cases of mild amnestic cognitive impairment, molecular SPET imaging can differentiate patients converting to Alzheimer's disease from non converters. Molecular SPET imaging with pre-synaptic dopamine receptors radioligand (I-123-ioflupane or DaTSCAN), is the method of choice in order to differentiate Alzheimer's disease from Lewy body dementia. Finally, nuclear medicine procedures support the diagnosis in fronto-temporal and multi-infarct dementia.

The 5-HT2 antagonists used in this study were sarpogrelate, ketanserin and cyproheptadine. The results showed that sarpogrelate and ketanserin had very weak binding affinities to M-2 muscarinic receptor, whereas cyproheptadine had higher binding affinity to this receptor than the muscarinic receptor antagonist, atropine. All of these three 5-HT2 antagonists as well as muscarinic receptor antagonists (atropine and pirenzepine) were readily dissociated from M-2 muscarinic receptor in rat heart membranes after washing. Therefore, the findings of the present investigation suggest that the dissociation potencies of neither 5-HT2 antagonists nor muscarinic antagonists used correlate with their binding affinities to M-2 muscarinic receptors in rat heart.

Diversity of the library was obtained by combining various functionalized monomers and cross-linkers and by varying the stoichiometry and the concentration of the components in the prepolymerization mixtures. The library was screened for selectivity to penicillin G by a radioligand binding assay and was compared to a corresponding control library. The best MIP candidate, showing the highest selectivity for penicillin G, was prepared from methacrylic acid and trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate as the functionalized monomer and cross-linker, respectively. Cross-reactivity studies with other beta-lactam antibiotics showed a low cross-reactivity of penicillin V (15%), ampicillin (16%), and amoxicillin (19%). Nafcillin and oxacillin showed less cross-reactivity (<1%). Cross-reaction with a cephalosporin antibiotic (cephapirin) and structurally nonrelated antibiotics (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, dapsone, and erythromycin) was less than 0.01%.

Compounds 7, characterized by methyl substitution on the N-1 indazole nucleus, generally exhibited significant antiarrhythmic, local anaesthetic and analgesic activities. The preliminary radioligand binding assay highlighted, in compounds 7, an interesting Pi-affinity which can be well correlated to their antiarrhyhtmic activity. Analogues 8 characterized by a phenyl group on the N-1 indazole nucleus, were generally less active as antiarrhyhtmic agents but generally interesting as local anaesthetics. Due to the importance of the indazole moiety as a carrier of antiphlogistic activity, the two classes of derivatives 7 and 8 were evaluated for their NSAID behaviour. Once again, compounds 7 resulted having more interesting analgesic and antipyretic effects than analogues 8.

Characterization of <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-labeled cytokine ligands for inflammation imaging via TNF and IL-1 pathways	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Tc-99m; Cytokines; Interleukin-1; Tumor necrosis factor; Inflammation; Imaging	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; INTERLEUKIN-1 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; HUMAN RECOMBINANT INTERLEUKIN-1; FACTOR-ALPHA; IN-VIVO; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; SKIN INFLAMMATION; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; MOUSE SKIN	Introduction: TNFR2-Fc and IL-1ra-Fc are recombinant cytokine ligands that target TNF and IL-1. TNFR2-Fc-IL-1ra, a dual-domain agent that incorporates both ligands, allows bifunctional binding of IL-1 receptors and TNF. This study was designed to characterize Tc-99m-labeled forms of these ligands, Tc-99m-IL-1ra-Fc (IF), Tc-99m-TNFR2-Fc (TF), and Tc-99m-TNFR2-Fc-IL-1ra (TFI), for inflammation imaging. Methods: The cytokine ligands were labeled with Tc-99m by a direct approach via 2-iminothiolane (2-IT) reduction at various 2-IT/protein molar ratios. In vivo inflammation targeting studies were carried out in a mouse ear edema model created by topical application of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on the right ear of ICR mice. Results: Radiolabeling yields increased with increasing amounts of 2-IT. When the 2-IT/protein ratio reached 1000, the radiolabeling yield was greater than 90% without significant colloid production. TPA-treated ears showed high radioligand uptake, which was clearly detected by SPECT and autoradiographic imaging. The activities (%ID/g) in the inflamed and control ears at 3 h after injection were 2.76 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.69 +/- 0.12 for IF, 5.86 +/- 0.40 vs. 2.86 +/- 0.61 for TF, and 7.61 +/- 0.86 vs. 1.99 +/- 0.31 for TFI (P<0.05 vs. controls). TFI showed significantly higher uptake in the inflamed ears compared to TF and IF (P<0.05). Blocking study results indicated specificity of radioligand binding with decreased radioactive uptake in the inflamed ears. Western blotting and ELISA analysis further confirmed a high expression of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha in the inflamed ears. Conclusions: Tc-99m-labeled cytokine ligands are a promising approach for detecting and understanding the inflammatory process. TFI may be more useful than the single-domain ligands for noninvasive detection of inflammatory sites. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

[F-18] LBT-999 was first labelled with carbon-11; we will now describe its in vivo behaviour in comparison to that of [C-11]LBT-999. Methods/Results: Positron emission tomography (PET) experiments (baboons) confirmed the high affinity/specificity of [F-18]LBT-999 for DAT. The brain regional distribution was in accordance with that of DAT. Pre-treatment with LBT-999 (I mg/kg iv), but not with desipramine, a norepinephrine (NET) antagonist, reduced the striatum-to-cerebellum ratio by 96%, confirming the specificity for DAT vs. NET. The parent compound decreased rapidly and represented 24.3 +/- 5.0% of plasma radioactivity at 30 min pi. Whole-body scans showed an important bone uptake of free fluorine following metabolism of [F-18]LBT-999. In the cerebellum and striatum, distribution volumes increased by 30-40% between 80 and 230 min, suggesting the polluting role of a radiometabolite(s). [C-11}LBT-999 exhibited a 40% higher standardized uptake value in the striata. This difference is likely due to N-dealkylation followed by [F-18]fluoride release. 2 beta-Carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4'-tolyl) nortropane is then formed, while [C-11]2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4'-tolyl) nortropane is formed following injection of [C-11]LBT-999. This metabolite has high affinity for the DAT. In one specific PET experiment, intravenous injection of this metabolite induced a strong displacement of [F-18]LBT-999 in the striata, confirming that this metabolite readily crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and binds to DAT. Conclusions: [F-18]LBT-999 is N-dealkylated in vivo to yield (I) a nonradioactive metabolite that crosses the BBB and has a high affinity for the DAT and (2) a [F-18]fluoro-alkyl chain which is further defluorinated. The temporal changes in distribution volumes are consistent with the accumulation of a radiometabolite(s) in the brain. Therefore, the quantification of DAT density with [F-18]LBT-999 is rather difficult. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Effects on the detrusor were determined as regards the ability to inhibit carbachol-induce contractions and contractions induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS). Radioligand binding studies were performed to assess the ability to displace quinuclidinyl benzilate (H-3-QNB) from muscarinic receptors in the detrusor and parotid gland. Lu 25-109 produced a concentration-dependent rightward shift of the concentration-response curves for carbachol in both human and pig detrusor, the pK(b) values being 6.2 +/- 0.1 (n = 6) and 5.8 +/- 0.3 (n = 6). Corresponding values for oxybutynin were 7.9 +/- 0.1 (n = 7) and 7.8 +/- 0.1 (n = 6). Contractions induced by EFS in human detrusor were almost completely inhibited by 100 mumol/L Lu 25-109 (84 +/- 4%; n = 4). In contrast, EFS-induced contractions in pig detrusor were less sensitive to Lu 25-109, resulting in a final inhibition of 32 +/- 6% (n = 9) with the highest concentration used (100 mumol/L). This difference in effect between human and pig detrusor was not observed with oxybutynin. Radioligand binding experiments demonstrated a small difference in affinity for Lu 25-109 in the parotid gland compared with the bladder, the pK(i) values being 6.2 +/- 0.1 versus 6.5 +/- 0.1 (n = 4). Corresponding values for oxybutynin were 8.5 +/- 0.1 versus 8.2 +/- 0.1 (n = 4). The results show that Lu 25-109 competitively and effectively antagonizes carbachol-induced contractions and contractions induced by EFS in human detrusor muscle. Even if Lu 25-109 were less potent than oxybutynin, it has an effect profile that makes it of interest to test its ability to counteract bladder overactivity in humans. Neurourol.

In the presented research, we developed two novel structural modifications of aprepitant to create aprepitant conjugates with different radionuclide chelators. All of them were radiolabeled with(68)Ga and(177)Lu radionuclides and evaluated in terms of their lipophilicity and stability in human serum. Furthermore, fully stable conjugates were examined in molecular modelling with a human neurokinin 1 receptor structure and in a competitive radioligand binding assay using rat brain homogenates in comparison to the aprepitant molecule. This initial research is in the conceptual stage to give potential theranostic-like radiopharmaceutical pairs for the imaging and therapy of neurokinin 1 receptor-overexpressing cancers.

Affinity-based predictions concerning competitive antagonism on the target will only be accurate if equilibrium binding of both ligands is allowed. Unless equilibrium for ligand binding is obtained really quickly, it is unlikely that equilibrium is established in vivo. Instead, concentrations of (endogenous) ligands rapidly fluctuate over time. Hence, the velocity in which binding equilibrium is reached and the duration of target occupancy by the ligand (also known as residence time) are thought to be more important predictors of drug in vivo efficacy. This chapter provides the theoretical background on ligand-binding kinetics and several experimental approaches to determine the target residence time of antihistamines on histamine receptors.

In some cases, a challenge drug such as amphetamine is introduced to increase the amount of dopamine released into the synaptic cleft. Although intravenous amphetamine is often utilized, oral amphetamine has been shown to be just as effective in increasing endogenous dopamine levels. Based on our own use of oral amphetamine as a challenge drug, we have retroactively reviewed our study charts to determine the cardiovascular safety of 0.5 mg kg(-1) oral d-amphetamine. Of 172 amphetamine administrations in 144 individuals, only 2.8% of subjects experienced any transient adverse effects. In addition, we found no clinically relevant differences in increases of vital signs between healthy controls and patients. We therefore reaffirm the safety of 0.5 mg kg(-1) oral amphetamine in subjects previously screened for cardiovascular risk factors.	[Weidner, Lora D.; Paris, Antonio; Frankle, W.

In this work, we developed a general photocoupling chemistry to enable simple conjugation of MIP nanoparticles with magnetic nanoparticles. We first synthesized MIP nanoparticles particles using propranolol as a model template and perfluorophenyl zide-modified silica-coated ol nano-particles. Using a simple photoactica- ti model followed ac il e purification with a magnet, we obtained magnetic composite particles that showed selective up take of propranolol. We characterized the nanoparticles and composite materials using FT-IR, TEM, fluorescence spectroscopy, and radioligand binding analysis. Through the high molecular selectivity of the magnetic composite, we demonstrated the nondestructive feature and the high efficiency of the photocoupling chemistry. The versatile photoconjugation method developed in this work should also be very useful for combining organic MIPs with other inorganic nanoparticles to enable new chemical sensors and high efficiency photocatalysts.

Several radioligands have been designed with improved properties. Our group recently developed an F-18-labeled TSPO ligand, [F-18]-FEPPA, and confirmed its reliability with a 2-tissue compartment model. Here, we extended, in a group of healthy subjects, its suitability for use in voxel-based analysis with the newly proposed graphical analysis approach, Relative-Equilibrium-Gjedde-Patlak (REGP) plot. The REGP plot successfully replicated the total distribution volumes estimated by the 2-tissue compartment model. We also showed its proof-of-concept in a patient with possible meningioma showing increased [F-18]-FEPPA total distribution volume.

The alkaloid conessine and analogues as potent histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							H-3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; LIGANDS; PHOSPHOLIPIDOSIS; CYTOCHROME-P450; PHARMACOLOGY; INHIBITION; INDUCTION; RELEASE; NEURONS	The naturally occurring alkaloid, conessine (6), was discovered to bind to histamine H-3 receptors in a radioligand-based high-throughput screen. Conessine displayed high affinity at both rat and human H-3 receptors (pK(i) = 7.61 and 8.27) and generally high selectivity against other sites, including histamine receptors H-1, H-2, and H-4. Conessine was found to efficiently penetrate the CNS and reach very high brain concentrations. Although the very slow CNS clearance and strong binding to adrenergic receptors discouraged focus on conessine itself for further development, its potency and novel steroid-based skeleton motivated further chemical investigation. Modification based on introducing diversity at the 3-nitrogen position generated a new series of H-3 antagonists with higher in vitro potency, improved target selectivity, and more favorable drug-like properties. One optimized analogue (13c) was examined in detail and was found to be efficacious in animal behavioral model of cognition.

These quaternary compounds are powerful blockers, and the most active ones have 10 times more affinity for the channels than dequalinium. The unsubstituted compounds possess a weaker affinity than the analogues having a 6,7-dimethoxy- or a 6,7,8-trimethoxy substitution. The length of the linker has no influence in the alkane derivatives. In relation to the xylene derivatives, the affinities are higher for the ortho and meta isomers. These results are well corroborated by a molecular modeling study. Finally, the most effective compounds have been tested in electrophysiological experiments on midbrain dopaminergic neurons and demonstrate the blocking potential of the apamin-sensitive after-hyperpolarization.

Furthermore, the maximal induction of guanosine 5 '-(gamma -thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTP gammaS) binding to G proteins and the inhibition of NECA-stimulated binding, in membranes of CHO cells which express the human A(3) receptor, were used to determine the intrinsic activity of these nucleosides at the A(3) adenosine receptor. The results showed that these new adenosine derivatives are very selective ligands for the A(3) receptor subtype and behave as adenosine antagonists, since they do not stimulate basal [S-35]GTP gammaS binding, but inhibit NECA-stimulated binding. This is the first report that adenosine derivatives, with unmodified ribose moiety, are adenosine receptor antagonists. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We herein present the synthesis of a potential gamma-turn mimetic scaffold, and its incorporation in the 3-5 position of angiotensin II. Two analogues of angiotensin TI (Ang II) incorporating this 1,3,5-trisubstituted benzene gamma-turn scaffold were synthesized. Evaluation of the compounds in a radioligand binding assay showed that they lacked affinity to the AT(1) receptor. To rationalize these results a geometrical and electrostatical comparison with Ang II analogues encompassing a bicyclic scaffold that delivered inactive pseudo peptides and an azepine scaffold producing highly active ligands was made. This analysis did not provide a clear rationale for the inactivity of the benzene gamma-turn scaffolds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, exploration of its therapeutic applications has been hampered by the lack of small molecule ligands and the cross-activation of RXFP1 in the brain and RXFP4 in the periphery. Herein, we report the first structure & minus;activity relationship studies of a series of novel nonpeptide amidinohy-drazone-based agonists, which were characterized by RXFP3 functional and radioligand binding assays. Several potent and efficacious RXFP3agonists (e.g.,10d) were identified with EC50values < 10 nM.

This review article summarizes the current regulatory framework for clinical trials with radiopharmaceuticals in the European Union, provides a general overview of the documentation required, and addresses quality, safety, and clinical aspects to be considered. By using a recent successful example of translating a theranostic peptide radioligand, namely In-111-CP04, which targets receptors expressed in medullary thyroid carcinoma, the pathway from the preclinical development over establishing the required pharmaceutical documentation to designing and submitting a clinical trial is reviewed. Details regarding preclinical data, generation of the documentation, and final successful application are described. This article should provide an insight in an ever more complex process to bring innovations in the field of radiopharmaceuticals into patients.

Development of Polar Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> Receptor Agonists for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Synergism with A<sub>2B</sub> Antagonists	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						A(2A) receptor agonist; inflammatory bowel disease; anti-inflammatory drug; nonabsorbable A(2A) receptor agonist; A(2B) receptor antagonist	PLATELET-AGGREGATION INHIBITORS; RADIOLIGAND; AFFINITY; LIGANDS	Adenosine A(2A) receptor agonists for the local treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBS) were designed and synthesized. Polar groups were introduced to prevent peroral absorption and subsequent systemic, e.g., hypotensive, side effects. 4-(2-{6-Amino-9-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran-2-yl]-9H-purin-2-ylthio}ethyl)-benzenesulfonic acid (7, PSB-0777) was selected for further evaluation in rat ileum/jejunum preparations in ex vivo experiments. Compound 7 significantly improved impaired acetylcholine-induced contractions induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid and showed synergism with an A(2B)-selective antagonist. Thus, nonabsorbable, locally active A(2A) agonists, as a monotherapy or in combination with an A(2B) antagonist, may be an efficient novel treatment for IBS, preventing the severe systemic side effects of known A(2A) agonists.

Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to identify the factors with the greatest influence on binding. While the dielectric constant (D) made a significant contribution to describing the observed binding, the influence of polarity as reflected in the Snyder polarity index (SPI) was also demonstrated to make a significant contribution. The use of solvents containing hydroxyl functionality in particular was observed to exert unique effects on recognition. The variation in solvent influence on binding at constant D motivates more complex analyses when studying MIP-ligand recognition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ratiometric calcium imaging of Periplaneta americana neuronal cell cultures upon piperovatine application revealed that this compound induced dramatic increases in intracellular calcium concentration. Calcium flux was not affected by co-application of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, atropine, indicating that the parasympathornimetic system was not involved in piperovatine's sialogogic actions. Calcium flux was, however, totally eliminated by co-application of the voltage-gated sodium channel blocker, tetrodotoxin (TTX). This, in conjunction with the repetitive calcium spikes observed in the assay and previous radioligand binding studies on the chemical class, strongly suggest that activation of voltage-gated sodium channels characterizes piperovatine's mode of action (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Recent preclinical studies suggested similar to 30x higher kidney absorbed dose for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T compared to [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, which may lead to an increased risk of kidney toxicity. We performed two single-centre, prospective dosimetry studies with either [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 or [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T, using an identical dosimetry protocol. We evaluated the absorbed doses of both Lu-177-labelled radioligands in human kidneys. Methods3D SPECT/computed tomography (CT) imaging of the kidneys was performed after PSMA-RLT in cancer patients with PSMA-positive disease and an adequate glomerular filtration rate (>= 50 mL/min). Ten metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer patients (mHSPC) were treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and 10 advanced salivary gland cancer (SGC) patients were treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T. SPECT/CT imaging was performed at five timepoints (1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h, and 168 h post-injection). In mHSPC patients, SPECT/CT imaging was performed after cycles 1 and 2 (cumulative activity: 9 GBq) and in SGC patients only after cycle 1 (activity: 7.4 GBq). Kidney absorbed dose was calculated using organ-based dosimetry. ResultsThe median kidney absorbed dose was 0.49 Gy/GBq (range: 0.34-0.66) and 0.73 Gy/GBq (range: 0.42-1.31) for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T, respectively (independent samples t test; P = 0.010). ConclusionThis study shows that the kidney absorbed dose for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T differs, with a similar to 1.5x higher median kidney absorbed dose for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T. This difference in the clinical setting is considerably smaller than observed in preclinical studies and may not hamper treatments with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-I&T.	[Uijen, Maike J. M.; van Herpen, Carla M.

The used sampling scheme affects the TIACs and therefore the calculated absorbed doses. The aim of this work was to develop a general and flexible method, which analyses numerous clinically applicable sampling schedules using true time-activity curves (TACs) of virtual patients. Method: Nine virtual patients with true TACs of the tumours were created using a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and individual biokinetic data of five patients with neuroendocrine tumours and four with meningioma. In-111-DOTATATE was used for pre-therapeutic dosimetry. In total, 15,120 sampling schemes, each consisting of 4 time points, were investigated. Gaussian noise of different levels was added to the corresponding true time-activity points. A bi-exponential function was used to fit the simulated time-activity data. For each investigated sampling schedule, 1000 replications were performed. Patient-specific and population-specific optimal sampling schedules were determined using the relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE). Furthermore, the fractions of TIACs (a) over tilde deviating >5% (f(Delta(a) over tilde >5%)) and >10% (f(Delta(a) over tilde >10%)) from the true TIAC (a) over tilde (true) were used for additional evaluations e.g. to investigate the effect of varying single time points. Results: Almost all patient-specific and all population-specific optimal sampling schedules have t(4) >= 96 h for all noise levels. Changing the latest time point from the population-specific optimal time to e.g. 48 h leads to a median increase of f(Delta(a) over tilde >10%) from 0.1% to 88% for the lowest investigated noise level. Using the determined population-specific optimal schedules, results in more accurate and precise results than established schedules from the literature. Conclusion: A method of determining the optimal sampling schedule for dosimetry, which considers clinical working hours and measurement uncertainties, has been developed and applied. The simulation study shows that optimised sampling schedules result in high accuracy and precision of the determined TIACs.

Here, we investigate the test-retest variability of cerebral [C-11] Cimbi-36 PET and compare [C-11] Cimbi-36 and the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist [F-18] altanserin. Methods: Sixteen healthy volunteers (mean age 23.9 +/- 6.4 years, 6 males) were scanned twice with a high resolution research tomography PET scanner. All subjects were scanned after a bolus of [C-11] Cimbi-36; eight were scanned twice to determine test-retest variability in [C-11] Cimbi-36 binding measures, and another eight were scanned after a bolus plus constant infusion with [F-18] altanserin. Regional differences in the brain distribution of [C-11] Cimbi-36 and [F-18] altanserin were assessed with a correlation of regional binding measures and with voxel-based analysis. Results: Test-retest variability of [C-11] Cimbi-36 non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) was consistently <5% in high-binding regions and lower for reference tissuemodels as compared to a 2-tissue compartmentmodel. We found a highly significant correlation between regional BP(ND)s measuredwith [C-11] Cimbi-36 and [F-18] altanserin (mean Pearson's r: 0.95 +/- 0.04) suggesting similar cortical binding of the radioligands. Relatively higher binding with [C-11] Cimbi-36 as compared to [F-18] altanserin was found in the choroid plexus and hippocampus in the human brain. Conclusions: Excellent test-retest reproducibility highlights the potential of [C-11] Cimbi-36 for PET imaging of 5-HT2A receptor agonist binding in vivo. Our data suggest that Cimbi-36 and altanserin both bind to 5-HT2A receptors, but in regions with high 5-HT2C receptor density, choroid plexus and hippocampus, the [C-11] Cimbi-36 binding likely represents binding to both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors.

Imaging of VEGF receptor expression in malignant tumors would provide important information, which can influence patient management. The aim of this study was the development of an easy-to-label positron-emitting tracer for imaging VEGF receptors. The tracer is based on engineered single-chain VEGF (scVEGF), expressed with cysteine-containing fusion tag (Cys-tag) for site-specific conjugation of PEGylated bifunctional chelating agents, HBED-CC or NOTA, suitable for labeling with Ga-68 at ambient temperature. Methods: scVEGF-PEG-HBED-CC was synthesized by activating a single carboxyl group of the [Fe(HBED-CC)](-) complex with N-hydroxysuccinimide. Reaction of the activated complex with NH2-PEG-maleimide was followed by site-specific conjugation of PEGylated chelator to a thiol group in Cys-tag of scVEGF. The scVEGF-PEG-NOTA conjugate was synthesized using NHS-PEG-maleimide and p-NH2-Bn-NOTA. Ga-68 complexation was performed in HEPES buffer (pH 4.2) at room temperature. The functional activity after labeling was tested by radioligand cell binding assays. Biodistribution and PET studies in tumor-bearing mice were performed after 1, 2, 3 and 4 11 postinjection. Results: The radiolabeling of'scVEGF-PEG-HBED-CC proved more efficient than scVEGF-PEG-NOTA allowing to stop the reaction after 4 min (>97% radiochemical yield). Radioligand cell binding assays performed on HEK-293 cells overexpressing VEGFR-2 revealed no change in the binding properties of Ga-68-radiolabeled scVEGF relative to other scVEGF-based tracers. Both tracers showed comparable results in biodistribution, such as tumor accumulation and low liver uptake. The tracers were stable in 50% human serum for at least 72 h. Conclusions: The conjugates scVEGF-PEG-HBED-CC and scVEGF-PEG-NOTA revealed comparable in vivo characteristics and allowed easy-to-perform labeling with high stability for fast [Ga-68]PET imaging of VEGF receptors in angiogenic vasculature.

Brain and whole-body imaging in nonhuman primates with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MeS-IMPY, a candidate radioligand for β-amyloid plaques	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						positron emission tomography; beta-amyloid plaques; [C-11]MeS-IMPY; dosimetry; kinetic analysis	PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PET; BINDING; BIODISTRIBUTION; DOSIMETRY; HUMANS; TRACER; MODEL	[C-11]MeS-IMPY ([S-methyl-C-11]NN-dimethyl-4-(6-(methylthio)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-2-yl)aniline) is a potential radioligand for imaging beta-amyloid plaques with positron emission tomography (PET). The aims of this study were to evaluate [C-11]MeS-IMPY uptake in nonhuman primate brain and to estimate radiation exposure from serial whole-body images. Eight PET studies were performed in rhesus monkeys to measure the brain uptake and washout of [C-11]MeS-IMPY Time-activity data were analyzed with one-tissue and two-tissue compartmental models using radiometabolite-corrected plasma input function. In addition, two whole-body PET scans were acquired for 120 min to determine the biodistribution of C]MeS-IMPY Tomographic PET images were compressed into a single planar image to identify organs with the highest radiation exposures. Estimates of the absorbed dose of radiation were calculated using OLINDA 1.0. Injection of [C-11]MeS-IMPY caused little change in pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and temperature. [C-11]MeS-IMPY showed high standardized brain uptake values of similar to 500% and 600% between 2 and 3 min in cortical regions and the cerebellum, respectively. The brain uptake of [C-11]MeS-IMPY was widespread and quite uniform across all cortical regions. Activity rapidly washed out of the brain, with 20% of peak activity remaining at 40 min. Thus, all brain regions showed minimal retention of radioactivity, consistent with these healthy young animals having negligible amyloid plaques. Regional brain activity fitted well into a one-tissue compartment model. The average volume of distribution in all brain regions was 7.66 +/- 2.14 ml/cm(3) (n=4). The organs with the highest radiation exposure (mu Sv/MBq) were the gallbladder wall (33.4), urinary bladder (17) and lungs (12.9), with a resulting effective dose of 4.9 mu Sv/MBq (18 mrem/mCi). The high brain uptake, rapid washout and quantifiable volume of distribution in nonhuman primate brain further support the evaluation of [C-11]MeS-IMPY. Calculated dosimetry results are comparable with those for other C-labeled brain imaging radioligands. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Characterization of the potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic profile for six adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonists	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						human-cloned adenosine receptors; PC12 cells; rat striaturn; radioligand binding assay; cAMP assay; [H-3]MSX-2 center dot [H-3]CGS21680; A(2A)-antagonist	RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; BINDING-SITES; CGS 21680; RADIOLIGAND; SCH-58261; BLOCKADE; LIGANDS; CORTEX; BRAIN; MICE	Antagonists of adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)-antagonists) with different chemical structures have been developed by several pharmaceutical companies for the potential treatment of Parkinson's disease. Pharmacological characterization of these antagonists was incomplete, and different assay conditions were used in different labs. Therefore, we characterized the potencies, selectivities, and pharmacokinetic profiles of six prototypical A(2A)-antagonists. Displacements of [H-3]MSX-2 and of [H-3] CGS21680 binding to the human cloned and rat A(2A) receptors were performed. The rank order of potency of antagonists to displace [H-3]MSX-2 binding to the human A(2A) was SCH58261 >= Biogen-34 >= Ver-6623 >= MSX-2 >= KW6002>>DMPX. For the rat striatal A(2A), the order of potency was Biogen-34 >= SCH58261 >= Ver-6623 >= MSX-2 >= KW-6002>>DMPX. SCH58261 was the most potent antagonist of the human A(2A) with a K-i value of 4 nM, whereas Biogen-34 was the most potent antagonist of the rat A(2A) with a K-i value of 1.2 nM. Similar results were obtained from cAMP assays. Selectivities of A(2A)-antagonists were determined using radioligands [H-3]DPCPX, [H-3] ZM241385, and [I-125]-AB-MECA for A(1), A(2B), and A(3) receptors, respectively. KW-6002 and Biogen-34 exhibited the highest selectivity for A(2A) vs A, (human and rat), respectively. The pharmacokinetic profiles of antagonists were evaluated in vivo in rats. DMPX and KW-6002 had the greatest oral bioavailability. In contrast, SCH58261, MSX-2, and Ver-6623 had low or poor oral bioavailability. In summary, SCH58261, Biogen-34, MSX-2, and Ver-6623 had high affinities for both human and rat A(2A) receptors, with reasonable selectivity for A(2A) over A(1) and A(2B) receptors. They are suitable as A(2A)-antagonists for in vitro pharmacological studies. Among the six A(2A)-antagonists, KW-6002 is the best for use in in vivo animal studies, particularly for a CNS target, based on its bioavailability, half life, and brain penetration.

Stimulants increase extracellular dopamine levels in the brain, including the reward and addiction pathways, through interacting with dopamine transporter (DAT). This work aimed to assess the molecular and atomistic mechanisms of stimulant NPS actions at DAT, which translate into biological outcomes such as dopamine release in the brain's reward pathway. We applied combinedin vitro,in vivo, andin silicomethods and selected 2-diphenylmethylpiperidine (2-DPMP) as an example of stimulant NPS for this study. We measuredin vitrobinding of 2-DPMP to rat striatum and accumbens DAT by means of quantitative autoradiography with a selective DAT-radioligand [I-125]RTI-121. We evaluated the effects of intravenously administered 2-DPMP on extracellular dopamine in the accumbens-shell and striatum usingin vivomicrodialysis in freely moving rats. We used dynamic modeling to investigate the interactions of 2-DPMP within DAT, in comparison with cocaine and amphetamine. 2-DPMP potently displaced the radioligand in the accumbens and striatum showing dose-dependence from 0.3 to 30 mu M. IC(50)values were: 5.65 x 10(-7)M for accumbens shell and 6.21 x 10(-7)M for dorsal striatum. Dose-dependent responses were also observed in accumbens-shell and striatumin vivo, with significant increases in extracellular dopamine levels. Molecular dynamics simulations identified contrasting conformational changes of DAT for inhibitors (cocaine) and releasers (amphetamine). 2-DPMP led to molecular rearrangements toward an outward-facing DAT conformation that suggested a cocaine-type effect. The present combination of molecular modeling with experimental neurobiological procedures allows for extensive characterization of the mechanisms of drug actions at DAT as the main molecular target of stimulants, and provides an insight into the role of dopamine in the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms of brain responses to stimulant NPS that have addictive potential. Such knowledge reveals the risk of addiction related to NPS use. The research presented here can be adapted for other psychostimulants that act at their membrane protein targets.

Recently, R-PhP was shown to bind to the dopamine transporter (DAT). Since growing evidence suggests that dysfunction of the dopaminergic system is associated with persistent neuroinflammation, the aim of this study was to determine whether R-PhP, an inhibitor of DAT, has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects in male mice. The pharmacokinetic profiles of R-PhP in mouse plasma and its bioavailability in brain tissue were assessed. To study possible molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-inflammatory activity of R-PhP, target profiling was performed using radioligand binding and enzymatic activity assays. To clarify the neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of R-PhP, we used a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxaemia model characterized by reduced body temperature and overexpression of inflammatory genes in the brain. In addition, the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of R-PhP were tested using carrageenan-induced paw oedema and formalin-induced paw-licking tests. R-PhP (50 mg/kg) reached the brain tissue 15 min after intraperitoneal (ip) and peroral (po) injections. The maximal concentration of R-PhP in the brain tissues was 28 mu g/g and 18 mu g/g tissue after ip and po administration, respectively. In radioligand binding assays, DAT was the only significant molecular target found for R-PhP. A single ip injection of R-PhP significantly attenuated the LPS-induced body temperature reduction and the overexpression of inflammatory genes, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Seven-day po pretreatment with R-PhP dose-dependently reduced paw oedema and the antinociceptive response, as shown by the carrageenan-induced paw oedema test. In addition, R-PhP decreased the nociceptive response during the inflammatory phase in the formalin-induced paw-licking test. Our study showed that R-PhP possesses neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, demonstrating the potential of DAT inhibitors as effective therapeutics.

The resulting probes retain very high affinity and efficacy for both the wildtype and SNAP-tagged apelin receptor (ApelinR). They give a time-resolved FRET (TR-FRET) signal with rare-earth lanthanides used as donor fluorophores grafted onto the SNAP-tagged receptor. This specific signal allowed the validation of a binding assay with a high signal-to-noise ratio. In such an assay, the most potent sub-nanomolar fluorescent probe was found to be competitively displaced by the endogenous apelin peptides with binding constants similar to those obtained in a classical radioligand assay. We have thus validated the first TR-FRET cell-based binding assay for ApelinR with potential high-throughput screening applications.

This GPCR was found to be involved in a multitude of allergic and inflammatory diseases. Antagonizing H(4)Rs results in profound anti-inflammatory effects in various animal disease models, and a first phase 2a clinical trial in patients suffering from atopic dermatitis has already been conducted. In order to accelerate and expand current drug discovery at H4R, in-depth understanding of its molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways are key. Complexity of H4R signaling pathways was highlighted by the discovery of so-called biased ligands, which can initiate differential efficacies in various GPCR responses. This chapter will provide an overview of commonly applied methods used to elucidate the molecular pharmacological aspects of the H4R from receptor-ligand-binding interactions to downstream gene transcription.

All rhenium complexes (5a-d) showed affinity for A beta((1-42)) aggregates (K-i = 13.6-120.9 nM), and selectively stained the A beta plaques on brain sections of transgenic mice. Biodistribution in normal mice revealed that [Tc-99m]5a-d exhibited moderate initial uptake (0.31%-0.49% ID/g at 2 min) and reasonable brain washout at 60 min post-injection. Although additional optimizations are still needed to facilitate it's penetration through BBB, the present results indicate that [Tc-99m]5a may be a potential SPECT probe for imaging A beta plaques in Alzheimer's brains.

Recently, receptorome profiles have led to mechanistic insights into the actions -both intentional and adverse-of several drugs. In the present review, I discuss in detail, how receptorome screening increased our understanding of three drugs (salvinorin A, amisulpride and fenfluramine) and a class of medications (atypical antipsychotics). The cases presented suggest that receptorome screening of current medications, as well as investigational drugs and future compounds destined for use in humans, might enable us to predict salutary effects, as well as side effects, at the preclinical stage, which would have important economic and public health implications.

EC140 was produced by coupling a peptidic analogue of the vitamin folic acid to DAVLBH via an acylhydrazone bond. This water-soluble conjugate was found to retain high affinity for FR-positive cells, and it produced specific, dose-responsive activity in vitro. Initial in vivo tests confirmed EC140's activity in both syngeneic and xenograft models. Hence, enduring complete responses were observed in animals bearing established, subcutaneous tumors prior to therapy using regimens that produced minor toxicity. In contrast, treatment with the unconjugated DAVLBH drug produced nominal efficacy when dosed at its MTD. Overall, EC140's performance in vitro and in vivo warrants further preclinical study before this novel targeted chemotherapeutic is considered for clinical investigation.

We report here on the design, synthesis, and characterization of two novel pirenzepine derivatives that were coupled to patent blue VF and pinacyanol dyes. These nonfluorescent compounds, when added to cells stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)fused muscarinic M1 receptors, promote EGFP fluorescence extinction in a time-, concentration-, and atropine-dependent manner. They display nanomolar affinity for the muscarinic receptor, determined using either FRET or classical radioligand binding conditions. We provide evidence that these compounds behave as potent acceptors of energy from excited EGFP with quenching efficiencies comparable to those of analogous fluorescent bodipy or rhodamine red pirenzepine derivatives. The advantages they offer over fluorescent ligands are illustrated and discussed in terms of reliability, sensitivity, and wider applicability of FRET-based receptor binding assays.

Some of them exhibit extremely potent antagonism of the PGD(2) receptor in radioligand binding and cAMP formation assays with IC50 values below 50 nM and much less antagonism of TXA(2) and PGI(2) receptors. These potent PGD(2) receptor antagonists, when given orally, dramatically suppress various allergic inflammatory responses such as increased vascular permeability in allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma models. The excellent pharmacological profiles of PGD(2) receptor antagonists, originally synthesized in our laboratories, are of potentially great clinical significance. This study also provides experimental evidence suggesting that PGD(2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases.

It was found that in contrast to the previously described series of tricyclic heterocycles,l this bicyclic series has very specific requirements for the heterocyclic attachments. The most important structural features contributing to the alpha (1A)/alpha (1B) selectivity of these compounds were identified. In vitro functional assays for the al adrenoceptor subtypes were used to further characterize the most selective compounds, and in vivo models of vascular vs prostatic tone were used to assess uroselectivity. Compound 48 showed the highest degree of selectivity in the radioligand binding assays (56-fold), in the in vitro functional tests (80-fold), and for in vivo prostate selectivity (960-fold).

Radioligand binding assays were performed to measure the affinity of the compounds to the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. The affinity of all 2,4-diphenyl-substituted 3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ones to the mu- and delta-receptors was found to be low. In contrast, with exception of the nitro- and cyanophenyl-substituted compounds, most of the diazabicycles showed considerable affinity for the kappa-receptor. In particular, the m-fluoro-, p-methoxy-, and m-hydroxy-substituted compounds have an affinity in the submicromolar range. Due to solubility problems in aqueous media, salts of HZ2 were synthesized. The methiodide shows high kappa-affinity and may, thus, be a promising candidate for development of a peripheral kappa-agonist, e.g. for use in the case of rheumatoid arthritis.

Scatchard plots of I-125-MCH binding in human brain (thalamus) gave a dissociation constant of 0.2 +/- 0.06 nM and maximal binding of 5.8 +/- 0.3 fmol/mg protein (n = 3). These findings suggest that specific MCH binding sites that differ from the melanocortin receptors exist in human brain. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

To shed light on the molecular determinants, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Na+ translocation through the mu-OR (MOR), we used a multi-ensemble Markov model framework combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Na+ binding to MOR active or inactive crystal structures embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer. We identify an energetically favorable, continuous ion pathway through the MOR active conformation only, and provide, for the first time: i) estimates of the energy differences and required timescales of Na+ translocation in inactive and active MORs, ii) estimates of Na+-induced changes to agonist binding validated by radioligand measurements, and iii) testable hypotheses of molecular determinants and correlated motions involved in this translocation, which are likely to play a key role in MOR signaling.

Recently, a novel bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) method utilizing a NanoLuc-fused receptor was introduced to detect fluorescent ligand binding. Moreover, this NanoBRET method gives the opportunity to follow fluorescent ligand binding on intact cells in real time, and therefore, results might better reflect in vivo conditions as compared with the routinely used cell homogenates or purified membrane fractions. In this study, a real-time NanoBRET-based binding assay was established and validated to detect binding of unlabeled ligands to the histamine H-3 receptor (H3R) and histamine H-4 receptor on intact cells. Obtained residence times of clinically tested H3R antagonists were reflected by their duration of H3R antagonism in a functional receptor recovery assay.	[Mocking, Tamara A. M.; Verweij, Eleonore W.

Benzamide and furamide linked to thiazole was found to be crucial for high adenosine receptor affinity. The most potent compound indentified in this study was 5d with low nanomolar affinity for all four adenosine receptor subtypes. Compounds 5a and 5g showed moderate selectivity for A(2A) adenosine receptors. Molecular docking versus all four human adenosine receptors combined with membrane molecular dynamics studies were performed to rationalise the peculiar selectivity profile of 5d antagonist.

In binding experiments in vitro, 2-oxindole (2-OI) and 3-oxindole (3-OI) derivatives showed affinity for tau aggregates. The 3-OI derivative 14 showed the highest affinity of these derivatives. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, the OI derivatives displayed good uptake (2.4-2.5% ID/g at 2 min) and clearance from the brain with time (0.6-1.4% ID/g at 30 min). In fluorescence staining experiments using AD brain sections, 14 clearly stained NFTs. 3-OI may serve as a new molecular scaffold for developing novel NFT imaging agents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Radioligand binding assay suggested that compounds 1b and 1c could be recognized by the AT(1) receptor with an IC50 value of 1.6 +/- 0.09 nM and 2.64 +/- 0.7 nM, respectively. In vivo anti-hypertension experiments showed that compounds (1a, 1b, 1c, 1e) elicited a significant decrease in SBP and DBP of spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs). The antihypertensive effects maintained for 10 h, which indicated that these compounds had a favorable blood pressure-lowering effect. Acute toxicity testing suggested that the LD50 value of compound 1b was 2316.8 mg/kg which was lower than valsartan (LD50 = 307.50 mg/kg) but higher than losartan (LD50 = 2248 mg/kg). So they could be considered as novel anti-hypertension candidates and deserved for further investigation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We reasoned that it might be possible to prepare probe-carrying somatostatin analogues that would escape recycling, efficiently depositing probe molecules inside cells and ultimately increasing their intracellular concentration. We have incorporated cathepsin-B-cleavable linkers into (Tyr(3))-octreotate chelate conjugates and examined these constructs as to cellular uptake, externalization, subcellular localization, and cleavage in the rat pancreatic tumor cell line AR42J in culture. Comparison of the cleavable radioligands with a noncleavable control indicates that scission of the constituent cathepsin B substrate occurs at a rate faster than ligand externalization, depositing virtually all internalized cleaved radiochelates within lysosomal compartments.

In this system cyclohexylcarboxymagnesium chloride (1b) is more reactive than 4-fluorophenylcarboxymagnesium bromide (2b) and primary amines (e.g. aniline, aminopyridines) far more reactive than secondary amines (e.g. 2-(methylamino)pyridine). The scope of the reaction was widened considerably by the application of microwaves, which allowed reactions to be carried out at much higher temperature than the boiling point of the solvent (i.e. tetrahydrofuran, b.p. 67degreesC).

PET measurement of cyclooxygenase-2 using a novel radioligand: upregulation in primate neuroinflammation and first-in-human study	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Cyclooxygenase 2; Cyclooxygenase 1; Positron emission tomography; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharide; Rheumatoid arthritis	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; COX-2 EXPRESSION; TSPO; ACTIVATION; BRAIN; RADIOTRACERS; MACROPHAGE; LIGANDS; HUMANS	Background: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which is rapidly upregulated by inflammation, is a key enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of several inflammatory prostanoids. Successful positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand imaging of COX-2 in vivo could be a potentially powerful tool for assessing inflammatory response in the brain and periphery. To date, however, the development of PET radioligands for COX-2 has had limited success. Methods: The novel PET tracer [C-11]MC1 was used to examine COX-2 expression [1] in the brains of four rhesus macaques at baseline and after injection of the inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the right putamen, and [2] in the joints of two human participants with rheumatoid arthritis and two healthy individuals. In the primate study, two monkeys had one LPS injection, and two monkeys had a second injection 33 and 44 days, respectively, after the first LPS injection. As a comparator, COX-1 expression was measured using [C-11]PS13. Results: COX-2 binding, expressed as the ratio of specific to nondisplaceable uptake (BPND) of [C-11]MC1, increased on day 1 post-LPS injection; no such increase in COX-1 expression, measured using [C-11]PS13, was observed. The day after the second LPS injection, a brain lesion (similar to 0.5 cm in diameter) with high COX-2 density and high BPND (1.8) was observed. Postmortem brain analysis at the gene transcript or protein level confirmed in vivo PET results. An incidental finding in an unrelated monkey found a line of COX-2 positivity along an incision in skull muscle, demonstrating that [C-11]MC1 can localize inflammation peripheral to the brain. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, [C-11]MC1 successfully imaged upregulated COX-2 in the arthritic hand and shoulder and apparently in the brain. Uptake was blocked by celecoxib, a COX-2 preferential inhibitor. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate that [C-11]MC1 can image and quantify COX-2 upregulation in both monkey brain after LPS-induced neuroinflammation and in human peripheral tissue with inflammation.

Synthesis and evaluation of candidate PET radioligands for corticotropin-releasing factor type-1 receptors	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF); Autoradiography; Positron emission tomography (PET); [C-11]BMS-709460; [F-18]BMS-721313; [F-18]BMS-732098; Rhesus monkey	FACTOR BINDING-SITES; IN-VIVO; CRF1 RECEPTORS; ANTAGONIST; ANXIETY; BRAIN; MODEL; LOCALIZATION; PHARMACOLOGY; DEPRESSION	Introduction: A radioligand for measuring the density of corticotropin-releasing factor subtype-1 receptors (CRF1 receptors) in living animal and human brain with positron emission tomography (PET) would be a useful tool for neuropsychiatric investigations and the development of drugs intended to interact with this target. This study was aimed at discovery of such a radioligand from a group of CAF(1), receptor ligands based on a core 3-(phenylamino)-pyrazin-2(1H)-one scaffold. Methods: CRF1 receptor ligands were selected for development as possible PET radioligands based on their binding potency at CRF1 receptors (displacement of [I-128]CRF from rat cortical membranes), measured lipophilicity, autoradiographic binding profile in rat and rhesus monkey brain sections, rat biodistribution, and suitability for radiolabeling with carbon-11 or fluorine-18. Two identified candidates (BMS-721313 and BMS-732098) were labeled with fluorine-18. A third candidate (BMS-709460) was labeled with carbon-11 and all three radioligands were evaluated in PET experiments in rhesus monkey. CRF1 receptor density (B-rnax) was assessed in rhesus brain cortical and cerebellum membranes with the CRF1 receptor ligand, [H-3]BMS-728300. Results: The three ligands selected for development showed high binding affinity (IC50 values, 0.3-8 nM) at CRF1 receptors and moderate lipophilicity (LogD, 2.8-4.4). [H-3]BMS-728300 and the two F-18-labeled ligands showed region-specific binding in rat and rhesus monkey brain autoradiography, namely higher binding density in the frontal and limbic cortex, and cerebellum than in thalamus and brainstem. CRF1 receptor B-max, in rhesus brain was found to be 50-120 fmol/mg protein across cortical regions and cerebellum. PET experiments in rhesus monkey showed that the radioligands [F-18]BMS-721313, [F-18]BMS-732098 and [C-11]BMS-709460 gave acceptably high brain radioactivity uptake but no indication of the specific binding as seen in vitro. Conclusions: Candidate CRF1 receptor PET radioligands were identified but none proved to be effective for imaging monkey brain CRF1 receptors. Higher affinity radioligands are likely required for successful PET imaging of CRF1 receptors. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Molecules that may selectively interact with one of the receptors are favorable multifunctional chemical entities to treat or decelerate the evolution of different diseases. 3-Arylcoumarins have already been studied as neuroprotective agents by our group. Here, differently 8-substituted 3-arylcoumarins are complementarily studied as ligands of adenosine receptors, performing radioligand binding assays. Among the synthesized compounds, selective A(3) receptor antagonists were found. 3-(4-Bromophenyl)-8-hydroxycoumarin (compound 4) displayed the highest potency and selectivity as A(3) receptor antagonist (K-i = 258 nM). An analysis of its X-ray diffraction provided detailed information on its structure. Further evaluation of a selected series of compounds indicated that it is the nature and position of the substituents that determine their activity and selectivity. Theoretical modeling calculations corroborate and explain the experimental data, suggesting this novel scaffold can be involved in the generation of candidates as multitarget drugs.

[F-18]2-Fluoroethyl-4-bromobenzenesulfonate, also called [F-18]2-fluoroethyl brosylate ([F-18]F(CH2)(2)OBs), was used as an alternative radiolabeling agent to prepare [F-18]FEOHOMADAM, a fluoroethoxy derivative of HOMADAM, by O-fluoroethylating the phenolic precursor. Purified by reverse-phase HPLC, the no-carrier-added [F-18]F(CH2)(2)OBs was obtained in an average radiochemical yield (RCY) of 35%. The reaction of the purified and dried [F-18]F(CH2)(2)OBs with the phenolic precursor was performed by heating in DMF and successfully produced [F-18]FEOHOMADAM, after HPLC purification, in RCY of 21%.

Immunohistochemistry studies were performed to locate the somatostatin neurons, and radioligand binding to ascertain the presence of sst(1). The neuronal release of somatostatin was examined ex vivo in rat retinal explants in the presence of KCl (50 and 100 MM), and absence of Ca++ (EGTA; 10 mM). Somatostatin levels, quantified by radioimmunoassay, were increased in the presence of KCl (100 mM, 151%) and attenuated in the absence of Ca++ (31%). CH275 (sst(1) agonist) reduced the somatostatin levels in a concentration-dependent manner (10(-5)- 10(-7) M), and this effect was reversed by NVP-SRA 880 (sst(1) antagonist; 10(-5) M). MK678 (sst(2) agonist; 10(-5) M) had no effect. These data suggest an autoreceptor role for sst(1) in retina. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The derivatives of 4-aryl-hexahydro- (1-5) and (R,R)(S,S)4-aryl-octahydropyrido[1,2c]pyrimidin-1,3-dion (17-19) served as starting compounds for further synteses. The N-alkylation of the imide moiety in compounds 1-5 and 17-19 by 1,4-dibromobutane gave the respective monbromobutyl derivatives 6-10 and 20-22. The final derivatives 11-16 and 23-27 have been produced by condensation of the obtained bromoderivatives with selected 1-aryl and 1-heteroarylpiperazines. Compounds 11-16 and 23-27 were tested for their affinity towards 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and alpha(1) receptors, using a radioligand binding assay.

Procedures We performed in vivo blocking as well as displacement of [C-11]ITDM during positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using the specific mGluR1 antagonist YM-202074. Additionally, we assessed in vitro blocking of [H-3]ITDM at two different doses of YM-202074. As an alternative to reference region models, we validated the use of a noninvasive image-derived input function (IDIF) compared to an arterial input function measured with an invasive arteriovenous (AV) shunt using a population-based curve for radiometabolite correction and characterized the pharmacokinetic modelling of [C-11]ITDM in the mouse brain. Finally, we also assessed semi-quantitative approaches. Results In vivo blocking with YM-202074 resulted in a decreased [C-11]ITDM binding, ranging from - 35.8 +/- 8.0 % in pons to - 65.8 +/- 3.0 % in thalamus. Displacement was also markedly observed in all tested regions. In addition, in vitro [H-3]ITDM binding could be blocked in a dose-dependent manner. The volume of distribution (V-T) based on the noninvasive IDIF (V-T (IDIF)) showed excellent agreement with the V-T values based on the metabolite-corrected plasma input function regardless of the metabolite correction (r(2) > 0.943, p < 0.0001). Two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) was found to be the preferred model and showed optimal agreement with Logan plot (r(2) > 0.960, p < 0.0001). A minimum scan duration of 80 min was required for proper parameter estimation. SUV was not reliable (r(2) = 0.379, p = 0.0011), unlike the SUV ratio to the SUV of the input function, which showed to be a valid approach. Conclusions No suitable reference region could be identified for [C-11]ITDM as strongly supported by in vivo and in vitro evidence of specific binding in all brain regions. However, by applying appropriate kinetic models, [C-11]ITDM PET imaging represents a promising tool to visualize mGluR1 in the mouse brain.

Receptor Autoradiography Protocol for the Localized Visualization of Angiotensin II Receptors	JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS			English	Article						Neuroscience; Issue 112; Receptor; Autoradiography; Cryostat; Brain Sectioning; X-ray; Film; Developing; AT(1)R Binding; Angiotensin II	COMMERCIAL ANTIBODIES LEADS; AT(2) RECEPTORS; TYPE-2 RECEPTOR; BINDING-SITES; BRAIN; SPECIFICITY; MISIDENTIFICATION; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION	This protocol describes receptor binding patterns for Angiotensin II (Ang II) in the rat brain using a radioligand specific for Ang II receptors to perform receptor autoradiographic mapping. Tissue specimens are harvested and stored at -80 degrees C. A cryostat is used to coronally section the tissue (brain) and thaw-mount the sections onto charged slides. The slide-mounted tissue sections are incubated in I-125-SI-Ang II to radiolabel Ang II receptors. Adjacent slides are separated into two sets: 'non-specific binding' (NSP) in the presence of a receptor saturating concentration of non-radiolabeled Ang II, or an AT(1) Ang II receptor subtype (AT(1)R) selective Ang II receptor antagonist, and 'total binding' with no AT(1)R antagonist. A saturating concentration of AT(2) Ang II receptor subtype (AT(2)R) antagonist (PD123319, 10 mu M) is also present in the incubation buffer to limit I-125-SI-Ang II binding to the AT(1)R subtype. During a 30 min pre-incubation at similar to 22 degrees C, NSP slides are exposed to 10 mu M PD123319 and losartan, while 'total binding' slides are exposed to 10 mu M PD123319. Slides are then incubated with I-125-SI-Ang II in the presence of PD123319 for 'total binding', and PD123319 and losartan for NSP in assay buffer, followed by several ' washes' in buffer, and water to remove salt and non-specifically bound radioligand. The slides are dried using blow-dryers, then exposed to autoradiography film using a specialized film and cassette. The film is developed and the images are scanned into a computer for visual and quantitative densitometry using a proprietary imaging system and a spreadsheet. An additional set of slides are thionin-stained for histological comparisons. The advantage of using receptor autoradiography is the ability to visualize Ang II receptors in situ, within a section of a tissue specimen, and anatomically identify the region of the tissue by comparing it to an adjacent histological reference section.

Here, we report reproducibility and reliability measures of binding parameter estimates for [C-11]NOP-1A binding in the brain of healthy humans. After intravenous injection of [C-11]NOP-1A, PET scans were conducted twice on eleven healthy volunteers on the same (10/11 subjects) or different (1/11 subjects) days. Subjects underwent serial sampling of radial arterial blood to measure parent radioligand concentrations. Distribution volume (V-T; a measure of receptor density) was determined by compartmental (one- and two-tissue) modeling in large regions and by simpler regression methods (graphical Logan and bilinear MA1) in both large regions and voxel data. Retest variability and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of V-T were determined as measures of reproducibility and reliability respectively. Regional [C-11]NOP-1A uptake in the brain was high, with a peak radioactivity concentration of 4-7 SUV (standardized uptake value) and a rank order of putamen > cingulate cortex > cerebellum. Brain time-activity curves fitted well in 10 of 11 subjects by unconstrained two-tissue compartmental model. The retest variability of VT was moderately good across brain regions except cerebellum, and was similar across different modeling methods, averaging 12% for large regions and 14% for voxel-based methods. The retest reliability of VT was also moderately good in most brain regions, except thalamus and cerebellum, and was similar across different modeling methods averaging 0.46 for large regions and 0.48 for voxels having gray matter probability >20%. The lowest retest variability and highest retest reliability of VT were achieved by compartmental modeling for large regions, and by the parametric Logan method for voxel-based methods. Moderately good reproducibility and reliability measures of VT for [C-11]NOP-1A make it a useful PET ligand for comparing NOP receptor binding between different subject groups or under different conditions in the same subject.

Thus, TSPO has been proposed as an excellent imaging biomarker, allowing, in this manner, to obtain an accurate diagnosis and to follow disease progression and therapy response. Accordingly, several radioligands have been developed to accomplish this purpose. In this work, we selected [F-18]FEPPA, as one of the clinical established tracers, and assessed its in vitro performance in colorectal cancer. Moreover, we setup an improved radiosynthesis method and assessed the in vitro binding affinity of the nonradioactive ligand toward the human TSPO. Our results show an excellent to moderate affinity, in the subnanomolar and nanomolar range, as well as the suitability of [F-18]FEPPA as an imaging agent for the TSPO in colorectal cancer.

Some of these probes displayed high affinities to A beta(1-42) aggregates, which ranged from 18.0 to 8.2 nM. The high and specific binding of the radiolabeled tracers was further confirmed by in vitro autoradiography on brain sections from AD patients and transgenic mouse. In biodistribution experiments, two F-18-labeled tracers [F-18]17a and [F-18]18 displayed high initial brain uptake ( 5.05 and 6.24% ID g(-1), respectively, at 2 min postinjection) and fast clearance from the brain with brain(2 min)/ brain(60 min) ratios of 6.08 and 8.00. These results demonstrate that the probes [F-18]17a and [F-18]18 with a dibenzylideneacetone structure containing pyridine rings have great strength in imaging A beta plaques in the brain.

Synthesis was performed by Fmoc-solid-phase strategy and Tc-99m labeled by SnCl2. Biodistribution and imaging properties of new radiopeptide were also studied in C6 tumor bearing rat. Radiolabeling was performed at high specific activities and it showed high binding-affinity for SSTR2. In biodistribution, radiopeptides have showed high and receptor-specific uptake in the SSTR2 positive organs, tumor with rapid renal excretion from non-target tissues. These results demonstrated that Tc-99m-HYNIC-AATE is a new specific radioligand for scintigraphy of somatostatin-receptor-positive tumors.

Novel mode of action of spinosad: Receptor binding studies demonstrating lack of interaction with known insecticidal target sites	PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Spinosad; Spinosyn A; Receptor binding; Insecticide; Periplaneta americana; Musca domestica	PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN; RADIOLIGAND; RESISTANCE	The ability of spinosyn A to either enhance or displace binding to selected insecticidally-relevant receptors was investigated using a number of radioligands including, [H-3]imidacloprid and [H-3]livermectin in tissues from the ventral nerve cord (VNC) membranes of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana and head membranes from the housefly, Musca domestica. In these insect neural tissues, spinosyn A does not appear to alter the binding of a number of radioligands suggesting that spinosyn A does not interact directly with a variety of known receptors, including nicotinic or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-based insecticidal target sites. However, available data are consistent with spinosyn A interacting with a site distinct from currently known insecticidal target sites, thus Supporting a novel insecticidal mechanism of action for the spinosyns.

Structurally related analogs were also prepared, where the naphthalene nucleus was replaced by the fluorescent carbazole moiety and chain length was varied. For all compounds the in vitro affinities toward a receptors and Delta(8)-Delta(7) sterol isomerase site were measured, and the fluorescent properties were determined. Compound 19 gave the best results both for a receptor affinities (sigma(1), K-i = 6.78 nM and sigma(2), Ki = 26.4 nM) and fluorescence features; thus, it was chosen for in vitro saturation binding analysis at a receptors. The good results obtained in such assay suggested that the fluorescent compound 19 could be used instead of a radioligand in "green" binding assays.

To assess the effects of TBI on the expression and functional integrity of dopamine transporters, we measured transporter protein levels and investigated synaptosomal dopamine uptake in the rat striatum. Two or four weeks after lateral controlled cortical impact or sham injury, Western blotting revealed a decrease in transporter protein in the ipsilateral striatum of injured rats relative to shams (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference in synaptosomal uptake (K-m, V-max) was found between injured and sham-injured animals. Our data suggest that striatal dopamine transporters are capable of normal function at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after injury. However, it is unclear whether neurons in the injured striatum can properly regulate the activity of dopamine transporters in vivo. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Dapsone did not alter [H-3]- spermidine or [H-3]-MK-801 binding, suggesting that the neuroprotective properties that have been attributed to this compound may not be due to modulation of the NMDA receptor complex at the polyamine binding site. In contrast, structural analogs of dapsone, including N-phenyl-1,4-phenyldiamine and 4,4'diaminoazobenzene, effectively displaced [H-3]-SPD and [H-3]-MK-801. These active dapsone analogs may represent a new class of polyamine binding site ligands that may provide opportunities for the rational design of novel NMDA receptor modulators.

Detailed structure-activity studies have revealed that N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-N-(6-pyrrolidin-1-ylhexyl)guanidine (pK(I) 8.38 +/- 0.21, pK(B) 8.39 +/- 0.13), 30, and N-(4-chlorobenzyl)-N-(7-pyrrolidin-1-ylheptyl)guanidine (pK(I) 8.78 +/- 0.12, pK(B) 8.38 +/- 0.10), 31, exhibit high affinity for the histamine H-3 receptor. Antagonists 30 and 31 demonstrate significant selectivity over the other histamine, H-1 and H-2, receptor subtypes and a 100-fold selectivity in the sigma(1) binding assay. Compounds 30 and 31 are the most potent, selective non-imidazole histamine Ha receptor antagonists reported in the literature to date.

This study investigates the feasibility of deriving accurate mouse-specific time-integrated drug pharmacokinetic data in mouse kidneys from activity measurements using micro-SPECT. Methods An animal experiment was carried out to evaluate the accuracy of I-131 activity quantification in mouse kidneys (mean tissue volume of 0.140 mL) using a micro-SPECT system against conventional ex vivo gamma counting (GC) in a NaI(Tl) detector. The imaging setting investigated was that of the mouse biodistribution of a I-131-labelled single-domain antibody fragment (sdAb), currently being investigated for targeted radionuclide therapy of HER2-expressing cancer. SPECT imaging of I-131 365-keV photons was done with a VECTor/CT system (MILabs, Netherlands) using a high-energy mouse collimator with 1.6-mm-diameter pinholes. For both activity quantification techniques, the pharmacokinetic profile of the radioligand from approximately 1-73 h p.i. was derived and the time-integrated activity coefficient per gram of tissue (a/M) was estimated. Additionally, SPECT activity recovery coefficients were determined in a phantom setting. Results SPECT activities underestimate the reference activities by an amount that is dependent on the I-131 activity concentration in the kidney, and thus on the time point of the pharmacokinetic profile. This underestimation is around - 12% at 1.5 h (2.89 MBq mL(-1) mean reference activity concentration), - 13% at 6.6 h (149 kBq mL(-1)), - 40% at 24 h (17.6 kBq mL(-1)) and - 46% at 73 h (5.2 kBq mL(-1)) p.i. The a/M value estimated from SPECT activities is, nevertheless, within - 14% from the reference (GC) a/M value. Furthermore, better quantitative accuracy (within 2% from GC) in the SPECT a/M value is achieved when SPECT activities are compensated for partial recovery with a phantom-based recovery coefficient of 0.85. Conclusion The SPECT imaging system used, together with a robust activity quantification methodology, allows an accurate estimation of time-integrated pharmacokinetic information of the I-131-labelled sdAb in mouse kidneys. This opens the possibility to perform mouse-specific kidney-tissue dosimetry based on pharmacokinetic data acquired in vivo on the same mice used in nephrotoxicity studies.

Efficacy, safety and prognostic factors affecting overall survival among metastatic prostate cancer patients undergoing treatment with <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA-617: A single center study	REVISTA ESPANOLA DE MEDICINA NUCLEAR E IMAGEN MOLECULAR			English	Article						Lu-177-PSMA; Prostate cancer; PRLT; PSA	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY	Background: Determining the efficacy, safety, and prognostic factors affecting overall survival (OS) among metastatic prostate cancer patients undergoing PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy (PRLT). Method: In this retrospective study, from November 2016 and December 2019, 43 heavily pretreated (90.7% on 1(st) line androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), 53.5% on 2(nd) line ADT, 58.1% on docetaxel) metastatic prostate cancer patients with median age of 71 years (range: 51-88 years) were enrolled. Treatment cycles were repeated every 8 weeks (range: 6-12 weeks). To evaluate the biochemical response after each cycle, prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured and analyzed according to the Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria cutoffs. Possible adverse events after therapy were retrospectively classified according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0. Kaplan-Meier and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with OS. Results: A total of 112 cycles of PRLT with a median of 3 cycles (range: 1-6) and median administered activity per cycle of 6.29 GBq (range: 4.45-7.7 GBq) were used. PSA decline was observed in 65.1% of patients, and best PSA decline of >= 50% and >= 90% were achieved in 39.5% and 23.3% of patients, respectively. Major (grade III) anemia and thrombocytopenia occurred in 11.6% and 7% of patients, respectively. Median OS and median PSA progression-free survival were 52 and 20 weeks, respectively. In univariate analysis, baseline hemoglobin < 11.2 g/dL, baseline platelets count >= 327,000/mu L, PSA decline < 20.94% after first cycle of therapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) > 2, baseline PSA >= 115 ng/ml, cumulative dose of Lu-177-PSMA < 12.95 GBq, initial alkaline phosphatase >= 196.5 U/L, initial lactate dehydrogenase >= 380 U/L and superscan pattern in bone scintigraphy were associated with worse OS. In multivariable Cox regression analysis, higher baseline platelet count, lower baseline hemoglobin, superscan pattern, and lower cumulative dose of Lu-177-PSMA remained significant predictors of poor OS. Conclusion: PRLT with Lu-177-PSMA is well-tolerated and effective in metastatic prostate cancer patients who have no other treatment options available. The novel prognostic markers found in this study (high platelet count, superscan pattern) were associated with poor overall survival.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. on behalf of Sociedad Espanola de Medicina Nuclear e Imagen Molecular.

In Vivo Characterization of a Series of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Diaryl Sulfides (<SUP>18</SUP>F-2-(2′-((Dimethylamino)Methyl)-4′-(Fluoroalkoxy)Phenylthio)Benzenamine) for PET Imaging of the Serotonin Transporter	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						brain imaging; radioligand; SERT; 5-HTT; F-18	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; OCCUPANCY; AGENTS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; METABOLITES; DERIVATIVES	PET of the serotonin transporter (SERT) in the brain is a useful tool for examining normal physiologic functions as well as disease states involving the serotonergic system. The goal of this study was to further develop and refine a series of 4'-fluoroalkoxy-substituted, F-18-radiolabeled SERT imaging agents. 2-(2'-((Dimethylamino)methyl)-4'-(4-F-18-fluorobutoxy)phenylthiol)benzenamine (3) and 2-(2'-((dimethylamino) methyl)-4'-(5-F-18-fluoropentoxy)phenylthiol)benzenamine (4) were synthesized and evaluated along with 2 previously reported compounds of this series, 2-(2'-((dimethylamino) methyl)-4'-(2-F-18-fluoroethoxy)phenylthiol)benzenamine (1) and 2-(2'-((dimethylamino)methyl)4'-(3-F-18-fluoropropoxy)phenylthiol)benzenamine (2). Methods: The in vitro binding affinities of compounds 3 and 4 were determined in monoamine transporter-transfected LLC-PK1 cell homogenates. In vivo localization of the respective F-18-labeled compounds was evaluated by biodistribution studies in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Compound 3 was selected for further examination by autoradiographic and PET studies in rats. Results: The corresponding mesylate precursors of 3 and 4 were radiolabeled with F-18 within 75-90 min. Radiochemical yield was 6%-235%, specific activity was 15-170 GBq/mu mol, and radiochemical purity was greater than 97% (end of synthesis). The compounds showed subnanomolar binding affinities for SERT (inhibition constants, 0.51 and 0.76 nM, respectively), had brain uptake at 2 min of 1.25 and 0.68 percentage injected dose per gram, respectively, and possessed high target-to-nontarget (hypothalamus-to-cerebellum) ratios at 120 min after injection (6.51 and 5.70, respectively). Autoradiographic studies of F-18-3 showed selective localization in SERT-rich brain regions. PET studies of F-18-3 showed clear localization in the midbrain, thalamus, and striatum. Conclusion: This compound series was found to have potential for producing a suitable F-18-radiolabeled PET radiotracer for SERT. Compound 4, the pentoxy derivative, had the lowest brain uptake and target-to-nontarget ratio. Compound 3, the butoxy derivative, had a lower target-to-nontarget ratio than compounds 1 (ethoxy derivative) and 2 (propoxy derivative). Compounds 1 and 2 both hold promise as SERT radioimaging agents, but because of cost limitations, only compound 2 will be evaluated in further studies.

Materials and Methods The mCRPC patients who received at least one cycle of Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT with or without AA therapy, were included and analyzed in the present study. The patients were divided into two major groups. Group 1 received only Lu-177-PSMA PRLT and Group 2 received combined Lu-177-PSMA PRLT + AA therapy. Therapeutic dose of Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT was 4.4-5.55 GBq per patient per cycle administered at intervals of 10-12 weeks in both groups. The Group 2 patients additionally received a dose of 1000 mg of AA once daily and 5 mg of prednisone twice daily. Treatment response in two groups was evaluated under four broad categories (a) symptomatic, (b) biochemical (serum prostate-specific antigen level), (c) objective molecular imaging (Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-FDG PET/CT), and (d) objective anatomical imaging (computed tomography). For assessing treatment response, patients in two groups were categorized into responders (complete response [CR], partial response [PR], and stable disease [SD]) and nonresponders (progressive disease [PD]). The Kaplan-Meier product-limit method was used to calculate PFS and OS following first Lu-177-PSMA PRLT in the two groups. Univariate analysis was used to compare the patients' characteristics in two groups using a chi(2) or Fisher exact test. The Kaplan-Meier curves of PFS and OS between two groups were compared by using the log-rank test (p < 0.05 significant). Results A total of 58 mCRPC patients (Group 1, 38 patients and Group 2, 20 patients) were included in this study analysis. The clinical and demographic characteristics of these patients (age, Gleason score, FDG avid disease, metastatic disease burden, and average number of Lu-177-PSMA PRLT cycles) in two groups were compared and found to be similar (p > 0.05). Post-treatment, symptomatic, biochemical, molecular, and anatomic imaging responders were found in 22 patients (58%) and 17 patients (85%), 22 patients (58%) and 16 patients (80%), 19 patients (54%) and 14 patients (78%), and 19 patients (54%) and 14 patients (78%) in Group 1 and Group 2, respectively. The median PFS of 7 months and median OS of 8 months were documented in Group 1, whereas median PFS was not reached and median OS of 16 months registered in Group 2. Transient hematological toxicity of Grades 1 and 2 was found in total seven patients (five patients in Group 1 and two patients in Group 2). On comparison of the treatment outcome between two groups, significant p value was found for symptomatic responders (58% in Group 1 vs. 85% in Group 2), median PFS (7 months in Group 1 vs. not reached in Group 2), and median OS (8 months in Group 1 vs. 16 months in Group 2), with better outcome in Group 2 patients for these variables. Conclusion In the present study, the combination of Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT and AA therapy showed significant improvement in mCRPC patients' symptomatic response, PFS, and OS as compared to Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT monotherapy.

Many of these functions are regulated by mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system. Preclinical, in vivo, and post-mortem studies have however yielded inconclusive results regarding the role of the MOR in depression and anxiety. Moreover, it is not known whether alterations in MOR are already present in subclinical depression and anxiety. In a large-scale retrospective cross-sectional study we pooled data from 135 (113 males and 22 females) healthy subjects whose brain's MOR availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) using an agonist radioligand [C-11]carfentanil that has high affinity for MORs. Depressive and anxious symptomology was addressed with BDI-II and STAI-X questionnaires, respectively. Both anxiety and depression scores in the subclinical range were negatively associated with MOR availability in cortical and subcortical areas, notably in amygdala, hippocampus, ventral striatum, and orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices. We conclude that dysregulated MOR availability is involved in altered mood and pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders.

This case-control study evaluated 265 women of reproductive age who presented at gynaecology clinics of three hospitals in Mashhad, Iran. While women in the ovarian cyst group [n=132] had functional ovarian cysts, control group [n=133] consisted of women without functional ovarian cysts. The participants' vitamin A, vitamin E, and folate intake was assessed using the Food Frequency Questionnaire. Results showed that folate intake was significantly higher in the ovarian cyst group [p=.040]. No significant differences in vitamin A and vitamin E intake were observed between the two groups [p=.950 and .230, respectively]. It is concluded that women with functional ovarian cysts had significantly higher folate intake. Vitamin A and vitamin E intake had no significant effects on the incidence of these cysts.

We used positron emission tomography scanning with the selective MOR radioligand [C-11] carfentanil to test the hypothesis that MOR system activation (reflecting endogenous opioid release) in response to social rejection and acceptance is altered in medication-free patients diagnosed with current major depressive disorder (MDD, n = 17) compared with healthy controls (HCs, n = 18). During rejection, MDD patients showed reduced endogenous opioid release in brain regions regulating stress, mood and motivation, and slower emotional recovery compared with HCs. During acceptance, only HCs showed increased social motivation, which was positively correlated with endogenous opioid release in the nucleus accumbens, a reward structure. Altered endogenous opioid activity in MDD may hinder emotional recovery from negative social interactions and decrease pleasure derived from positive interactions. Both effects may reinforce depression, trigger relapse and contribute to poor treatment outcomes.	[Hsu, D. T.] SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Psychiat, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA; [Hsu, D. T.; Sanford, B.

Removal of Human Ether-a-go-go Related Gene (hERG) K<SUP>+</SUP> Channel Affinity through Rigidity: A Case of Clofilium Analogues	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POTASSIUM CHANNELS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; INHIBITORS; EFFICIENT; RECEPTOR; LIGANDS; BINDING; OPTIMIZATION; CONFORMATION; DISCOVERY	Cardiotoxicity is a side effect that plagues modern drug design and is very often due to the off-target blockade of the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) potassium channel. To better understand the structural determinants of this blockade, we designed and synthesized a series of 40 derivatives of clofilium, a class III antiarrhythrnic agent. These were evaluated in radioligand binding and patch-damp assays to establish structure affinity relationships (SAR) for this potassium channel. Efforts were especially focused on studying the influence of the structural rigidity and the nature of the linkers composing the clofilium scaffold. It was shown that introducing triple bonds and oxygen atoms in the n-butyl linker of the molecule greatly reduced affinity without significantly modifying the pK(a) of the essential basic nitrogen. These findings could prove useful in the first stages of drug discovery as a systematic way of reducing the risk of hERG K+ channel blockade-induced cardiotoxicity.	[Louvel, Julien; Carvalho, Joao F.

All the chromone-3-carboxamides (compounds 8-12) exhibit A(2B) receptor displacement percentage superior to 50%. The best results were obtained with phenolic substituents (compounds 9 and 12) in the position 3 of pyrone ring with a K-i value of 2890 and 1350 nM. In addition, the predicted ADME properties for the chromone carboxamides under study are in accordance with the general requirements for the drug discovery and development process and in turn they have potential to emerge as a drug candidate. In summary, N-phenylchromone-3-carboxamide may be proposed as a promising scaffold that can undergo optimization as a selective A(2B)AR antagonist given its lower affinity for A(1)AR and A(2A)AR. Accordingly, one can propose this new chromone class as a promising scaffold for tackling adenosine receptors, namely of A(2B) subtype. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Synthesis and evaluation of novel tropane derivatives as potential PET imaging agents for the dopamine transporter	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Dopamine transporter; Tropane; Fluorine-18; Imaging tracers; PET	IN-VIVO EVALUATION; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; HUMAN BRAIN; RADIOSYNTHESIS; VISUALIZATION; LIGAND; QUANTIFICATION; F-18-FECNT; COCAINE; SYSTEM	A novel series of tropane derivatives containing a fluorinated tertiary amino or amide at the 2 beta position was synthesized, labeled with the positron-emitter fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min), and tested as potential in vivo dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging agents. The corresponding chlorinated analogs were prepared and employed as precursors for radiolabeling leading to the fluorine-18-labeled derivatives via a one-step nucleophilic aliphatic substitution reaction. In vitro binding results showed that the 2 beta-amino compounds 6b, 6d and 7b displayed moderately high affinities to DAT (K-i < 10 nM). Biodistribution studies of [F-18]6b and [F-18]6d showed that the brain uptakes in rats were low. This is likely due to their low lipophilicities. Further structural modifications of these tropane derivatives will be needed to improve their in vivo properties as DAT imaging agents. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Stabilization of the extracellular loop 1 (EL1) by pi-stacking clusters proved to be important for agonist binding when substitution of six conserved amino acids by alanine resulted in an agonist specific loss of maximal binding capacity. In agreement with our modeling studies, EL1 seems to adopt a clamp-type border area controlling the shape of the binding site crevice. Employing chemically manipulated peptide analogs as molecular probes, the impact of backbone modi. cations on receptor-ligand interaction, especially the influence on ligand conformation, was examined in binding studies and explained by in silico analysis.

The results showed that AT-1015 displayed high affinity to 5-HT2 receptors in rabbit platelet membranes. The pK(i) value of AT-1015 was 7.40, which is slightly lower than that of ketanserin, but higher than that of cyproheptadine. On the other hand, the displacement potency of AT-1015 for 5-HT2 receptors in rabbit platelets was similar to those of sarpogrelate and ritanserin. This is the first report of the high affinity of AT-1015 in rabbit platelets.

Control and preblocking studies were performed in anesthetized monkeys. Plasma radioactive metabolite analysis showed the presence of [F-18]FC and [F-18]fluoride. Tissue time-radioactivity curves were corrected for metabolite contamination based on separate positron-emission tomography studies of these two labeled metabolites. Analysis using a two-tissue compartment model gave distribution volume (V) estimates (mL/mL) ranging from 33 in frontal cortex to 4 in cerebellum. Preblocking data showed uniform V of 2-3 mL/mL.

Aiming at the development of a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer to monitor receptor density and/or occupancy during a CB2R-tailored therapy, we herein describe the radiosynthesis of cis-[F-18]1-(4-fluorobutyl-N-((1s,4s)-4-methylcyclohexyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxamide ([F-18]LU14) starting from the corresponding mesylate precursor. The first biological evaluation revealed that [F-18]LU14 is a highly affine CB2R radioligand with >80% intact tracer in the brain at 30 min p.i. Its further evaluation by PET in a well-established rat model of CB2R overexpression demonstrated its ability to selectively image the CB2R in the brain and its potential as a tracer to further investigate disease-related changes in CB2R expression.

In mammals and fungi, two distinct classes of inositol phosphate kinases mediate biosynthesis of inositol pyrophosphates: Kcs1/IP6K- and Vip1/PPIP5K-like proteins. Here, we report that PPIP5K homologs are widely distributed in plants and that Arabidopsis thaliana VIH1 and VIH2 are functional PPIP5K enzymes. We show a specific induction of inositol pyrophosphate InsP(8) by jasmonate and demonstrate that steady state and jasmonate-induced pools of InsP(8) in Arabidopsis seedlings depend on VIH2. We identify a role of VIH2 in regulating jasmonate perception and plant defenses against herbivorous insects and necrotrophic fungi. In silico docking experiments and radioligand binding-based reconstitution assays show high-affinity binding of inositol pyrophosphates to the F-box protein COI1-JAZ jasmonate coreceptor complex and suggest that coincidence detection of jasmonate and InsP(8) by COI1-JAZ is a critical component in jasmonate-regulated defenses.

Semiquantitative real-time PCR and radioligand binding studies, using a wide set of antagonist compounds, showed the co-existence of M(3), M(4), and M(5) subtypes. Stimulation of these subpopulations caused a concentration and time- dependent activation of second messengers and ERK signaling pathways, with a major contribution of the M(3) subtype in a G(q/11)-mediated response. In addition, we found that T-cell stimulation leads to increased expression of M(3) and M(5) both at transcriptional and protein levels in a PLC/PKC theta dependent manner. Our data clarifies the functional role of AChR subtypes in Jurkat cells and pave the way to future studies on the potential cross-talk among these subpopulations and their regulation of T lymphocytes immune function.

AGE-RELATED LOSS OF OLFACTORY SENSITIVITY: ASSOCIATION TO DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER BINDING IN PUTAMEN	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						olfaction; dopamine; striatum; putamen; aging	ODOR IDENTIFICATION; PET; DISEASE; TRANSMISSION; RECOGNITION; YOUNG	The relationship between age-related reductions in the binding potential for the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and age-related deficits in olfactory sensitivity was examined in 12 subjects ranging from 36 to 82 years of age. Positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [C-11]]beta-CIT-FE were used to determine DAT binding in two striatal regions, the caudate and the putamen. The results showed age-related losses of DAT binding from early to late adulthood of similar size for caudate and putamen, and there was a pronounced age deterioration in olfactory sensitivity. Importantly, the age-related olfactory deficit was associated with reductions in DAT binding in putamen, but not caudate. Also, DAT binding in putamen added systematic variance in odor threshold after controlling for age. The findings indicate that DAT binding in putamen is related to age-related olfactory deficits, as well as to odor sensitivity independently of age. (c) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The subsequent isolation procedure yielded the known alkaloids californidine (1), escholtzine (2), N-methyllaurotetanine (3), caryachine (4), and O-methylcaryachine (5), along with a new pavine alkaloid, 6S,12S-neocaryachine-7-O-methyl ether N-metho salt (7). The structure of 7 was determined by spectroscopic data interpretation, while the absolute stereochemistry was determined by means of circular dichroism. From the results obtained from the radioligand-binding assay of the pure compounds, including the commercially available protopine (6), it was evident that the activity on the 5-HT,A receptor was at least partly due to the presence of the aporphine alkaloid 3, which showed the highest inhibition of [H-3]8-hydroxy-2-(di-N-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]8-OH-DPAT) binding with an EC50 value of 155 nM and a Ki of 85 nM.

When made available to rhesus monkeys (11 = 4) for self-administration, (+)-pseudoephedrine functioned as a positive reinforcer in all monkeys, as did (-)-pseudoephedrine in two of three monkeys. Pseudoephedrine isomers were 10- to 33-fold less potent than cocaine. In in vitro binding in monkey brain tissue, both isomers had low affinity for dopamine and serotonin transporters by at least 200-fold relative to cocaine, but comparable affinity for norepinephrine transporters. (+)-Pseudoephedrine also blocked dopamine uptake in 293 hDAT cells with low potency relative to cocaine. When given in vivo (+)-pseudoephedrine significantly displaced radioligand binding to dopamine transporters with a potency comparable to that in self-administration. Therefore, pseudoephedrine isomers can function as reinforcers and the mechanism at dopamine transporters may underlie this effect. However, pseudoephedrine appears to be a weak reinforcer and may have relatively low abuse potential. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods: Twelve patients from families with high loading of depression living in a geographically restricted region were examined and compared with normal control subjects. At the time of the PET measurement all patients were remitted; in some of them remission was sustained by antidepressive medication. Binding potential was assessed by Logan's graphical analysis method. Results: The binding of F-18-altanserin was about 38% lower in patients than in healthy controls (p <0.001). A multiple regression analysis revealed that this difference was mainly induced by depression rather than by medication. Conclusions: The data suggest that 5HT2 receptors are altered in depression. We present evidence for a reduction of the receptor density, which might be usable as trait marker of subjects susceptible for depressive illness.

However, many patients do not qualify for these treatments due to prior interventions or tumor location. Such oligometastatic patients could benefit from radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA; a novel tumor targeting therapy for end-stage metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Especially because RLT could be more effective in low volume disease, such as the oligometastatic status, due to high uptake of radioligands in smaller lesions. To test the hypothesis that Lu-177-PSMA is an effective treatment in oHSPC to prolong PFS and postpone the need for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), we initiated a multicenter randomized clinical trial. This is globally, the first prospective study using Lu-177-PSMA-I&T in a randomized multicenter setting.Methods & designThis study compares Lu-177-PSMA-I&T MDT to the current standard of care (SOC); deferred ADT. Fifty-eight patients with oHSPC (<= 5 metastases on PSMA PET) and high PSMA uptake (SUVmax >15, partial volume corrected) on F-18-PSMA PET after prior surgery and/or EBRT and a PSA doubling time of <6months, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio. The patients randomized to the interventional arm will be eligible for two cycles of 7.4GBq Lu-177-PSMA-I&T at a 6-week interval. After both cycles, patients are monitored every 3 weeks (including adverse events, QoL- and xerostomia questionnaires and laboratory testing) at the outpatient clinic. Twenty-fourweeks after cycle two an end of study evaluation is planned together with another F-18-PSMA PET and (whole body) MRI. Patients in the SOC arm are eligible to receive Lu-177-PSMA-I&T after meeting the primary study objective, which is the fraction of patients who show disease progression during the study follow up. A second primary objective is the time to disease progression. Disease progression is defined as a 100% increase in PSA from baseline or clinical progression.DiscussionThis is the first prospective randomized clinical study assessing the therapeutic efficacy and toxicity of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T for patients with oHSPC.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04443062.

PET imaging of the dopamine transporter with <SUP>18</SUP>F-FECNT:: A polar radiometabolite confounds brain radioligand measurements	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						in vivo metabolism; dopamine transporter; receptor; F-18-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl); nortropane	METABOLISM; SPECT; QUANTIFICATION; FLUOROACETATE; IOMAZENIL; ACETATE; BINDING; RATS	F-18-2 beta-Carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl)- nortropane (F-18-FECNT), a PET radioligand for the dopamine transporter (DAT), generates a radiometabolite that enters the rat brain. The aims of this study were to characterize this radiometabolite and to determine whether a similar phenomenon occurs in human and nonhuman primate brains by examining the stability of the apparent distribution volume in DAT-rich (striatum) and DAT-poor (cerebellum) regions of the brain. Methods: Two rats were infused with F-18-FECNT and sacrificed at 60 min. Extracts of brain and plasma were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) techniques. Two human participants and 3 rhesus monkeys were injected with F-18-FECNT and scanned kinetically, with serial arterial blood analysis. Results: At 60 min after the injection of rats, F-18-FECNT accumulated to levels about 7 times higher in the striatum than in the cortex and cerebellum. The radiometabolite was distributed at equal concentrations in all brain regions. The LC-MS techniques identified N-clealkylated FECNT as a major metabolite in the rat brain, and reverse-phase HPLC detected an equivalent amount of radiometabolite eluting with the void volume. The radiometabolite likely was F-18-fluoroacetaidehyde, the product expected from the N-clealkylation of F-18-FECNT, or its oxidation product, F-18-fluoroacetic acid. The distribution volume in the cerebellum increased up to 1.7-fold in humans between 60 and 300 min after injection and 2.0 +/- 0.1 -fold (mean +/- SD; n = 3) in nonhuman primates between 60 and 240 min after injection. Conclusion: An F-18-fluoroalkyl metabolite of F-18-FECNT origiinating in the periphery confounded the measurements of DAT in the rat brain with a reference tissue model. Its uniform distribution across brain regions suggests that it has negligible affinity for DAT (i.e., it is an inactive radiometabolite). Consistent with the rodent data, the apparent distribution volume in the cerebellum of both humans and nonhuman primates showed a continual increase at late times after injection, a result that may be attributed to entry of the radiometabolite into the brain. Thus, reference tissue modeling of F-18-FECNT will be prone to more errors than analysis with a measured arterial input function.

Characterization of endothelial thromboxane receptors in rabbit aorta	PROSTAGLANDINS & OTHER LIPID MEDIATORS			English	Article						Thromboxane; Endothelial cells; Receptor; Cell migration	A(2) RECEPTOR; BETA ISOFORMS; CELL MIGRATION; TP-ALPHA; ARACHIDONIC-ACID; HUMAN PLATELETS; NITRIC-OXIDE; A2 RECEPTOR; IN-VITRO; ANGIOGENESIS	An increased synthesis of thromboxane (TX) A(2) is associated with a number of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, unstable angina and hypertension. We previously identified a subgroup of NZW rabbits in which isolated arteries failed to contract to the TX agonists, U46619 or I-BOP. In vascular smooth muscle membranes, there was a significant decrease in TX receptors, termed TP. These rabbits are referred to as vTP- and those with the TP receptor are called vTP+. Because TP receptors are expressed in some types of endothelial cells, the present study was designed to determine whether functional TP receptors are present in endothelial cells cultured from aortas of vTP+ and vTP- rabbits. Radioligand binding studies were performed with (125)I-BOP. Aortic endothelial cells from vTP+ rabbits exhibited specific and saturable binding. In contrast, in endothelial preparations from vTP- rabbit aortas, no measurable binding to (125)I-BOP was detected. Using an anti-TP receptor antibody, we compared the amount of receptor expressed in endothelial cell lysates obtained from vTP+ and vTP- rabbits. Consistent with the results observed radioligand binding assays, the expression of TP receptor protein was decreased in vTP- compared to vTP+ endothelial cells. An in vitro wound healing assay was used on confluent monolayers of endothelial cells. In the untreated vTP+ cells, the area of the scratch was completely closed by 30 h. In the vTP+ cells treated with 046619 (3 mu M), the rate of closure of the scratch area was reduced with approximately 12% of the scratch area remaining at 30 h. Pretreatment with the TP receptor antagonist, SQ 29548 (10 mu M) prevented the inhibitory effect of U46619. The rate of closure of the scratch in the vTP- was not altered by U46619. In a separate study, U46619 (3 mu M) increased the release of 6-keto PGF(1 alpha), the stable metabolite of prostacyclin, in vTP+ but not vTP- endothelial cells. Pretreatment with SQ29548 (10 mu M) or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 mu M) blocked the increase in vTP+endothelial cells. In vascular reactivity studies in aortas from vTP+ rabbits, removal of the endothelium enhanced the vasoconstrictor response to U46619 indicating that activation of endothelial TP receptors may modulate vascular tone via the release of the vasodilator, prostacyclin. The results of this study suggest an important role for endothelial TP receptors in modulating vascular function. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Eight cortical regions (left and right fronto-, temporo-, parieto-, and occipitocortical area), one global subcortical region (including the thalamic system) were compared with a reference region lacking receptors; that is, the cerebellum. The I-123 labeled radioligand was injected intravenously 100-200 minutes before acquisition. Both transmission and emission data were obtained with a triple head gamma camera equipped with high-resolution fanbeam collimators. The emission data were corrected for scatter and attenuation. To delineate different cerebral regions more accurately, the regions of interest (ROI) defined in a former study on brain perfusion measured with Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD) in the same dogs were used. The co-registration of the Tc-99m-ECD and the I-123-5-I-R91150, obtained from each dog, was realized with the help of corresponding transmission maps. By normalizing each regional cerebral activity to the activity observed in the cerebellum, the regional radioactivity (binding index) could be relatively quantified. Highest brain uptake was noted in the frontocortical brain areas (right: 1.85, left: 1.89), followed by the temporocortical region (right: 1.58, left: 1.56). Least uptake was noted in the more caudal and middle brain regions [occipito- (right: 1.46, left: 1.41), parietocortical (right: 1.30, left: 1.26), and striatal region (1.19)]. No gender nor age influence was noted in this series. The I-123 labeled serotonin-2A receptor ligand seems to have similar cortical binding in the normal canine brain, as shown in humans and other animal species. A frontocortical to occipitocortical (rostrocaudal) binding index gradient was identified within the dog, which has not been seen in imaging studies from humans and other animal species. The significance of these results will need further investigation. This normative data can be used to compare regional brain uptake of the I-123-radioligand to dogs with behavioral disorders related to the serotonergic system, in future studies.

Therefore, a simulation study was performed focusing on the determination of efficient optimal sampling schedules (OSS) for renal and tumour dosimetry by investigating different numbers of time points (TPs). Methods Sampling schedules with 1-4 TPs were investigated. Time-activity curves of the kidneys and two tumour lesions were generated based on a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model and biokinetic data of 13 patients who have undergone [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA I&T therapy. Systematic and stochastic noise of different ratios was considered when modelling time-activity data sets. Time-integrated activity coefficients (TIACs) were estimated by simulating the hybrid planar/SPECT method for schedules comprising at least two TPs. TIACs based on one single SPECT/CT measurement were estimated using an approximation for reducing the number of fitted parameters. For each sampling schedule, the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the deviations of the simulated TIACs from the ground truths for 1000 replications was used as a measure for accuracy and precision. Results All determined OSS included a late measurement at 192 h p.i., which was necessary for accurate and precise tumour TIACs. OSS with three TPs were identified to be 3-4, 96-100 and 192 h with an additional SPECT/CT measurement at the penultimate TP. Kidney and tumour RMSE of 6.4 to 7.7% and 6.3 to 7.8% were obtained, respectively. Shortening the total time for dosimetry to e.g. 96 h resulted in kidney and tumour RMSE of 6.8 to 8.3% and 9.1 to 11%, respectively. OSS with four TPs showed similar results as with three TPs. Planar images at 4 and 68 h and a SPECT/CT shortly after the 68 h measurement led to kidney and tumour RMSE of 8.4 to 12% and 12 to 16%, respectively. One single SPECT/CT measurement at 52 h yielded good approximations for the kidney TIACs (RMSE of 7.0%), but led to biased tumour TIACs. Conclusion OSS allow improvements in accuracy and precision of renal and tumour dosimetry for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy with potentially less effort. A late TP is important regarding accurate tumour TIACs.

We have taken advantage of the N-6-methyl substitution in the adenine base to incorporate [H-3] methylamine into the synthesis of [H-3] MRS2279 to high (89 Ci/mmol) specific radioactivity and have used this molecule as a radioligand for the P2Y1-R. [H-3] MRS2279 bound to membranes from Sf9 insect cells expressing recombinant human P2Y1-R but not to membranes from wild-type Sf9 cells or Sf9 cells expressing high levels of recombinant P2Y(2) or P2Y(12) receptors. Equilibrium binding of [H-3] MRS2279 to P2Y1-R expressed in Sf9 membranes was with a high affinity (K-d = 8 nM) essentially identical to the apparent affinity of MRS2279 determined previously in studies of P2Y1-R-promoted inositol phosphate accumulation or platelet aggregation. A kinetically derived K-d calculated from independent determinations of the rate constants of association (7.15 x 10(7) M-1 min(-1)) and dissociation (0.72 min(-1))of [H-3] MRS2279 also was in good agreement with the K-d derived from equilibrium binding studies. Competition binding assays with [H-3] MRS2279 and P2Y1-R expressing Sf9 cell membranes revealed K-i values for the P2Y1-R antagonists MRS2279 (K-i = 13 nM), N-6-methyl-2'-deoxyadenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (MRS2179; K-i = 84 nM), adenosine-3',5'-bisphosphate (K-i = 900 nM), and pyridoxal phosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulfonic acid (K-i = 6 muM) that were in good agreement with antagonist activities of these molecules previously determined at the P2Y1-R in intact tissues. Moreover, [H-3] MRS2279 also bound with high affinity (K-d = 4-8 nM) to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells stably expressing the human P2Y1-R, but specific binding was not observed in wild-type CHO or 1321N1 cells. [H-3] MRS2279 bound with high affinity (K-d = 16 nM) to a binding site on out-dated human platelets (5-35 receptors/platelet) and rat brain membranes (210 fmol/mg protein) that fit the expected drug selectivity of a P2Y1-R. Taken together, these results indicate that [H-3] MRS2279 is the first broadly applicable antagonist radioligand for a P2Y receptor.

The current multicentre retrospective analysis aims to evaluate the response rate to RLT, the overall survival (OS) of patients and the safety of the treatment according to the extent of bone involvement. Methods The study included patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), who underwent RLT with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 and a follow-up of at least 6 months. Tumour burden in the bone was classified prior to RLT as follows: less than 6 lesions, 6-20 lesions, more than 20 lesions and diffuse involvement. The response rate was evaluated using changes of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after the first treatment cycle. Overall survival was calculated from the date of the first treatment. Haematological adverse events were classified according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 5.0. Results A total of 319 males were included in the analysis. The extent of bone metastases and PSA response did not correlate significantly. Any PSA decline was observed in 73% patients; 44% showed a decline of >= 50%. The median OS of patient in the different subgroups was 18 months (less than 6 lesions), 13 months (6-20 lesions), 11 months (more than 20 lesions) and 8 months (diffuse involvement), respectively (p < 0.0001). Patients with prior Ra-223-therapy showed longer OS in all subgroups, especially in the subgroups with 6-20 lesions (OS: 16 vs. 12 months; p = 0.038) as well as diffuse involvement (OS: 11 vs. 7 months; p = 0.034). Significant negative prognosticators of OS were the existence of liver metastases in all subgroups and prior chemotherapy in patients with p < 0.0001 and 0.005, respectively. No patient showed a high grade leukopenia. Conclusion The extent of bone involvement correlated negatively with the OS after RLT; however, it showed no relevant correlation with the PSA response rate. Prior therapy with Ra-223 may have a positive impact on OS. Haematotoxicity was higher in patients with more than 20 bone lesions; nevertheless, the majority of these patients did not show a relevant haematotoxicity.

Inhibition of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]batrachotoxinin A-20α-benzoate binding to sodium channels and sodium channel function by endocannabinoids	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						endocannabinoids; [H-3]batrachotoxinin binding; sodium channel; L-glutarnate and GABA release; membrane potential; mouse brain	CANNABINOID RECEPTOR-LIGAND; ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS; PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN CONSTITUENT; MOUSE-BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; ANANDAMIDE; NEURONS; CELLS; 20-ALPHA-BENZOATE	A number of putative endocannabinoids were found to modify the binding of [H-3]batrachotoxinin A-20 alpha-benzoate ([H-3]BTX-B) to site 2 on voltage-gated sodium channels of mouse brain and achieve functional inhibition of sodium channels in vitro. 2-Arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), arachidonoyl glycerol ether (AGE), N-arachidonoyl-dopamine (NADA) gave almost complete inhibition of [H-3]BTX-B binding with IC50 values of 90.4. 51.2 and 20.7 mu M, respectively. The CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 (2 mu M) had no effect on the displacement of radioligand by these endocanabinoids. Arachidonoyl-glycine (A-Gly) and arachidonoyl-GABA (A-GABA) were apparently less effective inhibitors of [H-3]BTX-B binding giving 14.8 +/- 2.2 and 23.9 +/- 4.8% inhibition at 100 mu M. Phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (PMSF) did not alter the inhibitory effects of 2-AG, AGE, NADA and A-Gly on binding, but the efficacy of 100 mu M A-GABA was increased by 60.3 +/- 6.3% (P < 0.05). Scatchard analyses showed that 2-AG, AGE and NADA reduce the binding of [H-3]BTX-B by lowering B-max although increases in K-D were also evident for AGE and NADA. Our kinetic experiments found that 2-AG, AGE and NADA increase the dissociation velocity of radioligand from site 2 on sodium channels demonstrating that these endocannabinoids operate as allosteric inhibitors of [H-3]BTX-B binding. 2-AG, AGE and NADA inhibited veratridine-dependent (TTX-suppressible) depolarization of the plasma membrane of synaptoneurosomes at low micromolar concentrations and again the capacities of A-Gly and A-GABA to inhibit this response were less pronounced. The three most effective endocannabinoids (2-AG, AGE and NADA) were then examined in a synaptosomal transmitter release assay where they were observed to inhibit sodium channel- (veratridine-dependent) release of L-glutamate and GABA in the low micromolar range. These effects also occured through a mechanism that was not influenced by 2 mu M AM251. It is concluded that direct inhibition of sodium channel function leading to reduced neuronal excitation and depression of presynaptic release of amino acid transmitters is a property shared by several endocannabinoids.

Fourteen analogs of NKA(4-10) were produced with substitutions at positions 4, 5, 7, 9 and/or 10 of NKA. Their potencies were determined by in vitro contractile responses and affinities by radioligand binding using [I-125]NKA. Functional potency was enhanced 8-fold by single amino acid substitutions with Lys(5) and MeLeu(9) but not significantly altered by substitutions Glu(4), Arg(5), His(5) and Nle(10). The multiply-substituted analogs [MeLeu9, Nle(10)]NKA(4-10), [Lys(5),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) and [Lys(5),(Tyr(7)),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) displayed 6-9-fold increase in potency. Although [Arg(5),Nle(10)]NKA(4-1 0) was similar in potency to NKA(4-1 0), it was the only analog to show significantly reduced efficacy. All analogs were able to compete fully for [I-125]NKA binding. [Lys(5),MeLeu9JNKA (4-10), [MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-1 0), [Lys(5),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) and analogs containing single substitutions with Glu(4),Arg(5),Lys(5) and MeLeu(9) displayed significantly higher affinity, whereas those with Nle(10) and [Glu(4),Nle(10)] substitutions showed significantly lower affinity than NKA(4-10). There was a positive correlation (r = 0.63) between binding affinity and functional potency, which was markedly improved (r = 0.95) by removal of three analogs: [Lys(5),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10), Lys(5),Tyr(7),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) and [Lys(5),Tyr(I-2)(7),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10). These exhibited similar binding affinities to that of NKA(4-10) but were more potent in functional studies, possibly indicating a different mechanism of receptor interaction. In conclusion, substitution of Ser(5) with Lys, and/or N-methylation of Leu(9), were the most effective changes to increase functional and binding potency of NKA(4-10) at the human colon NK2 receptor.

Ligands that are able to selectively modulate one receptor subtype can delay or slow down the progression of diverse diseases. In this context, our research group focused its investigation into the discovery and development of novel, potent and selective AR ligands based on coumarin scaffold. Therefore, a series of 3-phenylcarboxamidocoumarins were synthesized and their affinity for the human AR subtypes was screened by radioligand binding assays for A(1), A(2A) and A(3) receptors and for A(2B) by adenylyl cyclase assay. Compound 26 was found to be the most remarkable, with a hA(1)/hA(3) and hA(2A)/hA(3) selectivity of 42, for the A(3) AR (K-i=2.4m). Receptor-driven molecular modelling studies have provided valuable information on the binding/selectivity data of compound 26 and for the following optimization process. Moreover, compound 26 presents drug-like properties according to the general guidelines linked to the concept.

Radioligand binding Studies indicated excellent D-3 affinity and selectivity over related GPCRs for the terminal alkynes 4c (FAUC 460) and 5c. Biphasic displacement Curves gave picomolar K-i values for the high affinity binding site of D-3. According to mitogenesis experiments and bioluminescence based cAMP assays, the biphenylcarboxamide 4c and its click chemistry derived triazole analogue 5c behaved as strong partial agonists but relative ligand efficacy significantly depended on the type of functional assay. Site directed mutagenesis involving the mutants D-3 D3.32E, and D-3 F6.51W implied that ligand interactions with D3.32 and F6.51 are highly crucial. giving rise to analogous binding modes for dopamine, classical and enyne type agonists.

As atypical antipsychotics like clozapine antagonize the 5-HT2AR and reduce 5-HT2AR density, it cannot be ruled out that a prefrontal decrease of 5-HT2AR density observed in postmortem brains from patients with schizophrenia is triggered by antipsychotic drug effects. Today, little is known about the 5-HT2AR in vivo status before the first psychotic episode and before the exposure to antipsychotics. Into this void comes our pilot study in which we used the radioligand [F-18]altan-serin and positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate individuals at increased risk of developing schizophrenia. We identified decreases of 5-HT2AR availability in orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that disease-related abnormalities of serotonergic neurotransmission emerge in brain areas involved in affective and cognitive processes, dysfunctions of which are core representations of the schizophrenic phenotype.

The human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells expressed by cDNA of a1D-AR subtypes were cultured and cell membrane stationary phase (CMSP) was prepared. Then the interactions between ligands and a1D-AR in CMSP were investigated using CMC. The affinity rank order to alpha(1D)-AR subtype obtained from CMC for the nine alpha(1)-adrenoceceptor ligands is: prazosin, BMY7378, phentolamine, oxymetazoline, 5-methylurapidil, norepinephrine, phenylephrine, methoxamine, RS-17053. The affinity rank order is similar and correlates well with that obtained from others' radioligand binding assays (RBA). CMSP prepared by transfected HEK293 cells with alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor cDNA and CMC method could be used to evaluate affinities of drug-receptor and drug-receptor subtypes and to screen drugs selective to a1D-AR.

Here we show that despite a mutation in the beta interaction domain that has previously been shown to disrupt binding, alpha(1C)Y467S and beta(1a-myc) still formed immunoprecipitable complexes when coexpressed in tsA201 cells. However, the alpha(1C)Y467S-beta(1a-myc) complexes had a decreased affinity to (+)-[H-3]isradipine. This indicates that the beta interaction domain in the I-II loop of the alpha(1) subunit is not merely an anchor required for the functional interaction of the two Ca2+ channel subunits but is itself part of the effector pathway for beta-induced channel modulation.

In the present study, evidence is provided that stimulation of human Cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) induces the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA and subsequently increases intracellular CA levels through protein kinase C (PKC) activation and the contribution of intracellular Ca2+-dependent mechanisms. Increased production of CA in PHA-stimulated PBMCs suggests a preferential involvement of catecholaminergic pathways in the functional modulation of activated cells. These findings may help to better define the role of immunocompetent cell-derived CA in the neuroimmune network. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The residual t-test has been utilized to improve the sensitivity of the t-test in PET studies. However, no further development of statistical tests using residuals has been proposed so far to be applied in cases when there are more than two conditions. Here, we propose the residual f-test, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and examine its feasibility using simulated [C-11] raclopride PET data. We also re-visit data from our previously published [C-11] raclopride PET study, in which 10 individuals underwent three PET scans under different conditions. We found that the residual f-test is superior in terms of sensitivity than the conventional f-test while still controlling for type 1 error. The test will therefore allow us to reliably test hypotheses in the smaller sample sizes often used in explorative PET studies.

Probing the limits of molecular imprinting: strategies with a template of limited size and functionality	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR RECOGNITION			English	Article						molecular imprinting; propofol; sacrificial spacer; radioligand binding; NMR	OPENING METATHESIS POLYMERIZATION; LIGAND-BINDING; POLYMERS; RECOGNITION; MIMICS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; BUPIVACAINE; TECHNOLOGY; DIPRIFUSOR; RECEPTORS	A series of polymers molecularly imprinted with the general anaesthetic propofol were synthesized using both semi- and non-covalent approaches. The polymers were evaluated with respect to template rebinding in both aqueous and organic media. In aqueous media, the observed propofol binding in these polymer systems was largely hydrophobic and non-specific in nature. In non-polar solvents such as hexane, electrostatic (hydrogen bonding) interactions dominate resulting in some selectivity. The implication of these results, in conjunction with those obtained using structures of similar size in other studies, is that propofol, a template possessing limited functionality and size, appears to define the lower limit for template size and degree of functionalization that can be used for the creation of ligand-selective recognition sites in molecularly imprinted polymers. Furthermore, studies with alternative ligands indicate that the steric crowding of a ligand's functionality to the polymer contributes to the extent of polymer-ligand recognition.

The composite nanofibers form non-woven mats that can be used as affinity membrane to greatly simplify solid phase extraction of drug residues in analytical samples. Upward 100% of propranolol-imprinted nanoparticles can be easily encapsulated into poly(ethylene terephthalate) nanofibers, ensuring the composite materials to have a high specific binding capacity. As confirmed by radioligand binding analysis, the specific binding sites in the composite materials remain easily accessible and are chiral-selective. Using the new composite nanofiber mats as solid phase extraction materials, trace amount of propranolol (I ng mL(-1)) in tap water can be easily detected after a simple sample preparation. As validated in this study, there is no problem of template leakage from the composite nanofibers. Without the solid phase extraction, the existence of propranolol residues in water cannot be confirmed with even tandem HPLC-MS/MS analysis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The synthesised and tested derivatives comprise 5-tetrazolyl, 1,3,4-oxadiazol-5-yl-2-one, and indole-2-carboxylic acid amides with 5-aminotetrazole, methanesulphonamide and trifluoromethanesulphonamide moieties. The binding affinity was evaluated using [H-3]MDL 105,519 and pig cortical brain membranes. In general, compounds with acidic functions different from a carboxylic acid moiety are less potent than indole-2-carboxylic acid derivatives. Also, the 4,6-dichloro substitution pattern was compared to 5-tert-butyl derivatives and compounds not substituted in the benzene moiety of the indole, indicating that the affinity increases from 5-tert-butyl over unsubstituted to 4,6-dichloro substituted derivatives.

Measures taken without a real understanding of the underlying pathology are unlikely to be effective. It would therefore be not only of pathophysiological but also of clinical relevance to develop a research paradigm to investigate this aberrant behavior in dogs. The first aim of this article is to review the literature concerning functional-anatomical and biochemical research on animal impulsivity. On the basis of this research, a hypothesis involving the prefrontal serotonin-2A receptor in the frontal cortex is generated and the feasibility of quantifying the 5-HT2A receptor with Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) and the highly selective receptor radioligand I-123-5I-R91150 is presented in a pilot study. If confirmed, this hypothesis may lead to the development of an in vivo research tool for investigating behavioral disorders and a modality for monitoring the effects of pharmacologic interventions and behavior therapy.

Its insecticidal properties were discovered decades ago and this stimulated the development of a variety of insecticides such as Cartap that are readily transformed into NTX. One unusual feature of NTX is that it is a small cyclic molecule that contains a disulfide bond. In spite of its size, it acts as an antagonist at insect and mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The functional importance of the disulfide bond was assessed by determining the effects of inserting a methylene group between the two sulfur atoms, creating dimethylaminodithiane (DMA-DT). We also assessed the effect of methylating the NTX and DMA-DT dimethylamino groups on binding to three vertebrate nAChRs. Radioligand receptor binding experiments were carried out using washed membranes from rat brain and fish (Torpedo) electric organ; [H-3]-cytisine displacement was used to assess binding to the predominantly high affinity alpha4beta2 nAChRs and [I-125]-alpha-bungarotoxin displacement was used to measure binding of NTX and analogs to the alpha7 and skeletal muscle type nAChRs. While the two quaternary nitrogen analogs, relative to their respective tertiary amines, displayed lower alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR binding affinities, both displayed much higher affinities for the Torpedo muscle nAChR and rat alpha7 brain receptors than their respective tertiary amine forms. The binding affinities of DMA-DT for the three nAChRs were lower than those of NTX and MeNTX. An AChBP mutant lacking the C loop disulfide bond that would potentially react with the NTX disulfide bond displayed an NTX affinity very similar to the parent AChBP. Inhibition of [H-3]-epibatidine binding to the AChBPs was not affected by exposure to NTX or MeNTX for up to 24 hr prior to addition of the radioligand. Thus, the disulfide bond of NTX is not required to react with the vicinal disulfide in the AChBP C loop for inhibition of [H-3]-epibatidine binding. However, a reversible disulfide interchange reaction of NTX with nAChRs might still occur, especially under reducing conditions. Labeled MeNTX, because it can be readily prepared with high specific radioactivity and possesses relatively high affinity for the nAChR-rich Torpedo nAChR, would be a useful probe to detect and identify any nereistoxin adducts.

Prediction of response and survival after standardized treatment with 7400 MBq <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-PSMA-617 every 4 weeks in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						PSMA-RLT; mCRPC; Response prediction; Survival prediction; PSA	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; PSMA; CHEMOTHERAPY; ANTIGEN	Background and aims [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) is a new therapy for patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, identification of reliable prognostic factors is hampered by heterogeneous treatment regimens applied in previous studies. Hence, we sought clinical factors able to predict response and survival to PSMA-RLT in a homogenous group of patients, all receiving 7400 MBq every 4 weeks. Patients and methods Data of 61 patients (mean age 71.6 +/- 6.9 years, median basal PSA 70.7 [range 1.0-4890 mu g/L]), pretreated with abiraterone/enzalutamide (75.4%) and docetaxel/cabazitaxel (68.9%), received three cycles of PSMA-RLT (mean 7321 +/- 592 MBq) at four weekly intervals and were analyzed retrospectively. General medical conditions and laboratory parameters of every patients were regularly assessed. Response to therapy was based on PSA levels 1 month after the 3rd cycle. Binary logistic regression test and Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to evaluate predictors and overall survival (OS). Results Forty-nine (80.3%) patients demonstrated a therapy response in terms of any PSA decline, while 21 (19.7%) patients showed increase or no changes in their PSA levels. Baseline hemoglobin (Hb) significantly predicted PSA reductions of >= 50% 4 weeks after receiving the 3rd PSMA-RLT (P = 0.01, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09) with an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.54-0.81). The levels of basal Hb and basal PSA were able to predict survival of patients, both P < 0.05 (relative risk 1.51 and 0.79, 95% CI: 1.09-2.09 and 0.43-1.46), respectively. In comparison to patients with reduced basal Hb, patients with normal basal Hb levels lived significantly longer (median survival not reached vs. 89 weeks, P = 0.016). Also, patients with basal PSA levels <= 650 mu g/L had a significantly longer survival than patients with basal PSA levels > 650 mu g/L (median survival not reached vs. 97 weeks, P = 0.031). Neither pretreatments with abiraterone/enzalutamide or docetaxel/cabazitaxel nor distribution of metastasis affected survival and rate of response to PSMA-RLT. Conclusion Basal Hb level is an independent predictor for therapy response and survival in patients receiving PSMA-RLT every 4 weeks. Both baseline PSA <= 650 mu g/L and normal Hb levels were associated with longer survival.

Hence, this receptor is a promising target for diagnostic imaging and radioligand therapy. Using the favorable biodistribution data of the NTR1-targeting agent In-111-3BP-227, we investigated the therapeutic effect of its Lu-177-labeled analog on the tumor growth of NTR1-positive HT29 colon carcinoma xenografts. Methods: 3BP-227 was labeled with Lu-177. To assess its biodistribution properties, SPECT and CT scans of HT29-xenografted nude mice injected with Lu-177-3BP-227 were acquired, and ex vivo tissue activity was determined. To evaluate therapeutic efficacy, 2 groups of mice received the radiopharmaceutical in a median dose of either 165 MBq (129-232 MBq, n = 10) or 110 MBq (82-116 MBq, n = 10), whereas control mice were injected with vehicle ( n = 10). Tumor sizes and body weights were monitored for up to 49 d. Renal function and histologic morphology were evaluated. Results: Whole-body SPECT/CT images allowed clear tumor visualization with low background activity and high tumor-to-kidney and -liver ratios. Ex vivo biodistribution data confirmed high and persistent uptake of Lu-177-3BP-227 in HT29 tumors (19.0 +/- 3.6 vs. 2.7 +/- 1.6 percentage injected dose per gram at 3 and 69 h after injection, respectively). The application of Lu-177- 3BP- 227 resulted in a distinct delay of tumor growth. Median tumor doubling time for controls was 5.5 d (interquartile range [IQR], 2.8-7.0), compared with 17.5 d (IQR, 5.5-22.5 d) for the 110-MBq and 41.0 d (IQR, 27.5-55.0) for the 165-MBg group. Compared with controls, median relative tumor volume at day 23 after injection was reduced by 55% (P = 0.034) in the 110-MBq and by 88% (P < 0.01) in the 165-MBq group. Renal histology and clinical chemistry results did not differ between radiotherapy groups and controls, suggesting absence of therapy-induced acute renal damage. Conclusion: These data demonstrate that the novel NTR1- targeting theranostic agent 3BP-227 is an effective and promising candidate for radioligand therapy, with a favorable preliminary safety profile and high potential for clinical translation.

Mixed-Affinity Binding in Humans with 18-kDa Translocator Protein Ligands	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						TSPO; mixed-affinity binding; radioligand binding	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; HUMAN BRAIN; PET; RADIOLIGAND	C-11-PBR28 PET can detect the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) expressed within macrophages. However, quantitative evaluation of the signal in brain tissue from donors with multiple sclerosis (MS) shows that PBR28 binds the TSPO with high affinity (binding affinity [K-i], similar to 4 nM), low affinity (K-i, similar to 200 nM), or mixed affinity (2 sites with K-i, similar to 4 nM and similar to 300 nM). Our study tested whether similar binding behavior could be detected in brain tissue from donors with no history of neurologic disease, with TSPO-binding PET ligands other than C-11-PBR28, for TSPO present in peripheral blood, and with human brain PET data acquired in vivo with C-11-PBR28. Methods: The affinity of TSPO ligands was measured in the human brain post-mortem from donors with a history of MS (n = 13), donors without any history of neurologic disease (n = 20), and in platelets from healthy volunteers (n = 3). Binding potential estimates from thirty-five C-11-PBR28 PET scans from an independent sample of healthy volunteers were analyzed using a gaussian mixture model. Results: Three binding affinity patterns were found in brains from subjects without neurologic disease in similar proportions to those reported previously from studies of MS brains. TSPO ligands showed substantial differences in affinity between subjects classified as high-affinity binders (HABs) and low-affinity binders (LABs). Differences in affinity between HABs and LABs are approximately 50-fold with PBR28, approximately 17-fold with PBR06, and approximately 4-fold with DAA1106, DPA713, and PBR111. Where differences in affinity between HABs and LABs were low (similar to 4-fold), distinct affinities were not resolvable in binding curves for mixed-affinity binders (MABs), which appeared to express 1 class of sites with an affinity approximately equal to the mean of those for HABs and LABs. Mixed-affinity binding was detected in platelets from an independent sample (HAB, 69%; MAB, 31%), although LABs were not detected. Analysis of C-11-PBR28 PET data was not inconsistent with the existence of distinct subpopulations of HABs, MABs, and LABs. Conclusion: With the exception of C-11-PK11195, all TSPO PET ligands in current clinical application recognize HABs, LABs, and MABs in brain tissue in vitro. Knowledge of subjects' binding patterns will be required to accurately quantify TSPO expression in vivo using PET.	[Owen, David R.

Metabotropic Glutamate Subtype 5 Receptors Are Quantified in the Human Brain with a Novel Radioligand for PET	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						molecular imaging; glutamate neurotransmission; PET	IN-VITRO; RADIOTRACERS; C-11-ABP688; TOMOGRAPHY; BINDING; LIGANDS	We developed a radioligand, 3-fluoro-5-(2-(2-F-18-(fluoromethyl)thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)benzonitrile (F-18-SP203), for metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 (mGluR5) receptors that showed both promising (high specific binding) and problematic (defluorination) imaging characteristics in animals. The purposes of this initial evaluation in human subjects were to determine whether F-18-SP203 is defluorinated in vivo (as measured by uptake of radioactivity in the skull) and to determine whether the uptake in the brain can be quantified as distribution volume relative to concentrations of F-18-SP203 in plasma. Methods: Seven healthy subjects were injected with F-18-SP203 (323 +/- 87 MBq) and scanned over 5h, with rest periods outside the camera. The concentrations of F-18-SP203, separated from radiometabolites, were measured in arterial plasma. Results: The skull was difficult to visualize on PET images in the initial 2 h, because of high radioactivity in the brain. Although radioactivity in the skull and adjacent cortex showed some cross-contamination, the concentration of radioactivity in the skull was less than half of that in the adjacent cortex during the initial 2 h. Modeling of regional brain and plasma data showed that a 2-tissue-compartment model was superior to a 1-tissue-compartment model, consistent with measurable amounts of both receptor-specific and nonspecific binding. The concentrations of activity in the brain measured with PET were consistently greater than the modeled values at late but not early time points and may well have been caused by the slow accumulation of radiometabolites in the brain. To determine an adequate time for more accurate measurement of distribution volume, we selected a scan duration (i.e., 2 h) associated with maximal or near-maximal identifiability. Distribution volume was well identified (similar to 2%) by only 2 h (and even just 1) of image acquisition. Conclusion: This initial evaluation of F-18-SP203 in healthy human subjects showed that defluorination is relatively small and that brain uptake can be robustly calculated as distribution volume. The values of distribution volume were well identified and had relatively small variation in this group of 7 subjects. These results suggest that F-18-SP203 will have good sensitivity to measure mGluR5 receptors for both within-subject studies (e.g., receptor occupancy) and between-subject studies (e.g., patients vs. healthy subjects).

(Amaranthaceae) and Brugmansia arborea (L.) Lagerheim (Solanaceae) are used in the northern Peruvian Andes for magic-therapeutical purposes. The traditional healers use Iresine herbstii with the ritual aim to expel bad spirits from the body. Furthermore, Iresine herbstii was used in association with other plants, such as Trichocereus pachanoi Britt. et Rose, for divination, to diagnose diseases, and to take possession of another identity. Also, species of Brugmansia have been reported to be used during ritual practices for magical and curative purposes. Given the above evidence, the aim of the present study is to evaluate if the central effects of Iresine herbstii and Brugmansia arborea could be associated with interaction with SNC receptors. Two Iresine herbstii extracts (methanolic and aqueous) and one Brugmansia arborea aqueous extract were tested for in vitro affinity on 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, D1, D2, alpha(1), and alpha(2) receptors by radioligand binding assays. The biological materials for binding assay (cerebral cortex) were taken from male Sprague-Dawley rats. The extracts affinity for receptors is definite as inhibition percentage of racholigand/receptor binding and measured as the radioactivity of remaining complex radioligand/receptor. The data obtained for Iresine extracts have shown a low affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and no affinity for 5-HT2A receptor. Otherwise the methanolic extract showed affinity for 5-HT2C receptor (IC50: 34.78 mu g/ml) and for D1 receptor (IC50: 19.63 mu g/ml), instead the Iresine aqueous extract displayed a lower affinity for D1 (48.3% at the maximum concentration tested) and a higher value of affinity for D2 receptors (IC50: 32.08 mu g/ml). The Brugmansia aqueous extract displayed affinity for DI receptors (IC50: 17.68 mu g/ml), D2 receptors (IC50: 15.95 mu g/ml) and weak affinity for the serotoninergic receptors. None of the three extracts showed relevant affinity to the alpha 1, and alpha 2 receptors. The results of our experiments indicate that Iresine herbstii methanolic extract was able to interact with the central 5-HT2C and D I receptors and Iresine herbstii aqueous extract showed affinity for D2 receptors, thus confirming their ritual use. Instead Brugmansia arborea was able to interact only with the central dopamine receptors tested. Parallel studies are currently in progress for evaluating the extracts affinity and active components towards these and other receptor types (GABAergic). (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

We investigated whether residues C-terminal of position 14 in PTH(1-34) contribute to the J component of the interaction mechanism by comparing the capacity of PTH analogues N-terminally modified to improve J domain affinity and C-terminally truncated at position 14, 20, or 34 to stimulate cAMP formation in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with PIR-delNt, a PIR construct that lacks most of the N domain. In these cells, the potency of [M]PTH(1-34) (M = Ala(1,3,12),-Gln(10),Har(11),Trp(14),Arg(19)) was 120-fold greater than that of [M]PTH(1-14) (EC(50)s = 3.0 +/- 0.8 and 360 +/- 90 nM, respectively) but was equal to that of [M]PTH(1-20) (EC50 = 2.3 +/- 0.3 nM). Reverting the Arg19 substitution of [M]PTH(1-20) to the native Glu reduced cAMP signaling potency on PIR-delNt by 12-fold (EC50 of [M]PTH(1-20)-Glu(19) = 27 +/- 4 nM), and it decreased the analog's capacity to inhibit the binding of the J domain-selective radioligand, I-125-[Aib(1.3),Nle(8),M,Tyr(21)]ratPTH(1-21), to the full-length PIR stably expressed in LLC-PK1 cells by 40-fold. The Glu(19) --> Arg modification, however, did not affect the capacity of PTH(15-31) to inhibit the binding of the N domain-selective radioligand I-125-bPTH(3-34) to the full-length receptor. The overall data suggest that residues (15-20) of PTH, and particularly residue 19, contribute to the capacity of the N-terminal portion of the ligand to interact with the juxtamembrane region of the receptor. The NMR data presented in the accompanying, manuscript suggests that this role could involve intramolecular effects on secondary structure in the N-terminal portion of the ligand.

J	Hoare, SRJ; Gardella, TJ; Usdin, TB				Hoare, SRJ; Gardella, TJ; Usdin, TB			Evaluating the signal transduction mechanism of the parathyroid hormone 1 receptor - Effect of receptor-G-protein interaction on the ligand binding mechanism and receptor conformation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							(PTH)/PTH-RELATED PEPTIDE RECEPTOR; FIRST EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; PTH/PTHRP RECEPTOR; CHIMERIC RECEPTORS; GUANINE-NUCLEOTIDE; TERMINAL REGION; KIDNEY-CELLS; AFFINITY; AGONIST	Ligand binding to the PTH1 receptor is described by a "two-site" model, in which the C-terminal portion of the ligand interacts with the N-terminal domain of the receptor (N interaction), and the N-terminal region of the ligand binds the juxtamembrane domain of the receptor (J interaction). Previous studies have not considered the dynamic nature of receptor conformation in ligand binding and receptor activation. In this study the ligand binding mechanism was compared for the G-protein-coupled (RG) and uncoupled (R) PTH1 receptor conformations. The two site model was confirmed by demonstration of spatially distinct binding sites for PTH(3-34) and PTH(1-14): PTH(1-11), which binds predominantly to the J domain, only partially inhibited binding of I-125-PTH(3-34); and PTH(3-34), shown to bind predominantly to the N domain, only partially inhibited PTH(1-14)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. To assess the effect of R-G coupling, ligand binding to R was measured by displacement of I-125-PTH(3-34) with 30 muM guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gammaS) present, and binding to RG was measured by displacement of I-125-[MAP]PTHrP(1-36) (where MAP is model amphipathic peptide), a new radioligand that binds selectively to RG. Agonists bound with higher affinity to RG than R, whereas antagonists bound similarly to these states. The J interaction was responsible for enhanced agonist binding to RG: residues 1 and 2 were required for increased PTB(1-34) affinity for RG; residue 5 of MAP-PTHrP(1-36) was a determinant of R/RG binding selectivity, and PTH(1-14) bound selectively to RG. The N interaction was insensitive to R-G coupling; PTH(3-34) binding was GTP gammaS-insensitive. Finally, several observations suggest the receptor conformation is more "closed" at RG than R. At the R state, an open conformation is suggested by the simultaneous binding of PTH(1-14) and PTH(3-34). At RG PTH(1-14) better occluded binding of I-125-PTH(3-34) and agonist ligands bound pseudo-irreversibly, suggesting a more closed conformation of this receptor state. The results extend the two-site model to take into account R and RG conformations and suggest a model for differences of receptor conformation between these states.

Whereas several therapeutic programs targeting mHTT expression have advanced to clinical evaluation, methods to visualize mHTT protein species in the living brain are lacking. Here, we demonstrate the development and characterization of a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging radioligand with high affinity and selectivity for mHTT aggregates. This small molecule radiolabeled with C-11 ([C-11]CHDI-180R) allowed noninvasive monitoring of mHTT pathology in the brain and could track region- and time-dependent suppression of mHTT in response to therapeutic interventions targeting mHTT expression in a rodent model. We further showed that in these animals, therapeutic agents that lowered mHTT in the striatum had a functional restorative effect that could be measured by preservation of striatal imaging markers, enabling a translational path to assess the functional effect of mHTT lowering.

Eligible patients were offered salvage radiopharmaceutical therapy with the novel NTR1 antagonist Lu-177-3BP- 227. Methods: Six patients with confirmed ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had exhausted all other treatment options received Lu-177-3BP-227 for evaluation of NTR1 expression in vivo. Three patients received treatment activities of 5.1-7.5 GBq. Results: Administration of Lu-177-3BP-227 was well tolerated by all patients. The kidneys were identified as the dose-limiting organ. The most severe adverse event was reversible grade 2 anemia. One patient achieved a partial response and experienced significant improvement of symptoms and quality of life.

All analogues were subjected to competition radioligand binding assays at human oxytocin (OT) and arginine vasopressin 1a (V-1a) receptors. Physiological activity was determined using whole cell IP1 accumulation assays. Under these conditions, WAY -267,464 had higher affinity for the V-1a receptor compared to the OT receptor (8.5x more selective) with poor functional selectivity (2x selective for OT receptor agonism over V-1a receptor antagonism). Methylation of the resorcinol moiety (3) reversed the OT receptor pharmacological profile, removing agonist activity and inducing antagonist activity, without altering V-1a receptor pharmacology. All flexible tethered derivatives removed OT receptor affinity and activity resulting in the generation of highly selective V-1a receptor ligands. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Owing to their specific accumulation in tumour tissue, porphyrins, metalloporphyrins and chlorins have been used as in photodynamic therapy and optical imaging. Moreover, their specific uptake into inflammatory atheromatous plaques via LDL endocytosis has been reported. The present study is concerned with the synthesis of Ga-68 labelled porphyrin derivatives and an in vitro assessment of the utility of radiotracers in positron emission tomography. A set of five porphyrin derivatives were labelled using Ga-68 from a commercially obtained radionuclide generator. Dedicated post-processing of the generator eluate was conducted to allow for labelling in aqueous media and also under anhydrous conditions. Challenge studies and incubation in human serum confirmed the stability of the tracers. Plasma protein binding was investigated in order to confirm the presence of freely diffusible radioligand in plasma. A preliminary microPET study in a tumour-bearing rat resulted in a clear visualisation of the tumour. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Furthermore, autoradiography for [I-125]8 displayed intense and specific labeling of A beta plaques in the brain sections mentioned above with low background. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice [I-125]8 showed high initial brain uptake followed by rapid washout (4.27 and 0.64% ID/g at 2 and 30 min post injection, respectively). These findings suggests that [I-123]8 may be a potential SPECT imaging agent for detecting A beta plaques in AD brain.

Methods The aqueous extracts of bulbs or leaves of Allium sativum L. (garlic), Allium neapolitanum Cyr., Allium subhirsutum L., and Allium roseum L. were tested for their in vitro affinity for the adrenergic (alpha(1), alpha(2), beta(1) and beta(2)) and dopaminergic (D-1 and D-2) receptors by radioligand binding assays. Results Interesting results were shown by bulbs extracts of A. neapolitanum and A. subhirsutum with higher affinities for the beta(2) receptors and by bulbs extract of A. roseum for D-2 receptors. Conclusions The known antihypertensive activity of Allium sativum cannot be correlated with binding to receptors involved in blood pressure regulation. However, aqueous extracts of the wild-type species of Allium show much higher affinities, warranting further explorations.

Mouse B lymphocytes contained 12,200 3200 of epibatidine-binding sites and 3130 750 of alpha-Bungarotoxin-binding sites per cell. Mice lacking nicotinic receptor subunits alpha 4, beta 2 or alpha 7 had less serum IgG and IgG-producing cells in the spleen, but showed stronger immune response to both protein antigen in vivo and CD40-specific antibody in vitro than wild-type mice. Anti-CD40-stimulated proliferation of B lymphocytes from beta 2 knockout, but not wild-type mice was inhibited with nicotine. Our results indicate that signalling through nicotinic receptors affects both the pre-immune state and activation of B lymphocytes in the immune response, possibly via CD40-dependent pathway. This could contribute to immune depression found in tobacco smokers. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we report on the formation of radioactive impurities formed during the clinical production of Lu-177-labeled PSMA-617. We provide compelling evidence that these impurities are the result of a spontaneous, thermally mediated condensation reaction of the Glu-CO-Lys moiety resulting in the formation of three different five-membered ring systems. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that the condensation and cyclization of the Glu-CO-Lys moiety is thermodynamically spontaneous. In cell experiments, no affinity of these cyclized compounds toward PSMA was observed. HPLC analyses of urine samples from patient studies showed rapid renal excretion of these radioactive cyclized species. Radiolabeling conditions were identified that significantly reduced the formation of cyclized side products yielding Lu-177-labeled PSMA-617 in high radiochemical yield and purity in concordance with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) requirements.

Over the past 2 decades, significant advances toward developing drugs and positron emission tomography (PET) tracers targeting different components of the ECS have been made. Herein, we summarized the recent development of PET tracers for imaging cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1R) and 2 (CB2R) as well as the key enzymes monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), particularly focusing on PET neuroimaging applications. State-of-the-art PET tracers for the ECS will be reviewed including their chemical design, pharmacological properties, radiolabeling, as well as preclinical and human PET imaging. In addition, this review addresses the current challenges for ECS PET biomarker development and highlights the important role of PET ligands to study disease pathophysiology as well as to facilitate drug discovery.

Detailed assessment of features contributing to GPCR ligand engagement in a physiologically relevant environment is imperative to the development of new therapeutics with improved efficacy. Traditionally, binding properties such as affinity and kinetics were obtained using biochemical radioligand binding assays. More recently, the high specificity of resonance energy transfer has been leveraged toward the development of homogeneous cell-based proximity assays with capacity for real-time kinetic measurements. This suite of ligand binding protocols couples the specificity of bioluminescent resonance energy transfer (BRET) with the sensitivity afforded by the luminescent HiBiT peptide. The BRET format is used to quantify dynamic interactions between ligands and their cognate HiBiT-tagged GPCRs through competitive binding with fluorescent Tracers. At the same time, high affinity complementation of HiBiT with the cell impermeable LgBiT limits the bright bioluminescence donor signal to the cell surface and eliminates luminescence background from unoccupied receptors present in intracellular compartments.

Pyrrolone Derivatives as Intracellular Allosteric Modulators for Chemokine Receptors: Selective and Dual-Targeting Inhibitors of CC Chemokine Receptors 1 and 2	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ORALLY-ACTIVE ANTAGONIST; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; HIV ENTRY; POTENT; CELLS; ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; INFLAMMATION; ACTIVATION; DISCOVERY; IMMUNITY	The recent crystal structures of CC chemokine receptors 2 and 9 (CCR2 and CCR9) have provided structural evidence for an allosteric, intracellular binding site. The high conservation of residues involved in this site suggests its presence in most chemokine receptors, including the close homologue CCR1. By using [H-3]CCR2-RA-[R], a high-affinity, CCR2 intracellular ligand, we report an intracellular binding site in CCR1, where this radioligand also binds with high affinity. In addition, we report the synthesis and biological characterization of a series of pyrrolone derivatives for CCR1 and CCR2, which allowed us to identify several high-affinity intracellular ligands, including selective and potential multitarget antagonists. Evaluation of selected compounds in a functional [S-35]GTP gamma S assay revealed that they act as inverse agonists in CCR1, providing a new manner of pharmacological modulation. Thus, this intracellular binding site enables the design of selective and multitarget inhibitors as a novel therapeutic approach.	[Zacarias, Natalia V. Ortiz; van Veldhoven, Jacobus P.

The water solubility of the dithiocarbamate iniferter was achieved by incorporating two unprotected glucose units into the iniferter structure by copper(I)-catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition ("click chemistry'). Molecularly imprinted nano particles (MIPs) specific for 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the corresponding non-imprinted particles (NIPs) were prepared in pure water by using the prepared iniferter as photoinitiator. Radioligand binding tests confirmed a high imprinting factor, and the living character of the iniferter was demonstrated by re-initiating a second photochemical polymerisation on the NIP nanoparticles in water by using ethylene glycol methacrylate phosphate. Our newly synthesised structure is a promising tool for iniferter-mediated photopolymerisations in aqueous media for the preparation of biocompatible nanomaterials with high potential for biomedical applications in a bottom-up fashion.

J	Harder, D; Fotiadis, D				Harder, Daniel; Fotiadis, Dimitrios			Measuring substrate binding and affinity of purified membrane transport proteins using the scintillation proximity assay	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							ANTIBODY-CAPTURE; RECEPTOR; LEUT; DETERGENTS; ACTIVATION; SYMPORTER; MECHANISM; REVEALS	The scintillation proximity assay (SPA) is a rapid radioligand binding assay. Upon binding of radioactively labeled ligands (here L-[H-3] arginine or D-[H-3]glucose) to acceptor proteins immobilized on fluoromicrospheres (containing the scintillant), a light signal is stimulated and measured. The application of SPA to purified, detergent-solubilized membrane transport proteins allows substrate-binding properties to be assessed (e.g., substrate specificity and affinity), usually within 1 d. Notably, the SPA makes it possible to study specific transporters without interference from other cellular components, such as endogenous transporters. Reconstitution of the target transporter into proteoliposomes is not required. The SPA procedure allows high sample throughput and simple sample handling without the need for washing or separation steps: components are mixed in one well and the signal is measured directly after incubation. Therefore, the SPA is an excellent tool for high-throughput screening experiments, e.g., to search for substrates and inhibitors, and it has also recently become an attractive tool for drug discovery.

The biodistribution in mice shows that 99mTc-HEIDP has high specificity and efficacy in bone and joint uptake with 5.73 and 9.93%ID/g at 5 min, which increases continuously to a maximum of 7.62 and 18.0%ID/g at 30 min, respectively. Kinetics of blood clearance showed that distribution half-life (T1/2 alpha) and elimination half-life (T1/2 beta) of 99mTc-HEIDP were 9.91 and 81.1 min, respectively. The total clearance rate was 1.94%ID/gmin-1. A plain and clear bone image was obtained at 1h by using single photon emission computed tomography.

Structure-activity relationships revealed the binding of dibenzylideneacetones to be affected by various substituents. The introduction of a substituent group in the ortho position reduced or abolished the binding. However, the para position was highly tolerant of sterically demanding substitutions. Three radioiodinated ligands (6, 70, and 71) and two F-18 fluoro-pegylated (FPEG) ligands (83 and 85) were prepared, all of which displayed high affinity folr A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i ranging from 0.9 to 7.0 nM). In biodistribution experiments, they exhibited good initial penetration (1.59, 4.68, 4.56, 4.13, and 5.15% ID/g, respectively, at 2 min) of and fast clearance from the brain. Autoradiography with sections of postmortem AD brain and transgenic mouse brain confirmed the high affinity of these tracers. These preliminary results strongly suggest the dibenzylideneacetone structure to be a potential new scaffold for beta-amyloid imaging probes.

Despite different triggering, emerging evidence indicates that neuroinflammation revealed through microglia activation is critical for PD. Moreover, recent investigations sought a potential relationship between Lrrk2 genetic mutation and microglia activation. In this paper, neuroinflammation in sporadic PD, Lrrk2-PD and unaffected Lrrk2 mutation carriers were investigated. The principal component analysis (PCA) and the subject's residual profile (SRP) techniques were performed on multiple groups and regions of interest in 22 brain-regions. The C-11-PBR28 binding profiles were compared in four genotypes depending on groups, i.e., HC, sPD, Lrrk2-PD and UC, using the PCA and SPR scores. The genotype effect was found as a principal feature of group-dependent C-11-PBR28 binding, and preliminary evidence of a MAB-Lrrk2 mutation interaction in manifest Parkinson's and subjects at risk was found.

However, GHB's mechanism of action remains to be uncovered. Within the CNS, GHB targets both GABA(B)receptors and a pharmacologically distinct population of high-affinity binding sites with unknown molecular identity. HOCPCA (3-hydroxycyclopent-1-enecarboxylic acid) is a structural analog of GHB selectively targeting GHB high-affinity binding sites. Here, we discuss the usefulness of(3)H- and(11)C-labeled HOCPCA as radioligands for selectively probing GHB high-affinity binding sites and their application in drug discovery. As such, [H-3]HOCPCA's exceptional affinity and selectivity makes it an indispensable tool in drug discovery, and its utility has been demonstrated in, for example, homogenate binding studies,in vitroas well asex vivoautoradiography. Moreover, the successful synthesis of [C-11]HOCPCA is a starting point for further ligand development for futurein vivoinvestigations of GHB high-affinity binding sites.

Their binding affinities were evaluated in vitro, and the most promising candidate (Z)-16 exhibited a K-i of 5.7 nM and a clogP value of 2.3. The synthesis of the precursor tosylate (E)-22 revealed a preference for the (E)-configurational isomer (K-i = 31.2 nM), and successful radiosynthesis afforded (E)-[F-18]-16 which was used as a model PET tracer to establish plasma and PBS stability. (E)-[F-18]-16 (K-d = 70 nM) exhibited excellent specificity for mGluRS in autoradiographic studies on horizontal rat brain slices in vitro.

Screening of their ligands is mainly based on assays of ligand binding to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of hPPARs. However, such assays are difficult because of the preparation of hPPARs LBD. In order to yield functional hPPARs LBD for screening ligands, hPPARs LBD was fused with maltose-binding protein (MBP) using the pMAL-p2x expression system through the gene engineering technique. The radioligand binding assay showed that MBP did not affect ligand binding with hPPARs LBD in the fusion proteins, which means that MBP-hPPARs LBD can be used instead of hPPARs LBD in ligand screening work. The results show that the new strategy using MBP as a fusion tag for preparing hPPARs LBD for screening ligands is a convenient and reliable method. It may be used to easily obtain the other nuclear receptors.

The in vitro potency of these antagonists was determined by displacement of the glycine site radioligand [H-3]-5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid ([H-3]DCKA) in rat brain cortical membranes. Structure-activity relationship studies indicate that a cyano group is a good replacement for the nitro group in the 5-position of licostinel while 5-carboxy, 5-ester, 5-ketone and 5-amide derivatives showed reduced potency. 5,6-Cyclized analogues of licostinel also showed significantly reduced potency. Among the trisubstituted QXs investigated, 5-cyano-6,7-dichloro QX and 5-cyano-7-chloro-6-methyl QX are the most potent with IC50 values of 32 nM and 26 nM, respectively.

METHODS: Before and after the treatment with diltiazem in CHF patients, lymphocyte beta-AR density was measured with [H-3]dihydroalprenolol radioligand binding assay, levels of free cytosolic calcium ([Ca2+](i)) in platelets were estimated with fluorescent indicator Fura 2-AM, plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were measured with I-125-radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Lymphocyte beta-AR density was lower and [Ca2+](i) in platelets was significantly higher in CHF patients than those in control. Plasma NE levels were higher in CHF patients than those in control. Diltiazem therapy reduced [Ca2+](i) in platelets and increased lymphocyte beta-AR density in CHF patients without significant change of plasma NE concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Diltiazem partly reversed down-regulation of lymphocyte beta-AR density in CHF patients, and this effect was not related to the level of plasma NE, and might be attributed to intracellular [Ca2+](i) decrease.

J	Jadvar, H				Jadvar, Hossein			The VISION Forward: Recognition and Implication of PSMA2/<SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG1 mCRPC	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate; cancer; PSMA; FDG; VISION	PROSTATE-CANCER; EXPRESSION	Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is incurable. The expression of the transmembrane protein prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is markedly increased in most mCRPC lesions. PSMA has been recognized as a viable biologic target for imaging and radionuclide therapy (theranostics) in mCRPC. The PET agents Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-DCFPyL have recently been approved for imaging evaluation of patients with suspected metastasis who are candidates for initial definitive therapy and patients with suspected recurrence based on elevated serumprostate-specific antigen level. Radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177-PSMA-617 (Lu-177-vipivotide tetraxetan, Pluvicto, Novartis/AAA) was approved on March 23, 2022, based on the favorable results of the VISION trial. It has been recognized that PET imaging of PSMA expression and glucose metabolism (with F-18-FDG) provides a more comprehensive assessment of the tumor burden and heterogeneity. However, there are many unresolved issues that surround whether or not imaging with F-18-FDG PET is advantageous in the clinical setting of PSMA RLT in mCRPR.

A conserved aspartate in transmembrane segment (TM) II of M2R, D69, has been proposed as the voltage sensor. While a recent paper instead presented evidence of tyrosines in TMs III, VI, and VII acting as voltage sensors, these authors were not able to record GIRK channel activation by a D69N mutant M2R. In the present study, we succeeded in recording ACh-induced GIRK channel activation by this mutant at -80 and 0 mV. The acetylcholine EC50 was about 2.5-fold higher at 0 mV, a potency shift very similar to that observed at wild-type M2R, indicating that voltage sensitivity persists at the D69N mutant. Thus, our present observations corroborate the notion that D69 is not responsible for voltage sensitivity of the M2R. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We have developed and validated binary classification QSAR models capable of predicting potential 5-HT2B actives. The classification accuracies of the models built to discriminate 5-HT2B actives from the inactives were as high as 80% for the external test set. These models were used to screen in silico 59 000 compounds included in the World Drug Index, and 122 compounds were predicted as actives with high confidence. Ten of them were tested in radioligand binding assays and nine were found active, suggesting a success rate of 90%. All validated actives were then tested in functional assays, and one compound was identified as a true 5-HT2B agonist. We suggest that the QSAR models developed in this study could be used as reliable predictors to flag drug candidates that are likely to cause valvulopathy.

The Lewis acid-catalysed reactions of (20R)-3 beta-acetoxy-21-azidomethyl-20-hydroxypregn-5-ene with substituted aromatic aldehydes led to the formation of 3 beta-acetoxyandrost-5-enes substituted in position 17 beta with oxazolinyl residues (7a-g). Oppenauer oxidation of the 3 beta-hydroxy-exo-heterocyclic steroids yielded the corresponding Delta(4)-3-ketosteroids. The inhibitory effects (IC50) of both 3-hydroxy compounds 7a-g and their Delta(4)-3-keto counterparts 8a-g on rat testicular C-17,C-20-lyase were investigated with an in vitro radioligand incubation technique. The 3-chlorophenyl- (8d), and the 4-bromophenyl-17 beta-(2-oxazolin-5-yl)androst-4-en-3-one derivatives(8f) were found to be modest inhibitors (IC50=4.8 and 5.0 mu M, respectively).

Because conventional MS binding assays can only be carried out by LC-ESI-MS-MS, the use of the FlashQuant system substantially increases the throughput capacity of this method. The study was performed for mGAT1 as a model system. First, a method was developed to quantify NO 711 as a marker for mGAT1 in a range from 208 pm to 16.7 nM using [2H(10)]NO 711 as an internal standard. On this basis, MS binding assays for mGAT1 could be implemented. Affinity constants determined in both saturation and competition experiments were in excellent agreement with those obtained in MS binding assays based on LC-ESI-MS-MS quantification. As the MALDI-MS system takes only a few seconds for quantification per sample, and the whole assay procedure is executed in a 96-well format, this technique is amenable to high-throughput screening.

Isatin interaction with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a putative target of neuroprotective drugs: partial agonism with deprenyl	JOURNAL OF NEURAL TRANSMISSION-SUPPLEMENT			English	Article							MONOAMINE-OXIDASE INHIBITOR; VIRUS-RNA; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VIVO; APOPTOSIS; BINDING; PROTEIN; ENHANCEMENT; SELEGILINE; ENZYMES	There is evidence that the binding of deprenyl, a monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitor, and other propargylamines to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is primarily responsible for their neuroprotective and antiapoptotic effects. Thus, GAPDH may be a target for other neuroprotective drugs. Using two independent approaches, radioligand analysis and an optical biosensor technique, we demonstrate here that GAPDH also interact; with the endogenous, reversible MAO B inhibitor, isatin. Deprenyl inhibited both [H-3]isatin binding to GAPDH, and the binding of this enzyme to an isatin analogue, 5-aminoisatin, immobilized on to an optical biosensor ell. Another MAO inhibitor, tranylcypromine, was ineffective. Both deprenyl and isatin inhibited GAPDH-mediated cleavage of E. coli tRNA. and :heir effects were not additive. We suggest that isatin may be an endogenous partial functional agonist of deprenyl in its effect on GAPDH and GAPDH-mediated RNA cleavage. Changes in level of endogenous isatin may influence the neuroprotective effect of deprenyl in vivo.

Using an automated docking procedure, two B1 receptor antagonists of the dihydroquinoxalinone structural class were docked into the receptor model. Site-directed mutagenesis data of the amino acid residues in TM1, TM3, TM6, and TM7 were incorporated to place the compounds in the binding site of the homology model of the human B1 bradykinin receptor. The best pose in agreement with the mutation data was selected for detailed study of the receptor-antagonist interaction. To test the model, the calculated antagonist-receptor binding energy was correlated with the experimentally measured binding affinity (K-i) for nine dihydroquinoxalinone analogs. The model was used to gain insight into the molecular mechanism for receptor function and to optimize the dihydroquinoxalinone analogs. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The specific binding of the radioligand fulfills all the criteria for binding to a receptor site, being stable, reversible, saturable and of high affinity. 2-[I-125]-iodomelatonin labels a single class of sites in the sections of whole eyes as well as in isolated retinas with a similar affinity, whereas the total number of receptors was higher in sections of whole eyes than in isolated retinas. Melatonin and related analogues competed for 2-[I-125]-iodomelatonin binding with the following order of affinities: 2-iodomelatonin > 6-hydroxymelatonin > melatonin > 6-chloromelatonin > > > N-acetyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (NAS) > 5-methoxytryptamine > 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin). Micromolar concentrations of GTP and GDP dose-dependently and specifically inhibited agonist binding, suggesting coupling of the binding sites to a Gi protein. These results suggest the participation of melatonin in the regulation of retinal physiology trough activation of melatonin receptor subtypes.

Therefore, WARMTH decided to plan a multicenter retrospective analysis (the "617 trial") to evaluate response rate and OS as well as the impact of prior therapies on OS in more than 300 patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA-617. Materials and methods The data of 631 metastatic CRPC (mCRPC) patients from 11 different clinics were evaluated. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, all patients had to have received at least abiraterone or enzalutamide prior to [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy. The patients were divided into three groups: patients who had received prior chemotherapy, patients who avoided chemotherapy, and patients for whom a chemotherapy was contraindicated. Results The analysis included the data of 416 patients, with a median age of 71.9 years. At the time of analysis, 87 patients (20,9%) were still alive. A total of 53.6% of patients had received both abiraterone and enzalutamide; 75.5% and 26.4% had a history of chemotherapy with docetaxel and cabazitaxel, respectively. A total of 20.4% had had Ra-223. The median OS was 11.1 months. Prior chemotherapy, the existence of bone and liver metastases, as well as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status, were significant prognosticators of worse overall survival in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients without any prior chemotherapy showed a significantly longer OS (14.6 months). The median OS in patients who received one or two lines of chemotherapy with docetaxel or docetaxel followed by cabazitaxel, respectively, was 10.9 months and 8.9 months. There was no difference in OS between patients who had not received chemotherapy and patients for whom chemotherapy was contraindicated. The other prior therapies did not have any significant impact on OS. Conclusion In the present multicenter analysis, chemotherapy-naive mCRPC patients receiving [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy had a significantly longer OS than patients with a history of chemotherapy. This remained independent in the multivariate analysis besides presence of bone and liver metastases as negative prognosticators for survival, whereas an ECOG of 0-1 is associated with a longer OS.

The pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine acetamides are a particularly attractive class of TSPO-specific ligands, prompting the development of several positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers. This includes F-DPA, a recently reported fluorinated ligand (K (i) = 1.7 nM), wherein the fluorine atom is directly linked to the phenyl moiety without the presence of an alkyl or alkoxy spacer chain. Reported here is the preparation of [F-18]F-DPA using [F-18]Selectfluor bis(triflate) and the preliminary evaluation of [F-18]F-DPA in healthy rats. Its metabolic profile and biodistribution in rats are compared with that of [F-18]DPA-714, a closely related structure. [F-18]F-DPA was synthesized by electrophilic fluorination using [F-18]Selectfluor bis(triflate), [F-18]DPA-714 was synthesized by conventional nucleophilic fluorination. The biodistribution of both radiotracers was compared in Sprague Dawley rats. Radiometabolites of both radiotracers in plasma and brain homogenates were analyzed by radioTLC. The radiochemical yield of [F-18]F-DPA was 15 +/- 3 % and the specific activity was 7.8 +/- 0.4 GBq/mu mol. The radiochemical purity exceeded 99 %. The in vivo time activity curves of [F-18]F-DPA demonstrate rapid entry into the brain and a concentration equilibrium at 20-30 min after injection. The metabolic profiles at 90 min after radiotracer injection in the plasma show that unchanged [F-18]F-DPA and [F-18]DPA-714 account for 28.3 +/- 6.4 and 11.1 +/- 2.6 % of the remaining radioactivity, respectively. In the brain, unchanged [F-18]F-DPA accounts for 93.5 +/- 2.8 % of the radioactivity; whereas for [F-18]DPA-714, this value is 53.6 +/- 1.6 %. [F-18]Selectfluor bis(triflate) was successfully used to label F-DPA with fluorine-18. The labeling position on the aromatic moiety imparts a higher stability compared to [F-18]DPA-714 with regard to in vivo metabolism. [F-18]F-DPA is a promising new radiotracer and warrants further investigation in animal models of disease.

This work aims to characterize the kinetic properties of an alpha(7)-nAChR-specific radioligand, 7-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-2-[F-18]-fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide ([F-18]DBT-10), in nonhuman primates. Methods [F-18]DBT-10 was produced via nucleophilic substitution of the nitro-precursor. Four Macaca mulatta subjects were imaged with [F-18]DBT-10 PET, with measurement of [F-18]DBT-10 parent concentrations and metabolism in arterial plasma. Baseline PET scans were acquired for all subjects. Following one scan, ex vivo analysis of brain tissue was performed to inspect for radiolabeled metabolites in brain. Three blocking scans with 0.69 and 1.24 mg/kg of the alpha(7)-nAChR-specific ligand ASEM were also acquired to assess dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]DBT-10 binding. Kinetic analysis of PET data was performed using the metabolite-corrected input function to calculate the parent fraction corrected total distribution volume (V (T)/f (P)). Results [F-18]DBT-10 was produced within 90 min at high specific activities of 428 +/- 436 GBq/mu mol at end of synthesis. Metabolism of [F-18]DBT-10 varied across subjects, stabilizing by 120 min post-injection at parent fractions of 15-55 %. Uptake of [F-18]DBT-10 in brain occurred rapidly, reaching peak standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 2.9-3.7 within 30 min. The plasma-free fraction was 18.8 +/- 3.4 %. No evidence for radiolabeled [F-18]DBT-10 metabolites was found in ex vivo brain tissue samples. Kinetic analysis of PET data was best described by the two-tissue compartment model. Estimated V (T)/f (P) values were 193-376 ml/cm(3) across regions, with regional rank order of thalamus > frontal cortex > striatum > hippocampus > occipital cortex > cerebellum > pons. Dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]DBT-10 binding by structural analog ASEM was observed throughout the brain, and occupancy plots yielded a V (ND)/f (P) estimate of 20 +/- 16 ml/cm(3). Conclusion These results demonstrate suitable kinetic properties of [F-18]DBT-10 for in vivo quantification of alpha(7)-nAChR binding in nonhuman primates.

Synthesis of Fentanyl Triazole Derivatives and their Affinity for Mu-Opioid and Sigma-1 Receptors	JOURNAL OF THE BRAZILIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						opioids; MOR; sigma-1 receptor; fentanyl; triazole ring	SCREENING LIBRARIES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; MORPHINE; PHARMACOLOGY; ANTAGONISTS; EFFICACY; BINDING	The search for compounds with affinity for both mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and sigma-1 receptor (sigma 1R) is one of the innovative directions to develop painkillers with reduced side effects. Additionally, triazole scaffolds have been extensively explored in the last two decades in medicinal chemistry. In this context, we synthesized a series of new triazole fentanyl derivatives and evaluated their affinity for both MOR and sigma 1R. The binding affinity of the compounds for human MOR was determined in competitive radioligand binding assays, using fentanyl as standard. For the assays with sigma 1R, a sigma 1R agonist (SKF10047) was employed. The most active analogue was 6d which moderately binds to MOR with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) = 1.9 mu M and to sigma 1R with IC50 = 6.9 mu M. Molecular docking calculations were carried out, providing a structural elucidation for the observed values of affinity. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion toxicity (ADMET) parameters for the new compounds were simulated with the SwissADME tool.

Human and mouse Urotensin II receptor overexpressing CHO cells were used for calcium release and radioligand binding assays. Initial molecules in this series had solubility and inter-species variability issue in the calcium release assay. We, therefore, conducted SAR to overcome these 2 issues and molecules with accepted in vitro profile were evaluated further in mouse pressor response model to generate the in vivo proof of concept for UII receptor antagonization.Results and conclusionsWe report herewith identification of 2-{N-[(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)acetyl]-N-methylamino}-3-pyrrolidinepropanamides series to obtain novel small molecule antagonists of Urotensin II receptor with acceptable pharmacological profile.

Herein, we developed the probe [F-18]PVBO for in vivo ER beta targeted PET imaging and obtained promising results. The nonradioactive PVBO showed a 12.5-fold stronger binding affinity to ER beta than to ER alpha in vitro. In vitro assays revealed the specific uptake of [F-18]PVBO by DU145 cells. The uptake of [F-18]PVBO by DU145 xenografts increased during the 120 min dynamic scanning, with a maximum uptake of 2.80 +/- 0.30% ID/g. Based on time activity curves (TACs), the injection of [F-18]PVBO with unlabeled PVBO or ERB041 resulted in a significant signal reduction with the tumor/muscle (T/M) ratio < 1 at 30, 60, 75, and 120 min post-injection (p < 0.05). [F-18]PVBO demonstrates the feasibility of noninvasively imaging ER beta-positive tumors by small-animal PET and provides a new strategy for visualizing ER beta in vivo.

However, there are potential indications beyond the ones covered by the S3 guideline on early detection, diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer in clinical care that might be helpful for patients. Objectives Since July 2018, an interdisciplinary group of experts from nuclear medicine, radiologists, radio-oncologists and urologists developed a consensus paper on state-of-the-art innovations in imaging diagnostics and radionuclide-based therapies for advanced prostate cancer. Conclusions Provided by the working group are suggestions and strategies to improve the implementation of new imaging techniques such as multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI), PSMA-PET/CT (prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography/computed tomography) and innovative therapeutic options (radium-223 dichloride, lutetium-177-PSMA) in the complex treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).

The compounds have been evaluated in radioligand binding assay at both sigma receptors and selected compounds tested for NO release. Compounds 9, 15, 18, 19, and 21 were subjected to MTT test. Compound 15 produced a significant reduction of MCF-7 and Caco-2 cellular viability with comparable IC50 as doxorubicin, being also not toxic for fibroblast HFF-1 cells. Compound 15 has shown a sigma(1), receptor antagonist/sigma(2) receptor agonist profile. Two derivatives of compound 15 lacking the nitrate group did not induce a reduction of MCF-7 cellular viability, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between the sigma receptors and the NO-mediated events. Overall, the combination of NO donor and sigma receptors ligands provided compounds with beneficial effects for the treatment of cancer.

The synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) can be used to index the number of nerve terminals, an indirect estimate of synaptic density. Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) with the SV2A radioligand [C-11]UCB-J to examine synaptic density in n = 26 unmedicated individuals with MDD, PTSD, or comorbid MDD/PTSD. The severity of depressive symptoms was inversely correlated with SV2A density, and individuals with high levels of depression showing lower SV2A density compared to healthy controls (n = 21). SV2A density was also associated with aberrant network function, as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) functional connectivity. This is the first in vivo evidence linking lower synaptic density to network alterations and symptoms of depression. Our findings provide further incentive to evaluate interventions that restore synaptic connections to treat depression.

The usual key to discovery is a realistic model for experimentation and for testing a hypothesis. A realistic model is especially needed in the case of the human prostate, which differs significantly from the prostate of species often used as research models. We will emphasize the genetic characterization of PSMA, the nature of the PSMA protein, and its role as a carboxypeptidase, with differing important substrates and products in different tissues. We give special prominence to the importance of PSMA as a target for imaging and therapy in prostate cancer and its underdeveloped role for imaging and targeting the neovasculature of tumors other than prostate cancer. Lastly, we bring attention to its importance in other nonprostatic tissues.

Preliminary small animal imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) in rats displayed high uptake in the kidneys with good contrast to surrounding tissue. Rat metabolism displayed the presence of 23% unchanged tracer in plasma at 30 min. Upon co-administration with AT(1)R blocker candesartan (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/kg), a dose-dependent reduction (47-65%) in tracer uptake was observed in the kidney, while no difference was observed following AT(2)R blocker PD123,319 (5 mg/kg), indicating binding selectivity for AT(1)R over AT(2)R and potential for imaging AT(1)R using PET.

A series of aporphines were docked into a homology model of the rat 5-HT2A receptor using AutoDock. Selected compounds with high in silico binding affinities were screened in vitro using radioligand-binding assays against rat serotonin (5-HT1A and 5-HT2A) and dopamine (D1 and D2) receptors. (R)-Roemerine and (+/-)-nuciferine were found to have high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor (Ki = 62 and 139 nm, respectively), with (R)-roemerine showing 20- to 400-fold selectivity for the 5-HT2A receptor over the 5-HT1A, D1 and D2 receptors. Investigation into the ligandreceptor interactions suggested that the selectivity of (R)-roemerine is due to it having stronger H-bonding and dipoledipole interactions with several of the key residues in the 5-HT2A receptor-binding site.

Evaluation in Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that [C-11]MP-10 had highest brain accumulation in the PDE10A enriched-striatum, the 30 min striatum: cerebellum ratio reached 6.55. MicroPET studies of [C-11]MP-10 in monkeys displayed selective uptake in striatum. However, a radiolabeled metabolite capable of penetrating the blood-brain-barrier may limit the clinical utility of [C-11] MP-10 as a PDE10A PET tracer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These were synthesized as potential positron emission tomography ligands for monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A). A solution of pure labelled compound in buffer was obtained in <70 min from end of radionuclide production, with a decay-corrected yield of up to 23%. The average specific binding to MAO-A in rat brain, determined by autoradiography experiments, was highest for compounds 7 and 8 (89 +/- 2 and 96 +/- 1%, respectively), which was obtained at <1 nM radioligand concentration.

Thirty-six family members had well-documented levodopa-responsive parkinsonism. The phenotype of affected individuals was indistinguishable from that of persons with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). The pattern of inheritance in 5 families was consistent with autosomal dominant transmission; in 3 families the mode of inheritance was uncertain. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies with the dopamine transporter radioligand [I-123]FP-CIT were performed in 1 family. The SPECT study showed striatal presynaptic dopaminergic degeneration consistent with sporadic PD in 1 affected family member and no signs of nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction in 5 at-risk individuals. Sequence analysis in all 8 families excluded known genes associated with familial parkinsonism. Genome-wide 2-point linkage studies in the largest 2 families did not identify significant linkage (z > 3.0), although positive scores were obtained for 5q23 (D5S1462 and D5S2501), a locus previously implicated in disease susceptibility.

We evaluated the sedative and anticonvulsant effects of LMR-101 to discover its potential to manage epilepsy and SE in the clinic. Methods: Comparative studies between LMR-101 and propofol were performed in mice to elucidate an appropriate dose range for LMR-101 that produced anticonvulsant effects without significant sedation. Then, the anticonvulsive efficacy for LMR-101 was evaluated using seizure models induced by pentylenetetrazol and (+)-bicuculline. The ability of LMR-101 to inhibit SE was assessed using a rat model of SE induced by pilocarpine. Radioligand binding assay profiles for LMR-101 were performed to evaluate the potential mechanisms of action underlying its anticonvulsant properties. Results: In the mouse study, LMR-101 exhibited greater anticonvulsant and lesser sedative effect compared with propofol. LMR-101 completely inhibited pentylenetetrazol-induced seizures at a dose of 50 mg/kg and exhibited heavy sedation at 300 mg/kg. Propofol anesthetized all mice and only decreased the seizure rate at 25 mg/kg. LMR-101 also suppressed seizure behaviors evoked by (+)-bicuculline in mice in a dose-dependent manner. In the pilocarpine-induced SE model, LMR-101 significantly decreased the maximum seizure score and seizure duration in a dose-dependent manner. The median effective dose for LMR-101 was 14.30 mg/kg and 121.87 mg/kg to prevent and inhibit sustained SE, respectively. In binding assays, LMR-101 primarily inhibited tert-[S-35] butylbicyclophosphorothionate binding to gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors (half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 2.06 mu mol center dot L-1), but it did not affect [H-3] flunitrazepam or [H-3] muscimol binding. Significance: It is anticipated that LMR-101 might play an essential role in the clinical management of epilepsy and SE. LMR-101 also might bind to a novel target site on the GABA(A) receptor that is different from existing antiepileptic drugs. Further study of the mechanisms of action of LMR-101 would be of considerable value in the search for new active drug sites on GABA(A) receptors.

GlyT1 inhibitors have therefore been considered to have antipsychotic therapeutic potential. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes for GlyT1 are, consequently, expected to be useful for investigating the mechanism of such disease conditions and for measuring occupancy of GlyT1 inhibitors in vivo. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of 2-chloro N-[(S)-{(S)-1-[(11) C]methylpiperidin-2-yl} (phenyl)methyl]3-trifluoromethyl-benzamide ([(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734) as a PET imaging agent for GlyT1. Methods: [(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734 was synthesized by N-[(11) C]methylation of SSR504734 via [(11) C]CH3OTf. In vitro brain distribution of [(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734 was tested in whole-hemisphere autoradiography (ARG) on human brain slices. Initial PET studies were performed using a cynomolgus monkey at baseline and after pretreatment with 0.1 to 1.5 mg/kg of SSR504734. Then, PET studies using rhesus monkeys were performed with arterial blood sampling at baseline and after pretreatment with 1.5 to 4.5 mg/kg SSR504734. Distribution volumes (V-T) were calculated with a two-tissue compartment model, and GlyT1 occupancy by SSR504734 was estimated using a Lassen plot approach. Results: [(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734 was successfully synthesized in moderate radiochemical yield and high specific radioactivity. In the ARG experiments, [(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734 showed specific binding in the white matter and pons. In the initial PET experiments in a cynomolgus monkey, [(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734 showed high brain uptake and consistent distribution with previously reported GlyT1 expression in vivo (thalamus, brainstem> cerebellum> cortical regions). However, the brain uptake increased after pretreatment with SSR504734. Further PET studies in rhesus monkeys showed a similar increase of brain uptake after pretreatment with SSR504734. However, the V-T of [(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734 was found to decrease after pretreatment of SSR504734 in a dose-dependent manner. GlyT1 occupancy was calculated to be 45% and 73% at 1.5 and 4.5 mg/kg of SSR504734, respectively. Conclusions: [(11) C]N-methyl-SSR504734 is demonstrated to be a promising PET radioligand for GlyT1 in nonhuman primates. The present results warrant further PET studies in human subjects.

Radioligand binding and electrophysiology were used to study the effects of LCM at well-established mammalian targets for clinical anticonvulsants. 10 mu M LCM did not bind with high affinity to a plethora of rodent, guinea pig or human receptor sites including: AMPA; Kainate; NMDA (glycine/PCP/MK801); GABA(A) (muscimol/benzodiazepine); GABA(B); adenosine A(1,2,3); alpha(1), alpha(2); beta(1), beta(2); M-1,M-2,M-3,M-4,M-5; H-1,H-2,H-3; CB1,2; D-1,D-2,D-3,D-4,D-5; 5HT(1A,1B.2A,2C,3.5A,6.7) and K-ATP, Weak displacement (25%) was evident at batrachotoxin site 2 on voltage gated Na+ channels. LCM did not inhibit neurotransmitter transport mechanisms for norepinephrine, dopamine, 5-HT or GABA, nor did it inhibit GABA transaminase. LCM at 100 mu M produced a significant reduction in the incidence of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC's) and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSC's) in cultured cortical cells and blocked spontaneous action potentials (EC50 61 mu M). LCM did not alter resting membrane potential or passive membrane properties following application of voltage ramps between -70 to +20 mV. The voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) blocker phenytoin potently blocked sustained repetitive firing (SRF) but, in contrast, 100 mu M LCM failed to block SRF. No effect was observed on voltage-clamped Ca2+ channels (T-, L-, N- or P-type). Delayed-rectifier or A-type potassium currents were not modulated by LCM (100 mu M). LCM did not mimic the effects of diazepam as an allosteric modulator of GABAA receptor currents, nor did it significantly modulate evoked excitatory neurotransmission mediated by NMDA or AMPA receptors (n >= 5). Evidently LCM perturbs excitability in primary cortical cultures but does not appear to do so via a high-affinity interaction with an acknowledged recognition site on a target for existing antiepileptic drugs.

To describe new assays for the detection and quantification of antibodies to RNPs in rheumatic diseases, using soluble nuclear antigens synthesized de novo in reticulocyte lysates, Methods. Sera from 381 patients with various rheumatic diseases, including 212 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), were analyzed in order to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of serum autoantibody reactivities to several recombinant soluble autoantigens: U1-A RNP, Sm-B, SSA/Ro 52 and SSA/Ro 60, SSB/La, and Ku, Radioligand assays (RLAs) were performed following the in vitro transcription and translation of each autoantigen from the corresponding complementary DNA, labeled with S-35-methionine. The radiolabeled protein was then bound by the specific serum autoantibody, forming immune complexes that were captured by protein A-Sepharose beads and quantified by counting the radioactivity. Results. Among the SLE patients, 44% were positive for anti-U1-A RNP activity, 34% for anti-Sm-B, 44% for anti-SSA (32% for Ro 52 and 46% for Ro 60), 32% for anti-SSB/La, and 11% for anti-Ku reactivities. SSA antibodies had a high frequency in patients with mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) (80%); 65% these patient sera reacted,vith Ro 52, 45% with Ro 60, and 45% with U1-A RNP, Twenty percent of the MCTD patients also exhibited antibodies to Sm-B and Ku, In patients with Sjogren's syndrome, anti-SSA was the main anti-RNP antibody (63%), together with SSB/La antibodies (44%), Among patients with inflammatory myopathy, only antibodies against Ro 52 (36%) and Ro 60 (36%) were present. These new RLA allowed observation of a strong correlation (P < 0.0001) between Sm-B antibody levels and the severity of SLE las measured by the SLE Disease Activity Index), and establishment of a correlation between anti-U1-A RNP antibodies and the occurrence of SLE nephritis (P < 0.02), All RLAs were highly specific for the antigen tested and displayed, in the disease groups studied, a higher sensitivity than conventional immunodiffusion assays. Conclusion. These highly sensitive, specific, and quantitative RLAs represent new tools for the detection of autoantibodies to RNP antigens in rheumatic diseases, and may be useful for (differential) diagnosis in clinical practice.

Both probes had a nanomolar binding affinity to the ER receptor (36.47 nM for [I-131]EITE and 61.83 nM for [I-131]MITE). They showed high uptake in ER-positive MCF-7 cells and tumors, which could be significantly blocked by a coinjection of excess estradiol. Their ER specificities were further demonstrated by the low uptake in ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and tumors. The maximum tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratios reach to 6.59 for [I-131]EITE at 1 h postinjection (p.i.) and to 3.69 for [I-131]MITE at 2 h p.i. in MCF-7 tumors. Among these two probes, [I-131]EITE showed a faster tumor accumulation and a higher T/M ratio indicating it could be a better candidate for the potential diagnosis of ER-positive breast cancers.

Using radioligand binding experiments we investigated their binding mode. We show that neuroactive steroids bind to two binding sites on muscarinic receptors. Their affinity for the high-affinity binding site is about 100 nM. Their affinity for the low-affinity binding site is about 10 mu M. The high-affinity binding occurs at the same site as binding of steroid-based WIN-compounds that is different from the common allosteric binding site for alcumnium or gallamine that is located between the second and third extracellular loop of the receptor. This binding site is also different from the allosteric binding site for the structurally related aminosteroid-based myorelaxants pancuronium and rapacuronium. Membrane cholesterol competes with neurosteroids/neuroactive steroids binding to both high- and low-affinity binding site, indicating that both sites are oriented towards the cell membrane..

Kratom contains over forty alkaloids including two partial agonists at the mu opioid receptor, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, that have been subjected to the FDA's scientific and medical evaluation. However, pharmacological and toxicological data for the remaining alkaloids are limited. Therefore, we applied the Public Health Assessment via Structural Evaluation (PHASE) protocol to generate in silico binding profiles for 25 kratom alkaloids to facilitate the risk evaluation of kratom. PHASE demonstrates that kratom alkaloids share structural features with controlled opioids, indicates that several alkaloids bind to the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors, and suggests that mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine are the strongest binders at the mu opioid receptor. Subsequently, the in silico binding profiles of a subset of the alkaloids were experimentally verified at the opioid, adrenergic, and serotonin receptors using radioligand binding assays. The verified binding profiles demonstrate the ability of PHASE to identify potential safety signals and provide a tool for prioritizing experimental evaluation of high-risk compounds.

Materials and Methods: Proliferation studies, global native EGFR and phosphorylated EGER expressions, phosphate transporter type III isoform 1 (PiT1) expression and phosphate transport with Tc-99m-(V)-DMSA radioligand were performed in G111 (grade II astrocytoma), U-87-MG (grade III astrocytoma) and G152 (grade IV glioblastoma) cells. Results: Cells treated with gefitinib showed a significant decrease in proliferation in relation to EGER and p-EGFR expression. Gefitinib also produced a decrease in phosphate transport mediated PIT1 expression at both the RNA and protein levels. Conclusion: The link between gefitinib acting on the EGFR and PiT1 regulation in these cancer cell lines was herein shown.

Clopidogrel-na < ve patients with stable CAD (n = 20) were enrolled and stratified according to smoking status. P2Y(12) receptor binding activity was determined by radioligand receptor binding prior and 24 h after a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel. Baseline P2Y(12) receptor binding was 1.8-fold higher in smokers compared with nonsmokers. After a 600-mg loading dose of clopidogrel, smokers showed a 6.4-fold reduction in P2Y(12) receptor binding indicative of marked clopidogrel-mediated blockade, while there were minimal changes among nonsmokers. Among patients with stable CAD, smokers have more P2Y(12) receptor binding than nonsmokers and have a higher degree of clopidogrel-mediated platelet inhibition.

The plasma samples were deproteinized with acetonitrile and the extracts were injected into the fast-LC system coupled to an on-line radioactivity detector. Under the optimum conditions, complete separation of target PET radioligands from their radioactive metabolites was achieved within the short run time of only 3.5-min. The limits of detection were 1.0 similar to 1.2 Becquerel (Bq) for C-11 and F-18-labeled compounds. This method can successfully be applied to study the metabolism of a wide variety of PET radioligands in human and monkey plasma with higher numbers of samples to be analyzed compared to the traditional LC method.

Competition binding experiments at alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR subtypes showed an overall significant reduction in affinity for the compounds under study in comparison to the reference radioligand [H-3]-epibatidine. These outcomes have been rationalized by taking into account the ligand-based pharmacophore models reported in the literature and the recently proposed molecular model of the alpha 4 beta 2 receptor subtype. Conversely, compounds 5b, 5c, and 6b exhibited a noticeable affinity for the alpha 7 receptors and, in the case of 5c, also some subtype selectivity. ((c) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Binding of the test compounds to the target was monitored by moss-spectrometric quantification of the nonbound marker, spiperone, in the supernatant of the binding samples obtained by centrifugation. A solid-phase extraction procedure was used for separating spiperone from ESI-MS-incompatible supernatant matrix components. Subsequently, the marker was reliably quantified by LC-ESI-MS-MS by using haloperidol as on internal standard. The affinities of the test compounds, the dopamine receptor antagonists (+)-butaclamol, chlorpromazine and (S)-sul-piride obtained from the competitive MS binding assay were verified by corresponding radioligand binding experiments with [H-3]spiperone. The results of this study demonstrate that competitive MS binding assays represent a universally applicable alternative to conventional radioligond binding assays.

Aqueous and 70% ethanolic extracts of various plant parts were screened and 45 extracts derived from 15 plant species showed affinity. The affinity of 12 extracts from four plants was characterized as high (more than 50% inhibition at 5, 1, and 0.5 mg/ml). Plant species with high affinity to the serotonin reuptake transport protein included Agapanthus campanulatus, Boophane disticha, Datura ferox and Xysmalobium undulatum. Agapanthus campanulatus yielded high activity in aqueous extracts from leaves and flowers. Boophane disticha showed high activity both in aqueous and ethanolic extracts of leaves and bulbs. Datura ferox showed high activity in aqueous extracts from the seeds and Xysmalobium undulatum showed high activity in the ethanolic extract of the whole plant. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Improved homology modeling of the human & rat EP<sub>4</sub> prostanoid receptors	BMC MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Prostaglandin E-2; Prostaglandin E-2 receptor; Prostaglandin E-2 receptor subtype 4; PGE(2); EP4; Homology model; Structure-based drug design; Bone healing; Heart failure	PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; SELECTIVE AGONISTS; ACCURATE DOCKING; FORCE-FIELD; PROTEIN; BINDING; GLIDE; PREVENTION; PREDICTION; MOLECULES	Background The EP4 prostanoid receptor is one of four GPCRs that mediate the diverse actions of prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)). Novel selective EP4 receptor agonists would assist to further elucidate receptor sub-type function and promote development of therapeutics for bone healing, heart failure, and other receptor associated conditions. The rat EP4 (rEP(4)) receptor has been used as a surrogate for the human EP4 (hEP(4)) receptor in multiple SAR studies. To better understand the validity of this traditional approach, homology models were generated by threading for both receptors using the RaptorX server. These models were fit to an implicit membrane using the PPM server and OPM database with refinement of intra and extracellular loops by Prime (Schrodinger). To understand the interaction between the receptors and known agonists, induced-fit docking experiments were performed using Glide and Prime (Schrodinger), with both endogenous agonists and receptor sub-type selective, small-molecule agonists. The docking scores and observed interactions were compared with radioligand displacement experiments and receptor (rat & human) activation assays monitoring cAMP. Results Rank-ordering of in silico compound docking scores aligned well with in vitro activity assay EC50 and radioligand binding K-i. We observed variations between rat and human EP4 binding pockets that have implications in future small-molecule receptor-modulator design and SAR, specifically a S103G mutation within the rEP4 receptor. Additionally, these models helped identify key interactions between the EP4 receptor and ligands including PGE(2) and several known sub-type selective agonists while serving as a marked improvement over the previously reported models. Conclusions This work has generated a set of novel homology models of the rEP(4) and hEP(4) receptors. The homology models provide an improvement upon the previously reported model, largely due to improved solvation. The hEP(4) docking scores correlates best with the cAMP activation data, where both data sets rank order Rivenprost>CAY10684 > PGE(1) approximate to PGE(2) > 11-deoxy-PGE(1) approximate to 11-dexoy-PGE(2) > 8-aza-11-deoxy-PGE(1). This rank-ordering matches closely with the rEP(4) receptor as well. Species-specific differences were noted for the weak agonists Sulprostone and Misoprostol, which appear to dock more readily within human receptor versus rat receptor.

C-11-(R)-2-CH3O- N-n-propylnorapomorphine (C-11-MNPA) is a new agonist radioligand for in vivo imaging of the high-affinity state of dopamine D-2 receptors using PET. In the present study, the kinetics of C-11-MNPA were examined for the first time, to our knowledge, in the human brain and analyzed using quantitative approaches with or without an arterial input function. Methods: A 90-min dynamic PET scan was obtained for 10 healthy men after an intravenous injection of C-11-MNPA. The binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the indirect kinetic method, a kinetic compartment analysis with a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. BPND was also calculated by the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and transient equilibrium methods, both with the cerebellum as the reference brain region. The results of the quantitative methods were compared in a cross-validation approach. Results: The highest regional radioactivity was observed in the putamen. BPND values obtained by kinetic analysis were 0.82 +/- 0.09, 0.59 +/- 0.11, and 0.28 +/- 0.06, respectively, in the putamen, caudate, and thalamus. BPND values obtained by the SRTM and transient equilibrium methods were in good agreement with those obtained by the indirect kinetic method (r = 0.98 and r - 0.93, respectively). For all quantification methods, the BPND values based on data acquired from 0 to 60 min were in good agreement with those based on data acquired from 0 to 90 min (r = 0.90-0.99). Conclusion: The regional distribution of C-11-MNPA binding was in good agreement with previous PET studies of dopamine D-2 receptors in the human brain using antagonist radioligands. The results support routine use of the SRTM and transient equilibrium methods, that is, methods that do not require an arterial input function and need a scan time of only about 60 min. C-11-MNPA should thus be useful for clinical research on the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and estimation of dopamine D-2 receptor occupancy by dopaminergic drugs.

Improved Synthesis of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]COU and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PHXY, Evaluation of Neurotoxicity, and Imaging of MAOs in Rodent Heart	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Cardiac PET; MAO imaging; monoamine oxidase; radiochemistry; carbon-11; positron emission tomography		The radiotracers [C-11]COU and [C-11]PHXY are potential PET imaging agents for in vivo studies of monoamine oxidases (MAOs), as previously shown in rodent and primate brain. One-pot, automated methods for the radiosynthesis of [C-11]PHXY and [C-11]COU were developed to provide reliable and improved radiochemical yields. Although derived from the structure of the neurotoxin MPTP, COU did not exhibit in vivo neurotoxicity to dopaminergic nerve terminals in the mouse brain as assayed by losses of VMAT2 radioligand binding. PET imaging studies in rats demonstrated that both [C-11]COU and [C-11]PHXY exhibit retention in cardiac tissues that can be blocked by pretreatment with the MAO inhibitors deprenyl (MAO-B) and pargyline (MAO-A and -B). In addition to prior neuroimaging applications, [C-11]COU and [C-11]PHXY are thus also of interest for studies of MAO enzymatic activity and imaging of sympathetic nerve density in heart.

The analogues 6 and 7 exhibit very different pharmacological profiles with binding affinity preference for the subtypes GluA1 and GluA3, respectively. X-ray crystal structures of three ligands (6, 7, and 8) in complex with the agonist binding domain (ABD) of GluA2 show that they induce full domain closure despite their low agonist efficacies. Trp767 in GluA2 ABD could be an important determinant for partial agonism of this compound series at AMPA receptors, since agonist efficacy also correlated with the location of the Trp767 side chain.

After cells were cultured for 48 h with various concentrations of DAB(389)EGF, the percentage reduction in thymidine incorporation was determined. For 13 of 14 cell lines, potent cytotoxicity was observed, with IC(50)s of 0.4-50 pm. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) density of these cell lines was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and radioligand binding. These assays correlated well with each other and demonstrated FGFR levels of 15,000-230,000/cell for 13 of 14 cell lines. The cell line U138MG, which lacked EGFR, was the only cell line insensitive to DAB(389)EGF. Linear regression analysis showed a good correlation between EGFR density and DAB389EGF sensitivity (P < 0.001) and between results of flow cytometry and radiolabeled binding assays of EGFR density (P = 0.01). DAB(389)EGF may have potential for intracranial therapy of EGFR-positive glioblastomas.

Combination of this synthetic methodology with an isolation step carried out by means of the Girard-P reagent, the corresponding ethers of 13-epi-estrone were obtained in excellent yields. The 3-hydroxy and 3-methoxy D-homoestrone derivatives in both the normal and the 13alpha-estrone series were then synthesized and tested in vitro in a radioligand-binding assay. The estrogen receptor recognizes these compounds, but their relative binding affinities (RBAs) are lower than that of the reference compound 3,17beta-estradiol. The progesterone receptor-binding affinities of the four D-homo derivatives were also tested showing low values for 13alpha-D-homoestrone and its 3-methyl ether. Pharmacologically, these 13alpha-D-homoestrone derivatives are estrogen receptor-selective molecules. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Measuring the density of TSPO with PET typically requires absolute quantitation with arterial blood sampling, because a reference region devoid of TSPO does not exist in the brain. We sought to determine whether a simple ratio method could substitute for absolute quantitation of binding with C-11-PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for TSPO. Methods: C-11-PBR28 PET imaging was performed in 21 healthy controls, 11 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 25 AD patients. Group differences in C-11-PBR28 binding were compared using 2 methods. The first was the gold standard method of calculating total distribution volume (VT), using the 2-tissue-compartment model with the arterial input function, corrected for plasma-free fraction of radiotracer (fP). The second method used a ratio of brain uptake in target regions to that in cerebellum-that is, standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR). Results: Using absolute quantitation, we confirmed that TSPO binding (VT/fP) was greater in AD patients than in healthy controls in expected temporoparietal regions and was not significantly different among the 3 groups in the cerebellum. When the cerebellum was used as a pseudo-reference region, the SUVR method detected greater binding in AD patients than controls in the same regions as absolute quantification and in 1 additional region, suggesting SUVR may have greater sensitivity. Coefficients of variation of SUVR measurements were about two-thirds lower than those of absolute quantification, and the resulting statistical significance was much higher for SUVR when comparing AD and healthy controls (e.g., P < 0.0005 for SUVR vs. P = 0.023 for V-T/fP in combined middle and inferior temporal cortex). Conclusion: To measure TSPO density in AD patients and control subjects, a simple ratio method SUVR can substitute for, and may even be more sensitive than, absolute quantitation. The SUVR method is expected to improve subject tolerability by allowing shorter scanning time and not requiring arterial catheterization. In addition, this ratio method allows smaller sample sizes for comparable statistical significance because of the relatively low variability of the ratio values.

These nanocarriers are internally crosslinked hydrophilic macromolecules-nanogels-bearing carboxylic groups to facilitate functionalization. PAA nanogels were conjugated with an engineered bombesin-derivative-oligopeptide combined with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate chelating moiety, aimed to provide selective radioligand transport. 4-(4,6-Dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium (DMTMM) toluene-4-sulfonate was used as the coupling agent. After tests on a model amine-p-toluidine-both commercial and home-synthesized DOTA-bombesin were successfully coupled to the nanogels and the obtained products were characterized. The radiolabeling efficiency of nanocarriers with Lu-177, was chromatographically tested. The results provide a proof of concept for the synthesis of radiation-synthesized nanogel-based radioisotope nanocarriers for theranostic applications.

While imidazole-containing compounds display drawbacks in pharmacokinetics, we studied the possibility of replacing the heteroaromatic cycle by nonaromatic six-membered heterocycles (piperidine, morpholine, thiomorpholine, and N-methylpiperazine) as potential bioisosteres. Beyond that, this approach should give more information about the indispensability of the aromatic ring as a basic head group. Besides these changes, a variation of the spacer length (C-3-C-5) connecting the heterocycle and the cyanoguanidine moiety has been made to possibly trigger the selectivity towards the respective HRs. Investigations in radioligand-binding assays exhibited only very weak activity at the hH(1)R and hH(3)R, while nearly all compounds were inactive at the hH(2)R and hH(4)R. In the case of piperidine-containing compounds, moderate affinities at the hH(3)R over the single-digit micromolar range were detected.

Multidentate <SUP>18</SUP>F-Polypegylated Styrylpyridines As Imaging Agents for Aβ Plaques in Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA)	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ALPHA(V)BETA(3) INTEGRIN; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PET; F-18-FLUTEMETAMOL; MICROBLEEDS; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; STILBENES	beta-Amyloid plaques (A beta plaques) in the brain are associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Imaging agents that could target the A beta plaques in the living human brain would be potentially valuable as biomarkers in patients with CAA. A new series of F-18 styrylpyridine derivatives with high molecular weights for selectively targeting A beta plaques in the blood vessels of the brain but excluded from the brain parenchyma is reported. The styrylpyridine derivatives, 8a-c, display high binding affinities and specificity to A beta plaques (K-i = 2.87, 3.24, and 7.71 nM, respectively). In vitro autoradiography of [F-18]8a shows labeling of beta-amyloid plaques associated with blood vessel walls in human brain sections of subjects with CAA and also in the tissue of AD brain sections. The results suggest that [F-18]8a may be a useful PET imaging agent for selectively detecting A beta plaques associated with cerebral vessels in the living human brain.

Effect of chronic administration of ethanol on the regulation of the δ-subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the rat brain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						chronic ethanol; GABA(A) receptors; delta-subunit; polypeptide levels; immunoprecipitation; radioligand binding	TYROSINE KINASE PHOSPHORYLATION; CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; A RECEPTORS; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSES; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; GENE-EXPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNAS; ALCOHOL ACTION	In the present study, we investigated the effect of chronic ethanol (CE) administration on the polypeptide levels of the delta-subunit of GABA(A) receptors and [H-3]muscimol binding to the immunoprecipitated delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor assemblies in the rat brain. CE administration resulted a down-regulation of polypeptide levels of the delta-subunit of GABA(A) receptors in the rat cerebellum and hippocampus, whereas there were no changes in the delta-subunit polypeptide levels in the rat cerebral cortex. Further, CE administration caused a down-regulation of native delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptor assemblies in the rat cerebellum as determined by [H-3]muscimol binding to the immunoprecipitated receptor assemblies. These results indicate that the delta-subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors may play a role in chronic ethanol-induced tolerance and dependence. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

If labeled with a longer physical half-life radioisotope, this ligand could be more attractive to research groups lacking an on-site cyclotron or lacking C-I I synthesis capabilities. We produce p-[F-18]fluorobenzyl iodide on a routine basis to synthesize several neuroimaging agents. Therefore, it was straightforward for us to substitute the DASB precursor with this prosthetic group and assess its biological properties. We designed a different synthesis strategy to obtain the DASB precursor (desmethyl DASB). Herein we report an efficient and facile synthetic route that provides higher chemical yields of 3-amino-4-(2aniinomethylphenylsulfanyl)benzonitrile and related analogues. In addition, we report our results from incorporating p-[F-18]fluorobenzyl iodide in DASB precursor and its affect on the in vitro and in vivo biological properties of the DASB.

Furthermore, the influence of extracellular calcium was analyzed, through functional and radioligand binding assays. The rank order of potency for selective muscarinic antagonists for M-1, M-2, and M-3 receptor subtypes, measured from affinity (pA(2)) values, was p-fluorohexahydrosiladifenidol (pFHHSiD) (M-3) > pirenzepine (M-1) > methoctramine (M-2), indicating a predominance Of M-3 subtype. This order was unchanged with age. Contractions by muscarinic agonist methacholine (MCh) were diminished in aged rats, resulting in lower apparent affinity (pD(2)) values, compared with adult controls. A larger decrease of MCh contractions occurred in aged rats after Ca2+ withdrawal or after the calcium channel blocker isradipine. Changes were not detected for relaxation by adrenergic agonists. In conclusion, aging caused a decrease of MCh potency, which is probably related to the reduction of calcium sensitivity in jejunum.

The development of effective mGluR radiotracers would provide essential tools with which to probe these sites in living humans, providing critical information about certain disease processes involving the glutamaterigic system and its regulation in humans. As a first step towards this goal, the tritiated form of the high affinity group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonist LY341495 [K-D (mGluR(2)) = 1.67 +/- 0.20 nM, K-D (mGluR(3)) = 0.75 +/- 0.43 nM] was evaluated to determine its potential to label mGluRs in vivo. Dissection analysis of the regional brain distribution over time of [H-3]LY341495 in male rats revealed low brain uptake and no significant demonstrable saturable binding of this tracer. A group II mGluR tracer possessing higher affinity than [H-3]LY341495 and an absence of carboxylic acid groups is likely required for in vivo PET imaging purposes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc.

We investigated the role of the AM receptor (AMR) and the calcitonin gene-related peptide type-1 receptor (CGRP1R) in regulating pulmonary vascular AM levels. The AMR antagonist hAM(22-52) (120 nmol/L) significantly elevated AM release compared with controls to 250% after 2h in isolated rat lungs and to 830% after 4h in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAEC). CGRPIR blockade had no effect. AMR blockade did not influence prepro-AM mRNA levels nor did inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide (0.01 mg/mL) abolish the effect of the AMR antagonist. Radioligand-binding studies with PAEC membranes revealed a decrease by 44% of the AMR density in response to AMR antagonism. Altogether, the pulmonary vascular AMR represents not only a functionally active, but also a clearance receptor; its expression is constitutively stimulated by basal AM. This identifies a novel mechanism for controlling pulmonary AM levels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

In this study we compared the effects of alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), beta-MSH and gamma(1)-MSH (0.2, 1.0 and 5.0 mu g, i.c.v.) on food intake. alpha-MSH and beta-MSH inhibited spontaneous food intake in a dose dependent manner, whereas the gamma(1)-MSH did not. alpha-MSH and beta-MSH but not gamma(1)-MSH tall 5.0 mu g, i.c.v. inhibited fasting-induced food intake about 50%. None of the three peptides inhibited fluid consumption in water-deprived (24 h) rats. It is suggested that MC, receptor, activated selectively by gamma(1)-MSH, is not involved in the regulation of food intake. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

A standard 3 + 3 dose escalation protocol was performed. The following dose levels were ultimately evaluated: 1.11, 1.85, and 2.59 GBq/cycle. Patients received [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 therapy for up to two cycles at a 6-week interval.Results Patients received fractionated doses of [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 ranging from 1.11 to 2.59 GBq per cycle. Myelosuppression was dose-limiting at 2.59 GBq, and 1.85 GBq was determined to be the MTD. The total-body effective dose for Lu-177-LNC1003 was 0.35 +/- 0.05 mSv/MBq. The salivary glands were found to receive the highest estimated radiation dose, which was calculated to be 3.61 +/- 2.83 mSv/MBq. The effective doses of kidneys and red bone marrow were 1.88 +/- 0.35 and 0.22 +/- 0.04 mSv/MBq, respectively. The tumor mean absorbed doses for bone and lymph node metastases were 8.52 and 9.51 mSv/MBq. Following the first treatment cycle, PSA decline was observed in 1 (33.3%), 4 (66.7%), and 2 (50.0%) patients at dose levels 1 (1.11 GBq), 2 (1.85 GBq), and 3 (2.59 GBq), respectively. Compared with the baseline serum PSA value, 1 (33.3%) at dose level 1 and 4 (66.6%) patients at dose level 2, presented a PSA decline after the second treatment cycle.Conclusion This phase 1 trial revealed that the MTD of [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 is 1.85 GBq. The treatment with multiple cycles at the dose of 1.11 GBq /cycle and 1.85 GBq /cycle was well tolerated. [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 has higher tumor effective doses in bone and lymph nodes metastases while the absorbed dose in the red bone marrow should be closely monitored in future treatment studies with higher doses and multiple cycles. The frequency of administration also needs to be further explored to assess the efficacy and side effects of [Lu-177]Lu-LNC1003 treatment.

Streamlined Schemes for Dosimetry of <SUP>177</SUP>Lu-Labeled PSMA Targeting Radioligands in Therapy of Prostate Cancer	CANCERS			English	Article						PSMA; therapy; prostate cancer; dosimetry; single time-point	LU-177-PSMA-617 THERAPY; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; SINGLE MEASUREMENT; MONTE-CARLO; BONE-MARROW; RADIATION; SOFTWARE; ANTIBODY; GLANDS; SPECT	Simple Summary In patients with progressive metastasized castration-resistance prostate cancer PSMA radioligand therapies have shown promising results regarding clinical safety and efficacy. Dosimetry is mandatory due to legal regulations and also required for the estimation of doses to organs at risk allowing for individual tailoring of treatment in PSMA-RLT. Due to those factors and the often poor health status of patients which restricts intense dosimetric imaging protocols, there is a clear need for simplified dosimetric approaches in mCRPC patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. In this study, we evaluated different dosimetric methodologies and found that a streamlined dosimetric approach is feasible and valid. This approach is based on single time-point imaging at 48 h p.i. in cycle 2 to 6 taking into account kinetic results of a full dosimetric scheme performed only in cycle1. These results might have a relevant impact on patients handling regarding dosimetry during [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy. (Background) Aim of this retrospective analysis was to investigate in mCRPC patients treated with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 whether the absorbed dose (AD) in organs at risk (OAR, i.e., kidneys and parotid glands) can be calculated using simplified methodologies with sufficient accuracy. For this calculation, results and kinetics of the first therapy cycle were used. (Methods) 46 patients treated with 2 to 6 cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 were included. As reference (current clinical standard) full dosimetry of the OAR based on quantitative imaging (whole body scintigraphy and quantitative SPECT/CT at 2, 24, 48 and 72 h p.i.) for every cycle was used. Alternatively, two dosimetry schemes, simplified in terms of image acquisition and dose calculation, were established, both assuming nearly unchanged kinetics of the radiopharmaceutical for subsequent cycles. (Results) In general, for both OAR the simplified methods provided results that were consistent with the dosimetric reference method, both per cycle and in terms of cumulative AD. Best results were obtained when imaging was performed at 48 h p.i. in each of the subsequent cycles. However, both simplified methods tended to underestimate the cumulative AD. (Conclusion) Simplified dosimetry schemes are feasible to tailor multi-cycle [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-targeted therapies.

Brain serotonin reuptake did not change during one year in overtrained athletes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE			English	Article						neurotransmission; overtraining; SPET; Nor-beta-CIT	NOR-BETA-CIT; TRANSPORTER BINDING; MESSENGER-RNA; STRESS; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; DYSFUNCTION; CAPACITY; SITES; SCALE	Brain 5-HT neurotransmission has been described to be down-regulated in depressed people, and also suspected to be changed in overtraining state, the consequence of long-term physical overloading and stress in athletes. We studied brain serotonin (5-HT) transporter binding i.e., 5-HT reuptake with the specific radioligand (123-1-labelled 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta[4-iodopenyl]nortropane, Nor-beta-CIT), and with single photon emission tomography (SPET) in severely overtrained athletes and their controls at the baseline and after a one-year recovery period. Twelve overtrained (6 women and 6 men, mean age 27 yrs, range 16 39 yrs) and 11 healthy (6 women, 5 men, 26yrs, 20-39 yrs) athletes were examined. Overtrained athletes 1) had suffered from an unexplained decrement in physical performance and fatigue for several weeks to many months and continued to have the same symptoms even after a recovery time of weeks to months, 2) had been examined to be otherwise healthy, and 3) had a suitable training history for overtraining. Nor-beta-CIT SPET was acquired 5 min, and 3, 6, and 24 h after the injection of the radioligand. 5-HT reuptake in ml/ml in midbrain (raphe nuclei) was calculated as (midbrain-cerebellum)/cerebellum. According to two-way analysis of variance, no changes inside the groups or group differences in 5-HT reuptake were found. Male athletes had significantly higher 5-HT reuptake than female athletes at the baseline (p = 0.034). The overtrained athletes were moderately depressed, while their scores in standardized Hamilton and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scales were 16 +/- 2 (mean +/- SEM, range 8 - 29) and 17 +/- 2 (7 - 28), respectively. In the CA, the scores were 6 +/- 1 (range 2 - 18) and 6 2 (1 - 19), respectively. 5-HT reuptake did not correlate with the depression scores either in the whole group or in the OA. The finding of the present study does not support the idea of long-term changes in 5-HT neurotransmission in overtraining state, in this case serotonin reuptake in midbrain, the regulating area of brain serotonin neurotransmission. Furthermore, depression of overtrained athletes may be its own variant having no correlation with 5-HT reuptake in midbrain. Sex may have effect on chronic stress response at the brain level in athletes, which may be a confusing factor in the overtraining studies, and has to be taken into consideration in the future.

To provide a potential NMDA/PCP receptor PET tracer, we synthesized the radioligand [(11)]GMOM (K-i = 5.2 +/- 0.3 nM; log P = 2.34) and evaluated this ligand in vivo in awake male rats and isoflurane anesthetized baboons. In rats, the regional brain uptake of [C-11]GMOM ranged from 0.75 +/- 0.13% ID/g in the medulla and pons to 1.15 +/- 0.17% ID/g in the occipital cortex. MK801 (1 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced (24-28%) [C-11]GMOM uptake in all regions. D-serine (10 mg/kg i.v.) increased [C-11]GMOM %ID/g values in all regions (10-24%) reaching significance in the frontal cortex and cerebellum only. The NR2B ligand RO 25-6981 (10 mg/kg i.v.) reduced [C-11]GMOM uptake significantly (24-38%) in all regions except for the cerebellum and striatum. Blood activity was 0. 11+/-0.03 %ID/g in the controls group and did not vary significantly across groups. PET imaging in isoflurane-anesthetized baboons with high specific activity [C-11]GMOM provided fairly uniform regional brain distribution volume (V,) values (12.8-17.1 ml g(-1)). MK801 (0.5 mg/kg, i.v., n = 1, and 1.0 mg/kg, i.v., n = 1) did not significantly alter regional V-T values, indicating a lack of saturable binding. However, the potential confounding effects associated with ketamine induction of anesthesia along with isoflurane maintenance must be considered because both agents are known to reduce NMDA ion channel activation. Future and carefully designed studies, presumably utilizing an optimized NMDA/PCP site tracer, will be carried out to further explore these hypotheses. We conclude that, even though [C-11]GMOM is not an optimized PCP site radiotracer, its binding is altered in vivo in awake rats as expected by modulation of NMDA ion channel activity by MK801, D-serine or RO 25-6981. The development of higher affinity NMDA/PCP site radioligands is in progress. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the BD1 bromodomain and facilitate brain permeable domain-selective inhibitor development, we describe here the development of the first BET BD1 positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]1a. Compound la was tested to possess potent binding affinities and good selectivity (> 20-fold over BD2) for BD1 bromodomains of BRD2 (K-d = 25 nM), BRD3 (K-d = 24 nM), and BRD4 (K-d = 19 nM). Physicochemical characterization of la indicated the brain permeability and specific binding. [C-11]1a was radiosynthesized in a good radiochemical yield (RCY: 25-30%) and molar activity (258 GBq mu mol(-1)). The PET imaging studies of [C-11]1a in mice showed moderate brain uptake (with peak SUV = 0.7) and binding specificity. Furthermore, [C-11]1a demonstrated translational potential in the non-human primate (NHP) PET imaging study, which sets the stage for clinical translation.

Crystal data of 8 NDAs (4 free bases and 4 salts) were obtained, in which crassicauline A, aconitine HCl, and methyllycaconitine HClO4 are reported for the first time. 1D/2D NMR spectroscopies of 7 NDAs (5 free bases and 2 salts) were recorded comprehensively. Crystal conformations of NDAs are described with a revised cyclohexane ring nomenclature. The A/E-rings of NDA-free bases exist in twisted-chair/twisted-chair conformations, leading to examples of the H-1 NMR effect of steric compression shown in the A-ring. The A/E-rings of NDA salts adopt boat/chair crystal conformations, as does the protonated synthetic [3.3.1]azabicycle in its crystal lattice. However, in aqueous solutions at physiological pH, this protonated analogue adopts a true chair/true chair conformation where the NDA salts retain their twisted boat/twisted chair conformations.

The operational model (OM) of pharmacological agonism is a useful means for achieving this goal. Allosteric ligands bind to receptors at sites that are distinct from those of endogenous agonists that interact with the orthosteric domain on the receptor. An allosteric modulator and an orthosteric agonist bind simultaneously to the receptor to form a ternary complex, where the allosteric modulator affects the binding affinity and operational efficacy of the agonist. Allosteric modulators are an intensively studied group of receptor ligands because of their selectivity and preservation of physiological space-time pattern of the signals they modulate. We analysed the operational model of allosterically-modulated agonism (OMAM) including modulation by allosteric agonists. Similar to OM, several parameters of OMAM are inter-dependent. We derived equations describing mutual relationships among parameters of the functional response and OMAM. We present a workflow for the robust fitting of OMAM to experimental data using derived equations.

Brief communication: β-cell function influences dopamine receptor availability	PLOS ONE			English	Article							INSULIN SENSITIVITY; RELEASE; REWARD	We aim to identify physiologic regulators of dopamine (DA) signaling in obesity but previously did not find a compelling relationship with insulin sensitivity measured by oral-minimal model (OMM) and DA subtype 2 and 3 receptor (D2/3R) binding potential (BPND). Reduced disposition index (DI), a beta-cell function metric that can also be calculated by OMM, was shown to predict a negative reward behavior that occurs in states of lower endogenous DA. We hypothesized that reduced DI would occur with higher D2/3R BPND, reflecting lower endogenous DA. Participants completed PET scanning, with a displaceable radioligand to measure D2/3R BPND, and a 5-hour oral glucose tolerance test to measure DI by OMM. We studied 26 age-similar females without (n = 8) and with obesity (n = 18) (22 vs 39 kg/m(2)). Reduced DI predicted increased striatal D2/3R BPND independent of BMI. By accounting for beta-cell function, we were able to determine that the state of insulin and glucose metabolism is pertinent to striatal D2/3R BPND in obesity.

Mechanism of Paroxetine (Paxil) Inhibition of the Serotonin Transporter	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-I; SPECIES-SCANNING MUTAGENESIS; ANTIDEPRESSANT BINDING-SITE; HIGH-AFFINITY RECOGNITION; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; NOREPINEPHRINE TRANSPORTERS; STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; BACTERIAL HOMOLOG; MEMBRANE-PROTEINS	The serotonin transporter (SERT) is an integral membrane protein that exploits preexisting sodium-, chloride-, and potassium ion gradients to catalyze the thermodynamically unfavorable movement of synaptic serotonin into the presynaptic neuron. SERT has garnered significant clinical attention partly because it is the target of multiple psychoactive agents, including the antidepressant paroxetine (Paxil), the most potent selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor known. However, the binding site and orientation of paroxetine in SERT remain controversial. To provide molecular insight, we constructed SERT homology models based on the Drosophila melanogaster dopamine transporter and docked paroxetine to these models. We tested the predicted binding configurations with a combination of radioligand binding and flux assays on wild-type and mutant SERTs. Our data suggest that the orientation of paroxetine, specifically its fluorophenyl ring, in SERT's substrate binding site directly depends on this pocket's charge distribution, and thereby provide an avenue toward understanding and enhancing high-affinity antidepressant activity.

As a result of the high mitochondrial activity in tumors, Tc-99m MIBI accumulates significantly more in tumor tissue compared with normal tissues. Accordingly, Tc-99m MIBI has been used successfully to visualize primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumor. In brain tumors, Tc-99m MIBI SPECT has been shown to identify tumor recurrence after treatment in high-grade gliomas. In this report, early (30 minutes after injection) and delayed (4 hours after injection) Tc-99m MIBI SPECT did not visualize a histopathologically proved recurrent high-grade oligodendroglioma. Increased vascular supply, disruption of the blood-brain barrier, high-grade cancer, and viability of tumor cells are decisive factors related to increased Tc-99m MIBI uptake in brain tumors. However, the authors' results suggest that still other mechanisms may be involved in Tc-99m MIBI accumulation, which may account for false-negative imaging in brain tumors.

They all possessed significant beta -adrenoceptor blocking activities under in vitro experiments and radioligand binding assays. In addition, some compounds were further examined in in vivo tests and produced antagonist effects matching that of propranolol and labetalol by measurements of antagonism coward (-) isoproterenol-induced tachycardia and (-)phenylephrine-induced presser responses in anesthetized rats. Furthermore. all of the compounds had antioxidant effects inherited from their original structures. In conclusion. compound 11 had the most potent beta -adrenoceptors blocking activity. 12 and 13 possessed high cardioselectivity, whereas 14, 15 and 16 possessed additional alpha -adrenoceptor blocking activity and 15 is the most effective antioxidant of all. The antioxidant activity may be due to their alpha and beta unsaturated side chain at position 1 and ortho-substituted methoxy moiety on 4-phenoxyethylamine. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Pharmacologic doses of the glucose analogue, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) cause acute glucoprivation and are associated with enhanced dopamine turnover in preclinical studies. In this study, we utilized [C-11]raclopride PET to examine 2DG-induced striatal dopamine release in healthy volunteers. Six healthy volunteers underwent PET scans involving assessment of 2DG-induced (40 mg/kg) decrements in striatal binding of the D-2/D-3 receptor radioligand [C-11]raclopride. Decreases in [C-11]raclopride specific binding reflect 2DG-induced changes in synaptic dopamine. Specific binding significantly decreased following 2DG administration, reflecting enhanced synaptic dopamine concentrations (p = .02). The administration of 2DG is associated with significant striatal dopamine release in healthy volunteers. Implications of these data for investigations of the role of stress in psychiatric disorders are discussed. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

Two VMAT2 radioligands [C-1(1)]DTBZ and [F-18]FP-DTBZ have been used to assess the degree of nigrostriatal deficit in Parkinson's disease (PD) using positron emission tomography (PET). [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4, the nondeuterated analogue of [F-18]FE-DTBZ showed similar imaging properties with better stability against defluorination. Therefore, [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 draws attention to be investigated as an imaging marker for VMAT2 in the brain. The aim of this study was to investigate the brain kinetics and quantification of [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 in nonhuman primates (NHPs), with comparison to [C-11]DTBZ and [F-18]FE-DTBZ. Radiolabeling was successfully achieved either by one-step C-11-methylation or by a two-step fluorine-18 nucleophilic substitution reaction. The stability and radiochemical yield were analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Three female cynomolgus monkeys were included in the study and underwent a total of 12 positron emission tomography (PET) measurements. Each monkey was examined with each tracer. In addition, two pretreatment and one displacement PET measurements with tetrabenazine (2.0 mg/kg) were performed for [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4. All PET measurements were conducted using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) system. Radiometabolites were measured in monkey plasma using gradient radio-HPLC. [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 (SUV: 4.28 +/- 1.01) displayed higher brain uptake compared to both [F-18]FE-DTBZ (SUV: 3.43 +/- 0.54) and [C-11]DTBZ (SUV: 3.06 +/- 0.32) and faster washout. Binding potential (BP ND ) values of [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 in different brain regions (putamen: 5.5 +/- 1.4; caudate: 4.4 +/- 1.1; midbrain: 1.4 +/- 0.4) were higher than those of [C-11]DTBZ and [F-18]FE-DTBZ. [F-18]FE-DTBZ showed faster radiometabolism in plasma compared to [C-11]DTBZ and [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4. [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 is a suitable radioligand for quantification of VMAT2 in the nonhuman primate brain, with better imaging properties than [C-11]DTBZ and [F-18]FE-DTBZ. A preliminary comparison suggests that [F-18]FE-DTBZ-d4 has increased stability against defluorination compared to the nondeuterated analogue.

Early treatment response at the first restaging after two therapy cycles might correlate with high treatment efficacy and long overall survival (OS). Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate whether early reduction in tumor volume is a positive prognosticator for OS. To this end, PSMA PET prior to therapy (baseline) and at first restaging after two therapy cycles (interim; i.e., 12 weeks) were compared. Methods: Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received Lu-PSMA therapy were reviewed for this analysis. All patients with available baseline and interim [Ga-68]-PSMA-11 PET/CT were included in this analysis (n = 33). All PSMA avid metastases in baseline and interim PETs were semi-automatically segmented. The average PSMA expression (mean SUVmax of all metastases), total tumor volume (PSMA-TV) and TLQ (quotients of tumor volume and SUVmean summed over all metastases) were quantified at baseline and interim timepoints. Response in PSMA-TV was assumed when a decline 30% was present. OS and biochemical response were available for all patients. Results: Baseline PSMA-TV was a statistically significant prognosticator of OS (HR = 1.618 95%CI: 1.117 - 2.343, p = 0.011). Reduction in PSMA-TV was not a statistically significant positive prognosticator of OS in the total cohort (HR = 0.829 95%CI: 0.559 - 1.230, p = 0.352). Likewise, there was no statistical difference in survival time comparing patients with PSMA-TV response to those without (13.2 vs. 15.6 months, p = 0.1). In the subgroup of patients with PSMA-TV response, mean SUVmax was a statistically significant prognosticator of OS (binarized by median; HR = 0.15; 95%CI: 0.03 - 0.83; p < 0.05). If patients with low PSMA expression at baseline were excluded from the analysis, reduction in PSMA-TV became a positive prognosticator of OS in uni- and multivariable Cox regression (HR = 0.290; 95%CI: 0.108 - 0.782; p = 0.015). Conclusion: PSMA-TV reduction was a positive prognosticator of OS only if patients with low PSMA expression were excluded. This might indicate that the PSMA-PETs of patients with low PSMA expression may not be suited for assessing PSMA-TV reduction.

The present study was designed to define the safety and initial response to a minimal effective injected activity/cycle of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients. New protective agents for salivary glands and kidney were co-administered and dosimetry was carried out. Patients and methods A prospective single-arm, open label phase II study on mCRPC was activated at our institute in April 2017. Patients with histologically confirmed advanced mCRPC previously treated with standard life-prolonging agents were enrolled. Folic polyglutamate tablets were orally administered as parotid gland protectors and 500 mL of a 10% mannitol solution was intravenously infused to reduce kidney uptake before the injection of 3.7-5.5 GBq of Lu-177-PSMA-617 repeated four times at interval of 8 weeks. The adsorbed dose calculation was performed with MIRD formalism (OLINDA/EXM software). The Bryant and Day design was used to estimate the sample size taking account of both activity and toxicity. Results Forty-three eligible patients were evaluated for toxicity and initial response. Dosimetry was carried out in 13 patients. Two (4.8%) patients had G3 and 8 (19.5%) had G2 hematological toxicity. Only 3 (6.9%) patients had mild G1 salivary gland toxicity and 8 (19.5%) had G1 renal toxicity. A decrease of >= 30% in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was achieved after the first cycle in 17 (40.5%) patients, of whom 13 had a PSA decline of >50% after the second cycle. The median adsorbed doses were 0.65 mGy/MBq (range 0.33-2.63) for parotid glands, 0.42 mGy/MBq (0.14-0.81) for kidneys, 0.036 mGy/MBq (0.023-0.067) for red marrow, and 0.038 mGy/MBq (0.018-0.135) for the whole body. Conclusion In advanced, heavily pre-treated mCRPC patients, 3.7 GBq/cycle of Lu-177-PSMA-617 was safe and produced early biochemical and imaging responses at PSMA whole-body scan post injection. Dosimetry of salivary glands suggests that the co-administration of polyglutamate tablets may reduce salivary gland uptake.

More recently, a PSMA ligand was developed that can be labeled with Ga-68, Lu-177, and Y-90. This ligand, named PSMA-617, therefore enables both diagnosis and therapy of PCa. The aims of this evaluation were to clinically investigate the distribution of Ga-68-PSMA-617 in normal tissues and in PCa lesions as well as to evaluate the radiation exposure by the radioligand in PET imaging. Methods: Nineteen patients, most of them with recurrent PCa, were referred for Ga-68-PSMA-617 PET/CT. The quantitative assessment of tracer uptake of several organs and of 53 representative tumor lesions was performed in 15 patients at 1 and 3 h after injection. In 4 additional patients, the same procedure was conducted at 5 min, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, and 5 h after injection. On the basis of the data for these 4 patients (mean injected dose, 231 MBq), the radiation exposure of a Ga-68-PSMA-617 PET/CT was identified. Results: Intense tracer uptake was observed in the kidneys and salivary glands. In 14 of 19 patients (73.7%), at least 1 lesion suspected of being a tumor was detected at 3 h after injection. Of 53 representative tumor lesions selected at 3 h after injection, 47 lesions were visible at 1 h after injection. The mean tumor-to-background ratio for maximum standardized uptake value was 20.4 +/- 17.3 (range, 2.3-84.0) at 1 h after injection and 38.2 +/- 38.6 (range, 3.6-154.3) at 3 h after injection. The average radiation exposure (effective dose) was approximately 0.021 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: Within healthy organs, the kidneys and salivary glands showed the highest Ga-68-PSMA-617 uptake. The radiation exposure was relatively low. Ga-68-PSMA-617 shows PCa lesions with high contrast. Images obtained between 2 and 3 h after injection seem to be the best option with regard to radiotracer uptake and tumor contrast. Later images can help to clarify unclear lesions.

We prepared (-)-[C-11]OMV by a palladium-promoted cross-coupling reaction using [C-11]methyl iodide, in a radiochemical yield of 38 +/- 6.9% (n = 3), a radiochemical purity of 98 +/- 2.3% (n = 5), and a specific activity of 11 +/- 7.0 TBq/mmol at 30 minutes after EOB (n = 5). Then, we evaluated in vivo whether (-)-[C-11]OMV has properties as a PET radioligand for mapping VAChT. In rats, the brain uptake of (-)-[C-11]OMV was 1.1%ID/g at 5 minutes postinjection, and was retained of a high level for 60 minutes. The brain uptake was significantly inhibited by the co-injection (500 nmol/kg) of cold (-)-OMV (58-66%), (-)-vesamicol (57-65%), and two sigma receptor ligands with modulate affinities for VAChTs: SA4503 (56-71%) and haloperidol (39-64%) in all of the brain regions, including the cerebellum with a low density of VAChTs, but not of sigma(1)-selective ligand (+)-pentazocine. However, the pretreatment with a large excess amount of (+/-)-pentazocine (50 mu mol/kg) reduced the uptake in a different manner in the brain regions: 25% reduction in the striatum with a high density of VAChTs, and a 50-55% reduction in the other regions with a lower density of VAChTs. Ex vivo autoradiography using (-)-[C-11]OMV showed a similar regional brain distribution of [H-3](-)-vesamicol. In the PET study of the monkey brain, the regional brain distribution pattern of (-)-[C-11]OMV was different from that of [(11)]SA4503. The uptake of (-)[C-11]OMV was relatively higher in the striatum, was reversible, and an apparent equilibrium state was found at 20-40 minutes. In conclusion, (-)-[C-11]OMV exhibited appropriate brain kinetics during the time frame of C-11-labeled tracers and bound mainly to VAChTs; however, the binding to sigma(1) receptors was not disregarded. Therefore, (-)-[C-11]OMV-PET together with help of [C-11]SA4503-PET may evaluate VAChTs.

However, potential adverse effects, including insomnia, hampered the clinical use of these drugs, possibly due to their persistent interaction with the target molecules. The purpose of the present study was to estimate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of enerisant, a novel antagonist and inverse agonist for histamine H-3 receptors. Methods To measure the histamine H-3 receptor occupancy by enerisant, positron emission tomography studies using [C-11]TASP457, a specific radioligand for histamine H-3 receptors, were performed in 12 healthy men at baseline and at 2 h after oral administration of enerisant hydrochloride. For three of these subjects, two additional scans were performed at 6 and 26 h after the administration. Relationships between the receptor occupancy by enerisant and its dose and plasma concentrations were then analyzed. Results Administration of enerisant hydrochloride decreased the radioligand binding in a dose-dependent manner. The estimated receptor occupancy values at 2 h varied as a function of its dose or plasma concentration. The time course of the occupancy showed persistently high levels (> 85%) in the two subjects with higher doses (25 and 12.5 mg). The occupancy was also initially high at 2 h and 6 h with the lower dose of 5 mg, but it decreased to 69.7% at 26 h. Conclusion The target engagement of enerisant was demonstrated in the brains of living human subjects. The occupancy of histamine H-3 receptors by enerisant at 2 h can be predicted by applying the plasma concentration of enerisant to Hill's plot. The preliminary time-course investigation showed persistently high brain occupancy with high doses of enerisant despite the decreasing plasma concentration of the drug. Five milligrams or less dose would be appropriate for the treatment for narcolepsy with initially high occupancy allowing for effective treatment of narcolepsy, and then the occupancy level would be expected to decrease to a level to avoid this drug's unwanted side effect of insomnia at night, although further research is warranted to confirm the statement since the expected decrease is based on the finding in one subject.

For these patients, Lutetium-177 (Lu-177) radioligand therapy targeting the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has gained increasing interest with promising outcome data. Patient-individualized dosimetry enables improvement of therapy success with the aim of minimizing absorbed dose to organs at risk while maximizing absorbed dose to tumors. Different dosimetric approaches with varying complexity and accuracy exist for this purpose. The Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) formalism applied to tumors assumes a homogeneous activity distribution in a sphere with unit density for derivation of tumor S values (TSV). Voxel S value (VSV) approaches can account for heterogeneous activities but are simulated for a specific tissue. Full patient-individual Monte Carlo (MC) absorbed dose simulation addresses both, heterogeneous activity and density distributions. Subsequent CT-based density weighting has the potential to overcome the assumption of homogeneous density in the MIRD formalism with TSV and VSV methods, which could be a major limitation for the application in bone metastases with heterogeneous density. The aim of this investigation is a comparison of these methods for bone lesion dosimetry in mCRPC patients receiving Lu-177-PSMA therapy. Results In total, 289 bone lesions in 15 mCRPC patients were analyzed. Percentage difference (PD) of average absorbed dose per lesion compared to MC, averaged over all lesions, was + 14 +/- 10% (min: - 21%; max: + 56%) for TSVs. With lesion-individual density weighting using Hounsfield Unit (HU)-to-density conversion on the patient's CT image, PD was reduced to - 8 +/- 1% (min: - 10%; max: - 3%). PD on a voxel level for three-dimensional (3D) voxel-wise dosimetry methods, averaged per lesion, revealed large PDs of + 18 +/- 11% (min: - 27%; max: + 58%) for a soft tissue VSV approach compared to MC; after voxel-wise density correction, this was reduced to - 5 +/- 1% (min: - 12%; max: - 2%). Conclusion Patient-individual MC absorbed dose simulation is capable to account for heterogeneous densities in bone lesions. Since the computational effort prevents its routine clinical application, TSV or VSV dosimetry approaches are used.

In the present study, we describe a multistage virtual screening approach that identifies dual adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor antagonists using deep learning, pharmacophore models, and molecular docking methods. Nineteen hits from the ChemDiv library containing 1,178,506 compounds were selected and further tested by in vitro assays (cAMP functional assay and radioligand binding assay); of these hits, two compounds (C8 and C9) with 1,2,4-triazole scaffolds possessing the most potent binding affinity and antagonistic activity for A(1)/A(2A) ARs at the nanomolar level (pK(i) of 7.16-7.49 and pIC(50) of 6.31-6.78) were identified. Further molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested similarly strong binding interactions of the complexes between the A(1)/A(2A) ARs and two compounds (C8 and C9). Notably, the 1,2,4-triazole derivatives (compounds C8 and C9) were identified as the most potent dual A(1)/A(2A) AR antagonists in our study and could serve as a basis for further development. The effective multistage screening approach developed in this study can be utilized to identify potent ligands for other drug targets. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Dual adenosine A(1)/A(2A) receptor antagonists provide a possible effective therapy that can simultaneously solve motor symptoms and nonmotor symptoms in the medical treatment of PD. Here, we applied a multistage virtual screening approach involving deep learning, pharmacophore models, and molecular docking methods to the ChemDiv library, which contains 1,178,506 compounds, and identified two 1,2,4-triazole derivatives as dual adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor antagonists. We used a cAMP functional assay and radioligand binding assay to evaluate the biological activity and binding affinities towards adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor of 8 selected compounds, respectively. The molecular dynamics (MD) simulations showed similarly strong binding interactions of the complexes between the adenosine A(1)/A(2A) receptors and the compounds. The results showed that the multistage virtual screening approach can effectively identify potent dual adenosine A(1)/A(2A) receptor antagonists. The multistage screening approach offers an alternative and effective strategy for the identification of potent ligands for other drug targets.

Recently developed albumin-binding PSMA radioligands showed a remarkably increased tumor uptake because of the enhanced blood circulation, but higher accumulation of activity was also observed in off-target organs and tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the option of using fast-cleared, small-molecular-weight PSMA inhibitors (PSMA-11, 2-PMPA, and ZJ-43) to reduce the kidney uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56, a previously developed albumin-binding PSMA radioligand. Dual-isotope SPECT/CT imaging was performed with tumor-bearing mice coinjected with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 and a 2.5-fold molar excess of [Ga-67]Ga-PSMA-11. At early timepoints after injection, the high renal uptake of [Ga-67]Ga-PSMA-11 reduced the accumulation of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 in the kidneys substantially, whereas the tumor uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was only slightly affected. These findings were confirmed in biodistribution studies, which revealed reduced uptake of F 7 Liau-PSMA-ALB-56 in the kidneys due to coadministered unlabeled PSMA-11 (9.1 +/- 0.8% IA/g vs 46 +/- 11% IA/g; 1 h p.i.). The tumor uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 was almost the same at 1 h p.i., irrespective of whether or not PSMA-11 was coinjected (24 +/- 6% IA/g vs 27 +/- 7% IA/g). The application of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 with 2-PMPA or ZJ-43, respectively, showed similar results in biodistribution studies. Among all three tested PSMA inhibitors, 2-PMPA, applied at a 2.5-fold molar excess relative to [Lu-177]Lu- PSMA-ALB-56, was most effective to improve the tumor-to-kidney ratios over the first hours after injection of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56. The concept of using a PSMA inhibitor together with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-ALB-56 appears promising in view of a clinical translation of this and possibly other long-circulating PSMA radioligands.

Methods Following institutional review board approval and informed consent, nine patients with mCRPC were recruited. Four patients accepted intravenous injection of 0.80-1.1GBq (21.5-30 mCi) of Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617, then underwent serial whole-body planar and SPECT/CT imaging at 2, 24, 72, 120 and 168 h. The other five patients accepted intravenous injection of 1.30-1.42GBq (35-38.4 mCi) Lu-177-PSMA-617, then underwent the same imaging procedures at 0.5, 2, 24, 48, and 72h. All patients were evaluated by Ga-68-PSMA-617 PET/CT before and one month after the treatment. Dosimetry evaluation was compared in both patient groups. Results When the bone metastasis tumors with comparable baseline SUVmax in the range of 10.0-15.0 were selected from the two groups for comparison, the accumulated radioactivity of Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617 was about 3.02-fold higher than that of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Imaging dose of Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617 treatment showed significant decrease of Ga-68-PSMA-617 uptake within a month, which was not observed in patients imaged with Lu-177-PSMA-617 (SUV change: -32.430.14% vs. 0.21 +/- 0.37%; P = 0.002). Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617 also had higher absorbed doses in the red bone marrow and kidneys than Lu-177-PSMA-617 (0.0547 +/- 0.0062 vs. 0.0084 +/- 0.0057mSv/MBq for red bone marrow, P < 0.01; 2.39 +/- 0.69 vs. 0.39 +/- 0.06 mSv/MBq for kidneys, P < 0.01). Conclusion This first-in-human study demonstrated that Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617 had higher accumulation in mCRPC and that low imaging dose appears to be effective in treating tumors with high Ga-68-PSMA-617 uptakes. Elevated uptakes of Lu-177-EB-PSMA-617 in kidneys and red bone marrow were well tolerated at the administered low dose. Further investigations with increased dose and frequency of administration are warranted.

Expression of various purinoceptor subtypes in the rat ARC and physiological studies suggest a modulatory function of P2 receptors within the neuroglial ARC circuitry. A differentiated mixed neuronal and glial microculture was therefore established from postnatal rat ARC, revealing neuronal expression of ARC-specific transmitters involved in food intake regulation (neuropeptide Y (NPY), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)). Some NPYergic neurons cosynthesized TH, while POMC and TH expression proved to be mutually exclusive. Stimulation with the general purinoceptor agonists 2-methylthioadenosine-5'triphosphate (2-MeSATP) and ATP but not the P2X1/P2X3 receptor subtype agonist alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine-5'triphosphate (alpha,beta-meATP) induced intracellular calcium signals in ARC neurons and astrocytes. Some 5-10% each of 2-MeSATP responsive neurons expressed POMC, NYP or TH. Supporting the calcium imaging data, radioligand binding studies to hypothalamic membranes showed high affinity for 2-MeSATP, ATP but not alpha,beta-meATP to displace [alpha-S-35] deoxyadenosine-5'thiotriphosphate ([S-35]dATP-alpha S) from P2 receptors. Repetitive superfusion with equimolar 2-MeSATP allowed categorization of ARC cells into groups with a high or low (LDD) degree of purinoceptor desensitization, the latter allowing further receptor characterization. Calcium imaging experiments performed at 37 degrees C vs. room temperature showed further reduction of desensitization. Agonist-mediated intracellular calcium signals were suppressed in all LDD neurons but only 25% of astrocytes in the absence of extracellular calcium, suggestive of metabotropic P2Y receptor expression in the majority of ARC astrocytes. The highly P2Y(1)-selective receptor agonists MRS2365 and 2-methylthioadenosine-5'diphosphate (2-MeSADP) activated 75-85% of all 2-MeSATP-responsive ARC astrocytes. Taking into consideration the high potency to dose-dependently stimulate ARC cells of the LDD group, the high affinity for rat P2X(1-3) and low affinity for rat P2X4, P2X7 and P2Y receptor subtypes except P2Y(1) and P2Y(13), the agonist 2-MeSATP primarily acted upon P2X2 and P2Y(1) purinoceptors to trigger intracellular calcium signaling in ARC neurons and astrocytes.

High affinity binding of [H-3]LY341495 to recombinant human group II mGlu receptors (mGlu2 and mGlu3), and in rat brain homogenates (K-d similar to 1 nM), has been previously described. Although LY341495 is a very selective nM-potent antagonist for group II mGlu receptors, it is also a relatively potent antagonist for group III mGlu receptors at high nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations. In this study we examined and characterized the binding of [H-3]LY341495 to membranes of cells expressing recombinant human group III mGlu receptors. Using up to 100 nM of [H-3]LY341495, the level of specific binding in human mGlu4a receptor-expressing cell membranes was not appreciable and binding to this site was not examined further. In contrast, we demonstrated sufficient specific binding of [H-3]LY341495 to human mGlu6, mGlu7a and mGlu8a receptor-expressing cell membranes to allow for further characterizations. [H-3]LY341495 binding was saturable and rapidly reversible. [H-3]LY341495 bound to a single site in each cell line, with K-d and B-max values of 31.6+/-6.8 nM and 3.3+/-0.7 pmol/mg protein (mGlu6), 72.7+/-22.0 nM and 3.7+/-0.4 pmol/mg protein (mGlu8a), and 14.0+/-1.1 nM and 3.0+/-0.2 pmol/mg protein (mGlu8a), [H-3]LY341495 binding to mGlu6, 7a and 7a was displaceable by compounds which interact functionally with group III mGlu receptors. For example, L-AP4 displaced [H-3]LY341495 with Ki values of 6.8+/-3.1 muM (mGlu6), 211+/-43 muM (mGlu7a) and 1.6+/-0.3 muM (mGlu8a). With L-glutamate, we obtained K-i values of 12.3+/-3.5, 869+/-154 and 4.5+/-0.83 muM, for mGlu6, mGlu7a and mGlu8a, respectively. K-i values for unlabelled LY341495 were 0.058+/-0.008, 0.22+/-0.05 and 0.029+/-0.008 muM, respectively. These studies demonstrated that [H-3]LY341495 is a useful radioligand for studying the pharmacology and expression of recombinant mGlu6, 7a and 8a receptors in cell lines.

Using iodine-123 labelled VIP, the newly employed diagnostic procedure termed VIP receptor scintigraphy (VIP-RS) appears to detect tumour tissue, especially pancreatic metastatic tumours, in almost all cases. So far, however, only a single centre has demonstrated convincing positive results. The aim of this study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of VIP-RS with those of computer tomography (CT) and transabdominal ultrasound in patients with extensive pancreatic metastatic adenocarcinomas and neuroendocrine tumours, VIP was radiolabelled with carrier-free I-123 using the chloramine T-method and preparative high-performance liquid chromatography for purification. Patients with metastatic pancreatic (n=12) and colorectal (n=3) carcinomas (adenocarcinoma: n=13, neuroendocrine tumour: n=2) were studied by VIP-RS, CT, ultrasound and, in one case, also by radioligand receptor autoradiography. Carrier-free radioiodinated VIP of maximum specific radioactivity maintained a high biological activity as determined by cAMP formation in receptor-expressing tumour cell lines. Intravenous injection of I-123-VIP did not cause any side-effects. Biodistribution, determined over 24 h. was high in the lungs and low in abdominal organs. Although all patients had extensive metastatic disease as evidenced by CT and ultrasound, VIP-RS was unable to detect either primaries or metastases in these patients. Only in two patients could a significant uptake of radiolabel be detected in organs directly infiltrated by the primary. To exclude false-negative findings, tumour tissue in one patient with a large primary, undetectable by VIP-RS, was analysed by radioligand receptor autoradiography and shown to be receptor positive. Moreover, in vitro receptor determinations showed that pancreatic carcinomas usually have fewer VIP receptors than the normal tissues to which they metastasize, like the liver, It is concluded that VIP can be radioactively labelled with maximum specific radioactivity while maintaining biological activity. Intravenous administration leads to a biodistribution almost identical to that reported previously. However, in contrast to these reports, very low sensitivity and specificity were observed for the detection of pancreatic cancers. In retrospect, these findings are not surprising since VIP receptor expression was observed to be higher in normal tissues than in neoplastic ones.

PDE10A is expressed on striatal neurones in basal ganglia where other known molecular targets are enriched such as dopamine D-2/3 receptors (D-2/3 R). The aim of this study was to examine the availability of PDE10A enzyme in relation with age and gender and to compare those changes with those related to D-2/3 R and volumes in different regions of the basal ganglia. As a secondary objective we examined the relative distribution of D-2/3 R and PDE1OA enzyme in the striatum and globus pallidus. Forty control subjects (20F/20M; age: 44 +/- 11y, age range 27-69) from an ongoing positron emission tomography (PET) study in HD gene expansion carriers were included. Subjects were examined with PET using the high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) and with 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The PDE10A radioligand F-18-MNI-659 and D-2/3 R radioligand C-11-raclopride were used. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND) estimated with the two-tissue compartment model (F-18-MNI-659) and the simplified reference tissue model (C-11-raclopride) using the cerebellum as reference region. The PET data were corrected for partial volume effects. In the striatum, PDE10A availability showed a significant age-related decline that was larger compared to the age-related decline of D-2/3 R availability and to the age-related decline of volumes measured with MRI. In the globus pallidus, a less pronounced decline of PDE10A availability was observed, whereas D-2/3 R availability and volumes seemed to be rather stable with aging. The distribution of the PDE10A enzyme was different from the distribution of D-2/3 R, with higher availability in the globus pallidus. These results indicate that aging is associated with a considerable physiological reduction of the availability of PDE10A enzyme in the striatum. Moreover as result of the analysis, in the striatum for both the molecular targets, we observed a gender effect with higher BPND the female group.

A heterodimeric [RGD-Glu-[<SUP>64</SUP>Cu-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2] α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>/GRPr-targeting antagonist radiotracer for PET imaging of prostate tumors	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Gastrin-releasing peptide; Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Bombesin; Prostate cancer; Copper-64	HUMAN BREAST-CANCER; IN-VIVO EVALUATION; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; PEPTIDE RECEPTORS; TARGETING VECTOR; RGD PEPTIDES; MOUSE MODEL; BOMBESIN; EXPRESSION; MICROPET	Introduction: In the present study, we describe a Cu-64-radiolabeled heterodimeric peptide conjugate for dual alpha(v)beta(3)/GRPr (alpha(v)beta(3) integrin/gastrin releasing peptide receptor) targeting of the form [RGD-Glu-[Cu-64-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2] (RGD: the amino acid sequence [Arg-Gly-Asp], a nonregulatory peptide used for alpha(v)beta(3) integrin receptor targeting; Glu: glutamic acid; NO2A: 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid; 6-Ahx: 6-amino hexanoic acid; and RM2: (D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2), an antagonist analogue of bombesin (BBN) peptide used for GRPr targeting). Methods: RGD-Glu-6Ahx-RM21 was conjugated to a NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) complexing agent to produce [RGD-Glu-[NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2], which was purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and characterized by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Radiolabeling of the conjugate with Cu-64 produced [RGD-Glu-[64Cu-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2 in high radiochemical yield (>= 95%). In vivo behavior of the radiolabeled peptide conjugate was investigated in normal CF-1 mice and in the PC-3 human prostate cancer experimental model. Results: A competitive displacement receptor binding assay in human prostate PC-3 cells using I-125-[Tyr(4)]BBN as the radioligand showed high binding affinity of [RGD-Glu-[Cu-nat-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM21 conjugate for the GRPr (3.09 +/- 0.34 nM). A similar assay in human, glioblastoma U87-MG cells using I-125-Echistatin as the radioligand indicated a moderate receptor-binding affinity for the alpha(v)beta(3) integrin (518 +/- 37.5 nM). In vivo studies of [RGD-Glu-[Cu-64-NO2A]-6-Ahx-RM2] showed high accumulation (4.86 +/- 1.01 %ID/g, 1 h post-intravenous injection (p.i.)) and prolonged retention (4.26 +/- 1.23 %ID/g, 24 h p.i.) of tracer in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice. Micro-positron emission tomography (microPET) molecular imaging studies produced high-quality, high contrast images in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice at 4 h p.i. Conclusions: The favorable pharmacokinetics and enhanced tumor uptake of Cu-64-NOTA-RGD-Glu-6Ahx-RM2 warrant further investigations for dual integrin and GRPr-positive tumor imaging and possible radiotherapy.

Therefore, the brain kinetics of I-123-5-I-R91150 (4-amino-N-[1-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)propyl]-4-methylpiperidin-4-yl]-5-iodo-2-methoxy-benzamide) and the influence of ketamine on the postsynaptic serotonin-2A receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine-2A, or 5-HT2A) status were investigated in cats using micro-SPECT. Methods: This study was conducted on 6 cats using the radioligand I-123-5-I-R91150, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, as the imaging probe. Anesthesia was induced and maintained with a continuous-rate infusion of propofol (8.4 +/- 1.2 mg kg(-1) followed by 0.22 mg kg(-1) min(-1)) 75 min after tracer administration, and acquisition of the first image began 15 min after induction of anesthesia. After this first acquisition, propofol (0.22 mg kg(-1) min(-1)) was combined with ketamine (5 mg kg(-1) followed by 0.023 mg kg(-1) min(-1)), and the second acquisition began 15 min later. Semiquantification, with the cerebellum as a reference region, was performed to calculate the 5-HT2A receptor binding indices (parameter for available receptor density) in the frontal and temporal cortices. The binding indices were analyzed with Wilcoxon signed ranks statistics. Results: The addition of ketamine to the propofol continuous-rate infusion resulted in decreased binding indices in the right frontal cortex (1.25 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.16; P = 0.028), left frontal cortex (1.34 +/- 0.15 vs. 1.49 +/- 0.10; P = 0.028), right temporal cortex (1.30 +/- 0.17 vs. 1.45 +/- 0.09; P = 0.046), and left temporal cortex (1.41 +/- 0.20 vs. 1.52 +/-. 0.20; P = 0.046). Conclusion: This study showed that cats can be used as an animal model for studying alterations of the 5-HT2A receptor status with I-123-5-I-R91150 micro-SPECT. Furthermore, an interaction between ketamine and the 5-HT2A receptors resulting in decreased binding of I-123-5-I-R91150 in the frontal and temporal cortices was demonstrated. Whether the decreased radioligand binding resulted from a direct competition between ketamine and I-123-5-I-R91150 or from a decreased affinity of the 5-HT2A receptor caused by ketamine remains to be elucidated.

Quantification of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]GB67 binding to cardiac α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors with positron emission tomography:: validation in pigs	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						alpha(1)-adrenoceptors; [C-11] GB67; myocardium; pig; positron emission tomography (PET)	ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR DENSITY; MYOCARDIAL ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTORS; HUMAN HEART; HYPERTROPHY; PET; BLOOD; SUBTYPES; RADIOLIGANDS; KINETICS; IMAGES	Introduction An increase in human cardiac alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (alpha(1)-AR) density is associated with various diseases such as myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and hypertension. Positron emission tomography (PET) with an appropriate radioligand offers the possibility of imaging receptor function in the normal and diseased heart. [C-11]GB67, an analogue of prazosin, has been shown in rats to have potential as a PET ligand with high selectivity to alpha(1)-AR. However, alpha(1)-AR density is up to ten times higher in rat heart compared to that in man. The aim of the present preclinical study was to extend the previous evaluation to a large mammal heart, where the alpha(1)-AR density is comparable to man, and to validate a method for quantification before PET studies in man. Methods Seven [C-11]GB67 PET studies, with weight-adjusted target dose of either 5.29 MBq kg(-1) (pilot, test-retest and baseline-predose studies) or 8.22 MBq kg(-1) (baseline-displacement studies), were performed in four anaesthetised pigs (39.5 +/- 3.9 kg). Total myocardial volume of distribution (V-T) was estimated under different pharmacological conditions using compartmental analysis with a radiolabelled metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function. A maximum possible blocking dose of 0.12 mu mol kg(-1) of unlabeled GB67 was given 20 min before [C-11]GB67 administration in the predose study and 45 min after administration of [C-11]GB67 in the displacement study. In addition, [O-15]CO (3,000 MBq) and [O-15]H2O, with weight adjusted target dose of 10.57 MBq kg(-1), were also administered for estimation of blood volume recovery (RC) of the left ventricular cavity and myocardial perfusion (MBF), respectively. Results [C-11]GB67 V-T values (in ml cm(-3)) were estimated to be 24.2 +/- 5.5 (range, 17.3-31.3), 10.1 (predose) and 11.6 (displacement). MBF did not differ within each pig, including between baseline and predose conditions. Predose and displacement studies showed that specific binding of [C-11]GB67 to myocardial alpha(1)-ARs accounts for approximately 50% of V-T. Conclusion The present study offers a methodology for using [C-11]GB67 as a radioligand to quantify human myocardial alpha(1)-ARs in clinical PET studies.

Evaluation of <SUP>134</SUP>Ce/<SUP>134</SUP>La as a PET Imaging Theranostic Pair for <SUP>225</SUP>Ac a-Radiotherapeutics	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						134Ce; 225Ac; targeted a-radiotherapy; PET imaging; PSMA-617; YS5 antibody	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; PROSTATE-CANCER; PSMA; BIODISTRIBUTION; LIGAND	225Ac-targeted a-radiotherapy is a promising approach to treating malignancies, including prostate cancer. However, a-emitting isotopes are difficult to image because of low administered activities and a low fraction of suitable y-emissions. The in vivo generator 134Ce/134La has been proposed as a potential PET imaging surrogate for the therapeu-tic nuclides 225Ac and 227Th. In this report, we detail efficient radiola-beling methods using the 225Ac-chelators DOTA and MACROPA. These methods were applied to radiolabeling of prostate cancer imag-ing agents, including PSMA-617 and MACROPA-PEG4-YS5, for evalu-ation of their in vivo pharmacokinetic characteristics and comparison to the corresponding 225Ac analogs. Methods: Radiolabeling was performed by mixing DOTA/MACROPA chelates with 134Ce/134La NH4OAc, pH 8.0, at room temperature, and radiochemical yields were monitored by radio-thin-layer chromatography. In vivo biodistri-butions of 134Ce-DOTA/MACROPA.NH2 complexes were assayed through dynamic small-animal PET/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistri-bution studies over 1 h in healthy C57BL/6 mice, compared with free 134CeCl3. In vivo, preclinical imaging of 134Ce-PSMA-617 and 134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 was performed on 22Rv1 tumor-bearing male nu/nu-mice. Ex vivo biodistribution was performed for 134Ce/225Ac-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 conjugates. Results: 134Ce-MACROPA.NH2 demonstrated near-quantitative labeling with 1:1 ligand-to-metal ratios at room temperature, whereas a 10:1 ligand-to-metal ratio and elevated temperatures were required for DOTA. Rapid urinary excre-tion and low liver and bone uptake were seen for 134Ce/225Ac-DOTA/ MACROPA. NH2 conjugates in comparison to free 134CeCl3 con-firmed high in vivo stability. An interesting observation during the radiolabeling of tumor-targeting vectors PSMA-617 and MACROPA-PEG4-YS5-that the daughter 134La was expelled from the chelate after the decay of parent 134Ce-was confirmed through radio-thin-layer chromatography and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chroma-tography. Both conjugates, 134Ce-PSMA-617 and 134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5, displayed tumor uptake in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice. The ex vivo biodistribution of 134Ce-MACROPA.NH2, 134Ce-DOTA and 134Ce-MACROPA-PEG4-YS5 corroborated well with the respective 225Ac-conjugates. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the PET imaging potential for 134Ce/134La-labeled small-molecule and antibody agents. The similar 225Ac and 134Ce/134La-chemical and pharmacoki-netic characteristics suggest that the 134Ce/134La pair may act as a PET imaging surrogate for 225Ac-based radioligand therapies.

Hazards of Using <i>Masking Protocols</i> When Performing Ligand Binding Assays: Lessons From the Sigma-1 and Sigma-2 Receptors	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						dextrallorphan; di-O-tolyl guanidine; equilibrium binding; masking; (+) pentazocine; sigma-1; sigma-2; TMEM97	IN-VITRO; MOLECULAR-CLONING; AFFINITY; RELEASE; SELECTIVITY; ANTAGONISTS; EXPRESSION; DOPAMINE; SA4503; PROBES	Sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors are emerging therapeutic targets. Although the molecular identity of the sigma-2 receptor has recently been determined, receptor quantitation has used, and continues to use, the sigma-1 selective agents (+) pentazocine or dextrallorphan to mask the sigma-1 receptor in radioligand binding assays. Here, we have assessed the suitability of currently established saturation and competition binding isotherm assays that are used to quantify parameters of the sigma-2 receptor. We show that whilst the sigma-1 receptor mask (+) pentazocine has low affinity for the sigma-2 receptor (K-i 406 nM), it can effectively compete at this site with [H-3] di-O-tolyl guanidine (DTG) at the concentrations frequently used to mask the sigma-1 receptor (100 nM and 1 mu M). This competition influences the apparent affinity of DTG and other ligands tested in this system. A more troublesome issue is that DTG can displace (+) pentazocine from the sigma-1 receptor, rendering it partly unmasked. Indeed, commonly used concentrations of (+) pentazocine, 100 nM and 1 mu M, allowed 37 and 11% respectively of sigma-1 receptors to be bound by DTG (300 nM), which could result in an overestimation of sigma-2 receptor numbers in assays where sigma-1 receptors are also present. Similarly, modelled data for 1 mu M dextrallorphan show that only 71-86% of sigma-1 receptors would be masked in the presence of 300 nM DTG. Therefore, the use of dextrallorphan as a masking agent would also lead to the overestimation of sigma-2 receptors in systems where sigma-1 receptors are present. These data highlight the dangers of using masking agents in radioligand binding studies and we strongly recommend that currently used masking protocols are not used in the study of sigma-2 receptors. In order to overcome these problems, we recommend the use of a cell line apparently devoid of sigma-1 receptors [e.g., MCF7 (ATCC HTB-22)] in the absence of any masking agent when determining the affinity of agents for the sigma-2 receptor. In addition, assessing the relative levels of sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors can be achieved using [H-3] DTG saturation binding followed by two-site analysis of (+) pentazocine competition binding with [H-3] DTG.

J	Hanafy, A; Langguth, P; Spahn-Langguth, H				Hanafy, A; Langguth, P; Spahn-Langguth, H			Pretreatment with potent P-glycoprotein ligands may increase intestinal secretion in rats	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						P-glycoprotein; pharmacokinetics; intestinal permeability; induction; intestinal perfusion	RADIOLIGAND-BINDING ASSAY; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE GENE; SUBSTRATE RECOGNITION; DRUG-RESISTANCE; CANCER-CELLS; CMOAT MRP2; EXPRESSION; INDUCTION; VERAPAMIL; PERMEABILITY	The expression of P-glycoprotein is induced in cell cultures upon exposure to various inducers. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in-vivo relevance of this observation, i.e, the influence of chronic pretreatments with selected drugs - all of which are ligands to P-glycoprotein (P-gp) as demonstrated in radioligand binding studies and all of which have some or a considerable effect on P-gp expression in Caco-2 cells - on the effective intestinal permeabilities of the model compound talinolol in rats employing in-situ single-pass intestinal perfusion of three different gut segments. Talinolol was selected, because it shows high selectivity for one of the exsorptive transporters (P-gp) and its intestinal permeability is very sensitive to changes in exsorption when the perfusate concentration is low. Prior to the induction study the perfusion model was optimized regarding the type and concentration of a competitive inhibitor which may be used to block the exsorption-related permeability reduction (through intestinal exsorption) during an ongoing perfusion and would permit an intra-individual comparison of the effective permeability without and with blockade of exsorption. While repetitive verapamil and talinolol dosing had no statistically significant exsorption-inducing effect, vinblastine and rifampicin pretreatments resulted in decreased intestinal talinolol permeabilities in the three tested gut segments, duodenum, jejunum, and colon [e.g., S-talinolol in jejunum: control, 2.50X10(-4) cm/s; vinblastine induction, 1.48X10(-4) cm/s (P < 0.05); rifampicin induction, 1.51x10(-4) cm/s (P < 0.05)]. Addition of an efficient secretion inhibitor (vinblastine) to the perfusate permitted the determination of the impact of inhibitable secretory processes on the total effective permeabilities and an estimation of passive permeability in the respective individual. The inhibitable permeability fractions were higher for vinblastine than for any other pretreatment and the difference from control pretreatment was statistically significant for all intestinal segments (duodenum, 61.8%; jejunum, 63.1%; colon, 43,7%; S-talinolol). Statistically significant differences were also detected for rifampicin in the perfused duodenum and jejunum (33.1 and 27.5% increase in inhibitable fraction, respectively, for S-talinolol). These differences are explained by a significant induction of outside-directed transport in the intestinal enterocytes by vinblastine and rifampicin. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

In total, 15 benzimidazole carbamates were synthesized and tested for their inhibition of human cholines-terases, also with regard to their pseudoirreversible binding mode and affinity toward both cannabinoid receptors in radioligand binding studies. After evaluation in a calcium mobilization assay as well as a beta-arrestin 2 (beta arr2) recruitment assay, two compounds with balanced activities on both targets were tested for their immunomodulatory effect on microglia activation and regarding their pharmacokinetic properties and blood-brain barrier pene-tration. Compound 15d, containing a dimethyl carbamate motif, was further evaluated in vivo, showing prevention of A beta 25-35-induced learning impairments in a pharmacological mouse model of Alzheimer's disease for both short-and long-term memory responses. Additional combination studies proved a synergic effect of BChE inhibition and CB2R activation in vivo.	[Spatz, Philipp; Steinmueller, Sophie A.

Imaging Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 In Vivo with 18F-Labeled Positron Emission Tomography Ligand	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DISEASE-ASSOCIATED MUTATIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; LRRK2 EXPRESSION; HIGHLY POTENT; DISCOVERY; BRAIN; INHIBITOR; PROTEIN; MODEL; NEURODEGENERATION	Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) has been demonstrated to be closely involved in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), and pharmacological blockade of LRRK2 represents a new opportunity for therapeutical treatment of PD and other related neurodegenerative conditions. The development of an LRRK2-specific positron emission tomography (PET) ligand would enable a target occupancy study in vivo and greatly facilitate LRRK2 drug discovery and clinical translation as well as provide a molecular imaging tool for studying physiopathological changes in neurodegenerative diseases. In this work, we present the design and development of compound 8 (PF-06455943) as a promising PET radioligand through a PET-specific structure-activity relationship optimization, followed by comprehensive pharmacology and ADME/neuroPK characterization. Following an efficient 18F-labeling method, we have confirmed high brain penetration of [18F]8 in nonhuman primates (NHPs) and validated its specific binding in vitro by autoradiography in postmortem NHP brain tissues and in vivo by PET imaging studies.

In the present study, per os (p.o.) administration (40mgkg(-1)) of the closely related analogue UCPH-102 in rats yielded respective plasma and brain concentrations of 10.5 and 6.67m after 1h. Three analogue series were designed and synthesized to improve the bioavailability profile of UCPH-102, but none displayed substantially improved properties in this respect. Invitro profiling of UCPH-102 (10m) at 51 central nervous system targets in radioligand binding assays strongly suggests that the compound is completely selective for EAAT1. Finally, in a rodent locomotor model, p.o. administration of UCPH-102 (20mgkg(-1)) did not induce acute effects or any visible changes in behavior.	[Haym, Isabell; Huynh, Tri H.

The synthetic approach used to obtain PSS232 and the radiolabeling precursor mesylate is disclosed as well as the evaluation of the two geometrical isomers of PSS232. In vitro displacement assays showed higher binding affinity of the E-geometrical isomer (1 nM vs 15 nM, for Z-isomer), which was, for this reason, selected for radiolabeling. One-step radiolabeling conditions (K-222/F-18(-), DMSO, 95 degrees C, 10 min) to synthesize (E)-[F-18]- PSS232 from the mesylate via nucleophilic substitution are described. At ambient temperature, (E)-[F-18]-PSS232, with log D-7.4 value of 2.0, was chemically stable over six hours in the presence of sodium ascorbate as a radical scavenger.

The synthesized compounds proved to be potent and selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the mGlu receptor 2 (mGluR2) in a [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assay and were able to displace an mGluR2 PAM radioligand, which we had previously developed, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range. The most promising candidates were radiolabeled and subjected to biodistribution studies and radiometabolite analysis in rats. Preliminary small-animal PET (mu PET) studies in rats indicated that [C-11]20f binds specifically and reversibly to an mGluR2 allosteric site, strongly suggesting that it is a promising candidate for PET imaging of mGluR2 in the brain.

[C-11]-ABP688 is clinically the most successful mGluR5 positron emission tomography (PET) tracer to date and it allows visualization and quantification of mGluR5. Due to the short half-life of carbon-11, clinical use of [C-11]-ABP688 is limited to facilities with an on-site cyclotron and a fluorine-18 (half-life 110 min) analogue would be more practical. Based on the [C-11]-ABP688 structural motif, a novel derivative [F-18]-PSS223 was prepared and evaluated as a PET tracer for imaging of mGluR5 in vitro and in vivo. Our results show favourable in vitro binding properties; however rapid defluorination of [F-18]-PSS223 does not allow visualization of mGluR5 in the rat brain.

Despite this success, only a small number of the over 400 known nonodorant GPCRs are currently targeted, suggesting there is still untapped therapeutic potential. However, as most GPCRs were identified based on their sequence homology to other members of the superfamily, many still remain "orphan" receptors without known ligands. Indeed, even once a GPCR has been deorphanized, the receptor typically is still poorly characterized in terms of its pharmacology and biological functions, presenting a unique set of experimental challenges in order to define its therapeutic potential. We discuss some of these challenges and how they have been addressed in order to uncover the therapeutic potential of five recently deorphanized receptors that are activated by short-and long-chain free fatty acids.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel carbon-11 labeled pyridyl ethers: candidate ligands for in vivo imaging of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α4β2-nAChRs) in the brain with positron emission tomography	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; nAChR; PET; Radioligand	BINDING-SITES; PET; RADIOLIGANDS; ANALOGS; NOMENCLATURE; PHARMACOLOGY; AFFINITY; TARGETS; CELLS	The most abundant subtype of cerebral nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), alpha 4 beta 2, plays a critical role in various brain functions and pathological states. Imaging agents suitable for visualization and quantification of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs by positron emission tomography (PET) would present unique opportunities to define the function and pharmacology of the nAChRs in the living human brain. In this study, we report the synthesis, nAChR binding affinity, and pharmacological properties of several novel 3-pyridyl ether compounds. Most of these derivatives displayed a high affinity to the nAChR and a high subtype selectivity for alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR. Three of these novel nAChR ligands were radiolabeled with the positron-emitting isotope C-11 and evaluated in animal studies as potential PET radiotracers for imaging of cerebral nAChRs with improved brain kinetics.

Elevated serotonin transporter binding in depressed patients with Parkinson's disease:: A preliminary PET study with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]DASB	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; depression; serotonin transporter; positron emission tomography; [C-11]DASB	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HEALTHY HUMANS; BRAIN; DISORDER; EPISODES	This study investigated whether abnormalities in serotonin transporter binding occur in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with concurrent depression. We estimated serotonin transporter levels in seven clinically depressed early-stage PD patients and in seven healthy matched-control subjects during a single positron emission tomography (PET) scan with the serotonin transporter radioligand, [C-11]DASB. Depressed PD patients displayed a wide-spread increase (8-68%) in [C-11]DASB specific binding outside of the striatum, which was significant in dorsolateral (37%) and prefrontal (68%) cortices. Elevated [C-11]DASB binding was positively correlated with depressive symptoms but not with disease severity or duration. Compatible with recent PET/[C-11]DASB findings in major depression, the present preliminary data suggest that increased [C-11]DASB binding, possibly reflecting greater serotonin transporter density (up-regulation), might be a pathological feature of depression in Parkinson's disease-and possibly a characteristic of depressive illness in general.

These ligands, labeled with europiurn pyridine-bis-bipyridine cryptate or with Alexa 488,546,647 selectively bound to the vasopressin V-la and oxytocin receptors with high affinities and exhibited antagonistic properties. The affinities of several unlabeled ligands determined by our homogeneous assays on membrane preparations or on intact cells into 96- and 384-well plate formats were similar to those determined by usual radioligand binding methods. Compared to other binding assays, the polarization and HTRF binding assays are nonradiaoactive, therefore safer to perform, yet very sensitive and homogeneous, therefore easier and faster to automate.

Synthesis of novel lactam derivatives and their evaluation as ligands for the dopamine receptors, leading to a D<sub>4</sub>-selective ligand	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						dopamine ligands; arylpiperazines; cyclic amides; lactams; receptor selectivity.	PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ANTAGONISTS; BINDING	The preparation of some lactam (cyclic amide) derivatives bearing various phenylpiperazinylbutyl side chains attached to the amide nitrogen together with their dopamine receptor affinity study is described. The synthesis of the target compounds involved the preparation of the intermediate bromobutyl derivatives of the appropriate lactam followed by N-alkylation of the appropriate phenylpiperazines with these intermediates. Radioligand binding studies at D-2-D5 receptor subtypes and a functional calcium assay of the target compounds at D-2 and D-5 receptor subtypes were performed. All compounds, except 12a and 12b, showed selectivity towards the D-2-like receptor subtypes. Selectivity of the indolinone derivatives 11 a-d at the D-4 receptors was observed. Compound 11b exhibited a remarkable affinity to hD(4) receptors with K-i value of 0.04 +/- 0.02 nm and was > 43,000-fold selective over the hD(2) receptor. In the functional assay, all the active compounds were of antagonistic activity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Detection of dopamine receptor subtypes in the rat diaphragm	HEART & LUNG			English	Article							MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; LOCALIZATION; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; CLONING; RNA; GENE; D1; BINDING; CDNA	BACKGROUND: The administration of dopamine using an in vivo animal model has been shown to prevent and treat diaphragm fatigue. OBJECTIVE: With the knowledge that dopamine stimulates alpha- and beta-adrenergic and dopamine receptors, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether dopamine receptors are present in the diaphragm. In addition, if dopamine receptors-were detected, we would identify the class and subtype of dopamine receptors. METHOD: Radioligand binding studies and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiments were used. RESULTS: The receptor binding studies were unable to establish whether dopamine receptors were present in the diaphragm. However, highly sensitive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiments demonstrated that D-1-like receptors (D-1 and D-5 receptors) were detected in the diaphragm. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report the class and specific subtype of dopamine receptors found in the diaphragm. By identifying dopamine receptors in the diaphragm, we have a better understanding of the mechanisms by which dopamine treats and prevents diaphragm fatigue.

Compounds 1a and 1b were synthesized in multistep syntheses, starting from 1-benzyl-4-piperidone and tetramethoxysilane, respectively, and were isolated as the hydrochlorides 1a center dot HCl and 1b center dot HCl. ESI-MS studies of aqueous solutions of the silanol 1b and the corresponding disiloxane 14 at different pH values revealed a remarkable stability of 1b. The identities of 1a center dot HCl and 1b center dot HCl were established by elemental analyses and multinuclear NMR studies. The sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptor affinities of the C/Si analogues panamesine (1a) and sila-panamesine (1b) were determined in competitive radioligand receptor binding studies. It was shown that the C/Si exchange results in a 3-fold enhancement of sigma(1) receptor affinity.

MTSEA inhibited binding of the agonist, I-125-NDPalpha-MSH, and the antagonist, I-125-SHU9119, in a concentration-dependent manner. Pre-incubation of cells with either the agonist or antagonist protected from subsequent MTSEA inhibition of radioligand binding. Mutation of Cys130 in transmembrane helix 3 to alanine, whilst not affecting ligand binding, led to a complete loss of the inhibitory effect of MTSEA. Since other types of sulfhydryl-reactive reagents had no effect on ligand binding, we conclude that covalent modification of Cys130 by MTSEA disrupts ligand binding by neutralising a close-by negative charge, most likely on Asp126.

Three putative N-glycosylation sites Asn(60), Asn(112) and Asn(117) are present in the amino-terminal extracellular domain of the hCRLR. Tunicamycin dose-dependently inhibited the glycosylation of a myc-tagged hCRLR and in parallel specific [I-125]CGRP and -ADM, binding. Similarly, the double mutant myc-hCRLR(N60,112T) exhibited minimal N-glycosidase F sensitive glycosylation, presumably at the third Asn(117), and the cell surface expression and specific radioligand binding were impaired. Substitution of the Asn(117) by Thr abolished CGRP and ADM binding in the face of intact N-glycosylation and cell surface expression. (C) 2000 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

Feature-Based Molecular Networking for the Targeted Identification of G<sub>q</sub>-Inhibiting FR900359 Derivatives	JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS			English	Article							MASS-SPECTROMETRY; PROTEIN; DEPSIPEPTIDE; NOMENCLATURE	Both the soil bacterium Chromobacterium vaccinii and the bacterial endosymbiont Candidatus Burkholderia crenata of the plant Ardisia crenata are producers of FR900359 (FR). This cyclic depsipeptide is a potent and selective G(q) protein inhibitor used extensively to investigate the intracellular signaling of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). In this study, the metabolomes of both FR producers were investigated and compared using feature-based molecular networking (FBMN). As a result, 30 previously unknown FR derivatives were identified, one-third being unique to C. vaccinii. Guided by MS, a novel FR derivative, FR-6 (compound 1), was isolated, and its structure unambiguously established. In a whole-cell biosensing assay based on detection of dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) as readout for G(q) inhibition, FR-6 suppressed G(q) signaling with micromolar potency (pIC(50) = 5.56). This functional activity was confirmed in radioligand binding assays (pK(i) = 7.50). This work demonstrates the power of molecular networking, guiding the way to a novel G(q)-inhibiting FR derivative and underlining the potency of FR as a G(q) inhibitor.

Adenosine exerts its extracellular effects through four types of G-protein-coupled receptors: A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3). Adenosine acts as an important regulator of metabolic processes. In the brain adenosine mediates prominent neuroprotective functions via the adenosine A(1) receptor. Whereas the pharmacological characteristics of the rat and human adenosine A(1) receptor have been intensively studied, the mouse adenosine A(1) receptor has not yet been characterised. Accordingly, we have cloned the mouse brain adenosine A(1) receptor and present here a pharmacological characterisation of the mouse adenosine A(1) receptor using functional studies and radioligand binding assays. The results show that the binding affinities of several ligands for the mouse adenosine A(1) receptor are similar to the affinities for the rat and human adenosine A(1) receptor with some exceptions.

Synthesis and Characterization of a Cannabinoid Type 2 Receptor Photoactivated Prodrug	CHEMPHOTOCHEM			English	Article; Early Access						cannabinoid receptors; coumarin; drug delivery; photolysis; prodrugs	DERIVATIVES; ACTIVATION; CHROMENOPYRAZOLE; MECHANISM; RELEASE; LIGANDS; DESIGN; ACIDS	G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligand prodrugs that can be released on demand with spatiotemporal control are powerful chemical tools that can assist in elucidating the consequences of GPCR activation or blockade at precise locations and times both in vitro and in vivo. Cannabinoid receptor prodrugs are of interest from both a drug delivery perspective and as tools to unravel the potential for differential signaling responses to be produced from cannabinoid receptor populations in distinct subcellular locations. Herein, the development and characterization of a cannabinoid type 2 receptor agonist prodrug is described, based on a 4-diethylamino-coumarylidenemalononitrilemethyl (DEACM-MN) photo caging moiety linked via a carbonate to a chromenopyrazole cannabinoid ligand. This prodrug showed rapid photolysis with 450-455 nm light and good stability in biologically relevant buffer. The formation of various coumarin products alongside drug release was studied in different conditions. Radioligand binding assays were conducted with the prodrug, which revealed a significantly decreased human cannabinoid type 2 receptor binding affinity than the active chromenopyrazole parent ligand.

Commonly, ensemble-based measurements of radiolabeled substrate uptakes or transport currents inform on kinetic parameters of transporters. Here we describe a fluorescence-based functional assay for glutamate and aspartate transporters that provides single-transporter, single-transport cycle resolution using an archaeal elevator-type sodium and aspartate symporter Glt(Ph) as a model system. We prepare proteo-liposomes containing reconstituted purified Glt(Ph) transporters and an encapsulated periplasmic glutamate/aspartate-binding protein, PEB1a, labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores. We then surface-immobilize the proteo-liposomes and measure transport-dependent Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) efficiency changes over time using single-molecule Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The assay provides a 10-100 fold increase in temporal resolution compared to radioligand uptake assays. It also allows kinetic characterization of different transport cycle steps and discerns kinetic heterogeneities within the transporter population.

The - and -opioid receptor affinity of new guanidinylated analogues and their non-guanidinylated precursors was determined by the displacement radioligand binding experiments. Our results indicate that the guanidinylation of cyclic 1,4-ureidodeltorphin peptide analogues does not exhibit a uniform influence on the opioid receptor binding properties, similarly as reported earlier for some linear peptides. All analogues were also tested for their in vitro resistance to proteolysis during incubation with large excess of chymotrypsin, pepsin, and papain by means of mass spectroscopy. Guanidinylated ureidopeptides 1G-4G showed mixed agonist/ agonist properties and high enzymatic stability indicating their potential as therapeutic agents for treatment of pain.

Proteomic analysis of the androgen receptor via MS-compatible purification of biotinylated protein on streptavidin resin	PROTEOMICS			English	Article						Absolute SILAC; Androgen receptor; Cell biology; Prostate cancer; SILAC; Streptavidin	PROSTATE-CANCER; IN-VIVO; AFFINITY PURIFICATION; BINDING PEPTIDE; IDENTIFICATION; TANDEM; EXPRESSION; TAG; DIGESTION; TYROSINE	The strength of the streptavidin/biotin interaction poses challenges for the recovery of biotinylated molecules from streptavidin resins. As an alternative to high-temperature elution in urea-containing buffers, we show that mono-biotinylated proteins can be released with relatively gentle heating in the presence of biotin and 2% SDS/Rapigest, avoiding protein carbamylation and minimizing streptavidin dissociation. We demonstrate the utility of this mild elution strategy in two studies of the human androgen receptor (AR). In the first, in which formaldehyde cross-linked complexes are analyzed in yeast, a mass spectrometry-based comparison of the AR complex using SILAC reveals an association between the androgen-activated AR and the Hsp90 chaperonin, while Hsp70 chaperonins associate specifically with the unliganded complex. In the second study, the endogenous AR is quantified in the LNCaP cell line by absolute SILAC and MRM-MS showing approximately 127?000 AR copies per cell, substantially more than previously measured using radioligand binding.

Intravenous administration of CUMI-101 did not produce overt biologically or toxicologically significant adverse effects except transient hypoactivity immediately after dose in the mid- and high-dose groups, which is not considered to be a dose-limiting toxic effect. No adverse effects were observed in the low-dose group. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) is considered to be 44.05 mu g/kg for a single iv dose administration in rats. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was estimated to be 881 mu g/kg for a single iv dose administration. The Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRDOSE) estimates indicate the maximum permissible single-study dosage of [C-11]CUMI-101 in humans is 52 mCi with testes and urinary bladder as the critical organ for males and females, respectively.

[I-125]Spiro-I was prepared in 55-65% isolated radiochemical yield, with radiochemical purity of >99%, via iododestannylation of the corresponding tributyltin precursor. In receptor binding studies, Spiro-I displayed low nanomolar affinity for sigma(1) receptors (sigma(1): K-i = 2.75 +/- 0.12 nM; sigma(2): K-i = 340 nM) and high subtype selectivity (sigma(2)/sigma(1) = 124). Biodistribution in mice demonstrated relatively high concentration of radioactivity in organs known to contain sigma(1) receptors, including the lung, kidney, heart, spleen, and brain. Administration of haloperidol 5 min prior to injection of [I-125] Spiro-I significantly reduced the concentration of radioactivity in the above-mentioned organs. These findings suggest that the binding of [I-125] Spiro-I to sigma(1) receptors in vivo is specific.

To gain better understanding of the specificity and cellular mechanisms involved in estrogen-mediated neuroprotection, a mouse hippocampal neuronal cell line (HT22) was evaluated. Earlier reports indicated this cell line was devoid of ERs. Contrary to these findings, characterization of HT22 cells using RT-PCR, immunoblot, immunocytochemical, and radioligand binding techniques revealed endogenous expression of ER. The predominant subtype appeared to be ER alpha. with functional activity confirmed using an ERE-tk-luciferase assay. The ability of an ER antagonist, ICI-182780, to block the neuroprotective effects of estrogens confirmed ER was involved mechanistically in neuroprotection. In conclusion, HT22 cells express functional ER alpha or a closely related ER enabling this cell line to be used to profile estrogens for neuroprotective properties acting via an ER-dependent mechanism.

Fish were reared under a natural photoperiod in July and sampled eight times at 3 h intervals from 12:00 to 09:00 h. Plasma melatonin levels showed robust daily rhythms in both precocious males and immature females, with high and low levels during night and day, respectively. The affinity (K-d) and density (B-max) of melatonin binding sites in the brain also showed similar variations. There were significant positive correlations between the plasma melatonin levels and the K-d or the B-max in immature females and between the K-d and B-max values in both precocious males and immature females. These results indicate that melatonin binding sites in the brain showed daily variations under a natural photoperiod in masu salmon. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The molecular mechanism of glucocorticoid (GC) on 3AO cells was also studied. Methods The expression and regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor in 3AO cells was studied by utilizing radioligand binding assay and quantitative RT-PCR. Results High affinity and low capacity GR existed in 3AO cells, in addition, GR binding activity was down-regulated by Dex in a time-dependent manner, to a level about 28.34% of control following 24 hours treatment, with a concomitant decrease in GR mRNA. The induction of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) activity by Dex was reversed by RU486, a potent glucocorticoid antagonist. Conclusion In 3AO cells, functional GR which can be down-regulated by Dex at the protein and mRNA level, exists suggesting that the regulating effects of Dex on GR occur at least partially at the GR mRNA level, and that the cellular effects of Dex on 3AO cells might be mediated by GR.

While the MS04 and MS05 peptides bind with nanomolar and sub-nanomolar affinities to the wild type MC1 receptor, they bind only with micromolar affinities for the wild type MC3 receptor, thus being the hitherto most MC1 receptor selective ligands. Upon exchanging portions involving transmembrane regions TM1, TM2-3, and TM6-7 of the MC1 receptor with corresponding portions of the MC3 receptor both of these peptides showed major losses of affinities. By contrast exchanges involving TM4-5 did not appreciably affect the affinity of either MS04 or MS05. Our data suggest that the binding pocket for the MSO4-MSO5 MSH-peptides is located between TM1-3 and TM6-7 of the melanocortin receptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The purified radioprobe exhibited a specific activity of 2.15 TBq/mmol (58 Ci/mmol). The novelty of this compound is that it contains structurally modified tyrosine residue (2',6'-dimethyltyrosine, Dmt(1)) replacing tyrosine (Tyr(1)) at the N-terminus, and beta-methyl substituted phenylalanine (beta MePhe(3)) at the third position. As the configuration of beta MePhe(3) side-chain might be different due to diastereomerism, and accordingly can alter the biological activity, both unlabeled threo (2S,3R and 2R,3S) diastercomeric analogues were also prepared and included in this study. The affinity and selectivity (delta-opioid versus mu-opioid receptor) were evaluated by radioreceptor binding assays. Agonist or antagonist potencies were determined in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding experiments using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells selectively expressing delta- or I-L-opioid receptors. The equilibrium binding of the radiolabeled peptide derivative [H-3]Dmt-Tic-(2S,3R)beta MePhe-Phe to rat brain membranes was saturable and the Scatchard analysis indicated a single binding receptor-type specific opioid ligands showed the rank order of competitor's potency delta > mu > kappa, suggesting selective labeling of opioid delta-sites. In the functional tests, the (2S,3R) and (2R,3S) peptides exhibited partial agonist behaviour by weakly stimulating regulatory G-proteins in CHO cell 4 membranes transfected with different receptors. Both isomers were quite weak partial agonists at the delta-receptor and reasonable partial agonists at the mu-receptor, with a prevalence of (2S,3R) over (2R,3S) for the R-receptor. Consistent with these observations both stereomers competitively inhibited the stimulation of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding induced by the prototype delta-agonist peptide (pClPhe(4))-DPDPE in delta mCHO cell membranes, and still the (2S,3R) compound exerted more potent delta-antagonist effect. [H-3]Dmt-Tic-(2S,3R)beta MePhe-Phe represents a high affinity new radioligand and also constitute further example of the influence of P-methyl substitution on the potency and selectivity of TIPP analogues, thus becoming a valuable biochemical and pharmacological tool in opioid research.

We have recently evaluated the high-affinity (K-D=0.5 +/- 0.2 nM, log P=2.9) sigma-1 receptor radiotracer [F-18]1-(3-fluoropropyl)-4-(4-cyanophenoxymethyl)piperidine, [F-18]FPS, in humans. In contrast to appropriate kinetics exhibited in baboon brain, in the human CNS, [F-18]FPS does not reach pseudoequilibrium by 4 h, supporting the development of a lower-affinity tracer (Waterhouse RN, Nobler MS, Chang RC, Zhou Y, Morales O, Kuwabara H, et al. First evaluation of the sigma-1 receptor radioligand [F-18] 1-3-fluropropyl-4-((4-cyanophenoxy)-methyl)piperidine ([F-18]FPS) in healthy humans. Neuroreceptor Mapping 2004, July 15-18th, Vancouver, BC Canada 2004]. We describe herein the in vivo evaluation in rats of [F-18]1-(2-fluoroethyl)-4-[(4-cyanophenoxy)methyl]piperidine ([F-18]SFE) (K-D=5 nM, log P=2.4), a structurally similar, lower-affinity sigma-1 receptor radioligand. Methods: [F-18]SFE was synthesized (n =4) as previously described in good yield (54 +/- 6% EOB), high specific activity (2.1 +/- 0.6 Ci/mu mol EOS) and radiochemical purity (98 +/- 1%) and evaluated in awake adult male rats. Results: Similar to [18F]FPS, regional brain radioactivity concentrations [percentage of injected dose per grain of tissue (%ID/g), 15 min] for [F-18]SFE were highest in occipital cortex (1.86 +/- 0.06 %ID/g) and (rental cortex (1.76 +/- 0.38 %ID/g), and lowest in the hippocampus (1.01 +/- 0.02%ID/g). Unlike [F-18]-FPS, [F-18]SFE cleared from the brain with similar to 40% reduction in peak activity over a 90-min period. Metabolite analysis (1 h) revealed that [18F]SFE was largely intact in the brain. Blocking studies showed a large degree (> 80%) of saturable binding for [F-18]SFF. in discrete brain regions. Conclusions: We conclude that [F-18]SFE exhibits excellent characteristics in vivo and may provide a superior PET radiotracer for human studies due to its faster CNS clearance compared to [18F]FPS.

ZIKV infection causes severe neuroimmunopathology and is particularly harmful to the developing fetuses of infected pregnant women causing various developmental abnormalities. Currently, there are no effective methods of preventing or treating ZIKV infection, and new treatment options are urgently needed. Therefore, we have used an in vitro plaque assay to screen a limited proprietary library of small organic compounds and identified highly bioactive leads, with the most active analogs showing activity in low picomolar range. Identified "hits" possess certain common structural features that can be used in the design of the next generation(s) of ZIKV inhibitors. Collectively, our findings suggest that identified compounds represent excellent template(s) for the development of inexpensive and orally available anti-Zika drugs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The binding affinity was determined by the displacement of radioligand [H-3]MDL-105,519 from rat cortical membrane preparations. The most attractive structures in the search for prospective NMDA receptor ligands were identified to be 2-arylcarbonylmethyl substituted 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,2-benzothiazine-3-carboxylic acid 1,1-dioxides. It has been demonstrated for the first time that the replacement of NH group in the ligand by sp(3) CH2 is tolerated. This finding may pave the way for previously unexplored approaches for designing new ligands of the NMDA receptor.

The endogenous ligands human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and LH bind to the large N terminal domain of the receptor. We recently reported on the first radiolabeled low molecular weight (LMW) agonist for this receptor, [H-3]Org 43553, which was now used to screen for new LMW ligands. We identified a terphenyl derivative that inhibited [H-3]Org 43553 binding to the receptor, which led us to synthesize a number of derivatives. The most potent compound of this terphenyl series, 24 (LUF5771), was able to increase the dissociation rate of [H-3]Org 43553 by 3.3-fold (at 10 mu M). In a functional assay, the presence of 24 resulted in a 2- to 3-fold lower potency of both Org 43553 and LH.

Drug discovery had been rooted in testing of molecules on intact animal tissue until technology provided high-throughput binding assays for screening. While this allowed for the testing of large numbers of molecules, it also limited detection to molecules that interfere with the interaction of the receptor with a defined probe (i.e., radioligand). The ability to monitor functional changes in cells (recombinant or natural) provided a huge leap forward. Earlier functional assays were tied to specific signaling pathways (i.e., cyclic AMP and calcium) but now label-free assays in live cells provide the opportunity to detect more ligands and more fully characterize their efficacy. These ideas will be discussed in terms of harnessing the phenomenon of "functional selectivity" for therapeutic advantage.

From this study, it was revealed that removal of the hydrogen bond-donating ability of the 5'-uronamide was essential for the pure A(3)AR antagonism. 5'-N,N-Dimethyluronamide derivatives exhibited higher binding affinity than larger 5'-N,N-dialkyl or 5'-N,N-cycloalkylamide derivatives, indicating that steric factors are crucial in binding to the human A(3)AR. A N-6-(3-bromobenzyl) derivative 6c (K-i = 9.32 nM) exhibited the highest binding affinity at the human A3AR with very low binding affinities to other AR subtypes. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The preparation procedures are time- and labor-consuming and produce particles of wide size distributions. To answer the need for fast and straightforward routes to spherical molecularly imprinted polymer beads, we have developed a method comprising the formation of droplets of pre-polymerization solution directly in mineral oil by vigorous mixing followed by transformation of the droplets into solid spherical beads by photoinduced free-radical polymerization. No detergents or stabilizers were required for the droplet formation. Factors influencing the bead synthesis have been investigated and are detailed here. The beads were evaluated in parallel with corresponding irregularly shaped particles prepared from polymer monoliths. Conditions for the synthesis of propranolol-imprinted poly( methacrylic acid-co-trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate) beads in the size range of 1-100 Am in almost quantitative yield are described. The beads were applied as the recognition element in a 96-well plate format radioligand assay of propranolol in human serum.

Codeine was converted in four steps into N-benzylnorcodeine which was oxidised by using the Swern protocol. Subsequent acid-catalysed rearrangement afforded N-benzylnormorphothebaine which was selectively triflylated at the 2-position and pivaloylated at the 11-position. The triflate underwent palladium-catalysed amination with benzophenone imine. Amination conditions required sequential base addition to give substantial conversion of the triflate to the corresponding N-substituted benzophenone imine. After acidic hydrolysis the resulting aniline was transformed into the 2-fluoro compound via the Balz-Schiemann reaction. Hydrogenolysis of the N-benzyl group followed by deprotection of the catechol moiety using BBr3 provided 2-fluoronorapomorphine. (c) Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Serotonin-active antidepressant drugs have also been found to decrease binge eating. Objective: We investigated serotonin transporter binding in obese binge-eating women. Eleven obese binge-eating and seven obese control women participated in the study. The subjects were not taking any medication known to affect serotonin (5-HT) transporters. Methods: We used single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) with the radioligand I-123-labelled nor-beta -CIT, which specifically labels 5-HT transporters. Results: Obese binge-eating women showed significantly decreased 5-HT transporter binding in the mid-brain compared with obese controls (2.1 +/-0.5 versus 2.9 +/-0.5, respectively). Conclusions: SPECT imaging with a ligand specific for 5-HT transporters can be used to assess altered serotonin transporter binding in the living human brain. The results tentatively suggest that 5-HT transporter binding is decreased in binge-eating women.

In an effort to develop imaging probes for CXCR4, we developed a novel small molecule CXCR4-targeted PET agent (compound 5) by combining our established benzenesulfonamide scaffold with a labeling component by virtue of click chemistry. 5 shows nanomolar affinity (IC50 = 6.9 nM) against a known CXCR4 antagonist (TN14003) and inhibits more than 65% chemotaxis at 10 nM in vitro assays. Radiofluorinated compound 5 ([F-18]5) demonstrates a competitive cellular uptake against CXCL12 in a dose-dependent manner. Further, microPET images of [F-18]5 exhibits preferential accumulation of radioactivity in the lesions of.-carrageenan-induced paw edema, human head and neck cancer orthotopic xenograft, and metastatic lung cancer of each mouse model.

We hypothesized that some of the active components of hemorheologic TCMs may function through targeting prothrombotic P2Y(1) and/or P2Y(12) receptors. The interactions between 253 antithrombotic compounds from TCM and these two G protein-coupled P2Y receptors were evaluated using virtual screening. Eleven highly ranked hits were further tested in radioligand binding and functional assays. Among these compounds, salvianolic acid A and C antagonized the activity of both P2Y(1 )and P2Y(12) receptors in the low mu M range, while salvianolic acid B antagonized the P2Y(12) receptor. These three salvianolic acids are the major active components of the broadly-used hemorheologic TCM Danshen (Salvia militorrhiza), the antithrombotic molecular mechanisms of which were largely unknown. Thus, the combination of virtual screening and experimental validation identified potential mechanisms of action of multicomponent drugs that are already employed clinically.

The biological profiles of the novel compounds were assessed using radioligand binding assays, and the compounds with the highest affinities were investigated for their functional activity. The results were in line with the available pharmacophore models and highlighted that the 1,4-dioxane scaffold is compatible with potent antagonist activity at NMDA receptor or high affinity for sigma(1) receptors. The primary amines 6b and 7 bearing a cyclohexyl and a phenyl ring or two phenyl rings in position 6, respectively, were the most potent noncompetitive antagonists at the NMDA receptor with IC50 values similar to those of the dissociative anesthetic (S)-(+)-ketamine. The 5,5-diphenyl substitution associated with a benzylaminomethyl moiety in position 2, as in 18, favored the interaction with sigma(1) receptors.

J	Uusi-Oukari, M; Maksay, G				Uusi-Oukari, Mikko; Maksay, Gabor			Allosteric modulation of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]EBOB binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by diflunisal analogues	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						GABA; GABA receptor; diflunisal; meclofenamate; allosteric modulation	HIGH-AFFINITY; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; GLYCINE RECEPTORS; RAT FOREBRAIN; ACID; SITES; AGONISTS; PHARMACOLOGY; CEREBELLAR; CONVULSANT	Allosteric modulatory effects of 12 biphenyl derivatives of diflunisal and two fenamates were studied on A-type receptors of GABA (GABA(A)R) via [H-3]4'-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB) binding to synaptic membrane preparations of rat forebrain. A simplified ternary allosteric model was used to determine binding affinities of the compounds and the extents of cooperativity with GABA. Structure activity analysis revealed that 4-hydroxy substituents of the biphenyls contribute to their micromolar binding affinities more than 3-carboxyl groups. Electron-withdrawing fluorinated substituents, especially in ortho position, were also advantageous. These factors also strongly enhanced the cooperativity with GABA binding. The correlation between displacing potency of the allosteric agents and cooperativity with GABA suggests that these processes are associated with common mechanisms. The pharmacological relevance of these interactions is discussed. These data help to differentiate the structural requirements of these agents to act on GABAergic neurotransmission versus nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory effects. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Besides their anxiolytic effect, they are reported to exert a direct relaxing action on several smooth muscle preparations, including the uterus. In the present study, the possibility of the involvement of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors in this peripheral effect is investigated. The tocolytic potencies of diazepam, midazolam and nitrazepam are assessed in vivo in a postpartum rat model, together with other drugs known to bind to alpha-adrenoceptors (e.g. alpha(1)-antagonists, tricyclic compounds and droperidol). The interactions of some benzodiazepines and norepinephrine were also examined in an isolated in vitro system. The affinities of these agents for the receptor in question were additionally tested by radioligand displacement assay. A correlation was found between the tocolytic potencies and inhibition constants of the tested drugs, suggesting that the smooth muscle-relaxing effect of these benzodiazepines is mediated through modulation of the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors.

MSS have a scintillant 'head' group (2,5-diphenyloxazole) attached to a lipophilic 'tail.' MSS do not scintillate in an aqueous environment in the presence of a radioactive source: however, in a non-aqueous environment, such as a lipid bilayer (e.g., liposome or cell membrane), scintillation does occur. MSS can be incorporated into liposomes. When these MSS-containing liposomes are fused with the plasma membranes of cells in culture the MSS are incorporated into the cell membrane. Radiolabelled molecules in close proximity to the cell membrane will then elicit a scintillation signal. This system has been used to successfully monitor [C-14] methionine uptake in HeLa cells and may be used in radiochemical and radioligand binding assays either in vivo or on microsomal preparations obtained from tissues. This new scintillation proximity technology could be readily adapted for high-throughput screening. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

An increased expression of M2 and to a lesser extent of M5 receptors and no changes of M4 receptor were observed in PBL of asthmatics compared to control individuals. The increase was related to bronchial hyperresponsiveness detected by methacholine challenge test. Analysis of M3 receptor expression revealed biphasic changes, with a decreased receptor density in patients with normal, mild and moderate responses to methacholine test land a recovery to levels similar to those found in healthy individuals in severe responders to methacholine test. The demonstration of a different expression of lymphocyte muscarinic receptors in asthma suggests that cholinergic system may participate to a molecular framework influencing immune functions in asthma.

We then synthesized these peptides to test their opioid activity. The IC50 of these peptides in mouse vas deferens assay were 51.0 muM and 24.4 muM, respectively, and those in delta receptor binding assay using [H-3]deltorphin II as radioligand were 2.09 muM and 0.93 muM, respectively. Both peptides were selective for delta receptor. We named them rubiscolin-5 and -6, respectively. Rubiscolin-5 and -6 have antinociceptive activity in mice after i.c.v. or oral administration. The enzymatic conditions to release rubiscolin were investigated using both spinach Rubisco and synthetic fragment peptides. This is the first example of bioactive peptides derived from plant Rubisco. (C) 2001 Federation of European Biochemical Societies. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

ANA-binding sites were detected in striatum and hippocampus membranes using [S-35]-ADP betaS as radioligand and Ap(4)A and epsilon-(Ap(4)A), di-ethenoadenosine tetraphosphate, as displacers. Effects of epsilon-(Ap(4)A) on extracellular glutamate levels were studied using intracerebral perfusion. Both areas contain high-affinity binding sites for [S-35]-ADP betaS with K-d values in the low nM range. [S-35]-ADP betaS binding was displaced by Ap(4)A and epsilon-(Ap(4)A). At 1 and 10 muM doses, epsilon-(Ap(4)A) markedly decreased glutamate levels in the striatum. The possibility of Ap(4)A acting as an endogenous modulator of excitatory neurotransmission is discussed.

The presented series focuses on modifications to the core and top motif of the reported leads, MIPS1650 (1) and MIPS1780 (2). Profiling of our novel analogues showed that these modifications result in more nuanced effects on the allosteric properties compared to our previous compounds with alterations to the biaryl pendant. Further pharmacological characterisation of the selected compounds in radioligand binding, IP(1)accumulation and beta-arrestin 2 recruitment assays demonstrated that, despite primarily acting as affinity modulators, the PAMs displayed different pharmacological properties across the two cellular assays. The novel PAM7 fis a potential lead candidate for further development of peripherally restricted M(1)PAMs, due to its lower blood-brain-barrier (BBB) permeability and improved exposure in the periphery compared to lead2.

Computational studies on an "in-house" collection of quinazoline derivatives, featuring highly steric demanding groups at the amide nitrogen, suggested that, despite their molecular extension, these ligands are still easily lodged in the TSPO binding site. Binding assays supported. this hypothesis, highlighting a low nanomolar/subnanomolar affinity of these ligands, together with a higher RT of the representative compound 11 with respect to our previously reported indole-based fluorescent probe. Thanks to the amenability of the amide nitrogen atom to be substituted with bulky groups, we developed quinazoline-based imaging tools by fluorescently labeling the scaffold at this position. Probes with relevant TSPO affinity, favorable spectroscopic properties, and improved RT were identified. The results from fluorescence microscopy showed that these probes specifically labeled the TSPO at the mitochondrial level in the U343 cell line.

Adenovirus Capsid-Based Anti-Cocaine Vaccine Prevents Cocaine from Binding to the Nonhuman Primate CNS Dopamine Transporter	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cocaine; vaccine; dopamine transporter (DAT); PET imaging; addiction	SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; DISRUPTED ADENOVIRUS; BRAIN; PET; DEPENDENCE; OCCUPANCY; ADDICTION; MONKEY; ANALOG; GENE	Cocaine addiction is a major problem for which there is no approved pharmacotherapy. We have developed a vaccine to cocaine (dAd5GNE), based on the cocaine analog GNE linked to the capsid proteins of a serotype 5 adenovirus, designed to evoke anti-cocaine antibodies that sequester cocaine in the blood, preventing access to the CNS. To assess the efficacy of dAd5GNE in a large animal model, positron emission tomography (PET) and the radiotracer [C-11]PE2I were used to measure cocaine occupancy of the dopamine transporter (DAT) in nonhuman primates. Repeat administration of dAd5GNE induced high anti-cocaine titers. Before vaccination, cocaine displaced PE2I from DAT in the caudate and putamen, resulting in 62 +/- 4% cocaine occupancy. In contrast, dAd5GNE-vaccinated animals showed reduced cocaine occupancy such that when anti-cocaine titers were >4 x 10(5), the cocaine occupancy was reduced to levels of <20%, significantly below the 47% threshold required to evoke the subjective 'high' reported in humans.

These quinoxaline derivatives showed excellent affinity for A beta(1) (42) aggregates with K(i) values ranging from 2.6 to 10.7 nM. Autoradiography with sections of brain tissue from an animal model of AD mice (APP/PS1) and AD patients revealed that [(125)I]5 labeled beta-amyloid plaques specifically. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, [(125)I]5 displayed high uptake (6.03% ID/g at 2 min) into and a moderately fast washout from the brain. Although additional refinements are needed to decrease the lipophilicity and improve the washout rate, the quinoxaline scaffold may be useful as a backbone structure to develop novel beta-amyloid imaging agents.

Although these observations on adenosine have been known for a long time, how adenosine acts to achieve its antiischemic effect remains incompletely understood. Recent advances in the chemistry and pharmacology of adenosine receptor ligands have provided important and novel information on the function of adenosine receptor subtypes in the cardiovascular system. The development of model systems for the cardiac actions of adenosine has yielded important insights into its mechanism of action and have begun to elucidate the sequence of signaling events from receptor activation to the actual exertion of its cardioprotective effect. The goal of the current article is to review recent advances on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the cardiac actions of adenosine and to show the cardioprotective effect of novel adenosine ligands.

The potent and selective KOR antagonist RTI-97 labeled with carbon-11 was previously demonstrated to display specific KOR binding in mouse brain by ex vivo autoradiography studies. Herein, we evaluated [C-11]RTI-97 in rat by in vitro autoradiography and by in vivo PET imaging. The radiosynthesis of [C-11]RTI-97 was optimized to obtain high molar activities. Despite a low cerebral uptake, the overall results showed a heterogeneous repartition and specific KOR binding of [C-11]RTI-97 in brain and a high and specific accumulation of [C-11]RT1-97 in pituitary in accordance with KOR expression.

Thirty-three analogs of a ligand that was discovered in a structure-based virtual screen against the hA(2A)AR were tested in hA(1), A(2A), and A(3) radioligand binding assays and in functional assays for the A(2B)AR subtype. As a series of closely related analogs of the initial lead, 1, did not display improved binding affinity or selectivity, molecular docking was used to guide the selection of more distantly related molecules. This resulted in the discovery of 32, a hA(2A)AR antagonist (K-i 200 nM) with high ligand efficiency. In light of the SAR for the 1,2,4-triazole scaffold, we also investigated the binding mode of these compounds based on docking to several A(2A)AR crystal structures.

Quantitative autoradiography and homogenate radioligand binding of [(125) I]-Bolton Hunter substance P ([(125) I]-BHSP) were used to compare brain NK1 receptors in young (2 months) and aged (18-20 months) rats. 2. The autoradiographic distribution and density of [(125) I]-BHSP binding sites was similar in all cortical regions of young and aged rats. In contrast, the density of [(125) I]-BHSP binding sites was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in the basal forebrain nuclei (intermediate part of the lateral septal nuclei, medial septal nucleus and horizontal and vertical nuclei of the diagonal band) of aged rats. In all other brain regions examined, binding densities were almost identical in young and aged rats. 3. Because a population of NK1 receptors ([(125) I]-BHSP binding sites) in the basal forebrain nuclei is associated with cholinergic neurons, the decrease in NK1 receptors in aged rats may reflect degeneration of cholinergic neurons and contribute to the motor and cognitive deficiencies that occur with ageing.

The estimation of the test-retest reproducibility is important for accurate interpretation of PET studies. Results: We performed two [C-11]-L-deprenyl-D-2 scans for six healthy subjects and evaluated the test-retest variability of this radioligand. MAO-B binding was quantified by two tissue compartment model (2TCM) with three rate constants (K-1, k(2), k(3)) using metabolite-corrected plasma radioactivity. The lambda k(3) defined as (K-1/k(2)) x k(3) was also calculated. The correlation between MAO-B binding and age, and the effect of partial volume effect correction (PVEc) for the reproducibility were also estimated. % difference of k(3) was 2.6% (medial frontal cortex) to 10.3% (hippocampus), and that of lambda k(3) was 5.0% (thalamus) to 9.2% (cerebellum). Mean % difference of all regions were 5.3 and 7.0% in k(3) and lambda k(3), respectively. All regions showed below 10% variabilities except the hippocampus in k(3) (10.3%). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of k(3) was 0.78 (hippocampus) to 0.98 (medial frontal cortex), and that of lambda k(3) was 0.78 (hippocampus) to 0.95 (thalamus). Mean ICC were 0.94 and 0.89 in k(3) and lambda k(3), respectively. The highest positive correlation with age was observed in the hippocampus, as r = 0.75 in k(3) and 0.76 in lambda k(3). After PVEc, mean % difference were 5.6 and 7.2% in k(3) and lambda k(3), respectively. Mean ICC were 0.92 and 0.90 for k(3) and lambda k(3,) respectively. These values were almost the same as those before PVEc. Conclusions: The present results indicate that k(3) and.k(3) of [C-11]-L-deprenyl-D-2 are reliable parameters for test-retest reproducibility with healthy subjects both before and after PVEc. The studies with patients of larger sample size are required for further clinical applications.

Aiming at red-emitting fluorescent ligands for the hH(2)R, a series of squaramides labeled with pyridinium or cyanine fluorophores (19-27) was synthesized and characterized. The highest hH(2)R affinities in radioligand competition binding assays were obtained in the case of pyridinium labeled antagonists 19-21 (pK(i): 7.71-7.76) and cyanine labeled antagonists 23 and 25 (pK(i): 7.67, 7.11). These fluorescent ligands proved to be useful tools for binding studies (saturation and competition binding as well as kinetic experiments), using confocal microscopy, flow cytometry, and high content imaging. Saturation binding experiments revealed pK(d) values comparable to the pK(i) values. The fluorescent probes 21, 23, and 25 could be used to localize H-2 receptors in HEK cells and to determine the binding affinities of unlabeled compounds.

Structure-Activity Relationship, Pharmacological Characterization, and Molecular Modeling of Noncompetitive Inhibitors of the Betaine/γ-Aminobutyric Acid Transporter 1 (BGT1)	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SUBTYPE-SELECTIVE INHIBITOR; GABA UPTAKE; BINDING-SITE; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; RECOGNITION; VALIDATION; PREDICTION; DOMAINS; RESIDUE; TARGETS	N-(1-Benzy1-4-piperidiny1)-2,4-dichlorobenzamide 5 (BPDBA) is a noncompetitive inhibitor of the betaine/GABA transporter 1 (BGT1). We here report the synthesis and structure-activity relationship of 71 analogues. We identify 26m as a more soluble 2,4-Cl substituted 3 pyridine analogue with retained BGT1 activity and an improved off-target profile compared to 5. We performed radioligand-based uptake studies at chimeric constructs between BGT1 and GAT3, experiments with site-directed mutated transporters, and computational docking in a BGT1 homology model based on the newly determined X-ray crystal structure of the human serotonin transporter (hSERT). On the basis of these experiments, we propose a binding mode involving residues within TM10 in an allosteric site in BGT1 that corresponds to the allosteric binding pocket revealed by the hSERT crystal structure. Our study provides first insights into a proposed allosteric binding pocket in BGT1, which accommodates the binding site for a series of novel noncompetitive inhibitors.

Discovery and Preclinical Characterization of 3-((4-(4-Chlorophenyl)-7-fluoroquinoline-3-yl)sulfonyl)benzonitrile, a Novel Non-acetylenic Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 (mGluR5) Negative Allosteric Modulator for Psychiatric Indications	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GLUR5 RECEPTORS; RADIOLIGAND; PREDICTION; POTENT; GPCRS; HIT	Negative allosteric modulators (NAM) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) have been implicated as a potential pharmacotherapy for a number of psychiatric diseases, including anxiety and depression. Most of the mGluR5 NAM clinical candidates can be characterized by the central acetylenic moiety that connects the terminal pharmacophores. Identification of a sulfoquinoline hit via high throughput screening (HTS) followed by optimization provided a 4-phenyl-3-aryl-sulfoquinoline lead compound with the minimal pharmacophore. Optimization of the core and aryl appendages was performed by scanning and matrix libraries synthesized by the multiple parallel synthesis approach. Biological evaluation of matrix libraries provided a number of potent, metabolically stable, and in vivo active compounds. One of these compounds, 25 showed high efficacy and safety in preclinical in vivo models; this allowed its nomination as a novel, nonacetylenic mGluR5 NAM clinical candidate. Compound 25 was advanced to first-in-man trials for the treatment of psychiatric conditions.

Structure-affinity and structure-kinetics relationships were established, and computational studies of a homology model of the hA(1)AR revealed crucial interactions for both the affinity and dissociation kinetics of this family of ligands. These results were also combined with global metrics (Ligand Efficiency, cLogP), showing the importance of binding kinetics as an additional way to better select a drug candidate amongst seemingly similar leads.

They displayed high binding affinity to A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i = 6.4 for 8, K-i = 3.0 for 9), and the high binding were confirmed by in vitro autoradiography with AD human and transgenic mouse brain sections. Two of them were selected for F-18-labeling directly on the benzene ring. In biodistribution experiments, [F-18]8 and [F-18]9 displayed high initial uptakes (9.29 +/- 0.41 and 5.38 +/- 0.68% ID/g) and rapid washouts from the normal brain (brain(2) (min)/brain(60) (min) ratios of 21.6 and 13.4).

The present work shows that rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, induced time- and concentration-dependent apoptosis in lymphocytes which was mediated by anion superoxide radicals (O-2 center dot(-))/hydrogen peroxide, depolarization of mitochondria, caspase-3 activation, concomitantly with the nuclear translocation of transcription factors such as NF-kappa B, p53, c-Jun and nuclei fragmentation. Since insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) interferes with a cell's apoptotic machinery when subjected to several stressful conditions, it is demonstrated here for the first time that IGF-1 effectively protects lymphocytes against rotenone through PI-3K/Akt activation, down-regulation of p53 and maintenance of mitochondrial membrane potential independently of ROS generation. These data might contribute to understanding the role played by IGF-1 against oxidative stress stimuli.

The influence of para substitution in the phenyl ring, substitution at position 4 of the coumarin system, and the coumarin position at which the piperazinylalkyl chain is linked was explored. Electron-withdrawing phenyl ring substituents para to the piperazine strongly reduced activity at both receptors. Binding at 5HT(1A) was influenced by the bulk of substituents at position 4 of the coumarin system, and binding at D-2A by their electronic properties. Neither binding affinity was significantly affected by whether the piperazinylalkyl chain was inserted at position 6 or 7 of the coumarin system.

Binding to this site was saturable, specific, reversible, and of high-affinity. Data fit to a single-site binding model by non-linear regression (r(2) = 0.99) estimated K-d = 1.73 +/- 0.45 X 10(-9) M and B-max = 49.0 +/- 12.2 fmol (.) mg(-1) tissue. Total binding of [I-125][y(1)]SchistoFLRFamide to membrane preparations was reduced in the presence of GTPgammaS, an indication that the putative receptor is G protein-coupled. Structure-activity studies determined that the minimum sequence required for binding was HVFLRFamide. Other aspects of the ligand receptor interaction were also examined.

Age-related changes in binding of the D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C](+) PHNO in healthy volunteers	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dopamine; Aging; D2R; D3R; PET imaging; [C-11](+)PHNO	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOPAMINE D-3 RECEPTOR; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; HUMAN-BRAIN; AGONIST RADIOLIGAND; D3 RECEPTORS; TEST-RETEST; HUMANS; PET	Objective: Previous imaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET) have reliably demonstrated an age-associated decline in the dopamine system. Most of these studies have focused on the densities of dopamine receptor subtypes D2/3R (D2R family) in the striatum using antagonist radiotracers that are largely nonselective for D(2)Rvs. D3R subtypes. Therefore, less is known about any possible age effects in D-3-rich extrastriatal areas such as the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) and hypothalamus. This study sought to investigate whether the receptor availability measured with [C-11](+) PHNO, a D3R-preferring agonist radiotracer, also declines with age. Methods: Forty-two healthy control subjects (9 females, 33 males; age range 19-55 years) were scanned with [C-11](+) PHNO using a High Resolution Research Tomograph (HRRT). Parametric images were computed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2) with cerebellum as the reference region. Binding potentials (BPND) were calculated for the amygdala, caudate, hypothalamus, pallidum, putamen, SN/VTA, thalamus, and ventral striatum and then confirmed at the voxel level with whole-brain parametric images. Results: Regional [C-11](+) PHNO BPND displayed a negative correlation between receptor availability and age in the caudate (r=-0.56, corrected p=0.0008) and putamen (r=-0.45, corrected p= 0.02) in healthy subjects (respectively 8% and 5% lower per decade). No significant correlations with age were found between age and other regions (including the hypothalamus and SN/VTA). Secondary whole-brain voxel-wise analysis confirmed these ROI findings of negative associations and further identified a positive correlation in midbrain (SN/VTA) regions. Conclusion: In accordance with previous studies, the striatum (an area rich in D2R) is associated with age-related declines of the dopamine system. We did not initially find evidence of changes with age in the SN/VTA and hypothalamus, areas previously found to have a predominantly D3R signal as measured with [C-11](+) PHNO. A secondary analysis did find a significant positive correlation in midbrain (SN/VTA) regions, indicating that there may be differential effects of aging, whereby D2R receptor availability decreases with age while D3R availability stays unchanged or is increased.

Their good in vivo imaging properties have previously been shown in preclinical studies. Among IBTs, fluorinated [F-18]FIBT was selected for further characterization and advancement toward use in humans. [F-18]FIBT characteristics were analyzed in relation to Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) as reference ligand. [F-18]FIBT and [H-3]PiB were coinjected to an APP/PS1 mouse for ex vivo dual-label autoradiographic correlation. Acute dose toxicity of FIBT was examined in two groups of healthy mice. Preexisting in vivo stability and biodistribution studies in mice were complemented with analogous studies in rats. [F-18]FIBT was titrated against postmortem human AD brain homogenate in a saturation binding assay previously performed with [H-3]PiB. Binding of [F-18]FIBT to human AD brain was further analyzed by in vitro incubation of human AD brain sections in comparison to [C-11]PiB in relation to standard immunohistochemistry. Finally, [F-18]FIBT was administered to two human subjects for a dynamic 90 min PET/MR brain investigation. Ex vivo autoradiography confirmed good uptake of [F-18]FIBT to mouse brain and its excellent correlation to [H-3]PiB binding. No toxicity of FIBT could be found in mice at a concentration of 33.3 nmol/kg. As in mice, [F-18]FIBT was showing high in vivo stability in rats and comparable regional brain biodistribution dynamics to [H-3]PiB. Radioligand saturation binding confirmed at least one high-affinity binding component of [F-18]FIBT around 1 nM. Good binding of FIBT relative to PiB was further confirmed in binding assays and autoradiographies using post-mortem AD brain. First use of [F-18]FIBT in humans successfully yielded clinical [F-18]FIBT PET/MR images with very good contrast. In summary, [F-18]FIBT has been characterized to be a new lead compound with improved binding characteristics and pharmacokinetics on its own as well as in comparison to PiB. A pilot human PET investigation provided high-quality images with a plausible tracer distribution pattern. Detailed clinical investigations are needed to confirm these first results and to explore the specific qualities of [F-18]FIBT PET for dementia imaging in relation to established ligands.

Methods: From 208 patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA every 6-8 wk, 26 who had not progressed and not experienced grade 3 or higher toxicity after 6 cycles continued to receive Lu-177-PSMA until disease progression, complete remission, or removal from treatment because of toxicity or patient preference. Response rates, the additional benefit of treatment extension, and toxicity were assessed. Results: During treatment extension (<= 13 cycles), 50% of patients achieved an additional prostate-specific antigen decline (-52% +/- 34%; range, -1% to -100%), with 8% of patients achieving a congruent prostate-specific antigen-based and imaging-based complete response. Median progression-free survival was 450 d. Acute toxicity, including myelosuppression, was mild (<= grade 2). Xerostomia and chronic kidney disease became more common with repetitive dosing. Conclusion: Extension of Lu-177-PSMA treatment is feasible and effective inmetastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is one of the key targets involved in the activation of the immune system. A suitable ligand for CCR2 could be a useful tool to study immune activation in central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Herein, we describe the synthesis, tritium radiolabelling, and preliminary in vitro evaluation in post-mortem human brain tissue of a known potent small molecule antagonist for CCR2. The preparation of a tritium-labelled analogue for the autoradiography (ARG) study gave rise to an intriguing and unexpected side reaction profile through a novel amination of ethanol and methanol in the presence of tritium. After successful preparation of the tritiated radioligand, in vitro ARG measurements on human brain sections revealed nonspecific binding properties of the selected antagonist in the CNS.

Compound 24, with an EC50 of 0.5 nM against HIV-1 entry into host cells and an IC50 of 16.4 nM for inhibition of radioligand stromal-derived factor-1a (SDF-1a) binding to CXCR4, was also found to be highly selective against closely related chemokine receptors. We rationalized that compound 24 complementarily interacted with the critical CXCR4 residues that are essential for binding to HIV-1 gp120 V3 loop and subsequent viral entry. Compound 24 showed a 130-fold increase in anti-HIV activity compared to that of the marketed CXCR4 antagonist, AMD3100 (Plerixafor), whereas both compounds exhibited similar potency in mobilization of CXCR4(+)/CD34(+) stem cells at a high dose. Our study offers insight into the design of anti-HIV therapeutics devoid of major interference with SDF-1 alpha function.

In vitro binding assay showed that they displayed binding affinities to A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i = 15.86-393.18 nM). In vitro autoradiography studies further confirmed the high and specific binding of [Tc-99m]20 to beta-amyloid plaques on brain sections of transgenic mice. Biodistribution study of [Tc-99m]17-20 in normal mice displayed moderate initial brain uptake (0.96-1.55%ID/g at 2 min), and fast washed out from the brain (0.14-0.40%ID/g at 60 min), especially for [Tc-99m]20 with a brain(2min)/brain(60min) ratio of 8.86. Taken together, these preliminary data suggested that [Tc-99m]20 may be a potential imaging probe for detecting amyloid plaques in the brain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Methacrylic acid (MAA) was selected as the functional monomer and symmetrical dimethacrylate crosslinkers of different length between the double bound as well as an asymmetrical crosslinker containing an allylic and a methacrylic double bond were investigated in this study. The rebinding experiments were carried by radioligand experiments in presence of [H-3]-(S)-propranolol. The microstructure of MIPs (morphology, crosslinking density and surface properties) were analysed by B.E.T. surface, SEM images and swelling experiments. MIPs containing 1,6 hexanediol dimethaaylate (HDDMA) and allyl methacrylate (AMA) improved the binding results of MIPs having the most common crosslinking agent ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA). In addition, methyl methacrylate (MMA) was included in the formulation to decrease the crosslinking density. The binding specificity decreased except for MIPs containing AMA as crosslinking agent, which showed a similar specificity to MIPs without MMA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Structure of AMP-PNP-bound vitamin B<sub>12</sub> transporter BtuCD-F	NATURE			English	Article							ABC TRANSPORTER; ATP-BINDING; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PROTEIN COMPLEX; MECHANISM; DOMAIN; INTERMEDIATE; SUGGEST; SYSTEM	The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter BtuCD mediates the uptake of vitamin B-12 across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. Previous structures have shown the conformations of apo states, but the transport mechanism has remained unclear. Here we report the 3.5 angstrom crystal structure of the transporter-binding protein complex BtuCD-BtuF (BtuCD-F) trapped in an beta-gamma-imidoadenosine 5'-phosphate (AMP-PNP)-bound intermediate state. Although the ABC domains (BtuD subunits) form the expected closed sandwich dimer, the membrane-spanning BtuC subunits adopt a new conformation, with the central translocation pathway sealed by a previously unrecognized cytoplasmic gate. A fully enclosed cavity is thus formed approximately halfway across the membrane. It is large enough to accommodate a vitamin B-12 molecule, and radioligand trapping showed that liposome-reconstituted BtuCD-F indeed contains bound B-12 in the presence of AMP-PNP. In combination with engineered disulphide crosslinking and functional assays, our data suggest an unexpected peristaltic transport mechanism that is distinct from those observed in other ABC transporters.

Substructure-Based Virtual Screening for Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> Receptor Ligands	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article						adenosine A(2A) receptor; antagonists; drug discovery; GPCRs; virtual screening	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ANTAGONISTS; PHARMACOLOGY	A virtual ligand-based screening approach was designed and evaluated for the discovery of new A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR) ligands. For comparison and evaluation, the procedures from a recently published virtual screening study that used the A(2A) AR X-ray crystal structure for the target-based discovery of new A(2A) ligands were largely followed. Several screening models were constructed by deriving the distinguishing structural features from selected sets of A(2A) AR antagonists, so-called frequent substructure mining. The best model in statistical terms was subsequently applied to large-scale virtual screens of a commercial vendor library. This resulted in the selection of 36 candidates for acquisition and testing. Of the selected candidates, eight compounds significantly inhibited radioligand binding at A(2A) AR (> 30%) at 10 mm, corresponding to a "hit rate" of 22%. This hit rate is quite similar to that of the referenced target-based virtual screening study, while both approaches yield new, non-overlapping sets of ligands.

Discovery of a Competitive Apelin Receptor (APJ) Antagonist	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article						antagonists; apelin/APJ; molecular dynamics; pharmacology; pharmacophores	PARTICLE MESH EWALD; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; ENDOGENOUS LIGAND; PEPTIDE; SIMULATION; CORECEPTOR; ANALOGS; BINDING; DESIGN; HIV-1	The apelin receptor (APJ) is a class A G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and is a putative target for the treatment of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Apelin-13 (NH(2)-QRPRLSHKGPMPF-COOH) is a vasoactive peptide and one of the most potent endogenous inotropic agents identified to date. We report the design and discovery of a novel APJ antagonist. By using a bivalent ligand approach, we have designed compounds with two 'affinity' motifs and a short series of linker groups with different conformational and non-bonded interaction properties. One of these, cyclo(1-6) CRPRLC-KH-cyclo(9-14)CRPRLC is a competitive antagonist at APJ. Radioligand binding in CHO cells transfected with human APJ gave a K(i) value of 82 nm, competition binding in human left ventricle gave a K(D) value of 3.2 mu m, and cAMP accumulation assays in CHO-K1-APJ cells gave a K(D) value of 1.32 mu m.

A general protocol for the crystallization of membrane proteins for X-ray structural investigation	NATURE PROTOCOLS			English	Article							HIGH-LEVEL EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND-BINDING METHODS; LIPIDIC CUBIC PHASES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; NMR STRUCTURE; CHANNEL; CHROMATOGRAPHY; STRATEGIES; SCATTERING; TRANSPORT	Protein crystallography is used to generate atomic resolution structures of protein molecules. These structures provide information about biological function, mechanism and interaction of a protein with substrates or effectors including DNA, RNA, cofactors or other small molecules, ions and other proteins. This technique can be applied to membrane proteins resident in the membranes of cells. To accomplish this, membrane proteins first need to be either heterologously expressed or purified from a native source. The protein has to be extracted from the lipid membrane with a mild detergent and purified to a stable, homogeneous population that may then be crystallized. Protein crystals are then used for X-ray diffraction to yield atomic resolution structures of the desired membrane protein target. Below, we present a general protocol for the growth of diffraction quality membrane protein crystals. The process of protein crystallization is highly variable, and obtaining diffraction quality crystals can require weeks to months or even years in some cases.	[Newby, Zachary E.

A combined therapy using dopaminergic agonists and adenosinergic antagonists is currently being evaluated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. [(a) Kanda, T.; et al. Exp. Neurol. 2000, 162, 321-327. (b) Jenner, P. Expert Opin. Invest. Drugs 2005, 14, 729-738. (c) Kase, H.; et al. Neurology 2003, 61 (Suppl 6), S97-S100.] Here we prepared dual ligands acting on adenosine and dopamine receptors by applying a combinatorial approach based on the ergolene privileged structure. The potency and efficacy of these novel compounds were determined by radioligand binding studies and intracellular cAMP production assays in cells expressing adenosine and dopamine receptors. Selected compounds displayed dual dopamine agonist and adenosine antagonist activity. Molecules with this pharmacological profile are potentially useful for studying dopamine-adenosine cross-talk in the central nervous system and for testing the therapeutic potential of multivalent drugs for Parkinson's disease.

GTP gamma S assay shows that MMT is an agonist with an EC50 comparable to 5-HT. Radiolabeling of 5 was achieved in 30% yield (EOS) from desmethyl-MMT (4) with >99% chemical and radiochemical purities and a specific activity >1000 Ci/mmol. PET Studies in baboon show that [C-11]5 penetrates the blood-brain barrier but, because of low specific binding and fast clearance of radioactivity it is not a suitable PET tracer for the in vivo quantification of 5-HT1AR.

Pharmacol. 64 (2003) 865-875]. Here we present the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a series of analogs of 1, where the methyl group at C-3 has been replaced by different alkyl substituents. Ring systems have been incorporated into the carbon backbone of some of the molecules, or the amino group has been build into ring systems. Furthermore, the (+)- and (-)-enantiomers of I have been separated, and X-ray crystallography has revealed that (-)-1 possesses (S)-configuration. The compounds have been characterized pharmacologically at recombinant nicotinic receptor subtypes. The structure-activity relationship study has provided valuable insight into the mode of interactions of I and its analogs with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The naphthylsulfonyl group in the potent quinazoline-type NPYY5 receptor antagonist CGP 71683A was replaced with a dansyl, nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD) or acridine-9-carbonyl group. In radioligand binding studies on human Y-5 receptor expressing HEC-1B cells the substances labelled with acridine (K-i 311 nM) and NBD (K-i > 1000 nM) proved to be moderately active or inactive, respectively By contrast, a K-i value of 49 nM was found for the dansyl analogue compared to 2 nM for CGP 71683A.

In saturation binding experiments in the presence of sodium ions, both radioligands labeled a similar number of sites, whereas in the absence of sodium ions [H-3]raclopride labeled about half the number of sites labeled by [H-3]spiperone. In competition experiments in the absence of sodium ions, however, raclopride was able to inhibit [H-3]spiperone binding fully. In saturation analyses with [H-3]spiperone in the absence of sodium ions raclopride exerted noncompetitive effects, decreasing the number of sites labeled by the radioligand. These data are interpreted in terms of a model where the receptor exists as a dimer, and in the absence of sodium ions, raclopride exerts negative cooperativity across the dimer both for its own binding and the binding of spiperone. A model of the receptor has been produced that provides a good description of the experimental phenomena described here.

CXCR4-directed PET/CT with [<SUP>68</SUP> Ga]Ga-pentixafor in solid tumors-a comprehensive analysis of imaging findings and comparison with histopathology	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article; Early Access						[(68) Ga]Ga-pentixafor; PET/CT; CXCR4; C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4; Solid tumors; Theranostics; Radioligand therapy	CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR CXCR4; 4 EXPRESSION; CANCER; CXCL12; IMPACT; IRS	Background C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is overexpressed in various solid cancers and can be targeted by CXCR4-directed molecular imaging. We aimed to characterize the in-vivo CXCR4 expression in patients affected with solid tumors, along with a comparison to ex-vivo findings.Methods A total 142 patients with 23 different histologically proven solid tumors were imaged with CXCR4-directed PET/CT using [(68) Ga]Ga-pentixafor (total number of scans, 152). A semi-quantitative analysis of the CXCR4-positive tumor burden including maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) and target-to-background ratios (TBR) using blood pool was conducted. In addition, we performed histopathological staining to determine the immuno-reactive score (IRS) from patients' tumor tissue and investigated possible correlations with SUVmax (by providing Spearman's rho rho). Based on imaging, we also assessed the eligibility for CXCR4-targeted radioligand therapy or non-radioactive CXCR4 inhibitory treatment (defined as more than five CXCR4-avid target lesions [TL] with SUVmax above 10).Results One hundred three of 152 (67.8%) scans showed discernible uptake above blood pool (TBR > 1) in 462 lesions (52 primary tumors and 410 metastases). Median TBR was 4.4 (1.05-24.98), thereby indicating high image contrast. The highest SUVmax was observed in ovarian cancer, followed by small cell lung cancer, desmoplastic small round cell tumor, and adrenocortical carcinoma. When comparing radiotracer accumulation between primary tumors and metastases for the entire cohort, comparable SUVmax was recorded (P > 0.999), except for pulmonal findings (P = 0.013), indicative for uniform CXCR4 expression among TL. For higher IRS, a weak, but statistically significant correlation with increased SUVmax was observed (rho = 0.328; P = 0.018). In 42/103 (40.8%) scans, more than five TL were recorded, with 12/42 (28.6%) exhibiting SUVmax above 10, suggesting eligibility for CXCR4-targeted treatment in this subcohort.Conclusions In a whole-body tumor read-out, a substantial portion of prevalent solid tumors demonstrated increased and uniform [(68) Ga]Ga-pentixafor uptake, along with high image contrast. We also observed a respective link between in- and ex-vivo CXCR4 expression, suggesting high specificity of the PET agent. Last, a fraction of patients with [(68) Ga]Ga-pentixafor-positive tumor burden were rendered potentially suitable for CXCR4-directed therapy.

Whole-Body PET Imaging in Humans Shows That <SUP>11</SUP>C-PS13 Is Selective for Cyclooxygenase-1 and Can Measure the In Vivo Potency of Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						cyclooxygenase-1; PET; inflammation; aspirin; celecoxib	BLOOD; INHIBITORS; BRAIN	Both cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H-2, which has proinflammatory effects. The recently developed PET radioligand C-11-PS13 has excellent in vivo selectivity for COX-1 over COX-2 in nonhuman primates. This study sought to evaluate the selectivity of C-11-PS13 binding to COX-1 in humans and assess the utility of C-11-PS13 to measure the in vivo potency of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Methods: Baseline C-11-PS13 whole-body PET scans were obtained for 26 healthy volunteers, followed by blocked scans with ketoprofen (n = 8), celecoxib (n = 8), or aspirin (n = 8). Ketoprofen is a highly potent and selective COX-1 inhibitor, celecoxib is a preferential COX-2 inhibitor, and aspirin is a selective COX-1 inhibitor with a distinctmechanismthat irreversibly inhibits substrate binding. Because blood cells, including platelets and white blood cells, also contain COX-1, C-11-PS13 uptake inhibition from blood cells was measured in vitro and ex vivo (i.e., using blood obtained during PET scanning). Results: High C-11-PS13 uptake was observed in major organs with high COX-1 density, including the spleen, lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. Ketoprofen (1-75 mg orally) blocked uptake in these organs farmore effectively than did celecoxib (100-400 mg orally). On the basis of the plasma concentration to inhibit 50% of the maximum radioligand binding in the spleen (in vivo IC50), ketoprofen (< 0.24 mu M) was more than 10-fold more potent than celecoxib (> 2.5 mu M) as a COX-1 inhibitor, consistent with the in vitro potencies of these drugs for inhibiting COX-1. Blockade of C-11-PS13 uptake from blood cells acquired during the PET scans mirrored that in organs of the body. Aspirin (972-1,950 mg orally) blocked such a small percentage of uptake that its in vivo IC50 could not be determined. Conclusion: C-11-PS13 selectively binds to COX-1 in humans and can measure the in vivo potency of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs that competitively inhibit arachidonic acid binding to COX-1. These in vivo studies, which reflect the net effect of drug absorption and metabolism in all organs of the body, demonstrated that ketoprofen had unexpectedly high potency, that celecoxib substantially inhibited COX-1, and that aspirin acetylation of COX-1 did not block binding of the representative nonsteroidal inhibitor C-11-PS13.

Pretargeted Immuno-PET of Pancreatic Cancer: Overcoming Circulating Antigen and Internalized Antibody to Reduce Radiation Doses	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						pretargeting; pancreatic cancer; PET imaging; CA19.9	CHEMISTRY; METASTASIS	5B1 is a fully human, monoclonal antibody that has shown promise for the PET imaging of cancers expressing carbohydrate antigen 19.9 (CA19.9)-a carbohydrate prevalent in cells with aberrant glycosylation and an established effector of metastasis. The long physiologic half-life of the antibody and interference from circulating CA19.9 may increase the time required to generate quality images as well as the risk of radiation exposure to healthy tissues during repeated PET imaging. Pretargeting methodologies are an effective approach to expeditiously acquire PET images, but in this case, the pretargeting approach is complicated by the internalization of 5B1 by CA19.9-expressing cells. We sought to adapt and optimize a pretargeting strategy that exploits the bioorthogonal reaction between transcyclooctene (TCO) and tetrazine (Tz) to overcome these complications. Methods: 5B1 was modified with TCO, and a novel NOTA-PEG(7)-Tz radioligand was synthesized with the goal of improving on a previously reported analog. BxPC3 and Capan-2 cells were evaluated for their ability to internalize anti-CA19.9 antibodies using a fluorometric assay, and xenografts of the same lines were used for in vivo studies. The pretargeting approach was optimized, and the 2 radioligands were compared using biodistribution and PET imaging in murine models of pancreatic cancer. Results: BxPC3 and Capan-2 cells were shown to rapidly internalize anti-CA19.9 monoclonal antibodies, including 5B1. Cu-64-NOTA-PEG(7)-Tz showed improved in vivo pharmacokinetics relative to Cu-64-NOTA-Tz using 5B1-TCO as the targeting vector. PET imaging and biodistribution studies showed that injecting the radioligand 72 h after the administration of 5B1-TCO resulted in the best uptake (8.2 +/- 1.7 percentage injected dose per gram at 20 h after injection) and tumor-to-background activity concentration ratios. Dosimetry calculations revealed that the pretargeting system produced a greater than 25-fold reduction in total body radiation exposure relative to Zr-89-desferrioxamine-5B1. PET/CT imaging in an orthotopic Capan-2 xenograft model-, which secretes large amounts of CA19.9 and more rapidly internalizes anti-CA19.9 antibodies-showed that this approach is viable even in the difficult circumstances presented by a circulating antigen and internalized targeting vector. Conclusion: The 5B1-TCO and Cu-64-NOTA-PEG(7)-Tz system evaluated in these studies can delineate CA19.9-positive xenografts in murine models of pancreatic cancer despite the challenges posed by the combination of circulating antigen and internalization of the 5B1-TCO.

However, the possible roles of CB2 receptors in the brain need to be clarified. The aim of our work was to Study the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) mRNA expression level and functional activity after acute in vivo and in vitro treatments with the endocannabinoid noladin ether (NE) and with the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 in brainstem of mice deficient in either CB1 or CB2 receptors. This study is based Oil Our previous observations that noladin ether (NE) produces decrease in the activity of MOR in forebrain and this attenuation call be antagonized by the CB2 cannabinoid antagonist SR144528, suggesting a CB2 receptor mediated effect. We U sed quantitative real-time PCR to examine the changes of MOR mRNA levels, [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assay to analyze the capability of mu-opioid agonist DAMGO to activate G-proteins and competition binding assays to directly measure the ligand binding to MOR ill mice brainstem. After acute NE administration no significant changes were observed oil MOR signaling. Nevertheless pretreatment of mice with SR144528 prior to the administration of NE significantly decreased MOR signaling Suggesting the involvement of SR144528 in mediating the effect of MOR. mRNA expression of MORs significantly decreased both in CB1 wild-type and CB1 knockout mice after a single injection of SR144528 at 0.1 mg/kg when compared to the vehicle treated controls. Consequently, MOR-mediated signaling was attenuated after acute in Vivo treatment with SR 144528 in both CB1 wild-type and CB1 knockout mice. In vitro addition of 1 mu M SR144528 Caused a decrease in the maximal stimulation of DAMGO in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays in CB2 wild-type brainstem membranes whereas no significant changes were observed in CB2 receptor knockouts. Radioligand binding competition studies showed that the noticed effect of SR 144528 oil MOR signaling is not mediated through MORs. Our data demonstrate that the SR144528 caused pronounced decrease in the activity of MOR is mediated via CB2 cannabinoid receptors. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

YO-2 have been shown to act as competitive antagonists of silkworm larval GABA(A) receptors using electrophysiology, yet no further evidence has been provided to support such an action. We have investigated the actions of chrodrimanin B on rat brain GABA(A) receptors by binding assays with non-competitive ligand of GABA(A) receptors [H-3]EBOB and competitive ligands [H-3]gabazine and [H-3]muscimol. Chrodrimanin B did not significantly affect the binding of [H-3]EBOB while reducing the binding of [H-3]gabazine and [H-3]muscimol to the rat membrane preparations. Chrodrimanin B increased the dissociation constant K-d of [H-3]gabazine and [H-3]muscimol without significantly affecting the maximum binding, pointing to competitive interactions of chrodrimanin B with rat GABA(A) receptors in support of our previous observation that the compound acts as a competitive antagonist on the silkworm larval GABA receptor.

Positron emission tomography (PET) provides a way to assess in vivo the brain distribution of NCEs and their binding to the target of interest, provided that radiolabeling of the NCE is possible or that a suitable radioligand is available. PET is therefore a key tool for early phases of drug discovery programs. This review will summarize the main applications of PET in early drug development and discuss the usefulness of PET microdosing studies performed with direct labelling of the NCE and PET occupancy studies. The purpose of this review is also to propose an alignment of the nomenclatures used by drug metabolism and pharmacokinetic scientists and PET imaging scientists to indicate key pharmacokinetic parameters and to provide guidance in the performance and interpretation of PET studies.

Imaging Autotaxin <i>In Vivo</i> with <SUP>18</SUP>F-Labeled Positron Emission Tomography Ligands	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LYSOPHOSPHATIDIC ACID; STRUCTURAL BASIS; EXPRESSION; DISCOVERY; INHIBITORS; PROMOTES; IDENTIFICATION; ACTIVATION; EVOLUTION; FIBROSIS	Autotaxin (ATX) is a secreted phosphodiesterase that has been implicated in a remarkably wide array of pathologies, especially in fibrosis and cancer. While ATX inhibitors have entered the clinical arena, a validated probe for positron emission tomography (PET) is currently lacking. With the aim to develop a suitable ATX-targeted PET radioligand, we have synthesized a focused library of fluorinated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivatives, determined their inhibition constants, and confirmed their binding mode by crystallographic analysis. Based on their promising in vitro properties, compounds 9c, 9f, 9h, and 9j were radiofluorinated. Also, a deuterated analog of [F-18]9j, designated as [F-18]ATX-1905 ([F-18]20), was designed and proved to be highly stable against in vivo radiodefluorination compared with [F-18]9c, [F-18]9f, [F-18]9h, and [F-18]9j. These results along with in vitro and in vivo studies toward ATX in a mouse model of LPS-induced liver injury suggest that [F-18]ATX-1905 is a suitable PET probe for the non-invasive quantification of ATX.

The pharmacological profile of the most active molecules towards A(1) adenosine receptors was evaluated in cAMP functional assay. Compounds demonstrated their ability to completely counteract the effect of the agonist NECA, thus demonstrating their antagonist profile.

Somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) are expressed on beta cells and are a potential target for imaging. The main objective of this study was to investigate whether pancreatic beta cells are a target for radiolabeled naphthylalanine derivatives. The molecules were subjected to in vitro and ex vivo evaluations. Pancreatic uptake of radioactivity was lower in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice than normal mice at all time points investigated (P < .05) and correlated with the number of islets in tissue sections of both control and NOD mice. Immunohistochemical and confocal fluorescent microscopic studies showed colocalization of insulin and the conjugate radioligand in the pancreas. The results demonstrated that pancreatic uptake is receptor-mediated, and that beta cells are the primary target. Copyright (C) 2008 John K. Amartey et al.

J	Pérez-Moral, N; Mayes, AG				Pérez-Moral, N; Mayes, AG			Noncovalent imprinting in the shell of core-shell nanoparticles	LANGMUIR			English	Article							MOLECULAR RECOGNITION; POLYMER PARTICLES	Propranolol was imprinted using noncovalent interactions in the shell of core-shell nanoparticles prepared by aqueous emulsion polymerization in the presence and absence of toluene. The imprinted particles were characterized, and their capacity to rebind propranolol from both organic and aqueous media was analyzed. Results showed that the amount of template incorporated into the polymer and the presence of toluene as a "porogenic" agent influenced the ability of the nanoparticles obtained to rebind propranolol. The presence of toluene during imprinting increased rebinding by about 2-fold in buffer and by 3-fold in toluene, compared with similar materials made in the absence of toluene during imprinting. It also influenced the final surface area of the particles. Binding site affinity, assessed by radioligand displacement, was measured as IC50 values of about 1-10 muM. This compares with about 3 muM for bulk polymer made with a similar composition. Finally, to demonstrate the advantages of structured particles for analytical applications a new property, fluorescence, was incorporated into the core of the particles without interfering with the imprinted shell and its ability to rebind propranolol.

METHODS: Hippocampal slices (400 pin thick) were incubated in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) previously saturated with 95% O-2 and 5% CO2 at 28 degreesC for 120 min, and then incubated with nicotine 10 mumol/L for 30, 60, 90, and 120 min. mRNA of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor was examined with semiquantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the protein level was measured by Western blot and RIA. RESULTS: The mRNA gene expression and the protein level of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor in hippocampal slices were increased after nicotine treatment. The peak of protein occurred later but higher than that of mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Both expression of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor gene transcription and post-transcriptional protein level in rat hippocampus were altered by nicotine.

We have substituted Ser for Ala(1016) at the P-region of domain III in TuCa1 (TuCa1/A1016S) and functionally expressed the channel in Xenopus oocyte along with rabbit alpha(2)/8 and beta(2b). TuCa1/AI016S has gained DHP sensitivity as high as that of a mammalian neuronal L-type Ca channel (601), but remained resistant to FPL-64176. These results reinforce the view that Ser(1016) in TuCa1/A1016S participates in DHP binding, but there exist other novel sites that fully acquire sensitivity to FPL-64176.

Our goal is to prepare a series of radiofluorinated derivatives of WAY-100635 that, in the rat, range in pharmacokinetic properties from nearly irreversible to reversible in their behavior. It appears that derivatives containing a cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (e.g., FCWAY) with its high affinity and high target to nontarget contrast, has properties suited to measure receptor concentration. Derivatives based on phenylcarboxamide (e.g., FBWAY and MeFBAWAY) have properties more suited to the measurement of changes in endogenous serotonin. The compound containing the pyrimidine moiety in place of the pyridine moeity in FBWAY (FBWAY 1,3N) appears to have intermediate properties. NUCL MED BIOL 27;5:457-462, 2000.

However, PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy can cause undesirable effects due to high accumulation of PSMA radiotracers in salivary glands and kidneys. This study assessed orally administered monosodium glutamate (MSG) as a potential means of reducing kidney and salivary gland radiation exposure using a PSMA-targeting radiotracer. Methods: This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled study enrolled 10 patients with biochemically recurrent prostate cancer. Each subject served as his own control. PET/CT imaging sessions using 2-(3-(1-carboxy-5-[(6-F-18-fluoro-pyridine-3-carbonyl)-amino]-pentyl)-ureido)-pentanedioic acid (F-18-DCFPyL) were performed 3-7 d apart, after oral administration of either 12.7 g of MSG or placebo. Data from the 2 sets of images were analyzed by placing regions of interest on lacrimal, parotid, and submandibular glands; left ventricle; liver; spleen; kidneys; bowel; urinary bladder; gluteus muscle; and malignant lesions. The results from MSG and placebo scans were compared by paired analysis of the region-of-interest data. Results: In total, 142 pathologic lesions along with normal tissues were analyzed. As hypothesized a priori, there was a significant decrease in SUVmax corrected for lean body mass (SULmax) on images obtained after MSG administration in the parotids (24% +/- 14%, P = 0.001), submandibular glands (35% +/- 11%, P < 0.001), and kidneys (23% +/- 26%, P = 0.014). Significant decreases were also observed in the lacrimal glands (49% +/- 13%, P < 0.001), liver (15% +/- 6%, P < 0.001), spleen (28% +/- 13%, P = 0.001), and bowel (44% +/- 13%, P < 0.001). A mildly lower blood pool SULmean was observed after MSG administration (decrease of 11% +/- 13%, P = 0.021). However, significantly lower radiotracer uptake in terms of SULmean, SULpeak, and SULmax was observed in malignant lesions on scans performed after MSG administration than on the placebo studies (SULmax median decrease, 33%; range, -1% to 75%; P < 0.001). No significant adverse events occurred after placebo or MSG administration, and vital signs were stable. Conclusion: Orally administered MSG significantly decreased salivary gland, kidney, and other normal-organ PSMA radiotracer uptake in human subjects, using F-18-DCFPyL as an exemplar. However, MSG caused a corresponding reduction in tumor uptake, which may limit the benefits of this approach for diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

Methods: This international multicenter, retrospective analysis included 406 men with prostate cancer who underwent Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT. Of these, 356 had positive findings and were stratified by quintiles into a very low (quintile 1, <= 25 cm(3)), low (quintile 2, 25-189 cm(3)), moderate (quintile 3, 189-532 cm(3)), high (quintile 4, 532-1,355 cm(3)), or very high (quintile 5, >= 1,355 cm(3)) total PSMA-positive tumor volume (PSMA-VOL). PSMA-VOL was obtained by semiautomatic segmentation of total tumor lesions using qPSMA software. Fifty prostate cancer patients with no PSMA-positive lesions (negative scan) served as a control group. Normal organs, which included salivary glands, liver, spleen, and kidneys, were semiautomatically segmented using Ga-68-PSMA PET images, and SUVmean was obtained. Correlations between the SUVmean of normal organs and PSMA-VOL as continuous and categoric variables by quintiles were evaluated. Results: The median PSMA-VOL was 302 cm(3) (interquartile range [IQR], 47-1,076 cm(3)). The median SUVmean of salivary glands, kidneys, liver, and spleen was 10.0 (IQR, 7.7-11.8), 26.0 (IQR, 20.0-33.4), 3.7 (IQR, 3.0-4.7), and 5.3 (IQR, 4.0-7.2), respectively. PSMA-VOL showed a moderate negative correlation with the SUVmean of the salivary glands (r = -0.44, P<0.001), kidneys (r = -0.34, P<0.001), and liver (r = -0.30, P < 0.001) and a weak negative correlation with the spleen SUVmean (r = -0.16, P = 0.002). Patients with a very high PSMA-VOL (quintile 5, >= 1,355 cm(3)) had a significantly lower PSMA uptake in the salivary glands, kidneys, liver, and spleen than did the control group, with an average difference of -38.1%, -40.0%, -43.2%, and -34.9%, respectively (P<0.001). Conclusion: Tumor sequestration affects Ga-68-PSMA biodistribution in normal organs. Patients with a very high tumor load showed a significantly lower uptake of Ga-68-PSMA in normal organs, confirming a tumor sink effect. As similar effects might occur with PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy, these patients might benefit from increased therapeutic activity without exceeding the radiation dose limit for organs at risk.

Disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis is inversely related to cerebral TSPO binding assessed by [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28 positron emission tomography	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Rheumatoid arthritis; Positron emission tomography; TSPO; Microglia; Glia cell activation; Pain; Vagus nerve; Heart rate variability	CHOLINERGIC ANTIINFLAMMATORY PATHWAY; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; HEART-RATE-VARIABILITY; PROTEIN 18 KDA; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; SYSTEMIC-LUPUS; GLIAL ACTIVATION; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; CENTRAL INFLAMMATION; PAIN	Reumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by peripheral joint inflammation. Recently, an engagement of the brain immune system has been proposed. The aim with the current investigation was to study the glial cell activation marker translocator protein (TSPO) in a well characterized cohort of RA patients and to relate it to disease activity, peripheral markers of inflammation and autonomic activity. Fifteen RA patients and fifteen healthy controls matched for age, sex and TSPO genotype (rs6971) were included in the study. TSPO was measured using Positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [C-11] PBR28. The outcome measure was total distribution volume (V-T) estimated using Logan graphical analysis, with grey matter (GM) as the primary region of interest. Additional regions of interest analyses as well as voxel-wise analyses were also performed. Clinical evaluation of disease activity, symptom assessments, serum analyses of cytokines and heart rate variability (HRV) analysis of 24 h ambulatory ECG were performed in all subjects. There were no statistically significant group differences in TSPO binding, either when using the primary outcome V-T or when normalizing V-T to the lateral occipital cortex (p > 0.05). RA patients had numerically lower V-T values than healthy controls (Cohen's D for GM = -0.21). In the RA group, there was a strong negative correlation between [C-11]PBR28 V-T in GM and disease activity (DAS28)(r = -0.745, p = 0.002, corrected for rs6971 genotype). Higher serum levels of IFN gamma and TNF-alpha were found in RA patients compared to controls (p < 0.05) and several measures of autonomic activity showed significant differences between RA and controls (p < 0.05). However, no associations between markers of systemic inflammation or autonomic activity and cerebral TSPO binding were found. In conclusion, no statistically significant group differences in TSPO binding as measured with [C-11]PBR28 PET were detected. Within the RA group, lower cerebral TSPO binding was associated with higher disease activity, suggesting that cerebral TSPO expression may be related to disease modifying mechanisms in RA. In light of the earlier confirmed neuro-immune features of RA, these results warrant further investigations regarding neuro-immune joint-to-CNS signalling to open up for potentially new treatment strategies.

Experiments were designed to assess four agonists and seven antagonists at: three cloned human dopamine receptors using agonist-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays in membranes to quantify the initial cellular event following ligand/receptor interaction. In this model there is constitutive G protein activity (agonist-independent [S-35]GTPyS binding) and potentially constitutive dopamine receptor activity. Thus, discrimination between silent antagonists, partial agonists and inverse agonists is theoretically possible. It was anticipated that distinctions could be made regarding efficacy of the seven receptor antagonists to provide insight regarding the therapeutic use of antipsychotic drugs. In membranes prepared from CHO cells transfected to express high densities of human D-2short, D-4.2 Or D-4.7 receptors, the dopamine receptor agonists apomorphine, pergolide, quinelorane and quinpirole produced concentration-dependent increases in agonist-stimulated [S-35]GTPyS binding. At the hD(2short) receptor, pergolide and apomorphine were essentially equipotent and more potent than quinelorane and quinpirole; all four agonists displayed similar efficacy at this receptor. At the hD(4.2) and the hD(4.7) receptors apomorphine was the most potent and pergolide the least efficacious of the four drugs. The ability (both potency and efficacy) of clozapine. haloperidol. olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, spiperone and ziprasidone to block apomorphine-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding and alter basal [S-35]GTPyS binding was also assessed. All of the antagonists inhibited apomorphine-stimulated [S-35]GTPyS binding with potencies (Kb values) similar to and in rank order consistent with their affinities reported in the literature using radioligand binding assays. Additionally, none of the antagonists altered basal, agonist-independent [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, thus they behaved as pure, silent antagonists at D-2short, D-4.2 and D-4.7 receptors under our conditions, In summary, the data suggest that therapeutic distinctions between typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs cannot be made based on their function at D-2short D-4.2 and D-4.7, subtypes of dopamine receptors.

In this study, we designed novel In-111-labeled granzyme B-targeting single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging probes, [In-111]IDT and [In-111]IDAT. Nonradioactive In-labeled granzyme B-targeting compounds ([In-nat]IDT, [In-nat]IDAT) showed the affinity for recombinant mouse granzyme B. [In-111]IDT and [In-111]IDAT were obtained with moderate radiochemical yield and high stability in mouse plasma (>95%). In a biodistribution experiment using tumor-bearing mice, [In-111]IDT and [In-111]IDAT showed moderate accumulation in tumor. Ex vivo autoradiography (ARG) indicated that the accumulation of radioactivity in tumor was correlated to expression of granzyme B confirmed by the immunohistochemical staining. These results indicated that [In-111]IDT and [In-111]IDAT showed the basic properties as granzyme B-targeting SPECT probes.

[F-18]CNY-07 was synthesized through copper-mediated F-18-radiolabeling from an aryl boronic ester precursor and studied in vivo PET imaging in rodents. PET imaging results showed that [F-18]CNY-07 can penetrate the blood-brain barrier with a maximum percent injected dose per unit volume of 3 at 10 min postinjection in the brain in vivo. Self-blocking studies of [F-18]CNY-07 by pretreating with unlabeled molecules in rodents showed reduced radioactivity in animal brains (30% radioactivity decreased), indicating the binding specificity of our radiotracer. Our studies demonstrate that [F-18]CNY-07 has provided a useful PET radioligand enabling brain RIPK1 imaging, which could be a valuable research tool in studying RIPK1-related neurological disorders in animals and potentially humans.

An approach to computer analysis of the ligand binding assay data on example of radioligand assay data	JOURNAL OF BIOINFORMATICS AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Ligand-receptor interactions; initial estimates; 4PL model; Feldman's model; nonlinear method	AFFINITY	As a rule, receptor-ligand assay data are fitted by logistic functions (4PL model, 5PL model, Feldman's model). The preparation of the initial estimates for parameters of these functions is an important problem for processing receptor-ligand interaction data. This study represents a new mathematical approach to calculate the initial estimates more closely to the true values of parameters. The main idea of this approach is in using the modified linear least squares method for calculations of the parameters for the 4PL model and the Feldman's model. In this study, the convergence of model parameters to true values is verified for the simulated data with different statistical scatter. Also, the results of processing real data for the 4PL model and the Feldman's model are presented. A comparison is made of the parameter values calculated by the presented and a nonlinear method. The developed approach has demonstrated its efficiency in calculating the parameters of the complex Feldman"s models up to 4 ligands and 4 sites.	[Fedotov, S.

In vitro binding assay showed that the methylated ligand, (E)-1-methoxy-4-styrylbenzene (8) displayed high binding affinity to A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i = 19.5 nM). Moreover, the C-11-labeled ligand, [C-11]8 was prepared through an O-methylation reaction using [C-11]CH3OTf. In vitro autoradiography with sections of transgenic mouse brain also confirmed the high and specific binding of [C-11] 8 to A beta plaques. In vivo biodistribution experiments in normal mice indicated that [C-11]8 displayed high initial uptake (9.41 +/- 0.51% ID/g at 5 min post-injection) into and rapid washout from the brain, with a brain(5 min)/brain(30 min) ratio of 6.63. These preliminary results suggest that [C-11]8 may be served as a novel A.. imaging probe for PET.

Bayesian L-optimal exact design of experiments for biological kinetic models	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						A-optimality; D-optimality; Enzyme kinetics; Maximum likelihood; Non-linear models	LENS ALDEHYDE DEHYDROGENASE; EFFICIENT; MAXIMIN; ROBUST	. Data from experiments in steady state enzyme kinetic studies and radioligand binding assays are usually analysed by fitting non-linear models developed from biochemical theory. Designing experiments for fitting non-linear models is complicated by the fact that the variances of parameter estimates depend on the unknown values of these parameters and Bayesian optimal exact design for non-linear least squares analysis is often recommended. It has been difficult to implement Bayesian L-optimal exact design, but we show how it can be done by using a computer algebra package to invert the information matrix, sampling from the prior distribution to evaluate the optimality criterion for candidate designs and implementing an exchange algorithm to search for candidate designs. These methods are applied to finding optimal designs for the motivating applications in biological kinetics, in the context of which some practical problems are discussed. A sensitivity study shows that the use of a prior distribution can be essential, as is careful specification of that prior.

Specific binding reaches equilibrium within 30 min, and is saturable with a K-d value of 0.5 nM. The affinities of several cholinergic agents were determined, including nicotine (K-i, 0.2 muM), cytisine (K-i, 0.4 muM), carbachol (K-i, 4.7 muM), dihydro-beta-erythrodine (K-i, 33.6 muM), D-tubocurarine (K-i, 0.4 muM), 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium (K-i, 0.8 muM), decamethonium (K-i, 234 muM) and methyllycaconitine (K-i, 1.3 muM). These values are similar to reported values for recombinant alpha3beta4 nAChRs in transfected cell lines. These studies demonstrate [H-3]epibatidine binding to an easily obtainable adrenal membrane preparation and support the characterization of adrenal nAChRs as alpha3beta4* nAChRs.

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and the ligand [I-123]iodobenzamide (IBZM) were used for in vivo imaging. Subjects commenced reading or writing immediately before IBZM injection and continued for 30 min thereafter. SPECT images were acquired 60 min later. Striatum-to-parietal-cortex IBZM uptake ratios were lower in subjects who wrote off the text than in controls indicating competition of IBZM and dopamine. There was no difference between subjects who read the text and controls. Thus, dopamine release occurs as a consequence of the motoric activity involved in writing rather than of cognitive functions necessary for reading the text. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

This straighforward silyl radical-mediated reaction utilises CH2FI as a non-ozone depleting reagent, traditionally used in electrophilic, nucleophilic and carbene-type chemistry, but not as a CH2F radical source. By circumventing the challenges associated with the high reduction potential of CH2FI being closer to CH3I than CF3I, and harnessing instead the favourable bond dissociation energy of the C-I bond, we demonstrate that feedstock electron-deficient alkenes are converted into products resulting from net hydrofluoromethylation with the intervention of (Me3Si)(3)SiH under blue LED activation. This deceptively simple yet powerful methodology was extended to a range of (halo)methyl radical precursors including ICH2I, ICH2Br, ICH2Cl, and CHBr2F, as well as CH3I itself; this latter reagent therefore enables direct hydromethylation. This versatile chemistry was applied to F-18-, C-13-, and D-labelled reagents as well as complex biologically relevant alkenes, providing facile access to more than fifty products for applications in medicinal chemistry and positron emission tomography.

The synthesized compounds 2-27 were evaluated in radioligand binding (A(1), A(2A) and A(3)) and adenylyl cyclase activity (A(2B) and A(2A)) assays, in order to evaluate their affinity and potency at human adenosine receptor subtypes. The current study allowed us to support that affinity and selectivity of 7-amino-thiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives towards the adenosine receptor subtypes can be modulated by the nature of the groups attached at positions 2, 5 and 7 of the bicyclic scaffold. To rationalize the hypothetical binding mode of the newly synthesized compounds, we also performed docking calculations in human A(2A), A(1) and A(3) structures.

The aim of the present study was the investigation of the complexes formed between a series of BN-like peptides and the nuclides Re-185/187 and Tc-99m. The Re-185/187 complexes were formed via the precursor Re-gluconate. The radiolabeling of the derivatives with Tc-99m was performed using either Tc-99m-gluconate or Tc-99m-MDP as the intermediate complex. For the in vitro evaluation of the new peptides, the cancer cell line PC3 was used. The in vivo behavior of the Tc-99m-labeled BN-like peptides was evaluated in normal mice. All the derivatives showed specific uptake in the pancreas, an organ rich in BN receptors and high affinity for the cancer cell line PC3. The above preliminary results indicated that the new BN derivatives are promising for human cancer studies.

The patients were tested at the beginning of the study and on follow-up after six months. The severity of depression was evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale of Depression (HRSD). Eight of the eighteen patients had an HRSD score below the median (12 points) on follow-up, and they had a significantly greater increase in I-123-beta-CIT binding in the midbrain region compared with those patients who did not recover (ANCOVA: F = 8.12; df = 1, 14; p = 0.013). These results indicate that recovery from depression is associated with an increase in I-123-beta-CIT binding in the midbrain.

Oral administration of YZF improved learning and memory disorders induced by chemicals in both normal and senile mice. The acetylcholine (Ach) concentration, the muscarinic Ach receptors (M-R) and the monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) activities were analysed by a radioimmunoassay, a radioligand receptor binding assay and UV spectrophotometry, respectively, using senile decapitated mice. The oral administration of YZF to the senile mice increased the M-R concentration, while the concentration of Ach and the activity of MAO-B decreased in senile mice brains. From these results it is evident that YZF promotes the function of the central cholinergic system and inhibits the activity of MAO-B in mice brains resulting in an enhancement of learning and memory.

Radioligand receptor competition studies using the delta -receptor selective agonist, [H-3]-[D-Ala2, Met5] enkephalinamide (DAMA) suggested the expression of a high affinity binding sire in rat and human blood vessels that was consistent with the delta -2 opioid receptor subtype, Using RT-PCR with primers to the cloned delta opioid receptor (DOR), a cDNA fragment identical to the known DOR sequence was obtained from the smooth muscle cell line, A-10. Stimulation of A-10 cells with DAMA resulted in a significant mobilization of intracellular calcium and membrane depolarization. Exposure of aortic rings denuded of endothelium to DAMA induced a naltrindole-senstive increase in contractile tone. These data demonstrate the presence of a functional DOR in vascular smooth muscle and a direct impact of opioids on vascular contractile tone.

Galanin-(1-16) produced a concentration dependent increase in the Kd value of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding sites with a maximal effect of similar to 61% at 30 nM without changing the B-max values. The galanin antagonist M35 blocked these effects. Rat galanin produced the same pattern of response but was less potent and effective. These results indicate the existence of a galanin receptor subtype in the ventral limbic cortex mainly recognizing N-terminal galanin fragments and capable of more strongly modulating 5-HTIA receptors than cloned galanin receptors.

With the aim of providing versatile pharmacological tools to study sigma(1) receptors, we developed three sigma(1) fluorescent tracers by functionalizing three well characterized sigma(1) ligands with a fluorescent tag. A good compromise between sigma(1) binding affinity and fluorescent properties was reached, and the sigma(1) specific targeting of the novel tracers was demonstrated by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. These novel ligands were also successfully used in competition binding studies by flow cytometry, showing their utility in nonradioactive binding assays as an alternative strategy to the more classical radioligand binding assays. To the best of our knowledge these are the first sigma(1) fluorescent ligands to be developed and successfully employed in living cells, representing promising tools to strengthen ai receptors related studies.

These methods are thus of great importance for translational brain research and have made it possible to identify and measure neurochemical changes associated with psychiatric disorders for the first time in history. The following chapter focuses on PET and SPECT imaging of psychotic disorders and addresses methods suited for imaging changes in extracellular dopamine levels and their relationship to dopamine metabolism and dopamine transporter function. Specifically, the chapter describes imaging with radiolabeled dopamine precursors (such as [F-18]DOPA) and the so-called "competition paradigms," where a change in extracellular dopamine elicits changes in radioligand binding to dopamine D-2/3 receptors. In addition to theoretical background, this chapter provides information on strengths and weaknesses as well as on practical aspects of these methods.

To study its possible influence on the binding activity and selectivity, a hydroxyl substituent was also introduced at position 4 of the coumarin moiety. Methods A new series of coumarins (39) were synthesized and evaluated by radioligand binding studies towards ARs. Key findings None of the 4-hydroxy derivatives (4, 8 and 9) showed binding affinity for any of the ARs. None of the compounds interacted with the hA2B AR (Ki > 100 000 nm). Compounds 3, 5, 6 and 7 had different activity profiles with dissimilar binding affinity and selectivity towards human A1, A2A and A3 ARs. Conclusions The most remarkable derivative is compound 7, which presents the best affinity and selectivity for the A3 adenosine receptor (Ki = 5500 nm).

Limits of Ligand Selectivity from Docking to Models: In Silico Screening for A<sub>1</sub> Adenosine Receptor Antagonists	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DISCOVERY; IDENTIFICATION; PHARMACOLOGY; RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; CHEMISTRY; LOOPS	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are attractive targets for pharmaceutical research. With the recent determination of several GPCR X-ray structures, the applicability of structure-based computational methods for ligand identification, such as docking, has increased. Yet, as only about 1% of GPCRs have a known structure, receptor homology modeling remains necessary. In order to investigate the usability of homology models and the inherent selectivity of a particular model in relation to close homologs, we constructed multiple homology models for the A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) and docked similar to 2.2 M lead-like compounds. High-ranking molecules were tested on the A(1)AR as well as the close homologs A(2A)AR and A(3)AR. While the screen yielded numerous potent and novel ligands (hit rate 21% and highest affinity of 400 nM), it delivered few selective compounds. Moreover, most compounds appeared in the top ranks of only one model. These findings have implications for future screens.

We successfully synthesized three PDB derivatives using a diazo coupling reaction. In binding experiments in vitro, the compounds displayed higher affinity for tau aggregates than for A beta aggregates. In fluorescent staining experiments using AD brain sections, 9 visualized NFTs clearly. No-carrier-added radioiodinated PDB derivatives were successfully prepared through an iododestannylation reaction from the corresponding tributyltin derivatives. [(125)I]9 labeled NFTs in sections of brain tissue from a patient with AD, but not a control. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, the PDB derivatives displayed an uptake into the brain, sufficient for imaging NFTs, ranging from 0.94 to 3.2% ID g(-1) but a relatively slow washout. Although further modifications are necessary to improve the pharmacokinetics in the brain, PDB with high affinity for tau aggregates may be useful as a backbone structure to develop agents for imaging NFTs in AD brains.

Time-efficient and convenient synthesis of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]altanserin for human PET imaging by a new work-up procedure	APPLIED RADIATION AND ISOTOPES			English	Article						5-HT2A receptor; [F-18]altanserin; PET		[F-18]Altanserin, an important PET radioligand for the in vivo imaging of the 5-HT2A receptor, was synthesized from its precursor nitro-altanserin in DMF or DMSO at high temperatures of 150 degrees C in an overall radiochemical yield (EOB) of 23-25% after 75 min. A new solid phase work-up procedure involving the acidification of the crude reaction mixture and a C18-SepPak-solid phase separation preceded the final HPLC purification. This led to a significantly reduced synthesis time as a result of a stable and early elution from the HPLC column using improved HPLC conditions (MeOH/THF/NaOAc 0.05 N pH 5: 27/18/55, flow: 5 mL/min, Symetry Prep 7 mu m C18 (Waters)). The synthesis was performed semi-automatically in a modified GE TracerLab synthesis module using an in-house-developed program. The synthesized [F-18]altanserin was used in our ongoing human and animal PET imaging studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Massarweh, G.; Kovacevic, M.; Rosa-Neto, P.; Evans, A.

Using a sensitive radioligand assay, we detected serum autoantibodies to recombinant human muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 (CHRM1, 34.4%), mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1, 13.1%), 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A (HTR1A, 7.4%), and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2, 4.9%) in 122 psychiatric patients. Positive antibodies to CHRM1 were found in 34.1%, 34.9%, 33.3%, and 9.1 % of patients with schizophrenic disorders (n = 44), mood disorders (n = 63), other psychiatric disorders (n = 15) and autoimmune diseases (n = 33), respectively. All three patients with neuroleptic maliganant syndrome had high activities of autoantibodies to CHRM1, OPRM1, and/or HTRIA. Our data suggest that autoimmunity to neurotransmitter receptors might be associated with the induction of psychiatric symptoms and have some relation to neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

PSMA PET Imaging in Glioblastoma: A Preclinical Evaluation and Theranostic Outlook	FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA); F-18-PSMA-1007 PET; glioblastoma; GL261; preclinical; mouse	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; EXPRESSION; GA-68	BackgroundProstate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET imaging has recently gained attention in glioblastoma (GBM) patients as a potential theranostic target for PSMA radioligand therapy. However, PSMA PET has not yet been established in a murine GBM model. Our goal was to investigate the potential of PSMA PET imaging in the syngeneic GL261 GBM model and to give an outlook regarding the potential of PMSA radioligand therapy in this model. MethodsWe performed an F-18-PSMA-1007 PET study in the orthotopic GL261 model (n=14 GBM, n=7 sham-operated mice) with imaging at day 4, 8, 11, 15, 18 and 22 post implantation. Time-activity-curves (TAC) were extracted from dynamic PET scans (0-120 min p. i.) in a subset of mice (n=4 GBM, n=3 sham-operated mice) to identify the optimal time frame for image analysis, and standardized-uptake-values (SUV) as well as tumor-to-background ratios (TBR) using contralateral normal brain as background were calculated in all mice. Additionally, computed tomography (CT), ex vivo and in vitro F-18-PSMA-1007 autoradiographies (ARG) were performed. ResultsTAC analysis of GBM mice revealed a plateau of TBR values after 40 min p. i. Therefore, a 30 min time frame between 40-70 min p. i. was chosen for PET quantification. At day 15 and later, GBM mice showed a discernible PSMA PET signal on the inoculation site, with highest TBRmean in GBM mice at day 18 (7.3 +/- 1.3 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.3 in shams; p=0.024). Ex vivo ARG confirmed high tracer signal in GBM compared to healthy background (TBRmean 26.9 +/- 10.5 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.7 in shams at day 18/22 post implantation; p=0.002). However, absolute uptake values in the GL261 tumor remained low (e.g., SUVmean 0.21 +/- 0.04 g/ml at day 18) resulting in low ratios compared to dose-relevant organs (e.g., mean tumor-to-kidney ratio 1.5E(-2) +/- 0.5E(-2)). ConclusionsAlthough F-18-PSMA-1007 PET imaging of GL261 tumor-bearing mice is feasible and resulted in high TBRs, absolute tumoral uptake values remained low and hint to limited applicability of the GL261 model for PSMA-directed therapy studies. Further investigations are warranted to identify suitable models for preclinical evaluation of PSMA-targeted theranostic approaches in GBM.

(hops) is a major constituent of beer. It exhibits neuroactive properties that make it useful as a sleeping aid. These effects are hypothesized to be mediated by an increase in GABA(A) receptor function. In the quest to uncover the constituents responsible for the sedative and hypnotic properties of hops, recent evidence revealed that humulone, a prenylated phloroglucinol derivative comprising 35-70% of hops alpha acids, may act as a positive modulator of GABA(A) receptors at low micromolar concentrations. This raises the question whether humulone plays a key role in hops pharmacological activity and potentially interacts with other modulators such as ethanol, bringing further enhancement in GABA(A) receptor-mediated effects of beer. Here we assessed electrophysiologically the positive modulatory activity of humulone on recombinant GABA(A) receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. We then examined humulone interactions with other active hops compounds and ethanol on GABA-induced displacement of [H-3]EBOB binding to native GABA(A) receptors in rat brain membranes. Using BALB/c mice, we assessed humulone's hypnotic behavior with pentobarbital- and ethanol-induced sleep as well as sedation in spontaneous locomotion with open field test. We demonstrated for the first time that humulone potentiates GABA-induced currents in alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2 receptors. In radioligand binding to native GABA(A) receptors, the inclusion of ethanol enhanced humulone modulation of GABA-induced displacement of [H-3]EBOB binding in rat forebrain and cerebellum as it produced a leftward shift in [H-3]EBOB displacement curves. Moreover, the additive modulatory effects between humulone, isoxanthohumol and 6-prenylnaringenin were evident and corresponded to the sum of [H-3]EBOB displacement by each compound individually. In behavioral tests, humulone shortened sleep onset and increased the duration of sleep induced by pentobarbital and decreased the spontaneous locomotion in open field at 20 mg/kg (i.p.). Despite the absence of humulone effects on ethanol-induced sleep onset, sleep duration was increased dose-dependently down to 10 mg/kg (i.p.). Our findings confirmed humulone's positive allosteric modulation of GABA(A) receptor function and displayed its sedative and hypnotic behavior. Humulone modulation can be potentially enhanced by ethanol and hops modulators suggesting a probable enhancement in the intoxicating effects of ethanol in hops-enriched beer.

To maximize the efficacy of this extremely scarce medical resource, it is important to identify predictive biomarkers of higher carbon ion relative biological effectiveness (RBE) over photons. Here we show that the carbon ion RBE in human cancer cells correlates with the cellular uptake of Cu-64(II)-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-64-ATSM), a potential radioligand that reflects an over-reduced intracellular environment. High RBE/Cu-64-ATSM cells show greater steady-state levels of antioxidant proteins and increased capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species in response to X-rays than low RBE/Cu-64-ATSM counterparts. These data suggest that the cellular antioxidant activity is a possible determinant of carbon ion RBE predictable by Cu-64-ATSM uptake. Carbon ion radiotherapy is an emerging cancer treatment modality that has a greater therapeutic window than conventional photon radiotherapy. To maximize the efficacy of this extremely scarce medical resource, it is important to identify predictive biomarkers of higher carbon ion relative biological effectiveness (RBE) over photons. We addressed this issue by focusing on cellular antioxidant capacity and investigated Cu-64(II)-diacetyl-bis(N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (Cu-64-ATSM), a potential radioligand that reflects an over-reduced intracellular environment. We found that the carbon ion RBE correlated with Cu-64-ATSM uptake both in vitro and in vivo. High RBE/Cu-64-ATSM cells showed greater steady-state levels of antioxidant proteins and increased capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species in response to X-rays than low RBE/Cu-64-ATSM counterparts; this upregulation of antioxidant systems was associated with downregulation of TCA cycle intermediates. Furthermore, inhibition of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) sensitized high RBE/Cu-64-ATSM cells to X-rays, thereby reducing RBE values to levels comparable to those in low RBE/Cu-64-ATSM cells. These data suggest that the cellular activity of Nrf2-driven antioxidant systems is a possible determinant of carbon ion RBE predictable by Cu-64-ATSM uptake. These new findings highlight the potential clinical utility of Cu-64-ATSM imaging to identify high RBE tumors that will benefit from carbon ion radiotherapy.

The second aim was to investigate factors associated with overall survival (OS). Methods We retrospectively assessed mean standardized uptake values (SUVmean) and total tumor volumes (TTV) on PSMA PET in 38 of 55 mCRPC patients before and after RLT. PSA testing and PSMA PET/CT(MRI) imaging were performed during the 8 weeks before and the 6 weeks after RLT. PSMA PET and CT(MRI) images were reviewed separately according to the modified PET Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (mPERCIST) and RECIST1.1. The results were compared with PSA responses. Associations between OS and the RECIST evaluation and changes in SUVmean, TTV, and PSA, CRP, LDH, hemoglobin and ALP levels were determined in a univariable survival analysis. Results The median PSA level at the time of pretherapy PSMA PET/CT(MRI) was 60.8 ng/ml (IQR 15.4, 264.2 ng/ml). After RLT the median PSA level decreased by 44%, TTV by 45.1%, SUVmean by 25.8% and RECIST by 11.3%. A PSA response was seen in 18 patients (47.4%), stable disease in 12 (31.6%) and progressive disease in 8 (21.1%). Contrary to the changes in SUVmean and the RECIST evaluation, the change in TTV was significantly associated with PSA response (p = 0.15, p = 0.58, and p < 0.001, respectively). After a median follow-up of 17 months (IQR 8.0, 24.2 months), 11 patients (28.9%) had died of their prostate cancer. The changes in both TTV and PSA levels were associated with OS (HR 1.001, 95% CI 1-1.003, p = 0.04, and HR 1.004, 95% CI 1.001-1.008, p = 0.01, respectively), while the changes in SUVmean and the RECIST evaluation were not. The pre-therapy CRP level was also associated with OS (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.009-1.14, p = 0.02). Conclusion TTV on PSMA PET seems to be a reliable parameter for response assessment in mCRPC patients undergoing RLT and might overcome the limitations of RECIST in prostate cancer. Furthermore, the change in TTV was significantly associated with OS in our cohort.

Here, we have designed and synthesized heterobivalent ligands for the A(2A)R-D-2R heteromer with various spacer lengths. The indispensable simultaneous binding of these ligands to the two different orthosteric sites of the heteromer has been evaluated by radioligand competition-binding assays in the absence and presence of specific peptides that disrupt the formation of the heteromer, label-free dynamic mass redistribution assays in living cells, and molecular dynamic simulations. This combination of techniques has permitted us to identify compound 26 [K-DB1 (A(2A)R) = 2.1 nM, K-DB1 (D2R) = 0.13 nM], with a spacer length of 43-atoms, as a true bivalent ligand that simultaneously binds to the two different orthosteric sites. Moreover, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments indicate that 26 favors the stabilization of the A(2A)R-D2R heteromer.

Novel Reversible-Binding PET Ligands for Imaging Monoacylglycerol Lipase Based on the Piperazinyl Azetidine Scaffold	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY TRACER; ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; MONOGLYCERIDE LIPASE; INHIBITORS; POTENT; PIPERIDINE; RADIOTRACER; ENZYMES	Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) is a 33 kDa serine protease primarily responsible for hydrolyzing 2-arachidonoylglycerol into the proinflammatory eicosanoid precursor arachidonic acid in the central nervous system. Inhibition of MAGL constitutes an attractive therapeutic concept for treating psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we present the design and synthesis of multiple reversible MAGL inhibitor candidates based on a piperazinyl azetidine scaffold. Compounds 10 and 15 were identified as the best-performing reversible MAGL inhibitors by pharmacological evaluations, thus channeling their radiolabeling with fluorine-18 in high radiochemical yields and favorable molar activity. Furthermore, evaluation of [F-18]10 and [F-18]15 ([F-18]MAGL-2102) by autoradiography and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates demonstrated favorable brain uptakes, heterogeneous radioactivity distribution, good specific binding, and adequate brain kinetics, and [F-18]15 demonstrated a better performance. In conclusion, [F-18]15 was found to be a suitable PET radioligand for the visualization of MAGL, harboring potential for the successful translation into humans.

Probes containing a fluorophore with negative charge showed high M2R affinities (pK(i) (radioligand competition binding): 9.10-9.59). Binding studies at M-1 and M-3-M-5 receptors indicated a M2R preference. Flow cytometric and high-content imaging saturation and competition binding (M1R, M2R, and M4R) confirmed occupation of the orthosteric site. Confocal microscopy revealed that fluorescence was located mainly at the cell membrane (CHO-hM(2)R cells). Results from dissociation and saturation binding experiments (M2R) in the presence of allosteric M2R modulators (dissociation: W84, LY2119620, and alcuronium; saturation binding: W84) were consistent with a competitive mode of action between the fluorescent probes and the allosteric ligands. Taken together, these lines of evidence indicate that these ligands are useful fluorescent molecular tools to label the M2R in imaging and binding studies and suggest that they have a dualsteric mode of action.

In this study the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel fluorinated pyridyl and ethyl sulfone analogues of 2-(tert-butyl)-5-((2-fluoropyridin-4-yl)sulfonyl)-1-(2-methylpentyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (rac-1a) are described. In general, the ligands showed low nanomolar potency (CB2 EC50 < 10 nM) and excellent selectivity over the CB1 subtype (>10 000x). Selected ligands 1d, 1e, 1g and 3l showing high CB2 binding affinity (K-i < 10 nM) were radiolabelled with fluorine-18 from chloropyridyl and alkyl tosylate precursors with good to high isolated radioactive yields (25-44%, non-decay corrected, at the end of synthesis). CB2-specific binding of the radioligand candidates [F-18]-1d and [F-18]-3l was assessed on rat spleen cryosections using in vitro autoradiography. The results warrant further in vivo evaluation of the tracer candidates as prospective CB2 PET-imaging agents.

Our aim was to estimate the radiation dose of [F-18]AV-1451 in humans. Whole-body PET scans were acquired for six healthy volunteers (three male, three female) for 128 min after injection of [F-18]AV-1451 (268 +/- 31 MBq). Radiation doses were estimated using the OLINDA/EXM software. The estimated organ doses ranged from 7.81 to 81.2 mu Sv/MBq. The critical organ for radiation burden was the liver. Radiation doses to the reproductive and blood-forming organs were 14.15, 8.43, and 18.35 mu Sv/MBq for the ovaries, testes, and red marrow, respectively. The mean effective dose was 22.47 +/- 3.59 mu Sv/MBq. A standard single injection of 185 MBq (5 mCi) results in an effective dose of 4.7 mSv in a healthy subject. Therefore, [F-18]AV-1451 could be used in multiple PET scans of the same subject per year.

However, aqueous extracts of Stylotella aurantium and Axinella carteri collected in Yap State, Micronesia, afforded a known N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-type glutamate receptor agonist, (2S,4S)-4-sulfooxypiperidine-2-carboxylic acid (2), as a common active principle. Both 1 and 2 induced convulsive behaviors in mice upon intracerebroventricular (icv) injection with ED50 values of 29 +/- 3.0 and 20 +/- 2.8 pmol/mouse, respectively. Radioligand binding assay using rat cerebrocortical membrane demonstrated that I and 2 inhibit the binding of the labeled NMDA receptor ligand [H-3]CGP39653 at IC50 values of 83 +/- 15 and 214 +/- 20 nM, respectively. However, 1 and 2 did not displace [H-3]kainic acid or [H-3]AMPA. These data indicated that 1 is a selective NMDA-type glutamate receptor ligand with potent convulsant activity in mice.

Muell. Arg., had marked dose-dependent, opioid-like activity. Phytochemical analyses of P. colorata flowers and leaves identified several pyrrolidinoindoline alkaloids, including psychotridine. To further investigate the activity and mechanism of action of Psychotria alkaloids, we studied the effects of psychotridine on thermal and chemical models of analgesia. In the tail-flick model, psychotridine presents a dose-dependent analgesic effect; the effect is not reversed by prior treatment with naloxone. Psychotridine dose-dependently decreased capsaicin-induced pain. Performance in the rotarod test showed that psychotridine does not induce motor deficits at doses effective in analgesia models, Psychotridine inhibited [H-3]MK-801 (dizocilpine) binding to cortex membranes in a dose-dependent manner, Binding is completely abolished at 300 nM, The data rule out opioid activity, and the inhibition of capsaicin-induced pain and of radioligand binding strongly suggest the participation of NMDA receptors in psychotridine-induced analgesia.

Currently, conventional imaging modalities such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging contribute largely to the noninvasive diagnosis and treatment evaluation of those infections. These techniques, however, often fall short when a fast, noninvasive and specific diagnosis of fungal infection is necessary. Molecular imaging, especially using nuclear medicine-based techniques, aims to develop fungal-specific radiotracers that can be tested in preclinical models and eventually translated to human applications. In the last few decades, multiple radioligands have been developed and tested as potential fungal-specific tracers. These include radiolabeled peptides, antifungal drugs, siderophores, fungal-specific antibodies, and sugars. In this review, we provide an overview of the pros and cons of the available radiotracers.

Site-specific effects of neurosteroids on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activation and desensitization	ELIFE			English	Article							INHIBITORY POSTSYNAPTIC CURRENTS; AMINOBUTYRIC ACID(A) RECEPTORS; RADIOLIGAND-BINDING METHODS; STEROID INTERACTION; MODULATION; MEMBRANE; INTERFACES; PHOSPHORYLATION; DETERMINANTS; PHARMACOLOGY	This study examines how site-specific binding to three identified neurosteroid-binding sites in the alpha(1)beta(3) GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) contributes to neurosteroid allosteric modulation. We found that the potentiating neurosteroid, allopregnanolone, but not its inhibitory 3 beta-epimer epi-allopregnanolone, binds to the canonical beta(3)(+)-alpha(1)(-) intersubunit site that mediates receptor activation by neurosteroids. In contrast, both allopregnanolone and epi-allopregnanolone bind to intrasubunit sites in the beta(3) subunit, promoting receptor desensitization and the alpha(1) subunit promoting effects that vary between neurosteroids. Two neurosteroid analogues with diazirine moieties replacing the 3-hydroxyl (KK148 and KK150) bind to all three sites, but do not potentiate GABA(A)R currents. KK148 is a desensitizing agent, whereas KK150 is devoid of allosteric activity. These compounds provide potential chemical scaffolds for neurosteroid antagonists. Collectively, these data show that differential occupancy and efficacy at three discrete neurosteroid-binding sites determine whether a neurosteroid has potentiating, inhibitory, or competitive antagonist activity on GABA(A)Rs.

Several techniques are available for characterizing the binding of small molecules to soluble proteins. The situation is different for integral membrane proteins. Isothermal chemical denaturation has been shown to be a valuable biophysical method to determine, in a direct and label-free fashion, the binding of ligands to soluble proteins. In this study, the application of isothermal chemical denaturation was applied to an integral membrane protein, the A2a G-protein coupled receptor. Binding affinities for a set of 19 small molecule agonists/antagonists of the Ala receptor were determined and found to be in agreement with data from surface plasmon resonance and radioligand binding assays previously reported in the literature. Therefore, isothermal chemical denaturation expands the available toolkit of biophysical techniques to characterize and study ligand binding to integral membrane proteins, specifically G-protein coupled receptors in vitro.

The compounds 14 and 21 showed binding at the l-opioid receptor (MOR), while the compound 11a exhibited dual affinities at both MOR and kappa-opioid receptor (KOR). MAP kinase activation indicated all three compounds have opioid agonistic properties. The presence of a double bond and endo-methylcarboxylate group in the dehydroisoquinuclidine ring and the benzofuran and methylene spacer appeared to be essential for opioid receptor binding. Further studies demonstrated 11a caused significant antinociception in mice in the hot-plate test which was comparable to that produced by morphine. The compound 11a was also found to be nontremorigenic unlike various iboga congeners. This study identifies a new pharmacophore which may lead to the development of suitable substitute of morphine in the treatment of pain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we have developed a class of tau ligands, phenyl/pyridinyl-butadienyl-benzothiazoles/benzothiazoliums (PBBs), for visualizing diverse tau inclusions in brains of living patients with AD or non-AD tauopathies and animal models of these disorders. In vivo optical and positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging of a transgenic mouse model demonstrated sensitive detection of tau inclusions by PBBs. A pyridinated PBB, [C-11]PBB3, was next applied in a clinical PET study, and its robust signal in the AD hippocampus wherein tau pathology is enriched contrasted strikingly with that of a senile plaque radioligand, [C-11]Pittsburgh Compound-B ([C-11]PIB. [C-11]PBB3-PET data were also consistent with the spreading of tau pathology with AD progression. Furthermore, increased [C-11]PBB3 signals were found in a corticobasal syndrome patient negative for [C-11]PIB-PET.

The most promising fluorescent probes had Y1R affinities (radioligand binding) and antagonistic activities (calcium assay) in the one-to two-digit nanomolar range. These compounds turned out to be stable under assay conditions and to be appropriate for the detection of Y(1)Rs by confocal microscopy in live cells. To improve the signal-to-noise ratio by shifting the emission into the near infrared, a new benzothiazolium-type fluorescent cyanine dye (UR-DE99) was synthesized and attached to the parent antagonist via a carbamoyl linker yielding UR-MK131, a highly potent fluorescent Y1R probe, which was also successfully applied in flow cytometry.

To elucidate the mechanism of action of camphoric acid in osteoblast differentiation, we evaluated the induction of transient receptor potential (TRP) cation channel family members and glutamate signaling molecules. TRPM7 and TRPV1 were highly expressed, but their expression was unaffected by camphoric acid. Camphoric acid is structurally similar to glutamate receptor ligands and significantly induced the expression of NMDAR1, GluR3/4, and mGluR8. However, camphoric acid exhibited weak regulatory activity toward glutamate receptors in a radioligand binding assay. Camphoric acid also significantly induced the activation of NF-kappa B and AP-1. Together, these data suggest that the stimulatory effect of camphoric acid on osteoblast differentiation was the result of its ability to induce mRNA expression of glutamate signaling molecules and to activate transcription factors.

P2Y<sub>1</sub> antagonists:: Combining receptor-based modeling and QSAR for a quantitative prediction of the biological activity based on consensus scoring	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTORS; PLATELET-AGGREGATION; POTENT ANTAGONISTS; BINDING-AFFINITY; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; RATIONAL DESIGN; ANALOGS; AGONISTS; NUCLEOSIDES; DERIVATIVES	P2Y(1) is an ADP-activated G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Its antagonists impede platelet aggregation in vivo and are potential antithrombotic agents. Combining ligand and structure-based modeling we generated a consensus model (LIST-CM) correlating antagonist structures with their potencies. We docked 45 antagonists into our rhodopsin-based human P2Y(1) homology model and calculated docking scores and free binding energies with the Linear Interaction Energy (LIE) method in continuum-solvent. The resulting alignment was also used to build QSAR based on CoMFA, CoMSIA, and molecular descriptors. To benefit from the strength of each technique and compensate for their limitations, we generated our LIST-CM with a PLS regression based on the predictions of each methodology. A test set featuring untested substituents was synthesized and assayed in inhibition of 2-MeSADP-stimulated PLC activity and in radioligand binding. LIST-CM outperformed internal and external predictivity of any individual model to predict accurately the potency of 75% of the test set.

Inhibition could be mediated by either the p75NTR or TrkA receptor. We used a functional block of p75NTR by REX antibody in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and dorsal root ganglion cultures from p75NTR knockout mice. In both systems, high-dose NGF inhibited neurite outgrowth, implying that p75NTR is not involved in suppression of neurite outgrowth. Confocal images of dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons exposed to fluorescence-tagged NGF showed ligand internalization. Radioligand binding indicated disappearance of high-affinity binding sites from the surface of dorsal root ganglia after treatment with 200 ng/ml NGF for 1 h. Downstream signaling showed sustained hyperphosphorylation of MAPK (Erk(1-2)) but not of SNT or Akt. Highdose NGF may induce cytoplasmic relocation of the receptor TrkA and axonal growth arrest independently of p75NTR. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

By linking the DOTA chelating agent to position 8 of the deamino derivative of Lys(8)-vasotocin (dLVT), we obtained a new compound (DOTA-dLVT) with the following characteristics: ( 1) it forms a monomeric and stable compound that binds to OTR with an affinity comparable to that of the endogenous OT ligand; ( 2) it is characterised by a very good selectivity profile for the human OTR, with a low affinity binding to the closely related V1a, V1b and V2 vasopressin receptor subtypes; ( 3) it induces rapid and persistent receptor internalisation and ( 4) when radiolabelled, [In-111]DOTA- dLVT is efficiently and selectively taken up by OTR-positive tumours grown in mice. These features makes radiolabelled DOTA- dLVT a very good candidate for the radiotargeting of OTR-expressing tumours.

Procedures Adult WT (n = 9) and HET (n = 14) mice underwent a 90-min [C-11]SCH23390 positron emission tomography (PET) scan followed by computed tomography (CT) to evaluate the pharmacokinetic modelling in healthy and diseased conditions. Additionally, 5 WT mice and 7 HET animals received a second [C-11]SCH23390 PET scan for test-retest reproducibility. Parallel assessment of the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM), the multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM) and the Logan reference tissue model (Logan Ref) using the striatum as a receptor-rich region and the cerebellum as a receptor-free (reference) region was performed to define the most suitable method for regional- and voxel-based quantification of the binding potential (BPND). Finally, standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR-1) was assessed as a potential simplified measurement. Results For all models, we measured a significant decline in dopamine D1R density (e.g. SRTM = - 38.5 +/- 5.0 %, p < 0.0001) in HET mice compared to WT littermates. Shortening the 90-min scan duration resulted in large underestimation of striatal BPND in both WT mice (SRTM 60 min: - 17.7 +/- 2.8 %, p = 0.0078) and diseased HET (SRTM 60 min: - 13.1 +/- 4.1 %, p = 0.0001). Striatal BPND measurements were very reproducible with an average test-retest variability below 5 % when using both MRTM and SRTM. Parametric BPND maps generated with SRTM were highly reliable, showing nearly perfect agreement to the regional analysis (r(2) = 0.99, p < 0.0001). Finally, SRTM provided the most accurate estimate for relative tracer delivery R-1 with both regional- and voxel-based analyses. SUVR-1 at different time intervals were not sufficiently reliable when compared to BPND (r(2) < 0.66). Conclusions Ninety-minute acquisition and the use of SRTM for pharmacokinetic modelling is recommended. [C-11]SCH23390 PET imaging demonstrates optimal characteristics for the study of dopamine D1R density in models of psychiatric and neurological disorders as exemplified in the Q175DN mouse model of HD.

However, to the best of our knowledge murine models to study the biologic effects of various activity levels have not been established. The aim of this study was to optimize specific and total activity for Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT in a syngeneic model of murine prostate cancer. Methods: Murine-reconstituted, oncogene-driven prostate cancer cells (0.1 x 10(6)) (RM1), transduced to express human prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), were injected into the left flank of C57Bl6 immunocompetent mice. RLT was performed by administering a single tail vein injection of Lu-177-PSMA-617 at different formulations for specific (60 MBq at high, 62 MBq/nmol; intermediate, 31 MBq/nmol; or low 15 MBq/nmol specific activity) or total activity (30, 60, or 120 MBq). Organ distribution was determined by ex vivo gamma-counter measurement. DNA double-strand breaks were measured using anti-gamma-H2A.X (phospho S139) immunohistochemistry. Efficacy was assessed by serial CT tumor volumetry and F-18-FDG PET metabolic volume. Toxicity was evaluated 4 wk after the start of RLT. Results: Mean tumor-to-kidney ratios +/- SEM were 19 +/- 5, 10 +/- 5, and 2 +/- 0 for high, intermediate, and low (each n = 3) specific activity, respectively. Four of 6 (67%) mice treated with intermediate or high specific activity and none of 6 (0%) mice treated with low specific activity or formulation demonstrated significant DNA double-strand breaks (>= 5% gamma-H2A.X-positive cells). High when compared with intermediate or low specific activity resulted in a lower mean +/- SEM tumor load by histopathology (vital tissue, 4 +/- 2 vs. 8 +/- 3 mm(2); n = 3 vs. 6), day-4 F-18-FDG PET (metabolic volume, 87 +/- 23 vs. 118 +/- 14 mm(3); n 5 = 6 vs. 12), and day-7 CT (volume, 323 +/- 122 vs. 590 +/- 46 mm(3); n = 3 vs. 6; P = 5 0.039). Lu-177-PSMA-617 (120 MBq) with high specific activity induced superior tumor growth inhibition (P = 0.021, n = 5/group) without subacute hematologic toxicity (n = 3/group). Conclusion: Lu-177-PSMA-617 (120 MBq) and high specific activity resulted in the highest efficacy in a syngeneic model of murine prostate cancer. The model will be useful for studying the effects of PSMA-directed RLT combined with potentially synergistic pharmacologic approaches.

J	Zaknun, JJ; Schücktanz, H; Aichner, F				Zaknun, J. J.; Schuecktanz, H.; Aichner, F.			Impact of instrumentation on DaTSCAN imaging:: how feasible is the concept of cross-systems correction factor?	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						DaTSCAN; instrumentation, semi-quantification; correction factor	DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; DISEASE; SPECT; PARKINSONISM	Aim. The aim of this investigation was to study the impact of applying different camera emission computed tomography (ECT) systems on semi-quantitative analysis of the novel dopamine transporter (DaT) radioligand [I-123]-ioflupane (DaTSCAN) and whether applying a system-dependent correction factor is feasible to allow a migration of a "normal" reference data set between systems. Methods. Two triple-head systems, PrismXP-3000 equipped with high resolution Fan-Beam (PRISM) and Irix (Philips Medical Systems, Europe) equipped with high resolution parallel whole collimators (IRIX), were compared in phantom and patient studies. Acquisition and quantification parameters were standardized. The anthropometric striatal calibration phantom (RSD Inc., CA, USA) at rising striatum: background ratios between 2-11 was studied. Fifty-one consecutive patients (25 females, age 64.5 +/- 11.9 years, and 26 males, age 60.6 +/- 12.7 years) were randomized to both cameras for acquisition time typically beginning 3.5 to 4.5 h after i.v. injection of 123I-Joflupane at 2.06 +/- 0.47 MBq/kg. Striatal uptake of the radioligand was categorized as normal or abnormal, and abnormal images were further subdivided into 3 severity levels. Striatum: cerebellum ratio (SCr) was determined by applying a fixed circular or rectangular striatal and fuzzy cerebellar regions. The effect of introducing scatter compensation (Sc) on quantification and on SCr was investigated. Results. The regression coefficient (Rc) of SCr computed for both systems was close to identity (IRIX=0.999 x (PRISM)+0.48 and 1.01 x (PRISM)+0.86 for right and left striatum). Rc of SCr values in the phantom studies was closer to identity when Sc was added (IRIX=0.982 x [PRISM]+0.724 with Sc vs 1.22 x [PRISM]-0.32 without Sc). SCr values were higher for IRIX by 5-10%. Including Sc increased the percent recovery and the linear dynamic range for both systems; however, fan beam recovery decreased at low SCr values. The delineation of the striatal boundaries improved after applying Sc. identifying the cerebellar region was easier with PRISM owing to significantly higher count statistics. Both systems performed equally well with respect to image quality Visual scoring by 2 observers correlated significantly on the kappa-test (K: 0.883, T: 10, P<0.0001). Conclusion. A simple linear correction is applicable to normal" reference data set to migrate from one system to another; however, data acquisition and quantification parameters need to be standardized. Higher recovery values are dependent on system resolution. The spatial distribution and image quality of DaTSCAN on different high-resolution systems applying standardized acquisition and reconstruction protocols is less operator dependent and does not affect visual rating of striatal DaT loss.

Fluorine-18 was introduced into 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)-8-(2-fluoroethyl)nortropane (4) by preparation of 1-[F-18]fluoro-2-tosyloxyethane (2) followed by alkylation of 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)nortropane (3) in 21% radiochemical yield (decay corrected to end of bombardment [EOB]), Competition binding in cells stably expressing the transfected human DAT serotonin transporter (SERT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET) labeled by [H-3]WIN 35428, [H-3]citalopram, and [H-3]nisoxetine, respectively, indicated the following order of DAT affinity: GBR 12909 > CIT >> 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl) -8-(3 -fluoropropyl) nortropane (FPCT) > FECNT, The affinity of FECNT for SEPT and NET was 25- and 156-fold lower, respectively, than for DAT, Blocking studies were performed in rats with a series of transporter-specific agents and demonstrated that the brain uptake of [F-18]FECNT was selective and specific for DAT-rich regions. PET brain imaging studies in monkeys demonstrated high [F-18]FECNT uptake in the caudate and putamen that resulted in caudate-to-cerebellum and putamen-to-cerebellum ratios of 10.5 at 60 min. [F-18]FECNT uptake in the caudate/putamen peaked in less than 75 min and exhibited higher caudate- and putamen-to-cerebellum ratios at transient equilibrium than reported for C-11-WIN 35,428, [C-11]CIT/RTI-55, or [F-18] beta-CIT-FP. Analysis of monkey arterial plasma samples using high performance liquid chromatography determined that there was no detectable formation of lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites capable of entering the brain. In equilibrium displacement experiments with CIT in rhesus monkeys, radioactivity in the putamen was displaced with an average half-time of 10.2 min. These results indicate that [F-18]FECNT is a radioligand that is superior to C-11-WIN 35,428, [C-11]CIT/RTI-55, [F-18]beta-CIT-FP, and [F-18]FPCT for mapping brain DAT in humans using PET.

TSPO is widely expressed in peripheral tissues, including the adrenal gland, kidney, lung, and heart. Because of its pharmacological actions related to inflammation, TSPO has become a useful biomarker for monitoring inflammation using positron emission tomography (PET) with a specific radiotracer. Herein, the author reviews the results of PET imaging with a TSPO-specific radiotracer [F-18]FEDAC to noninvasively visualize and quantify TSPO in the peripheral tissues and monitor various inflammatory diseases, such as lung inflammation, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, liver damage, liver fibrosis, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatic arthritis, in animal models. [F-18]FEDAC-PET is a powerful tool for imaging TSPO and monitoring the progress of various inflammatory diseases of the peripheral system.

A small library of bis-amide analogues of carfentanil was created using N-alkylpiperidones, aniline, propionic acid, and various aliphatic isocyanides. Our lead compound showed high affinity for mu (MOR) and delta opioid receptors (DOR) with no appreciable affinity for kappa (KOR) receptors in radioligand binding assays. The compound was found to be a mixed MOR agonist/partial DOR agonist in [S-35]GTP gamma S functional assays, and it showed moderate analgesic potency in vivo. The compound showed no visible signs of physical dependence or constipation in mice. In addition, it produced less respiratory depression than morphine. Most mixed MOR/DOR opioids reported in the literature are peptides and thereby systemically inactive. Our approach utilizing a multicomponent reaction has the promise to deliver potent and efficacious small-molecule analgesics with potential clinical utility.

Here, we investigate the diagnoses behind patients with hard-to-classify tremor and normal DaT-SPECT. Therefore, 30 patients with tremor and normal DaT-SPECT were followed up for 2 years. In 18 cases we were able to make a diagnosis. The residual 12 patients underwent a second DaT-SPECT, were then followed for additional 12 months and thereafter the diagnosis was reconsidered again. The final diagnoses included cases of essential tremor, dystonic tremor, multisystem atrophy, vascular parkinsonism, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, fragile X associated tremor ataxia syndrome, psychogenic parkinsonism, iatrogenic parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. However, for 6 patients the diagnosis remained uncertain. Larger series are needed to better establish the relative frequency of the different conditions behind these cases.

The compounds were synthesized through a copper-catalyzed coupling procedure and characterized for their pKa values. TP receptor antagonism was assessed on human platelets; COX-2 inhibition was determined on human isolated monocytes and human whole blood. TPa receptor binding of the most promising compounds was evaluated through radioligand binding assays. Some of the isosteric substitutions at the carboxylic acid group afforded compounds with improved TP receptor antagonism; of these, a tetrazole derivative retained good COX-2 inhibitory activity and selectivity. The identification of this tetrazole acting as a balanced dual-acting compound in human whole blood, along with SAR analysis of the synthesized lumiracoxib derivatives, might contribute to the rational design of a new class of cardioprotective anti-inflammatory agents.

Identification of the PGRMC1 protein complex as the putative sigma-2 receptor binding site	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							MEMBRANE COMPONENT 1; RAT-LIVER; IN-VITRO; PROGESTERONE; LIGANDS; PROLIFERATION; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; ANALOGS; SIGMA-2-RECEPTORS	The sigma-2 receptor, whose gene remains to be cloned, has been validated as a biomarker for tumour cell proliferation. Here we report the use of a novel photoaffinity probe, WC-21, to identify the sigma-2 receptor-binding site. WC-21, a sigma-2 ligand containing both a photo-active azide moiety and a fluorescein isothiocyanate group, irreversibly labels sigma-2 receptors in rat liver; the membrane-bound protein was identified as PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1). Immunocytochemistry reveals that both PGRMC1 and SW120, a fluorescent sigma-2 receptor ligand, colocalize with molecular markers of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria in HeLa cells. Overexpression and knockdown of the PGRMC1 protein results in an increase and a decrease in binding of a sigma-2 selective radioligand, respectively. The identification of the putative sigma-2 receptor-binding site as PGRMC1 should stimulate the development of unique imaging agents and cancer therapeutics that target the sigma-2 receptor/PGRMC1 complex.

GHB-Induced Cognitive Deficits During Adolescence and the Role of NMDA Receptor	CURRENT NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Addiction; juvenile; cognitive function; glutamatergic; radioligand binding; western blot; NR subunit; GHB	GAMMA-HYDROXYBUTYRIC ACID; SEXUAL ASSAULT; RAT-BRAIN; EPSILON-1 SUBUNIT; WORKING-MEMORY; MICE LACKING; GLUTAMATE; HIPPOCAMPUS; WITHDRAWAL; SEIZURES	We have earlier reported that-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) disrupts the acquisition of spatial learning and memory in adolescent rats. GHB is known to interact with several neurotransmitter systems that have been implicated in cognitive functioning. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NR)-type of glutamate receptor is considered to be an important target for spatial learning and memory. Molecular mechanisms governing the neuroadptations following repeated GHB treatment in adolecent rats remain unknown. We examined the role of NMDA receptor in adolescent GHB-induced cognitive deficit. Adolescent rats were administered with GHB on 6 consecutive days, and surface-expressed NMDA receptor subunits levels were measured. GHB significantly decreased NR1 levels in the frontal cortex. Adolescent GHB also significantly reduced cortical NR2A subunit levels. Our findings support the hypothesis that adolescent GHB-induced cogntive deficits are associated with neuroadaptations in glutamatergic transmission, particulaly NR functioning in the frontal cortex.

JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						benzodiazepines; [H-3]Ro 15-1788; carp; autoradiography; binding; brain	AMINOBUTYRIC ACID(A) RECEPTORS; GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; GUSTATORY SYSTEM; SUBUNITS; SUBTYPES; PHARMACOLOGY; FOREBRAIN; COMPLEX; STOICHIOMETRY	This study demonstrates, for the first time, by both autoradiography and binding assay that [H-3]Ro 15-1788 binds to carp brain with a high degree of anatomical selectivity. Saturation binding of the radioligand was determined in seven anatomically defined regions and suggested the presence of one class of binding sites (Type I-Ike). In general, there was a good correlation between the autoradiographic and the binding data. By far, the optic tectum and the vagal, facial, and glossopharyngeal lobes showed the majority of [H-3]Ro 15-1788 binding sites. Low to negative concentration of binding sites was detected in the cerebellum. The location of [H-3]Ro 15-1788 binding sites in particular brain regions, indicates that benzodiazepine receptors could be associated with pathways involved in the control of basic central functions as spatial learning acquisition and retention, and feeding behaviour.

It has been shown to block anxiety in the fear-potentiated startle model. Its relatively low bioavailability in different animal species drove the need for an effective prodrug form that would produce a therapeutic response at lower doses for the treatment of anxiety disorders. We have investigated the increase of intestinal absorption of this compound by targeting the human peptide transporter hPepT1 for active transport of di- and tripeptides derived from 1. We have found that oral administration of an N dipeptide derivative of 1 (12a) in rats shows up to an 8-fold increase in drug absorption and a 300-fold increase in potency in the fear-potentiated startle model in rats when compared with the parent drug 1.

We tested the hypothesis that vinpocetine binds to peripheral benzodiazepine binding sites (PBBS) and is therefore a potential ligand of PBBS. Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements in two cynomolgous monkeys showed that pretreatment with vinpocetine markedly reduced the brain uptake of [11C]PK11195, a known PBBS radioligand. On the other hand, whereas pretreatment with PK11195 increased the brain uptake of [(11)C]vinpocetine due to the blockade of PBBS in the periphery, it significantly reduced the binding potential (BP) values of [(11)C]vinpocetine in the whole brain and in individual brain structures to PK11195. These findings indicate that, whereas the two ligands have different affinities to PBBS, vinpocetine is a potent ligand of PBBS, which in turn suggests that the pharmacological activity of vinpocetine may involve the regulation of glial functions.

We undertook this study to clarify the actions of dopamine in vivo on lymphocyte proliferation and to determine whether such effects are mediated by alterations in interleukin-2 (IL-2) production and/or IL-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression. Administration of the dopamine precursor, L-dopa, for 5 days to BALB/c mice significantly increased Concanavalin A (ConA)-induced proliferation of lymphocytes. This effect was blocked by treatment with dopamine receptor antagonists as well as a peripheral dopamine synthesis inhibitor, suggesting a peripheral action of dopamine. L-dopa treatment had no effect on IL-2 production or IL-2R expression, indicating that the effects of dopamine on lymphocyte proliferation are not indirectly mediated by alterations in the IL-2 system.

The present study evaluates beta(2)-AR mRNA level, number, subtype and the cyclic adenosine-3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) response to isoproterenol (iso) in the human airway epithelial cell lines 16HBE14o(-), Calu-3 and A549, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), radioligand binding studies, [H-3]-radioimmunoassay and immunocytochemical staining. After 4-5 days in culture, all three cell types produced beta(2)-AR mRNA and protein at a magnitude of gene expression levels Calu-3 greater than or equal to 16HBE14o(-) > A549, whereas control cells Cos-1 and Caco-2 were negative. The beta(2)-AR adenylate cyclase system was highly expressed and functional in the human air-way epithelia] cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-). The mean beta(2)-AR density (B-max), equilibrium dissociation constant (K-D), and the percentage of beta-AR subtypes assessed by radioligand binding were approximately 9908 +/- 1127 and 6423 +/- 895 binding sites/cell, 32 +/- 2.7 pM and 25 +/- 1.1 pM, and approximately 100% in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, respectively. However, in the alveolar cell type A549 the cell surface beta(2)-AR was virtually undetectable by (-)-[I-121]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP) binding. Stimulation of cultured cells with (-)-isoproterenol enhanced the basal cyclic AMP accumulation only in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o- cells, which was blocked by the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118,551, but not by the beta(1)-selective antagonist CGP 20712A, confirming functional coupling of the beta(2)-AR to adenylate cyclase in these cells. Immunocytochemical staining localised the receptor on the cell membrane and the cytoplasm in Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) cells, while it was confined to the cytoplasm only in A549 cells. In conclusion, the beta(2)-AR expression and its functional coupling to adenylyl cyclase was very high in the human airway epithelial cells Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-), but not in A549, suggesting that the cell lines Calu-3 and 16HBE14o(-) present suitable models to study function and regulation of the beta-adrenoceptor signalling in the respiratory system.

Re-challenge Lu-177-PSMA therapy in early responders has been shown to be safe and effective. We report the use of low-dose Taxol-based chemotherapy (modified dose 25 mg/m(2) weekly x 6 weeks) as a radiosensitizer with re-challenge Lu-177-PSMA therapy (4 cycles). In a period of 3 years, the patient underwent a total of 8 cycles of Lu-177-PSMA with a cumulative dose of 51.8 GBq. All therapies were uneventful and well tolerated. There was a good response to re-challenge Lu-177-PSMA therapy and low-dose docetaxel (Taxol-Lu-177-PSMA) with no recorded tumour resistance.

The designed derivatives consist of either cinnamyl or 2-fluorocinnamyl moieties connected to 2-fluoropyridylpiperazines. The three-step synthesis starting from commercially available piperazine afforded the final products in overall yields between 9% and 29%. An in vitro competitive binding assay using l-[H-3]Deprenyl as radioligand was developed and the MAO-B binding affinities of the synthesized derivatives were assessed. Docking studies revealed that the compounds 8-17 were stabilized in both MAO-B entrance and substrate cavities, thus resembling the binding pose of l-Deprenyl. Although our results revealed that the novel fluorinated cinnamylpiperazines 8-17 do not possess sufficient MAO-B binding affinity to be eligible as positron emission tomography (PET) agents, the herein developed binding assay and the insights gained within our docking studies will certainly pave the way for further development of MAO-B ligands.

A large number of chemically diverse compounds that are able to modulate GlyR function both positively and negatively have been reported, which provides useful information for the development of pharmacological strategies and models for the allosteric modulation of these ion channels. Results: Based on existing literature, we have collected 218 unique chemical entities with documented modulatory activities at homomeric GlyR-alpha 1 and -alpha 3 and built a database named GRALL. This collection includes agonists, antagonists, positive and negative allosteric modulators and a number of experimentally inactive compounds. Most importantly, for a large fraction of them a structural annotation based on their putative binding site on the receptor is provided. This type of annotation, which is currently missing in other drug banks, along with the availability of cooperativity factors from radioligand displacement experiments are expected to improve the predictivity of in silico methodologies for allosteric drug discovery and boost the development of conformation-based pharmacological approaches.

Polymers included one of five functional monomers (acrylamide, hydroxyethylmethacrylate, methacrylic acid, 2-(triflouromethyl)acrylic acid, 4-vinylpyridine) and one of three porogens (acetonitrile, chloroform, methanol) combined with the crosslinking agent ethylene glycol dimethacrylate and initiator 2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionitrile). Polymers were characterized by nitrogen gas sorption measurements and SEM, and affinity studies performed using radioligand binding in various media. In agreement with the predictions made from the simulations, polymers prepared in acetonitrile using either methacrylic or trifluoromethacrylic acid demonstrated the highest affinities for oseltamivir. Further, the ensemble of interactions observed in the methanol system provided an explanation for the morphology of polymers prepared in this solvent. The materials developed here offer potential for use in solid-phase extraction or for catalysis. The results illustrate the strength of this in silico strategy as a potential prognostic tool in molecularly imprinted polymer design.	[Shoravi, Siamak; Olsson, Gustaf D.; Karlsson, Bjorn C.

We conducted a dopamine transporter (DAT) occupancy study with modafinil (200 or 300mg) in ten healthy volunteers using positron emission tomography (PET) with [F-18]FE-PE2I, a new PET radioligand with high affinity and selectivity for the dopamine transporter, to characterize its relation to abuse liability. Mean striatal DAT occupancies were 51.4% at 200mg and 56.9% at 300mg. There was a significant correlation between occupancy and plasma concentration, indicating dose dependency of DAT inhibition by modafinil in the striatum, and especially in the nucleus accumbens. This study showed that DAT occupancy by modafinil was close to that of methylphenidate, indicating that modafinil may be near the same level as methylphenidate in relation to abuse liability in terms of dopaminergic transmission.

The high-resolution fractionation tailors the fractionation frequency to the chromatographic peaks. Postcolumn reagents for AChBP bioaffinity profiling are mixed prior to droplet ejection into 1536-well plates. After an incubation step, microplate reader analysis is used to determine bioactive compounds in a mixture. For ligands tested, a good correlation was found for IC(50)s determined in flow injection analysis mode when compared with traditional radioligand binding assays. After the evaluation and validation, bioaffinity profiling of actual mixtures was performed. The advantage of this "atline" technology using postcolumn bioaffinity analysis when compared to continuous flow online postcolumn bioaffinity profiling is the possibility to choose postcolumn incubation times freely without compromising resolution due to diffusion effects.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensor Based Fragment Screening Using Acetylcholine Binding Protein Identifies Ligand Efficiency Hot Spots (LE Hot Spots) by Deconstruction of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor α7 Ligands	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DRUG DISCOVERY; DOCKING; TARGETS; INHIBITORS; AGONISTS; REVEALS; LIBRARY; DESIGN; SAR	The soluble acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) is a homologue of the ligand-binding domain of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). To guide future fragment-screening using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technology as a label-free, direct binding, biophysical screening assay, a focused fragment library was generated based on deconstruction of a set of alpha 7 nAChR selective quinuclidine containing ligands with nanomolar affinities. The interaction characteristics of the fragments and the parent compounds with AChBP) were evaluated using an SPR biosensor assay. The data obtained from this direct binding assay correlated well with data from the reference radioligand displacement assay. Ligand efficiencies for different (structural) groups of fragments in the library were correlated to binding with distinct regions of the binding pocket, thereby identifying ligand efficiency hot spots (LE hot spots). These hot spots can be used to identity the most promising hit fragments in a large scale fragment library screen.

Most of N6-substituted-4'-thioadenosines were less potent in binding than the corresponding N-6-substituted-adenosines or N-6-substituted-4'thioadenosine-5'-uronamides. N-6-(3-lodobenzyl) derivative 19g was demonstrated to be an A(3)AR-selective partial agonist displaying a Ki value of 3.2 nM. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, selective imaging agents for the D-4 subtype are badly needed. Based on the structure-activity analysis of chromeno[3,4-c]pyridin-5-ones as dopamine D-4 receptor ligands, two fluorine-18 labelled chromeno[3,4-c] pyridin-5-one derivatives, 3-(4-[F-18] fluorobenzyl)-8-hydroxy- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydrochromeno[3,4-c]pyridin-5-one and 3-(4-[F-18]fluorobenzyl)-8,9-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrochromenol[3,4-c]pyridin-5-one were synthesized through a two-step one-pot method. Their radiochemical yields were around 19.7% (decay - corrected) and radiochemical purities were higher than 95% with specific activities of about 120 GBq/mu mol.

We report here the first efficient method to purify human alpha (2)-adrenergic receptor subtype C2 to homogeneity from recombinant yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by one-step purification using a monoclonal antibody column (specific for alpha (2)C2). We show that the adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine stabilized the receptor during purification. We used a very effective chaotropic agent, NaSCN, to elute the receptor from the immunoaffinity column with an overall yield of 34% before reconstitution. Ligand binding of detergent-solubilized, immunoaffinity-purified receptors could not be demonstrated, but partial recovery of ligand binding activity was achieved when purified receptors were reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles. The reconstituted receptors still bound radioligand after storage on ice for 4 weeks. This purification procedure can be easily scaled-up and thus demonstrates the utility of a monoclonal antibody column and NaSCN elution to purify large quantities of G-protein-coupled receptors.

In vivo distribution studies in mice demonstrated good blood brain permeability but essentially uniform regional brain distribution and no evidence of specific binding to nicotinic cholinergic receptors. Identical results were obtained in an imaging study performed in a monkey brain. Therefore, despite literature reports supporting the use of metanicotine as a cognition enhancing nicotinic agonist, (E)-N-[C-11]methyl-4-(3-pyridinyl)-3-butene-1-amine does not appear to be a suitable candidate for in vivo imaging studies of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the mammalian brain.

EC50 values were determined for cyclic AMP production in CHO cells expressing human A(2B) receptors. Binding affinities were determined for rat A(1) and A(2A) receptors and human A(3) receptors. N-6-phenyladenosine displayed an EC50 value at A(2B) receptors of 6.3 mu M. Several N-6-phenyladenosine derivatives were more active than N-6-phenyladenosine, while two analogs were also more potent than 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA, 0.76 mu M), i.e., the -4-iodophenyl (10, 0.37 mu M) and the 4-aminosulfonylphenyl (20, 0.44 mu M) derivatives.

A constitutive heterozygous reduction in GLS1 engenders in mice a model of schizophrenia resilience and associated increases in Gln, reductions in Glu and activity-dependent attenuation of excitatory synaptic transmission. Hippocampal brain slices from GLS1 heterozygous mice metabolize less Gln to Glu. Whether glutaminase activity is diminished in the intact brain in GLS1 heterozygous mice has not been assessed, nor the regional impact. Moreover, it is not known whether pharmacological inhibition would mimic the genetic reduction. We addressed this using magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess amino acid content and C-13-acetate loading to assess glutaminase activity, in multiple brain regions. Glutaminase activity was reduced significantly in the hippocampus of GLS1 heterozygous mice, while acute treatment with the putative glutaminase inhibitor ebselen did not impact glutaminase activity, but did significantly increase GABA. This approach identifies a molecular imaging strategy for testing target engagement by comparing genetic and pharmacological inhibition, across brain regions.

In this study, we report the discovery of a novel proline scaffold with antagonistic activity at the NPFF receptors through a high throughput screening campaign using a functional calcium mobilization assay. Focused structure-activity relationship studies on the initial hit 1 have resulted in several analogs with calcium mobilization potencies in the submicromolar range and modest selectivity for the NPFF1 receptor. Affinities and potencies of these compounds were confirmed in radioligand binding and functional cAMP assays. Two compounds, 16 and 33, had good solubility and blood-brain barrier permeability that fall within the range of CNS permeant candidates without the liability of being a P-glycoprotein substrate. Finally, both compounds reversed fentanyl-induced hyperalgesia in rats when administered intraperitoneally. Together, these results point to the potential of these proline analogs as promising NPFF receptor antagonists.

The effects of location of 8-phenyl substitutions on the adenosine receptor (AR) binding affinities of the newly synthesized xanthines have also been studied. The compounds displayed moderate to potent binding affinities toward various adenosine receptor subtypes when evaluated through radioligand binding studies. However, most of the compounds showed the maximum affinity for the A(2A) subtype, some with high selectivity versus all other subtypes. Xanthine carboxylate amide 13b with a diethylaminoethylamino moiety at the para-position of the 8-phenylxanthine scaffold was identified as the most potent A(2A) adenosine receptor ligand with K-i = 0.06 mu M. Similarly potent and highly A(2A)-selective are the isovanillin derivatives 16a and 16d. In addition, the newly synthesized xanthine derivatives showed good in vivo bronchospasmolytic activity when tested in guinea pigs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

GnRH agonist reduces estrogen receptor dimerization in GT1-7 cells: Evidence for cross-talk between membrane-initiated estrogen and GnRH signaling	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						GT1-7 cells; Estradiol; Non-classical estrogen signaling; Estrogen receptor alpha; Estrogen receptor beta; GnRH receptor	RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; LHRH MESSENGER-RNA; HORMONE NEURONS; RAPID ACTION; ER ALPHA; ESTRADIOL; BINDING; MECHANISM; PHOSPHORYLATION; EXPRESSION	17 beta-estradiol (E-2), a key participant on the initiation of the LH surge, exerts both positive and negative feedback on GnRH neurons. We sought to investigate potential interactions between estrogen receptors alpha (ER alpha) and beta (ER beta) and gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R) in GT1-7 cells. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated a significant decrease in saturation E-2 binding in cells treated with GnRH agonist. Conversely, there was a significant reduction in GnRH binding in GT1-7 cells treated with E-2. In BRET1 experiments, ER alpha-ER alpha dimerization was suppressed in GT1-7 cells treated with GnRH agonist (p < 0.05). There was no evidence of direct interaction between ERs and GnRH-R. This study provides the first evidence of reduced ERa homodimerization by GnRH agonist. Collectively, these findings demonstrate significant cross-talk between membrane-initiated GnRH and E-2 signaling in GT1-7 cells. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Synthesis and <i>in vitro</i>/<i>in vivo</i> pharmacological evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]-ThioABP, a novel radiotracer for imaging mGluR5 with PET	MEDCHEMCOMM			English	Article							METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; SUBTYPE-5 RECEPTORS; IN-VITRO; C-11-ABP688; LOCALIZATION; RADIOLIGAND; ABP688; LIGAND	We have designed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, [C-11]-ThioABP, a thiazole based derivative for imaging the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5), and prepared the hydroxy oxime precursor 4 in a 15% overall yield. [C-11]-ThioABP was radiosynthesized in the Veenstra module and obtained in a decay corrected radiochemical yield of 40% and specific activity of 80-250 GBq mu mol(-1) at the end of synthesis. ThioABP exhibited excellent binding affinity (K-i) in vitro of 1.9 +/- 0.9 nM and [C-11]-ThioABP showed an optimal log D-7.4 of 2.4. The autoradiographic studies on rat brain slices revealed specific binding to mGluR5. In vivo evaluation of [C-11]-ThioABP including a displacement study with MMPEP in a dynamic PET scan showed a specificity of [C-11]-ThioABP for mGluR5. Radio-TLC metabolite studies showed a good metabolic stability of [C-11]-ThioABP in vivo. The comparison of biological properties of [C-11]-ThioABP and [C-11]-ABP688 revealed similarity between these two compounds.

N- and c-terminal extensions of μ-conotoxins increase potency and selectivity for neuronal sodium channels	BIOPOLYMERS			English	Article						mu-conotoxin; radioligand binding; NMR spectroscopy; solution structure; sodium channel	COMMON AMINO-ACIDS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; CONUS-STRIATUS; INHIBITOR	mu-Conotoxins are peptide blockers of voltage-gated sodium channels (sodium channels), inhibiting tetrodotoxin-sensitive neuronal (Nav1.2) and skeletal (Nav1.4) subtypes with highest affinity. Structure-activity relationship studies of mu-conotoxins SIIIA, TIIIA, and KIIIA have shown that it is mainly the C-terminal part of the three-loop peptide that is involved in binding to the sodium channel. In this study, we characterize the effect of N- and C-terminal extensions of mu-conotoxins SIIIA, SIIIB, and TIIIA on their potency and selectivity for neuronal versus muscle sodium channels. Interestingly, extending the N- or C-terminal of the peptide by introducing neutral, positive, and/or negatively charged residues, the selectivity of the native peptide can be altered from neuronal to skeletal and the other way around. The results from this study provide further insight into the binding profile of mu-conotoxins at voltage-gated sodium channels, revealing that binding interactions outside the cysteine-stablilized loops can contribute to mu-conotoxin affinity and sodium channel selectivity.

Among 9-subsituted derivatives, one showed much higher selectivity for the delta receptor in binding assays than the delta antagonist methylnaltrindole (6: K-i = 42 nM; mu/delta and kappa/delta > 238 on rat brain membranes) and antagonist properties. This compound was labeled with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) as a potential radioligand for the noninvasive assessment of delta opioid receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). A high yielding radiosynthesis of [C-11]-6, based on the [C-11]methyl introduction on the pyridine moiety by a Stille reaction, was described (radiochemical yield = 60 +/- 10%, specific activities = 0.8 to 1.5 Ci/mu mol). The in vivo pharmacological profile in rats indicated that the radiotracer crossed the blood-brain barrier but was not stable and underwent rapid degradation in both plasma and brain. No specific binding was consequently revealed.

The general structure of the new compounds is reminiscent of HEAT and RN5, two potent alpha(1)-AR antagonists which show high affinities for all three alpha(1)-AR subtypes. Some derivatives in which one ring of the tetrahydrocarbazolone system was opened were also prepared. Compounds were tested in radioligand binding assays on human cloned alpha(1A)-AR, alpha(1B)-AR, and alpha(1D)-AR subtypes stably expressed in HEK293 cells. They showed moderate to good affinities, although their selectivity among the receptor subtypes hardly reached one order of magnitude. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this new series of derivatives an arylpyrrolo moiety has replaced the indole nucleus of RN5. Several structural modifications were performed on the PPm and PPz moieties and the connecting alkyl chain. These compounds were synthesized and tested in radioligand binding experiments where many of them showed interesting binding profiles. Some compounds, including 31, 34, and 36, displayed substantial alpha(1)-AR selectivity with respect to serotoninergic 5-HT1A and dopaminergic D-1 and D-2 receptors. Two different molecular modeling approaches (pharmacophoric mapping and quantitative structure-affinity relationship analysis) have been applied to rationalize, at a quantitative level, the relationships between affinity toward alpha(1)-ARs and the structure of the studied compounds. Several QSAR models have been reported and described, accounting for the influence of various molecular portions on such affinity data.

The peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) is expressed on microglia and up-regulated after neuronal injury. [(11) C]PK11195 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for the PBR. The objective of the present study was to investigate [(11) C]PK11195 imaging in MS patients and its additional value over magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) concerning the immuno-pathophysiological process. Seven healthy and 22 MS subjects were included. Semiquantitative [(11) C]PK11195 uptake values were assessed with normalization on cortical grey matter. Uptake in Gadolinium-lesions was significantly increased compared with normal white matter. Uptake in T2-lesions was generally decreased, suggesting a PBR down-regulation. However, uptake values increased whenever a clinical or MR-relapse was present, suggestive for a dynamic process with a transient PBR up-regulation. During disease progression, an increase of normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) uptake was found, propagating NAWM as the possible real burden of disease. In conclusion, [(11) C]PK11195 and PET are able to demonstrate inflammatory processes with microglial involvement in MS.

The formation of each of these functional groups was carried out using N-N'-di(tert-butoxycarbonyl)thiourca and 2-methylthioimidazolinium iodide, respectively. These structures have been designed to incorporate two pharmacologic goals into one entity. Radioligand binding assays have been used to study their affinity for opioid (A, 5 and K) and 1(2)-imidazoline receptors. Two of them, 10 and 16, showed high affinity for mu opioid receptors and functionally they had moderate analgesic properties in the hot plate and writhing tests. The in vitro studies on guinea pig ileum (GPI) indicated that both compounds are mu opioid agonists. In what concerns 12-imidazoline receptor activity, these derivatives showed low affinity around 6 to 7 times less than idazoxan. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Karlsson, JG; Andersson, LI; Nicholls, IA				Karlsson, JG; Andersson, LI; Nicholls, IA			Probing the molecular basis for ligand-selective recognition in molecularly imprinted polymers selective for the local anaesthetic bupivacaine	ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	1st International Workshop on Molecularly Imprinted Polymers	JUL 03-05, 2000	CARDIFF, WALES	Welsh Sch Pharmacy, Cardiff Univ, Soc Molecular Imprinting		ligand; sorbent; molecularly imprinted polymer; radioligand binding arnal; solid phase extraction	SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION	Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are an interesting novel class of sorbent for analytical separation science, with one particular area of potential being in the development of highly selective solid-phase extraction systems. In order to optimise polymer-ligand selectivity and to examine the underlying physical mechanisms, polymers with selectivity for the local anaesthetic bupivacaine have been synthesised and their ligand-recognition characteristics examined. The influence of rebinding media parameters (pH, ionic strength, polarity) have been studied and optimised with respect to selective MIP-ligand binding, and the working range of the polymers with respect to these parameters has been mapped. These results highlight the robustness of MIPs and the breadth of potential assay conditions that may be employed. Finally, competitive binding studies using the closely related structures mepivacaine, ethycaine, ropivacaine and pentycaine in solvent mixtures of different polarity revealed that the entropy-driven hydrophobic effect is significant in polar solvents, whereas enthalpy-driven electrostatic interactions dominate in non-polar media.

Endothelin A receptor (ETA) overexpression in GSCs constitutes an attractive biomarker for targeting this cell subpopulation, as illustrated by several clinical trials evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of endothelin receptor antagonists against GBM. In this context, we have designed an immunoPET radioligand combining the chimeric antibody targeting ETA, chimeric-Rendomab A63 (xiRA63), with Zr-89 isotope and evaluated the abilities of xiRA63 and its Fab (ThioFab-xiRA63) to detect ETA+ tumors in a mouse model xenografted orthotopically with patient-derived Gli7 GSCs.ResultsRadioligands were intravenously injected and imaged over time by mu PET-CT imaging. Tissue biodistribution and pharmacokinetic parameters were analyzed, highlighting the ability of [Zr-89]Zr-xiRA63 to pass across the brain tumor barrier and achieve better tumor uptake than [Zr-89]Zr-ThioFab-xiRA63.ConclusionsThis study shows the high potential of [Zr-89]Zr-xiRA63 in specifically targeting ETA+ tumors, thus raising the possibility of detecting and treating ETA+ GSCs, which could improve the management of GBM patients.

During the development of the AQP4 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent [C-11] TGN-020 (N-(1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)pyridine-3-[C-11]-carboxamide), significant radioligand uptake was observed in the skull, where there was no known distribution of any aquaporin family proteins. Herein we confirmed via a newly developed method for bone-tissue immunohistology, a hitherto unrecognized distribution of AQP4, and not AQP1, in the skull. Other bony structures, by contrast, showed virtually no uptake of [C-11]TGN-020, and likewise, do not express either AQP4 or AQP1. Immunohistological analysis demonstrated that the AQP4 expression in the skull is restricted to the diploe. Consequently, we suspect AQP4 plays a pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of yellow marrow and the diploe. However, elucidating the exact nature of that role will require further studies.

Recent Findings Radioactive probes targeting PSMA hold promise in several malignancies in addition to prostate cancer, owing to the expression of PSMA by tumor neovasculature. The majority of clear cell RCCs (ccRCC), the most malignant RCC subtype, express PSMA on tumor-associated neovasculature. The endothelium of less aggressive RCC subtypes is PSMA positive in a lower, but still significant percentage of cases. PSMA might therefore represent an interesting theragnostic target in RCC. The preliminary data available suggest a potential role for PSMA-targeting radiopharmaceuticals in complementing conventional imaging for staging ccRCC patients at risk of nodal involvement and oligometastatic disease. Additional applications of PSMA imaging may be the selection and the response assessment of patients receiving anti-angiogenic treatments. The effectiveness of PSMA-targeting radionuclide therapy should also be investigated.

Radioligand binding assays showed that 2-(4-((2-butyl-5-nitro-1H-benzo[d] imidazol-1-yl) methyl)-1H-indol-1-yl) benzoic acid, compound 3, displayed a high affinity for the angiotensin II type 1 receptor with IC50 value of 1.03 +/- 0.26 nM. The biological evaluation on spontaneously hypertensive rats and renal hypertensive rats showed that 3 could cause significant decrease on MBP in a dose dependent manner, whose maximal response lowered 30 mmHg of MBP at 5 mg/kg and 41 mmHg of MBP at 10 mg/kg after oral administration, and the significant antihypertensive effect lasted beyond 24 h, which is better than Losartan. Taken together 3 could be considered as an effective and durable anti-hypertension drug candidate. These encouraging results are deserved of further investigation towards its use for therapeutic benefit. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, pharmaceutical compositions from plant extracts (family Marcgraviaceae) containing betulinic acid, have been patented as anxiolytic remedies. To extend our knowledge of the CNS effects of the triterpenes, we suggest here that the chemically related lupeol. betulin and betulinic acid may interact with the brain neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in vitro and in vivo. Using radioligand receptor-binding assay, we showed that only betulin bound to the GABA(A)-receptor sites in mice brain in vitro and antagonised the GABAA-receptor antagonist bicuculline-induced seizures in mice after intracisternal and intraperitoneal administration. Neither betulinic acid nor lupeol bound to GABA(A) receptor nor did they inhibit bicuculline-induced seizures in vivo. These findings demonstrate for the first time the CNS effects of betulin in vivo, and they also show distinct GABA(A)-receptor-related properties of lupane type triterpenes. These findings may open new avenues in understanding the central effects of betulin, and they also indicate possibilities for novel drug design on the basis of betulin structure.

This agent has proven to be active and specific against well established, subcutaneous folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors in multiple animal models. Recent structure-activity and optimization studies have yielded a disulfide bond-containing counterpart to EC140, herein referred to as EC145. This new conjugate was found to retain high affinity for FR-positive cells, and it produced specific, dose-responsive activity in vitro. Comparative in vivo efficacy tests confirmed that, like EC140, EC145 displays activity against both syngeneic and xenograft tumor models. However, EC145 was found to be more active and better tolerated than EC140; hence, more durable complete responses were consistently observed in EC145-treated tumor-bearing animals. Furthermore, EC145 was not found to be active against a FR-negative tumor model. Additional preclinical studies are therefore warranted to better understand EC145's breadth of activity against FR-positive tumors. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Using co-immunoprecipitation approaches, we demonstrated here that NTS1 forms constitutive heterodimers with NTS2 in transfected COS-7 cells. We also showed that co-expression of NTS2 with NTS1 markedly decreases the cell surface density of NTS1 without affecting ERK1/2 MAPK activity or NT-induced NTS1 internalization. However, radioligand-binding studies indicated that upon prolonged NT stimulation, cell surface NTS1 receptors are more resistant to down-regulation in cells co-expressing NTS1 and NTS2 than in cells expressing NTS1 alone. Taken together, these data suggest that NTS1/NTS2 heterodimerization affects the intracellular distribution and trafficking of NTS1 by making it more similar to that of NTS2 as witnessed in cells expressing NTS2 alone. NTS1/NTS2 heterodimerization might therefore represent an additional mechanism in the regulation of NT-triggered responses mediated by NTS1 and NTS2 receptors. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Such a radioligand may be of interest also for PET imaging, possibly enabling better visualization of even small metastases at late time-points after injection. The aim of this study was, therefore, to modify PSMA-ALB-56 by exchanging the DOTA chelator with a NODAGA chelator for stable coordination of Cu-64 ( T-1/2 = 12.7 h; E beta(+)(av) = 278 keV). The resulting NODAGA-functionalized PSMA-ALB-89 ligand, and the previously establish DOTA-functionalized PSMA-ALB-56 ligand were labeled with Cu-64 and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Both radioligands showed plasma protein-binding properties in vitro and PSMA-specific uptake in PC-3 PIP cells. Biodistribution studies, performed in tumor-bearing mice, revealed high accumulation of Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-89 in PSMA-positive PC-3 PIP tumor xenografts (25.9 +/- 3.41% IA/g at 1 h p.i.), which was further increased at later time-points (65.1 +/- 7.82% IA/g at 4 h p.i. and 97.1 +/- 7.01% IA/g at 24 h p.i.). High uptake of Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-89 was also seen in the kidneys, however, Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-89 was efficiently excreted over time. Mice injected with Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-56 showed increased accumulation of radioactivity in the liver (25.3 +/- 4.20% IA/g) when compared to the liver uptake of Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-89 (4.88 +/- 0.21% IA/g, at 4 h p.i.). This was most probably due to in vivo instability of the Cu-64-DOTA complex, which was also the reason for lower tumor uptake (49.7 +/- 16.1% IA/g at 4 h p.i. and 28.3 +/- 3.59% IA/g at 24 h p.i.). PET/CT imaging studies confirmed these findings and enabled excellent visualization of the PSMA-positive tumor xenografts in vivo after injection of Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-89. These data indicate that Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-89 is favorable over Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-56 with regard to the in vivo stability and tissue distribution profile. Moreover, Cu-64-PSMA-ALB-89 outperformed previously developed Cu-64-labeled PSMA ligands. Further optimization of long-circulating PSMA-targeting PET radioligands will be necessary before translating this concept to the clinics.

In this study, goldfish sst(5) receptors (gfsst(5)) were expressed and characterised in the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line, that harbours the luciferase reporter gene driven by the serum responsive element (CCL39-SRE-Luci). The agonist radioligands [I-125]-LTT-SRIF-28 ([Leu(8), DTrp(22), I-125-Tyr(25)]SRIF-28) and [I-125][Tyr(10)]cortistatin-14 labelled similar receptor densities with high affinity and in a saturable manner (pK(d): 9.99-9.71; B-max: 300-350 fmol mg(-1)). 5'-Guanylyl-imidodiphosphate inhibited radioligand binding to some degree (38.5-57.9%). In competition binding studies, the pharmacological profile of SRIF binding sites defined with [I-125]-LTT-SRIF-28 and [I-125][Tyr(10)]cortistatin-14 correlated significantly (r(2)=0.97, n=20). Pharmacological profiles of human and mouse sst(5) receptors expressed in CCL39 cells correlated markedly less with those of the gfsst(5) profile (r(2)=0.52-0.78, ngreater than or equal to16). Functional expression of the gfsst(5) receptor was examined by measurement of agonist-induced luciferase expression and stimulation of (S-35]GTP-gammaS ([S-35]guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) binding. Profiles were similar to those achieved in radioligand binding studies (r(2)=0.81-0.93, n=20), although relative potency (pEC(50)) was reduced compared to pK(d) values. Relative efficacy profiles of luciferase expression and [S-35]GTPgammaS binding, were rather divergent (r(2)=0.48, n=20) with peptides showing full agonism at one pathway and absence of agonism at the other. BIM 23056 (D-Phe-Phe-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Phe-D-Nal-NH2) acted as an antagonist on the effects of SRIF-14 (pK(B) = 6.74+/-0.23) on stimulation of [S-35]GTPgammaS binding. Pertussis toxin abolished the effect of SRIF-14 on luciferase expression and [S-35]GTPgammaS binding suggesting coupling of the receptor to G(i)/G(o) proteins. In summary, the present studies demonstrate that the gfsst5 receptor has a similar pharmacological profile and transductional properties to mammalian sst5 receptors. The difference in efficacy profiles defined using different functional assays suggests numerous, agonist specific, conformational receptor states, and/or ligand-dependent receptor trafficking.

The presented study focuses on the search for new antipsychotics by optimising the compound D2AAK3, a multi-target ligand of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), in particular D-2, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A receptors. Such receptor profile may be beneficial for the treatment of schizophrenia. Compounds 1-16 were designed, synthesised, and subjected to further evaluation. Their affinities for the above-mentioned receptors were assessed in radioligand binding assays and efficacy towards them in functional assays. Compounds 1 and 10, selected based on their receptor profile, were subjected to in vivo tests to evaluate their antipsychotic activity, and effect on memory and anxiety processes. Molecular modelling was performed to investigate the interactions of the studied compounds with D-2, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A receptors on the molecular level. Finally, X-ray study was conducted for compound 1, which revealed its stable conformation in the solid state.

Ligand autoradiographical quantification of histamine H<sub>3</sub> receptor in human dementia with Lewy bodies	PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Human; DLB; Psychosis; Globus pallidus; Histamine; H3R	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BRAIN HISTAMINE; BASAL GANGLIA; H3 RECEPTOR; ANTAGONISTS; POSTMORTEM; RAT	Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is a serious age-dependent human neurodegenerative disease, with multiple debilitating symptoms, including dementia, psychosis and significant motor deficits, but with little or no effective treatments. This comparative ligand autoradiographical study has quantified histamine H-3 receptors (H3R) in a series of major cortical and basal ganglia structures in human DLB and Alzheimer's (AD) post-mortem cases using the highly selective radioligand, [H-3] GSK189254. In the main, the levels of H-3 receptor were largely preserved in DLB cases when compared with aged matched controls. However, we provide new evidence showing variable levels in the globus pallidus, and, moreover, raised levels of Pallidum H-3 correlated with positive psychotic symptoms, in particular delusions and visual hallucinations, but not symptoms associated with depression. Furthermore, no correlation was detected for H-3 receptor levels to MMSE or IUPRS symptom severity. This study suggests that H3R antagonists have scope for treating the psychotic symptomologies in DLB and other human brain disorders. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

PBR111 has been labelled with fluorine-18 (half-life: 109.8min) using our Zymate-XP robotic system. The process involves (A) a simple one-step tosyloxy-for-fluorine nucleophilic aliphatic substitution (performed at 165 degrees C for 5 min in DMSO using K[F-18]F-Kryptofix 222 and 6.8-7.6 mu mol of the corresponding tosylate as precursor for labelling) followed by (B) C-18 PrepSep cartridge pre-purification and (C) semi-preparative HPLC purification on a Waters Symmetry C-18. Up to 4.8 GBq (130 mCi) of [F-18]PBR111 could be obtained with specific radioactivities ranging from 74 to 148 GBq/mu mol (2-4 Ci/mu mol) in 75-80 min (HPLC purification and SepPak-based formulation included), starting from a 37.0 GBq (1.0 Ci) [F-18]fluoride batch. Overall non-decay-corrected isolated yields were 8-13% (13-21% decay-corrected).

Given that Parkinson's disease (PD), like ischemia, is associated with cerebral lactic acidosis, we tested amiloride in the MPTP-treated mouse, a model of PD also manifesting lactic acidosis. Amiloride was found to protect substantia nigra (SNc) neurons from MPTP-induced degeneration, as determined by attenuated reductions in striatal tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine transporter (DAT) immunohistochemistry, as well as smaller declines in striatal DAT radioligand binding and dopamine levels. More significantly, amiloride also preserved dopaminergic cell bodies in the SNc. Administration of psalmotoxin venom (PcTX), an ASIC1a blocker, resulted in a much more modest effect, attenuating only the deficits in striatal DAT binding and dopamine. These findings represent the first experimental evidence of a potential role for ASICs in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Neurotensin receptor type 1:: <i>Escherichia coli</i> expression, purification, characterization and biophysical study	BIOCHEMICAL SOCIETY TRANSACTIONS			English	Article						fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET); G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR); in-gel fluorescence; neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTS1); solid-state NMR; surface plasmon resonance	SOLID-STATE NMR; PROTEIN	NT (neurotensin) is an endogenous tridecapeptide neurotransmitter found in the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. One receptor for NT, NTS1, belongs to the GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) superfamily, has seven putative transmembrane domains, and is being studied by a range of single-molecule, functional and structural approaches. To enable biophysical characterization, sufficient quantities of the receptor need to be expressed and purified in an active form. To this end, rat NTS1 has been expressed in Escherichia coli in an active ligand-binding form at the cell membrane and purified in sufficient amounts for structural biology studies either with or without fluorescent protein [YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) and UP (cyan fluorescent protein)] fusions. Ligand binding has been demonstrated in a novel SPR (surface plasmon resonance) approach, as well as by conventional radioligand binding measurements. These improvements in production of NTS1 now open up the possibility of direct structural studies, such as solid-state NMR to interrogate the NT-binding site, EM (electron microscopy), and X-ray crystallography and NMR.

Insect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor: Pharmacological and toxicological profiles of antagonists and agonists	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						antagonists AF-DX 384 and QNB; Drosophila; Musca; muscarinic acetylcholine receptor	FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BINDING-SITE; RAT-HEART; LOCALIZATION; SUBTYPES; CELLS	The insect muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) is evaluated as a potential target for insecticide action. The mammalian M2/M4-selective antagonist radioligand [H-3]AF-DX 384 (a pirenzepine analogue) binds to Drosophila mAChR at a single high-affinity site identical to that for the nonselective antagonist [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) and with a pharmacological profile distinct from that of all mammalian mAChR subtypes. Three nonselective antagonists (QNB, scopolamine, and atropine) show the highest affinity (K-i = 0.5-2.4 nM) at the Drosophila target, and AF-DX 384 and M3-selective 4-DAMP (dimethyl-4-(diphenylacetoxy)piperidinium iodide) rank next in potency (K-i = 5-18 nM). Eleven muscarinic antagonists generally exhibit higher affinity than eight agonists. On injection into houseflies, the antagonists 4-DAMP and (S)-(+)-dimethindene produce suppressed movement, the agonist (methyloxadiazolyl)quinuclidine causes knockdown and tremors, and all of them inhibit [H-3]QNB binding ex vivo, indicating possible mAChR-mediated intoxication. The insect mAChR warrants continuing study in lead generation to discover novel insecticides.

Radioligand binding studies showed that amentoflavone recognition paralleled that of the classical benzodiazepine diazepam in that it had little or no affinity for alpha 4- or alpha 6-containing receptors. Lysine and alanine substitutions at position 101 of the rat alpha(1) subunit resulted in a complete loss of competitive amentoflavone binding, but functional analysis of the alanine mutant expressed with beta z and gamma 2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes revealed no significant difference in the negative modulation of GABA-induced currents brought about by amentoflavone. Furthermore, elimination of the gamma subunit had no effect on the negative modulation of these currents. This negative modulation was also observed at alpha(1)beta(1)gamma(2) GABA(A) receptors and is therefore not likely mediated by the loreclezole site. These results suggest a complex mechanism of amentoflavone interaction at GABA(A) receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

Recent reports by our laboratory have demonstrated that the Fawn-Hooded rat demonstrates atypical neurochemical responses to CCK4, in vitro. Since the ability of CCK-B receptor ligands to modulate affective state is dependent on the putative receptor subtype activated, the aim of the present study was to examine the behavioural effects of the CCK-B receptor agonist, t-boc-CCK4, and the CCK-B receptor antagonist, Ci-988 in Fawn-Hooded and Wistar Kyoto rats. Interestingly, both t-boc-CCK4 and Ci-988 produced an anxiolytic profile in FH rats as determined by an increased time spent on the open arms of an elevated plus maze, while both drugs were devoid of any behavioural effect in WKY rats, lending further support to the theory that the FH rat strain has an atypical relative proportion of these putative subtypes apparently resulting in a predominantly CCK-B-2 receptor effect.

The method uses biotinylated alpha-cobratoxin (Bt-CTX) and is based on the ability of the N-terminal ligand-binding extracellular domain (LBED) of AChR to interact with alpha-cobratoxin (CTX) as does the whole receptor. LBED produced by heterologous expression of a gene fragment of the alpha7 subunit of AChR from the rat brain in Escherichia coli cells was sorbed in wells of a 96-well plate and incubated with Bt-CTX. The specifically bound Bt-CTX was determined by staining with streptavidin-peroxidase complex. The ability of other compounds to interact with alpha7-AChR was checked according to the degree with which they inhibit the Bt-CTX binding to LBED. Nicotine, carbamylcholine, d-tubocurarin, anabaseine, conotoxin ImI, and neurotoxin II were used as model compounds. The sensitivity of this method was comparable with that of the radioligand method (up to 10 pmol).

We therefore measured hippocampal serotonergic markers in post-mortem tissue from BD and control subjects. Methods: The density and affinity of [H-3]citalopram binding to the serotonin transporter (SERT), as well as the density of the 5HT(2A), 5HT(1A), 5HT(1D) and 5HT(1F) receptors were measured. Results: The density of SERT and 5HT receptors was no different in BD. There was a significant decrease in the affinity of [3 H]citalopram binding to SERT in the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (S-lac) in BD (K-d mean +/- S.E.M. = 4.3 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.9 +/- 0.3 nM). Limitations: This study was completed using relatively small cohorts. Conclusions: There are no generalised changes in hippocampal serotonergic markers in the hippocampus from subjects with BD. There is a decreased affinity of radioligand binding to S-lac SERT in subjects with BD. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

CPA, but not CCPA, induced phosphoinositide turnover. CPA inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production (EC50 value of 242+/-47 nM). CCPA competitively antagonized the effects of agonist Cl-IB-MECA (2-chloro-N-6-(3-iodobenzyl)-5'-N-methylcarbamoyladenosine) with K-B value of 5.0 nM.

The incidence of writhing produced by jinkoh-eremol, alpha -santalol and costunolide were revealed by administration of naloxone (mu-, kappa- and delta -antagonists). Inhibitory activities of alpha -santalol on opioid receptors were shown only by the delta antagonist, but not by the mu- and kappa -antagonists. The delta (2)-antagonist, but not the delta -antagonist, inhibited the activity of alpha santalol. The mechanism of inhibitory activity on the opioid receptor by alpha -santalol was different from that of morphine, alpha -Santalol was shown to be the most potent of the six as an antagonist of dopamine D-2 and serotonine 5-HT2A, receptor binding. The effect of alpha -Santalol, was the same as that of chlorpromazine as an antipsychotic agent, although a-santalol was less potent than chlorpromazine.

These opioid receptors have been characterized and cloned in several mammalian species. Radioligand binding techniques were employed to characterize the sites of opioid action in the amphibian, Rana pipiens. Naloxone is a general opioid receptor antagonist which has not been characterized in R, pipiens. Kinetic analyses of [H-3]naloxone in the amphibian yielded a K-D of 6.84 nM while the experimentally derived K-D value from saturation experiments was found to be 7.11 nM. Density data were also determined from saturation analyses which yielded a B-max of 2170 fmol/mg. Additionally, K-i values were calculated in competition studies for various unlabelled mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptor ligands to isolate their site of action. Highly selective antagonists for mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors yielded nearly identical K-i values against [H-3]naloxone. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

There is renewed interest in using psychedelics, including psilocybin, to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. Evidence suggests that psilocybin exerts its psychedelic, and possibly its clinical effects, through 5HT2A serotonin receptor (5HT2A-R) agonism. Intriguingly, reduced 5HT2A-R density in the neocortex is associated with cognitive impairment. Promisingly, the results of preclinical studies suggest psilocybin may promote synaptogenesis in brain regions associated with learning and memory, possibly facilitated by 5HT2A-R agonism. As such, psilocybin is worth exploring as a novel therapeutic for aMCI to counter neurogenerative disease progression. Using a double-blind-placebo controlled design, the proposed positron emission tomography study will assess whether psilocybin increases synaptic density, as measured by the radioligand [18F]SynVesT-1, in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of patients with aMCI, and if changes in synaptic vesicular density are associated with improvements in cognition.

Here, PIC and EDTA work as a vehicle for possible binding of requisite metal and acetamidobenzoxazolone pharmacophore (MBP) has been used as a specific binding probe for TSPO. In silico interaction analysis was carried out to assess MBP's binding efficacy towards the TSPO. TSPO is a protein that is known to be overexpressed during inflammatory conditions, therefore, during in vivo experiments, an LPS-induced lung inflammation mouse model was developed for the administration of Tc-99m-PIC-MBP and Tc-99m-EDTA-MBP to understand absorption and distribution in several peripheral organs over time through SPECT imaging. In addition, photophysical analysis with serum protein, i.e., bovine serum albumin (BSA) was also performed using different spectroscopic techniques to understand the in vivo transportation/excretion of these two probes PIC-MPB and EDTA-MPB to better understand the nature of these probes as specific diagnostic agents.

The synthesized compounds 1-8 were evaluated in radioligand binding (A(1), A(2A) and A(3)) and adenylyl cyclase activity (A(2B)) assays in order to determine their affinity for human AR subtypes. The 3-benzamide derivative 4 showed the highest affinity of the whole series and was more than 30-fold selective for the A(3) AR (K-i = 3.24 mu M). The current study supported that small structural changes in this scaffold allowed modulating the affinity resulting in novel promising classes of A(1), A(2A), and/or A(3) AR ligands. We also performed docking calculations in hA(2A) and hA(3) to identify the hypothetical binding mode for the most active compounds. In addition, some ADME properties were calculated in order to better understand the potential of these compounds as drug candidates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The compounds were obtained by reacting histamine with 2-(2-bromoethyl)benzaldehyde including an atypical Pictet-Spengler condensation, which afforded basic and not the usual neutral or acidic conditions. The resulting imidazo[4',5':3,4]pyrido[2,1-a]isoquinoline derivative 4 was Boc protected at the most basic imidazole nitrogen, the isoquinoline nitrogen then quaternized by using methyl iodide and the tetracyclic isoquinolinium salt was both deprotected and cleaved under Birch conditions in one step to give a tricyclic imidazo[4,5-f][3]benzazecine derivative (3) by opening two 6-membered heterocycles towards one 10-membered. Radioligand binding studies showed a significant affinity of the moderately constrained 3 but not of 4 for dopamine receptors. Similar to the analogous indolo-benzazecine LE300, a preference of 3 for the D-1 receptor family was observed, but with some loss of affinity over all.

Using a Type-I PDZ-binding motif in their distal C-terminal domain, alpha(1D)-ARs associate with syntrophins and dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) members utrophin, dystrobrevin and alpha-catulin. Three of the five syntrophin isoforms (alpha, beta(1) and beta(2)) interact with alpha(1D)-ARs and our previous studies suggest multiple isoforms are required for proper alpha(1D)-AR function in vivo. This study determined the contribution of each specific syntrophin isoform to alpha(1D)-AR function. Radioligand binding experiments reveal alpha-syntrophin enhances alpha(1D)-AR binding site density, while phosphoinositol and ERK1/2 signaling assays indicate beta(2)-syntrophin augments full and partial agonist efficacy for coupling to downstream signaling mechanisms. The results of this study provide clear evidence that the cytosolic components within the alpha(1D)-AR/DAPC signalosome significantly alter the pharmacological properties of alpha(1)-AR ligands in vitro.

All compounds were investigated with respect to their binding affinity for the SUR2B-type K-ATP channels using [H-3]P1075 as radioligand. Selected compounds were also tested as agonists in intact cells using DiBAC(4)(3) and DyeB (R7260) as membrane potential dyes. Remarkable affinity for SUR2B/Kir6.1 channels in the single-digit micromolar range was observed. In addition, benzothiazole-derived thioamides with sterically demanding, lipophilic substituents showed > 100-fold selectivity in favor of SUR2B/Kir6.1. A one-carbon spacer between the heterocyclic skeleton and the thioamide moiety was observed to be crucial for affinity and selectivity. Two of the most potent and selective compounds were studied by crystal structure analyses.

Receptors for gastrin-releasing peptide are overexpressed on prostate cancer cells offering a promising imaging target, and analogs of bombesin, an amphibian tetradecapeptide have been previously demonstrated to target these receptors. Therefore, the pan-bombesin analog [beta-Ala11, Phe13, Nle14]bombesin-(7-14) was conjugated through a linker to dye-functionalized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for the development of a new potential magnetic resonance imaging probe. The peptide was conjugated via click chemistry, demonstrating a complementary alternative methodology to conventional peptide-nanoparticle conjugation strategies. The peptide-functionalized nanoparticles were then demonstrated to be selectively taken up by PC-3 prostate cancer cells relative to unfunctionalized nanoparticles and this uptake was inhibited by the presence of free peptide, confirming the specificity of the interaction. This study suggests that these nanoparticles have the potential to serve as magnetic resonance imaging probes for the detection of prostate cancer.

Monodisperse droplets containing the monomers, template, initiator, and porogenic solvent were introduced into the microchannel, and particles of uniform size were produced by subsequent UV polymerization, quickly and without wasting polymer materials. The droplet/particle size was varied by changing the flow conditions in the microfluidic device. The diameter of the resulting products typically had a coefficient of variation (CV) below 2%. The specific binding sites that were created during the imprinting process were analysed via radioligand binding analysis. The molecularly imprinted microspheres produced in the liquid perfluorocarbon continuous phase had a higher binding capacity compared with the particles produced in the mineral oil continuous phase, though it should be noted that the aim of this study was not to optimize or maximize imprinting performance, but rather to demonstrate broad applicability and compatibility with known MIP production methods. The successful imprinting against a model compound using two very different continuous phases (one requiring a surfactant to stabilize the droplets the other not) demonstrates the generality of this current simple approach.

The purpose of this study was to examine measures of benzodiazepine receptor binding in PTSD. Method: From 13 patients with Vietnam combat-related PTSD and 13 case-matched healthy comparison subjects, a quantitative measure related to benzodiazepine receptor binding (distribution volume) was obtained with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of [I-123]iomazenil binding and measurement of radioligand concentration in plasma. Distribution volume image data were analyzed by means of statistical parametric mapping. Results: Lower distribution volumes were found in the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9) of PTSD patients than in comparison subjects. Conclusions: These findings of lower values for the benzodiazepine receptor binding measure of distribution volume are consistent with fewer benzodiazepine receptors and/or reduced affinity of receptor binding in the medial prefrontal cortex in patients with PTSD. Alterations in benzodiazepine receptor function in this area may underlie many of the symptoms of PTSD.

First-in-Human Evaluation of <SUP>18</SUP>F-SynVesT-1, a Radioligand for PET Imaging of Synaptic Vesicle Glycoprotein 2A	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; SV2A; brain imaging; kinetic modeling; synaptic density	SV2A	The use of synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A radiotracers with PET imaging could provide a way to measure synaptic density quantitatively in living humans. C-11-UCB-J ((R)-1-((3-C-1(1)-methy-C-11)pyrid in -4-yl) methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one), previously developed and assessed in nonhuman primates and humans, showed excellent kinetic properties as a PET radioligand. However, it is labeled with the short half-life isotope C-11. We developed a new tracer, an F-18-labeled difluoro-analog of UCB-J (F-18-SynVesT-1, also known as F-18-SDM-8), which displayed favorable properties in monkeys. The purpose of this first-in-human study was to assess the kinetic and binding properties of F-18-SynVesT-1 and compare with C-11-UCB-J. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers participated in a baseline study of F-18-SynVesT-1. Four of these subjects were also scanned after a blocking dose of the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam (20 mg/kg). Metabolite-corrected arterial input functions were measured. Regional time activity curves were analyzed using 1-tissue-compartment (1TC) and 2-tissue-compartment (2TC) models and multilinear analysis 1 to compute total distribution volume (V-T) and binding potential (BPND). The centrum semiovale was used as a reference region. The Lassen plot was applied to compute levetiracetam occupancy and nondisplaceable distribution volume. SUV ratio-1 (SUVR-1) over several time windows was compared with BPND. Results: Regional time-activity curves were fitted better with the 2TC model than the 1TC model, but 2TC V-T estimates were unstable. The 1TC V-T values matched well with those from the 2TC model (excluding the unstable values). Thus, 1TC was judged as the most useful model for quantitative analysis of F-18-SynVesT-1 imaging data. The minimum scan time for stable V-T measurement was 60 min. The rank order of V-T and BP ND was similar between F-18-SynVesT-1 and 11 C-UCB-J. Regional V-T was slightly higher for 11 C-UCB-J, but BP ND was higher for F-18-SynVesT1 , though these differences were not significant. Levetiracetam reduced the uptake of F-18-SynVesT-1 in all regions and produced occupancy of 85.7%. The SUVR-1 of F-18-SynVesT-1 from 60 to 90 min matched best with 1TC BPND. Conclusion: The novel synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A tracer, F-18-SynVesT-1, displays excellent kinetic and in vivo binding properties in humans and holds great potential for the imaging and quantification of synaptic density in neuropsychiatric disorders.

It is involved in mood disorders and is studied as a target for antidepressants. Because no radioligand has yet been successfully used to study this receptor by PET neuroimaging, the objective of the present study was to develop a 5-HT7 F-18-labeled radiotracer. Methods: Four structural analogs of SB269970, a specific 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, were synthesized. The nitro precursors of these analogs were radiolabeled by F-18 nucleophilic substitution. Analog antagonist effects were investigated by cellular functional assay. The cerebral distribution of radiolabeled molecules was studied by in vitro autoradiography in rats, and respective selectivity was determined by competition with the 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB269970 at different concentrations. Ex vivo small-animal PET studies in rats and in vivo PET studies in cats focused on the 1-(2-{(2R)-1-[(fluorophenyl)sulfonyl] pyrrolidin-2-yl} ethyl)-4-methylpiperidine (FP3) series. Results: Four analogs were synthesized from the SB269970 pharmacophore and divided into an FP3 (F-18-4FP3 and F-18-2FP3) and an 1-(2-{(2R)-1-[(fluorophenyl)sulfonyl] pyrrolidin-2-yl} ethyl)-4-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine (FPMP) (F-18-2FPMP and F-18-4FPMP) series. The chemical and radiochemical purities of the 4 radiolabeled molecules were greater than 98%. All presented suitable affinity for 5-HT7 (apparent dissociation constant [K-D] between 1.6 and 14 nM), although the FPMP series showed moderate agonist activity for 5-HT1A receptors. Lipophilicity values were predictive of good radiotracer blood-brain barrier penetration (logD from 1.4 to 3.9). In vitro competition with a 5-HT7 antagonist, SB269970, revealed that only radioligands from the FP3 series were displaced by the 5-HT7-specific antagonist: subsequent in vivo study, therefore, focused on this series. Ex vivo F-18-4FP3 and F-18-2FP3 autoradiography was in accordance with the 5-HT7 brain distribution, with few brain radioactive metabolites. PET scans in cats showed that pretreatment with a 5-HT7 antagonist significantly reduced F-18-2FP3 but not F-18-4FP3 binding. Conclusion: The 4 PET radiotracers had suitable characteristics for 5-HT7 receptor probing in vitro, although the FP3 series seemed to be more specific for in vivo imaging of 5-HT7 receptors. In particular, on the basis of the in vivo results, F-18-2FP3 appears to be the first PET radiotracer to enable in vivo imaging of 5-HT7 receptors in animal models, possibly leading to neuroimaging studies in humans.

Synthesis of full-length homodimer αD-VxXXB that targets human α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	RSC MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN CHEMICAL-SYNTHESIS; LIGATION; CONOTOXINS; CYSTEINE	alpha D-Conotoxin VxXXB is a pseudo-homodimer that allosterically inhibits nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with high potency and selectivity. However, challenges in synthesizing alpha D-conotoxins have hindered further structure-function studies on this novel class of peptides. To address this gap, we synthesized and characterized its C-terminal domain (CTD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). The CTD inhibited alpha 7 nAChRs (IC50 of 23 nM, measured via FLIPR assays) and bound at the acetylcholine binding protein (Ls-AChBP) through an allosteric binding mode determined from radioligand binding assays. The anti-parallel dimeric NTD synthesised via a regioselective strategy also inhibited alpha 7 nAChRs but with reduced potency (IC50 of 30 mu M). The alpha-ketoacid-hydroxylamine (KAHA) method generated CTD linked to the NTD (VxXXB-NC; alpha 7 IC50 of 27 nM) and full-length synthetic VxXXB variant (alpha 7 IC50 of 11 nM), while the three other native chemical ligation approaches proved unsuccessful. This work underpins further characterisation of the structural components contributing to alpha D-conotoxin affinity, selectivity and allosteric inhibition of nAChR function that may prove useful in the development of new treatments for nAChR-related disorders.

This preliminary study evaluates human AD and transgenic P301L mouse brain tissues using the GSK-3-targeting radiotracers [H-3]PF-367 and [H-3]OCM-44 in radioligand binding assays. A saturation analysis showed decreased GSK-3 density in female human AD compared to a normal healthy brain. Equivalence in density (B-max), affinity (K-d), and apparent affinity (K-i) of both radiotracers was demonstrated to enable their interchangeability for in vitro evaluations of GSK-3 expression. An evaluation of P301L mouse brain by [H-3]/[C-11]OCM-44 delineated differences in the B-max of GSK-3 between the control and transgenic mice within male subjects. PET imaging showed similar trends to those observed in vitro. Sex differences are revealed as a potential parameter to consider in the development of GSK-3-targeted diagnostics and therapeutics and could guide recruitment for clinical studies.

Imaging synaptic density in the living human brain	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							VESICLE PROTEIN 2A; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BINDING CHARACTERISTICS; PET TRACER; SV2A LIGAND; EXPRESSION; SYNAPTOPHYSIN; LEVETIRACETAM; GLYCOPROTEIN; EPILEPTOGENESIS	Chemical synapses are the predominant neuron-to-neuron contact in the central nervous system. Presynaptic boutons of neurons contain hundreds of vesicles filled with neurotransmitters, the diffusible signaling chemicals. Changes in the number of synapses are associated with numerous brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. However, all current approaches for measuring synaptic density in humans require brain tissue from autopsy or surgical resection. We report the use of the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) radioligand [C-11]UCB-J combined with positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify synaptic density in the living human brain. Validation studies in a baboon confirmed that SV2A is an alternative synaptic density marker to synaptophysin. First-in-human PET studies demonstrated that [C-11]UCB-J had excellent imaging properties. Finally, we confirmed that PET imaging of SV2A was sensitive to synaptic loss in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Thus, [C-11]UCB-J PET imaging is a promising approach for in vivo quantification of synaptic density with several potential applications in diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring of neurological and psychiatric disorders.

Among many reasons for this includes an inefficient transition from preclinical to clinical phases, which exponentially increase the cost and the delays the process of drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a nuclear imaging technique that has been used for the diagnosis, risk stratification, and guidance of therapy. However, lately with the advance of radiochemistry and of molecular imaging technology, it became evident that PET could help novel drug development process. By using a PET radioligand to report on receptor occupancy during novel agent therapy, it may help assess the effectiveness, efficacy, and safety of such a new medication in an early preclinical stage and help design successful clinical trials even at a later phase. In this article, we explore the potential implications of PET in the development of new heart failure therapies and review PET's application in the respective pathophysiologic pathways such as myocardial perfusion, metabolism, innervation, inflammation, apoptosis, and cardiac remodeling.

MS Binding Assays for the Three Monoamine Transporters Using the Triple Reuptake Inhibitor (1<i>R</i>,3<i>S</i>)-Indatraline as Native Marker	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article						binding assays; mass spectrometry; monoamine transporters; neurotransmitters; triple reuptake inhibitors	BIOGENIC-AMINE TRANSPORTERS; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENTS; SITE; MEMBRANES; POTENT; NOREPINEPHRINE; QUANTIFICATION; QUANTITATION	We herein present label-free, mass-spectrometry-based binding assays (MS Binding Assays) for the human dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters (hDAT, hNET, and hSERT). Using this approach both enantiomers of the triple reuptake inhibitor indatraline as well as its cis-configured diastereomer were investigated toward hDAT, hNET, and hSERT in saturation experiments. The dissociation rate constants for (1R,3S)-indatraline binding at hDAT, hNET, and hSERT were determined in kinetic studies. These experiments revealed an allosteric effect of clomipramine on the dissociation of (1R,3S)-indatraline from hSERT. Finally, a comprehensive set of known monoamine transport inhibitors and substrates was studied in competition experiments at hDAT, hNET, and hSERT, using (1R,3S)-indatraline as nonlabeled marker. The results are in excellent agreement with those reported for radioligand binding assays. Therefore, the established MS Binding Assays are a promising alternative to the latter for the characterization of new monoamine reuptake inhibitors at DAT, NET, and SERT.

The aims of this study were to examine the availabilities of the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) and the midbrain serotonin transporter (SERT) in patients with GAD. 12 patients with GAD and 12 sex-matched, age-matched, and smoking status-matched healthy controls were recruited. The availabilities of DAT and SERT were approximated using single-photon emission computed tomography, with [Tc-99m] TRODAT-1 and [I-123]ADAM as the ligands. There were several missing data for six participants with GAD in the ADAM study because of a lack of the radioligand at the time of the experiment. The DAT availability in the striatum was significantly lower in the patients with GAD than in the healthy controls. However, the SERT availability did not differ between the two groups. The results with respect to the striatal DAT level suggested a potential role in the pathophysiology of GAD. Copyright (C) 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

The binding site calculated for these flexible ligands was the hydrophobic Val18_Phe20 channel on the flat surface of A beta fiber. Structure activity relationship analysis generated a common trend that binding affinities declined significantly from para-substituted ligands to ortho-substituted ones, which was also quantitatively illustrated by 3D-QSAR modeling. Autoradiography in vitro further confirmed the high affinities of radioiodinated ligands [I-125]4, [I-125]24, and [I-125]22 (K-i = 24.3, 49.4, and 17.6 nM, respectively). In biodistribution, [I-125]4 exhibited high initial uptake and rapid washout property in the brain with brain(2 min)/brain(60 min) ratio of 16.3. The excellent in vitro and in vivo biostability of [I-125]4 enhanced its potential for clinical application in SPECT imaging of A beta plaques. This approach could also allow the design of a new generation of A beta targeting ligands without rigid and planar framework.

On a separate occasion, the same subjects underwent PET measurements using the radioligand [C-11] SCH23390 to determine dopamine D-1 receptor binding potential (BP) in caudate nucleus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The fMRI study revealed a significant load modulation of brain activity (higher load > lower load) in frontal and parietal regions for younger, but not older, adults. The PET measurements showed marked age-related reductions of D-1 BP in caudate and DLPFC. Statistical control of caudate and DLPFC D-1 binding eliminated the age-related reduction in load-dependent BOLD signal in left frontal cortex, and attenuated greatly the reduction in right frontal and left parietal cortex. These findings suggest that age-related alterations in dopaminergic neurotransmission may contribute to underrecruitment of task-relevant brain regions during working-memory performance in old age.

Recently, a variety of intracellular proteins have been identified to interact with carboxy (C)-termini of GPCRs, and control their intracellular trafficking and signal transduction efficiencies. Screening for such proteins that interact with the C-terminus of H3R resulted in identification of one of the chloride intracellular channel (CLIC) proteins, CLIC4. The association of CLIC4 with H3R was confirmed in in vitro pull-down assays, coimmunoprecipitation from rat brain lysate, and immunofluorescence microscopy of rat cerebellar neurons. The data from flowcytometric analysis, radioligand receptor binding assay, and cell-based ELISA indicated that CLIC4 enhanced cell surface expression of wild-type H3R, but not a mutant form of the receptor that failed to interact with CLIC4. These results indicate that, by binding to the C-terminus of MR, CLIC4 plays a critical role in regulation of the receptor cell surface expression. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The quaternary ammonium derivatives have a higher affinity with regard to the tertiary amines. 6,7-Dimethoxy analogues possess a higher affinity than the 6,8- and 7,8- dimethoxy isomers. A 3,4-dimethoxybenzyl or a 2-naphthylmethyl moiety in C-1 position are more favorable than a 3,4-dimethoxyphenethyl group. Smaller groups such as propyl or isobutyl are unfavorable. In 6,7-dimethoxy analogues, increasing the size and lipophilicity with a naphthyl group in the C-1 position leads to a slight increase of affinity, while the same group in the 6,7,8- trimethoxy series is less favorable. The 6,7,8- trimethoxy derivative 3f is the first tertiary amine in the series to possess an affinity close to that of N-methyl-laudanosine and N-methyl-noscapine. Moreover, electrophysiological studies show that the most effective compound 4f blocks the apamin-sensitive afterhyperpolarization in rat dopaminergic neurons.

It has been suggested that 5-hydroxy-1,7-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)1,4,6-heptatrien-3-one (curcumin) may be responsible for low age-adjusted prevalence of AD in India. In the present study, eight novel derivatives of curcumin and 4-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-3-buten-2-one (dehydrozingerone) were synthesized and their binding affinities for beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregates were measured. Of these ligands, fluoropropyl-substituted curcumin (8) showed the highest binding affinity (K-i = 0.07 nM), and therefore, 8 was radiolabeled and evaluated as a potential probe for A beta plaque imaging. Partition coefficient measurement and biodistribution in normal mice demonstrated that [F-18]8 has a suitable lipophilicity and reasonable initial brain uptake. Metabolism studies also indicated that [F-18]8 is metabolically stable in the brain. These results suggest that [F-18]8 is a suitable radioligand for A beta plaque imaging.

We have further characterised their functional effects using different preparations. MT1 and MT2 behaved like relatively selective muscarinic M-1 receptor agonists in rabbit vas deferens, but their effects were not reversed by washing or prevented by muscarinic antagonists, although allosteric modulators altered responses to MT1. Radioligand binding experiments indicated that both toxins irreversibly inhibited [H-3]N-methylscopolamine binding to cloned muscarinic M-1 and M-4 receptors, and reduced binding to M-5 subtype with lower affinity, while they reversibly inhibited the binding of [H-3]prazosin to rat cerebral cortex and vas deferens, with 20 fold lower affinity. High concentrations of MT1 reversibly blocked responses of vas deferens to noradrenaline. MT1 and MT2 appear to irreversibly activate muscarinic M-1 receptors at a site distinct from the classical one, and to have affinity for some alpha-adrenoceptors.

The binding profile of these compounds has been assessed by radioligand receptor binding assay at alpha (1)- and alpha (2)-adrenoceptors, in comparison to prazosin and rauwolseine, respectively. Moreover, structure-activity relationships have been derived for compounds 2-17 based on their fitting to a pharmacophore model for alpha (1)-adrenoceptor antagonists recently proposed by our research group. In a parallel way, the same compounds have been used to further test the predictive power and statistical significance of the model itself. The accuracy of the results obtained also in this case revealed the robustness of the calculated pharmacophore model and led to the identification of the molecular structural moieties which are thought to contribute to the biological activity.

Although there are many thriving fl-adrenergic receptors (fl-ARs) probes, none of them are selective to the fl3-subtype, which severely limits the development of fl3-AR investigations. Using a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain to conjugate the Py-5 fluorophore with mirabegron, we present here a highly selective fluorescent ligand, H2, for fl3-AR. It was established by the radioligand and NanoLuc-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) binding experiments that molecule H2 has a substantially higher affinity for fl3-AR than the other two subtypes (1/3, 45-fold; 2/3, 16-fold). More crucially, when molecule H2 was incubated with fl3-AR, the turn-on fluorescent signals could be quickly released. The subsequent investigations, which included cell imaging, tissue imaging, and flow-cytometry analysis, proved that molecule H2 may make it possible to quickly and accurately fluorescently identify fl3-AR at different levels. We offer a prospective fluorescent turn-on ligand with exceptional selectivity for fl3-AR as a result of our combined efforts.

Previously reported neurotensin-derived NTS1 ligands for PET were radiolabeled by modification and prelongation of the N-terminus of NT(8-13) peptide analogs. In this study, we demonstrate that modifying Arg(8) or Arg(9) by N-omega-carbamoylation and subsequent fluoroglycosylation provides a suitable approach for the development of NT(8-13) analogs as PET imaging agents. The N-omega-carbamoylated and fluoroglycosylated NT(8-13) analogs retained high NTS1 affinity in the one-digit nanomolar range as well as high metabolic stability in vitro. In vivo, the radioligand [F-18]21 demonstrated favorable biokinetics in HT-29 tumor-bearing mice with high tumor uptake and high retention, predominantly renal clearance, and fast wash-out from blood and other non-target tissues. Therefore, [F-18]21 has the potential to be used as molecular probe for the imaging of NTS1-expressing tumors by PET.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), which is markedly overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and metastatic sites but has low normal-tissue expression, has emerged as an important theranostic target for this disease. Both beta-emitting and alpha-emitting PSMA-targeted radionuclide therapy (RNT) are in clinical development. Several of these agents have already shown promising activity; however, a subset of patients have primary resistant disease, and secondary resistance invariably occurs. Further, the effect of these therapies on healthy organs limits their therapeutic window. Elucidating the biology of PSMA and characterizing the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of PSMA-targeted RNT and mechanisms of resistance will facilitate therapeutic approaches aimed at improving efficacy and safety. In this review, we provide an overview of existing PSMA-targeting RNT and novel RNT combinatorial approaches, such as those with novel hormonal agents, poly-[adenosine diphosphate-ribose]-polymerase inhibitors and immunotherapy, currently under investigation.

This often requires rapid arterial blood sampling. However, current catheterization procedures do not allow repeated blood sampling. We have developed a procedure which allows arterial sampling on repeated occasions in the same animal. Eleven male Wistar rats were two times catheterized via a superficial branch of a femoral artery and scanned with [C-11]MPDX and blood sampling. PET images were co-registered to a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) template. Regional tracer distribution volumes (V (T)) in the brain were calculated by the Logan analysis. The procedure was repeated after 1 week. Surgery was successful in 90 % of the cases, and discomfort was minor. The V (T) data showed small differences between test and retest, low between subject variability, and a strong agreement between and within subjects. Repeated quantitative imaging with a high reproducibility is possible with this approach.	[Sijbesma, Jurgen W.

Binding was optimal under physiological conditions of pH and temperature, and equilibrium was reached within 50 min. Specific binding for D-Asp and L-Glu was saturable, and Eadie-Hofstee analysis revealed interaction with a single population of binding sites (for D-Asp K-d = 860 +/- 28 nM, B-max = 27.2 +/- 0.5 pmol/mg protein; for L-Glu, K-d = 580 +/- 15 nM and B-max = 51.3 +/- 0.8 pmol/mg protein). L-[H-3] glutamate had higher affinity and a greater percentage of specific binding than did D-[H-3] aspartate. The pharmacological binding specificity of L-[H-3] glutamate indicated an interaction with NMDA-type receptors. Specifically, the order of potency of the displacing compound tested was L-Glu > D-Asp > NMDA > MK801 > D-AP5 > glycine. For D-[H-3] aspartate, the data revealed an interaction of D-Asp with either NMDA-type receptors or putative specific binding sites.

However, it is imperative that we understand the in vivo behaviour of these cells post-implantation. We report visualisation of iron oxide labelled bone marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) implanted into the striatum of hemi-parkinsonian rats by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Functional efficacy of the donor cells was monitored in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11]raclopride. The cells were visible for 28 days by in vivo MRI. BMSCs provided functional recovery demonstrated by a decreased binding of [C-11]raclopride. Although, histology confirmed the persistence of donor cells, no tyrosine hydroxylase positive cells were present. This suggests that BMSCs may have a limited paracrine effect and influence functional recovery. We demonstrate, using multimodal imaging, that we can not only track BMSCs but also establish their effects in a pre-clinical model of Parkinson's disease. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Platelet dopamine: D2 receptor binding in patients with migraine	CEPHALALGIA			English	Article						Migraine; platelets; H-3-spiperone binding; dopamine receptors; neurotransmitters	H-3 KETANSERIN BINDING; INCREASED DENSITY; ASSOCIATION; GENE; TRANSPORTER; AURA	Clinical, genetic and pharmacological evidences suggest an abnormality of the dopaminergic system in the pathogenesis of migraine. Direct evidence of an abnormal metabolism of dopamine in migraine, however, is lacking. Platelets are a useful model to understand brain dopaminergic mechanisms. The present study has been undertaken to study the status of platelet dopamine receptor binding by carrying out radioligand receptor binding assay. Binding of H-3-spiperone to platelet membranes, known to label dopamine (DA)-D2 receptors, was conducted in 20 patients with migraine and an equal number of healthy controls. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) in patients with migraine (1.71 +/- 0.19 nM) was found to be significantly lower (P < 0.001) as compared with controls (3.14 +/- 0.33 nM). However, no significant change was observed in the maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) in patients with migraine. No relationship of Kd with type of migraine, presence of vomiting, family history, frequency of attack, duration of illness and menstrual migraine was observed. The findings of the present study provide support for the involvement of the dopaminergic system in migraine.

The novel concept consists of a cell-free matrix achieved by deoxycholic acid treatment that is repopulated by host cells in vivo. Molecular biology, radioligand binding, and electron microscopy consistently showed that these valves are almost free of cellular components. Animal experiments and clinical investigations revealed excellent hemodynamic properties of the valves, no need for antithrombotic therapy, and repopulation by host cells without any signs of calcification. In juvenile sheep the internal diameter of the implanted valves significantly increased in growing animals by approximately 10 mm. The repopulation of the decellularized heart valves was found not only in sheep but also in humans, which indicates that the underlying mechanisms, presumably repair mechanisms, might be common in mammals. If these findings can be confirmed by others, they will lead to new concepts in the field of cardiovascular tissue engineering that will eliminate the need for in vitro construction of autologous heart valves.

It showed a potent and concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on platelet-activating factor (PAT) and arachidonic acid (AA) induced rabbit platelet aggregation. In a radioligand binding assay for the PAF receptor, alpha-bulnesene competitively inhibited [H-3]PAF binding to the PAY receptor with an IC50 value of 17.62 +/- 5.68 mu M. alpha-Bulnesene also dose-dependently inhibited PAF-induced intracellular Ca2+ increase in fluo-3/AM-loaded platelets (IC50 values of 19.62 +/- 1.32 mu M). Furthermore, alpha-bulnesene inhibited AA-incluced thromboxane B-2 (TXB2) formation and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) formation. These results indicate that the inhibitory effect of alpha-bulnesene on platelet aggregation was due to a dual activity; specifically the chemical blocked PAF-induced intracellular signal transduction and interfered with cyclooxygenase activity, which resulted in a decrease in thromboxane formation. This study is the first to demonstrate that alpha-bulnesene is a PAT receptor antagonist as well as an anti-platelet aggregation agent. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Opioid receptors were detected, quantified, and characterized in homogenates from capsule/synovium and periosteum using radioligand binding assays. Receptor binding of the nonselective opioid [(3)H]naloxone to tissue homogenates was stereospecific and saturable, showing similar characteristics to that of brain tissue, although with lower binding capacities. By immunohistochemistry, the neuronal occurrence of four different enkephalins was demonstrated in synovium, bone marrow, periosteum, and juxta-articular bone, whereas no neuronal dynorphin immunoreactivity was detected. Double-staining studies disclosed that enkephalins coexisted with substance P in primary afferent fibers. The applied techniques can be used to assess changes in the distribution of endogenous opioids and their receptors in joint tissues in conditions associated with pain and inflammation. The endogenous opioid system now demonstrated might be targeted and exploited therapeutically to obtain peripheral control of symptoms in joint disorders. (c) 2006 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Carbon-11 labeled fallypride may serve as a radiotracer for use in biomedical imaging technique positron emission tomography (PET). The precursor, 5-(3-fluoropropyl)-2-hydroxy-3-metboxy-N-[(2S)-1-(2-propenyl)-2-pyrrolidinyl]methyl]benzamide was synthesized from 2-hydroxy-3-methoxy-5-(2-propenyl)benzoic acid, methyl ester in seven steps with approximately 10% overall chemical yield. Using this precursor C-11-fallypride was produced by radiolabeling with C-11-methyl iodide in 25-40% radiochemical yields with specific activities of 200-1000 Ci/mmol. PET imaging studies in nonhuman primates with C-11-fallypride showed radiotracer localization in dopaminergic brain regions such as caudate, putamen, thalamus and cortex. This regional localization of C-11-fallypride is similar to that observed previously for F-18-fallypride. The results suggest C-11-fallypride is a useful PET radiotracer for imaging dopamine D2/D3 receptors. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Synthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a [<SUP>18</SUP>F] fluoromethyl-tanaproget derivative for imaging of progesterone receptor expression	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							BREAST-CANCER; ENDOCRINE THERAPY; ESTROGEN; PET; CARCINOMA; AFFINITY; ANALOGS; LIGAND	The estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) are over-expressed in similar to 50% of breast cancer lesions, and used as biomarkers to stratify patients for endocrine therapy. Currently, immunohistochemical (IHC) assessment of these lesions from a core-needle biopsy in deep-sited metastases has limitations associated with sampling error and lack of standardization. An alternative solution is positron emission tomography (PET)-based probes, which are inherently quantitative and capable of imaging the entire tumor, including metastases. This work features the synthesis and biological evaluation of a novel fluorinated derivative of tanaproget, a high affinity non-steroidal PR ligand, as a candidate for imaging PR expression in vivo. Radiolabeling of the candidate was achieved in a 15% +/- 4 radiochemical yield (non-decay corrected) in one step from [F-18] fluoromethyltosylate in 30 min. Cell uptake studies showed a significant difference between the radioligand uptake in PR+ and PR- cell lines; however, in vivo imaging was confounded by defluorination hypothesized to occur via iminium salt formation. Investigation into high affinity, metabolically stable non-steroidal PR ligands is currently ongoing.

Here, we compare the performance of two image-based methods of IF extraction to the ABSS gold standard method for the quantification of translocator protein (TSPO) in the human brain. The IFs were obtained from a direct delineation of the internal carotid signal (CS) and a new concept of independent component analysis (ICA). PET scans were obtained from 18 healthy volunteers. The estimated total distribution volume (V-T) by CS-IF and ICA-IF were compared to the reference V-T obtained by ABSS-IF in the frontal and temporal cortex, cerebellum, striatum and thalamus regions. The V-T values estimated using ICA-IF were more reliable than CS-IF for all brain regions.

Sleep deprivation differentially affects dopamine receptor subtypes in mouse striatum	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						autoradiography; dopamine; dopamine D(1) receptors; dopamine D(2) receptors; dopamine D(3) receptors; sleep deprivation	SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; HUMAN BRAIN; WAKE CYCLE; RAT-BRAIN; D-3; WAKEFULNESS; MICE; BINDING; STRESS	The effects of sleep deprivation on dopaminergic systems remain elusive, in part due to the lack of selective ligands for dopamine receptor subtypes. We examined D(1), D(2), and D(3) receptor density in the mouse brain after sleep deprivation by receptor autoradiography using [(3)H]SCH 23390 for D(1)R, [(3)H] raclopride for D(2)R, and [(3)H]WC-10 for D(3)R (a novel D(3)R-selective compound developed in our laboratory, not previously reported in mouse). Sleep-deprived mice showed a significant decrease in D(1)R, no change in D(2)R, and a significant increase in D(3)R binding in striatum. This pattern of dopamine receptor changes was not seen in mice subjected to restraint stress, suggesting specificity to sleep. These data provide evidence that brain dopaminergic circuits are remodeled after sleep deprivation. NeuroReport 22:489-493 (C) 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

To study the pharmacological activity of the enantiomers of 2, a preparative HPLC separation of (R)-2 and (S)-2 was performed. The absolute configuration of the enantiomers was determined by CD-spectroscopy together with theoretical calculations of the CD-spectrum of a model compound. In receptor binding studies with the radioligand [H-3]-(+)-pentazocine, (S)-2 was thrice more potent than its (R)-configured enantiomer (R)-2. The metabolic degradation of the more potent (S)-enantiomer was considerably slower than the metabolism of (R)-2. The structures of the main metabolites of both enantiomers were elucidated by determination of the exact mass using an Orbitrap-LC-MS system. These experiments showed a stereoselective biotransformation of the enantiomers of 2. Chirality 23:148-154, 2011. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

To study the biological basis for this co-morbidity, we compared GAERS, a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy, to non-epileptic control rats (NEC). Mature, 14-week old GAERS showed enhanced amphetamine-induced locomotor hyperactivity - a feature also present in young (6-week old) GAERS prior to epilepsy onset. Prepulse inhibition and its disruption by psychotropic drugs did not differ between strains, although GAERS displayed elevated startle responses at both epileptic and pre-epileptic ages. The frontoparietal cortex of GAERS displayed a twofold increase in the power of gamma (30-80 Hz) oscillations, a proposed neurophysiological correlate of psychosis. Radioligand binding autoradiography demonstrated reduced densities of dopamine transporters in the caudate nucleus and nucleus accumbens core and of dopamine D2 receptors in the caudate nucleus. GAERS provide an opportunity to study the neurodevelopmental, genetic and therapeutic aspects of psychiatric comorbidities associated with epilepsy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Design and methods: Platelets were obtained from 30 patients with FM. Evaluation of kinetic parameters of PBR was performed using [H-3] PK11195 as specific radioligand compared with 16 healthy volunteers. Results: The results showed a significant increase of PBR binding sites value in platelet membranes from FM patients (B-max was 5366 +/- 188 fmol/mg vs. controls, 4193 +/- 341 fmoUmg, mean +/- SEM) (**p < 0.01) but not for affinity value (K-d was 4.90 +/- 0.39 nM vs. controls, 4.74 +/- 0.39 nM, mean +/- SEM) (p > 0.05). Symptom severity scores (pain and tiredness) were positively correlated with B-max. Conclusions: Our results showed an up-regulation of PBR in platelets of FM patients, and this seems to be related to the severity of fibromyalgic symptoms.

In the present study, we performed a preclinical study. A suitable preparation method for [C-11]TMSX injection was established. The radiation absorbed-dose by [C-11]TMSX in humans estimated from the tissue distribution in mice was low enough for clinical use, and the acute toxicity and mutagenicity of TMSX were not found. The striatal uptake of [C-11]TMSX in mice was reduced by pretreatment with,theophylline at the dose of 10 and 100 mg/kg, suggesting that the [C-11]TMSX PET should be carefully performed in the patients received with theophylline. We have concluded that [C-11]TMSX is-suitable for mapping adenosine A(2A) receptors in the human brain by PET.

METHODS: 3AO cells proliferation was evaluated by viable cell count, activity of alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and tumor marker CA125 level were determined; the expression and regulation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) in 3AO cells was studied with radioligand binding assay. RESULTS: Dex inhibited the proliferation of 3AO cells accompanied by morphological changes in concentration- and time- dependent manner. AKP activity was increased and tumor marker CA125 was decreased in 3AO cells after treatment with Dex. The induction of AKP activity by dexamethasone was blocked by RU486, a potent glucocorticoid antagonist. There existed high affinity and low capacity of GR in 3AO cells, and the GR binding activity could be downregulated by Dex. CONCLUSION: Glucocortocoids play an important role in the reglulation of 3AO cell proliferation and differentiation. There existed functional GR in 3AO cells and the cellular effects of dexamethasone on 3AO cells were mediated by GR.

Hence, it is of interest to evaluate structure-affinity relationships for the purpose of making predictions. Methods: The affinity to P-gp of related molecular structures from various groups of drugs was determined using competitive radioligand-binding assays. Structural analogs, stereoisomers and metabolites of verapamil-type calcium antagonists, beta-adrenoceptor antagonists as well as omeprazole, omeprazole enantiomers and the sulfone metabolite of omeprazole were investigated. Results: Whereas some stereoselectivity was detected for the high-affinity P-gp substrates verapamil and carvedilol, little or no differences were observed in the case of other beta-blockers. One of the 4 labetalol stereoisomers, the R.R-isomer dilevalol, had an IC50 value half that of labetalol. Conclusions: Metabolites of verapamil, gallopamil, carvedilol and omeprazole are characterized by having higher IC50 values (lower P-gp affinity) than the respective parent compounds. Only the acebutolol metabolite. diacetolol, had a P-gp affinity comparable to that of the parent compound.

The radioligand works on the principle of tumor targeting through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect with a supportive role played by glucose metabolism. [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-2(Mal) (99 % RCP) exhibited high serum stability with immediate binding to serum proteins. In vivo experiments for comparison between tumor targeting of [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-2(Mal) and previous-generation [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-1(Mal) encompassed microPET/CT imaging and biodistribution analysis in an allograft E0771 breast cancer mouse model. Tumor uptake of [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-2(Mal) was clearly evident with twice as much accumulation as compared to its predecessor and a tumor/muscle ratio of up to 5 after 24 h. Further comparison indicated a decrease in liver accumulation for [Cu-64]Cu-Glu-CAB-2(Mal).

We successfully designed and synthesized the fluorinated and iodinated aurone derivative (3) and its radiolabels ([(125)I]3 and [(18)F]3). In binding experiments in vitro, 3 showed high affinity for A beta aggregates (K(i) = 6.81 nM). In brain sections of AD model mice, 3 intensely stained A beta plaques. Furthermore, a specific plaque labeling signal was observed on the autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections using [(125)I]3. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, [(125)I]3 and [(18)F]3 displayed good uptake into and a rapid washout from the brain, properties highly desirable for A beta imaging agents. These results suggest that 3 may function as a PET/SPECT dual imaging agent for detecting A beta plaques in AD brains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Ten female migraine patients and 24 female healthy volunteers underwent magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography using a radioligand antagonist of 5-HT1A receptors [4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-(N-2-pirydynyl)-p-fluorobenzamido]-ethylpiperazine (F-18-MPPF)]. A simplified reference tissue model was used to generate parametric images of 5-HT1A receptor binding potential (BP) values. Statistical Parametrical Mapping (SPM) analysis showed increased MPPF BP in posterior cortical areas and hippocampi bilaterally in patients compared with controls. Region of interest (ROI) analysis showed a non-significant trend in favour of a BP increase patients in cortical regions identified by the SPM analysis except in hippocampi, left parietal areas and raphe nuclei. During the interictal period of migraine patients without aura, the increase of MPPF BP in posterior cortical and limbic areas could reflect an increase in receptor density or a decrease of endogenous serotonin, which could explain their altered cortical excitability.

Radioiodinated aza-diphenylacetylenes as potential SPECT imaging agents for β-amyloid plaque detection	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HYPOTHESIS; PROBES	Two new iodinated fluoro- and bydroxy-pegylated aza-diphenyl acetylene derivatives, 1 and 2, targeting beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques have been successfully prepared. In vitro binding carried out in tissue hornogenates prepared from postmortem AD brains with [I-125]IMPY (6-iodo-2-(4'-dimethylainiiio)plienyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) as the radioligand indicated good binding affinities (K-i = 9.2 and 16.8 nM for 1 and 2, respectively). Brain penetrations of the corresponding radioiodinated ligands, evaluated in the normal mice, showed good initial brain penetrations (3.55% and 5.67% ID/g for [125 1]1 and [125 112 at 2 min post-injection). The washout from normal mice brain was relatively fast (0.33% and 0.91%) ID/g at 2 It post-injection). The specific binding of these radioiodinated ligands to beta-amyloid plaques was clearly demonstrated using film autoradiography of AD brain sections. Taken together, these preliminary results strongly suggest that these novel iodinated aza-diphenylacetylenes may be potentially useful for imaging A beta plaques in the living human brain.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether Ishikawa cells possess membrane melatonin receptors. Binding of the radioligand 2-[(125) I]-iodomelatonin to membrane preparations obtained from Ishikawa cells was detectable, saturable and stable. Scatchard analysis revealed that the dissociation constant (K (d) ) of the binding sites was 179.0 pm (similar to that of the MT2 [Mel(1b) ] melatonin receptor subtype), and that the concentration (B (max) ) of the binding sites was 12.9 fmol/mg protein. Luzindole, a selective MT2 melatonin receptor antagonist, significantly suppressed binding of 2-[(125) I]-iodomelatonin at all concentrations tested (10(-8) to 10(-4) m). These results suggest that the MT2 melatonin receptor subtype is present in the membranes of Ishikawa cells, and that the antiproliferative effect of melatonin on Ishikawa cells is mediated via the MT2 receptor. This may have implications for the use of melatonin in endometrial cancer therapy.

TRH did not influence specific binding of [H-3]-naloxone, but increased affinity of high affinity binding sites for the ligand in a dose-dependent manner. TRH also decreased affinity of low- affinity binding sites. Kinetic analysis of low-affinity binding sites suggests the existence of at least two subpopulations of OR, which differed in their affinity to naloxone and mode of interaction with TRH. TRH acted as non-competitive and competitive inhibitor of receptor binding sites with the lowest and moderate affinity, respectively. The allosteric pattern of TRH influence on OR with high and the lowest affinity to naloxone was suggested. TRH analogues were estimated for their ability to change in OR binding characteristics. The level of [H-3]-DADL specific binding was not influenced by the peptides tested but the affinity was changed. Blind control experiment showed the ability of the TRH relative substances to increase in affinity of d-receptors could be ranked in the row: dihydroorotyl-hystidyl-prolinamide>TRH>methionyl-asparagyl-phenylalaninamide. This is consistent with ability of these compounds to influence the dopaminergic events.

In suspensions of washed platelets, MRS2179 inhibited ADP-induced platelet shape change, aggregation and Ca2+ rise but had no effect on ADP-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Binding studies using the new radioligand [P-33]MRS2179 showed that washed human platelets displayed 134 +/- 8 binding sites per platelet with an affinity (K-d) of 109 +/- 18 nM. Finally, intravenous injection of MRS2179 resulted in inhibition of rat platelet aggregation in response to ADP and prolonged the bleeding time, in rats or mice, as compared to controls. These results suggest this potent P2Y(1) receptor antagonist to be a promising tool to evaluate the in vivo effects of pharmacologically targeting the P2Y(1) receptor with a view to antithrombotic therapy.

We studied the binding of novel compounds at the dopamine D-2 (D2R) and D-3 (D3R) receptor subtypes, which belong to the D-2-like receptor family. The synthesis, in silico, and in vitro characterization of 10 dopamine receptor ligands were performed. Novel ligands were docked into the D2R and D3R crystal structures to examine the precise binding mode. A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics study was performed to gain insights into the nature of the intermolecular interactions between the newly introduced pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) moiety and D2R and D3R. A radioligand displacement assay determined that all of the ligands showed moderate-to-low nanomolar affinities at D2R and D3R, with a slight preference for D3R, which was confirmed in the in silico studies. N-{4-[4-(2-Methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-(pentafluoro-lambda 6-sulfanyl)benzamide (7i) showed the highest D3R affinity and selectivity (pK(i) values of 7.14 [D2R] and 8.42 [D3R]).

Drug discovery projects generally benefit from a broad range of experimental approaches for screening compound libraries and for the characterization of binding modes of drug candidates. Owing to the difficulties in solubilizing and purifying GPCRs, assay formats have been so far mainly limited to cell based functional assays and radioligand binding assays. In this study, we used fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) to analyze the interaction of detergent-solubilized receptors to various types of GPCR ligands: endogenous peptides, small molecules, and a large surrogate antagonist represented by a blocking monoclonal antibody. Our work demonstrates the suitability of the homogeneous and time-resolved FCCS assay format for a robust, high-throughput determination of receptor ligand binding affinities and kinetic rate constants for various therapeutically relevant GPCRs.

In this work a new lactam bridge alpha-MSH analogue was synthesized and radiolabeled with Tc-99m via HYNIC chelator and tricine as co-ligand. Also, stability in human serum, receptor bound internalization and tissue biodistribution in tumor bearing nude mice were thoroughly investigated. Radiolabeling with Tc-99m was performed at high specific activities (163MBq/nmol) with an acceptable labeling yield (> 98%). The radioligand showed specific internalization into B16/F10 cells (13.35 +/- 0.9% at 4 h). In biodistribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake was observed in MC1 receptor positive organ so that after 4 h the tumor uptake was 4.51 +/- 0.11 % ID/g. Predominant renal excretion pathway with a highest accumulation of activity in tumor was observed for this radiopeptide. Obtained results show that the new designed labeled peptide conjugate can be a suitable candidate for diagnosis of metastatic melanomas.

The aim of this study was to develop [C-11]1 as a novel positron emission tomography ligand and to evaluate its binding ability for mGluR4. Using stannyl precursor 3, [C-11]1 was efficiently synthesized by introducing an [C-11]methyl group into a pyrimidine ring via C-C-11 coupling and deprotection reactions, in 16 +/- 6% radiochemical yield (n = 10). At the end of synthesis, 0.54-1.10 GBq of [C-11]1 was acquired with > 98% radiochemical purity and 90-120 GBq/mu mol of specific activity. In vitro autoradiography and ex vivo biodistribution study in rat brains showed specific binding of [C-11]1 in the cerebellum, striatum, thalamus, cerebral cortex, and medulla oblongata, which showed dose-dependent decreases by administration with multi-dose of unlabeled 1.

These compounds achieved up to 2500 times the potency of histamine when studied in [S-35]GTP gamma S assays on recombinant human and guinea pig H2R. Unlike 3-(imidazol-4-yl)propyl substituted carbamoylguanidines, the corresponding 2-amino-4-methylthiazoles revealed selectivity over histamine receptor subtypes H1R, H3R and H4R in radioligand competition binding studies. H2R binding studies with three fluorescent compounds and one tritium-labeled ligand, synthesized from a chain-branched precursor, failed due to pronounced cellular accumulation and high non-specific binding. However, the dimeric H2R agonists proved to be useful pharmacological tools for functional studies on native cells, as demonstrated for selected compounds by cAMP accumulation and inhibition of fMLP-stimulated generation of reactive oxygen species in human monocytes.

Small-angle neutron scattering was used to determine micellar structure and composition as a function of concentration of the various components, and radioligand binding was used as a sensitive probe for receptor activity. Micelles adopted an oblate ellipsoidal morphology and exhibited a reduction in size and change in curvature upon addition of CHS. Our results show a strong correlation between the number of CHS monomers per micelle and the activity of the receptor reconstituted in those micelles. Micelles that yield optimal human adenosine A(2)a receptor stability closely mimic the cholesterol composition and thickness of mammalian membranes. Thus, successful reconstitution of the receptor is dependent on both specific lipid-protein interactions and the geometry of the micelle environment.

(E)-3-((2-(Fluoromethyl)thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)cyclohex-2-enone O-methyl oxime (FTECMO), the ligand with the highest binding affinity (K-i = 5.5 +/- 1.1 nM), was labeled with fluorine-18. [F-18]-FTECMO displayed optimal lipophilicity (log D-pH7.4 = 1.6 +/- 0.2) and high stability in rat and human plasma as well as sufficient stability in rat liver microsomes. In vitro autoradiography with [F-18]-FTECMO revealed a heterogeneous and displaceable binding in mGluR5-rich brain regions. PET imaging with [F-18]-FTECMO in Wistar rats, however, showed low brain uptake. Uptake of radioactivity into the skull was observed suggesting in vivo defluorination. Thus, although [F-18]-FTECMO is an excellent ligand for the detection of mGluR5 in vitro, its in vivo characteristics are not optimal for the imaging of mGluR5 in rats in vivo. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Stereoselective coupling by Mitsunobu produced chirally pure analogues to study the effect of configuration, modification of the ester, and substitution in the phenyl ring, with the aim to probe specific sites for introducing a radionuclide. Iodophenyl metomidate (IMTO) labeled with iodine-131 served as radioligand for structure-affinity relationship studies. We have characterized the kinetic parameters of specific I-131-IMTO binding on rat adrenal membranes and used the displacement of I-131-IMTO binding to evaluate functionalized MTO analogues. Our results indicated that (1) (R)-configuration is essential for high affinity, (2) highest potency resides in the ethyl, 2-propyl, and 2-fluoroethyl esters, and (3) substitution of the phenyl ring is well tolerated.

Crude CDS from bovine lung was purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Electrospray mass spectrometry (ESMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (H-1 NMR) analysis revealed the presence of L-tryptophan and 1-carboxy-1- methyltetrahydro-beta-carboline in the active CDS extract. Competition radioligand binding studies, however, failed to show displacement of specific [H-3]clonidine binding to rat brain membranes for either compound. Further purification of the bovine lung extract allowed the isolation of the beta-carbolines harmane and harmalan as confirmed by ESMS, H-1 NMR, and comparison with synthetic standards. Both compounds exhibited a high (nanomolar) affinity for both type 1 and type 2 imidazoline binding sites, and the synthetic standards were shown to coelute with the active classical CDS extracts. We therefore propose that the beta-carbolines harmane and harmalan represent active components of classical CDS. The identification of these compounds will allow us to establish clear physiological roles for CDS.

We identified a novel substance HS131, with about 20-fold higher affinity for the MC4 receptor than the MC3 receptor. This substance proved to be antagonist for all the four MC receptors in a cAMP assay. HS131 is a six amino acid long peptide, has a molecular weight below 1000, and has only two amino acids in common with the natural MSH peptides. HS131 potently and dose dependently increased food intake after i.c.v. administration. Moreover, s.c. administration of HS131 (1.0 mg/kg) increased food intake, suggesting that HS131 may be able to pass the blood brain barrier. This cyclic low molecular weight peptidomimetic will enable studies of the functional role of the MC4 receptors by peripheral administration and it may be used as a template for further development of low molecular weight substances for the MC receptors.

All 12 tested compounds inhibited [3H]EPI binding, showing K-i values ranging from 14.6 to 6830 nM. The potency variation of para-substituted CBA analogues was explained by the steric (DeltaB(1)) and electronic (sigma(p)) parameters of the para-substituents, or by the steric parameter and the charge of the NI nitrogen atom (qN(1)). Among the CBA analogues. only two compounds containing a dimethylamino group and a methoxy group at the paraposition showed high insecticidal activity against the German cockroach (Blattella germanica) when injected after pretreatment with metabolic inhibitors. High-affinity analogues of CBA might be suitable probes for use in classifying and characterizing insect nAChR subtypes. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Re was used as Tc surrogate for chemical characterization and in vitro receptor-binding studies. For two representatives subnanomolar affinities for the 5-HT1A as well as for the alpha1-adrenergic receptor were reached. Biodistribution studies in rats of the Tc-99m complexes showed brain uptakes between 0.3 and 0.5% ID/organ (5 min p.i.). In vitro autoradiography of one Tc-99m representative in sections of post mortem human brain indicate its accumulation in 5-HT1A receptor-rich brain regions. However, addition of the specific 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT as well as the alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin could not substantially block this tracer accumulation. A preliminary SPET study in a monkey showed negligible brain uptake. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

EDG1 binds sphingosine-1-phosphate (SPP) with high affinity and lysophophatidic acid (LPA) with low affinity. A model has been developed, based on an experimentally based model of the structure of rhodopsin, to evaluate the features that contribute to the different binding affinities of phospholipids for EDG1. The residues predicted by the model to be important in binding have previously been reported. Twenty mutations expressed transiently in HEK293 cells were evaluated by radioligand binding assays and MAP-kinase assays of receptor activation. Seventeen of these mutations are well explained by the current model. The remaining three mutations and three additional control mutations have been modeled using molecular dynamics. Changes in the exposed surface areas of amino acids in the binding pocket reflect the changes in SPP binding observed for the modeled mutations. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We have also demonstrated that when the tryptophan residue is connected to the C- or N-terminal sides of the anthranilic acid dimer, compounds with similar micromolar CCK-A receptor affinities are obtained. In order to investigate the binding effects of different N-terminal substitution, in this paper we describe a new series of anthranilic acid dimer derivatives, characterized by the presence of the tryptophan residue in the C-terminus of the dimer. Among the compounds synthesized, the N-1H-indol-3-propionyl derivative exhibited an improved, at the micromolar range, affinity for the CCK-A receptor in comparison to that of either, the N-unsubstituted derivative and asperlicin. The lead compound emerging from this key step of our investigation represents the new starting point for the development of a new class of CCK-A receptor ligands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A.

The gold standard PET imaging agent for this target is [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635, labeled via a technically challenging multi-step reaction that has limited its widespread use. While several antagonist and agonist-based PET radiotracers for 5-HT (1A) receptors have been developed, their clinical translation has been hindered by methodological challenges and/or and non-specific binding. As a result, there is continued interest in the development of new and more selective 5-HT1A PET tracers having a relatively easier and reliable radiosynthesis process for routine production and with favorable metabolism to facilitate tracer-kinetic modeling. The purpose of the current study was to develop and characterize a radioligand with suitable characteristics for imaging 5-HT1A receptors in the brain. The current study reports the in vitro characterization and radiosyntheses of three candidate 5-HT1A receptor antagonists, DF-100 (1), DF-300 (2) and DF-400 (3), to explore their suitability as potential PET radiotracers.ResultsSyntheses of 1-3 and corresponding precursors for radiolabeling were achieved from isonicotinic, picolinic acid or picolino nitrile. In vitro binding studies demonstrated nanomolar affinity of the compounds for 5-HT1A receptors. Binding of 1-3 for other biogenic amines, neurotransmitter receptors, and transporters was negligible with the exception of moderate affinities for alpha (1)-adrenergic receptors (4-6-fold less potent than that for 5-HT1A receptor). Radioligands [C-11]1-3 were efficiently prepared by C-11-O-methylation of the corresponding phenolic precursor in non-decay corrected radiochemical yields of 7-11% with >99% chemical and radiochemical purities. Dynamic PET studies in rats demonstrated negligible brain uptake of [C-11]1 and [C-11]2. In contrast, significant brain uptake of [C-11]3 was observed with an early peak SUV of 4-5. However, [C-11]3 displayed significant off-target binding attributed to alpha (1)-adrenergic receptors based on regional distribution (thalamus>hippocampus) and blocking studies.ConclusionDespite efficient radiolabeling, results from PET imaging experiments limit the application of [C-11]3 for in vivo quantification of 5-HT1A receptors. Nevertheless, derivatives of compound 3 may provide a scaffold for alternative PET radiotracers with improved selectivity for 5-HT (1A) receptors or alpha (1)-adrenergic receptors.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 to 300 g) were gavaged with candesartan cilexetil or losartan in doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg, or corresponding vehicle. Rats were killed at 0, 1, 2, 8, or 24 h after drug administration, trunk blood collected, and kidneys removed. The effects of candesartan cilexetil and losartan on Ang II receptor binding were determined by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the radioligand [I-125]-[Sar(1),Ile(8)] Ang II. Ang II receptor binding in the kidney was mainly due to AT(1) receptors with high levels of binding localized to the inner stripe of the outer medulla and glomeruli in cortical regions. Candesartan cilexetil (0.1 to 30 mg/kg) inhibited Ang II receptor binding to all anatomical sites of the kidney, in a dose-dependent manner. Losartan (0.1 to 30 mg/kg) also produced dose-dependent inhibition of Ang II receptor binding but was approximately 10- to 30-fold less potent than candesartan cilexetil. Inhibition of Ang II receptor binding was near maximal about 1 h after administration of candesartan cilexetil (10 mg/kg) or losartan (10 mg/kg), with both drugs producing persistent blockade at 24 h despite plasma renin activity and plasma drug concentrations returning to near normal levels. In vitro, candesartan, losartan, and EXP3174 (1 x 10(-10) to 1 x 10(-5) mol/L) displaced [I-125]-[Sar(1),Ile(8)] Ang II binding from AT(1) receptors in the kidney in a concentration-dependent manner with a rank order of potency of candesartan > EXP3174 > losartan. The concentration required to displace 50% of radioligand binding (IC50) by candesartan, EXP3174, and losartan was 0.9 +/- 0.1 nmol/L, 3.4 +/- 0.4 nmol/L, and 8.9 +/- 1.1 nmol/L, respectively. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that candesartan cilexetil is more potent than losartan in antagonizing AT(1) receptors in the kidney in vivo. Nonetheless, both candesartan cilexetil and losartan produce rapid, complete, and sustained blockade of AT(1) receptors in the rat kidney. Tissue blockade of Ang II receptors in target organs, such as the kidney, may contribute to the beneficial effects of Ang II receptor antagonists as antihypertensive agents.

This study aimed to improve the affinity and tumor-targeting capabilities of new PSMA tracers by increasing the number of pharmacophores that specifically bind to PSMA. Using biphenyl as a core scaffold, we investigated the relationship among spacer segments, affinity, and pharmacokinetic properties. In preclinical PET studies on mice with 22Rv1 tumors, compared with [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 (SUVmax = 3.37), [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-D5 (K-i = 0.15) showed higher tumor uptake (SUVmax = 3.51) and lower renal uptake (T/K = 1.84). In the first-in-human study, [Ga-68]G-aPSMA-D5 effectively detected small PCa-associated lesions and distant metastases. The advantages of [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-D5 include high tumor uptake, straightforward synthesis, and labeling, making it a promising PSMA PET tracer. Furthermore, [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-D5 contains a DOTA chelator, allowing convenient labeling with therapeutic radionuclides such as Lu-177 and Ac-225, providing the potential for targeted radioligand therapy in PCa.

Herein we report on a new, practical synthesis of 6-amino-5-carboxamidouracils, the main building blocks for the preparation of 8-substituted xanthines, by condensation of 5,6-diaminouracil derivatives and various carboxylic acids using the recently developed non-hazardous coupling reagent COMU (1-[(1-(cyano-2-ethoxy-2-oxoethylideneaminooxy)dimethylaminomorpholinomethylene)]methanaminium hexafluoro phosphate). Optimized reaction conditions led to the precipitation of pure products after only 5 to 10 min of reaction time. The method tolerates a variety of substituted 5,6-diaminouracil and carboxylic acid derivatives as starting compounds resulting in most cases in more than 80% isolated yield. Regioselectivity of the reaction yielding only the 5-carboxamido-, but not the 6-carboxamidouracil derivatives, was unambiguously confirmed by single X-ray crystallography and multidimensional NMR experiments. The described method represents a convenient, fast access to direct precursors of 8-substituted xanthines under mild conditions without the necessity of hazardous coupling or chlorinating reagents.

Here, we determine whether berberine is an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), with a lipid-lowering effect. The cell-based reporter gene analysis showed that berberine selectively activates PPARalpha (EC50 =0.58 mM, Emax=102.4). The radioligand binding assay shows that berberine binds directly to the ligand-binding domain of PPARalpha (Ki=0.73 mM) with similar affinity to fenofibrate. The mRNA and protein levels of CPTIalpha gene from HepG2 cells and hyperlipidemic rat liver are remarkably up-regulated by berberine, and this effect can be blocked by MK886, a non-competitive antagonist of PPARalpha. A comparison assay in which berberine and fenofibrate were used to treat hyperlipidaemic rats for three months shows that these drugs produce similar lipid-lowering effects, except that berberine increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol more effectively than fenofibrate. These findings provide the first evidence that berberine is a potent agonist of PPARalpha and seems to be superior to fenofibrate for treating hyperlipidemia.

Both PD groups also showed higher binding than controls in the sensorimotor division of the striatum. In contrast, D-2/3 binding in the ventral striatum was lower in patients with LID than without, possibly reflecting higher dopamine levels.Conclusions:Dopaminergic abnormalities contributing to LID may include elevated D-2/3 binding in globus pallidus, perhaps reflecting D-3 receptor upregulation. The findings support therapeutic strategies that target and diminish activity at D-3 to prevent LID.

LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article							NITROUS-OXIDE ANTINOCICEPTION; BETA-ENDORPHIN RELEASE; RAT-BRAIN; METHIONINE-ENKEPHALIN; REGIONAL BRAIN; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HALOTHANE; NALOXONE; ISOFLURANE; ANTAGONISM	The antagonism of some effects of inhalation general anesthetic agents by naloxone suggests that there may be an opioid component to anesthetic action. There is evidence that this opioid action component is due to neuronal release of endogenous opioid peptides. The strongest evidence is provided by studies that monitor changes in the concentration of opioid peptides in the perfused brain following inhalation of the anesthetic. Indirect or circumstantial evidence also comes from studies of anesthetic effects on regional brain levels of opioid peptides, antagonism of selected anesthetic effects by antisera to opioid peptides and anesthetic-induced changes radioligand binding to opioid receptors. It is likely that some inhalation general anesthetics (e.g., nitrous oxide) can induce neuronal release of opioid peptides and that this may contribute to certain components of general anesthesia (e.g., analgesia). More definitive studies utilizing in vivo microdialysis or autoradiography in selected areas of the brain during induction and successive states of general anesthesia have yet to be conducted.

Both azido and isothiocyanato-substituted phenylalkyl analogues were synthesized and evaluated for displacement of [H-3]WIN 35 428 in rat caudate putamen tissue. All of the analogues showed moderate binding potencies at the DAT. The azido analogue, 16b, was radiolodinated and used to photolabel human DAT-transfected HEK 293 cell membranes. [I-125] 16b irreversibly labeled an similar to80 kDa band corresponding to the DAT detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. This radioligand provides a novel addition to the growing arsenal of structurally diverse irreversible ligands that are being used to identify binding domains on the DAT Characterizing points of attachment of these irreversible probes to the DAT protein will ultimately help elucidate the three-dimensional arrangement of the transmembrane domains, identify individual binding sites of the DAT inhibitors, and direct future drug design.

Cardiac sympathetic denervation and synucleinopathy in Alzheimer's disease with brain Lewy body disease	BRAIN COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						peripheral nervous system; Lewy body; Parkinson's disease; autopsy; dementia with Lewy bodies	ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; MYOCARDIAL SCINTIGRAPHY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CLINICAL DIAGNOSES; DEMENTIA; BODIES; DEGENERATION; NERVE; SENSITIVITY; CONSORTIUM	Comorbid Lewy body pathology is very common in Alzheimer's disease and may confound clinical trial design, yet there is no in vivo test to identify patients with this. Tissue (and/or radioligand imaging) studies have shown cardiac sympathetic denervation in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, but this has not been explored in Alzheimer's subjects with Lewy bodies not meeting dementia with Lewy bodies clinicopathological criteria. To determine if Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies subjects show sympathetic cardiac denervation, we analysed epicardial and myocardial tissue from autopsy-confirmed cases using tyrosine hydroxylase and neurofilament immunostaining. Comparison of tyrosine hydroxylase fibre density in 19 subjects with Alzheimer's disease/dementia with Lewy bodies, 20 Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies, 12 Alzheimer's disease subjects without Lewy body disease, 19 Parkinson's disease, 30 incidental Lewy body disease and 22 cognitively normal without Alzheimer's disease or Lewy body disease indicated a significant group difference (P< 0.01; Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance) and subsequent pair-wise Mann-Whitney U tests showed that Parkinson's disease (P< 0.05) and Alzheimer's disease/dementia with Lewy bodies (P< 0.01) subjects, but not Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies subjects, had significantly reduced tyrosine hydroxylase fibre density as compared with cognitively normal. Both Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease/dementia with Lewy bodies subjects also showed significant epicardial losses of neurofilament protein-immunoreactive nerve fibre densities within the fibre bundles as compared with cognitively normal subjects (P< 0.01) and both groups showed high pathologic alpha-synuclein densities (P< 0.0001). Cardiac alpha-synuclein densities correlated significantly with brain alpha-synuclein (P< 0.001), while cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase and neurofilament immunoreactive nerve fibre densities were negatively correlated with the densities of both brain and cardiac alpha-synuclein, as well as Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale scores ( P< 0.05). The clear separation of Alzheimer's disease/dementia with Lewy bodies subjects from Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal, based on cardiac tyrosine hydroxylase fibre density, is the first report of a statistically significant difference between these groups. Our data do not show significant sympathetic cardiac denervation in Alzheimer's disease with Lewy bodies, but strongly confirm that cardiac nuclear imaging with a noradrenergic radioligand is worthy of further study as a potential means to separate Alzheimer's disease from Alzheimer's disease/dementia with Lewy bodies during life.

Preclinical Evaluation of Benzazepine-Based PET Radioligands (<i>R</i>)- and (<i>S</i>)-<SUP>11</SUP>C-Me-NB1 Reveals Distinct Enantiomeric Binding Patterns and a Tightrope Walk Between GluN2B-and σ<sub>1</sub>-Receptor-Targeted PET Imaging	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET imaging; GluN2B; sigma(1)-receptor; receptor occupancy; neurodegeneration	NMDA RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; CP-101,606; ANTAGONIST; IFENPRODIL	The study aims to investigate the performance characteristics of the enantiomers of C-11-Me-NB1, a recently reported PET imaging probe that targets the GluN2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Methods: Reference compound Me-NB1 (inhibition constant for hGluN1/GluN2B, 5.4 nM) and the phenolic precursor were prepared via multistep synthesis. Following chiral resolution by high-performance liquid chromatography, enantiopure precursor compounds, (R)-NB1 and (S)-NB1, were labeled with C-11 and validated in rodents using in vitro/ex vivo autoradiography, PET experiments, and dose-response studies. To illustrate the translational relevance, (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 was validated in autoradiographic studies using postmortem human GluN2B-rich cortical and GluN2B-deficient cerebellar brain slices. To determine target engagement, receptor occupancy was assessed at different plasma concentrations of CP101,606, a GluN2B receptor antagonist. Results: The radiosynthesis of (R)- and (S)-11C-Me-NB1 was accomplished in 42% +/- 9% (decay-corrected) radiochemical yields. Molar activity ranged from 40 to 336 GBq/mu mol, and an excellent radiochemical purity of greater than 99% was achieved. Although (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 displayed heterogeneous accumulation with high selectivity for the GluN2B-rich forebrain, (S)-11C-Me-NB1 revealed a homogeneous distribution across all brain regions in rodent brain autoradiograms and predominantly exhibited sigma(1)-receptor binding. Similar to rodent brain, (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 showed in postmortem human brain tissues higher binding in the cortex than in the cerebellum. Coincubation of the GluN2B-antagonist CERC-301 (1 mu M) reduced cortical but not cerebellar binding, demonstrating the specificity of (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 binding to the human GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor. In vivo specificity of (R)-(CMe)-C-11- NB1 in the GluN2B-expressing cortex, striatum, thalamus, and hippocampus was demonstrated by PET imaging in rodents. Applying GluN2B-antagonist eliprodil, an evident dose-response behavior was observed with (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 but not with (S)-(CMe)-C-11-NB1. Our findings further underline the tightrope walk between GluN2B- and sigma(1)-receptor-targeted imaging, illustrated by the entirely different receptor binding behavior of the 2 radioligand enantiomers. Conclusion: (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 is a highly selective and specific PET radioligand for imaging the GluN2B subunit of the NMDA receptor. The entirely different receptor binding behavior of (R)-C-11-Me-NB1 and (S)-C-11-Me-NB1 raises awareness of a delicate balance that is underlying the selective targeting of either GluN2B-carrying NMDA or sigma(1)-receptors.

To overcome the low metabolic stability and simultaneously increase the binding affinity of known CB2R radioligands, a carborane moiety was used as a bioisostere. Here we report the synthesis and characterization of carboranebased 1,8-naphthyridinones and thiazoles as novel CB2R ligands. All tested compounds showed low nanomolar CB2R affinity, with (Z)- N-[3-(4-fluorobutyl)-4,5-dimethylthiazole-2(3H)-ylidene]-(1,7-di-carba-closo-dodecaboranyl)-carboxamide (LUZ5) exhibiting the highest affinity (0.8 nM). Compound [18F]LUZ5-d8 was obtained with an automated radiosynthesizer in high radiochemical yield and purity. In vivo evaluation revealed the improved metabolic stability of [18F]LUZ5-d8 compared to that of [18F]JHU94620. PET experiments in rats revealed high uptake in spleen and low uptake in brain. Thus, the introduction of a carborane moiety is an appropriate tool for modifying literature-known CB2R ligands and gaining access to a new class of high-affinity CB2R ligands, while the in vivo pharmacology still needs to be addressed.

Of these compounds, 13 exhibits potent binding affinity (IC50 = 7.6 +/- 0.9 nM), positive allosteric modulator (PAM) activity (EC50 = 51.2 nM), and excellent selectivity against other mGluR subtypes (>100-fold). [C-11]13 was synthesized via O-[C-11]methylation of its phenol precursor 25 with [C-11]methyl iodide. The achieved radiochemical yield was 20 +/- 2% (n = 10, decay-corrected) based on [C-11]CO2 with a radiochemical purity of >98% and molar activity of 98 +/- 30 GBq/mu mol EOS. Ex vivo biodistribution studies revealed reversible accumulation of [C-11]13 and hepatobiliary and urinary excretions. PET imaging studies in rats demonstrated that [C-11]13 accumulated in the mGluR2-rich brain regions. Pre-administration of mGluR2-selective PAM, 17 reduced the brain uptake of [C-11]13, indicating a selective binding. Therefore, [C-11]13 is a potential PET imaging ligand for mGluR2 in different central nervous system-related conditions.

In docking analysis with A(2)AR protein model, compound 7e found to be deeply buried into the cavity of receptor lined via making numerous interatomic contacts with His264, Tyr271, His278, Glu169, Ala63, Va184, Ile274, Met270, Phe169. Collectively, our study demonstrated 1,3,5-triazine-thiadiazole hybrid as a highly effective scaffold for the design of new A(2)A antagonists.

How exercise intensity and concomitant effective changes affect central opioidergic responses is unknown. We studied the effects of acute physical exercise on the cerebral mu-opioid receptors (MOR) of 22 healthy recreationally active males using positron emission tomography (PET) and the MOR-selective radioligand [C-11] carfentanil. MOR binding was measured in three conditions on separate days: after a 60-min aerobic moderate-intensity exercise session, after a high-intensity interval training (HIIT) session, and after rest. Mood was measured repeatedly throughout the experiment. HIIT significantly decreased MOR binding selectively in the frontolimbic regions involved in pain, reward, and emotional processing (thalamus, insula, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex). Decreased binding correlated with increased negative emotionality. Moderate-intensity exercise did not change MOR binding, although increased euphoria correlated with decreased receptor binding. These observations, consistent with endogenous opioid release, highlight the role of the mu-opioid system in mediating affective responses to high-intensity training as opposed to recreational moderate physical exercise.

Twelve new diaryl- or aryl/heteroaryl-substituted phenylalanine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated in vitro in radioligand binding assays at native rat ionotropic glutamate receptors. The most interesting compound in this series, (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-(1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-[1,1-biphenyl]-3-yl)propanoic acid 7e, showed the binding affinity of4.6m for native AMPA receptors and over fourfold lower affinity for kainic acid receptors. Furthermore, 7e was evaluated at recombinant homomeric rat GluA2 and GluA3 receptors. Recently reported X-ray structures 5CBR and 5CBS, representing two distinct antagonist binding modes, were used as templates for molecular docking of the synthesized series. Binding data supported with molecular modeling confirmed that aryl/heteroaryl-substituted phenylalanine analogues effectively bind to AMPA receptors with low micromolar affinity and high selectivity over native NMDA and kainate receptors. These properties make 7e a promising lead for the further development of new AMPA receptor ligands.

Thus, 5-HT2c receptors play important roles in cognitive function and are potent drug targets. Structural information is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of ligand-binding and receptor-activation of the 5-HT2c receptor. Lacking of an efficient expression system that produces sufficient amounts of active and homogenous receptors hinders progress in the functional and structural characterization of the 5-HT2c receptor. We present here a protocol which can be used easily to obtain milligram amount of purified rat 5-HT2c receptors. We established this protocol by protein engineering and optimization of expression and purification based on radioligand-binding assay. The purified and well-characterized rat 5-HT2c receptors are active, stable, homogenous, and ready for 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional crystallization experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The ketamine analogues methoxetamine ((RS)-2-(ethylamino)-2-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanone) and 3-MeO-PCE (N-ethyl-1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexanamine) and the 3- and 4-methoxy analogues of phencyclidine, (1-[1-(3-methoxyphenyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine and 1-[1-(4-methoxyphenyl) cyclohexyl] piperidine), were all high affinity ligands for the PCP-site on the glutamate NMDA receptor. In addition methoxetamine and PCP and its analogues displayed appreciable affinities for the serotonin transporter, whilst the PCP analogues exhibited high affinities for sigma receptors. Antagonism of the NMDA receptor is thought to be the key pharmacological feature underlying the actions of dissociative anaesthetics. The novel ketamine and PCP analogues had significant affinities for the NMDA receptor in radioligand binding assays, which may explain their psychotomimetic effects in human users. Additional actions on other targets could be important for delineating side-effects.

A primary overactivity of cerebellothalamic output pathways is the most conspicuous finding, as indicated by animal and human studies. It has been argued that this overactivity may be due to impaired central inhibition, and converging evidence points toward a potential role of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) dysfunction in tremor generation. Methods: Using C-11-flumazenil and PET, we calculated the distribution volume, an index of availability of benzodiazepine receptor sites of the GABAA complex, in a group of 8 patients with bilateral essential tremor, as compared with 11 healthy controls. Results: Significant increases in binding of C-11-flumazenil at the benzodiazepine receptor site of the GABA(A) receptor in the cerebellum, the ventrolateral thalamus, and the lateral premotor cortex were identified in the essential tremor group. Conclusion: Essential tremor is associated with reduced GABAergic function and increased availability of benzodiazepine receptor sites in brain regions implicated specifically in tremor genesis. This finding is thought to reflect overactivity of cerebellothalamic circuits and, hence, lends support to the "GABA hypothesis'' of essential tremor.

To address this need, we now present ML-9 (butyl-2-methyl-malonic acid; MW = 173), a rationally designed small-molecule detector of apoptosis, based on a novel alkyl-malonate motif. In proof-of-concept studies, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells by various triggers both in vitro and in vivo was associated with marked uptake of H-3-ML-9 administered in vivo, in correlation with the apoptotic hallmarks of DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and membrane phospholipid scrambling, and with correlative tumor regression. ML-9 uptake following chemotherapy was tumor-specific, with rapid clearance of the tracer from the blood and other non-target organs. Excess of non-labeled "cold" compound competitively blocked ML-9 tumor uptake, thus demonstrating the specificity of ML-9 binding. ML-9 may therefore serve as a platform for a novel class of small-molecule imaging agents for apoptosis, useful for assessment of tumor responsiveness to treatment.

These compounds carry Bodipy [558/568], Rhodamine Red-X [560/580], or Fluorolink Cy3 [550/570] fluorophores connected to pirenzepine through various linkers. All molecules reversibly bind with high affinity to M1 receptors (radioligand and energy transfer binding experiments) provided that the linker contains more than six atoms. The energy transfer efficiency exhibits modest variations among ligands, indicating that the distance separating EGFP from the fluorophores remains almost constant. This also supports the notion that the fluorophores may bind to the receptor protein. Kinetic analyses reveal that the dissociation of two Bodipy derivatives (10 or 12 atom long linkers) is sensitive to the presence of the allosteric modulator brucine, while that of all other molecules (15-24 atom long linkers) is not. The data favor the idea that these analogues might interact with both the acetylcholine and the brucine binding domains.

The fast-acting antidepressant drug mirtazapine, radiolabelled for PET, may be of value for assessing central adrenoceptors, provided that the radiation dosimetry of the radioligand is acceptable. To obtain that information, serial whole-body images were made for Lip to 70 min following intravenous injection of 326 and 185 MBq [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine (specific activities E.O.S. of 119 and 39 GBq/mumol, respectively) in a healthy volunteer. Ten source organs plus remaining body were considered in estimating absorbed radiation doses calculated using MIRD 3.1. The highest absorbed organ doses were found to the lungs (3.4 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq), adrenals (1.2 x 10(-2) mGy/ MBq), spleen (1.2 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq), and gallbladder wall (1.1 x 10(-2) mGy/MBq). The effective dose was estimated to be 6.8 x 10(-3) mSv/MBq, which is similar to that produced by several radioligands used routinely for neuroimaging. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thus, we examined the effects of mosapride citrate (mosapride) and cisapride, two 5-HT4-receptor agonists, on colonic motility in conscious guinea pigs implanted with force transducers. Mosapride and cisapride administered intragastrically at doses of 3 - 30 mg/kg significantly enhanced the colonic motility. The enhancing effect of mosapride was antagonized by atropine or GR113808, a 5-HT4-receptor antagonist, but not by methysergide, a 5-HT1- and 5-HT2-receptor antagonist; ondansetron, a 5-HT3-receptor antagonist; or CP-99994, a tachykinin NK1-receptor antagonist. In vitro receptor autoradiography showed that mosapride and cisapride inhibit the specific binding of [1151] -SB207710, a selective radioligand of 5-H(T)4 receptors, in the colon of guinea pigs. These results suggest that mosapride enhances colonic motility through the 5-HT4-receptor activation in guinea pigs and may be useful for treating constipation in patients with colonic motility dysfunction.

Methods beta (2)AR density and beta (2)AR mRNA level in peripheral lymphocytes, cAMP and cGMP levels in blood plasma were estimated by radioligand binding assay, radioimmunoassay and RT-PCR. Results (1) Maximum bound volume (Bmax) and equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of beta (2)AR of lymphocyte in asthma patients at remission stage were markedly higher than that in normal subjects, while cAMP levels in blood plasma showed no difference. Bmax of beta (2)AR and cAMP levels in asthma patients at acute exacerbation stage were significantly lower than that in normal subjects, and Kds between these two groups were not much different. (2) Expression of beta (2)ARmRNA in peripheral lymphocytes of asthmatics at remission stage was not significantly different compared with that in normals. Conclusions Amount and function of beta AR and beta (2)ARmRNA levels are related to asthmatic conditions. Changes of beta AR and beta (2)ARmRNA in asthma might rather be a pathological change accompanied by the course of the disease than a primary defect.

Autoantibodies to Perilipin-1 Define a Subset of Acquired Generalized Lipodystrophy	DIABETES			English	Article							CLINICAL-FEATURES; DERANGEMENTS	Acquired lipodystrophy is often characterized as an idiopathic subtype of lipodystrophy. Despite suspicion of an immune-mediated pathology, biomarkers such as autoantibodies are generally lacking. Here, we used an unbiased proteome-wide screening approach to identify autoantibodies to the adipocyte-specific lipid droplet protein perilipin 1 (PLIN1) in a murine model of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1 (APS1). We then tested for PLIN1 autoantibodies in human subjects with acquired lipodystrophy with two independent severe breaks in immune tolerance (including APS1) along with control subjects using a specific radioligand binding assay and indirect immunofluorescence on fat tissue. We identified autoantibodies to PLIN1 in these two cases, including the first reported case of APS1 with acquired lipodystrophy and a second patient who acquired lipodystrophy as an immune-related adverse event following cancer immunotherapy. Lastly, we also found PLIN1 autoantibodies to be specifically enriched in a subset of patients with acquired generalized lipodystrophy (17 of 46 [37%]), particularly those with panniculitis and other features of autoimmunity. These data lend additional support to new literature that suggests that PLIN1 autoantibodies represent a marker of acquired autoimmune lipodystrophies and further link them to a break in immune tolerance.

A major drawback of this compound is its rather fast metabolic degradation in vivo. Therefore two new xanthine derivatives, namely 8-cyclobutyl-1-cyclopropymethyl-3-(3-fluoropropyl)xanthine (CBCPM; 5) and 1-cyclopropylmethyl-3-(3-fluoropropyl)-8-(1-methylcyclobutyl)xanthine (CPMMCB; 6) were designed and synthesized as potential alternatives to CPFPX. In membrane binding studies both compounds showed nanomolar affinity for the A(1)AR. In vitro autoradiographic studies of [F-18]5 and [F-18]6, using rat brain slices, showed the expected accumulation in regions known to have a high adenosine A(1) receptor expression while exhibiting the necessary low unspecific binding. However, in vitro metabolite studies using human liver microsomes revealed a comparable metabolic degradation rate for both new xanthine derivatives and CPFPX. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

It was found that LP-211 was brain penetrant and underwent metabolic degradation to 1-(2-diphenyl)piperazine (RA-7). In vitro binding assays revealed that RA-7 possessed higher 5-HT7 receptor affinity than LP-211 and a better selectivity profile over a panel of 5-HT receptor subtypes. In vivo it was demonstrated that LP-211, and to a lesser degree RA-7, induced hypothermia in 5-HT7+/+ but not in 5-HT7-/- mice. Our results suggest that LP-211 can be used as a 5-HT7 receptor agonist in vivo. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

These chemically similar but biologically divergent target compounds served as molecular probes for radioligand displacement experiments, mutagenesis, and docking studies on homology models based on the recent crystal structure of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Specific interactions with the highly conserved amino acids ASP(3.32) and His(6.55) and less conserved residues at positions 2.61, 2,64, 3.28, and 3.29 were identified. Inclusion of a carefully modeled extracellular loop 2 displayed two nonconserved residues in EL2 that differently contribute to ligand binding. Obviously, subtype selectivity is caused by nonconserved but frequently mediated by conserved amino acids.

In order to better understand the in vivo opioid receptor selectivity of LY255582, we developed in vivo receptor occupancy assays in the rat for the opioid mu, kappa and delta receptors using the occupancy tracers naltrexone, GR103545 and naltriben respectively. Individual assays for each target were established and then a "triple tracer" assay was created where all three tracers were injected simultaneously, taking advantage of LC/MS/MS technology to selectively monitor brain tracer levels. This is the first report of a technique to concurrently measure receptor specific occupancy at three opioid receptors in the same animal. The opioid subtype selective antagonists cyprodime, JDTic and naltrindole were used to validate selectivity of the assay. Examination of LY255582 in dose-occupancy experiments demonstrated a relative order of potency of mu > kappa > delta, reproducing the previously reported order determined with in vitro binding.

These compounds are analogues of the 3-aryltropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester class of monoamine uptake inhibitors, where the 2 beta-carbomethoxy group has been replaced by an aryl group. The compounds were evaluated for inhibition of radioligand binding at the dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin transporters (DAT, NET, and 5-HTT, respectively). The results showed that the replacement of the 2 beta-carbomethoxy group in the 3-aryltropane class with a 2 beta-aryl group led to compounds possessing very similar monoamine transporter binding properties. However, the 2 beta,3 beta-diaryltropanes tended to be more potent at the DAT and more selective for the DAT relative to the NET and 5-HTT. One of the most interesting compounds was 3 beta-(4-methylphenyl)-2 beta-(4-methylphenyl)tropane (3d), which showed an IC50 of 1.23 nM at the DAT with 289- and 185-fold selectivity for the DAT relative to the NET and 5-HTT. The 2 alpha,3 alpha-diaryltropanes were much less potent at all three transporters than 2 beta,3 beta-diaryltropanes.

Starting with D-glucose, the tosyl- and mesyl-derivatives of 3,5-O-benzylidene-1,2-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-glucofuranose were prepared by known methods. Reaction of either of these precursors with F-18(-) resulted in the formation of 3,5-O-benzylidene-6-deoxy-6-[F-18]-fluoro-1,2-O-isopropylidene-alpha-D-glucofuranose in high yield. Subsequent hydrolysis resulted in the production of [F-18]6FDG. Under optimal conditions, [F-18]6FDG is produced 60-70min after end of bombardment (EOB) in 71 + 12% yield (decay corrected, based upon fluoride) with a radiochemical purity of >= 96%. Preliminary experiments have indicated that [F-18]6FDG may be a more representative in vivo tracer for the glucose transporter than 2FDG.

However, little is known about the physiological roles of the other melanocortins, beta- and gamma-MSH. Here, we investigated the effects of melanocortin peptides in an in vivo neuro inflammation model. Six hours following intracisternal (i.e.) administration of 10 mug lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to mice a five-fold increase in the nitric oxide (NO) level was seen in the animals' brains, when detected by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). All tested melanocortins, alpha-, beta-, gamma1- and gamma2-MSH (0.001-10 nmol/mouse i.e.), dose dependently reduced the LPS induced increases in brain NO, with an order of effectiveness: beta-MSH greater than or equal to gamma1-MSH = gamma2-MSH>alpha-MSH. Our results suggest specialized functions of beta- and gamma-MSH melanocortins in inflammatory signal modulation in the brain. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All fights research.

We report a method to assess noradrenaline reuptake blockade in vivo in man using [C-11]meta-hydroxyephedrine and the multiple organs' coincidences counter. Eight healthy volunteers had two scans, one with tracer alone and one after preloading with desipramine 50-75 mg p.o. In all subjects, there was an increased washout rate of the radioligand from the heart following preloading (t = 4.38; P < 0.003) as well as a decrease of the area under the [C-11]meta-hydroxyephedrine time activity curve (t = 7.4; P = 0.001). In one subject who had three doses of desipramine, the increase in washout rate was dose-dependent. In conclusion, [C-11]meta-hydroxyephedrine in the multiple organs coincidences counter gives a valid, low radiation method to assess noradrenergic reuptake blockade in the clinic.

We now report the isolation of exon 10, which is contained within yet another splice variant, MOR-1F, which is composed of exons 1, 2, 3, 10, 6, 7, 8 and 9, Exon 10 comprises 186 bp which predict a unique 58 amino acid sequence extending beyond exon 3, It has been mapped between exons 4 and 6 and has flanking consensus splice sequences. On Northern blot analysis, the MOR-1F mRNA is smaller than the other MOR-1 mRNAs, When expressed in CHO cells, MOR-1F binds the mu opioid radioligand [H-3]DAMGO with high affinity (K-D = 1.04 +/- 0.03 nM), Competition studies demonstrated the selectivity of the variant for mu opioid ligands, supporting its classification within the mu opioid receptor family.

Fluorine-18 holds several advantages over carbon-11, making it the radionuclide of choice for clinical purposes. In this respect, an F-18-labelled agonist 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) tracer is highly sought after. Herein, we report a 2-step, 1-pot labelling methodology of 2 tracer candidates. Both ligands display high in vitro affinities for the 5-HT2AR. The compounds were synthesised from easily accessible labelling precursors, and radiolabelled in acceptable radiochemical yields, sufficient for in vivo studies in domestic pigs. PET images partially conformed to the expected brain distribution of the 5-HT2AR; a notable exception however being significant uptake in the striatum and thalamus. Additionally, a within-scan displacement challenge with a 5-HT2AR antagonist was unsuccessful, indicating that the tracers cannot be considered optimal for neuroimaging of the 5-HT2AR.

Eleven PCA patients, 11 amnestic AD patients, and 15 age-matched controls underwent positron emission tomography with C-11-PBR28 to measure translocator protein 18 kDa. PCA patients showed greater C-11-PBR28 binding than controls in occipital, posterior parietal, and temporal regions. In contrast, amnestic AD patients showed greater C-11-PBR28 binding in inferior and medial temporal cortex. Increased C-11-PBR28 binding overlapped with reduced cortical volume for both PCA and amnestic AD patients, and with areas of reduced glucose metabolism in PCA patients. While both patient groups showed diffuse amyloid binding, PCA patients showed greater binding than amnestic AD patients in bilateral occipital cortex. These results suggest that microglial activation is closely associated with neurodegeneration across different subtypes of AD. (C) Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, quantitative interpretations of the PET signal with new generation TSPO PET radioligands are confounded by large interindividual variability in binding affinity. This presents as a trimodal distribution, reflecting high-affinity binders (HABs), low-affinity binder (LAB), and mixed-affinity binders (MABs). Here, we show that one polymorphism (rs6971) located in exon 4 of the TSPO gene, which results in a nonconservative amino-acid substitution from alanine to threonine (Ala147Thr) in the TSPO protein, predicts [F-18]-FEPPA total distribution volume in human brains. In addition, [F-18]-FEPPA exhibits clearly different features in the shape of the time activity curves between genetic groups. Testing for the rs6971 polymorphism may allow quantitative interpretation of TSPO PET studies with new generation of TSPO PET radioligands.

The aim of the present study was to validate a Logan reference tissue method as an analytical method for in vivo binding of [C-11](+)3-MPB to mAChR. Seven monkeys (Macaca mulatta) underwent [C-11](+)3-MPB PET scans with an arterial blood sampling. Logan plot with arterial input function (Logan arterial input method) was performed to determine the binding potential (BPND). The BPND was also determined by Logan plot with the cerebellum as the reference region (Logan reference tissue method). BPND values determined by Logan arterial input method and Logan reference tissue method showed a significant linear relationship. The present study suggests that the cerebellum is a suitable reference region for quantification of mAChR in the living brain with [C-11](+)3-MPB and PET. Synapse 65:548-551, 2011.

Advances in instrumentation in performing quantitative whole body autoradiography and nuclear imaging of small animals (SPEC, PET) using short-lived radiotracers (F-18, C-11) have led to additional options in DD. Micro-dosing involves administration of a tiny fraction (usually 1/100) of the intended therapy dose and containing micro to nano curie level of radiolabelled drug in human in the early phase of DD. These techniques have high sensitivity and provide quantitative Information to facilitate assessment of drug efficacy and regulatory approval and also lead to considerable cost saving through criteria-based selection or rejection of candidate molecules in DD. Radiotracers as radiopharmaceuticals are used to assess the efficacy of a potential drug, or therapy protocol, by quantitative nuclear imaging of the lesions and/or organ function in patients for early decision on the utility (or otherwise) or optimisation of the therapy.

A set of phosphatase-inert ''molecular rulers'' to probe for bivalent mannose 6-phosphate ligand-receptor interactions	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	9th Tetrahedron Symposium on Challenges in Organic and Bioorganic Chemistry	JUL 22-25, 2008	Berkeley, CA				FACTOR-II RECEPTOR; MULTIVALENT LIGANDS; BINDING-SITE; LOCALIZATION; DISPLACEMENT; RECOGNITION; RESIDUES; AFFINITY; CROSS	A set of bivalent mannose 6-phosphonate 'molecular rulers' has been synthesized to examine ligand binding to the M6P/IGF2R. The set is estimated to span a P-P distance range of 16-26 angstrom ( MMFF energy minimization on the hydrated phosphonates). Key synthetic transformations include sugar triflate displacement for phosphonate installation and Grubbs I cross-metathesis to achieve bivalency. Relative binding affinities were tested by radioligand displacement assays versus PMP-BSA ( pentamannosyl phosphate-bovine serum albumin). These compounds exhibit slightly higher binding affinities for the receptor (IC50's = 3.7-5 mu M) than the parent, monomeric mannose 6-phosphonate ligand and M6P itself (IC50 = 11.5 +/- 2.5 mu M). These results suggest that the use of an alpha-configured anomeric alkane tether is acceptable, as no significant thermodynamic penalty is apparently paid with this design. On the other hand, the modest gains in binding affinity observed suggest that this ligand set has not yet found true bivalent interaction with the M6P/IGF2R (i.e., simultaneous binding to two distinct M6P-binding pockets).

(Valerianaceae) is a psychoactive plant usually used in magical-therapeutic rituals in traditional practices of the Northern Peruvian Andes. Previous studies have been carried out on extracts of aerial parts in order to validate its traditional use. The results indicated that Valeriana adscendens exerts important effects on the central nervous system. Aim of the present study is to evaluate if the effects on the central nervous system of Valeriana adscendens extracts can be associated with interaction with some CNS receptors. In this work we examined affinity and selectivity of two Valeriana adscendens extracts (methanolic and aqueous) towards 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C serotononergic, D, and D-2 dopaminergic, alpha(1) and alpha(2) noradrenergic receptors by a preliminary binding screen. The results show weak affinity to 5-HT1A for the aqueous extract. Both extracts showed affinity for D, receptors, but only for the methanolic extract the IC50 value was determinable (30.14 mu g/ml). No affinity for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C serotononergic receptors, alpha(1) and alpha(2) noradrenergic receptors and D-2 receptors was recorded for the extracts. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The affinity of analogues was determined in a radioligand binding assay using cloned human MT(1) and MT(2) receptor subtypes expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Agonist and antagonist potency of all analogues was measured using the pigment aggregation response of a clonal line of Xenopus laevis melanophores. beta-Methylmelatonin ( 17a) and beta,beta-dimethylmelatonin ( 17b), though showing a slight decrease in binding at human receptors, show an increase in potency on Xenopus. N-Butanoyl 5-methoxy-1-methyl-beta,beta-trimethylenetryptamine ( 12c) is an antagonist at human MT1 receptors but an agonist at MT2, while N-butanoyl 5-methoxy-1-methyl-beta,beta-tetramethylenetryptamine ( 13c) is an antagonist at MT1 but had no action at MT2 and is one of the first examples of an MT1 selective antagonist.

One lead molecule of this series, called compound 1 (dimethyl 7-methyl-2,4-di-2-pyridyl-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-one-1,5-dicarboxylate) exhibited high affinity for [H-3]ethylketocyclazocine and [H-3]U-69,593 binding sites in guinea pig cerebellar membranes which known to be a good sources for kappa(1) receptors. It was shown by molecular modelling that heterocyclic bicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-9-ones fit very well with the structure of ketazocine, a prototypic kappa-selective benzomorphan compound; when compared to the arylacetamide structure of U-69,593, a specific kappa(1)-receptor agonist, a similar geometry was found with a slightly different distribution of the charges. It is postulated, that the essential structural skeleton involved in the opioid activity is ail aryl-propyl-amine element distributed along the N7-C6-C5-C4-aryl bonds.

STUDY DESIGN: Female rats were oophorectomized and divided into 2 groups; one group received streptozocin during the operation to induce diabetes, and the other served as a nondiabetic control group. Random blood glucose levels were measured. Half the rats in each group were killed on postoperative day 10, and half were killed on postoperative day 14. Direct radioligand binding assays were performed on tissue prepared from the hypothalamus, preoptic area, and cortex of each rat. Analysis of variance was used to evaluate intergroup differences in receptor concentration or equilibrium constant. RESULTS: We detected no significant difference in the mean receptor concentration or equilibrium constant between the groups with and without diabetes in the hypothalamus, the preoptic area, and the cortex on postoperative day 10 or 14. CONCLUSION: Diabetes-induced impairments in female rat reproduction do not involve alterations in alpha(2)-receptor density or affinity in the hypothalamus, preoptic area, or cortex.

EC50 values for AM and CGRP were 9.8 +/- 2.4 and 4.2 +/- 0.1 nmol/l, respectively. AM-mediated vasorelaxation was partially (3-fold) shifted by AM(22-52), the C-terminal AM fragment, but not by CGRP(8-37), a selective CGRP1 antagonist. Both AM(22-52) and CGRP(8-37) failed to inhibit CGRP-mediated vasorelaxation of mouse aorta rings. Binding of rat [I-125]AM to these membranes was specific. Both human AM and AM(22-52) displaced rat [I-125]AM binding in a concentration-dependent manner with IC50 values of 12.0 +/- 4 and 19.4 +/- 8 nmol/l, respectively. In contrast, both human CGRP and CGRP(8-37) were weak in displacing [I-125]AM binding. Very little specific binding was observed with [I-125]CGRP. In conclusion, the data presented here demonstrate that the mouse aorta displays AM receptors that mediate vasorelaxation. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger, AG, Basel.

Our aim was to perform image-based absorbed dose calculation for the new PSMA ligand Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 in support of its use for the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Methods Whole-body planar images and SPECT/CT images of the abdomen were acquired in five patients (mean age 68 years) for during two treatment cycles at approximately 1, 24, 48 and 72 h after administration of 3.6 GBq (range 3.4 to 3.9 GBq) Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617. Quantitative 3D SPECT OSEM reconstruction was performed with corrections for photon scatter, photon attenuation and detector blurring. A camera-specific calibration factor derived from phantom measurements was used for quantitation. Absorbed doses were calculated for various organs from the images using a combination of linear approximation, exponential fit, and target-specific S values, in accordance with the MIRD scheme. Absorbed doses to bone marrow were estimated from planar and SPECT images and with consideration of the blood sampling method according to the EANM guidelines. Results The average (+/- SD) absorbed doses per cycle were 2.2 +/- 0.6 Gy for the kidneys (0.6 Gy/GBq), 5.1 +/- 1.8 Gy for the salivary glands (1.4 Gy/GBq), 0.4 +/- 0.2 Gy for the liver (0.1 Gy/GBq), 0.4 +/- 0.1 Gy for the spleen (0.1 Gy/GBq), and 44 +/- 19 mGy for the bone marrow (0.012 Gy/GBq). The organ absorbed doses did not differ significantly between cycles. The critical absorbed dose reported for the kidneys (23 Gy) was not reached in any patient. At 24 h there was increased uptake in the colon with 50 - 70 % overlap to the kidneys on planar images. Absorbed doses for tumour lesions ranged between 1.2 and 47.5 Gy (13.1 Gy/GBq) per cycle. Conclusion The salivary glands and kidneys showed high, but not critical, absorbed doses after RLT with Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617. We suggest that Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 is suitable for radiotherapy, offering tumour-to-kidney ratios comparable to those with RLT agents currently available for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumours. Our dosimetry results suggest that Lu-177-DKFZ-PSMA-617 treatment with higher activities and more cycles is possible without the risk of damaging the kidneys.

The aims of this study were to estimate the radiation safety profile and relative risks of [F-18]SPA-RQ with 3 different methods of image analysis. Methods: Whole-body PET images were acquired in 7 healthy subjects after injection of 192 +/- 7 MBq (5.2 +/- 0.2 mCi) [F-18]SPA-RQ. Emission images were serially acquired at multiple time-points from 0 to 120 min and approximately 180-240 min after injection. Urine samples were collected after each imaging session and for 24 h after the last scan to measure excreted radioactivity. Horizontal tomographic images were compressed to varying degrees in the anteroposterior direction to create 3 datasets: thin-slice, bisected, and 2-dimensional (2D) planar images. Regions of interest were drawn around visually identifiable source organs to generate time-activity curves for each dataset. Residence times were determined from these curves, and doses to individual organs and the body as a whole were calculated using OLINDA/EXM 1.0. Results: The lungs, upper large intestine wall, small intestine, urinary bladder wall, kidneys, and thyroid had the highest radiation-absorbed doses. Biexponential fitting of mean bladder and urine activity showed that about 41% of injected activity was excreted via urine. Assuming a 2.4-h urine voiding interval, the calculated effective doses from thin-slice, bisected, and 2D planar images were 29.5, 29.3, and 32.3 mu Sv/MBq (109, 108, and 120 mrem/mCi), respectively. Conclusion: Insofar as effective dose is an accurate measure of radiation risk, all 3 methods of analysis provided quite similar estimates of risk to human subjects. The radiation dose was moderate and would potentially allow subjects to receive multiple PET scans in a single year. Individual organ exposures varied among the 3 methods, especially for structures asymmetrically located in an anterior or posterior position. Bisected and 2D planar images almost always provided higher organ dose estimates than thin-slice images. Thus, either the bisected or 2D planar method of analysis appears acceptable for quantifying human radiation burden, at least for radioligands with a relatively broad distribution in the body and not concentrated in a small number of radiation sensitive organs.

Peptide chain elongations were performed according to optimized standard protocols via solid-phase peptide synthesis. In vitro experiments were performed using PSMA(+) LNCaP cells. In vivo studies as well as mu SPECT/CT scans were conducted with male LNCaP tumor xenograft-bearing CB17-SCID mice.ResultsPSMA ligands with A) modifications within the central Zn2+-binding unit, B) proinhibitor motifs and C) substituents & bioisosteres of the P1-gamma-carboxylic acid were synthesized and evaluated. Modifications within the central Zn2+-binding unit of PSMA-10 (Glu-urea-Glu) provided three compounds. Thereof, only Lu-nat-carbamate I (Lu-nat-3) exhibited high affinity (IC50=7.1 +/- 0.7nM), but low tumor uptake (5.31 +/- 0.94% ID/g, 1h p.i. and 1.20 +/- 0.55% ID/g, 24h p.i.). All proinhibitor motif-based ligands (three in total) exhibited low binding affinities (>1 mu M), no notable internalization and very low tumor uptake (<0.50% ID/g). In addition, four compounds with P1 '-gamma-carboxylate substituents were developed and evaluated. Thereof, only tetrazole derivative Lu-nat-11 revealed high affinity (IC50=16.4 +/- 3.8nM), but also this inhibitor showed low tumor uptake (3.40 +/- 0.63% ID/g, 1h p.i. and 0.68 +/- 0.16% ID/g, 24h p.i.). Salivary gland uptake in mice remained at an equally low level for all compounds (between 0.02 +/- 0.00% ID/g and 0.09 +/- 0.03% ID/g), wherefore apparent tumor-to-submandibular gland and tumor-to-parotid gland ratios for the modified peptides were distinctly lower (factor 8-45) than for [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-10 at 24h p.i.Conclusions The investigated compounds could not compete with the in vivo characteristics of the EuE-based PSMA inhibitor [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-10. Although two derivatives (3 and 11) were found to exhibit high affinities towards LNCaP cells, tumor uptake at 24h p.i. was considerably low, while uptake in salivary glands remained unaffected. Optimization of the established animal model should be envisaged to enable a clear identification of PSMA-targeting radioligands with improved tumor-to-salivary gland ratios in future studies.

Aims were to develop a kinetic modeling-based approach to quantify (+)-[F-18]Flubatine and compare the data of healthy controls (HCs) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD); to investigate the partial volume effect (PVE) on regional (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding; and whether (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding and cognitive test data respective beta-amyloid radiotracer accumulation were correlated. \ Methods: We examined 11 HCs and 9 mild AD patients. All subjects underwent neuropsychological testing and [C-11]PiB PET/MRI examination. (+)-[F-18]Flubatine PET data were evaluated using full kinetic modeling and regional as well as voxel-based analyses. Results: With 270-min p.i., the unchanged parent compound amounted to 97 +/- 2%. Adequate fits of the time-activity curves were obtained with the 1 tissue compartment model (1TCM). (+)-[F-18]Flubatine distribution volume (binding) was significantly reduced in bilateral mesial temporal cortex in AD patients compared with HCs (right 10.6 +/- 1.1 vs 11.6 +/- 1.4,p = 0.049; left 11.0 +/- 1.1 vs 12.2 +/- 1.8,p = 0.046; one-sidedttests each). PVE correction increased not only (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding of approximately 15% but also standard deviation of 0.4-70%. Cognitive test data and (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding were significantly correlated in the left anterior cingulate, right posterior cingulate, and right parietal cortex (r > 0.5,p < 0.05 each). In AD patients, (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding and [C-11]PiB standardized uptake value ratios were negatively correlated in several regions; whereas in HCs, a positive correlation between cortical (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding and [C-11]PiB accumulation in the white matter was found. No adverse event related to (+)-[F-18]Flubatine occurred. Conclusion: (+)-[F-18]Flubatine is a safe and stable PET ligand. Full kinetic modeling can be realized by 1TCM without metabolite correction. (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding affinity was high enough to detect group differences. Of interest, correlation between white matter beta-amyloid PET uptake and (+)-[F-18]Flubatine binding indicated an association between white matter integrity and availability of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs. Overall, (+)-[F-18]Flubatine showed favorable characteristics and has therefore the potential to serve as alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR-targeting PET ligand in further clinical trials.

Equilibrium and kinetic protocols were applied and the competitive antagonist granisetron was included as a negative control. In competition studies, both granisetron and GYKI-46 903 displaced the radioligand with K-i values of 0.20 +/- 0.02 and 79.84 +/- 0.28 nM, respectively. The inhibition curve for GYKI-46 903 resulted in a Hill slope significantly greater than unity (1.37 +/- 0.11), whereas the slope for granisetron was 0.88 +/- 0.08, not different from unity. These results indicate non-competitive and competitive interactions, respectively. Scatchard analysis yielded a linear plot, suggesting a single population of binding sites with a K-d of 0.13 +/- 0.01 nM and a B-max of 13.15 +/- 0.34 fmol per mg of protein. Scatchard plots obtained in the absence and presence of granisetron (0.1-3 nM) or GYKI-46 903 (30-1000 nM) revealed a concentration-dependent increase in K-d values by either of these compounds. Granisetron left the B-max unchanged, but there was a significant increase in the B-max by GYKI-46 903, which could point to an atypical allosteric interaction. The Schild plot derived from the K-d shifts induced by granisetron was linear with a slope of 1.02, not different from unity. as expected from a competitive interaction. The Schild regression for GYKI-46 903 was linear with a slope of 1.20. deviating significantly from unity, which may also indicate an allosteric interaction. Both the association and dissociation curves of [H-3]granisetron were monoexponential. The dissociation rate constant (K-1) and the association rare constant (K+1) were 0.32 +/- 0.01 min(-1) and 1.15 min(-1) nM(-1), respectively. The dissociation driven by an excess concentration of ondansetron (1 muM) in the absence and presence of granisetron (0.1-3 nM) or GYKI-46 903 (30-10 000 nM) was not influenced by the compounds under study, as compared with the control, indicating the lack of an allosteric effect on the dissociation. Summing up, the binding profile of GYKI-46 903 may reflect a mixed type of action, including a negative allosteric interaction. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

However, previous studies demonstrated both heterogeneity of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) expression, as well as response to PSMA treatment among mCRPC patients. Thus, there is an unmet need for identifying predictive parametres prior or under PSMA-RLT treatment. We therefore aimed to correlate several clinical and molecular parameters with response to PSMA treatment in a cohort of mCRPC patients undergoing PSMA RLT followed by a detailed analysis of promising candidates. Methods: Nineteen patients, median age 68.8 years (range: 56.9 - 83.3) with mCRPC were included in this study. We performed baseline analysis of clinical parameters based on PSMA PET/CT, (metabolic tumor volume (MTV), total tumor volume (TTV)), serum PSA, ALP, LDH and gene expression analysis of circulating tumor cells (expression of AR full length (AR-FL), AR splice variant 7 (AR-V7), PSA and PSMA) as well as common markers for neuroendocrine differentiation (NED). Results: Patients presented with bone, lymph node, and visceral metastases (89%, 68%, and 21%, respectively). All patients were pretreated with docetaxel, either abiraterone or enzalutamide, or both. Biochemical response in terms of PSA decline >= 50 or >= 30% was observed in 42% and 63%, respectively. There were significant correlations between PSA and PSMA mRNA expression, as well as tumor volumes (both MTV and TTV), AR-FL and AR-V7 mRNA expression. However, there was no correlation with response to PSMA treatment. Furthermore, none of these parameters was significantly correlated with baseline serum PSA values. Common NED markers were shown to be specifically high expressed and revealed impact on OS independent from AR-V7 gene expression. Conclusion: We demonstrate that AR-FL and its splice variant AR-V7 might serve as prognostic biomarkers displaying high tumor burden in mCRPC patient prior to PSMA-RLT. Contrary, PSMA, which has been discussed as a biomarker for PSMA targeted treatment, does not display strong prognostic ability - at least on the mRNA level. Surprisingly, none of these parameters correlates to response to PSMA treatment. In contrast, commom NED markers such as SYP and ENO2 as well as FOXA1 expression level seem to predict OS, but not PFS, more reliably. We admit that a limitation of our study is the focus on mRNA expression of potential biomarkers only. Further investigations analyzing the potential role of protein expression of these markers are therefore warranted.

Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) combines a high-linear energy transfer (LET) emitter (Ac-225) with a prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) carrier, specifically binding tumor cells in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Although the antitumor activity of Ac-225-PSMA is well-documented, this treatment is nowadays only used as salvage therapy because the high incidence of xerostomia limits the therapeutic window. Thus, methods to reduce salivary toxicity and models able to describe xerostomia incidence are needed. We recently studied the efficacy of salivary gland protectors administered in combination with Lu-177-PSMA therapy. Starting from these data, we performed a predictive dosimetric evaluation of Ac-225-PSMA to assess the impact of salivary gland protectors in TAT. Ac-225-PSMA predictive dosimetry was performed in 13 patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA. Sequential whole-body planar images were acquired 0.5-1, 16-24, 36-48, and 120 h post-injection. Lu-177 time-activity curves were corrected for Ac-225 physical decay and assumed in equilibrium for all daughters. The OLINDA/EXM spherical model was used for dose estimation of the parotid and submandibular glands. The dose for each daughter was calculated and summed for the total dose estimation. The biologically effective dose formalism was extended to high-LET emitters. For the total biologically effective dose formalism extended to high-LET emitters, including the contribution of all daughter isotopes, the brachytherapy formalism for a mixture of radionuclides was implemented. Equivalent doses in 2 Gy/fraction (EQD2) were then calculated and compared with the normal tissue complication probability model derived from external beam radiotherapy for grade >= 2 xerostomia induction. Median predictive doses were 0.86 Bd(RBE5)/MBq for parotid glands and 1.05 Bd(RBE5)/MBq for submandibular glands, with a 53% reduction compared with previously published data. The results show that the radiobiological model implemented is conservative, as it overestimates the complication rate with respect to the clinical data. Our data shows the possibility of reducing salivary gland uptake in TAT with the coadministration of organ protectors, but these results should be confirmed for TAT with Ac-225-PSMA by carrying out prospective trials with defined toxicity endpoints and dosimetry procedures.

However, the correlation of PSMA expression and overall survival (OS) in patients treated with Lu-PSMA therapy is currently unclear; especially with regard to coexistence of high and low PSMA expressing metastases. To this end, this retrospective single arm study elucidates the correlation of PSMA expression and overall survival in patients treated with Lu-PSMA therapy. Additionally, PET based criteria to define low PSMA expression were explored. Methods: Eighty-five patients referred to Lu-PSMA therapy were included in the analysis. Pretherapeutic 68 Ga-PSMA-PET-CT scans were available for all patients. SUV max of the highest PSMA expressing metastasis (PSMA max), SUV max of the lowest PSMA expressing metastasis (PSMA min), and average SUV max of all metastases (PSMA average) amongst other PET parameters were measured for each patient. A log-rank cutoff-finder was used to determine low (lowPSMA average) and high (highPSMA average) average PSMA expression as well as low (lowPSMA min) and high (highPSMA min) minimal PSMA expression. Results: PSMA average was a significant prognosticator of overall survival in contrast to PSMA max (HR: 0.959; p = 0.047 vs. HR: 0.992; p = 0.231). Optimal log rank cut-offs were: PSMA average = 14.3; PSMA min = 10.2. Patients with low average PSMA expression (lowPSMA average) had significantly shorter survival compared to those with high average expression (highPSMA average) (5.3 vs. 15.1 months; p < 0.001; HR: 3.738, 95%CI = 1.953-7.154; p < 0.001). Patients with low PSMA expressing metastases (lowPSMA min) had shorter survival compared to those without a low PSMA expressing metastasis (highPSMA min) (p = 0.003; 7.9 months vs. 21.3; HR: 4.303, 95%CI = 1.521-12.178; p = 0.006). Patients that were classified as highPSMA average but with lowPSMA min had an intermediate overall survival (11.4 months; longer compared to lowPSMA average , 5.3 months, p = 0.002; but shorter compared to highPSMA min , 21.3 months, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Low average PSMA expression is a negative prognosticator of overall survival. Absence of low PSMA expressing metastases is associated with best overall survival and the maximum PSMA expression seems not suited to prognosticate overall survival. Low PSMA expression might therefore be a negative prognosticator for the outcome of patients treated with Lu-PSMA therapy. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the degree of low PSMA expression tolerable for Lu-PSMA therapy.

The Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide Receptor: A Novel Target for Neuroendocrine Tumor Imaging-First Preclinical Studies	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPr) neuroendocrine tumors (NETs); In-111; Ga-68; imaging	PEPTIDE-1 GLP-1; GLUCAGON; EXPRESSION; LIGAND; GIP; DEGRADATION; MECHANISMS; DOMAIN	A new family of peptide receptors, the incretin receptor family, overexpressed on many neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) is of great importance because it may enable the in vivo peptide-based receptor targeting of a category of NETs that does not express the somatostatin receptor. Impressive in vivo diagnostic data were published for glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor targeting radiopeptides. Recently, promising in vitro data have appeared for the second member of the incretin family, the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor. This prompted us to develop and evaluate a new class of radioligands with the potential to be used for the in vivo targeting of GIP receptor positive tumors. Methods: GIP(1-42) was modified C-terminally, and the truncated peptides [Lys(30)(aminohexanoic acid [Ahx]-DOTA)]GIP(1-30)NH2 (EG1), [Lys(16)(Ahx-DOTA)]GIP (1-30)NH2 (EG2), and [Nle(14), Lys(30)(Ahx-DOTA)]GIP(1-30)NH2 (EG4) were conjugated with Ahx-DOTA via the Lys(16) and Lys(30) side chains. Their inhibitory concentration of 50% (IC50) was determined using [(125)]-Tyr(10)]GIP(1-30) as radioligand and GIP(1-30) as control peptide. The DOTA conjugates were labeled with In-111 and Ga-68. In vitro evaluation included saturation and internalization studies using the pancreatic endocrine cell line INR1G9 transfected with the human GIP receptor (INR1G9-hGIPr). The in vivo evaluation consisted of biodistribution and PET imaging studies on nude mice bearing INR1G9-hGlPr tumors. Results: Binding studies (IC50 and saturation studies) showed high affinity toward GIP receptor for the GIP conjugates. Specific in vitro internalization was found, and almost the entire cell-associated activity was internalized (>90% of the cell-bound activity), supporting the agonist potency of the In-111-vectors. In-111-EG4 and Ga-68-EG4 were shown to specifically target INR1G9-hGIPr xengrafts, with tumor uptake of 10.4% +/- 2.2% and 17.0% +/- 4.4% injected activity/g, 1 h after injection, respectively. Kidneys showed. the highest uptake, which could be reduced by approximately 40%- 50% with a modified-fluid-gelatin plasma substitute or an inhibitor of the serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4. The PET images clearly visualized the tumor. Conclusion: The evaluation of EG4 as a proof-of-principle radioligand indicated the feasibility of imaging GIP receptor positive tumors. These results prompt us to continue the development of this family of radioligands for imaging of a broad spectrum of NETs.

In this study, cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp-D-Tyr-Lys [c(RGDyK)] was conjugated with 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (SCN-Bz-NOTA) and then labeled with Ga-68. The labeled RGD so produced was subjected to an in vitro binding assay and in vivo biodistribution and PET studies. Methods: A mixture of SCN-Bz-NOTA (660 nmol) and c(RGDyK) (600 nmol) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5) was allowed to react for 210 h at room temperature in the dark for thiourea bond formation. The conjugate obtained was purified by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The purified c(RGDyK)SCN-Bz-NOTA (NOTA-RGD) was then labeled with Ga-68 from a Ge-68/Ga-68 generator and purified by semipreparative HPLC. A competitive binding assay for c(RGDyK) and NOTA-RGD was performed with I-125-c(RGDyK) as a radioligand and alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-coated plates as a solid phase. Ga-68-NOTA-RGD (0.222 MBq/100 mu L) was injected, through a tail vein, into mice with hind limb ischemia and into mice bearing human colon cancer SNU-C4 xenografts. Biodistribution and imaging studies were performed at 1 and 2 h after injection. Results: The labeling of NOTA-RGD with Ga-68 was straightforward. The K-i values of c(RGDyK) and NOTA-RGD were 1.3 and 1.9 nM, respectively. In the biodistribution study, the mean +/- SD uptake of Ga-68-NOTA-RGD by ischemic muscles was 1.6 +/- 0.2 percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g); this uptake was significantly blocked by cold c(RGDyK) to 0.6 +/- 0.3 %ID/g (P < 0.01). Tumor uptake was 5.1 +/- 1.0 %ID/g, and the tumor-to-blood ratio was 10.3 +/- 4.8. Small-animal PET revealed rapid excretion through the urine and high levels of tumor and kidney uptake. Conclusion: Stable Ga-68-NOTA-RGD was obtained in a straightforward manner at a high yield and showed a high affinity for alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, specific uptake by angiogenic muscles, a high level of uptake by tumors, and rapid renal excretion. Ga-68-NOTA-RGD was found to be a promising radioligand for the imaging of angiogenesis.

Until now, Y4R binding studies have been predominantly performed in hypotonic sodium-free buffers using I-125-labeled derivatives of the endogenous YR agonists pancreatic polypeptide or peptide YY. A few tritium-labeled Y4R ligands have been reported; however, when used in buffers containing sodium at a physiological concentration, their Y4R affinities are insufficient. Based on the cyclic hexapeptide UR-AK86C, we developed a new tritium-labeled Y4R radioligand ([H-3]UR-JG102, [H-3]20). In sodium-free buffer, [H-3]20 exhibits a very low Y4R dissociation constant (K-d 0.012 nM). In sodium-containing buffer (137 mM Na+), the Y4R affinity is lower (K-d 0.11 nM) but still considerably higher compared to previously reported tritiated Y4R ligands. Therefore, [H-3]20 represents a useful tool compound for the determination of Y4R binding affinities under physiological-like conditions.

These compounds gave us the chance to evaluate whether their higher lipophilicity, reduced conformational freedom and chirality might improve the potency towards the A(3) AR. Racemic mixtures of 1-3 were resolved using chiral HPLC methods and the absolute configurations of the enantiomers were assigned by chiroptical spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. We measured the affinity for human A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) ARs of the racemic mixtures and the pure enantiomers of 1-3 by radioligand competition binding experiments. Cell-based assays of the most potent enantiomers confirmed their A(3) AR antagonist profiles. Our research led to the identification of (S)-1 with high potency (0.5 nM) and selectivity as an A(3) AR antagonist. Moreover we built a docking-model useful to design new pyrimidine derivatives.

Herein, the automated synthesis of [F-18]FECNT from its chlorinated precursor in commercially available SynChrom [F-18] R&D module has been developed. The synthesis unit was readily configured for the one-step synthesis from corresponding chlorinated precursor. The radiolabeling process involved a classical [F-18]fluoride nucleophilic substitution performed at 110 degrees C for 12min and finally HPLC and SPE purification. Crude [F-18]FECNT was obtained with a radiolabeling yield of 59 +/- 12% (n=5). The average uncorrected amount of [F-18]FECNT in the final formulated dose was 2.0 +/- 0.5 GBq (32 +/- 7% overall decay-corrected yields) obtained with radiochemical purity over 99% and specific activity of 55GBq/mu mol. The total duration of the procedure was 80-90min. An automated radiosynthesis of [F-18]FECNT with high radiochemical purity may provide a simple and robust method of radiopharmaceutical preparation for routine clinical applications.

In vitro competition binding assays showed that 1'-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl)-3H-spiro[2-benzofuran-1,4'-pipericline] (19) possessed high sigma(1) receptor affinity (K-i = 0.79 nM) and excellent sigma(1)/sigma(2) subtype selectivity (350-fold) as well as high sigma(1)/VAChT selectivity (799-fold). The radiolabeled compound [F-18]19 was synthesized by substitution of the tosylate precursor 24 with [F-18]fluoride, with an isolated radiochemical yield of 35-60%, a radiochemical purity of >99%, and a specific activity of 30-55 GBq/mu mol. Biodistribution studies in imprinting control region mice indicated that [F-18] 19 displayed excellent initial brain uptake and slow washout. Ex vivo autoradiography in Sprague Dawley rats demonstrated high accumulation of the radiotracer in brain areas known to express high levels of sigma(1) receptors. Micro positron emission tomography imaging and blocking studies confirmed the specific binding of [F-18] 19 to sigma(1) receptors in vivo.

G Protein-Coupled Receptor Heteromerization: A Role in Allosteric Modulation of Ligand Binding	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							MU-OPIOID RECEPTORS; HETERODIMERIZATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; ANTINOCICEPTION; DIMERIZATION; TOLERANCE; OPIATE	It is becoming increasingly recognized that G protein-coupled receptors physically interact. These interactions may provide a mechanism for allosteric modulation of receptor function. In this study, we examined this possibility by using an established model system of a receptor heteromer consisting of mu and delta opioid receptors. We examined the effect of a number of mu receptor ligands on the binding equilibrium and association and dissociation kinetics of a radiolabeled delta receptor agonist, [H-3]deltorphin II. We also examined the effect of delta receptor ligands on the binding equilibrium and association and dissociation kinetics of a radiolabeled mu receptor agonist, [H-3][D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin ([H-3]DAMGO). We show that mu receptor ligands are capable of allosterically enhancing delta receptor radioligand binding and vice versa. Thus, there is strong positive cooperativity between the two receptor units with remarkable consequences for ligand pharmacology. We find that the data can be simulated by adapting an allosteric receptor model previously developed for small molecules, suggesting that the ligand-occupied protomers function as allosteric modulators of the partner receptor's activity.

Promotion of Sleep by Suvorexant--A Novel Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonist	JOURNAL OF NEUROGENETICS			English	Article						hypocretin; insomnia; orexin; pharmacology; therapy; MK-4305	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; CANINE NARCOLEPSY; BEHAVIORAL STATE; KNOCKOUT MICE; NEURONS; RATS; WAKEFULNESS; HYPOCRETIN; EXPRESSION; INSOMNIA	Orexins/hypocretins are key neuropeptides responsible for regulating central arousal and reward circuits. Two receptors respond to orexin signaling, orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) with partially overlapping nervous system distributions. Genetic studies suggest orexin receptor antagonists could be therapeutic for insomnia and other disorders with disruptions of sleep and wake. Suvorexant (MK-4305) is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable antagonist of OX1R and OX2R currently under clinical investigation as a novel therapy for insomnia. Examination of Suvorexant in radioligand binding assays using tissue from transgenic rats expressing the human OX2R found nearly full receptor occupancy (> 90%) at plasma exposures of 1.1 mu mu M. Dosed orally Suvorexant significantly and dose-dependently reduced locomotor activity and promoted sleep in rats (10, 30, and 100 mg/kg), dogs (1 and 3 mg/kg), and rhesus monkeys (10 mg/kg). Consistent cross-species sleep/wake architecture changes produced by Suvorexant highlight a unique opportunity to develop dual orexin antagonists as a novel therapy for insomnia.</.

We have prepared two new derivatives of 3, 2-(2-(dimethylaminomethyl)phenoxy)-5-iodophenylamine (4) and 2-(2-(dimethylaminomethyl)benzyl)-5-iodophenylamine (5) (K-i for SERT = 0.37 and 48.6 nM, respectively). Both [I-125]4 and [I-125]5 displayed excellent brain uptakes in rats, and they showed a highest uptake in hypothalamus (between 60 and 240 min), a region populated with the highest density of SERT. The specific uptake of [I-125]4 in the hypothalamus resulted in a target to nontarget ratio ([hypothalamus-cerebellum]/cerebellum) of 4.3 at 2 h. Autoradiography of rat brain sections (ex vivo at 2 h) of [I-125]4 showed an excellent regional distribution pattern consistent with known SERT localization. These data suggest that [I-123]4 may be useful for imaging SERT binding sites in the brain by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

Methods: Whole-body scanning was performed on 6 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma up to 24 h after administration of Tc-99m-EC-C225. Alternate patients who had been randomized to receive C225 in a phase III trial received Tc-99m-EC-C225 before their 20-mg test dose or after their 400 mg/m(2) loading dose of unlabeled C225 (patients 1/3/5 and 2/4/6, respectively). Radiation dosimetry was assessed using the MIRD method. Results: The critical organ was the kidney, with an average radiation-absorbed dose for all 6 patients of 0.0274 mGy/MBq. The average total-body absorbed dose was 0.0022 mGy/MBq (0.243 cGy/1, 110 MBq).

Their affinity to imidazoline I-2 receptors and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors was determined by radioligand binding assay carried out on P-2 membrane preparations obtained from rat whole brains. 4-Chloro-2-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)indazole (3f, 4-Cl-indazim) showed a 3076-fold difference in affinity for the [H-3]2BFI-labeled imidazoline I-2 receptors relative to the [H-3]RX821001-labeled alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. This highly selective compound should prove to be useful tool in further understanding the functions of the imidazoline I-2 receptors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the expression of angiotensinogen mRNA and subcellular localization of renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin II were investigated in bovine adrenal medullary cells in primary culture. By light microscopy, expression of angiotensinogen mRNA, immunoreactive renin, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensin II were readily detectable only in the chromaffin cells. The density distribution of renin and angiotensin II in sucrose gradients suggested a concentration in chromaffin granules, a localization directly confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and sequencing confirmed the expression of angiotensinogen in bovine chromaffin cells and the adrenal medulla. In addition, in vitro autoradiography indicated that both angiotensin-converting enzyme and angiotensin type 1 receptors were present in the adrenal medulla. These results provide the first direct evidence that chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla are not only the target for angiotensin but should also be considered as potential local angiotensin-generating and -storing cells.

In this study, GHRH-receptor (GHRH-R) binding and mRNA in the pituitary of adult male dw/dw and age-matched normal Lewis rats was measured by radioligand binding assay and real-time PCR. Only one of nine pools of dw/dw pituitary membranes revealed detectable binding of [His(1), I-125-Tyr(10), Nle(27)]hGHRH(1-32) amide (B-max; 4.3 fmol/mg protein). In contrast, GHRH-R binding was 22.4 +/- 2.60 fmol/mg protein in normal Lewis rats. mRNA for GHRH-R was detectable in all dw/dw rat pituitaries examined, averaging 21% that of Lewis rats. Low expression of GHRH-R reflects reduced GHRH-R mRNA as well as a possible reduction in translation of the receptor protein. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The receptor subtype has been proposed as a target for novel antipsychotic drugs, however no selective positron emission tomography (PET) ligand is to date available to study the receptor distribution in vivo. 1-(2-Methoxyphenyl)-4-{4-[4-(6-imidazo[2,1-b]-thiazolyl)phenoxy]butyl}piperazine (RGH-1756) is a new methoxy-phenylpiperazine derivative that possesses high affinity (K-i: 0.119 nM) and good selectivity for the human dopamine D-3 receptor. In an attempt to develop a PET radioligand for the visualisation of the dopamine D-3 receptor in human brain we synthesised carbon-11-labelled RGH-1756. The radiolabelling was performed by reaction of the corresponding desmethyl precursor 1-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-4-{4-[4-(6-imidazo[2,1-b]-thiazolyl)phenoxy]butyl}piperazine (04512626) with [C-11]methyl triflate in acetone and aqueous NaOH. The HPLC-determined incorporation yield was >90%. The total synthesis time was 35 min and the specific radioactivity at end of synthesis ranged from 66 to 132 GBq/mu mol.

An isotopologue of our first-generation lead, [H-3]PF-367, demonstrates selective and specific target engagement in vitro, irrespective of the activation state. We discovered substantial ubiquitous GSK-3-specific radioligand binding in Tg2576 Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting application for these compounds in AD diagnosis and identified [C-11]OCM-44 as our lead GSK-3 radiotracer, with optimized brain uptake by PET imaging in nonhuman primates. GSK-3 beta-isozyme selectivity was assessed to reveal OCM-51, the most potent (IC50 = 0.030 nM) and selective (>10-fold GSK-3 beta/GSK-3 alpha) GSK-3 beta inhibitor known to date. Inhibition of CRMP2(T514) and tau phosphorylation, as well as favorable therapeutic window against WNT/beta-catenin signaling activation, was observed in cells.

Among them, 6-methyl-N46-[(2-methyl-3-pyridinypoxy]-3-pyridinyl]1H-indole-3-carboxamide (8) exhibits the highest 5-HT2C binding affinity (K-j = 1.3 nM) and high selectivity over 5-HT2A (similar to 1000 times) and 5-HT2B (similar to 440 times). [C-11]8 was synthesized by palladium-catalyzed coupling reaction between pinacolboranate 16 and [C-11]CH3I with an average radio-chemical yield of 27 +/- 4% (n = 8, decay-corrected from end of [C-11] CH3I synthesis). MicroPET imaging studies in rhesus monkeys showed regional uptake of [C-11]8 in the choroid plexus, whereas the bindings in all other brain regions were low. The specific binding in the choroid plexus was confirmed by administration of a blocking dose of 0.1 mg/kg of the 5-HT2C antagonist SB-242084.

Enhancing Neurosteroid Synthesis - Relationship to the Pharmacology of Translocator Protein (18 kDa) (TSPO) Ligands and Benzodiazepines	PHARMACOPSYCHIATRY			English	Article						TSPO ligands; benzodiazepines; pregnenolone; neurosteroids; anxiolytic	TARGET; MODULATION; ETIFOXINE; RECEPTOR	Introduction: The treatment of anxiety disorders is still a challenge; novel pharmacological approaches that combine rapid anxiolytic efficacy with fewer side effects are needed. A promising target for such compounds is the mitochondrial translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO). TSPO plays an important role for the synthesis of neurosteroids, known to modulate GABA(A) receptors, thereby exerting anxiolytic effects. Methods: We investigated the pharmacological profile of 2 well established TSPO ligands (XBD173 and etifoxine) compared to the benzodiazepine diazepam with regard to TSPO binding affinity, TSPO expression and neurosteroidogenesis. Results: In BV-2 microglia and C6 glioma cells all compounds significantly enhanced TSPO protein expression. Radioligand binding assays revealed the highest binding affinity to TSPO for XBD173, followed by diazepam and etifoxine. Pregnenolone synthesis was most potently enhanced by etifoxine. Discussion: Etifoxine turned out to be the most potent enhancer of neurosteroidogenesis, although its binding affinity to TSPO was lowest. These results indicate that the efficacy of TSPO ligands to stimulate neurosteroid synthesis, thereby leading to anxiolytic effects cannot be concluded from their binding affinity to TSPO.

The key steps of the synthesis comprise bromine/lithium exchange at regioisomeric bromopyridinecarbaldehyde acetals 7a-d, subsequent addition to 1-benzylpiperidin-4-one and cyclization. The regioisomeric acetals 7a-d were obtained either by o-metalation of bromopyridines 5b and 5c or by oxidation of bromopicolines 3a and 3d. In radioligand binding studies the regioisomeric furopyridines 2a-d showed 7- to 12-fold lower sigma(1) affinity than the benzofuran analog 1. The reduced sigma(1) affinity of the furopyridines 2a-d is explained with the reduced electron density of the pyridine ring. Since the four regioisomeric furopyridines show almost the same sigma(1) affinity (K-i = 4.9-10 nM), a directed interaction of the pyridine N-atom with the receptor protein can be excluded.

The synthesis of multiple follow-up solid- and solution-phase libraries facilitated the optimization of the original micromolar hit into a single-digit nanomolar BACE-1 inhibitor in both radioligand binding and cell-based functional assay formats. The X-ray structure of representative inhibitors bound to BACE-1 revealed a number of key ligand:protein interactions, including a hydrogen bond between the side chain amide of flap residue Gln73 and the acyl guanidine carbonyl group, and a cation-pi interaction between Arg235 and the isothiazole 4-methoxyphenyl substituent. Following subcutaneous administration in rats, an acyl guanidine inhibitor with single-digit nanomolar activity in cells afforded good plasma exposures and a dose-dependent reduction in plasma A beta levels, but poor brain exposure was observed (likely due to Pgp-mediated efflux), and significant reductions in brain A beta levels were not obtained.

Interaction of holothurian triterpene glycoside with biomembranes of mouse immune cells	INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Holothurians; Triterpene glycosides; Biomembranes; Immune cells	SEA-CUCUMBER; INTRACELLULAR CA2+; PANCREATIC-CANCER; OSCILLATIONS; COMPOUND; INFLUX	The in vitro interactions between triterpene glycoside, cucumarioside A(2)-2, isolated from the Far-Eastern holothurian Cucumaria japonica, and mouse splenocyte and peritoneal macrophage biomembranes were studied. Multiple experimental approaches were employed, including determination of biomembrane microviscosity, membrane potential and Ca2+ signaling, and radioligand binding assays. Cucumarioside A(2)-2 exhibited strong cytotoxic effect in the micromolar range of concentrations and showed pronounced immunomodulatory activity in the nanomolar concentration range. It was established that the cucumarioside A(2)-2 effectively interacted with immune cells and increased the cellular biomembrane microviscosity. This interaction led to a dose-dependent reversible shift in cellular membrane potential and temporary biomembrane depolarization; and an increase in [Ca2+](i) in the cytoplasm. It is suggested that there are at least two binding sites for [H-3]-cucumarioside A(2)-2 on cellular membranes corresponding to different biomembrane components: a low affinity site match to membrane cholesterol that is responsible for the cytotoxic properties, and a high affinity site corresponding to a hypothetical receptor that is responsible for immunostimulation.

This study investigated the role of beta-arrestin2 in cannabinoid behavioral effects using beta-arrestin2-/- mice and their wild-type counterparts. A variety of cannabinoid ligands from different chemical classes that exhibit a variety of efficacies for activation of CB(1) receptors were investigated, including Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, CP55940, methanandamide, JWH-073, and 0-1812. Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol produced both greater antinociception and greater decreases in body temperature in beta-arrestin2 -/- compared with beta-arrestin2 +/+ mice. No significant differences were, however, present in either assay for the other CB, agonists. Antagonist radioligand binding indicated no difference in the density of cannabinoid CB, receptors in the cerebellum, cortex, or hippocampus of beta-arrestin2 +/+ and -/- mice. These data demonstrate that beta-arrestin2 may regulate cannabinoid CB, receptor sensitivity in an agonist-specific manner.

The presence of PBR at the perinuclear/nuclear subcellular level has been demonstrated in aggressive breast cancer cell lines and human glioma cells where it seems to be involved in cell proliferation. In our study we investigated the presence of perinuclear/nuclear PBR in different hepatic tumor cell lines with regard to binding to [H-3] PK 11195 and protein analysis. The results obtained by saturation binding experiments and scatchard analysis of perinuclear/nuclear PBR density in parallel with the results on the growth curves of the cell lines tested, indicate that the perinuclear/nuclear PBR density correlates inversely with cell doubling time. Moreover, the cell line with high perinuclear/nuclear PBR proliferated in response to PBR ligand, whereas that with low perinuclear/nuclear PBR did not. Our results reinforce the idea that the subcellular localisation of PBR defines its function and that this receptor could be a possible target for new strategies against cancer.

Dinotefuran was less active than imidacloprid and clothianidin by a factor of 10 in molar concentrations. Their binding activities to the fly-head membrane preparation were measured by using [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin ([I-125]alpha-BGTX) and [H-3]imidacloprid ([H-3]IMI) as radioligands. The activity of some selected compounds measured with [H-3]IMI was 10(4)-fold higher than that measured with [I-125]alpha-BGTX. With [H-3]IMI as a radioligand, dinotefuran was 13-fold less active than imidacloprid. The inhibitory effect of dinotefuran on the binding of [H-3]IMI to the membrane preparation was in a competitive manner. Quantitative analysis of the insecticidal activity of the test compounds with the binding activity measured with [H-3]IMI showed that the higher the binding activity, the higher was the insecticidal activity.

[H-3]Ang II binding to the membrane fractions exhibited both high (K-d = 0.08 nM, B-max = 2.19 fmol/mg protein) and low (K-d = 4.19 nM, B-max = 13.7 fmol/mg protein) affinity. Ang II, Ang III and saralasin completely displaced the [H-3]Ang II binding, whereas CV-11974, an AT(1), receptor antagonist and PD123319, an AT(2) receptor antagonist maximally displaced up to approximately 87 and 13% of the total binding, respectively: [H-3]DuP753 binding to the membrane fractions exhibited a single population of binding site with a K-d of 4.22 nM and B-max of 3,77 pmol/mg protein. Ang II, Ang III and CV-11974 completely displaced the [H-3]DuP753 binding with slope factors near unity., but PD123319 did not. These findings suggest that rat submandibular gland membranes contain predominantly the AT(1), receptor subtype.

Nicotine has been widely used as a template for the synthesis of ligands that prefer alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs subtypes. The most important therapeutic use for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs is as replacement therapy for smoking cessation and withdrawal and the most successful therapeutic ligands are partial agonists. In this case, we use the N-methylpyrrolidine moiety of nicotine to design and synthesize new alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic derivatives, coupling the pyrrolidine moiety to an aromatic group by introducing an ether-bonded functionality. Meta-substituted phenolic derivatives were used for these goals. Radioligand binding assays were performed on clonal cell lines of h alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR and two electrode voltage-clamp experiments were used for functional assays. Molecular docking was performed in the open state of the nAChR in order to rationalize the agonist activity shown by our compounds.

SNYDER	Advances in Pharmacology		English	Article; Book Chapter							RADIORECEPTOR ASSAY; RESERPINE; MECHANISM	Although Solomon Snyder authored hundreds of research reports and several books covering a broad range of topics in the neurosciences, he is best known by many as the person who developed neurotransmitter receptor radioligand binding assays. By demonstrating the utility of this approach for studying transmitter receptors in brain, Dr. Snyder provided the scientific community with a powerful new tool for identifying and characterizing these sites, for defining their relationship to neurological and psychiatric disorders, and their involvement in mediating the actions of psychotherapeutics. Although it was hoped the receptor binding technique could also be used as a primary screen to speed and simplify the identification of novel drug candidates, experience has taught that ligand binding is most useful for drug discovery when it is used in conjunction with functional, phenotypic assays. The incorporation of ligand binding assays into the drug discovery process played a significant role in altering the search for new therapeutics from solely an empirical undertaking to a mechanistic and hypothesis-driven enterprise. This illustrates the impact of Dr. Snyder's work, not only on neuroscience research but on the discovery, development, and characterization of drugs for treating a variety of medical conditions.

Presently, a large series of 223 5-HT6 ligands were studied using a combinational method by 3D-QSAR, molecular docking and molecular dynamics calculations for further improvement of potency. The optimal 3D models exhibit satisfying statistical results with r(ncv)(2), q(2) values of 0.85 and 0.50 for CoMFA, 0.81 and 0.53 for CoMSIA, respectively. Their predictive powers were validated by external test set, showing r(pred)(2) of 0.71 and 0.76. The contour maps also provide a visual representation of contributions of steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond fields as well as the prospective binding models. In addition, the agreement between 3D-QSAR, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation proves the rationality of the developed models. These results, we hope, may be helpful in designing novel and potential 5-HT6 ligands.

The specific CT binding component in the plasma membrane fraction of the hypothalamus containing the preoptic area (HPOA) possessed properties of a receptor: binding specificity to CT, saturable binding, high affinity, and limited capacity. As for the median eminence area, no specific binding component was found in the present study. Therefore, the binding component for CT in the plasma membrane fraction of HPOA is likely to be a receptor for CT. In laying hens, the binding affinity of CT receptor increased at 30 min before oviposition and the binding capacity was decreased at 30 min before oviposition but not changed in nonlaying hens during a 24-h period. These results suggest that the action of CT on the hen HPOA may increase 30 min before oviposition.

In this study, we tested the selectivity by scanning seven healthy human research volunteers with [ 11C] NNC 112 before and after 2mg of the antipsychotic drug risperidone, a dose that putatively blocks all 5HT(2A) receptors with negligible effect on D1 receptors. We found that specific binding in cortical regions was reduced by 20% to 30%, whereas the striatum showed no change. Based on the known relative densities of these receptors in humans, our results suggest 5- to 10-fold selectivity of [ 11C] NNC 112 for D1 versus 5-HT2A as opposed to 100-fold selectivity. These results suggest caution in interpreting data from studies using this tracer to measure cortical D1 receptors as well as the need for more selective radioligands to assess cortical D1 receptors.

In schizophrenia, endocannabinoids and their receptors are involved in the pathology of the disease. Previous studies reported an increased radioligand binding to cannabinoid receptors 1 (CB1) in schizophrenia, both in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We analyzed the expression of the CB1 receptors in the ACC at the protein level using immunohistochemistry. In a quantitative postmortem study, 60 patients suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression and controls were included. Numerical densities of neurons and glial cells immunopositive for CB1 receptors were evaluated. No evidence of an increased or decreased density of CB1 receptor immunopositive cells in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder was found. In major depression, CB1 receptor immunopositive glial cells in the grey matter were decreased. Furthermore, our data show that different medications have an impact on the expression of CB1 receptors in the ACC.

Competitive radioligand binding assays were used to determine the effect of several mutants on nonpeptide binding. Distinct interactions were observed in two separate regions: the N-terminal end of TM7 and the C-terminal end of TM6. The effects of mutants at D302((7.32)) and H306((7.36)) suggest that these residues are part of a hydrogen-bond network important for anchoring the nonpeptides. Structure-activity relationships indicated urea substituents on the 6-(4-aminophenyl) group with a trans conformational preference bind with high affinity and are sensitive to D302((7.32)) mutations. Another interaction area was found between the N-benzyl-N-methylamino substituent and L300((6.68)) and Y290((6.58)). These interaction sites facilitated the derivation of a model in which a representative member of the series was docked into GnRH-R. The model is consistent with known SAR and illuminates inconsistencies with previous hypotheses regarding how this series interacts with the receptor.

Individuals display significant differences in their levels of expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT; SLC6A3). These differences in DAT are strong candidates to contribute to individual differences in motor, mnemonic and reward functions. To identify "cis"-acting genetic mechanisms for these individual differences, we have sought variants in 5' aspects of the human DAT gene and identified the haplotypes that these variants define. 2. We report (i) significant relationships between 5' DAT haplotypes and human individual differences in ventral striatal DAT expression assessed it? vivo using [C-11] cocaine PET and (ii) apparent confirmation of these results in studies of DAT expression in postmortem striatum Using [H-3] carboxyflurotropane binding. 3. These observations support the idea that cis-acting variation in 5' aspects of the human DAT/SLC6A3 locus contributes to individual differences in levels of DAT expression in vivo. 5' DAT variation is thus a good candidate to contribute to individual differences in a number of human phenotypes.

Central benzodiazepine receptor (CBR) affinities were also evaluated in rat cortices using [H-3]flumazenil to determine their selectivity for PBBS over CBR. The tested compounds had PBBS binding affinities (IC50) ranging from 7.86 to 618 nM, with all compounds showing high selectivity over the CBR (CBR IC50 > 5000 nM). Among the 12 compounds tested, those with a diethylamide group were the most potent. The highest affinity iodinated PBBS ligand, N,N-diethyl-[5-chloro-2-(4-iodophenyl)indol-3-yl]glyoxylamide (4c), was radiolabelled with iodine-123. This high affinity and selective radioligand may be useful for imaging neurodegencration, inflammation and tumours using single photon emission computed tomography. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Epidepride was radioiodinated using different oxidizing agents such as chloramine-T, iodogen, iodogen glass frit and hydrogen peroxide. Chloramine-T is a powerful oxidizing agent compared to both iodogen and hydrogen peroxide so that the side products, especially the chlorinated epidepride, decreases the radiochemical yield. This chlorinated epidepride is minimized in the case of iodogen and iodogen glass frit and are not observed in case of the non-chlorinated oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. TLC and HPLC were used to analyze the reaction components and to estimate both the radiochemical yield and purity. The reaction parameters such as reaction time, pH, epidepride and oxidizing agent concentrations and the stabilty of the final product were studied to optimize the radiochemical yield and purity. The optimized radiochemical yield was about 90% and the radiochemical purity of the final product was 99.9%.

A second strategy involves transduction of the sodium iodide symporter (NIS) and free radionuclide therapy. Using the first strategy, induction of high levels of human somatostatin receptor subtype 2 expression and selective tumor uptake, imaging, or growth inhibition with radiolabeled somatostatin analogs has been achieved in human tumor xenograft models. Therapy studies have been performed on several tumor xenograft models with various radionuclides using the NIS radiotargeted gene therapy approach. The use of gene transfer technology to induce expression of high-affinity membrane receptors or transporters can enhance the specificity and extent of radioligand or radionuclide localization in tumors, and the use of radionuclides with appropriate emissions can deliver radiation-absorbed cytotoxic doses across several cell diameters to compensate for limited transduction efficiency. Clinical studies are needed to determine the most promising of these new therapeutic approaches.

This characteristic makes sigma-1 receptors attractive candidates for the development of new drugs. Hypidone hydrochloride (YL-0919), a novel structured antidepressant candidate developed in our laboratory, possess a selective sigma-1 receptor agonist profile, as evidenced by molecular docking, radioligand receptor binding assays, and receptor functional experiments. In vivo studies have revealed that YL-0919 elicits a fast-onset antidepressant activity (within one week) that can be attenuated with pre-treatment of the selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist, BD-1047. Taken together, the findings of the current study suggest that YL-0919 activates the sigma-1 receptor to partially mediate the rapid onset antidepressant effects of YL-0919. Thus, YL-0919 is a promising candidate as a fast-onset antidepressant that targets the sigma-1 receptor.

A limited number of A(2A)R crystal structures show the receptor interacting with cholesterol, as such molecular simulations are often used to predict cholesterol interaction sites. Methods: Here, we use experimental methods to determine whether a specific interaction between amino acid side chains in the cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) of full length, wild-type human A(2A)R, and cholesterol modulates activity of the receptor by testing the effects of mutational changes on functional consequences, including ligand binding, G protein coupling, and downstream activation of cyclic AMP. Results and conclusions: Our data, taken with previously published studies, support a model of receptor state-dependent binding between cholesterol and the CCM, whereby cholesterol facilitates both G protein coupling and downstream signaling of A(2A)R.

SPECT based radioligands offer a cost effective understanding to the molecular changes which are used in the diagnoses of various neurological disorders. A Homobivalent approach was used to synthesize 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine based ligand by using click chemistry to incorporate two moieties of MPP via a linker (serinol) for SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computerised Tomography) evaluation. Molecular docking studies show better affinity for radiolabeled DO3 A-serinol-bis-MPP complex. The radiolabeling efficiency of conjugate was optimized and evaluated for stability by various parameters and was found to be 99 %. The complex shows appreciable brain uptake in rabbit. Ex Vivo pharmacology indicated approximately 50 % of the total brain uptake in the hippocampus region which showed the selective preference of the ligand for serotonin receptor. This study could be considered as a novel, informative and preclinical finding for using the synthesised Tc-99m-DO3 A-serinol-bis-MPP ligand to target serotonin receptor by SPECT imaging.

We present a patient with a novel clinical syndrome that we suggest results from a deficiency of the muscarinic M3 receptor. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive workup of autonomic function. The patient's disorder was compared to the phenotypic features of male M3 knockout mice. M3 protein quantity was assessed by Western blot and radioligand binding in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Tests for autoantibodies and genetic abnormalities were performed. Results: The disease pattern was characterized by disturbances in micturition, pupil constriction, body weight, and sudomotor function, with normal accommodation, gastrointestinal motility, salivation, and lacrimation, similar to features of male M3 knockout mice. M3 protein quantity was reduced. Genetic tests were unrevealing, but unspecific antinuclear antibodies were present. Conclusions: The presented clinical syndrome suggests a deficiency of the muscarinic M3 receptor. These results and future evaluation of patients with autonomic deficits may provide insights into the site and functional role of the muscarinic M3 receptor in humans.

A screening of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor affinity revealed that 3-(phenylsulfonyl) thieno[2,3-e][1,2,3] triazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidines are highly selective 5-HT6 receptor ligands.

This compound, named EC0225, represents the "first in class" multidrug, folate receptor (FR)-targeted agent to be disclosed. It was constructed with a single folate molecule, extended by a hydrophilic peptide-based spacer, which was in turn attached to mitomycin and Vinca alkaloid units via two separate disulfide-containing linkers. EC0225 produced potent, dose-responsive activity in vitro, and curative activity was observed against FIR-positive syngeneic and xenograft tumors following the administration of well-tolerated dosing regimens. Multiple complete responses and cures were also noted when EC0225 was used to treat mice initially bearing tumors as large as 750 mm(3) in volume. Overall, EC0225's impressive preclinical activity allowed for its selection as a development candidate and for the start of Phase 1 clinical trials, which began in March of 2007, for the treatment of advanced malignancies.

In the present model, cholesteryl (4-vinyl)phenyl carbonate was used as a template monomer. The imprinted microspheres were prepared using ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EDMA) and divinylbenzene (DVB) as crosslinker. The base-labile carbonate ester bond was easily hydrolyzed to leave imprinted cavities in the resulting polymers. Radioligand binding analysis, elemental analysis, and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the imprinted materials. Imprinted microspheres prepared from DVB crosslinker had larger and more defined spherical shape, and displayed better imprinting effect than did the EDMA-based microparticles. For comparison, imprinted bulk polymers were also prepared in the same reaction solvent as that used in precipitation polymerization. Elemental analysis results indicated that imprinted microspheres contained more template monomer units than bulk materials. The efficiency of template removal by hydrolysis treatment for microspheres was also higher than that for bulk polymers. For DVB-based polymers, imprinted microspheres displayed higher specific cholesterol uptake than did the corresponding bulk polymer. (c) 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Purification was accomplished by reverse-phase HPLC methods, providing [F-18]-2 in 59 +/- 8% radiochemical yield (EOB), with specific activity of 2.89 +/- 0.80 Ci/mu mol (EOS) and radiochemical purity of 98.3 +/- 2.1%. Rat biodistribution studies revealed relatively high uptake in many organs known to contain sigma-l receptors, including the lungs, kidney, heart, spleen, and brain. Good clearance from normal tissues was observed over time. Blocking studies (60 min) demonstrated high (> 80%) specific binding of [F-18]-2 in the brain, with reduction also noted in other organs known to express these sites.

In sea urchin egg homogenates, binding of NAADP to its receptor is not readily reversible; hence, prior incubation with low concentrations of NAADP is more effective in inhibiting subsequent binding of radiolabelled NAADP than incubating the preparation with the two ligands simultaneously [Patel, Churchill and Galione (2000) Biochem. J. 352, 725-729]. We extend this finding to show that NAADP is more effective still in inhibiting the subsequent radioligand binding at lower homogenate concentrations, an effect again quite probably due to the non-reversible nature of the receptor-ligand interaction. Enhanced sensitivity of the preparation to NAADP afforded by simple manipulation of the experimental conditions has been applied to determine low levels of NAADP in acid extracts from human red blood cells, rat hepatocytes and Escherichia coli without interference from NADP breakdown. Our improved method for the quantification of NAADP should prove useful in the further assessment of its signalling role within cells.

Here, we report that inhibition of PMN infiltration by ASA and DEX is a property shared by aspirin-triggered lipoxins (ATL) and the glucocorticoid-induced annexin 1 (ANXA1)-derived peptides that are both generated in vivo and act at the lipoxin A(4) receptor (ALXR/FPRL1) to halt PMN diapedesis. These structurally diverse ligands specifically interact directly with recombinant human ALXR demonstrated by specific radioligand binding and function as well as immunoprecipitation of PMN receptors. In addition, the combination of both ATL and ANXA1-derived peptides limited PMN infiltration and reduced production of inflammatory mediators (that is, prostaglandins and chemokines) in vivo. Together, these results indicate functional redundancies in endogenous lipid and peptide anti-inflammatory circuits that are spatially and temporally separate, where both ATL and specific ANXA1-derived peptides act in concert at ALXR to downregulate PMN recruitment to inflammatory loci.

Comprehensive functional analysis of family members is facilitated by access to a robust, stable and inducible expression system in a fly cell line. Here we show how the Schneider S2 cell line, derived from the Drosophila embryo, provides such an expression system, with the bonus that radioligand binding studies, second messenger assays, ion imaging, patch-clamp electrophysiology and gene silencing can readily be applied. Drosophila is also ideal for the study of new control strategies for insect pests since the receptors and ion channels that many new animal health drugs and crop protection chemicals target can be expressed in this cell line. In addition, many useful orthologues of human disease genes are emerging from the Drosophila genome and the study of their functions and interactions is another area for postgenome applications of S2 cell lines.

We examined the VNTR polymorphism of the 3' untranslated region of SLC6A3 and DAT protein availability in 14 abstinent alcoholics and II control subjects. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and plasma levels of the radioligand [I-123]beta-CIT were used to quantify DAT protein availability. Individuals with the 9-repeat/10-repeat genotype had a mean 22% reduction of DAT protein availability in putamen compared with 10-repeat homozygous individuals (t = 2.14, df = 23, p <.05). Consistent with earlier studies, alcoholism, per se, was not significantly associated with either DAT availability or DAT genotype. These findings suggest that the VNTR polymorphism of the DAT gene effects translation of the DAT protein. This effect may explain a variety of clinical associations that have been reported with this polymorphism. Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

The oxytocin receptor plays a key role in the onset of preterm labor. Cytokines likely regulate oxytocin receptor expression through several cytokine-induced DNA-binding proteins. METHOD OF STUDY: The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the IL-1 alone on oxytocin receptor number as measured by radioligand binding and immunocytochemistry, and oxytocin receptor mRNA as measured by reverse transriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in cultured uterine myocytes. RESULTS: Unexpectedly, IL-1 treatment decreased oxytocin receptor number from 111,067 to 23,941 receptors/cell. Loss of oxytocin receptor binding began after 8 hr of IL-1 treatment and was reversible after IL-1 removal. Immunocytochemistry confirmed a loss of cellular oxytocin receptors. Oxytocin receptor mRNA decreased beginning after 2 hr of IL-1 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: IL-1 down-regulates the uterine oxytocin receptor in a time- and dose-dependent fashion.

The syntheses of [C-11] 2a and [F-18] 2b were accomplished in a good yield with high specific activity. Ex vivo biodistribution studies in rats revealed that both [11C] 2a and [18F] 2b crossed the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and demonstrated good brain uptake 5 min post-injection. MicroPET imaging of [C-11] 2a in a non-human primate (NHP) confirmed that the tracer was able to cross the BBB with rapid washout kinetics from brain regions of a healthy macaque. The initial studies suggested that further structural optimization of [C-11] 2a and [F-18] 2b is necessary in order to identify a highly specific positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for in vivo imaging of alpha-synuclein aggregation in the central nervous system (CNS).

Tea catechins' affinity for human cannabinoid receptors	PHYTOMEDICINE			English	Article						Camellia sinensis; Catechins; Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate; Cannabinoid receptor; Neuroprotection	GREEN TEA; (-)-EPIGALLOCATECHIN GALLATE; EPIGALLOCATECHIN GALLATE; GALLOYL MOIETY; BLACK TEA; IN-VITRO; MECHANISMS; FLAVONOIDS; DIETARY; EXTRACT	Among the many known health benefits of tea catechins count anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective activities, as well as effects on the regulation of food intake. Here we address cannabimimetic bioactivity of catechin derivatives occurring in tea leaves as a possible cellular effector of these functionalities. Competitive radioligand binding assays using recombinant human cannabinoid receptors expressed in Chem-1 and CHO cells identified (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, EGCG (K-i=33.6 mu M), (-)-epigallocatechin, EGC (K-i=35.7 mu M), and (-)-epicatechin-3-O-gallate, ECC (K-i=47.3 mu M) as ligands with moderate affinity for type I cannabinoid receptors, CBI. Binding to CB2 was weaker with inhibition constants exceeding 50 mu M for EGC and ECG. The epimers (+)-catechin and (-)epicatechin exhibited negligible affinities for both CB1 and CB2. It can be concluded that central nervous cannabinoid receptors may be targeted by selected tea catechins but signaling via peripheral type receptors is less likely to play a major role in vivo.

J	Yin, LL; Zhu, XZ				Yin, LL; Zhu, XZ			The involvement of central cholinergic system in (+)-matrine-induced antinociception in mice	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						(+)-matrine; antinociception; central cholinergic system; atropine; opioid receptors; binding assay	MATRINE-TYPE ALKALOIDS; MECHANISM; ANALGESIA	The antinociceptive effect of (+)-matrine was examined in mice by writhing, tail-pressure and hot-plate tests. (+)-Matrine (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg s.c.) produced antinociception in a dose-dependent manner. In hot-plate test, the antinociception produced by (+)-matrine (10 mg/kg s.c.) was attenuated by muscarinic receptor antagonists atropine (5 mg/kg i.p.) and pirenzepine (0.1 mu g/mouse i.c.v.) and acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium-3 (HC-3) (1 mu g/mouse i.c.v.), but not by opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (2 mg/kg i.p.), dopamine D-2 receptor agonist (-)-quinpirole (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) or catecholamine depletor reserpine (2.5 mg/kg i.p.). Radioligand binding assay demonstrated that (+)-matrine had no affinity for mu-, kappa- or delta-opioid receptors in a wide concentration range (1 x 10(-11)-1 x 10(-3) M). The results suggest that (+)matrine exerts its antinociceptive effect through multiple mechanism(s) such as increasing cholinergic activation in the CNS rather than acting on opioid receptors directly.

The protein model has been generated by applying ligand-supported homology modeling, using mutational and ligand SAR data to guide the protein modeling procedure. We performed a virtual screening of the company's compound collection to test how well this model is suited to identify alpha1A antagonists. We applied a hierarchical virtual screening procedure guided by 2D filters and three-dimensional pharmacophore models. The ca. 23 000 filtered compounds were docked into the alpha1A homology model with GOLD and scored with PMF. From the top-ranked compounds, 80 diverse compounds were tested in a radioligand displacement assay. 37 compounds revealed K-i values better than 10 muM; the most active compound binds with 1.4 nM to the alpha1A receptor. Our findings suggest that rhodopsin-based homology models may be used as the structural basis for GPCR lead finding and compound optimization.

Previously, we successfully designed and synthesized a series of F-18-labeled PET molecular probes targeting alpha 7nAChR, which are mainly used in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Based on the characteristics of alpha 7nAChR in blood vessels, we have firstly screened for a suitable novel F-18-labeled PET molecular probe ([F-18]YLF-DW), with high selectivity for alpha 7nAChR over alpha 4 beta 2nAChR and a good effect for the imaging of atherosclerotic animal models, to effectively identify vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques at an early stage. Meanwhile, we compared it with the "gold standard" pathological examination of atherosclerosis, to verify the reliability of [F-18]YLF-DW in early diagnosis of atherosclerosis. Methods: The vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques model of ApoE-/-mice were successfully established. Then based on the methods of 3D-QSAR and molecular docking, we designed oxazolo[4,5-b] pyridines and fluorenone compounds, which are targeted at alpha 7nAChR. Through further screening, a novel alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor radioligand ([F-18]YLF-DW) was synthesized and automatically F-18-labeled using a Stynthra RNplus module. Subsequently, we employed [F-18]YLF-DW for the targeting of alpha 7nAChR in atherosclerotic plaques and control group, using a micro-PET/CT respectively. After imaging, the mice were sacrificed by air embolism and the carotid arteries taken out for making circular sections. The paraffin embedded specimens were sectioned with 5 mu m thickness and stained with oil red. After staining, immunohistochemistry experiment was carried out to verify the effect of micro-PET/CT imaging. Results: The micro-PET/CT imaging successfully identified the vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques in the carotid arteries of ApoE-/-mice; whereas, no signal was observed in normal control mice. In addition, compared with the traditional imaging agent [F-18]FDG, [F-18]YLF-DW had a significant effect on the early plaques imaging of carotid atherosclerosis. The results of oil red staining and immunohistochemistry also showed early formations of carotid plaques in ApoE-/-mice and provided pathological bases for the evaluation of imaging effect. Conclusion: We innovated to apply the novel molecular probe ([F-18]YLF-DW) to the identification of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques in carotid arteries, to detect atherosclerosis early inflammatory response and provide powerful input for the early diagnosis of atherosclerotic lesions, which may play an early warning role in cardiovascular acute events.

In the modern clinical practice somatostatin receptor molecular imaging and targeted radioligand therapy plays a vital role in the diagnosis and management of the disease. Several new and promising radiotracers for NET imaging and theranostics, belonging to various groups and classes are being studied and investigated. This exponential growth of radiotracers poses concerns about the indication, clinical benefit, and safety profile of the agents. We discuss the basis behind these radiotracers clinical use, receptor targeting and intra and inter tumor heterogeneity. Furthermore, role of dual tracer imaging, combination therapy and potential applications of dosimetry in predicting treatment outcome and safety profile is reviewed. Individualized precision medicine with better tumor characterization, maximum therapeutic benefit and minimum toxicity is the way forward for future medicine. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd.

Topography of Cholinergic Changes in Dementia With Lewy Bodies and Key Neural Network Hubs	JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHIATRY AND CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCES			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DENERVATION; ATTENTION	Objectives: The authors investigated the topography of cholinergic vulnerability in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) [F-18]- fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([F-18]- FEOBV) radioligand. Methods: Five elderly participants with DLB (mean age, 77.8 years [SD=4.2]) and 21 elderly healthy control subjects (mean age, 73.62 years [SD=8.37]) underwent clinical assessment and [F-18]-FEOBV PET. Results: Compared with the healthy control group, reduced VAChT binding in patients with DLB demonstrated non-diffuse regionally distinct and prominent reductions in bilateral opercula and anterior cingulate to mid-cingulate cortices, bilateral insula, right (more than left) lateral geniculate nuclei, pulvinar, right proximal optic radiation, bilateral anterior and superior thalami, and posterior hippocampal fimbria and fornices. Conclusions: The topography of cholinergic vulnerability in DLB comprises key neural hubs involved in tonic alertness (cingulo-opercular), saliency (insula), visual attention (visual thalamus), and spatial navigation (fimbria/fornix) networks. The distinct denervation pattern suggests an important cholinergic role in specific clinical disease-defining features, such as cognitive fluctuations, visuoperceptual abnormalities causing visual hallucinations, visuospatial changes, and loss of balance caused by DLB.

By means of solid-phase or solution-phase Suzuki-Miyaura cross-couplings, various substituted regioisomers of the phenylalanine moiety in position 3 of the sequence were prepared. An 18-membered library of opioid tetrapeptides was generated via screening of the chemical space around the Phe(3) side chain. These substitutions modulated bioactivity, receptor subtype selectivity and highly effective ligands with subnanomolar binding affinities, contributed to higher functional activities and potent analgesic actions. In search of selective peptidic ligands, we show here that the Suzuki-Miyaura reaction is a versatile and robust tool which could also be deployed elsewhere. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Fluorescence polarization (FP) assay portrays an essential role in HTS; however, in many cases, it was restricted by the absence of FP probes, the narrow measurement window, and low signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Herein, based on the modification of our previous probe 1 (QFL), we discovered an FP probe 3 (QGGFL) for alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(1)-ARs), which has satisfactory fluorescence intensity, specific binding ability to receptors, and suitable fluorescence properties that were compatible with the filters in the FP system. Meanwhile, an "ELISA-like" strategy was designed for FP-based HTS assay in which proteins were adhered into a solid phase to improve the measurement window and S/N ratio. With fluorescent antagonist QGGFL and the ELISA strategy, we succeeded in lestablishing the first competitive binding FP assay for alpha(1)-AR antagonists as the alternative of the radioligand binding assay.

Changes in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> Receptor Expression in Untreated, <i>de novo</i> Patients with Parkinson's Disease	JOURNAL OF PARKINSONS DISEASE			English	Article						5-HT2A receptor; serotonin; Parkinson's disease; neuroimaging	VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; INVERSE AGONIST; MESSENGER-RNAS; DEPRESSION; MODEL; PIMAVANSERIN; EMISSION; BINDING; RATS	Background: Serotonin (5-HT) has long been implied in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, the 5-HT2A receptor is associated with the regulation of motor function and mood. Objective: To assess regional 5-HT2A receptor expression in unmedicated patients with de novo PD. Methods: Eight de novo, drug naive patients with PD and eight healthy control subjects underwent a single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan with the highly selective 5-HT2A radioligand I-123-5-I-R91150. Results: In de novo PD patients 5-HT2A receptor binding was significantly reduced in the anterior striatum and the premotor cortex in PD patients compared to controls. In addition, occipital binding was elevated in PD patients. No changes in 5-HT2A receptor binding were found in the prefrontal and parietal cortex. Conclusion: In de novo PD patients, 5-HT2A receptor expression is changed in key areas of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor circuit and occipital cortex. This suggests altered 5-HT neurotransmission to contribute to development of PD motor and non-motor symptoms.	[Melse, Maartje; Tan, Sonny K. H.; Temel, Yasin; Leentjens, Albert F.

[F-18]4 was prepared using a one-pot two-step method with total radiochemical yield 21.2 % (decay-corrected). The molar radioactivity was around 135 GBq/mu mol and the radiochemical purity was greater than 95.5 %. The partition coefficient (Log P) of [F-18]4 was determined to be 2.10 +/- A 0.30 through octanol experiment. The in vivo biodistribution and the competitive distribution of [F-18]4 in rat exposed that the tracer passes through blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and may specifically bind to D-4 receptor. Metabolite analysis revealed that there was no metabolism of [F-18]4 in brain. Conclusively, these preliminary results demonstrated that [F-18]4 shows promises as a radioligand for the in vivo study of dopamine D-4 receptor.

C-60 fullerenes have shown biochemical and biomedical properties in the last years such as as blockade of apoptosis and neuroprotection. The nucleoside adenosine has a neuroprotective role mainly due to inhibition of glutamate release, which is a neurotransmitter related to excitotoxicity and cell death. In the present work, we have determined the presence of adenosine receptors in SK-N-MC cells, a neuroepithelioma human cell line, and analyzed the effect of fullerenes in these receptors by using radioligand binding, immunoblotting, and quantitative real time PCR assays. Results demonstrated that SK-N-MC cells endogenously express adenosine receptors, Fullerene exposure of these cells did not affect cell viability measured by MTT reduction assay. However, adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors were both increased in SK-N-MC cells after treatment. These results suggest for the first time the modulation of adenosine receptors after C-60 fullerenes exposure.

This approach was applied to LY-334370, a selective agonist of 5-HT1F receptor, to generate structurally well-defined divalent molecules. Radioligand binding assays to three cloned 5-HT1 receptor subtypes (5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F) demonstrated that the affinity of a series of homologous dimers varied significantly upon exploration of three structural variables (linker length, attachment position, functionality). In particular, the series of C-3-to-C-3 linked dimers derived from a monomer (3) showed high binding affinity to 5-HT1D (for example, K-i approximate to 0.3 nM for dimer 8) but did not bind to 5-HTIF (K-i > 0.01 mM), providing > 10000-fold subtype selectivity. Results from a functional assay (rabbit saphenous vein contraction) demonstrate that certain dimers are 5-HT1 receptor agonists.	[Choi, Seok-Ki; Green, David; Marquess, Daniel; Turner, S.

Monitoring the function of membrane transport proteins in detergent-solubilized form	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						membrane protein; neurotransmitter : sodium symporter; scintillation proximity; substrate binding	DEPENDENT NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; SCINTILLATION PROXIMITY ASSAY; CONTROLLED GENE-EXPRESSION; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; LACTOSE PERMEASE; BACTERIAL HOMOLOG; BINDING; FLUORESCENCE; RECEPTORS	Transport proteins constitute approximate to 10% of most proteomes and play vital roles in the translocation of solutes across membranes of all organisms. Their (dys)function is implicated in many disorders, making them frequent targets for pharmacotherapy. The identification of substrates for members of this large protein family, still replete with many orphans of unknown function, has proven difficult, in part because high-throughput screening is greatly complicated by endogenous transporters present in many expression systems. In addition, direct structural studies require that transporters be extracted from the membrane with detergent, thereby precluding transport measurements because of the lack of a vectorial environment and necessitating reconstitution into proteoliposomes for activity measurements. Here, we describe a direct scintillation proximity-based radioligand-binding assay for determining transport protein function in crude cell extracts and in purified form. This rapid and universally applicable assay with advantages over cell-based platforms will greatly facilitate the identification of substrates for many orphan transporters and allows monitoring the function of transport proteins in a nonmembranous environment.

We measured 5-HT4 receptors in the postmortem frontal and temporal cortex of 34 AD subjects and 15 controls by radioligand binding with [H-3]GR113808. Receptor binding data was then correlated with prospectively assessed cognitive (Mini-Mental State Examination, MMSE) and behavioral (Present Behavioural Examination, PBE) data. [H-3]GR113808 binding affinity (K-D) and density (B-max) in AD were unchanged compared to controls in both cortical regions, and did not correlate with MMSE or PBE data. The binding parameters were also not related to disease duration, senile plaque and neurofibrillary tangle counts, and neuroleptic medication. We conclude that unlike other 5-HT receptors, 5-HT4 receptor binding affinity and density do not seem to be affected in the frontal and temporal cortex in AD and may not have a direct role in the clinical features of the disease.

Lidocaine (100 muM) augmented the relaxant responses to forskolin in the bovine tracheal smooth muscle contracted with methacholine (0.3 muM). On the other hand, lidocaine failed to affect the relaxant effects of forskolin on the histamine (100 muM)- and KCl (40 mM)-contracted preparations. Lidocaine (100 muM) enhanced both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the presence of methacholine (0.3 muM). However, in the absence of methacholine, neither basal nor forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation was affected by lidocaine. Similar phenomenon was observed when the bovine tracheal smooth muscles were treated with methoctramine (0.03 muM). In radioligand binding experiments, lidocaine inhibited [H-3]N-methyl scopolamine binding to cloned human muscarinic receptors (M-1-M-5) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that lidocaine prevents muscarinic receptor-mediated signaling pathway and thereby reverses inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by methacholine in bovine tracheal smooth muscle.

Surface plasmon resonance was used to quantify the binding of ligands and antibodies to the receptor. The orientation and structural integrity of the surface-reconstituted receptor was probed using monoclonal antibodies, demonstrating that approximately 65% of the receptors present their ligand-binding site towards the lumen of the flow cell and that at least 85% of these receptors are structurally intact. The conformation of the receptor in tethered membranes was investigated with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and found to be practically identical to that of receptors reconstituted in lipid vesicles. The affinity of small receptor ligands was determined in a competition assay against a monoclonal antibody directed against the ligand-binding site which yielded dissociation constants in agreement with radioligand binding assays. The presented method for the functional immobilisation of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in tethered membranes might be generally applicable to other membrane proteins.

In vivo PET imaging offers an opportunity to gain critical information about MT changes with the onset and development of AD and related dementia. We developed the first brain-penetrant MT PET ligand, [C-11]MPC-6827, and evaluated its in vivo imaging utility in vervet monkeys. Consistent with our previous in vitro cell uptake and in vivo rodent imaging experiments, [C-11]MPC-6827 uptake increased with MT destabilization. Radioactive uptake was inversely related to (cerebrospinal fluid) CSF A beta(42) levels and directly related to age in a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of AD. Additionally, in vitro autoradiography studies also corroborated PET imaging results. Here, we report the preliminary results of PET imaging with [C-11]MPC-6827 in four female vervet monkeys with high or low CSF A beta(42) levels, which have been shown to correlate with the A beta plaque burden, similar to humans.

In an unbiased search for novel mu OR agonists in food, a three-step virtual-screening process selected 22 promising candidates with potential to interact with the mu OR. Radioligand binding studies showed that ten of these substances indeed bind to the receptor. Functional assays identified kukoamine A as a full agonist (EC50 = 5.6 mu M) and kukoamine B as a partial agonist (EC50 = 8.7 mu M) to mu OR. After extraction, both kukoamines were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in potato, tomato, pepper, and eggplant. Depending on the potato variety, up to 16 mu g of kukoamine A and 157 mu g of kukoamine B per gram dry weight could be determined in the whole tuber, mainly concentrated in the potato peel. Cooking did not influence the kukoamine contents.

Spectroscopic studies including UV/Vis absorption and fluorescence measurements showed that the synthesized fluorescent probes exhibit favorable spectroscopic properties, especially in nonpolar environments. In vitro fluorescence staining in brain sections from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected mice revealed partial colocalization of the probes with the TSPO. The TSPO binding affinity of the probes was measured on crude mitochondrial fractions separated from rat brain homogenates in a [C-11]PK11195 radioligand binding assay. All the new fluorescent probes demonstrated moderate to high binding affinity to the TSPO, with affinity (K-i) values ranging from 0.58 nM to 3.28 mu M. Taking these data together, we propose that the new fluorescent probes could be used to visualize the TSPO.

Synthesis of the reference standard MOV (3), and its desmethyl precursor 2 for radiolabeling were performed using 1,2-diphenylethan-1-one as the starting material in five steps with 15% overall yield. Radiosynthesis of [C-11]MOV was accomplished in 40 +/- 10% yield and > 99% radiochemical purity by reacting the precursor 2 in dimethyl formamide (DMF) with [C-11] CH3I followed by removal of the dimethoxytrityl (DMT) protective group using trifluroacetic acid. PET studies in anesthetized baboon showed very low uptake and homogeneous distribution of [C-11]MOV in brain. The radioligand underwent rapid metabolism in baboon plasma. MicroPET studies in male Sprague Dawley rats revealed [C-11]MOV binding in lower thorax. The tracer binding in rats was partially blocked in heart and duodenum by the administration of 1 mg/kg oral dose of COX-2 inhibitor valdecoxib.

Macrophage uptake of folate-conjugated porphysomes was selective. Folate-porphysome cardiac macrophage tracking was detected in vivo using radioligand and fluorescent imaging. To track post-MI macrophage mobilization, cardiac fluorescence signal in folate-porphysome-injected mice was measured for 9 day post-MI. Active macrophage phenotype was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Heart active macrophage presence peaked on day 1, returned to baseline by day 3, and peaked again on day 7 post-MI. Macrophages were distributed throughout the left ventricle at day 1, but aggregated within scar tissue at day 7. Macrophage phenotype was pro-inflammatory (TNF alpha(+)) at day 1, whereas scar-resident macrophages expressed anti-inflammatory markers (IL-10, TGF beta) at day 7. However, day 7 macrophages outside the scar expressed neither pro- nor anti-inflammatory markers. We established that folate-porphysomes are suitable for non-invasive imaging of macrophages and used it to investigate active macrophage behavior in the infarcted heart.

Thus, the development of novel alpha 2-AR antagonists represents an attractive source of new antidepressants. This paper describes the design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of 30 new guanidinium and 2-iminoimidazolidinium as potential alpha 2-AR antagonists. In order to design this new series of alpha 2-AR antagonists, a pharmacophore model was developed using the GALAHAD software. This study suggested that increased substitution in the space surrounding the cationic guanidine moiety might lead selectively to antagonist activity. Following the preparation of compounds incorporating this feature and competitive radioligand binding, [S-35]GTP gamma S functional assays revealed that this structural modification affords exclusively alpha 2-AR antagonists, in contrast with the analogous unsubstituted compounds in which a mixture of antagonist/agonist activities was previously observed.

Assuming a functional interdependence of these substrates, we hypothesized that a low-fear behavioral phenotype due to bilateral lesion of the amygdala would be associated with significant 5-HT2A receptor changes. Thus, we used [F-18]altanserin positron emission tomography (PET) referenced to radioligand plasma levels and corrected for partial volume effects to quantify the spatial distribution of 5-HT2A receptor binding potential (BPP) in a rare patient with UrbachWiethe disease and selective bilateral amygdala calcification damage relative to 10 healthy control subjects. Consistent with our a priori hypothesis, we observed a 70 global decrease in 5-HT2A receptor BPP in the UrbachWiethe patient relative to controls. Thus, brain abnormalities in this patient are not restricted to the amygdala, but extend to overall 5-HT neurotransmission via 5-HT2A receptors. Our findings provide important insights into the molecular architecture of human anxiety behaviors and suggest the 5-HT2A receptor as a promising pharmacological target to control pathological anxiety.

The introduction of avidin membrane onto the biotin-SAM electrode surface caused the large changes in the electrode response of thr redox marker. By using NutrAvidin instead of avidin, it was clarified that the changes of the electrode response were ascribed to the permeability of the marker through the avidin membrane on the electrode surface. At a lower pH than the isoelectric point of avidin, the electrode response of ferrocyanide ions as an anionic redox marker ions increased linearly over thr range of 1.25 x 10(-9)-1.25 x 10(-8) M avidin. The relative standard deviation at 2.25 x 10(-9) M avidin was about 3.9% (n = 5). On the other hand, the detection of biotin was performed using a competitive reaction between biotin in the solution and biotin in SAM on the electrode surface for avidin.

The value of Ga-68-PSMA-directed PET imaging as a diagnostic procedure for primary and recurrent PC as well as the role of evolving PSMA radioligand therapy (PRLT) in castration-resistant (CR)PC is assessed. The most eminent data from mostly retrospective studies currently available on theranostics of prostate cancer are discussed. The current knowledge on Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT implicates that primary staging with PET/CT is meaningful in patients with high-risk PC and that the combination with pelvic multi parametric (mp)MR (or PET/mpMR) reaches the highest impact on patient management. There may be a place for Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT in intermediate-risk PC patients as well, however, only a few data are available at the moment. In secondary staging for local recurrence, Ga-68-PSMA PET/mpMR is superior to PET/CT, whereas for distant recurrence, PET/CT has equivalent results and is faster and cheaper compared to PET/mpMR. Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT is superior to F-18 / (11)Choline PET/CT in primary staging as well as in secondary staging. In patients with biochemical relapse, PET/CT positivity is directly associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase and amounts to roughly 50% when PSA is raised to <= 0.5 ng/ml and to >= 90% above 1 ng/ml. Significant clinical results have so far been achieved with the subsequent use of radiolabeled PSMA ligands in the treatment of CRPC. Accumulated activities of 30 to 50 GBq of Lu-177-PSMA ligands seem to be clinically safe with biochemical response and PERCIST/RECIST response in around 75% of patients along with xerostomia in 5-10% of patients as the only notable side effect. On the basis of the current literature, we conclude that PSMA-directed theranostics do have a major clinical impact in diagnosis and therapy of PC patients. We recommend that Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT should be performed in primary staging together with pelvic mpMR in high-risk patients and in all patients for secondary staging, and that PSMA-directed therapy is a potent strategy in CRPC patients when other treatment options have failed. The combination of PSMA-directed therapy with existing therapy modalities (such as Ra-223-chloride or androgen deprivation therapy) has to be explored, and prospective clinical multicenter trials with theranostics are warranted.

Presynaptic dopamine transporter (DaT) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging is the most commonly used imaging technique in clinical practice to differentiate degenerative Parkinson's disease (PD) and PD plus syndromes from other causes such as essential tremor and drug-induced parkinsonism. This can help identify the patients who would benefit from medical therapy due to underlying pre-synaptic dopaminergic deficits. We report a case of unilateral parkinsonism caused by ipsilateral substantia nigra micro-haemorrhage resulting in disruption of the nigrostriatal pathway. This is an unusual case of a 55-year-old male patient who presented with unilateral Parkinsonism a decade after significant head trauma where MRI plays a critical and complementary role in diagnosing complete interruption of the nigrostriatal pathway due to cerebral micro-haemorrhage. The case also beautifully demonstrates the anatomy of the nigrostriatal pathway where a small lesion in the substantia nigra caused complete loss of radioligand uptake in the ipsilateral corpus striatum. Physicians should be aware of the importance of structural imaging in atypical movement disorder cases and, in particular, the routine use of susceptibility-weighted sequences (SWI).

Development of Covalent Ligands for G Protein-Coupled Receptors: A Case for the Human Adenosine A<sub>3</sub> Receptor	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SULFONYL FLUORIDES; MOLECULAR PROBES; ANTAGONIST; DERIVATIVES; CELLS; RADIOLIGAND; KINETICS; AGONISTS	The development of covalent ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is not a trivial process. Here, we report a streamlined workflow thereto from synthesis to validation, exemplified by the discovery of a covalent antagonist for the human adenosine A(3) receptor (hA(3)AR). Based on the 1H,3H-pyrido[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione scaffold, a series of ligands bearing a fluorosulfonyl warhead and a varying linker was synthesized. This series was subjected to an affinity screen, revealing compound 17b as the most potent antagonist. In addition, a nonreactive methylsulfonyl derivative 19 was developed as a reversible control compound. A series of assays, comprising time-dependent affinity determination, washout experiments, and [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays, then validated 17b as the covalent antagonist. A combined in silico hA(3)AR-homology model and site-directed mutagenesis study was performed to demonstrate that amino acid residue Y265(7.36) was the unique anchor point of the covalent interaction. This workflow might be applied to other GPCRs to guide the discovery of covalent ligands.	[Yang, Xue; van Veldhoven, Jacobus P.

This difference can be explained by comparing values of kinetic rate constants, which characterize interaction of these tracers with DAT sites in vitro. At the same time, this kinetic analysis showed that the overall binding mechanism is similar for these two tracers and includes a fast step of complex formation followed by a slow isomerization step of this complex. Comparison with previous PE2I data revealed that isomerization of the DAT complex with PE2I occurs three times faster than in the case of FE-PE2I, which leads to the slower onset of peak specific binding of the former tracer in the DAT-rich regions. Therefore, ligands with slower isomerization on-rate, including [F-18]FE-PE2I, seem to be better tracers in vivo, and their properties can be predicted in vitro.

The reported alkyl 2-cyanoimino-4-substituted-6-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahy-dropyrimidine-5-carboxylates (16) were designed by bioisosteric replacement of the carbonyl group at position 2 in a series of 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2-ones. The scaffold (16) documented herein contains a chiral center at the heterocycle. Accordingly, the most attractive ligand of the series [(+/-)16b, K-i = 24.3 nM] was resolved into its two enantiomers by chiral HPLC, and the absolute configuration was established by circular dichroism. The biological evaluation of both enantiomers demonstrated enantiospecific recognition at A(2B)AR, with the (S)-16b enantiomer retaining all the affinity (K-i = 15.1 nM), as predicted earlier by molecular modeling. This constitutes the first example of enantiospecific recognition at the A(2B) adenosine receptor and opens new possibilities in ligand design for this receptor.

A novel CCR2 antagonist inhibits atherogenesis in apoE deficient mice by achieving high receptor occupancy	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; STRUCTURE-AFFINITY RELATIONSHIPS; APOLIPOPROTEIN E-DEFICIENT; IN-VIVO EFFICACY; BINDING-KINETICS; CHEMOKINE RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; REDUCES ATHEROSCLEROSIS; LIGAND; VITRO	CC Chemokine Receptor 2 (CCR2) and its endogenous ligand CCL2 are involved in a number of diseases, including atherosclerosis. Several CCR2 antagonists have been developed as potential therapeutic agents, however their in vivo clinical efficacy was limited. In this report, we aimed to determine whether 15a, an antagonist with a long residence time on the human CCR2, is effective in inhibiting the development of atherosclerosis in a mouse disease model. First, radioligand binding assays were performed to determine affinity and binding kinetics of 15a on murine CCR2. To assess the in vivo efficacy, western-type diet fed apoE(-/-) mice were treated daily with 15a or vehicle as control. Treatment with 15a reduced the amount of circulating CCR2(+) monocytes and the size of the atherosclerotic plaques in both the carotid artery and the aortic root. We then showed that the long pharmacokinetic half-life of 15a combined with the high drug concentrations ensured prolonged CCR2 occupancy. These data render 15a a promising compound for drug development and confirms high receptor occupancy as a key parameter when targeting chemokine receptors.

Influence of <i>TSPO</i> Genotype on <SUP>11</SUP>C-PBR28 Standardized Uptake Values	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						C-11-PBR28; positron emission tomography; TSPO; genotype	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN 18 KDA; OLDER-ADULTS; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PET RADIOLIGAND; BINDING-SITES; HUMAN BRAIN; HUMANS; IMAGE; BIODISTRIBUTION	C-11-PBR28 binds to the high-affinity state of the translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO). A single-nucleotide polymorphism (rs6971) within the human TSPO gene determines the affinity state of the TSPO. The rs6971 genotype determines whether individuals express the high-, low-, or mixed-affinity phenotype of TSPO. The rs6971 genotype corresponds to in vivo C-11-PBR28 binding, as measured quantitatively by total volume of distribution. However, it is not known whether standardized uptake value (SUV) can detect differences in brain C-11-PBR28 uptake by TSPO genotype. Methods: Thirty-two older adults (71.8 +/- 7.94 y old) underwent C-11-PBR28 PET scanning; rs6971 genotype was imputed after genomewide genotyping. SUV was extracted for several brain regions. The sample included 19 C/C carriers (high-affinity phenotype), 12 T/C carriers (mixed-affinity), and 1 T/T carrier (low-affinity) for rs6971. Results: SUV was 30% lower in T/C subjects than in C/C subjects. Conclusion: The results indicate that brain C-11-PBR28 SUV is sensitive to TSPO genotype.

Design, Synthesis, and Biological Evaluation of Nonsteroidal Cycloalkane[<i>d</i>]isoxazole-Containing Androgen Receptor Modulators	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROSTATE-CANCER; STRUCTURAL BASIS; DISCOVERY; POTENT; SERIES; ANTIANDROGEN; MUTATIONS; MUSCLE; ACCOMMODATION; RESISTANCE	We report here the design, preparation, and systematic evaluation of a novel cycloalkane[d]isoxazole pharmacophoric fragment-containing androgen receptor (AR) modulators. Cycloalkane[d]isoxazoles form new core structures that interact with the hydrophobic region of the AR ligand-binding domain. To systematize and rationalize the RI structure activity relationship of the new fragment, we used molecular modeling to design a molecular library containing over 40 cycloalkane[d]isoxazole derivatives. The most potent compound, 4-(3a,4,5,6,7,7a-hexahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-yl)2-(trifluoromethyl)benzonitrile (6a), exhibits antiandrogenic activity significantly greater than that of the most widely used antiandrogenic prostate cancer drugs bicalutamide (1) and hydroxyflutamide (2) in reporter gene assays measuring the transcriptional activity of AR (decreasing approximately 90% of the total AR activity) and in competitive AR ligand-binding assays (showing over four times higher potency to inhibit radioligand binding in comparison to bicalutamide). Notably, 6a maintains its antiandrogenic activity with AR mutants W741L and T877A commonly observed and activated by bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, respectively, in prostate cancer patients.

MMPs belong to the zinc- and calcium-dependent endopeptidases which are involved in the proteolytic degradation of components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) but also are capable of processing and releasing bioactive molecules such as growth factors, proteinase inhibitors, and cytokines. Locally increased levels of activated MMPs modulate and contribute to the progression of various diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis, stroke, arthritis, and others. Therefore, activated MMPs are suitable biological targets for the specific and noninvasive visualization of aforementioned pathologies in vivo. On the basis of our recent results, we here describe a series of new fluorinated pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones of the second generation with maintained MAP inhibition potencies (IC50 = 4-605 nM), which are fine-tuned toward more hydrophilic versions, and show the improved biodistribution behavior of one selected radiofluorinated pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione by means of small-animal PET.

Estrogen binding sites in the sea scallop: Characterization and possible involvement in reproductive regulation	COMPARATIVE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY B-BIOCHEMISTRY & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Placopecten magellanicus; sex steroid; estrogen; estrogen binding sites; estrogen receptor; radioligand; saturation analysis; competitive analysis	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS; OCTOPUS-VULGARIS; MYTILUS-EDULIS; PATINOPECTEN-YESSOENSIS; PROGESTERONE-RECEPTORS; GONADAL DEVELOPMENT; STEROID-HORMONES; MYA-ARENARIA	Previous reports have suggested that estrogen is involved in bivalve reproduction and have also hypothesized that its effects are mediated through binding sites on specific receptors. In this study, we provide initial characterization of the estrogen binding sites in the gonads of both female and male sea scallops (Placopecten magellanicus). Saturation analyses indicated two binding sites in fractions which have classically been used to represent the cytosol and the nucleus. One binding site is characterized by high affinity and limited binding capacity while the other site is characterized by low affinity and high capacity. Competitive binding analyses demonstrated that these sites can bind natural and synthetic estrogens with high affinity but only bind testosterone and progesterone at high concentrations. Comparison of binding capacity in scallops at different sexual maturation stages suggested that these sites may be involved in reproductive regulation in sea scallops. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The non-invasive measurement of activated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in vivo, which are involved in many pathophysiological and pathological processes occurring in inflammation, cancer and atherosclerosis, is a clinical challenge. A diagnostic tool for the non-invasive detection of MMP activity in vivo is based on MMP inhibitor (MMPI) radiotracers. Methods. We chose non-peptidyl broad-spectrum MMPI CGS 27023A 1 as a hydroxamic acid-based lead structure to design such a tracer. Results. The radioligand HO-[I-123]I-CGS 27023A was able to specifically visualize activated MMPs in vascular lesions of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice in vivo. Based upon this work the radiosynthesis of a fluorinated analogue of the MMP inhibitor CGS 27023A was developed. its unlabeled counterpart was found to be a potent MMP inhibitor in vitro. Conclusion. Application of this; class of MMP-targeting agents in combination with molecular imaging modalities, such as positron emission tomography, may emerge as a novel clinical diagnostic tool in the management of human diseases with MMP misexpression and/or dysregulation.

Although the desensitization rate of nAChD receptors is highly variable, pharmacology is largely independent of desensitization rate. Because desensitized states tightly bind agonists, nAChD receptors are potently inhibited by neonicotinoids and specifically measured in radiolabeled imidacloprid binding assays. However, they are not usually detected in binding assays with radiolabeled a-bungarotoxin, which has a K-d for the resting state of 21 nM, but binds poorly to desensitized states often present in binding assays. In contrast, nAChN receptors are specifically measured in binding assays with radiolabeled alpha-bungarotoxin, which binds them with a K-d of 1.3 nM. nAChN receptors are activated by neonicotinoids at micromolar concentrations, and allosterically by spinosyn A, with an EC50 of 27 nM. Spinosyn A weakly antagonizes nAChD receptors -23% at 10 muM. The roles of the two nAChR subtypes in insecticide poisoning are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Galanin I nM significantly and substantially increased the K-d value of the [H-3] p-aminoclonidine binding sites in the medial hypothalamus and amygdala by 86% (p<0.01) and 73% (p<0.05) respectively. The B-max value was only significantly increased with 3 nM galanin in the amygdala and the medial hypothalamus (both p<0.05). The antagonist M35 counteracted the increase of the K-d values of the <alpha>2-adrenoceptor agonist binding sites produced by galanin 1 nM in the amygdala and the medial hypothalamus (both P < 0.001). These findings suggest the existence of an antagonistic galanin/<alpha>2 adrenoceptor interaction in the medial hypothalamus and amygdala that may be of relevance for alpha2-adrenoceptor-regulated neuroendocrine functions and food intake.

To induce reductions in cortical cholinergic input, the cholinergic immunotoxin 192IgG-saporin was employed. This has been shown to selectively and efficiently destroy basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in rats. The efficiency of the immunolesion was verified by histochemical acetylcholinesterase staining. [I-125]-IBVM binding before and after lesioning was measured using autoradiography. Basal forebrain cholinergic cell loss resulted in a considerable reduction in [I-125]-IBVM binding in the cholinoceptive target regions, but not in the striatum and cerebellum, brain regions that do not receive a cholinergic input by the basal forebrain cholinergic nuclei, suggesting that [I-123]-IBVM has potential in imaging cortical cholinergic deficits in vivo, at least in animals.

This compound was given the name, GluCAB(glucose-chelator-albumin-binder)-maleimide-1. Radiolabelled GluCAB-maleimide-1 and subsequent bioconjugate is proposed for prospective oncological applications and works on the theoretical dualtargeting principle of tumour localization through the "enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect" and glucose metabolism. Methods: The precursor, GluCAB-amine-2, and subsequent GluCAB-maleimide-1 was synthesised via sequential regioselective, distal N-functionalisation of a cyclam template with a tether containing a synthetically-derived beta-glucoside followed by a second linker to incorporate a maleimide moiety for albumin-binding. GluCAB-mine-2 was radiolabelled with [Cu-64]CuCl2 in 0.1 M NH4OAc (pH 3.5, 90 degrees C, 30 min), purified and converted post-labeling in 0.01 M PBS to [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-maleimide-1. Serum stability and protein binding studies were completed according to described methods. Healthy BALB/c ice (three groups of n = 5) were injected intravenously with [Cu-64]Cu-TETA, [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-amine-2 or [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-maleimide-1 and imaged using microPET/CT at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h post-injection. Biodistribution of the compounds were determined ex vivo after 24 h using gamma counting. Results: GluCAB-maleimide-1 was synthesised in five consecutive steps with an overall yield of 11%. [64Cu]Cu-GluCAB-amine-2 (97% labelling efficiency) was converted to [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-maleimide-1 (93% conversion; 90% radiochemical purity). Biodistribution analysis indicated that the control compounds were rapidly and almost completely excreted as compared to [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-maleimide-1 that exhibited a prolonged biological half-life (6-8h). Both, [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-maleimide-1 and -amine-2were excreted through the hepatobiliary system but a higher hepatic presence of the albumin-bound compound was noted. Conclusions, advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: This initial evaluation paves the way for further investigation into the tumour targeting potential of [Cu-64]Cu-GluCAB-maleimide-1. An efficient targeted radioligand will allow for further development of a prospective theranostic agent for more personalized patient treatment which potentially improves overall patient prognosis, outcome and health care.

J	Seeman, P				Seeman, P			Antipsychotic drugs, dopamine receptors, and schizophrenia	CLINICAL NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH			English	Article						antipsychotic drugs; dopamine receptors; schizophrenia	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; I-123 IBZM SPECT; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; D-2 RECEPTORS; CLOZAPINE; OCCUPANCY; BRAIN; 5-HT2	The clinical potencies of antipsychotic drugs are directly related to their affinities for the dopamine D2 receptor. In addition. the concentrations of antipsychotic drugs (given at therapeutic maintenance doses) in the plasma water or in the spinal fluid are almost identical to the anti psychotic dissociation constants at the dopamine D2 receptor. A consistent 70-75% of brain D2 receptors are occupied by antipsychotic drugs. as calculated from) the therapeutic concentration and the antipsychotic dissociation constant. The D3 and D4 dopamine receptors. however. are not consistently occupied by antipsychotic drugs the occupancies being 0-85% for D3, and 0-95% for D4. Human brain imaging also reveals that therapeutic doses of antipsychotic drugs occupy similar to70% of D2 receptors. Between 2 and 4 h after the daily oral dose, clozapine and quetiapine occupy high levels (similar to70%) of the dopamine D2 receptors in schizophrenia patients. with lower occupancies at 6 and 12 h. Although clozapine and quetiapine occupy low levels of D2 receptors many hours after the oral dose. the observed fraction of D2 receptors occupied by these drugs, however. depends on the radioligand used. with high occupancy seen when using [C-11]ractopride. and low occupancy seen with [C-11]methylspiperone (which is tightly bound to D2). This dependence on the radioligand occurs because clozapine and quetiapine are loosely bound to D2. The loose binding of clozapine and quetiapine to D2 permits endogenous dopamine to displace these antipsychotic drugs much more quickly than haloperidol. In addition. the small dose of radioactive raclopride injected (in brain imaging) can displace a little of the D2-bound clozapine, Hence. the observed low level of D2 occupancy by clozapine in patients may arise from a combination of the above three factors - the ligand dependency. the endogenous dopamine, and the displacement by the imaging dose. Parkinsonism and extrapyramidal effects occur with antipsychotics which have a high affinity for D2 and which are, therefore, tightly bound to D2. Clozapine and quetiapine have a low affinity for D2. and, being readily displaced by endogenous dopamine. do not give rise to extrapyramidal effects. Because the loosely bound antipyschotics dissociate from D2 more rapidly, clinical relapse may occur earlier than that found with the tightly bound traditional antipsychotics. The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia is supported by the fact that D2 is the main target of antipsychotic action, that monomers of D2 appear elevated in schizophrenia. and that the synaptic levels of dopamine in schizophrenia are at least two-fold higher than in control subjects.

In this study a correlation between total tumor volume (TTV) and measured kidney dose as well as salivary glands (SG) uptake in Lu-177-PSMA-617 therapy was evaluated. Methods: Eleven consecutive prostate cancer patients receiving a first cylcle of Lu-177-PSMA-617 (administered activity of approximately 6 GBq) were included. The Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan previous to therapy was used to determine TTV and SG uptake (glandulae submandibularis) employing PMOD version 3.403 with different Ga-68-PSMA-11 thresholds based on the standardized uptake value (SUV). The kidney dose was estimated with the software ULMDOS using planar whole-body scintigrams. Results: Kidney dose and SG uptake was inversely correlated to TTV, indicating high kidney dose and high SG uptake in case of low tumor load and low kidney dose and low SG uptake in case of high tumor load. Conclusion: Our data support the hypothesis that in Lu-177-PSMA-617 therapy an individualized treatment activity based on total tumor volume could be beneficiary.

Prediction of consensus binding mode geometries for related chemical series of positive allosteric modulators of adenosine and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						ischemic; inosine; LUF6000; Cl-IB-MECA; MRS-542	ADENOSINE-A1-RECEPTOR BINDING; A(2A) RECEPTOR; AMINO-ACIDS; AGONIST; ENHANCEMENT; XANOMELINE; INSIGHTS	Following insights from recent crystal structures of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, binding modes of Positive Allosteric Modulators (PAMs) were predicted under the assumption that PAMs should bind to the extracellular surface of the active state. A series of well-characterized PAMs for adenosine (A(1)R, A(2A)R, A(3)R) and muscarinic acetylcholine (M1R, M5R) receptors were modeled using both rigid and flexible receptor CHARMM-based molecular docking. Studies of adenosine receptors investigated the molecular basis of the probe-dependence of PAM activity by modeling in complex with specific agonist radioligands. Consensus binding modes map common pharmacophore features of several chemical series to specific binding interactions. These models provide a rationalization of how PAM binding slows agonist radioligand dissociation kinetics. M1R PAMs were predicted to bind in the analogous M2R PAM LY2119620 binding site. The M5R NAM (ML-375) was predicted to bind in the PAM (ML-380) binding site with a unique induced-fit receptor conformation. (c) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

H-1 and N-15 chemical shift variations indicated that free and bound peptide is in fast exchange in solutions containing 1 mM dynorphin and 0.01 mM KOR. Radioligand binding indicated an intermediate-affinity interaction, with a K-d of similar to 200 nM. Transferred nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy was used to determine the structure of bound dynorphin. The N-terminal opioid signature, YGGF, was observed to be flexibly disordered, the central part of the peptide from L5 to R9 to form a helical turn, and the C-terminal segment from P10 to K13 to be flexibly disordered in this intermediate-affinity bound state. Combining molecular modeling with NMR provided an initial framework for understanding multistep activation of a G protein-coupled receptor by its cognate peptide ligand.

Affinity towards the dopamine D-1-like and D-2-like, and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors was evaluated using the radioligand binding assays. All compounds tested had affinity for the D-2-like and 5-HT1A receptors, but were inactive towards the D-1-like receptor. Halogenated 6-[2-(4-arylpiperazin-1-yl)ethyl]-1H-benzimidazoles showed higher affinity compared to their nonhalogenated congeners. In silico docking analysis of selected ligands was performed in order to explain the results of binding assays. Our analysis suggests that stabilizing interactions between the halogen atom at the benzimidazole ring and the Ser-122 of the D-2-like and Trp-358 of the 5-HT1A receptor. Energy contributions for these interactions were calculated using the ab initio method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

TS-951 potently inhibited specific [H-3]GR113808 binding both in guinea-pig striatum and in mouse brain. The affinity of TS-951 for the 5-HT4 receptor was higher than those of other agonists, 5-HT, cisapride, mosapride and renzapride, On the longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig ileum, TS-951 caused a concentration-dependent increase in the amplitude of electrically induced submaximal twitch contractions. On the longitudinal muscle of the guinea-pig distal colon, TS-951 also caused concentration-dependent contractions. TS-951 is a high-affinity, selective and potent 5-HT4 receptor agonist. This compound therefore can be considered as a useful pharmacological tool for investigating 5-HT4 receptor-mediated events. Copyright (C) 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

An eight-arm radial maze was used to evaluate spatial memory. The performance of the eight-arm radial maze task was impaired in beta -amyloid protein-treated rats. in the parietal cortex, [H-3]-vesamicol binding to the vesicular acetylcholine transporter was significantly lower in beta -amyloid protein-treated rats than in vehicle-treated rats, and was significantly correlated with the mean number of correct selections in the maze task of the first 5 days in the post-operative state. These results indicate that the reduction in [H-3]-vesamicol binding to vesicular acetylcholine transporter is related to memory impairment induced by beta -amyloid protein. beta -Amyloid protein-infused rats with spatial memory impairment may be useful for the development of new radiolabelled vesamicol analogues for the objective evaluation of Alzheimer's disease.

These data further confirm the presence of peripheral biochemical alterations in migraine without aura. As peripheral benzodiazepine receptors appear to be involved in the regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, the observed increase in B-max might be related to the mitochondrial anomalies found in migraine disorders.

Methods Thirteen migraineurs with aura and 16 healthy controls received integrated PET/MRI brain scans with [C-11] PBR28, a radioligand that binds to the 18 kDa translocator protein, a marker of glial activation. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) was compared between groups, and regressed against clinical variables, using region of interest and whole-brain voxelwise analyses. Results Compared to healthy controls, migraineurs demonstrated SUVR elevations in nociceptive processing areas (e.g., thalamus and primary/secondary somatosensory and insular cortices) as well as in areas previously shown to be involved in CSD generation (visual cortex). SUVR levels in frontoinsular cortex, primary/secondary somatosensory cortices, and basal ganglia were correlated with frequency of migraine attacks. Conclusions These findings demonstrate that migraine with aura is associated with neuroimmune activation/neuroinflammation, and support a possible link between CSD and glial activation, previously observed in animals.

The aim of this study is to identify novel anticancer strategies from existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs that have been used to clinically treat other diseases. Here, propafenone, an antiarrhythmic medication, was found to induce apoptosis and exert a significantly inhibitory effect on the proliferation and colony-forming ability of ESCC cells in a dose-dependent manner without observed cytotoxicity on normal esophageal epithelial cells. Furthermore, propafenone markedly suppressed growth of tumor xenografts in nude mice by reducing the Ki-67 proliferation index and angiogenesis but did not damage the vital organs of the animals. Mechanistically, our data from the proteomics, Western blot and flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that propafenone caused mitochondrial dysfunction as indicated by a decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced expression of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. In summary, this study provides the first evidence that propafenone, an FDA-approved drug to treat arrhythmias, could be a novel therapeutic strategy for treating ESCC without obvious side effects.

Especially, in natural environment or in vivo, some receptors including muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) are frequently modified by many factors, so that the receptors may exhibit multiple pharmacological profiles and biochemical functions, which are different from relatively constant and uniform properties originally reported in cell-free preparations and recombinant system. In order to detect the native properties of receptors occurring in tissues and cells without altering their natural environment and also to solve discrepancy between the functional affinity obtained by a bioassay approach and the binding affinity estimated from the conventional binding method with membrane preparations, the tissue segment binding method without homogenization has been recently developed as a new approach. In this chapter, the detailed protocol of tissue segment binding method and some unique properties of mAChRs observed in tissue segments are described.

Truncated Nucleosides as A<sub>3</sub> Adenosine Receptor Ligands: Combined 2-Arylethynyl and Bicyclohexane Substitutions	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						G protein coupled receptor; purines; molecular modeling; structure-activity relationship; radioligand binding; adenosine receptor	A3 RECEPTOR; DERIVATIVES; RIBOSE; POTENT	C2-Arylethynyladenosine-5'-N-methyluronamides containing a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane [(N)-methanocarba] ring are selective A(3) adenosine receptor (AR) agonists. Similar 4'-truncated C2-arylethynyl-(N)-methanocarba nucleosides containing alkyl or alkylaryl groups at the N-6 position were low-efficacy agonists or antagonists of the human A(3)AR with high selectivity. Higher hA(3)AR affinity was associated with N-6-methyl and ethyl (K-i = 3-6 nM) than with N-6-arylallcyl groups. However, combined C2-phenylethynyl and N-6-2-phenylethyl substitutions in selective antagonist 15 provided a K-i of 20 nM. Differences between 4'-truncated and nontruncated analogues of extended C2-p-biphenylethynyl substitution suggested a ligand reorientation in AR binding, dominated by bulky N-6 groups in analogues lacking a stabilizing S'-uronamide moiety. Thus, 4'-truncation of C2-arylethynyl-(N)-methanocarba adenosine derivatives is compatible with general preservation of A(3)AR selectivity, especially with small N-6 groups, but reduced efficacy in A(3)AR-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase.

The effective atomic polarizability, alpha(d), has a fundamental influence on chemical reactivity in the gas phase and in solution. In terms of chemical reactivity the charge is generated within the molecule as a positive charge due to protonation, ionization or resulting from the attack of a nucleophilic anion. In this paper, lipoidal diaminedithiol (DADT) perfusion radioligands based on Tc-99(m), and possessing an alkylamine side chain have been used to check the influence of alpha(d) on their brain uptake. Some new DADT derivatives, respectively DADT-DIPA (diaminedithiol-diisopropylamine), DADT DIBA (diaminedithiol-diisobutylamine), DADT-PR (diaminedithiol-branched pyperidine), have been designed to have high nitrogen alkylamine alpha(d) values. In spite of the fact of higher alpha(d) values having been correlated to higher brain uptakes, there isn't a clear mechanism able to trap these radioligands into the brain space.

Using a simple folate-BSA conjugate adsorbed onto a Au-coated quartz sensor, a detection limit of 30 nM was achieved. Binding of FBP to the sensor surface could be blocked at concentrations as high as 1 mu M with a 100-fold excess of folic acid, indicating the specificity of the folate-FBP interaction and the absence of nonspecific binding to the functionalized surface. Moreover, capture could be achieved in the presence of blood serum, making the assay amenable to the analysis of bodily fluids. Further signal enhancement based on an anti-FBP antibody and protein-A-coated gold nanosphere sandwich assay extended the detection limit to 50 pM ( similar to 3 orders-of-magnitude improvement). Given the overexpression of FBP in certain malignancies and inflammatory disorders, we expect the methodology described here to be useful to detect FBP as a possible biomarker for disease diagnosis.

The adenine-based compounds were substituted in 2- or 8-position with a variety of side chains including some aryl or arylalkynyl groups previously tested as 2-substituents in adenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) for their effect on agonist affinity. The affinity of the novel compounds was tested in radioligand binding assays (A(1), A(2A) and A(3)) and inhibition of NECA-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (A(2B)) in membranes prepared from CHO cells stably transfected with the respective human receptor subtype. High affinity antagonists were identified for A(1) (9-ethyl-8-phenyl-9H-adenine, compound 2; 6-(1-butylamino)-9-ethyl-8-phenyl-9H-purine, compound 3), A(2A) (8-ethoxy-9-ethyladenine; compound 8) and A(3) (9-ethyl-8-phenylethynyl-9H-adenine, compound 5) with selectivities versus other receptor subtypes in the range of 10 to 600. These results demonstrate that adenine is a useful template for further development of high-affinity antagonists with distinct receptor selectivity profiles.

GABA(B1) was retained within the endoplasmic reticulum and failed to couple to signal transduction pathways on stimulation with agonists. In radioligand binding experiments it was found that although the affinity of antagonists showed a close agreement between rat brain membranes and membranes expressing the cloned receptor, agonist ligands were significantly weaker at recombinant receptors. Using the C-terminal tail as bait, a yeast two-hybrid screen was run against a human brain cDNA library and identified a second receptor, GABA(B2), as a major interacting protein, This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation as well as extensive colocalization studies. Coexpression of the two seven-transmembrane proteins generated a fully functional receptor, which was expressed at the cell surface confirming the importance of receptor heterodimerization for GABA(B) receptor activity.

Albumin-Binding PSMA Ligands: Implications for Expanding the Therapeutic Window	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PSMA; radioligand therapy; albumin binding; pharmacokinetics	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; PROSTATE-CANCER; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; BIODISTRIBUTION; PHARMACOKINETICS; INHIBITORS; J591	Despite significant gains in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer by radioligands targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), 30% of patients never respond to therapy. One possible explanation is insufficient dose delivery to the tumor because of suboptimal pharmacokinetics. We have recently described RPS-063, a trifunctional ligand targeting PSMA with high uptake in LNCaP xenograft tumors but also in kidneys. We aimed to use structural modifications to increase the tumor-to-kidney ratio through increased albumin binding and tumor uptake and reduction of kidney activity. Methods: Four structurally related trifunctional PSMA-targeting small molecules were prepared by either varying the albumin-binding group or inserting a polyethylene glycol 8 linker into a common structure. The compounds were ranked by PSMA affinity and albumin affinity and were radiolabeled with Ga-68 and Lu-177. Tissue kinetics were determined in male BALB/C nu/nu mice bearing LNCaP xenograft tumors. Results: Each of the compounds binds PSMA with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of no more than 10 nM. The albumin-binding group had a minimal effect on PSMA affinity but changed albumin affinity by an order of magnitude. However, the addition of a polyethylene glycol 8 spacer weakened affinity for albumin in each case. Increased affinity for albumin corresponded with delayed blood clearance and modified uptake kinetics in the tumor and kidney. Uptake of Lu-177-RPS-072 (34.9 +/- 2.4 % ID/g) and Lu-177-RPS-077 (27.4 +/- 0.6 % ID/g) increased up to 24 h after injection, and washout by 96 h was not significant. As a result, the area under the curve (AUC) in the tumor was in the following order: Lu-177-RPS-072. Lu-177-RPS-077. Lu-177-RPS-063. Lu-177-RPS-071. Increased linker length corresponded to more rapid clearance from kidneys. Consequently, the ratio of tumor AUC and kidney AUC was 4.7 +/- 0.3 for Lu-177-RPS-072. Conclusion: The tumor AUC and tumor-to-kidney ratio of Lu-177-RPS-072 are significantly enhanced compared with any small molecule investigated in a LNCaP xenograft model to date. In comparison to other PSMAtargeting radioligands that have been evaluated in a PC3-PIP model, activity in kidneys is reduced and activity in tumors compares favorably when the different PSMA expression levels in LNCaP and PC3-PIP cells are considered. RPS-072 therefore exhibits an increased therapeutic index, shows the potential to increase the dose delivered to tumors, and is a highly promising candidate for targeted radioligand therapy.

In this study, we performed preclinical and first clinical PET studies using [C-11]CHIBA-1001 for imaging alpha 7 nAChRs in the human brain. [C-11]CHIBA-1001 was synthesized by methylation of the tributylstannyl precursor with [C-11]CH3I in a palladium-promoted Stille cross-coupling reaction. The radiation absorbed-dose of [C-11]CHIBA-1001 in humans was calculated from distribution data in mice. The acute toxicity of CHIBA-1001 at a dose of 3.20 mg/kg body weight, which is more than 41,000-fold the clinical equivalent dose of [C-11]CHIBA-1001, was evaluated. The mutagenicity of CHIBA-1001 was studied by a reverse mutation test in Salmonella typhimurium (Ames test). Metabolite analysis in the mouse brain was carried out by high-performance liquid chromatography. The first clinical PET imaging of alpha 7 nAChRs with [C-11]CHIBA-1001 in a normal volunteer was also performed. A suitable preparation method for [C-11]CHIBA-1001 injection was established. The radiation absorbed-dose by [C-11]CHIBA-1001 in humans was low enough for clinical use, and no acute toxicity or mutagenicity of CHIBA-1001 was found. Most radioactivity in the mouse brain was detected as an unchanged form, although peripherally [C-11]CHIBA-1001 was degraded. We successfully performed brain imaging by PET with [C-11]CHIBA-1001 in a normal volunteer. A 90-min dynamic scan showed a rapid accumulation and gradual washout of radioactivity in the brain. The highest distribution volume of [C-11]CHIBA-1001 was found in the thalamus; however, regional differences in brain radioactivity were small. Peripherally, [C-11]CHIBA-1001 was stable in humans: > 80% of the radioactivity in plasma was detected as the unchanged form for 60 min. These results demonstrate that [C-11]CHIBA-1001 is a suitable radioligand to use in clinical trials for imaging alpha 7 nAChRs in the human brain, providing acceptable dosimetry and pharmacological safety at the dose required for adequate PET imaging.

Nine men (mean age 33 years, range 34-74 years) were prospectively included. For safety measurements, vital signs were recorded and serum chemical analysis carried out, with a complete blood cell count and urine analysis, and an ECG was performed prior to injection of Tc-99(m)-HL91 and repeated during the investigation. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans of the head and neck, and of a standard, were performed at 2 h and 4 h post-injection of 740 MBq Tc-99(m)-HL91. Tumour-to-normal tissue background (T/N) ratios and percentage uptake were measured for ail Tc-99(m)-HL91 scans. Spiral CT scans were obtained using a Somaton 4+ Siemens scanner within 1 week from the Tc-99(m)-HL91 scans. Based on CT and the Tc-99(m)-HL91 scan findings guided biopsies were performed. No adverse or subjective side effects were noticed. Vital signs, ECG findings, clinical laboratory, blood and urine assays remained stable in all patients. Spiral CT suggested local recurrence in 5/9 patients accompanied by nodal involvement in three, all of which proved positive on biopsy. Tc-99(m)-HL91 scintigraphy was false positive in one patient and true positive (TP) in 3/5 local recurrences and two out of three sites of lymph node involvement depicted by spiral CT. The mean T/N ratios at 2 h and 4 h in TPs were 1.28 (range 1.1-1.66) and 1.40 (range 1.0-1.6), respectively. The corresponding absolute percentages of Tc-99(m)-HL91 lesional uptake at 2 h and 4 h were mu =0.05% (SD = 0.03%) and mu = 0.048% (SD = 0.035%). The findings suggest Tc-99(m)-HL91 is a safe radioligand and that metabolic binding in a large fraction but not all of local SCCHN recurrences may be expected. The inference that tumour Tc-99(m)-HL91 avidity could be a non-invasive measure of tumour hypoxia deserves however independent confirmation with needle oximetry.

The current study aimed to determine the external radiation dose received by staff who, using or not using a lead shield, treat patients with Lu-177-prostate-specific membrane antigen therapy. Methods: This study used a personal thermo-luminescent digital survey meter to measure dose rates to staff at various distances from patients and determined the average time spent by staff at these distances. The deep-dose equivalent to staff was obtained. Results: The measured deep-dose equivalent to staff per patient was within the range of 1.8-5.2 mSv using a 2-mm lead shield and 3.3-8.1 mSv not using the shield. The shield markedly reduced the external dose to staff. Conclusion: The skill and accuracy of staff, and the speed with which they act, can directly affect their received dose.

Herein, we extended the structure-activity relationships of EC21a through structural modifications regarding the p-fluoro benzyl moiety at position 1 and the amide group in position 3 of the central core. The characterization in vitro was assessed through radioligand binding experiments and functional assays (GTP gamma S, cAMP, beta arrestin2). Among the new compounds, the derivatives A1 (SV-10a) and A5 (SB-13a) characterized respectively by fluorine atom or by chlorine atom in ortho position of the benzylic group at position 1 and by a cycloheptane-carboxamide at position 3 of the central core, showed positive allosteric behavior on CB2R. They enhanced the efficacy of CP55,940 in [S-35]GTP gamma S assay, and modulated CP55,940-dependent barrestin2 recruitment and cAMP inhibition. The obtained results extend our knowledge of the structural requirements for interaction with the allosteric site of CB2R. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The lead compound (1S,5R)-1 ((4-(1H-indo1-3-y1)-3-methoxyphenyl) ((1S,5R)-1,3,3trimethy1-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-6-yemethanone) and its F-ethyl analog 6c exhibited the best combination of high binding affinity and optimal lipophilicity within the series. (1.5,5R)-1 was radiolabeled with C-11 for PET studies. [(CH3)-C-11](1S,5R)-1 readily entered the mouse (4.7%113/g tissue) and prairie vole brains (similar to 2% ID/g tissue) and specifically (30-34%) labeled Via receptor. The common animal anesthetic Propofol significantly blocked the brain uptake of [(CH3)-C-11](1S,5R)-1 in the mouse brain, whereas anesthetics Ketamine and Saffan increased the uptake variability. Future PET imaging studies with Via radiotracers in non-human primates should be performed in awake animals or using anesthetics that do not affect the V-1a receptor.

Procedures: [F-18]Mefway was applied to rats pharmacologically inhibited with tariquidar (TQD) and to genetically disrupted mice. Results: Pretreatment of TQD results in 160 % higher hippocampal uptake compared with control rats. In genetically disrupted mice, a maximal brain uptake value of 3.2 SUV in the triple knockout mice (tKO, Mdr1a/b((-/-))Bcrp1((-/-))) was comparable to that of the double knockout mice (dKO, Mdr1a/b((-/-))) and 2-fold those of the wild-type and Bcrp1((-/-)) knockout mice. The differences of binding values were statistically insignificant between control and experimental groups. The brain-to-plasma ratios for tKO mice were also two to five times higher than those for other groups. Conclusions: [F-18]Mefway is modulated by P-gp, and not by Bcrp in rodents.

We synthesized diazaheterocyclics from reduced tripeptides. In vitro screening with radioligand competition binding assays demonstrated variable affinity for mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and kappa (KOR) opioid receptors across the series, with the diimidazodiazepine 14 (2065-14) displaying good affinity for DOR and KOR. Central (icy), intraperitoneal (ip), or oral (po) administration of 14 produced dose-dependent, opioid-receptor mediated antinociception in the mouse, as determined from a 55 degrees C warm-water tail-withdrawal assay. Only trace amounts of compound 14 was found in brain up to 90 min later, suggesting poor BBB penetration and possible peripherally restricted activity. Central administration of 14 did not produce locomotor effects, acute antinociceptive tolerance, or conditioned-place preference or aversion. The data suggest these diazaheterocyclic mixed activity opioid receptor agonists may hold potential as new analgesics with fewer liabilities of use.

They were tested at sigma(1), sigma(2), and sterol Delta(8)-Delta(7) isomerase (SI) sites by in vitro radioligand binding assays, to evaluate the influence of a chiral center in the alkyl chain on the selective a, binding relative to other a family sites. Generally high alpha(1)-site affinities were found, so that the chirality introduced by a methyl substitution resulted in slight differences. Nevertheless, the shorter oxyethylenic chain was beneficial to increase a, selectivity. However, the (-)-(S)-4-methyl-1-[2-(4-chlorophenoxy)1-methylethyl]piperidine ((-)-(S)-17) reached the highest sigma(1) affinity (K-i = 0.34 nM) and the best selectivity relative to the sigma(2) site (547-fold).

In this study, we performed pharmacological comparison of the rat and human melancortin (MC) 3 and MC4 receptors. We transiently expressed the genes for these receptors individually in a mammalian cell line and determined the binding affinities to several MSH peptides. The results showed no major difference between the rat and human MC3 receptors while the rat MC4 receptor had higher affinity to several peptides compared with the human MC4 receptor. NDP-, alpha-, beta-, gamma-MSH, ACTH(1-24), HS014 and MTII had from 5- to 34-fold higher affinity for the rat MC4 receptor, while SHU9119, HS024 and HS028 had similar affinity for both the MC4 receptors. pharmacological species difference have earlier been reported for the MC1 and MC5 receptors but this is the first report showing important differences between the rat and human MC4 receptors.

On the other hand, the binding of the nonpeptide AT(1) receptor-selective antagonist [H-3]candesartan is not affected but competition binding curves of angiotensin II and the peptide antagonist [Sar(1),Ile(8)]angiotensin II (sarile) are shifted to the right. These effects resulted from the breakdown of angiotensin II into smaller fragments that do not bind to the AT(1) receptor. In this context, angiotensin-(1-7) is the most prominent fragment and angiotensin-(1-4) and angiotensin-(1-5) are also formed but to a lesser extent. The molecular weight of the involved peptidases exceeds 50 kDa, as determined by gel chromatography and ultrafitration. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, the morpholinoethyl of WIN 55,212-2 was replaced with carbon chains of varying lengths ranging from a methyl to heptyl group. Additional groups were added to the naphthoyl and the C2 positions of the molecule. These structural changes revealed that high affinity binding to the CB1 and CB2 receptors requires an alkyl chain length of at least three carbons with optimum binding to both receptors occurring with a five carbon side chain. An alkyl chain of 3-6 carbons is sufficient for high affinity binding; however, extension of the chain to a heptyl group results in a dramatic decrease in binding at both receptors. The unique structure of the cannabimimetic indoles provides a useful tool to define the ligand-receptor interaction at both cannabinoid receptors and to refine proposed pharmacophore models.

This nucleus could be considered a versatile scaffold. The physicochemical properties of benzomorphan N-substituent are crucial in achieving a definite pharmacological profile at opioid receptors. Thus, the dual-target MOR/DOR ligands LP1 and LP2 were obtained through N-substituent modifications. Specifically, LP2, bearing as N-substituent the (2R/S)-2-methoxy-2- phenylethyl group, is a dual-target MOR/DOR agonist and is successful in animal models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain. To obtain new opioid ligands, we focused on the design and synthesis of LP2 analogs. First, the 2-methoxyl group of LP2 was replaced by an ester or acid functional group. Then, spacers of different lengths were introduced at N-substituent. In-vitro, their affinity profile versus opioid receptors has been performed through competition binding assays. Molecular modeling studies were conducted to deeply analyze the binding mode and the interactions between the new ligands and all opioid receptors.

Here, we report the cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of Ca(v)1.1 in complex with archetypal antagonistic drugs, nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil, at resolutions of 2.9 angstrom, 3.0 angstrom, and 2.7 angstrom, respectively, and with a DHP agonist Bay K 8644 at 2.8 angstrom. Diltiazem and verapamil traverse the central cavity of the pore domain, directly blocking ion permeation. Although nifedipine and Bay K 8644 occupy the same fenestration site at the interface of repeats III and IV, the coordination details support previous functional observations that Bay K 8644 is less favored in the inactivated state. These structures elucidate the modes of action of different Ca-v ligands and establish a framework for structure-guided drug discovery.

According to current industry standards, in vitro testing for susceptibility to OATP1B1 and 1B3 mediated transport is recommended for drug candidates that are eliminated in part via the liver. Here we show that human OATP1B1, 1B3 and 2B1 transport a series of commercially available viability dyes that are generally believed to be impermeable to intact cells. We demonstrate that the intracellular accumulation of Zombie Violet, Live/Dead Green, Cascade Blue and Alexa Fluor 405 is specifically increased by OATPs. Inhibition of Cascade Blue or Alexa Fluor 405 uptake by known OATP substrates/inhibitors yielded IC50 values in agreement with gold-standard radioligand assays. The fluorescence-based assays described in this study provide a new tool for testing OATP1B/2B1 drug interactions.

Structures of Human A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2A</sub> Adenosine Receptors with Xanthines Reveal Determinants of Selectivity	STRUCTURE			English	Article							2ND EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; HIGH-AFFINITY ANTAGONIST; SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; AGONIST; BINDING; LIGANDS; A(1)-ADENOSINE; RADIOLIGAND; FEATURES	The adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors belong to the purinergic family of G protein-coupled receptors, and regulate diverse functions of the cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, inflammation, and CNS. Xanthines such as caffeine and theophylline are weak, nonselective antagonists of adenosine receptors. Here we report the structure of a thermostabilized human A(1) receptor at 3.3 angstrom resolution with PSB36, an A(1)-selective xanthine-based antagonist. This is compared with structures of the A(2A) receptor with PSB36 (2.8 angstrom resolution), caffeine (2.1 angstrom), and theophylline (2.0 angstrom) to highlight features of ligand recognition which are common across xanthines. The structures of A(1)R and A(2A)R were analyzed to identify the differences that are important selectivity determinants for xanthine ligands, and the role of T270(7.35) in A(1)R (M270(7.35) in A(2A)R) in conferring selectivity was confirmed by mutagenesis. The structural differences confirmed to lead to selectivity can be utilized in the design of new subtype-selective A(1)R or A(2A)R antagonists.	[Cheng, Robert K.

These compounds were found to possess potent in vitro binding affinities (K-1: 8.0-34.1 nM) for mGluR2 in rat brain homogenate. [C-11]1, [C-11] 2, and [F-18]4 were synthesized by [C-11/F-18]alkylation of the corresponding phenol precursors with [C-11] methyl iodide or [F-18]fluoroethyl bromide with >98% radiochemical purity and 80-130 GBq/mu mol specific activity at the end of synthesis. In vitro autoradiography indicated that these radiotracers showed heterogeneous specific bindings in mGluR2-rich brain regions, such as the cerebral cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and granular layer of the cerebellum.

N-[4-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidin-1-yl]-N'-(2-oxo-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-5-yl)oxamide has been described demonstrating high affinity and selectivity for the NR2B receptors (IC50 of 5nM in [H-3]Ro-25,6981 binding assay). The labelling precursor and the reference compound were synthesized by coupling the 4-(4-fluorobenzyl)piperidine with the corresponding oxalamic acid. The reaction of [C-11]phosgene with phenylenediamine precursor led the formation of the [C-11]benzimidazolone ring present on the ligand. The labelling occurred in THF or acetonitrile and the decay corrected radiochemical yield was 30-40% from the produced [C-11]methane. HPLC purification and formulation led to 2.6-3.7 GBq (70-100mCi) of radioligand within 30-35 min. The specific radioactivity was 72-127 GBq/mu mol (2-3.4 Ci/mu mol) at the end of synthesis.

Since drug binding data are currently fitted using equations developed for monomeric receptors, the interpretation of the pharmacological data are equivocal in many cases. As reported here, GPCR dimer models account for changes in competition curve shape as a function of the radioligand concentration used, something that cannot be explained by monomeric receptor models. Macroscopic equilibrium dissociation constants for the agonist and homotropic cooperativity index reflecting the intramolecular communication within the dopamine D-1 or adenosine A(2A) receptor homodimer as well as hybrid equilibrium dissociation constant, which reflects the antagonist/agonist modulation may be calculated by fitting binding data from antagonist/agonist competition experiments to equations developed from dimer receptor models. Comparing fitting the data by assuming a classical monomeric receptor model or a dimer model, it is shown that dimer receptor models provide more clues useful in drug discovery than monomer-based models.

Atropine, scopolamine, physostigmine, and tacrine combine potentiation of ion current induced by low concentrations of acetylcholine with inhibition of ion current evoked by high concentrations of acetylcholine. Rivastigmine, galanthamine, and dichlorvos cause only inhibition of ion current evoked by low concentrations of acetylcholine. Binding experiments show that the potentiating cholinergic drugs atropine, scopolamine, and physostigmine are competitive ligands of human alpha4beta2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Conversely, the inhibitory cholinergic drugs galanthamine and rivastigmine are non-competitive. The noncompetitive drugs are not allosteric, since they do not affect the saturation curve of the radioligand [H-3]cytisine. Effects of potentiating cholinergic drugs on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are consistent with and predicted by a model comprising competitive drug effects at two equivalent agonist recognition sites on the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor combined with non-competitive ion channel block.

The results of this structure-activity relationship study identified one compound, 15, that bound with high affinity (K-i value = 2 nM) and moderate selectivity (30-fold) for D-3 compared to D-2 receptors. In addition, this series of compounds were also tested for affinity at sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors. We evaluated the affinity of these dopaminergic compounds at sigma receptors because (a) several antipsychotic drugs, which are high affinity antagonists at dopamine D2-like receptors, also bind to sigma receptors and (b) sigma receptors are expressed ubiquitously and at high levels (picomoles per mg proteins). It was observed that a number of analogues displayed high affinity and excellent selectivity for sigma(2) versus sigma(1) receptors. Consequently, these novel compounds may be useful for characterizing the functional role of sigma(2) receptors and for imaging the sigma(2) receptor status of tumors in vivo with PET.

In order to efficiently distinguish lymphocytic hypophysitis and pituitary tumors, we studied the presence of autoantibodies against prohormone-processing enzymes, prohormone convertase (PC) 1/3, PC2, carboxypeptidase E (CPE), and PC2 regulatory protein, 702, by radioligand assay using recombinant human S-35-labeled protein in patients with clinically nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma, lymphocytic hypophysitis, and other pituitary diseases. The indexes for anti-PC1/3 antibodies (Ab) were significantly higher in patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma than in patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis. Patients positive for either anti-PC1/3 or anti-7B2 Ab were significantly frequent among patients with nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma than in other pituitary diseases and healthy controls. None of the patients was positive for anti-PC2 Ab or anti-CPE Ab. These results suggest that autoantibodies against PC1/3 and 7B2 are novel tumor-associated autoantibodies and can be helpful in the diagnosis of clinically nonfunctioning pituitary macroadenoma.

Of several mGluR agonists tested, group I agonists were more potent in displacing [H-3]QA binding than group II and group III agonists in the presence of the three ionotropic agonists. [H-3]QA binding was markedly inhibited by guanine nucleotide analogues in a concentration-dependent manner at a concentration range of 10 nM to 1 mM. Scatchard analysis revealed that [H-3]QA binding consisted of a single component with a K-d of 50.9+/-5.3 nM and a B-max of 431.6+/-18.3 fmol/mg protein. These results suggest that [H-3]QA indeed labels group I mGluR functionally coupled to GTP binding protein in rat brain synaptic membranes when determined under the experimental conditions employed.

In vitro receptor binding and functional assays demon-strated a wide series of activities related to the CB1 receptors (CB1Rs). Compound 34 showed a high CB1R binding affinity (Ki = 6.9 nM) and agonist activity (EC50 = 46 nM; Emax = 135%). Radioligand binding and [35S]GTP gamma S binding assays also demonstrated its selectivity and specificity to CB1Rs. Moreover, in vivo experiments revealed that 34 was slightly more effective than the CB1 agonist WIN55,212-2 in the early phase of the formalin test, indicating a short duration of the analgesic effect. Interestingly, in a mouse model of zymosan-induced hindlimb edema, 34 was able to maintain the percentage of paw volume below 75% for 24 h following subcutaneous injection. After intraperitoneal administration, 34 increased the food intake of mice, suggesting potential activity on CB1Rs.

In this study, we present the first direct comparison of BRET-based and FA-based binding assays using the human M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2R) and two TAMRA (5-carboxytetramethylrhodamine)-labeled fluorescent ligands as a model system. The determined fluorescent ligand affinities from both assays were in good agreement with results obtained from radioligand competition binding experiments. The assays yielded real-time kinetic binding data revealing differences in the mechanism of binding for the investigated fluorescent probes. Furthermore, the investigation of various unlabeled M2R ligands yielded pharmacological profiles in accordance with earlier reported data. Taken together, this study showed that BRET- and FA-based binding assays represent valuable alternatives to radioactivity-based methods for screening purposes and for a precise characterization of binding kinetics supporting the exploration of binding mechanisms.

In this article, we present the establishment of a homogeneous live cell-based BRET binding assay for the histamine H-2 receptor with different fluorescently labeled squaramide-type compounds synthesized in the course of this study. Py-1-labeled ligand 8 (UR-KAT478) was found to be most suitable in BRET saturation binding experiments with respect to receptor affinity (pK(d) = 7.35) and signal intensity. Real-time kinetic experiments showed a full association of 8 within approximately 30 min and a slow dissociation of the ligand from the receptor. Investigation of reference compounds in BRET-based competition binding with 8 yielded pK(i) values in agreement with radioligand binding data. This study shows that the BRET binding assay is a versatile test system for the characterization of putative new ligands at the histamine H-2 receptor and represents a valuable fluorescence-based alternative to canonical binding assays.

In this work, new indazole ethers that possess dual activity as both cannabinoid agonists CB2 and inhibitors of BuChE have been designed by computational methods. On the basis of this knowledge, the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking studies of a new class of indazoles has been performed. Pharmacological evaluation includes radioligand binding assays with [H-3]-CP55940 for CB1R and CB2R and functional activity for cannabinoid receptors on isolated tissue. Additionally, in vitro inhibitory assays of AChE/BuChE and the corresponding competition studies have been carried out. The results of pharmacological tests have revealed that three of these derivatives behave as CB2 cannabinoid agonists and simultaneously show BuChE inhibition. In particular, compounds 3 and 24 have emerged as promising candidates as novel cannabinoids that inhibit BuChE by a non-competitive or mixed mechanism, respectively. On the other hand, both molecules show antioxidant properties. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Radioligand binding studies indicated high affinity to D-2-like receptors. The test compounds were evaluated for their ability to differentially activate distinct signaling pathways. Measurement of D-2L- and D-2S-mediated [S-35]GTP gamma S incorporation in the presence of coexpressed G alpha(o) and G alpha(i) subunits showed significantly biased receptor activation for several test compounds. Thus, the 2-azaindolylcarboxamide (S)-2a exhibited substantial functional selectivity for D-2S-promoted G(o) activation over G(i) coupling. The most significant bias was determined for the triazolylalkoxy-substituted benzamide (S)-2c that displayed higher potency for G(o) activation than for G, coupling at the D-2L subtype. Functional selectivity for beta-arrestin recruitment over G(i) activation was observed for the biphenylcarboxamide (R)-1 and the 2-benzothiophenylcarboxamide (S)-2d, whereas the 2-substituted azaindole (S)-2a preferred beta-arrestin recruitment compared to G(o) coupling.

It can be conjugated to a target molecule containing an amino functional group under weak basic conditions by way of thiourea bond formation. We explored the application of synthesized ligand by conjugating to well known alpha(v)beta(3) integrin targeting peptide, c(RGDyK). The conjugated peptide showed good radiochemical yield and efficiency with an excellent radiochemical purity (97.1 +/- 1.2%) in a short reaction time (10 min). Labeled peptide showed excellent in vitro and in vivo stability (>95%). alpha(v)beta(3) integrin specific tumor uptake was observed both in biodistribution and small animal microPET studies on alpha(v)beta(3)-positive U87MG (human glioma cells) xenograft bearing mice. In general, successful application of synthesized ligand for labeling of RGD peptide could facilitate the possibility of using this ligand for labeling peptides containing an amino functional group.

Affinities of these ligands for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors were investigated by means of radioligand binding assays, with the identification of N-(2-benzofuranylmethyl)-N'-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propyl] piperazine (29,K-i = 3.1 nM, sigma(2)/sigma(1) = 45) as a selective sigma(1) ligand. The sigma(1) affinities and subtype selectivities of piperazines 16-21 and 26-31 were generally comparable to the corresponding benzylic analogs. Additionally, the affinities of 16-21 and 26-31 for the 5-HT2B receptor were much lower than the relatively nonselective methoxybenzylic analogs 2-4, indicating that elongation of the alkyl tether generally improved selectivity for sigma(1) receptors.

EGF downregulated specific AngII radioligand binding in intact cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells but not in cell membranes and also inhibited AngII-stimulated contractions of aortic segments. Inhibitors of cAMP-dependent kinases, PI-3 kinase, MAP kinase, cyclooxygenase, and calmodulin did not prevent EGF-mediated downregulation of AngII receptor binding, whereas the EGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1478 did. Total cell AngII AT1a receptor protein content of EGF-treated and untreated cells, measured by immunoblotting, did not differ. Actinomycin D or cytochalasin D, which interacts with the cytoskeleton, but not the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, prevented EGF from downregulating AngII receptor binding. Consistently, EGF inhibited AngII-stimulated formation of inositol phosphates in the presence of cycloheximide but not in the presence of actinomycin D or cytochalasin D. In conclusion, EGF needs an intact signal transduction pathway to downregulate AngII surface receptor binding, possibly by altering cellular location of the receptors.

The ability of carvedilol to antagonize functional effects mediated through myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors has never been investigated. We tested the ability of carvedilol to antagonize the inotropic effect mediated by myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors compared to the antagonism of beta-adrenoceptors. Papillary muscles from rat heart left ventricle were mounted in an organ bath and concentration-response experiments for the inotropic effects of separate alpha(1)- and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation were performed in the absence and presence of carvedilol. Carvedilol antagonized myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors with an inhibition constant (K-i) of 11.0 +/- 3.0 nmol/l and the functional experiments were supported by radioligand-binding studies. Corresponding functional studies on the response to beta-adrenoceptor stimulation revealed a K-i of 1.2 +/- 0.35 nmol/l. Thus, carvedilol antagonizes the myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptors with a 9-fold lower potency than the beta-adrenoceptors. Antagonism of myocardial alpha(1)-adrenoceptor evoked effects may contribute to clinical effects of carvedilol. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Patients and Methods: We analyzed red cell methotrexate polyglutamate concentrations with a sensitive radioligand-binding assay in 80 patients enrolled in the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) trial 1922 for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methotrexate concentrations were measured 7 days after the last doses of intrathecal and oral routes, using patients as their own controls. Intrathecal methotrexate was given on an age-adjusted schedule. Data was normalized to the actual dose received per body surface area. Results: The mean red cell methotrexate concentration 7 days after the last of four weekly intrathecal doses of methotrexate was 178 pmol/mL red blood cells, which was significantly greater than the result 7 days after subsequent weekly oral methotrexate of 122 pmol/mL (P = 0.00001). Intrathecal dosing resulted in an average systemic exposure ratio of 1.7 to I compared with oral administration. Conclusion: Intrathecal methotrexate administration results in significantly greater systemic exposure than oral administration. Our data support the hypothesis that the systemic effect of intrathecal methotrexate affects ALL therapy.

We have radiolabelled this compound by catalytic tritiation of the N,N(Me)(2)-Dmt(3',5'-I-2)-Tic-OH precursor. The ligand labelled rat brain membranes with a K-d value of 0.42 nM and a B-max of 63.12 fmol/mg protein. The new tritiated ligand showed high affinity for the delta opioid receptor whereas its binding at mu and kappa opioid receptors was weak. N,N(Me)(2)-Dmt-Tic-OH was able to inhibit the agonist-stimulated binding of the non-hydrolysable GTP analogue [S-35]GTP gamma S, thus attenuating the activation of G proteins via opioid receptors. This simple opioid dipeptide in both normal and labelled form may serve as a useful tool to study delta opioid receptors in vitro and in vivo.

High grade neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is associated to poor prognosis and the therapeutic armamentarium is restricted to platinum-based chemotherapy. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging has recently emerged as a potential new standard for the staging of prostate cancer and PSMA-based radioligand therapy (RLT) as a therapeutic option in advanced metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). PSMA-based theranostic is not currently applied in the staging and treatment of NEPC since PSMA expression on neuroendocrine differentiated cells was shown to be lost. In this case series, we present 3 consecutive mCRPC patients with histologically proven high grade neuroendocrine differentiation who underwent PSMA-PET/CT and surprisingly showed high tracer uptake. This observation stimulates further research on the use of PSMA-based theranostic in the management of NEPC.

Today, low-molecular-weight Y4R ligands are lacking, in particular antagonists. We synthesized a series of peptidic NPY Y4R ligands, derived from the hexapeptide acetyl-Arg-Tyr-Arg-Leu-Arg-Tyr-NH2 (1), reported to be a Y4R partial agonist with high affinity (pK(i) Y4R: 8.43). Peptide 1 was N-terminally extended as well as truncated and subjected to a d-amino acid scan, and Leu was replaced by different amino acids. Compounds were characterized by radioligand competition binding and functional studies (Ca-i(2+) mobilization and beta-arrestin 1/2 recruitment). N-terminal truncation of 1 resulted in a tetrapeptide (Arg-Leu-Arg-Tyr-NH2), being a Y4R partial agonist with unchanged Y4R affinity (pK(i): 8.47). Remarkably, replacement of Leu in 1 and in derivatives of 1 by Trp turned Y4R agonism to antagonism, giving Y4R antagonists with pK(i) values <= 7.57.

Their in vitro binding potencies were determined using [P-32]S1P competitive binding assays. Compounds 10a, 17a, 17b, and 24 exhibited high S1PR1 binding potencies with IC50 values ranging from 3.9 to 15.4 nM and also displayed high selectivity for S1PR1 over other S1P receptor subtypes (IC50 > 1000 nM for S1PR2-5). The most potent compounds 10a, 17a, 17b, and 24 were subsequently radiolabeled with F-18 in high yields and purities. MicroPET studies in cynomolgus macaque showed that [F-18]10a, [F-18]17a, and [F-18]17b but not [F-18]24 crossed the blood brain barrier and had high initial brain uptake. Further validation of [F-18]10a, [F-18]17a, and [F-18]17b in preclinical models of neuro-inflammation is warranted to identify a suitable PET radioligand to quantify S1PR1 expression in vivo as a metric of an inflammatory response.

Fluorescent-Labeled Selective Adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> Receptor Antagonist Enables Competition Binding Assay by Flow Cytometry	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RAT STRIATAL MEMBRANES; SINGLE LIVING CELLS; A(2A) RECEPTOR; SPECTROSCOPIC PROPERTIES; BODIPY DERIVATIVES; AGONIST BINDING; GPCR LIGANDS; PROBES; XANTHINES; RADIOLIGAND	Fluorescent ligands represent powerful tools for biological studies and are considered attractive alternatives to radioligands. In this study, we developed fluorescent antagonists for A(2B) adenosine receptors (A(2B)ARs), which are targeted by antiasthmatic xanthines and were proposed as novel targets in immuno-oncology. Our approach was to merge a small borondipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivative with the pharmacophore of 8-substituted xanthine derivatives. On the basis of the design, synthesis, and evaluation of model compounds, several fluorescent ligands were synthesized. Compound 29 (PO 12105), which displayed high affinity for human, rat, and mouse A(2B)ARs (K-i = 0.2-2 nM) and high selectivity for this AR subtype, was selected for further studies. A homology model of the human A(2B)AR was generated, and docking studies were performed. Moreover, 29 allowed us to establish a homogeneous receptor ligand binding assay using flow cytometry. These compounds constitute the first potent, selective fluorescent A(2B)AR ligands and are anticipated to be useful for a variety of applications.

In experiments in vitro, FPYBF-1 displayed high affinity for A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i = 0.9 nM), and substantial labeling of beta-amyloid plaques in sections of postmortem AD brains but not control brains. In experiments in vivo, [F-18]FPYBF-1 displayed good initial uptake (5.16%ID/g at 2 min postinjection) and rapid washout from the brain (2.44%ID/g at 60 min postinjection) in normal mice, and excellent binding to beta-amyloid plaques in a murine model of AD. Furthermore, the specific labeling of plaques labeling was observed in autoradiographs of autopsied AD brain sections. [F-18] FPYBF-1 may be a useful probe for imaging beta-amyloid plaques in living brain tissue. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Binding experiments were performed by using the NPFF2 selective radioligand [H-3]-EYF in membranes from CHO cells transfected with mouse and human NPFF2 receptors and compared to membranes from mouse olfactory bulb, the brain region expressing the highest density of NPFF2 receptors in mouse. mNPFF(2) receptors exhibited a high affinity (Kd = 0.2-0.4 nM) for [H-3]-EYF, comparable to that of hNPFF(2). receptors. Also, the binding selectivity profile of mNPFF(2) receptors was comparable to that of hNPFF(2) receptors, except for three ligands (NPSF, NPVF, RF9) that were about tenfold more potent and active on mouse receptors than on human receptors. In particular, compared to hNPFF(2) receptors, mNPFF(2) receptors were less discriminative towards the proNPFF(B)-derived peptide. This suggests some species-related differences in the binding properties of NPFF2 receptors that could have repercussion when evaluating the pharmacological properties of drugs in vivo.

Specific binding reaches equilibrium quickly and is saturable with a K-d value of 0.66 nM. The affinities of the several cholinergic agents were determined, including nicotine (K-i, 0.5 muM), cytisine (K-i, 0.5 muM), carbachol (K-i, 4.1 muM), dihydro-(beta)-erythroidine (K-i, 43.5 muM), d-tubocurarine (K-i, 0.1 muM), 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenylpiperazinium (K-i, 0.5 muM), decamethonium (K-i, 175 muM) and methyllycaconitine (K-i, 0.4 muM). These studies show that the pharmacological characteristics of recombinant bovine alpha(3)beta(4) nAChRs are similar to native bovine alpha(3)beta(4)* nAChRs, and indicate that the alpha5 subunit, if present in the native nAChRs, does not affect ligand affinity.

We report here that mutations of the YIPP motif strongly affect ligand-binding to the receptor. We analysed AT(1) receptors of the wild type (WT) and 11 mutants with a FLAG-epitope-tag within their C-terminal portion. Mutations of the "P-P" amino acid sequence of this motif decreased both AII binding and the AII-induced intracellular Ca2+ transients. Mutant and WT receptors were expressed equally in the cell membrane and were localized within the plasma membrane. These results suggest that the "P-P" amino acid sequence within the YIPP motif is important for AII binding to the AT(1) receptor. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Dopamine D<sub>4</sub> Receptor-Selective Compounds Reveal Structure-Activity Relationships that Engender Agonist Efficacy	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IMPROVES COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; INDUCED DYSKINESIA; D3 RECEPTOR; PROTEIN; DYNAMICS; MICE; STIMULATION; ANTAGONISTS; DISCOVERY; A-412997	The dopamine D-4 receptor (D4R) plays important roles in cognition, attention, and decision making. Novel D4R-selective ligands have promise in medication development for neuropsychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and substance use disorders. To identify new D4R-selective ligands, and to understand the molecular determinants of agonist efficacy at D4R, we report a series of eighteen novel ligands based on the classical D4R agonist A-412997 (1, 2-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-N-(m-tolyl)acetamide). Compounds were profiled using radioligand binding displacement assays, beta-arrestin recruitment assays, cyclic AMP inhibition assays, and molecular dynamics computational modeling. We identified several novel D4R-selective (K-i <= 4.3 nM and >100-fold vs other D-2-like receptors) compounds with diverse partial agonist and antagonist profiles, falling into three structural groups. These compounds highlight receptor-ligand interactions that control efficacy at D-2-like receptors and may provide insights into targeted drug discovery, leading to a better understanding of the role of D(4)Rs in neuropsychiatric disorders.

In the present paper, novel enantiomerically pure analogues were synthesized and optimized for their sigma receptor affinity and selectivity. Docking studies rationalized the results obtained in the radioligand binding assay. Absolute stereochemistry was unequivocally established by X-ray analysis of precursor trans-(+)-5a as camphorsulfonyl derivative 9. The most promising compound, trans-(+)-1d, showed remarkable selectivity over a panel of more than 15 receptors as well as good chemical and enzymatic stability in human plasma. An in vivo evaluation evidenced that trans-(+)-1d, in contrast to trans-(-)-1d, cis-(+)-1d, or cis-(-)-1d, which behave as sigma(1) antagonists, exhibited a sigma(1) agonist profile. These data clearly demonstrated that compound trans-(+)-1d, due to its sigma(1) agonist activity and favorable receptor selectivity and stability, provided an useful tool for the study of sigma(1) receptors.

Each analogue was evaluated in radioligand binding displacement assays at both human OTR and arginine vasopressin la receptors (V1aR). Physiological characterisation was determined by whole cell IP1 accumulation assays on stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Incorporation of the rigid, optionally substituted benzene ring abolished OTR activity and diminished V1aR pharmacology when compared to 1. A general trend was observed in V1aR affinity for the propyl analogues (3d-3f) which identified the ortho-substituted analogue as the best in series (Ki = 251 nM) followed by a decrease in affinity through the meta and para-derivatives (3e; Ki = 874 nM and 3f; Ki = 1756 nM respectively). This study confirms the importance of the central pharmacophoric motifs of WAY-267,464 and illuminates the differences in the binding pocket of the highly conserved OTR and V1aR.

Here, we sought to replicate and extend these findings by also examining neurochemical correlates of transfer. Four positron emission tomography (PET) scans using the radioligand raclopride were performed. Two of these assessed DAD2 binding (letter memory; n-back) before 5 weeks of updating training, and the same two scans were performed post training. Key findings were (a) pronounced training-related behavioral gains in the lettermemory criterion task, (b) altered striatal DAD2 binding potential after training during letter-memory performance, suggesting training-induced increases in DA release, and (c) increased striatal DA activity also during the n-back transfer task after the intervention, but no concomitant behavioral transfer. The fact that the training-related DA alterations during the transfer task were not accompanied by behavioral transfer suggests that increased DA release may be a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for behavioral transfer to occur.

Psalmotoxin-1 Docking to Human Acid-sensing Ion Channel-1	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TARANTULA TOXIN PSALMOTOXIN-1; POISSON-BOLTZMANN EQUATION; PROTEIN-DOCKING; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; PEPTIDE INHIBITOR; PK(A) VALUES; NA+ CHANNEL; ASIC1A; PH; RATIONALIZATION	Acid- sensing ion channel-1 (ASIC-1) is a proton-gated ion channel implicated in nociception and neuronal death during ischemia. Recently the first crystal structure of a chicken ASIC was obtained. Expanding upon this work, homology models of the human ASICs were constructed and evaluated. Energy-minimized structures were tested for validity by in silico docking of the models to psalmotoxin-1, which potently inhibits ASIC-1 and not other members of the family. The data are consistent with prior radioligand binding and functional assays while also explaining the selectivity of PcTX-1 for homomeric hASIC-1a. Binding energy calculations suggest that the toxin and channel create a complex that is more stable than the channel alone. The binding is dominated by the coulombic contributions, which account for why the toxin-channel interaction is not observed at low pH. The computational data were experimentally verified with single channel and whole-cell electrophysiological studies. These validated models should allow for the rational design of specific and potent peptidomimetic compounds that may be useful for the treatment of pain or ischemic stroke.

Antisense knockdown of sigma receptors also mitigates METH-induced stimulant effects, suggesting that these proteins are viable medication development targets for treating psychostimulant abuse. In the present study, AC927, a sigma receptor antagonist, was evaluated for its ability to attenuate METH-induced effects in vivo and in vitro. Radioligand binding studies showed that AC927 had preferential affinity for sigma receptors compared to 29 other receptors, transporters and ion channels, Pretreatment of mate, Swiss Webster mice with AC927 significantly attenuated METH-induced locomotor stimulation, striatal dopamine depletions, striatal dopamine transporter reductions, and hyperthermia. When the neurotoxicity of METH was further examined in vitro under temperature-controlled conditions, co-incubation with AC927 mitigated METH-induced cytotoxicity. Together, the results demonstrate that AC927 protects against METH-induced effects, and suggests a new strategy for treating psychostimulant abuse. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

The tissue dissection method represented an age-related decrease in the uptake ratio of the striatum to the cerebellum and in the specific binding-to-nonspecific binding ratio of [C-11]CFT. PET demonstrated an age-dependent decrease in the striatal uptake of [C-11]CFT, however, the kinetic analysis represented the age-related decrease in both the association rate constant (k(3)) and dissociation rate constant (k(4)), but not the binding potential (k(3)/k(4)) that was a parameter including both of density and affinity of the binding sites. The PET finding was not necessarily coincident with the result investigated in vitro previously. Therefore, careful interpretation is necessary for PET studies using [C-11]CFT and small animals such as rats.

Its use however, is associated with life-threatening agranulocytosis. The mechanism by which this occurs and its possible relationship with the drug's atypicality remain unclear. As a first step in identifying mechanistic pathways involved, profiling of neurotransmitter receptors on human neutrophils, mononuclear and bone marrow stromal cells as putative targets for clozapine-mediated toxicity was undertaken. Expression of mRNA encoding dopaminergic d2, d3, d4; serotonergic 5ht2a, 5ht2c, 5ht3, 5ht6, 5ht7; adrenergic alpha1a, alpha2; histaminergic h1 and muscarinic m1, m2, m3, m4, m5 receptors was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods. While 5ht2c, 5ht6, m1 and m2 mRNA were undetected, the presence of the other receptors indicates sites at which clozapine could bind and induce toxicity of neutrophils and stromal components which regulate granulopoiesis. The functional significance of differential receptor expression while unknown, may argue for neural regulation of hematopoiesis.

J	Rivkees, SA; Thevananther, S; Hao, HP				Rivkees, SA; Thevananther, S; Hao, HP			Are A3 adenosine receptors expressed in the brain?	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						adenosine; adenosine receptors; brain; testis	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MOLECULAR-CLONING; A(3) RECEPTORS; I-125 4-AMINOBENZYL-5'-N-METHYLCARBOXAMIDOADENOSINE; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; RAT; LOCALIZATION; RADIOLIGAND; RESPONSES	An increasing number of reports suggest a role for A3 adenosine receptors (A3ARs) in mediating adenosine action in the central nervous system. However, studies of A3AR localization in the brain have yet to be performed. To provide insights into the central sites of A3AR action, we compared patterns of A1 and A3AR mRNA and binding site expression in the brains of rats, mice and humans. We also assessed whether A3 agonists are selective for A3ARs. Whereas it was possible to detect high-level A1AR expression in many brain regions, it was not possible to detect either A3AR gene or binding sire expression in the central nervous system. When we examined the affinities of the A3AR agonists Cl-IAB-MECA and IAB-MECA for A1ARs, we found that these compounds bound to AIARs with high affinity. These observations suggest that studies using A3-agonists need to consider potential effects of A1ARs activation, as A1ARs are abundantly expressed in the nervous system whereas A3AR expression in the brain cannot be directly demonstrated.

On the other hand, both A-184209 (K-i = 1.34 muM) and A-184208 (K-i = 1.14 muM) displaced binding of the KCO radioligand, [I-125]A-312110 in guinea-pig bladder membranes with similar affinities. 7 These studies demonstrate that A-184209 is a novel and structurally distinct compound that inhibits K-ATP channels in smooth muscle with potencies comparable to glyburide. The structural overlap between DHP openers and blockers, together with their differential interaction with ligand binding sites, support the notion that both openers and blockers bind to similar or very closely coupled sites on the sulfonylurea receptor and that subtle changes in the pharmacophore itself could switch functional properties from K-ATP channel activation to inhibition.

In the current study, we aimed to investigate the regulatory effect of icariin and its active metabolites (icariside II and icaritin) against prime G-protein-coupled receptor targets, considering their association with neuronal disorders. Icariside II exhibited selective agonist activity towards the dopamine D3 receptor (D3R), with half-maximal effective concentrations of 13.29 mu M. Additionally, they effectively inhibited the specific binding of radioligands to D3R. Molecular docking analysis revealed that icariside II potentially exerts its agonistic effect through hydrogen-bonding interaction with Asp110 of the D3R, accompanied by negative binding energy. Conversely, icaritin demonstrated selective antagonist effects on the muscarinic acetylcholine M2 receptor (M2R). Radioligand binding assay and molecular docking analysis identified icaritin as an orthosteric ligand for M2R. Furthermore, all three compounds, icariin and its two metabolites, successfully mitigated MK-801-induced schizophrenia-like symptoms, including deficits in prepulse inhibition and social interaction, in mice. In summary, these findings highlight the potential of icariin and its metabolites as promising lead structures for the discovery of new drugs targeting cognitive and neurodegenerative disorders.

[11C]ER176 robustly quantifies TSPO in the human brain with positron emission tomography (PET), irrespective of subject genotype. We aimed to develop an ER176 analog with potential for labeling with longer-lived fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min). New fluoro and trifluoromethyl analogs of ER176 were prepared through a concise synthetic strategy. These ligands showed high TSPO affinity and low human genotype sensitivity. Each ligand was initially labeled by a generic C-11-methylation procedure, thereby enabling speedy screening in mice. Each radioligand was rapidly taken up and well retained in the mouse brain at baseline after intravenous injection. Preblocking of TSPO showed that high proportions of brain uptake were specifically bound to TSPO at baseline. Overall, the 3-fluoro analog of [C-11]ER176 ([C-11]3b) displayed the most promising imaging properties. Therefore, a method was developed to label 3b with [F-18]fluoride ion. [F-18]3b gave similarly promising PET imaging results and deserves evaluation in higher species.

Encouraged by preliminary results obtained with [C-11](Z)-N-(3- (2-methoxyethyl)-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)-2,2,3,3-tetramethyl-cyclopropanecarboxamide ([C-11]A-836339, [C-11]1) in a mouse model of acute neuroinflammation (induced by lipopolysaccharide, LPS), we designed a library of fluorinated analogs aiming for an [F-18]-labeled radiotracer with improved CB2 binding affinity and selectivity. Compound (Z)-N-(3-(4-fluorobutyl)-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)-2,2,3,3-tetramethyl-cyclopropanecarboxamide (29) was selected as a ligand with the highest CB2 affinity (K-i = 0.39 nM) and selectivity over CB1 (factor 1000). [F-18]29 was prepared starting from the bromo precursor (53). Specific binding was shown in vitro whereas fast metabolism was observed in vivo in CD-1 mice. Animal PET revealed a brain uptake comparable to [C-11]1. In the LPS treated mice, a 20-30% higher uptake in brain was found in comparison to non-treated mice (n = 3, P < 0.05).

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the clinical utility of [F-18]THK-5117 as a highly selective tau imaging radiotracer. Methods We initially evaluated in vitro binding of [H-3]THK-5117 in post-mortem brain tissues from patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). In clinical PET studies, [F-18]THK-5117 retention in eight patients with AD was compared with that in six healthy elderly controls. Ten subjects underwent an additional [C-11]PiB PET scan within 2 weeks. Results In post-mortem brain samples, THK-5117 bound selectively to neurofibrillary deposits, which differed from the binding target of PiB. In clinical PET studies, [F-18]THK-5117 binding in the temporal lobe clearly distinguished patients with AD from healthy elderly subjects. Compared with [C-11]PiB, [F-18]THK-5117 retention was higher in the medial temporal cortex.

Biological studies in Wistar rats showed the ability of Tc-99m-TPCC to cross the intact blood-brain barrier. In vivo biodistribution indicated that this complex had good brain uptake (1.32% ID/g at 5 min and 0.64% ID/g at 60 min) and good retention (about 50% of the activity was retained in the brain at 60 min post-injection). Regional brain distribution study showed that hippocampus, where the 5-HT1A receptor density is high, had the highest uptake (0.73% ID/g at 5min p.i.) and the cerebellum, where the 5-HT1A receptor density is low, had the lowest uptake (0.12% ID/gID/g at 5 min p.i.). After blocking with 8-hydroxy-2-(dipropylamino) tetralin, the uptake of hippocampus was decreased significantly from 0.73% ID/g to 0.20% ID/g at 5min p.i., while the cerebellum had no significant decrease. This result indicates that Tc-99m complex has specific binding to 5-HT1A receptor.

Positron emission tomography imaging of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors using a highly selective radiolabeled D<sub>2</sub> receptor partial agonist	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Dopamine; Dopamine D-2 receptors; Positron emission tomography	NONHUMAN PRIMATE BRAIN; IN-VIVO; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; RAT-BRAIN; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BENZAMIDE ANALOGS; BINDING-SITES; PET; RADIOLIGAND; LIGANDS	A series of microPET imaging studies were conducted in anesthetized rhesus monkeys using the dopamine D-2-selective partial agonist, [C-11]SV-III-130. There was a high uptake in regions of brain known to express a high density of D-2 receptors under baseline conditions. Rapid displacement in the caudate and putamen, but not in the cerebellum, was observed after injection of the dopamine D-2/3 receptor nonselective ligand S(-)-eticlopride at a low dosage (0.025 mg/kg/Lv.); no obvious displacement in the caudate, putamen and cerebellum was observed after the treatment with a dopamine D-3 receptor selective ligand WC-34 (0.1 mg/kg/i.v.). Pretreatment with lorazepam (1 mg/kg, i.v. 30 mm) to reduce endogenous dopamine prior to tracer injection resulted in unchanged binding potential (BP) values, a measure of D-2 receptor binding in vivo, in the caudate and putamen. D-Amphetamine challenge studies indicate that there is a significant displacement of [C-11]SV-III-130 by D-Amphetamine-induced increases in synaptic dopamine levels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

In gpGnRH, the highly conserved histidine in position 2 (His(2)) and leucine in position 7 (Leu(7)) are substituted by tyrosine and valine, respectively. In vivo, gpGnRH was shown to be less potent than mGnRH, possibly in part because of higher susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. In the present in vitro experiments, we observed that gpGnRH was less potent than mGnRH in stimulating the release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from primary pituitary cell cultures of the rat, and at lower concentrations from primary pituitary cell culture of the guinea pig, too. These results were confirmed by radioligand-binding studies. It is concluded that the lower biological activity of gpGnRH in both rat and guinea pig may be explained by the difference in binding to the target cells, although additional factors such as proteolytic degradation may also contribute to the observed phenomenon.

Correlated theoretical, spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic studies of a non-covalent molecularly imprinted polymerisation system	ANALYST			English	Article							SOLID-STATE TRANSFORMATIONS; RECOGNITION PROPERTIES; SELF-ASSOCIATION; NAPROXEN; POLYMERS; NMR; TEMPLATE; SELECTIVITY; MECHANISMS; PHASE	The correlation of the recognition properties of a molecularly imprinted polymer ( MIP) with the recognition events in pre- polymerisation mixtures is of central importance to our understanding of the molecular imprinting technique. Using the NSAID naproxen as a model template, we have applied parallel theoretical (molecular dynamics) and practical (H-1- NMR, X- ray crystallography, HPLC, radioligand binding) methods to examine the nature of template- functional monomer complexation. An effective imprint is achieved, despite the presence of only one site on the template which provides for the formation of effective electrostatic interactions with the functional monomer used, 4- vinylpyridine. This is attributed to the creation of a well- defined receptor site for the acidic terminus of the molecule and complementary van der Waals interactions, as described in preliminary simulations of the pre- polymerisation system, and as confirmed for the resultant MIP by HPLC data. Qualitative agreement is also observed between simulation and proton NMR data examining monomer self- association in the presence and absence of the template. On the basis of the data obtained, the role of a cross- linker appears to be more significant for this system than previously anticipated.

In this study, we sought evidence that this oligomerization leads to cooperativity by examining the binding of three radioligands ([H-3] nemonapride, [H-3] raclopride, and [H-3] spiperone) to D 2 dopamine receptors expressed in membranes of Sf9 cells. In saturation binding experiments, the three radioligands exhibited different B-max values, and the B-max values could be altered by the addition of sodium ions to assays. Despite labeling different numbers of sites, the different ligands were able to achieve full inhibition in competition experiments. Some ligand pairs also exhibited complex inhibition curves in these experiments. In radioligand dissociation experiments, the rate of dissociation of [H-3] nemonapride or [H-3] spiperone depended on the sodium ion concentration but was independent of the competing ligand. Although some of the data in this study are consistent with the behavior of a cooperative oligomeric receptor, not all of the data are in agreement with this model. It may, therefore, be necessary to consider more complex models for the behavior of this receptor.

Compounds 7a-g,i and 8a-g at a final concentration of 1 muM significantly inhibited [H-3]CCPA (2-chloro-N-6-cyclopentyladenosine) agonist binding to human A, adenosine receptors. At the same concentration, all compounds appeared to increase [3H]DPCPX (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine) antagonist binding. Compound 7a and LUF5855 (7g) were selected for further characterization and studied in both equilibrium and kinetic radioligand binding experiments. The results suggest a nonstoichiometric interaction with the receptor. Further bioanalytical procedures (HPLC and MS) provided proof for an unusual receptor interaction in which 7a and 7g upon incubation were transformed into their corresponding thioureas 5a and 5g. We suggest that the thiadiazoles are sulfhydryl modifying agents rather than allosteric modulators, as they appear to reversibly modify the sulfhydryl groups of cysteine residues in cell membrane preparations.

Methods: Thirteen postmenopausal women were administered ERT and underwent neuroimaging, using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1, a radioligand that binds DAT In this 64eek pilot study, subjects underwent SPECT before ERT, after 4 weeks of 0.625 mg/day of conjugated estrogens (CEE), and after an additional 2 weeks of 0.625 mg/day CEE plus 10 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate. Specific uptake values (SUVs) of [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 were calculated for the caudate and putamen. Results: When compared with baseline values, [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 binding demonstrated a modest, but statistically significant, increase in the left anterior putamen after 4 weeks of CEE. After the 64eek ERT intervention, both the left and right anterior putamen demonstrated an increase in SUVs. Conclusion: Short-term administration of ERT in postmenopausal women is associated with a modest increase in DAT in the putamen. These findings may further the understanding of bow ERT is associated with improvement in Parkinson's disease and late-onset schizophrenia.

The authors analyzed this "multilinear method" with respect to its sensitivity to statistical noise, and propose regularization procedures that reduce the effects of statistical noise. Computer simulations and singular value decomposition of its operational equation were used to investigate the sensitivity of the multilinear method to statistical noise. Regularization was performed by truncated singular value decomposition, Tikhonov-Phillips regularization, and by imposing boundary constraints on the rate constants. There was a significant underestimation of distribution volume ratios. Singular value decomposition showed that the bias was caused by statistical noise. The regularization procedures significantly increased the test-retest stability. The bias could be reduced by applying linear constraints on the rate constants based on their normal range. Underestimation of distribution volume ratios by the multilinear method is caused by its sensitivity to statistical noise. Statistical power in the discrimination of different groups of subjects can be significantly improved by regularization procedures without introducing additional bias. Correct distribution volume ratios can be obtained by imposing physiologic constraints on the rate constants.

J	Shi, CC; Liao, JF; Chen, CF				Shi, CC; Liao, JF; Chen, CF			Spasmolytic effects of three harmala alkaloids on guinea-pig isolated trachea	PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							MONOAMINE-OXIDASE; BETA-CARBOLINES; BINDING; RECEPTOR; RADIOLIGAND; INHIBITION; RAT	The present study examined and compared the spasmolytic effects of 3 harmala alkaloids, harmine, harman, and harmaline, on carbachol-, histamine-, and KCI-induced contractions of guinea-pig isolated tracheal preparations. All 3 compounds relaxed the tracheal preparations contracted by these spasmogens with similar or different EC50 values, harmine being the most potent one. The cumulative concentration-response curves of all 3 compounds for carbachol-induced contraction were shifted to the right by propranolol (I VM) pretreatment, indicating the involvement of the activation on the beta -adrenoceptors. All 3 compounds shifted the concentration-response curves of carbachol to the right in a parallel manner with the pA(2) values comparable with their relaxation EC50 values, indicating a competitive antagonism at the muscarinic receptors. Receptor binding assays indicated that all 3 compounds interacted with lung muscarinic receptors (K-i = 11-13 muM), histamine H-1 receptors (K-i = 27-107 muM), and beta (2)-adrenoceptors (K-i = 20-51 muM). Therefore, in addition to their actions on receptor-linked and voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels as reported in other types of smooth muscle, the present study suggests that the actions on muscarinic receptors, histamine H-1 receptors, and beta (2)-adrenoceptors are also involved in their spasmolytic effects on airway smooth muscles.

We also determined the role of this subtype in stimulating phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis in adult rat cardiac myocytes. BMY 7378 inhibited [H-3]prazosin binding to cardiac membranes in a biphasic mode with a pK(i) of 9.19 +/- 0.26 for high affinity sites and 6.64 +/- 0.09 for low affinity sites. The inhibition of the adrenaline-induced stimulation of PI hydrolysis by BMY 7378 fitted a one-site model and the calculated pK(b) value (6.92 +/- 0.28) was consistent with the involvement of alpha (1A) and alpha (1B) adrenoceptors. In addition, BMY 7378, at concentrations up to 100 nM, did not significantly affect the concentration-response curves for the adrenaline-induced stimulation of PI hydrolysis. Taken together, these data suggest that alpha (1D)-adrenoceptors are expressed in adult rat heart but this subtype is not involved in the adrenaline-induced stimulation of PI hydrolysis.

Method We scanned all participants with the PET radioligand C-11-(R)-PK-11195 and undertook structural MRI to measure gray matter volume and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA). Results We found increased binding of C-11-(R)-PK-11195 in total white matter compared to controls (p < 0.01), but not in gray matter regions, and this did not correlate with illness severity or duration. Gray matter was reduced in the thalamus (p < 0.0001) in patients, who also showed widespread reductions in FA across the brain compared to controls (p < 0.001). A significant correlation between C-11-(R)-PK11195 binding and FA was shown (p = 0.002), driven by the NPC patient group. Conclusions Our findings suggest that neuroinflammation-particularly in white matter-may underpin some structural and degenerative changes in patients with NPC.

In the present work we studied the effect of CLZ on the dopamine D-2 receptors (D2R) in the mouse brain. CLZ was administered after ketamine (KET) in a paradigm strictly matching the one used in KET-induced attentional set-shifting task (ASST). It has been shown previously that CLZ reversed KET-induced cognitive impairments. In the present study we used in situ hybridization to estimate the level of mRNA, together with specific D2R radioligand, [H-3] domperidone binding in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) as well as in the striatum, and observed an increase in the [H-3]domperidone binding in the striatum and an increase in D2R mRNA level in the VTA following repeated (but not acute) CLZ administration in mice pre-treated repeatedly with KET. The obtained results allow for conclusion that CLZ in this experimental paradigm enhances biosynthesis of presynaptic D2R.

The human A(3)AR (hA(3)AR) subtype is implicated in several cytoprotective functions. Therefore, hA(3)AR modulators, and in particular agonists, are sought for their potential application as anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and cardioprotective agents. Here, we prepared novel adenosine derivatives with indole moiety as hA(3)AR ligands. According to the biological assay, we found that 2-substituents 11 were critical structural determinants for A(3)AR ligands (K-i = 111 nM). The observed structure-affinity relationships of this class of ligands were also exhaustively rationalized using the molecular modelling approach. This allows the investigation on the binding mode of the potential compound in the ligand-binding pocket of the human A(3) receptor. The results demonstrated that 11 can interact with the ASN250, GLN167, PHE168 and VAL178 through hydrogen bonding, which are shown to be important for ligand-receptor interaction.

Efficacy at the hA(2B) and antagonism of selected ligands at the hA(3) were also assessed through cAMP experiments. Some of the new derivatives exhibited good to high hA(3)AR affinity and selectivity versus all the other AR subtypes. Compound 2-(4-chlorophenyl)-5-methyl-thiazolo[5,4-d]pyrimidine-7-one 4 was found to be the most potent and selective ligand of the series (K-i hA(3) = 18 nM).

The EP<sub>1</sub> subtype of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> receptor: Role in keratinocyte differentiation and expression in non-melanoma skin cancer	PROSTAGLANDINS LEUKOTRIENES AND ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS			English	Article						EP1 subtype of prostaglandin E2 receptor; Keratinocyte differentiation; Calcium mobilization; Non-melanoma skin cancer	PROSTANOID RECEPTORS; MOUSE SKIN; TERMINAL DIFFERENTIATION; EPIDERMAL-KERATINOCYTES; E SYNTHASE; PROTEIN; GROWTH; CELLS; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION	We have previously demonstrated that the EP1 subtype of PGE(2) receptor is expressed in the differentiated compartment of normal human epidermis and is coupled to intracellular calcium mobilization. We therefore hypothesized that the EP1 receptor is coupled to keratinocyte differentiation. In in vitro studies, radioligand binding, RT-PCR, immunoblot and receptor agonist-induced second messenger studies demonstrate that the EP1 receptor is up-regulated by high cell density in human keratinocytes and this up-regulation precedes corneocyte formation. Moreover, two different EP1 receptor antagonists, SC51322 and AH6809, both inhibited corneocyte formation. SC51322 also inhibited the induction of differentiation-specific proteins, cytokeratin K10 and epidermal transglutaminase. We next examined the immunolocalization of the EP1 receptor in non-melanoma skin cancer in humans. Well-differentiated SCCs exhibited significantly greater membrane staining, while spindle cell carcinomas and BCCs had significantly decreased membrane staining compared with normal epidermis. This data supports a role for the EP1 receptor in regulating keratinocyte differentiation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Konger, R. L.; Billings, S. D.; Prall, N. C.; Katona, T.

Different classes of small CXCR2 antagonists have been developed. In this study, we selected seven CXCR2 antagonists from the diarylurea, imidazolylpyrimide, and thiazolopyrimidine class and studied their mechanisms of action at human CXCR2. All compounds are able to displace I-125-CXCL8 and inhibit CXCL8-induced beta-arrestin2 recruitment. Detailed studies with representatives of each class showed that these compounds displace and antagonize CXCL8, most probably via a noncompetitive, allosteric mechanism. In addition, we radiolabeled the high-affinity CXCR2 antagonist SB265610 [1-(2-bromophenyl)-3-(4-cyano-1H-benzo[d] [1,2,3]-triazol-7-yl)urea] and subjected [H-3] SB265610 to a detailed analysis. The binding of this radioligand was saturable and reversible. Using [ 3H] SB265610, we found that compounds of the different chemical classes bind to distinct binding sites. Hence, the use of a radiolabeled low-molecular weight CXCR2 antagonist serves as a tool to investigate the different binding sites of CXCR2 antagonists in more detail.

Plasma melatonin was measured using a radioimmunoassay, while binding assays were performed using 2-[125I]iodomelatonin as a radioligand. Plasma melatonin concentrations were significantly lower at mid-light (189.546pg/ml) than mid-dark (455.5163 pg/ml). Values of Bmax were statistically significantly higher in the optic tectum (5.60.6 and 12.31fmol/mg prot, at mid-light and mid-dark, respectively) and in the cerebellum (7.71.1 and 10.61.3 fmol/mg prot, at mid-light and mid-dark, respectively). Significant day/night differences were only observed in these two tissues. These results show for the first time the distribution of melatonin binding sites within the brain of a flatfish species and their lack of down-regulation.

Derivatives of (-)-7-methyl-2-(5-(pyridinyl)pyridin-3-yl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane are potential Ligands for positron emission tomography imaging of extrathalamic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO TRACER; ANTINOCICEPTIVE PROPERTIES; EPIBATIDINE; BINDING; ANALOGS; PET; LIPOPHILICITY; ANTAGONIST; AGENTS; BRAIN	A series of novel racemic 7-methyl-2-(5-(pyridinyl)pyridin-3-yl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivatives with picomolar in vitro binding affinity at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) were synthesized and their enantiomers were resolved by semipreparative chiral HPLC. The (-)-enantiomers showed substantially greater in vitro inhibition binding affinity than the corresponding (+)-enantiomers. The compounds with best binding affinities have been radiolabeled with positron emitting isotopes C-11 and F-18 as potential radioligands for positron emission tomography imaging of the nAChR. In vivo enantioselectivity of the radiolabeled (-)7-methyl-2-(5-(pyridinyl)pyridin-3-yl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane derivatives was observed in biodistribution studies in rodents and babon. One of the radiolabeled compounds, (-)-7-methyl-2-exo-[3'-(2-[F-18]-fluoropyridin-5-yl))-5'-pyridinyl]-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, exhibited good properties as a first practical PET radioligand for imaging of extrathalamic nAChR in baboon brain and holds promise for further investigation for human studies.

Moreover, this has largely been achieved without altering their potency at wild-type canine and rat receptors, as judged by their displacement of [I-125]-BH-CCK-8S in a radioligand binding assay and by their activity in an isolated, perfused rat stomach bioassay, respectively. 2-(5-Cyclohexyl-1-(2-cyclopentyl-2-oxo-ethyl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydro-3H-1,3,4-benzotriazepin-3-yl)-N-(3-(5-oxo-2,5-dihydro- [1,2,4]oxadiazol-3-yl)-phenyl)-acetamide (47) was identified as the most effective compound stemming from this approach, proving to be a potent inhibitor of pentagastrin-stimulated gastric acid secretion in rats and dogs by intravenous bolus as well as by enteral administration.

Radioligand binding studies confirmed a greater than 50-fold selectivity of KW6002 for A(2A) receptors compared to A(1) receptors. Release of [H-3]-dopamine from nucleus accumbens slices in vitro was almost doubled in the presence of 300 nM KW6002, while GABA release was inhibited by approximately one third. In vivo, intraperitoneal administration of KW6002 (4 mg kg(-1)) increased dopamine overflow almost 4-fold in the nucleus accumbens. In behavioural testing, KW6002 elicited place preference and increased locomotor activity at 1, 2 and 4 mg kg(-1). Taken together, these results suggest a role for tonic activation of A(2A) adenosine receptors in reward-related phenomena. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The assay is based on scintillation proximity assay, in which a protein is coated on scintillant-incorporated beads, and a radiolabeled ligand stimulates the beads to emit a signal by binding to the immobilized protein. An intrinsic binding affinity of unlabeled ligands is determined by competitive displacement of the radioligand. The protein coating and ligand binding are achieved in one step by simply mixing ligands, protein and beads in sequence. No additional steps of pre-coating and washing of beads are required. Protein is captured on beads effectively by electrostatic interactions, thus no affinity labeling of protein is required. In data analysis, ligands are grouped into two classes based on their binding affinities. For tight binding ligands, an equation is derived to accurately determine the binding affinity. Otherwise a general equation applies. This quantitative and high throughput assay provides a tool to screen a large library of molecules in search of potent ligands. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

J	Böhme, I; Rabe, H; Lüddens, H				Böhme, I; Rabe, H; Lüddens, H			Four amino acids in the α subunits determine the γ-aminobutyric acid sensitivities of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							A RECEPTORS; BINDING; PHARMACOLOGY; CELLS; HIPPOCAMPAL; AFFINITY; CHANNELS; DOMAIN; SITES	GABA(A) receptors, mediators of fast inhibitory neurotransmission, are heteropentameric assemblies from a large array of subunits. Differences in the sensitivity of receptor subtypes to endogenous GABA may permit subunit-dependent finely tuned responsiveness to the same GABAergic inputs. Using both radioligand binding and electrophysiology combined with mutagenesis, we identified a domain of four amino acids within the alpha subunits that mediates the distinct sensitivities to GABA allowing their selective switch between alphabeta3gamma2 combinations. Replacing this domain in alpha3 by the corresponding segments of alpha1-alpha5 resulted in mutant receptors displaying the GABA EC50 values of the respective wild-type receptors. Vice versa, the alpha3 motif forced the low sensitivity to GABA of alpha3 upon alpha1beta3gamma2, alpha4beta3gamma2, and alpha5beta3gamma2. Binding of the GABA agonist [H-3] muscimol was not affected by the exchange of the motif between alpha1 and alpha3 subunits. Thus, the equilibrium binding pocket is maintained upon replacement of the four amino acids. Taken together our data suggest that the identified motifs contribute to a structure involved in the transduction of the binding signal rather than to the binding itself.

Neuroimmune signatures in chronic low back pain subtypes	BRAIN			English	Article						glial cells; functional connectivity; chronic pain; neuropathic; inflammation	TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; GLIAL ACTIVATION; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; PET RADIOLIGAND; SPINAL-CORD; MECHANICAL ALLODYNIA; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; BINDING-SITES; UP-REGULATION	We recently showed that patients with different chronic pain conditions (such as chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, migraine and Gulf War illness) demonstrated elevated brain and/or spinal cord levels of the glial marker 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which suggests that neuroinflammation might be a pervasive phenomenon observable across multiple aetiologically heterogeneous pain disorders. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of this neuroinflammatory signal appears to exhibit a degree of disease specificity (e.g. with respect to the involvement of the primary somatosensory cortex), suggesting that different pain conditions may exhibit distinct 'neuroinflammatory signatures'. To explore this hypothesis further, we tested whether neuroinflammatory signal can characterize putative aetiological subtypes of chronic low back pain patients based on clinical presentation. Specifically, we explored neuroinflammation in patients whose chronic low back pain either did or did not radiate to the leg (i.e. 'radicular' versus 'axial' back pain). Fifty-four patients with chronic low back pain, 26 with axial back pain [43.7 +/- 16.6 years old (mean +/- SD)] and 28 with radicular back pain (48.3 +/- 13.2 years old), underwent PET/MRI with C-11-PBR28, a second-generation radioligand for TSPO. C-11-PBR28 signal was quantified using standardized uptake values ratio (validated against volume of distribution ratio; n = 23). Functional MRI data were collected simultaneously to the C-11-PBR28 data (i) to functionally localize the primary somatosensory cortex back and leg subregions; and (ii) to perform functional connectivity analyses (in order to investigate possible neurophysiological correlations of the neuroinflammatory signal). PET and functional MRI measures were compared across groups, cross-correlated with one another and with the severity of 'fibromyalgianess' (i.e. the degree of pain centralization, or 'nociplastic pain'). Furthermore, statistical mediation models were used to explore possible causal relationships between these three variables. For the primary somatosensory cortex representation of back/leg, C-11-PBR28 PET signal and functional connectivity to the thalamus were: (i) higher in radicular compared to axial back pain patients; (ii) positively correlated with each other; (iii) positively correlated with fibromyalgianess scores, across groups; and finally (iv) fibromyalgianess mediated the association between C-11-PBR28 PET signal and primary somatosensory cortex-thalamus connectivity across groups. Our findings support the existence of 'neuroinflammatory signatures' that are accompanied by neurophysiological changes and correlate with clinical presentation (in particular, with the degree of nociplastic pain) in chronic pain patients. These signatures may contribute to the subtyping of distinct pain syndromes and also provide information about interindividual variability in neuroimmune brain signals, within diagnostic groups, that could eventually serve as targets for mechanism-based precision medicine approaches.

The enhanced TSPO PET signal that arises during disease is widely considered to reflect activated pathogenic microglia, although quantitative neuropathological data to support this interpretation have not been available. With the increasing interest in the role of chronic microglial activation in multiple sclerosis, characterising the cellular neuropathology associated with TSPO expression is of clear importance for understanding the cellular and pathological processes on which TSPO PET imaging is reporting. Here we have studied the cellular expression of TSPO and specific binding of two TSPO targeting radioligands (H-3-PK11195 and H-3-PBR28) in tissue sections from 42 multiple sclerosis cases and 12 age-matched controls. Markers of homeostatic and reactive microglia, astrocytes, and lymphocytes were used to investigate the phenotypes of cells expressing TSPO. There was an approximate 20-fold increase in cells double positive for TSPO and HLA-DR in active lesions and in the rim of chronic active lesion, relative to normal appearing white matter. TSPO was uniformly expressed across myeloid cells irrespective of their phenotype, rather than being preferentially associated with pro-inflammatory microglia or macrophages. TSPO+ astrocytes were increased up to 7-fold compared to normal-appearing white matter across all lesion subtypes and accounted for 25% of the TSPO+ cells in these lesions. To relate TSPO protein expression to ligand binding, specific binding of the TSPO ligands H-3-PK11195 and H-3-PBR28 was determined in the same lesions. TSPO radioligand binding was increased up to seven times for H-3-PBR28 and up to two times for H-3-PK11195 in active lesions and the centre of chronic active lesions and a strong correlation was found between the radioligand binding signal for both tracers and the number of TSPO+ cells across all of the tissues examined. In summary, in multiple sclerosis, TSPO expression arises from microglia of different phenotypes, rather than being restricted to microglia which express classical pro-inflammatory markers. While the majority of cells expressing TSPO in active lesions or chronic active rims are microglia/macrophages, our findings also emphasize the significant contribution of activated astrocytes, as well as smaller contributions from endothelial cells. These observations establish a quantitative framework for interpretation of TSPO in multiple sclerosis and highlight the need for neuropathological characterization of TSPO expression for the interpretation of TSPO PET in other neurodegenerative disorders.

Monoamine Oxidase B Total Distribution Volume in the Prefrontal Cortex of Major Depressive Disorder: An [<SUP>11</SUP>C]SL25.1188 Positron Emission Tomography Study	JAMA PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE ENZYME AUTORADIOGRAPHY; FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; MAO-B; HUMAN-BRAIN; CELL PATHOLOGY; IN-VITRO; RADIOLIGAND; REDUCTION; STRESS; NEUROTOXICITY	ImportanceMonoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) is an important, high-density enzyme in the brain that generates oxidative stress by hydrogen peroxide production, alters mitochondrial function, and metabolizes nonserotonergic monoamines. Recent advances in positron emission tomography radioligand development for MAO-B in humans enable highly quantitative measurement of MAO-B distribution volume (MAO-B V-T), an index of MAO-B density. To date, this is the first investigation of MAO-B in the brain of major depressive disorder that evaluates regions beyond the raphe and amygdala. ObjectiveTo investigate whether MAO-B V-T is elevated in the prefrontal cortex in major depressive episodes (MDEs) of major depressive disorder. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis case-control study was performed at a tertiary care psychiatric hospital from April 1, 2014, to August 30, 2018. Twenty patients with MDEs without current psychiatric comorbidities and 20 age-matched controls underwent carbon 11-labeled [C-11]SL25.1188 positron emission tomography scanning to measure MAO-B V-T. All participants were drug and medication free, nonsmoking, and otherwise healthy. Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe MAO-B V-T in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The second main outcome was to evaluate the association between MAO-B V-T in the PFC and duration of major depressive disorder illness. ResultsTwenty patients with MDEs (mean [SD] age, 34.2 [13.2] years; 11 women) and 20 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 33.7 [13.1] years; 10 women) were recruited. Patients with MDEs had significantly greater MAO-B V-T in the PFC (mean, 26%; analysis of variance, F-1,F-38=19.6, P<.001). In individuals with MDEs, duration of illness covaried positively with MAO-B V-T in the PFC (analysis of covariance, F-1,F-18=15.2, P=.001), as well as most other cortex regions and the thalamus. Conclusions and RelevanceFifty percent (10 of 20) of patients with MDEs had MAO-B V-T values in the PFC exceeding those of healthy controls. Greater MAO-B V-T is an index of MAO-B overexpression, which may contribute to pathologies of mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated synthesis of neurotoxic products, and increased metabolism of nonserotonergic monoamines. Hence, this study identifies a common pathological marker associated with downstream consequences poorly targeted by the common selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatments. It is also recommended that the highly selective MAO-B inhibitor medications that are compatible for use with other antidepressants and have low risk for hypertensive crisis should be developed or repurposed as adjunctive treatment for MDEs.

We report our experience with Ac-225-PSMA-617 therapy in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced metastatic prostate carcinoma. Methods Seventeen patients with advanced prostate cancer were selected for treatment with Ac-225-PSMA-617 in 2-month intervals, with initial activity of 8MBq, then de-escalation to 7MBq, 6MBq or 4MBq in cases of good response. In one patient, activity was escalated to 13MBq in the third cycle. Fourteen patients had three treatment cycles administered, while in three patients treatment was discontinued after twocycles due to good response. Six out of 17 patients received additional treatments after the third cycle. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured every 4 weeks for PSA response assessment. Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT was used for functional response assessment before each subsequent treatment cycle. Serial full blood count, renal function test, and liver function were obtained to determine treatment-related side effects. Results Good antitumor activity assessed by serum PSA level and Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT was seen in 16/17 patients. In 14/17 patients, PSA decline >= 90% was seen after treatment, including seven patients with undetectable serum PSA following two (2/7) or three cycles (5/7) cycles of Ac-225-PSMA-617. Fifteen of 17 patients had a > 50% decline in lesions avidity for tracer on Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT including 11 patients with complete resolution (PET-negative and either stable sclerosis on CT for bone or resolution of lymph node metastases) of all metastatic lesions. Grade 1/2 xerostomia was seen in all patients, and none was severe enough to lead to discontinuation of treatment. One patient had with extensive bone marrow metastases and a background anemia developed a grade 3 anemia while another patient with solitary kidney and pre-treatment grade 3 renal failure developed grade 4 renal toxicity following treatment. The group presented with significant palliation of bone pain and reduced toxicity to salivary glands due to de-escalation. Conclusions Ac-225-PSMA-617 RLT of chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced metastatic prostate carcinoma led to a >= 90% decline in serum PSA in 82% of patients including 41% of patients with undetectable serum PSA who remained in remission 12 months after therapy. The remarkable therapeutic efficacy reported in this study could be achieved with reduced toxicity to salivary glands due to de-escalation of administered activities in subsequent treatment cycles. This necessitates further exploration for informing clinical practice and clinical trial design.

While the effects of bisphenol derivatives on ER alpha have been thoroughly evaluated, how these chemicals affect ER beta signaling is less well understood. Herein, we sought to identify novel ER beta ligands using a radioligand competitive binding assay to screen a chemical library of bisphenol derivatives. Many of the compounds identified showed intriguing dual activities as both ER alpha agonists and ER beta antagonists. Docking simulations of these compounds and ER beta suggested that they bound not only to the canonical binding site of ER beta but also to the coactivator binding site located on the surface of the receptor, suggesting that they act as coactivator-binding inhibitors (CBIs). Receptor-ligand binding experiments using WT and mutated ER beta support the presence of a second ligand-interaction position at the coactivator-binding site in ER beta, and direct binding experiments of ER beta and a coactivator peptide confirmed that these compounds act as CBIs. Our study is the first to propose that bisphenol derivatives act as CBIs, presenting critical insight for the future development of ER signaling-based drugs and their potential to function as endocrine disruptors.

Synthesis and Cerebrovascular Anti-Ischemic Activity of New 5-Hydroxyadamantan-2-One Derivatives	PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY JOURNAL			English	Article						5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one derivatives with heteroaromatic, aromatic, and aliphatic acids; cerebral circulation; brain ischemia; nicotinic acid; succinic acid; bicuculline; GABA(A)-receptors	BINDING; BRAIN	New 5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one derivatives with heteroaromatic, aromatic, and aliphatic acids (nicotinic, succinic, p-chlorophenoxyacetic, 3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoic, and anisic) were synthesized. Their pharmacological properties were studied to discover compounds with cerebrovascular anti-ischemic activity and without hypotensive activity. Esters of succinic acid and 5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one (diester Ia and monoester Ib, 100 mg/kg, i.v.) exhibited the most potent effect on cerebral circulation under ischemic conditions. They did not lower arterial blood pressure. The monoester was less toxic with LD50 740.0 (676.0 - 804.0) mg/kg. Analysis of the cerebrovascular effects of the succinate esters of 5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one using bicuculline revealed a GABA-ergic mechanism of action on cerebral vessels. However, radioligand analysis in vitro using the specific ligand [H-3]-SR 95531 found that these esters did not compete for rat-brain membrane GABA(A)-receptors. Thus, the monoester of succinic acid and 5-hydroxyadamantan-2-one possessed pronounced cerebrovascular anti-ischemic activity and did not produce hypotensive effects. The latter circumstance differentiated it from well-known drugs used in neurology (picamilon, Mexidol, nimodipine, cinnarizine, and Cavinton).	[Kurza, E. V.; Avdyunina, N. I.; Gan'shina, T.

The maximal electroshock (MES) and the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) seizure models were used for screening all the compounds. The 6 Hz model of pharmacoresistant limbic seizures was applied for studying selected derivatives. Six amides were chosen for pharmacological characterization of their antinociceptive activity in the formalin model of tonic pain as well as local anesthetic activity was assessed in mice. The pharmacological data indicate on the broad spectra of activity across the preclinical seizure models. Compounds 10 (ED50 = 32.08 mg/kg, MES test) and 9 (ED50 = 40.34 mg/kg, scPTZ test) demonstrated the highest potency. These compounds displayed considerably better safety profiles than clinically relevant antiepileptic drugs phenytoin, ethosuximide, or valproic acid. Several molecules showed antinociceptive and local anesthetic properties. The in vitro radioligand binding studies demonstrated that the influence on the sodium and calcium channels may be one of the essential mechanisms of action. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

It is involved in mood disorders and is studied as a target for antidepressants. Here, we report on the structural manipulation of the 5-HT7 receptor ligand 4-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]-1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (1a) aimed at obtaining 5-HT7 receptor ligands endowed with good in vitro metabolic stability. A set of N-[3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl-substituted] 1-arylpiperazine, 4-arylpiperidine and 1-aryl-4-aminopiperidine was synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assays at human cloned 5-HT7 and 5-HT1A receptors. In vitro metabolic stability of the target compounds was assessed after incubation with rat hepatic S9 microsomal fraction. Among the new compounds, 1-(2-biphenyl)-4-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]piperazine (1d) and 4-(2-biphenyl)-1-[2-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]piperidine (2d) showed a good compromise between affinity at 5-HT7 receptor (K (i) = 7.5 nM and 13 nM, respectively) and in vitro metabolic stability (26 and 65 % recovery of parent compound, respectively) but were poorly selective over 5-HT1A receptor.

The abnormal behavior of young influenza patients associated with the use of oseltamivir has developed to a social problem in countries where Tamiflu is often prescribed. It is important to determine the amount of oseltamivir in the brain and to elucidate the relationship between its presence and neuropsychiatric side effects. The aim of this study was to determine the radioactivity in the infant, juvenile and adult rat brains after injection of [C-11]oseltamivir into the rats using PET and autoradiography. After injection of this radioligand, the highest radioactivity was found in the infant brain and the radioactivity level decreased with age. Ex vivo autoradiography on the infant brain displayed a relatively higher radioactivity in the cerebellum than that in the cerebrum. Pretreatment with cyclosporin A (an inhibitor for P-glycoprotein) increased the brain radioactivity. These results give helpful insights into elucidating why the neuropsychiatric side effects of oseltamivir occur in young patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phagocytosis of the apoptotic cells is then facilitated by an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-mediated binding to macrophages surface integrins. The present report describes the synthesis of Tc-99m-HYNIC-lactadherin with a radiochemical yield of 88 +/- 5% (n = 3) and a specific activity of 41 +/- 5 mu Ci/mu g (n = 3) when purified. Purified Tc-99m-HYNIC-lactadherin was shown to be stable for at least 5 h when supplemented with 1.5 mg/ml fatty-acid-free BSA. The radiolabelled protein retained its phospholipid binding ability that was verified by its ability to bind to apoptotic HL60 leukaemia cells. The apoptotic cells demonstrated a RGD independent 3- to 4-fold excess binding of the radioactive component relative to control cells. Surplus of unlabelled lactadherin almost completely inhibited the binding of Tc-99m-HYNIC-lactadherin. Collectively our data indicate that Tc-99m-HYNIC-lactadherin is potentially useful as a new molecular binding tool for the identification of apoptotic cells.

This compound is considered for the noninvasive investigation of the SUR1 receptor status of pancreatic beta-cells by positron emission tomography (PET) in the context of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The specific activity was 40-70GBq/mumol. In vitro testing of the nonradioactive methoxy-repaglinide was performed to characterize the affinity for binding to the human SUR1 isoform. Methoxy-repaglinide induced a complete monophasic inhibition curve with a Hill coefficient close to 1 (1.03) yielding a dissociation constant (K-D) of 83 nM and an IC50 of 163 nM. Insulin secretion experiments on isolated rat islets were performed to prove biological activity, which was determined to be in the same range as that of original repaglinide. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Phthalimido-substituted bis(ammonio)alkane-type modulators belong to the common mode allosteric agents, whereas a physicochemically closely related bispyridinium-oxime with dichlorobenzyl-substituents at both ends is an atypical agent. Here, we compared the actions of stepwise shortened compounds composed of the phthalimido moiety and middle chains of either the bispyridinium- or the bis(ammonio)alkane-type. Allosteric interactions were measured in pig M-2 receptors with the orthosteric probe [H-3]N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) to label the acetylcholine binding site of the receptors. Dissociation and equilibrium binding experiments revealed parallel structure/activity-relationships in both series of compounds with regard to the cooperativity of interaction with [H-3]NMS and to the underlying binding affinities in radioligand-occupied and free receptors. In conclusion, the findings are in line with the hypothesis that the phthalimido-moiety, but not the middle chain, is pivotal for the topology of interaction with the M-2-receptor protein.

The results are consistent with the hypothesis that GBP, PGB, and related substances decrease neocortical NE release by acting at the alpha(2)delta subunit of presynaptic P/Q-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCC) subserving Ca2+ influx in noradrenergic terminals. The inhibitory action appears competitive with [Ca2+](o). and preferential to those neurons undergoing prolonged depolarization. Other results indicate that the reduction of exocytotic NE release is independent of L- and N-type VSCC, classical drug/peptide binding sites on VSCC, Na+ channels, alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, NE transporter, and system L amino acid transporter. These findings suggest a selective modulation of P/Q-type VSCC that are implicated in neurotransmission and several GBP-responsive pathologies.

These well-characterized NCAs and competitive radioligand binding and photolabeling experiments were employed to better characterize the interaction of the dissociative anesthetics ketamine and thienylcycloexylpiperidine (TCP) with the resting AChR. Our experiments yielded what appear to be conflicting results: (i) both ketamine and TCP potentiated [I-125]TID photoincorporation into AChR subunits; and (ii) ketamine and TCP had very little effect on [C-14]amobarbital binding, Nevertheless, (iii) both ketamine and TCP completely displaced [H-3]tetracaine binding (K(i)s similar to 20.9 and 2.0 muM, respectively) by a mutually exclusive mechanism. To reconcile these results we propose that, in the resting ion channel, TCP and ketamine bind to a site that is spatially distinct from the TID and barbiturate locus, while tetracaine bridges both binding sites.

Substantial decreases in the relaxant effect of isoproterenol is observed in uterine rings precontracted with 50 mM KCl from clenbuterol-treated rats. The recovery of the relaxant response was also studied and significant differences were seen between acute and prolonged treatment with clenbuterol (P < 0.05 vs control). In contrast the relaxant effect of forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine was similar in untreated or treated rats. Sodium fluoride also showed a relaxant response which was not affected by the treatment with clenbuterol. The radioligand studies showed a reduction in the number of beta-adrenoreceptors after acute and prolonged treatment with clenbuterol in rat uterus. These results suggest that prolonged treatment with clenbuterol caused a desensitization of the relaxant uterine response through beta(2)-adrenoceptors and also showed differences in the recovery of the relaxant response depending on the duration of treatment.

This report describes a simplified, one-step [F-18]radiofluorination approach using a GE TRACERlab FXFN module for the routine production of this tracer. The one-step synthesis, by [F-18]fluoride displacement of a primary tosylate precursor, gives a six-fold increase in yield over the previous two-step method employing O-alkylation of a phenol precursor with 1,2-[F-18]fluorobromoethane. The average radiochemical yield of [F-18]MK-9470 using the one-step method was 30.3 +/- 11.7% (n=12), with specific activity in excess of 6Ci/mu mol and radiochemical purity of 97.2 +/- 1.5% (n=12), in less than 60min. This simplified, high yielding, automated process was validated for routine GMP production of [F-18]MK-9470 for clinical studies.

One of the heterocyclic salts, compound 7, met the significance criteria in these assays (>50% inhibition) at 10M of the nonselective muscarinic antagonist (H-3-QNB) in cells of the Wistar rat cerebral cortex. Furthermore, this compound displayed 61% inhibition at 10M of the antagonist (H-3-QNB) for the M-5 receptor (IC50 6.34M, K-i 3.93M, n(H)=0.996) in human recombinant CHO cell lines. These data obtained from Ricerca Biosciences suggested that compound 7 was selective for the M-5 receptor. Another study from the Czech Academy of Sciences demonstrated that compound 7 was 3 to 8 times more potent at M-2 than other subtypes of muscarinic receptors in competition with antagonist N-methylscopolamine and selective for the M-1 receptors over M-3 and M-5 in antagonizing accumulation of inositol phosphates induced by muscarinic agonist carbachol.

Molecular Imaging of Conscious, Unrestrained Mice with AwakeSPECT	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						awake; mouse; SPECT; anesthesia; ioflupane	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; HEALTHY-SUBJECTS; ANESTHESIA; PET; MECHANISMS; SPECT	We have developed a SPECT imaging system, AwakeSPECT, to enable molecular brain imaging of untrained mice that are conscious, unanesthetized, and unrestrained. We accomplished this with head tracking and motion correction techniques. Methods: The capability of the system for motion-corrected imaging was demonstrated with a Tc-99m-pertechnetate phantom, Tc-99m-methylene diphosphonate bone imaging, and measurement of the binding potential of the dopamine transporter radioligand I-123-ioflupane in mouse brain in the awake and anesthetized (iso-flurane) states. Stress induced by imaging in the awake state was assessed through measurement of plasma corticosterone levels. Results: AwakeSPECT provided high-resolution bone images reminiscent of those obtained from CT. The binding potential of I-123-ioflupane in the awake state was on the order of 50% of that obtained with the animal under anesthesia, consistent with previous studies in nonhuman primates. Levels of stress induced were on the order of those seen in other behavioral tasks and imaging studies of awake animals. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the feasibility of SPECT molecular brain imaging of mice in the conscious, unrestrained state and demonstrate the effects of isoflurane anesthesia on radiotracer uptake.

Consequently, MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) radiolabeled with positron emitting nuclides (e.g., F-18) represent a suitable tool for the visualization of activated MMPs with PET. On the basis of our previous work and results regarding radiolabeled and unlabeled derivatives of the nonselective MMPIs, we discovered a new class of fluorinated MMPIs with a triazole-substituted hydroxamate substructure. These novel MMPIs are characterized by an increased hydrophilicity compared with the lead structures and excellent MMP inhibition potencies for MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-13 (IC50 = 0.006-107 nM). Therefore, one promising fluorinated triazole-substituted hydroxamate (30b) was selected and resynthesised as its F-18-labeled version to yield the potential PET radioligand [F-18]30b. The biodistribution behavior of this novel compound was investigated with small animal PET.

Using the radioligand binding assay it was demonstrated that both the prodrug par as well as its active metabolite val have a specific affinity to the cannabinoid (CB) receptor measured in CB1-expressing HEK 293 cells and rat brain tissue. Agonist activity was detected by GTP-gamma S assays, cAMP formation experiments and ex vivo modulation of glutamate and GABA release of the rat brain tissue. In comparison to the specific cannabinoid agonist, WIN 55,212-2, the two COX 2 inhibitors are about 2 orders of magnitude less potent. The data suggest that the analgesic effects of par and its metabolite val in Wistar rats may be at least partially mediated by a direct interaction with the CBI receptors. The COX 2 inhibitors appear to be a hypothetically useful tool for add-on therapy of neuropathic pain. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study identified the pharmacological profile of this response. Male Wistar rats were pithed and prepared to stimulate the preganglionic (C-7-T-1) cardiac sympathetic outflow. Intravenous continuous infusions of ergotamine dose-dependently inhibited the tachycardic responses to sympathetic stimulation, but not those to exogenous noradrenaline. Using several antagonists, the sympatho-inhibition to ergotamine was: (1) partially blocked by rauwolscine (alpha(2)), haloperidol (D-1/2-like) or rauwolscine plus GR127935 (5-HT1B/1D); (2) abolished by rauwolscine plus haloperidol; and (3) unaffected by either saline or GR127935. In animals systematically pretreated with haloperidol, this sympatho-inhibition was: (1) unaffected by BRL44408 (alpha(2A)), partially antagonized by MK912 (alpha(2C)); and (3) abolished by BRL44408 plus MK912. These antagonists failed to modify the sympathetically induced tachycardic responses per se. Thus, the cardiac sympatho-inhibition by ergotamine may be mainly mediated by alpha(2A)/alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors, D-2-like receptors and, to a lesser extent, by 5-HT1B/1D receptors.

Each radioligand bound to purified recombinant phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) or to PDE5 in crude extracts with strong affinity, high specificity, slow dissociation, and good stoichiometry. PDE5, the only 3H inhibitor-binding protein detected in extracts, was 15 times higher in lung than in heart extracts, and the level measured by PDE5 catalytic activity agreed with that determined by 3H inhibitor binding. High level of PDE5 in lung approximated that in penile corpus cavernosum, the tissue targeted by PDE5 inhibitors. PDE5 was the predominant cGMP-PDE in lung, and on a molar basis was five times higher than cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), which phosphorylates PDE5 in vivo. The PDE5 level was one-half that of PKG in heart. Thus, abundance of PDE5 in lung vascular smooth muscle provides a strong molecular basis for PDE5 inhibitor treatment of pulmonary hypertension.

IgG from SS and IgG from normal subjects were studied by flow cytometry enzyme immunoassay (ELISA), and radioligand binding assays. By flow cytometric and ELISA procedures, it was shown that IgG from SS patients reacted to cerebral frontal cortex cell surface. SS IgG was able to interact with mAChR by inhibiting H-3-QNB binding to its specific receptor. Besides, SS IgG displayed an agonistic-like activity associated to specific M-1 and M-3 mAChR activation, increasing nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoform activities. Neuronal (n) and endothelial (e) NOS-mRNA gene expression of rat frontal cortex is induced by SS IgG. This article supports the participation of humoral immune alterations in SS, resulting in central parasympathetic functional deregulation. These antibodies alter mAChR activation, NOS activity, and eNOS and nNOS gene expression.

All the derivatives described in this work displayed affinity versus this receptor in the nanomolar range and good selectivity versus A(1) adenosine receptor subtype, confirming that the p-sulfonamido moiety positively affected the activity of the molecules. The best substituents at the sulfonamido nucleus were found to be small alkyl groups, like methyl, isopropyl, ethyl, or allyl moieties (compounds 96-100), whereas monosubstitution at the amino group led to a decrease in A(3) affinity values. The selectivity versus A(1) adenosine receptor subtype is increased when the amino group in the sulfonamido core is represented by a hydrogenated heterocyclic ring like piperidine, morpholine, or pyrroline. Bulky groups, like adamantane and alkyl chains with more than four carbon atoms, are detrimental for the affinity and the selectivity of the A(3) adenosine receptor agonists described here.

These ligands can be regarded as hybrid molecules, consisting of a histamine moiety linked at the two-position of the imidazole ring by a propyl chain to two phenyl rings, one of the characteristic features of several H-1-receptor antagonists. To delineate the binding site of various histaprodifen-like ligands, we generated mutant histamine H-1 receptors, in which various amino acids, involved in the binding of either histamine or H-1-receptor antagonists, were replaced by alanine. Wild-type and mutant H-1 receptors were transiently expressed in African green monkey kidney cells (COS-7) and evaluated for their interaction with histamine and various histaprodifens by [H-3]mepyramine radioligand-binding studies and by nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) reporter-gene assays. Our data show that, within the histamine H-1-receptor binding pocket, histaprodifens interact with both agonist and antagonist binding sites, resulting in high affinity histamine H-1-receptor agonists.

We determined the density and affinity of the beta-adrenergic receptors in the left ventricle of cold-, heat-, and normothermic-acclimated pigeons by radioligand binding techniques. The mechanical performance of the left ventricle of the heart subjected to either isoproterenol or Ca2+ loading was measured using the Langendorff perfusion system. Heat- and cold-acclimated hearts demonstrated a significant downregulation of beta- and beta(2)-adrenoreceptor density accompanied by an increase in their affinity when compared with normothermic-acclimated hearts. In agreement with these results, isoproterenol improved cardiac performance in cold- and heat-acclimated hearts. We also found that the heat-acclimated hearts were capable of functioning successfully when exposed to high Ca2+ loads, whereas cold-acclimated hearts were significantly less tolerant of Ca2+ loads and less efficient. Thermal acclimation induces cellular alterations in the pigeon heart, thus enabling better coping with hemodynamic and calcium loads, both resulting from thermal stress.

The present studies evaluated the effects of GR89,696 in vitro {i.e., in radioligand binding and [S-35]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate assays} and in vivo in rhesus monkeys, in assays used to study kappa -opioid agonists (i.e., thermal anti nociception, sedation and muscle relaxation, diuresis, and increases in serum prolactin levels, as well as ethylketocyclazocine and U69,593 discrimination). Furthermore, the sensitivity of GR89,696 to naltrexone and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) antagonism was compared with that of U50,488 and U69,593, ligands selective for the proposed "kappa (1)" subtype. Overall, GR89,696 displayed the profile of a highly potent kappa -opioid agonist, following parenteral administration in rhesus monkeys. GR89,696 was less sensitive than U50,488 and U69,593 to naltrexone or nor-BNI antagonism, consistent with an action through the proposed kappa (2) receptor subtype.

These centers are activated by information from the periphery and supraspinal nuclei so as to elicit penile erection in a variety of physiological contexts. A small number of nuclei including the locus coeruleus located in the pens sends noradrenergic fibers to the forebrain and spinal cord, including those areas controlling penile erection. Recent morphological techniques such as in situ hybridization and autoradiography using radioligand binding permit investigation of the brain and spinal pathways utilizing alpha adrenoceptor subtypes. Furthermore, pharmacological experiments suggest a modulatory role for noradrenaline in the control of penile erection either in the brain or in the spinal cord. The most robust evidence is that central inhibition of alpha-2 adrenoceptors facilitates sexual function. Taken together, the data propose new directions in the physiological exploration of penile erection and the therapeutic approach of erectile dysfunction.

In clinical routine, the total tumor volume (TTV) on PSMA PET impacts therapy outcomes and plays an increasing role in mCRPC patients. Hence, we aimed to assess TTV and its changes during Ac-225-PSMA-I&T RLT. Methods: mCRPC patients undergoing RLT with Ac-225-PSMA-I&T with available F-18-PSMA-1007 PET/CT prior to therapy initiation were included. TTV was assessed in all patients using established cut-off values. Image derived, clinical and biochemistry parameters (PSA, LDH, AP, pain score) were analyzed prior to and after two cycles of Ac-225-PSMA. Changes in TTV and further parameters were directly compared and then correlated with established response criteria, such as RECIST 1.1 or mPERCIST. Results: 13 mCRPC patients were included. The median overall survival (OS) was 10 months. Prior to Ac-225-PSMA RLT, there was no significant correlation between TTV with other clinical parameters (p > 0.05 each). Between short-term survivors (STS, <10 months OS) and long-term survivors (LTS, >= 10 months OS), TTV and PSA were comparable (p = 0.592 & p = 0.286, respectively), whereas AP was significantly lower in the LTS (p = 0.029). A total of 7/13 patients completed two cycles and underwent a follow-up F-18-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. Among these patients, there was a significant decrease in TTV (median 835 vs. 201 mL, p = 0.028) and PSA (median 687 ng/dL vs. 178 ng/dL, p = 0.018) after two cycles of Ac-225-PSMA RLT. Here, percentage changes of TTV after two cycles showed no direct correlation to all other clinical parameters (p > 0.05 each). In two patients, new PET-avid lesions were detected on F-18-PSMA-1007 PET/CT. However, TTV and PSA were decreasing or stable. Conclusion: PET-derived assessment of TTV is an easily applicable imaging biomarker independent of other established parameters prior to Ac-225-PSMA RLT in these preliminary follow-up data. Even after the failure of Lu-177-PSMA, patients with extensive TTV seem to profit from RLT. All but one patient who was eligible for >= 2 cycles of Ac-225-PSMA-RLT demonstrated drastic TTV decreases without direct correlation to other biomarkers, such as serum PSA changes. Changes in TTV might hence improve the response assessment compared to standard classifiers by reflecting the current tumor load independent of the occurrence of new lesions.

The aim of this study was to examine the suitability of F-18-FE-PE2I as a tool for imaging the nigrostriatal pathway in Parkinson disease (PD) with PET. Methods: Ten PD patients (9 men and 1 woman; mean age +/- SD, 60 +/- 9 y; Hoehn and Yahr, 1-2; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale motor, 18.9 +/- 6.7) and 10 controls (9 men and 1 woman; mean age +/- SD, 60 +/- 7 y) were included. PET measurements with F-18-FE-PE2I were conducted for 93 min using the High-Resolution Research Tomograph. Venous blood was drawn to compare protein binding, parent fraction, and radiometabolite composition in PD patients and controls. Regions of interest for the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum, SN, and cerebellum were drawn on coregistered MR images. The outcome measure was the binding potential (BPND) estimated with the simplified reference tissue model and the Logan graphical analysis, using the cerebellum as a reference region. Time stability of BPND was examined to define the shortest acquisition protocol for quantitative studies. The wavelet-aided parametric imaging method was used to obtain high-resolution BPND images to compare DAT availability in the striatum and SN in PD patients and control subjects. Group differences were assessed with the unpaired t test (P < 0.05). Results: Parent, radiometabolite fractions, plasma concentration, and cerebellar uptake of F-18-FE-PE2I did not differ significantly between PD patients and controls. Stable estimates of BPND (<8% of the 93-min value) were obtained with the simplified reference tissue model using approximately 66 min of data. BPND values in PD patients were significantly lower than those in controls (P < 0.05) in the caudate (2.54 +/- 0.79 vs. 3.68 +/- 0.56), putamen (1.39 +/- 1.04 vs. 4.41 +/- 0.54), ventral striatum (2.26 +/- 0.93 vs. 3.30 +/- 0.46), and SN (0.46 +/- 0.20 vs. 0.68 +/- 0.15). Conclusion: F-18-FE-PE2I is clearly a suitable radioligand for DAT quantification and imaging of the nigrostriatal pathway in PD. Similar metabolism in controls and PD patients, suitability of the cerebellum as a reference region, and accuracy of quantification using approximately 66 min of PET data are advantages for noninvasive and simplified imaging protocols for PD studies. Finally, DAT loss in PD can be measured in both the striatum and the SN, supporting the utility of F-18-FEPE2I as an imaging tool of the nigrostriatal pathway.

The structure- activity relationships (SAR) of the xanthines synthesized in binding to recombinant human A(2B) adenosine receptors (ARs) in HEK-293 cells (HEK-A(2B)) and at other AR subtypes were explored. The synthesized compounds showed A(2B) adenosine receptor affinity in the nanomolar range and good levels of selectivity evaluated in radioligand binding assays at human (h) A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) ARs. We introduced several heterocycles, such as pyrazole, isoxazole, pyridine, and pyridazine, at the 8-position of the xanthine nucleus and we have also investigated different spacers (substituted acetamide, oxyacetamide, and urea moieties) on the heterocycle introduced. Various groups at the 3- and 4-positions of phenylacetamide moiety were studied. This study allowed us to identify the derivatives 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[5-(2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]acetamide (29b, MRE2028F20) [K-i(hA(2B)) = 38 nM, K-i(hA(1),hA(2A),hA(3)) > 1000 nM], N-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-2-[5-(2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yloxy]acetamide (62b, MRE2029F20) [K-i(hA(2B)) = 5.5 nM, K-i(hA(1),hA(2A),hA(3)) > 1000 nM], and N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-[5-(2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yloxy]acetamide (72b, MRE2030F20) [K-i(hA(2B) = 12 nM, K-i(hA(1)hA(2A),hA(3)) > 1000 nM], which showed high affinity at the A(2B) receptor subtype and very good selectivity vs the other ARs. Substitution of the acetamide with an urea moiety afforded bioisosteric xanthines with good affinity and selectivity comparable to the acetamide derivatives. Substitution at the para-position of a 4-benzyloxy group of the phenylacetamido chain enhanced affinity at the A(2B) receptor [compound 30b (K-i(hA(2B)) = 13 nM) vs compound 21b (K-i(hA(2B) = 56 nM)] but did not favor selectivity. The derivatives with higher affinity at human A(2B) AR proved to be antagonists, in the cyclic AMP assay, capable of inhibiting the stimulatory effect of NECA (100 nM) with IC50 values in the nanomolar range, a trend similar to that observed in the binding assay (62b, IC50 = 38 nM; 72b, IC50 = 46 nM). In conclusion, the 8-pyrazolo-1,3-dipropyl-1H-purine-2,6-dione derivatives described herein represent a new family of selective antagonists for the adenosine A(2B) receptor.

This radioisotope is obtained by two different production routes that directly affect the specific activity of lutetium-177 (non-carrier added and carrier added) and, consequently, the specific activity of radiopharmaceuticals, like Lu-177-PSMA-617. The influence of the specific activity of lutetium-177 on the properties of the radiopharmaceutical PSMA-617 was evaluated through preclinical studies. The in vitro study pointed to a lower constant of dissociation with non-carrier added lutetium-177 due to the difference in the specific activity. However, competition and internalization assays resulted in similar results for both lutetium-177. Based on these pre-clinical experiments, the total in vitro tumor cell binding and tumor uptake in vivo were similar, with no influence of the specific activity of the Lu-177-PSMA-617. Regardless the specific activity did not directly affect tumor uptake, the tumor/non-target organs ratios were higher for the radiopharmaceutical labeled with carrier added lutetium-177, which had the lowest specific activity.

Here, we synthesized a novel compound 4-(6-fluoro-4-(5-isopropoxy-1H-indazol-3-yl)pyridin-2-yl)morpholine (FIPM) and labeled it with fluorine-18 (F-18), to develop a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer forin vivovisualization of LRRK2 in the brain. FIPM showed highin vitrobinding affinity for LRRK2 (IC50= 8.0 nM). [F-18]FIPM was prepared in 5% radiochemical yield (n= 5), by inserting(18)F into a pyridine ring, followed by removal of the protecting group. After HPLC separation and formulation, [F-18]FIPM was acquired with >97% radiochemical purity and 103-300 GBq mu mol(-1)of molar activity at the end of radiosynthesis. Biodistribution and small-animal PET studies in mice indicated a lowin vivospecific binding of [F-18]FIPM. While [F-18]FIPM presented limited potential as anin vivoPET tracer for LRRK2, we suggested that it can be used as a lead compound for developing new radiotracers with improvedin vivobrain properties.

Ongoing studies of F-18-Mefway have shown it to be an effective PET radiotracer. We have synthesized isomers of Mefway by changing the position of the methyl group in attempts to evaluate stability for imaging purposes. 2-Methyl-, 3-methyl-, and 4-methyl-cyclohexane-1-carboxylic acids and 3-carbomethoxy-, 4-carbomethoxycyclohexane-1-carboxylic acids were coupled with WAY-100634 to provide the methylcyclohexyl derivatives (2-, 3-, and 4-methyl). Mefway and 3-Mefway analogs were prepared by reduction of carbomethoxy- derivatives followed by fluorination. In vitro binding affinities for the methylated derivatives in rat brain homogenates were found to be 10.4 nM (2-methyl), 77 nM (3-methyl), and 21.5 nM (4-methyl). Binding affinity of 3-Mefway and 4-Mefway was found to be 17.4 nM and 6.26 nM, respectively. Our results suggest that 3-methyl/3-fluoromethyl substituent has approx. threefold lower affinities compared to the 4-methyl/4-fluoromethyl substituent.

In vitro binding studies using A beta(1-40) aggregates with [I-125]IMPY as the reference ligand showed that these compounds demonstrated high to low binding affinities at the K-i values ranged from 9.10 to 432.03 nM, depending on the substitution of the phenyl ring. Fluorescent staining in vitro indicated that one compound with a N,N-dimethylamino group intensely stained A beta plaques within brain sections of postmortem AD patients. Biodistribution studies in normal mice after i.v. injection of the radioiodinated homoisoflavonoid displayed good initial brain uptake (2.61% ID/g at 2 min post-injection) and rapid clearance from the brain (0.18% ID/g at 60 min), which is desirable for amyloid imaging agents. The results strongly suggest that these derivatives are worthy of further study and may be useful amyloid imaging agents for early detection of amyloid plaques in the brain of AD.

The aim of this PET study was to examine and compare the availability of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1B)-receptor subtype in patients with PD and age-matched control subjects. Twelve control subjects and 12 PD patients were examined with PET using the 5-HT1B-radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369. In PD patients, 5-HT1B-receptor availability in the right orbitofrontal cortex was lower than in control subjects. A statistically significant negative correlation between 5-HT1B-receptor availability and age was obtained for the right temporal cortex in control subjects and for the right midbrain and left parahippocampal gyrus in PD patients. The lower regional 5-HT1B-receptor availability is in line with previous studies showing a decrease of serotonin imaging markers in PD and corroborates a role of the serotonin system in the pathophysiology of PD. The demonstrated age effect on 5-HT1B receptors suggest a physiologic and PD-related decline of serotonin function, indicating the importance of controlling for age in clinical studies.

The metabolic stability and high affinity of [H-3]AL-11 for catalytically active IRAP allowed its detection in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cell membranes in the absence of chelators (Demaegdt et al., 2009). Here, we show that, contrary to [H-3]Ang IV, [H-3]AL-11 displays high affinity and specificity for IRAP in intact CHO-K1 cells as well. After binding to IRAP at the surface, [H-3]AL-11 is effectively internalized by an endocytotic process. Unexpectedly, surface binding and internalization of [H-3]AL-11 was not affected by pretreating the cells with Ang IV but declined with AL-11. In the latter case surface expression of IRAP even increased. After elimination of simpler explanations, it is proposed that metabolically stable "AT(4)-receptor" ligands undergo semi-continuous cycling between the cell surface and endosomal compartments. The in vivo efficacy of stable and unstable "AT4-receptor" ligands could therefore differ. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using radioligand binding assays and real-time polymerase chain reaction, the densities of binding sites and mRNA levels of M-2, M-3, alpha(2AD)- and beta(2)-AR were compared in muscle tissues from the abomasal fundus, pylorus, duodenum, caecum, and external loop of the spiral colon of eight cows with left displacement of abomasum (LDA), and of eight healthy cows. Specific binding of the [H-3]-ligands to each of the four receptors was competitive and saturable. Binding sites of M-2 (all intestinal sites), M-3 (duodenum and caecum), and of alpha(2AD)-AR (abomasal fundus) were lower (P < 0.05) in cows with LDA than in healthy cows. The coefficients of correlation between binding sites and mRNA transcripts of receptors were dissimilar in cows with LDA and healthy cows. The decrease in densities of M (intestine) and of alpha(2AD)-AR (abomasum) receptors suggests their implication in the impairment of motility associated with or leading to LDA. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Objectives: To examine exposure to BDV or a related virus in Japanese psychiatric and general population by detecting the specific IgG, IgM, and IgA. Study design: Sera from 304 psychiatric and 378 control Subjects were examined for IgG, IgM, and IgA against BDV nucleoprotein (N) and phosphoprotein (P) using highly specific and sensitive radioligand assay. The avidity was also examined. Results: The specific IgG, IgM, and IgA against both BDV-N and -P were detected and the seropositivity was not significantly different between patients and controls. The avidity of the specific IgG was low to moderate, and the specific IgM did not disappear for several years. Conclusions: Our results Suggested common exposure to BDV or a related virus in the general Japanese population. Low avidity IgG and persistent IgM suggested delayed immune response against BDV or a related virus. The specific IgA indicated mucosal involvement. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To make comparisons between mammalian and Xenopus oocyte expression systems, it would be advantageous to use a single vector without the need for shuttle vectors or subcloning. We have designed such a vector, designated pUNIV for universal, with elements that will allow for in vitro or ex vivo expression in multiple cell types. We tested the expression of pUNIV-based cDNA cassettes using enhanced green fluorescent protein and two forms of the type A gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R) and compared pUNIV to vectors optimized for expression in either Xenopus oocytes or mammalian cells. In HEK293 cells, radioligand binding was robust, and patch clamp experiments showed that subtle macroscopic GABA(A)R kinetics were indistinguishable from our previous results. In Xenopus oocytes, agonist median effective concentration measurements matched previous work using a vector optimized for oocyte expression. Furthermore, we found that expression using pUNIV was significantly enhanced in oocytes and was remarkably long-lasting in both systems.

In pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy, there is downregulation of G protein-coupled receptors and the appearance of a densified microtubule network extensively decorated by a microtubule-associated protein, MAP 4. Our hypothesis is that overdecoration of a dense microtubule network with this structural protein, as in hypertrophied myocardium, would impede receptor recovery. We tested this hypothesis by studying muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) internalization and recovery after agonist stimulation in neuroblastoma cells. Exposure of cells to carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist, decreased membrane receptor binding activity. After carbachol withdrawal, receptor binding recovered toward the initial value. When microtubules were depolymerized before carbachol withdrawal, mAChR recovery was only 44% of that in intact cells. Cells were then infected with an adenovirus containing MAP 4 cDNA. MAP 4 protein decorated the microtubules extensively, and receptor recovery upon carbachol withdrawal was reduced to 54% of control. Thus muscarinic receptor recovery after agonist exposure is microtubule dependent, and MAP 4 decoration of microtubules inhibits receptor recovery.

Synthetic forms of mu-conotoxins PIIIA and PIIIA42-22) were found to inhibit tetrodotoxin (TTX)-sensitive VSSC current but had little effect on TTX-resistant VSSC current in sensory ganglion neurons. In rat brain neurons, these peptides preferentially inhibited the persistent over the transient VSSC current. Radioligand binding assays revealed that PIIIA PIIIA-(2-22), and mu-conotoxin GIIIB discriminated among TTX-sensitive VSSCs in rat brain, that these and GIIIC discriminated among the corresponding VSSCs in human brain, and GIIIA had low affinity for neuronal VSSCs. H-1 NMR studies found that PIIIA adopts two conformations in solution due to cis/trans isomerization at hydroxyproline 8. The major trans conformation results in a three-dimensional structure that is significantly different from the previously identified conformation of mu-conotoxins GIIIA and GIIIB that selectively target TTX-sensitive muscle VSSCs. Comparison of the structures and activity of PIIIA to muscle-selective mu-conotoxins provides an insight into the structural requirements for inhibition of different TTX-sensitive sodium channels by mu-conotoxins.

In this preliminary study we examined in vivo mu opioid receptor (mu OR) binding in three healthy opioid-dependent volunteers during maintenance on 2 and 16 mg sublingual buprenorphine (BUP) liquid, and after detoxification (0 mg) under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions, and once in matched controls. Binding measures were obtained with the mu OR-selective radioligand [C-11]carfentanil (CFN) and PET 4 hrs after BUP administration. BUP induced dose-dependent reductions in mu OR availability, 36-50% at 2 mg and 79-95% at 16 mg relative to placebo. Heroin abusers also had greater mu OR binding potential in the inferofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate regions during placebo, compared to matched controls. Further studies are warranted to examine the relationship of mu OR availability with BUP therapeutic actions, and the clinical implications of increased mu OR binding during withdrawal.

To synthesize new agonist ligands for hCB1R, we have designed different classes of photoswitchable molecules based on an indole core. The modifications made to the central core have allowed us to understand the molecular characteristics necessary to design an agonist with optimal pharmacological properties. Compound 27a shows high affinity for CB1R (K-i(cis-form) = 0.18 mu M), with a marked difference in affinity with respect to its inactive "trans-off " form (CB1R Kitrans/cis ratio = 5.4). The novel compounds were evaluated by radioligand binding studies, receptor internalization, sensor receptor activation (GRABeCB2.0), Western blots for analysis of ERK1/2 activation, NanoBiT beta arr2 recruitment, and calcium mobilization assays, respectively. The data show that the novel agonist 27a is a candidate for studying the optical modulation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs), serving as a new molecular tool for investigating the involvement of hCB(1)R in disorders associated with the endocannabinoid system.

In Vivo Profiling with <SUP>18</SUP>F-YJH08 Reveals Diverse Tissue Patterns of Antagonist/Glucocorticoid Receptor Interactions	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						pharmacodynamics; prostate cancer; target engagement; therapeutic index	ANTAGONIST CORT125281	Demonstrating target engagement in vivo is an important milestone in drug development, both to establish on target, on tissue interactions but also to identify potentially undesirable off tissue binding. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a long-studied yet vexing drug target that has recently re-emerged as a potential druggable driver of many solid tumor types including breast and prostate cancer, and several antagonists are currently in early phase clinical trials. Since GR is also ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues, understanding antagonist/GR interactions in normal tissues and tumor is crucial to defining a therapeutic index. Herein, we demonstrate that the GR radioligand F-18-YJH08 can map drug/GR engagement in vivo. Profiling target engagement in vivo showed that the GR antagonists RU486 (mifepristone) and CORT125281 engaged GR in fewer normal tissues compared to ORIC-101 or the agonist dexamethasone. Furthermore, F-18-YJH08 detected GR in human prostate cancer tumor models and measured receptor binding by RU486. In summary, these data show for the first time that antagonist/GR interactions can be measured in vivo with 18FYJH08, a finding with clinical relevance as GR antagonists and 1(1)C-YJH08 are currently in clinical trials.

PET radioligand injection for pig neuroimaging	SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE			English	Article							PORCINE BRAIN; METABOLISM; BLOOD	Pigs are useful models in neuroimaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET). Radiolabeled ligands are injected intravenously at the start of the scan and in pigs the most easily accessible route of administration is the ear vein. However, in brain studies the short distance between the brain and ear vein can be problematic as both are localized inside the field of view and, as a consequence, tracer residues in the catheter may influence the outcome of the scan. Here, we discuss options to avoid this problem. The femoral vein can be used in studies where repeated arterial blood sampling is needed because surgical incision has to be performed to allow access to the artery. When a non-invasive technique is preferred, the ear vein is a good alternative although it is recommended to dilute the tracer sufficiently in saline (20-50 mL) prior to injection. In addition, the tracer can be injected through an extension tube (filled with saline before injection), which is removed together with the syringe immediately aft er tracer injection. This avoids placing the syringe with tracer inside the PET gantry while injecting. By applying these simple techniques, it is our experience that it is possible to obtain high-quality images without exposing pigs to invasive procedures.	[Alstrup, Aage K.

This paper addresses whether the availability of 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1B (5-HT1B) is seen to decrease with aging via PET imaging. Methods: Forty-eight healthy control subjects (mean age +/- SD, 30 +/- 10 y; age range, 18-61 y; 33 men, 15 women) underwent C-11-P943 scanning on a high-resolution PET tomograph. Regions were examined with and without gray matter masking, the latter in an attempt to control for age-related gray matter atrophy on nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) as determined by a validated multilinear reference tissue model. Results: 5-HT1B BPND decreased in the cortex at an average rate of 8% per decade without and 9% with gray matter masking. A negative association with age was also observed in all individual cortical regions. Differences in the putamen and pallidum (positive association) were significant after adjustment for multiple comparisons. No sex- or race-related effects on 5-HT1B BPND were found in any regions. Conclusion: These findings indicate that age is a relevant factor for 5-HT1B in the cortex of healthy adults.

Application to tie Design of Potent Thromboxane (A2) Receptor Antagonists	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DRUG DESIGN; TETRAZOLE; ANALOGS	Cyclopentane-1,3-diones are known to exhibit pK(a) values typically in the range of carboxylic acids. To explore the potential of the cyclopentane-1,3-dione unit as a carboxylic acid isostere, the physical chemical properties of representative congeners were examined and compared with similar derivatives bearing carboxylic acid or tetrazole residues. These studies suggest that cyclopentane-1,3-diones may effectively substitute for the carboxylic acid functional group. To demonstrate the use of the cyclopentane-1,3-dione isostere in drug design, derivatives of a known thromboxane A(2) prostanoid (TP) receptor antagonist, 3-(3-(2-(4-chlorophenylsulfonamido)ethyl)phenyl)propanoic acid (12), were synthesized and evaluated in both functional and radioligand-binding assays. A series of mono- and disubstituted cyclopentane-1,3-dione derivatives (41-45) were identified that exhibit nanomolar IC50 and K-d values similar to 12. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that the cyclopentane-1,3-dione moiety comprises a novel isostere of the carboxylic acid functional group. Given the combination of the relatively strong acidity, tunable lipophilicity, and versatility of the structure, the cyclopentane-1,3-dione moiety may constitute a valuable addition to the palette of carboxylic acid isosteres.

A structure-activity relationship study was performed to pinpoint residues conferring aSVG's selectivity. The aSVG-analogues being N-terminally extended by one or two residues or containing the Ala(22)Arg(23)Ala(24) (ARA-motif) of CRF, were synthesized. Additionally, a lactam bridge between positions 29 and 32 was introduced. The modified peptides were analyzed for alpha-helicity properties, binding affinities and antagonistic potencies at the rat CRF1 and mouse CRF2B receptors. While N-terminal prolongation and replacement Of D-Phe(11) by Tyr(11) increased the affinity for the CRF2 receptor, the introduction of the ARA motif resulted in a loss of CRF2 receptor selectivity. These data show that aSVG(10-40) analogues are more potent CRF2 receptor antagonists than aSVG(11-40) peptides, while introduction of the ARA-motif or a cyclic constraint between residues 29 and 32 favors binding to the CRF1 receptor.

Background.-Frovatriptan is a new 5-HT1B/1D agonist developed for the treatment of migraine. Methods.-Pharmacological studies were performed using in vitro and in vivo techniques. Results.-Radioligand-binding studies showed that frovatriptan has a high affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, and moderate affinity for 5-HT1A , 5-HT1F , and 5-HT7 receptors. In vitro, frovatriptan acts as a potent full agonist at human cloned 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, and as a moderately potent full agonist at 5-HT7 receptors. Studies of frovatriptan in isolated human arteries demonstrated a lower threshold for constriction of cerebral than coronary vasculature and a bell-shaped dose-response curve was apparent in the coronary arteries. In anesthetized dogs, frovatriptan administration produced no measurable effect on cardiac function or on blood pressure. Frovatriptan had no effects on coronary blood flow following transient coronary artery occlusion, whereas sumatriptan produced a prolonged and significant decrease in coronary blood flow. Conclusion.-The pharmacology of frovatriptan suggests that it should be an effective agent for the acute treatment of migraine, with a low potential for undesirable peripheral effects.

Human subcutaneous adipose tissue explants were cultured for 48 h in the presence of 100 muM bromopalmitate (BrPal), and lipolysis was measured in isolated adipocytes. In control conditions, beta-AR-dependent activation of lipolysis by epinephrine was almost undetectable, and could be fully restored by pharmacological blockade of alpha2-AR-dependent antilipolysis. After BrPal treatment, epinephrine became fully lipolytic and was no longer influenced by alpha2-AR-blockade. Radioligand binding analysis revealed that BrPal treatment led to a significant reduction in the coupling of alpha2-AR to G proteins. In parallel, a chronic and significant increase in plasma fatty acids resulting from a 4-day high-fat diet (HFD) was accompanied by an impairment of the amplifying effect of the alpha2-AR antagonist phentolamine on exercise-induced lipolysis (measured in the subcutaneous adipose tissue with the use of a microdialysis probe) normally observed after a low-fat diet. In conclusion, in vitro and in vivo studies showed that fatty acids impair alpha2-AR-dependent antilipolysis.

We have compared receptor binding affinity and functional activity for a series of agonists and antagonists. 2 The chimeric G-protein, G(qi5), was used to couple receptor activation to increases in intracellular calcium for functional studies on the Fluorimetric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR), using a stable GABA(B1)/GABA(B2)/G(qi5) CHO cell line. [H-3]-CGP-54626 was used in radioligand binding studies in membranes prepared from the same cell line. 3 The pharmacological profile of the recombinant GABA(B1/B2) receptor was consistent with that of native GABAB receptors in that it was activated by GABA and baclofen and inhibited by CGP-54626A and SCH 50911. 4 Unlike native receptors, the GABA(B1)/GABA(B2)/G(qi5) response was not inhibited by high microMolar concentration of phaclofen, saclofen or CGP 35348. 5 This raises the possibility that the GABA(B1)/GABA(B2)/G(qi5) recombinant receptor may represent the previously described GABAB receptor subtype which is relatively resistant to inhibition by phaclofen.

The in vitro affinity and potency values of L-Trp and L-Phe are within the physiological concentration ranges of L-Trp and L-Phe. A recent paper suggests that adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a and b melanocyte stimulating hormones (alpha-MSH and beta-MSH) and derivatives a-MSH1 9/a-MSH1 10 can also activate GPR139 in vitro. We tested this hypothesis using guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35] thio)-triphosphate binding (GTP gamma S), calcium mobilization and [H-3] JNJ-63533054 radioligand binding assays. In the GTP gamma S binding assay, alpha-MSH, alpha-MSH1 9/alpha-MSH1 10, and beta-MSH had no effect on [S-35] GTP gamma S incorporation in cell membranes expressing GPR139 up to 30 m M in contrast to the concentration dependent activation produced by L-Trp, JNJ-63533054, and TC-09311 (two small molecule GPR139 agonists). ACTH slightly decreased the basal level of [S-35] GTP gamma S incorporation at 30 m M. In the GPR139 radioligand binding assay, a moderate displacement of [H-3] JNJ-63533054 binding by ACTH and b-MSH was observed at 30 m M (40 and 30%, respectively); alpha-MSH, alpha-MSH1 9/alpha-MSH1 10 did not displace any specific binding at 30 m M. In three different host cell lines stably expressing GPR139, alpha-MSH, and beta-MSH did not stimulate calcium mobilization in contrast to L-Trp, JNJ-63533054, and TC-09311. ACTH, alpha-MSH1 9/alpha-MSH1 10 only weakly stimulated calcium mobilization at 30 m M (< 50% of EC100). We then co-transfected GPR139 with the three melanocortin (MC) receptors (MC3R, MC4R, and MC5R) to test the hypothesis that ACTH, alpha-MSH, and b-MSH might stimulate calcium mobilization through a MCR/GPR139 interaction. All three MC peptides stimulated calcium response in cells co-transfected with GPR139 and MC3R, MC4R, or MC5R. The MC peptides did not stimulate calcium response in cells expressing MC3R or MC5R alone consistent with the Gs signaling transduction pathway of these receptors. In agreement with the previously reported multiple signaling pathways of MC4R, including Gq transduction pathway, the MC peptides produced a calcium response in cells expressing MC4R alone. Together, our findings do not support that GPR139 is activated by ACTH, alpha-MSH, and beta-MSH at physiologically relevant concentration but we did unravel an in vitro interaction between GPR139 and the MCRs.

Pharmacological characterisation of the GlyT-1 glycine transporter using two novel radioligands	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Glycine transporter; GlyT-1; Radioligand binding; Rat brain; Human brain	NMDA RECEPTOR; SELECTIVE INHIBITOR; D-SERINE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SITE; GLYCINE-TRANSPORTER-1; NEUROTRANSMISSION; MODULATION; PROFILES; BINDING	Inhibitors of the glycine transporter GlyT-1 are being developed as potential treatments for schizophrenia. Here we report on the use of two novel radioligands, [(3)H]-SB-733993 and [(3)H]-GSK931145, for the characterisation of GlyT-1 in both cells and native tissue. Binding was evaluated in membranes either from HEK293 cells expressing recombinant human GlyT-1 (hGlyT-1) or from rat cerebral cortex. Specific binding of both [(3)H]-SB-733993 and [(3)H]-GSK931145 to hGlyT-1 HEK293 cell membranes and rat cerebral cortex membranes was saturable and comprised >90% of total binding. IQ and B(max) values for the two radioligands were fairly similar, with K(d) values of 1-2 nM and B(max) values of around 7000 fmol/mg protein in hGlyT-1 membranes and 3000 fmol/mg protein in rat cortex membranes. Association of [(3)H]-SB-733993 was faster, with binding reaching equilibrium within 30 min compared with 90 min for [(3)H]-GSK931145. Dissociation was also much slower for [(3)H]-GSK931145 than for [(3)H]-SB-733993, with 50% of specific binding being dissociated by approximately 40 min and 5 min, respectively. Autoradiography studies with [(3)H]-GSK931145 showed widespread distribution of binding in rat brain, with generally higher binding in caudal compared with rostral areas. Initial studies in human frontal cortex membranes showed clear specific binding of [(3)H]-GSK931145, though with much lower density (B(max) 570 fmol/mg protein) and slightly lower affinity (Kd 4.5 nM) compared with rat cortex. A human brain autoradiography study showed higher specific binding in cerebellum compared with frontal cortex. All GlyT-1 inhibitors tested, as well as glycine itself, competed fully for the binding of both [3H]-SB-733993 and [(3)H]-GSK931145 in both hGlyT-1 and rat cortex membranes. Studies on the effect of varying NaCl concentration showed that [(3)H]-SB-733993 binding was reduced by >90% in the absence of added Na(+) ions, whilst [(3)H]-GSK931145 binding was unaffected. Glycine produced concentration-dependent decreases in binding affinity of both radioligands without major changes in B(max) values, suggesting that both [(3)H]-SB-733993 and [(3)H)-GSK931145 bind to sites on GlyT-1 that are orthosteric to the site at which glycine itself binds. Overall, these results show that both [(3)H]-SB-733993 and [(3)H]-GSK931145 are useful radioligands for studies on GlyT-1 in both cell lines and native tissues, with [(3)H]-GSK931145 being the radioligand of choice for further studies on GlyT-1 expression and pharmacology.

To do that, the phenyl ring in the N-substituent of our lead compound LP1 was replaced by an electron-rich or electron-deficient ring and linked through a propanamide or butyramide spacer at the basic nitrogen of the (-)-cis-N-normetazocine skeleton. In radioligand binding assays, compounds 3 and 7 were found to display nanomolar binding affinity for the mu opioid receptor (MOR) (K-i = 5.96 +/- 0.08 nM and 1.49 +/- 0.24 nM, respectively). In the mouse vas deferens (MVD) assay, compound 3 showed an antagonist effect against DAMGO ([D-Ala(2), N-MePhe(4), Gly-ol]-enkephalin), a highly selective MOR prototype agonist, whereas compound 7 produced naloxone reversible effect at MOR. Moreover, compound 7, as potent as LP1 and DAMGO at MOR, was able to reduce thermal and inflammatory pain assessed by the mouse tail-flick test and rat paw pressure thresholds (PPTs) measured by a Randall-Selitto test.

However, the identification of such biased ligands as drug candidates is highly desirable. Here, we report that Higenamine, a compound isolated from a Chinese herb, functions as a novel beta-arrestin-biased ligand of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR). The radioligand binding assays demonstrated that Higenamine was the ligand of beta(2)-AR. Higenamine induced phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), which can be blocked by propranolol, an inhibitor of beta(2)-AR. The Gi protein inhibitor, pertussis toxin, had no effect on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by Higenamine. Furthermore, Higenamine induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation through transactivation of Epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR). We also found that Higenamine-induced-ERK1/2 phosphorylation is dependent on beta-arrestin1/2, and HG inhibits Doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Our results identify Higenamine as a novel biased ligand via the beta-arrestin-dependent pathway. These findings give us a better understanding of Higenamine's potential role in designing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

In this paper we examine how affinity for the 5-HT2A/2C receptors are influenced by N-benzyl substitution of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine derivatives. Special attention is given to the 2' and 3'-position of the N-benzyl as such compounds are known to be very potent. We found that substitutions in these positions are generally well tolerated. The 2'-position was further examined using a range of substituents to probe the hydrogen bonding requirements for optimal affinity and selectivity, and it was found that small changes in the ligands in this area had a profound effect on their affinities. Furthermore, two ligands that lack a 2'-benzyl substituent were also found to have high affinity contradicting previous held notions. Several high-affinity ligands were identified and assayed for functional activity at the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor, and they were generally found to be less efficacious agonists than previously reported N-benzyl phenethylamines.

As these tracers accumulate in the basal ganglia (BG) with high affinity and long residence times, radiation dose to the BG may become significant, especially in normal control subjects. We have performed dynamic PET measurements using F-18-FPCIT in 16 normal adult subjects to determine if in fact the BG, although not a whole organ, but a well-defined substructure, receives the highest dose. Regions of interest were drawn over left and right BG structures. Resultant time-activity curves were generated and used to determine residence times for dosimetry calculations. S-factors were computed using the MIRDOSE3 nodule model for each caudate and putamen. For F-18-FPCIT, BG dose ranged from 0.029 to 0.069 mGy/MBq. In half of all subjects, BG dose exceeded 85% of the published critical organ (bladder) dose, and in three of those, the BG dose exceeded that for the bladder. The BG can become the dose-limiting organ in studies using dopamine transporter ligands. For some normal subjects studied with F-18 or long half-life radionuclide, the BG may exceed bladder dose and become the critical structure.

A competitive binding assay using CHO membranes showed that GM (IC50 = 0.034 mu M) more strongly inhibited the binding of the radioligand [H-3] LSD to 5-HT7 receptor than the other alkaloids, suggesting that GM is bound to 5-HT7 receptor. Agonistic/antagonistic effects of GM (1-50 mu M) on the receptor were evaluated by measuring intracellular cAMP levels in HEK239 cells. GM (IC50 = 6.0 mu M) inhibited 5-HT-induced cAMP production in a concentration-dependent manner, as well as the specific 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-269970 (0.1-1 mu M). However, GM did not induce intracellular cAMP production as 5-HT did. These results suggest that GM has an antagonistic effect on 5-HT7 receptor.

Using in vivo molecular imaging and voxel-wise quantification, we aimed to assess the effects of aging on the benzodiazepine (BDZ) recognition site of the GABA A receptor. To visualize BDZ site availability, [C-11]-flumazenil microPET acquisitions were conducted in young and old rats. The data were analyzed and region of interest analyses were applied to validate the voxel-wise approach. We observed decreased [C-11]-flumazenil binding in the aged rat brains in comparison with the young control group. More specifically, clusters of reduced radioligand uptake were detected in the bilateral hippocampus, cerebellum, midbrain, and bilateral frontal and parieto-occipital cortex. Our results support the pertinence of voxel-wise quantification in the analysis of microPET data. Moreover, these findings indicate that the aging process involves declines in neural BDZ recognition site availability, proposed to reflect alterations in GABA A receptor subunit polypeptide expression.

The expression level and biological activity of MCHR2 were evaluated by immunofluorescence and radioligand binding assays. A 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MITT) assay and cell cycle analysis showed that MCH did not affect 3T3-L1-MICHR2 and 3T3-L1-mock cell proliferation. MCH accelerated preadipocyte differentiation of the two cell lines when they were administered various doses of standard adipogenic inducers. The rate and degree of differentiation of the 3T3-L1-MCHR2 cells were higher than those of the 3T3-L1-mock cells. The expression levels of adipocyte-specific marker genes, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 (PPAR gamma 2), CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha), adipocyte-specific fatty acid-binding protein (aP(2)) and leptin were significantly up-regulated, especially in 3T3-L1-MCHR2 cells. These findings suggest that MCHR2 positively mediates the regulation of MCH during preadipocyte differentiation and is involved in energy balance regulation without affecting preadipocyte proliferation.

Several molecular markers have indeed been identified and investigations are ongoing aimed at accomplishing the said goal. These include pancreatic islet antigen (IC-2), somatostatin receptors (SSTRs), and sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) on the pancreatic beta-cells. Therefore investigations exploiting the potential application of the radiolabeled ligands for these receptors for beta-cell imaging are receiving intensive research attention. Radioiodinated peptidomimetic based on beta-naphthylalanine and n-hexanediamine has been synthesized. The molecule was subjected to in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Radioligand binding studies on CHO cell line expressing the SSTR2 showed very low affinity. Nonetheless, biodistribution in normal mice showed significant uptake ill the pancreas. There was partial blockage of the pancreatic uptake when excess of the peptidomimetic was coinjected. The result implies that the pancreatic uptake was receptor mediated but may not involve the SSTR2 and therefore warrants further investigation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The total time required for the synthesis of [C-11]SN003 is 30 min from EOB using [C-11]methyl triflate in the presence of NaOH in acetone. The yield of the synthesis is 22% (EOS) with > 99% chemical and radiochemical purities and a specific activity of > 2000 Ci/mmol. PET studies in baboon show that [C-11]6 penetrates the BBB and accumulates in brain. No detectable specific binding was observed, likely due to the rapid metabolism or low density of CRF1 receptors in primate brain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this report we study a venom component of the Central American scorpion Centruroides limbatus, a short peptide termed hongotoxin, (HgTX(1)), which specifically binds to the voltage-gated potassium channel K(V)1.3 at a molecular stoichiometry of 1:1. A toxin analogue (HgTX(1)-A19C) was subjected to fluorescence labelling studies with Cy5. Utilising an ultrasensitive microscopic method (single-dye tracing; SDT) we were able to directly visualise HgTX(1)-A19C-Cy5 binding to the voltage-gated potassium channel K(V)1.3 on Jurkat cells at the single molecule level. For the first time, this approach allowed the determination of both the dissociation constant (K(D)) and the off-rate (k(off)) of HgTX(1)-A19C-Cy5 on living cells. In order to validate this novel approach, the data obtained with SDT were correlated to radioligand binding studies performed under identical conditions using a radioiodinated HgTX(1) analogue.

To date it has remained unclear whether dopaminergic medication influences the striatal [I-123]FP-CIT binding. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of this medication on [I-123]FP-CIT binding in the brain. We used an animal model in which we administered dopaminomimetics, antipsychotics and an antidepressant. In vivo [I-123]FP-CIT binding to the DA and serotonin transporters was evaluated after subchronic and acute administration of the drugs. The administered medication induced small changes in striatal [I-123]FP-CIT binding which were not statistically significant. As expected, the DA reuptake blocker GBR 12,909 induced a significant decrease in [I-123]FP-CIT binding. [I-123]FP-CIT binding in the serotonin-rich hypothalamus was decreased only after acute administration of fluvoxamine, The results of this study suggest that dopaminergic medication will not affect the results of DA transporter SPET imaging with [I-123]FP-CIT.

Extracts were prepared and tested in three in vitro receptor radioligand binding assays to determine whether there was an indication of biological activity, in particular their selectivity to a single receptor implicated in the mediation of pain. The three neuropeptide receptors chosen were Bradykinin (BK II), expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), neurokinin 1 (NK 1) expressed in astrocytoma cells, and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) which were all implicated in the mediation of acute pain in the mammalian central nervous system. The plant species chosen to investigate were Ageratum conyzoides, Barringtonia edulis, Croton tiglium, Ipomea pes-caprae, Panax ginseng, Physostigma venenosum, Sinomenium acutum, Solidago virgaurea, Symplocos leptophylla and Typhonium giganteum. The results showed that there was a strong indication of biological activity for some of the plants which are used ethnomedicinally to treat pain, in the three in vitro receptor binding assays used, and particular plant extracts exhibited selective action to a single receptor.

Prostate cancer (PCa) remains one of the commonest solid-organ tumors and is associated with significant societal burdens. Despite significant disease heterogeneity, PCa remains an ideal candidate for radiopharmaceutical therapy because of the prolonged disease course, metastatic disease tropism, and sensitivity to radiation therapy. To date, advanced PCa remains one of the most successful arenas for the development and approval of radiopharmaceutical agents. In this review, we aim to summarize the complex processes required to obtain regulatory approval for a novel agent and highlight the limitations and hurdles specific to the approval of radiopharmaceutical agents. In advanced PCa, we outline the importance of a framework for trial design with respect to defining dis-ease state and acceptable outcome measures-as recommended by the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group (PCWG). Finally, using the principles mandated by the Food and Drug Administration approval process and the framework provided by the PCWG, we out-line experience with the successful approval of the radiopharmaceuti-cal agents 223Ra and 177Lu-PSMA-617.

An mGluR2 function in etiology could be unveiled by positron emission tomography (PET). In this regard, 5-(2-fluoro-4-[C-11]methoxyphenyl)-2,2-dimethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrano [2,3-b]-pyridine-7-carboxamide ([C-11])13, [C-11]mG2N001), a potent negative allosteric modulator (NAM), was developed to support this endeavor. [C-11]13 was synthesized via the O-[C-11]methylation of phenol 24 with a high molar activity of 212 +/- 76 GBq/mu mol (n = 5) and excellent radiochemical purity (>99%). PET imaging of [C-11]13 in rats demonstrated its superior brain heterogeneity and reduced accumulation with pretreatment of mGluR2 NAMs, VU6001966 (9) and MNI-137 (26), the extent of which revealed a time-dependent drug effect of the blocking agents. In a nonhuman primate, [ C-11]13 selectively accumulated in mGluR2-rich regions and resulted in high-contrast brain images. Therefore, [C-11]13 is a potential candidate for translational PET imaging of the mGluR2 function.

Evaluating Marine Cyanobacteria as a Source for CNS Receptor Ligands	MOLECULES			English	Article						marine cyanobacteria; G-protein coupled receptor; central nervous system; natural products	CHRONIC PAIN; FATTY-ACID; SEROTONIN	Natural products have a long history as a source of psychoactive agents and pharmacological tools for understanding the brain and its circuitry. In the last two decades, marine cyanobacteria have become a standard source of natural product ligands with cytotoxic properties. The study of cyanobacterial metabolites as CNS modulatory agents has remained largely untapped, despite the need for new molecules to treat and understand CNS disorders. We have generated a library of 301 fractions from 37 field collected cyanobacterial samples and screened these fractions against a panel of CNS receptors using radiolabeled ligand competitive-binding assays. Herein we present an analysis of the screening data collected to date, which show that cyanobacteria are prolific producers of compounds which bind to important CNS receptors, including those for 5-HT, DA, monoamine transporters, adrenergic, sigma, and cannabinoid receptors. In addition to the analysis of our screening efforts, we will also present the isolation of five compounds from the same cyanobacterial collection to illustrate how pre-fractionation followed by radioligand screening can lead to rapid identification of selective CNS agents. The systematic screening of natural products sources, specifically filamentous marine cyanobacteria, will yield a number of lead compounds for further development as pharmacological tools and therapeutics.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]GE-180 PET Detects Reduced Microglia Activation After LM11A-31 Therapy in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease	THERANOSTICS			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; [F-18]GE-180; flutriciclamide; neuroinflammation; PET; TSPO; LM11A-31	PROTEIN 18 KDA; IN-VIVO; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; TRANSGENIC MODEL; AMYLOID-BETA; NEUROINFLAMMATION; TSPO; RECEPTOR; DEGENERATION	Microglial activation is a key pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PET imaging of translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is a strategy to detect microglial activation in vivo. Here we assessed flutriciclamide ([F-18]GE-180), a new second-generation TSPO-PET radiotracer, for its ability to monitor response to LM11A-31, a novel AD therapeutic in clinical trials. AD mice displaying pathology were treated orally with LM11A-31 for 3 months. Subsequent [F-18]GE-180-PET imaging revealed significantly lower signal in cortex and hippocampus of LM11A-31-treated AD mice compared to those treated with vehicle, corresponding with decreased levels of TSPO immunostaining and microglial Iba1 immunostaining. In addition to detecting decreased microglial activation following LM11A-31 treatment, [F-18]GE-180 identified activated microglia in AD mice with greater sensitivity than another second-generation TSPO radiotracer, [F-18]PBR06. Together, these data demonstrate the promise of [F-18]GE-180 as a potentially sensitive tool for tracking neuroinflammation in AD mice and for monitoring therapeutic modulation of microglial activation.

Anticholinergic Accumulation: A Slumbering Interaction between Drugs and Food Supplements	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; DELIRIUM; POPULATION; DEMENTIA; IMPACT; MEDICATIONS; BURDEN; RISK; ASSOCIATION	Many compounds display anticholinergic effects which might give rise to cognitive impairment and even delirium. These side effects are caused by their ability to bind to muscarinic receptors in our brain. Especially with combination of compounds, these serious effects are seen. This phenomenon, known as anticholinergic accumulation, is especially seen in the elderly. A classification of drugs for anticholinergic side effects has been made based on clinical observations, the ACB score. Here, we aimed to substantiate this classification by comparing the affinity of numerous drugs for the muscarinic receptors to the ACB score. Additionally, a number of supplements were screened. The affinity of the compounds was determined by their ability to displace the radioligand [H-3]pirenzepine of the muscarinic receptor induced by these compounds. Our results show that the affinity of a compound for the muscarinic receptors correlated with its ACB score. Also food supplements appeared to bind to these muscarinic receptors. Moreover, several drug-drug, supplement-supplement and supplement-drug combinations had an affinity that is higher than the affinity of single compounds. This explains the phenomenon of anticholinergic accumulation. In conclusion, care should be taken to drug-drug and supplement-drug combinations with respect to anticholinergic accumulation.

The chemical structure of new compounds was confirmed by FT-IR, H-1 NMR,C-13 NMR and HRMS spectra as well as elemental analysis. Affinity of the novel pyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine derivatives for 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A receptors and serotonin transporter (SERT) was evaluated in an in vitro radioligand binding assay. Tested compounds showed moderate to high affinity for 5-HT1AR and SERT and low affinity for 5-HT2AR. Selected ligands were subjected to in vivo tests, such as induced hypothermia and the forced swimming test in mice, which determined presynaptic agonistic activity of the ligands 8d, 8e, 9d and 9e and presynaptic antagonistic activity of the ligands 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b. Additionally, metabolic stability evaluation was performed for selected ligands, proving that a para-substitution in the 4-aryl-pyrido[1,2-c]pyrimidine moiety leads to an increase in stability, whereas a substitution in the ortho-position lowers the stability.

Each of these perspectives contributes new insights into drug action, particularly for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The aim of this study was to develop a fluorescein derivative, FLUO-QUINa novel antagonist of the cholecystokinin-B/gastrin receptor. A radioligand-binding experiment revealed an IC50 of 4.79 nm, and the antagonist inhibited gastric acid secretion in an isolated lumen-perfused mouse stomach assay (up to 51?% at 100 nm). The fluorescence properties altered upon binding to the receptor, and the fluorophore was quenched to a greater extent when free than in the bound form. FLUO-QUIN specifically bound to human pancreatic carcinoma cells, MiaPaca-2, which are known to express the receptor, as evidenced by rapid clustering followed by time-dependent receptor internalization. This proves the stability of FLUO-QUIN and its ability to penetrate vesicular membranes and reach various cell targets. Hence it might be used as an agent for the detection of CCK-B-receptor-positive tumors by fluorescence imaging.

With neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y-1, Y-2, and Y-5 receptors as model systems, a homogenous flow cytometric method for the simultaneous determination of the affinity, selectivity, and activity of GPCR ligands was developed. Mixtures of cells expressing the receptors of interest and cyonine-labeled NPY as a universal fluorescent Y-1, Y-2, and Y-5 receptor agonist were used. Calcium mobilization was measured in different channels with the aid of fluo-4 and fura red A combination of dye-loaded HEL-Y, and CHO-Y-2-G alpha(qi5) cells with unloaded HEC-1B-Y-5 cells allowed the simultaneous determination of Y-1, Y-2, and Y-5 receptor selectivity preceded by the Y-1 and Y-2 receptor-mediated response with one and the some sample. The data are in good agreement with those determined by radioligand binding and spectro fluorimetry. The convenient, robust, and inexpensive multiparametric procedure offers a broad range of applications in the pharmacological characterization of GPCR ligands.

J	Houghten, RA; Dooley, CT; Appel, JR				Houghten, RA; Dooley, CT; Appel, JR			De novo identification of highly active fluorescent kappa opioid ligands from a rhodamine labeled tetrapeptide positional scanning library	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article							COMBINATORIAL LIBRARIES; ENKEPHALIN DERIVATIVES; OPIATE RECEPTORS; AMINO-ACIDS; PROBES; AFFINITY; MU; SPECIFICITY; PEPTIDES; DELTA	Highly active fluorescent compounds having kappa opioid activity were identified following the screening in a kappa-specific radioligand binding assay of a positional scanning tetrapeptide combinatorial library in which every tetrapeptide was fluorescently labeled. Lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl chloride was coupled to the N terminal of a mixture-based tetrapeptide positional scanning library made up of over 7.3 million tetrapeptides. Upon determination of the most active mixtures for each position of the library in the kappa binding assay, individual rhodamine labeled tetrapeptides were then synthesized and tested to determine their activities. Eight individual rhodamine labeled peptides were identified that were specific for the kappa opioid receptor, having binding affinities ranging from 5-20 nM. These peptides were poor inhibitors at the mu and delta receptors (K-i > 5,000 nM). Furthermore, neither rhodamine itself nor these same tetrapeptides lacking the N-terminal rhodamine had any significant activity at the kappa receptor, indicating that both the tetrapeptide sequence and the rhodamine moiety are required for receptor binding. This study has demonstrated that novel fluorescent compounds with intrinsic activity can be identified through the use of combinatorial chemistry. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Renal alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors are implicated in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. In the present study, the levels of renal alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors, and spleen alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors, were quantified in tissue membranes from rats treated with the AAS nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg) for 14 days. The radioligands used were [H-3]-prazosin and [H-3]-RX821002. The nandrolone treatment caused a 50% reduction of kidney alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors (from 15 fmol/mg protein in control rats to 6.5 fmol/mg protein in treated rats). In contrast, the levels of kidney alpha(1A)-, alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-, and spleen alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors were unaffected. These results raise the possibility that a decreased level of kidney alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors may cause some of the effects observed on blood pressure and fluid balance in heavy abuse of AAS.

A series of analogs has been prepared for this purpose: chemically modified derivatives, including a covalently linked dimer of GI, as well as analogs wherein one or several amino acid residues have been changed using solid-phase peptide synthesis. The activity of all compounds was assessed in competition with radioiodinated and/or tritiated alpha-conotoxin GI for binding to the membrane-bound AChR of Torpedo californica. Binding of radioiodinated alpha-conotoxin GI dimer was also monitored directly, revealing the largest, as compared to all other analogues, difference in the affinity between the two binding sites in the receptor (K-D similar to11 and 1200 nM). Comparison of binding data with the results of CD measurements point to important role of the spatial organization of the alpha-conotoxin second loop in manifestation of their "muscle" or "neuronal" specificity.

The affinity of the compounds for chicken brain melatonin receptors and recombinant human MT1 and MT2 receptors was evaluated using 2-[I-125]-iodomelatonin as the radioligand. Overall, the introduction of an oxygen atom in the amido chain was not a favourable parameter as the compounds were less potent than the corresponding deoxy derivatives. However, nanomolar compounds were obtained with the arylethyloxy derivatives (13c (R' = nPr), chicken brain, hMT(1), hMT(2), K-i values: 4.8, 3.86, 2.4 nM, respectively) and the 2,7-dimethoxynaphthalene derivatives (17c (R' = nPr), chicken brain, hMT(1), hMT(2), K-i values: 0.04, 0.13, 0.1 nM, respectively). The functional activity of these compounds was evaluated by the aggregation of melanophores in Xenopus laevis tadpoles and the potency was related to the affinity of the molecules for melatonin receptors. The compounds were found to be full agonists and compound 17a was 20-fold more potent than melatonin in this bioassay. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We have previously reported decreased neurotensin receptor density in layer II of the intermediate entorhinal cortex (ERC) in schizophrenia, a finding seen elsewhere but not seen in more caudal ERC. Methods: To study neuroanatomic and diagnostic specificity, we measured the density of neurotensin receptors in the intermediate and caudal ERC and hippocampal formation of schizophrenic, affective disorder control subjects, and normal control subjects. Slide-based radioligand binding was used to perform these studies. Results: Not only schizophrenic but also affective disorder subjects had decreased neurotensin receptor density in layer II of the intermediate ERC Affective disorder subjects had significantly decreased neurotensin receptor density in layers V/VI of the intermediate ERC, and schizophrenic subjects trended in the same direction. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate region-specific changes in neurotensin receptor binding levels in the mesial temporal lobe; however, there is no clear diagnostic specificity for these changes, because they were seen to varying degrees in both schizophrenia and affective disorders.

We have investigated the binding characteristics of NAADP(+) to its receptor in sea urchin egg homogenates. NAADP(+) binds to a saturable membrane-bound site with high affinity (K-d = 193 +/- 35.7 pM). NAADP(+) associates to its receptor with a t(1/2) of approximately 7 min while dissociation does not occur during the time course of the experiment. Furthermore, NAD(+), NAAD(+), ADP, or ATP cannot displace NAADP(+) binding. The structurally related molecules NADP(+) and NADPH displayed a markedly lower affinity for the binding site with K-d's 500- and 25,000-fold higher than NAADP(+), respectively. This discrepancy between oxidized and reduced forms of NADP(+) might suggest that NAADP(+) signaling is itself regulated by the redox state of the cell. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

The prototype, named improgan, shows a preclinical profile of a highly effective analgesic, with activity against thermal, mechanical and inflammatory nociception after doses that do not alter motor balance or locomotor activity. Improgan analgesia is not blocked by opioid antagonists and is observed in opioid receptor knock-out mice. Unlike morphine, improgan does not induce tolerance after daily dosing. Extensive in vitro pharmacology studies have excluded known histaminergic, opioid, serotonergic, GABAergic and adrenergic receptor mechanisms, as well as 50 other sites of action. The improgan-like analgesic activity of some HA congeners suggests an analgesic action on a novel HA receptor, but further studies are required to substantiate this. Studies in progress are characterizing the sites and mechanisms of action of improgan, and developing brain-penetrating derivatives that could be useful for clinical pain.

Methods: Safety and survival of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and liver metastases assigned to Lu-177-PSMA alone (n = 31) or in combination with SIRT (n = 5) were retrospectively analyzed. Additionally, a subgroup (n = 10) was analyzed using morphologic and molecular response criteria. Results: Median estimated survival was 5.7 mo for Lu-177-PSMA alone and 8.4 mo for combined sequential Lu-177-PSMA and SIRT. Lu-177-PSMA achieved discordant therapy responses with both regressive and progressive liver metastases in the same patient (best vs. worst responding metastases per patient: -35% vs. +63% diameter change; P < 0.05). SIRT was superior to Lu-177-PSMA for the treatment of liver metastases (0% vs. 56% progression). Conclusion: The combination of Lu-177-PSMA and SIRT is efficient and feasible for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer. Lu-177-PSMA alone seems to have limited response rates in the treatment of liver metastases.

Accumulating evidence indicates that it plays a crucial role in psychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety. Positron emission tomography (PET) combined with a TRPC5 specific radioligand may provide a unique tool to investigate the functions of TRPC5 in animal disease models to guide drug development targeting TRPC5. To develop a TRPC5 PET radiotracer, the potent TRPC5 inhibitor HC608 was chosen for C-11 radiosynthesis through the N-demethyl amide precursor 7 reacting with [C-11]methyl iodide. Under optimized conditions, [C-11]HC608 was achieved with good radiochemical yield (25 +/- 5%), high chemical and radiochemical purity (>99%), and high specific activity (204-377 GBq mu mol(-1), decay corrected to the end of bombardment, EOB). The in vitro autoradiography study revealed that [C-11]HC608 specifically binds to TRPC5. Moreover, initial in vivo evaluation of [C-11]HC608 performed in rodents and the microPET study in the brain of non-human primates further demonstrated that [C-11]HC608 was able to penetrate the blood brain barrier and sufficiently accumulate in the brain. These results suggest that [C-11]HC608 has the potential to be a PET tracer for imaging TRPC5 in vivo.

Using an infusion protocol in rats, we visualized the acute effect of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on mGluR5 in rat brain. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist known to increase glutamate release. Imaging was performed with a high-affinity PET ligand [C-11]ABP688, a negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5. Binding did not change significantly from baseline to ketamine in any region, thereby confirming previous literature with other NMDA receptor antagonists in rodents. Hence, in rats, we could not reproduce the findings in a human setup showing significant decreases in the [C-11]ABP688 binding after a ketamine bolus followed by ketamine infusion. Species differences may have contributed to the different findings in the present study of rats. In conclusion, we could not confirm in rats that endogenous glutamate increases by ketamine infusion are reflected in [C-11]ABP688 binding decreases as was previously shown for humans.

Quantitative and specific imaging of demyelination would thus provide critical clinical insight. Here, we investigated the possibility of targeting axonal potassium channels to image demyelination by positron emission tomography (PET). These channels, which normally reside beneath the myelin sheath, become exposed upon demyelination and are the target of the MS drug, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). We demonstrate using autoradiography that 4-AP has higher binding in non-myelinated and demyelinated versus well-myelinated CNS regions, and describe a fluorine-containing derivative, 3-F-4-AP, that has similar pharmacological properties and can be labeled with F-18 for PET imaging. Additionally, we demonstrate that [F-18]3-F-4-AP can be used to detect demyelination in rodents by PET. Further evaluation in Rhesus macaques shows higher binding in non-myelinated versus myelinated areas and excellent properties for brain imaging. Together, these data indicate that [F-18]3-F-4-AP may be a valuable PET tracer for detecting CNS demyelination noninvasively.

The relatively poor relationship between TSPO ligand binding affinities and steroidogenic efficacies prompted us to investigate the time (Residence Time, RT) that a number of compounds with phenylindolylglyoxylamide structure (PIGAs) spends in contact with the target. Here, given the poor availability of TSPO ligand kinetic parameters, a kinetic radioligand binding assay was set up and validated for RT determination using a theoretical mathematical model successfully applied to other ligand-target systems. TSPO ligand RT was quantified and the obtained results showed a positive correlation between the period for which a drug interacts with TSPO and the compound ability to stimulate steroidogenesis. Specifically, the TSPO ligand RT significantly fitted both with steroidogenic efficacy (E-max) and with area under the dose-response curve, a parameter combining drug potency and efficacy. A positive relation between RT and anxiolytic activity of three compounds was evidenced. In conclusion, RT could be a relevant parameter to predict the steroidogenic efficacy and the in vivo anxiolytic action of new TSPO ligands.

The current study demonstrates that pathological cortical cholinergic deafferentation can be quantified in vivo with [F-18]FEOBV PET, yielding analogous results to postmortem histological techniques. Methods: Fifteen male rats (3 months old) underwent a cerebral infusion of 192 IgG-saporin at the level of the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. They were scanned using [F-18]FEOBV PET, then sacrificed, and their brain tissues collected for immunostaining and quantification of cholinergic denervation using optical density (OD). Results: For both PET binding and postmortem OD, the highest losses were found in the cortical areas, with the highest reductions in the orbitofrontal, sensorimotor, and cingulate cortices. In addition, OD quantification in the affected areas accurately predicts [F-18]FEOBV uptake in the same regions when regressed linearly. Conclusions: These findings support [F-18]FEOBV as a reliable imaging agent for eventual use in human neurodegenerative conditions in which cholinergic losses are an important aspect.

[F-18]4 was synthesized by [F-18]fluorination of a novel nitro precursor 3 with [F-18]KF in the presence of Kryptofix 222. At the end of synthesis, 429-936 MBq (n = 8) of [F-18]4 was obtained with > 99% radiochemical purity and 204-559 GBq/mu mol specific activity starting from 6.7 to 13.0 GBq of [F-18]F. The brain distribution of [F-18]4 was determined by the in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography using rat brain sections. The in vitro and in vivo specific binding of [F-18]4 to mGluR1 was detected in the cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus, and striatum. These results suggest that [F-18]4 is a promising PET ligand for the in vivo evaluation of mGluR1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These tissue sections contain a radiolabelled ligand bound to a specific biomolecule under study. This radioligand emits beta- or beta+ particles ionizing silver halide crystals in the film. High spatial resolution autoradiograms are obtained using low energy radioisotopes, such as H-3 where an intrinsic 0.1-1 mu m spatial resolution can be achieved. Several digital alternatives have been presented over the past few years to replace conventional film but their spatial resolution has yet to equal film, although silicon-based imaging technologies have demonstrated higher sensitivity compared to conventional film. It will be shown in this work how pixel size is a critical parameter for achieving high spatial resolution for low energy uncollimated beta imaging. In this work we also examine the confounding factors impeding silicon-based technologies with respect to spatial resolution. The study considers charge diffusion in silicon and detector noise, and this is applied to a range of radioisotopes typically used in autoradiography. Finally an optimal detector geometry to obtain the best possible spatial resolution for a specific technology and a specific radioisotope is suggested.

We have previously shown that the decrease in pLMV is associated with specific and transient withdrawal signs. In the present study, the selective benzodiazepine-receptor antagonist flumazenil significantly antagonized (P<0.05), by co-application, the ability of each agonist to produce the withdrawal. These results: (1) suggest that benzodiazepine-receptor agonists, for two different chemical categories, produce dose-related physical dependence manifested as abstinenceinduced withdrawal in this simple and convenient model, and (2) in the absence of cloning or radioligand binding literature, suggest a possible specific interaction site (receptor?) for these compounds in planarians.

Based on the results of a radioligand receptors assay that human mesenchymal stein cells (hMSCs) express a high level of transferrin receptors, iodinated transferrin (I-131-Tf(Fe)(2)) was chosen as the radiotracer for imaging the cells implanted into the spinal cords of rabbits. Accumulation of radioactivity at the cell transplanted sites was assessed 16 and 24 hours post-intrathecal injection of I-131-Tf(Fe)(2). Transferrin receptors expression and Tf binding of the implanted cells were verified by immunofluorescence, and ex vivo phosphor imaging. The specificity of Tf uptake of hMSCs was proved through control experiments, i.e., replacing I-131-Tf(Fe), with I-131 labeled human serum albumin as the tracer or substituting hMSCs with phosphate buffered saline as the grafts. Despite some defects, such as the invasive administration of the tracer and the non-specificity of transferrin receptors as a marker of stem cells in this preliminary study, the technique of nuclear medicine imaging is considered to have great potential in tracking implanted cells in vivo.

All target compounds showed good affinities for the al-adrenoceptor, with K-i values in the low nanomolar range. The polymethylene chain constituting the spacer between the furoylpiperazinyl pyridazinone and the arylpiperazine moiety was shown to influence the affinity and selectivity of these compounds. Particularly, a gradual increase in affinity was observed by lengthening the polymethylene chain up to a maximum of seven carbon atoms. In addition, compound 3k, characterized by a very interesting alpha (1)-AR affinity (1.9 nM), was also shown to be a highly selective alpha (1)-AR antagonist, the affinity ratio for alpha (2)- and alpha (1)-adrenoceptors being 274. To gain insight into the structural features required for al antagonist activity, the pyridazinone derivatives were submitted to a pharmacophore generation procedure using the program Catalyst. The resulting pharmacophore model showed high correlation and predictive power. It also rationalized the relationships between structural properties and biological data of, and external to, the pyridazinone class.

In transfected HEK cells expressing the D-2L receptor under an inducible promoter, LASSBio-579 and LQFM 037, but not clozapine, behaved as weak partial agonists in [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding assays performed in optimized conditions previously shown to evidence the partial agonist profile of aripiprazole. Besides, data obtained in radioligand competition assays on rat striatal membranes suggested a rapid association to and dissociation from the D-2-like receptors. Using the kinetic rate index based on the strategy of the dual-point competition association assay, we showed that our compounds share a similar kinetic profile with clozapine, distinct from the typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These two characteristics could contribute to the atypical-like profile observed after administration of LASSBio-579 to rodents, in models of positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

Many monoamine receptor subtypes (e.g., dopamine D1 and D2) demonstrate altered expression levels in depressed patients and animal models of depression. Currently, there are an increasing number of molecular and biochemical studies on the mechanism of stress resilience. In this chapter, we describe a chronic mild stress (CMS) procedure along with in situ hybridization and autoradiography protocols to study changes in brain dopamine receptor expression of rats subjected to CMS. Chronic mild stress procedure (CMS) is one of few behavioral animal models of depression, and this model has good construct, face, and predictive validity. Moreover, approximately 30 % of rats exposed to stress regimen are stress resilient. There are numerous biochemical techniques that allow to measure changes in receptor density and the mRNA expression level. Receptor-specific radioligand binding measures concentration and visualizes the spatial distribution of the receptor proteins. In situ hybridization is a specific probe-based semiquantitative histochemical technique that can be used to visualize the spatial distribution of RNA sequences in tissue slices.

The novel heterobivalent hybrids 4a-f along with the intermediate alcohols 5a-f were pharmacologically evaluated in radioligand binding assays and some of them for their functional efficacies in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based assays to give an insight into the structure-activity relationships of bivalent and linker-attached compounds in mAChRs. The hybrid 4d exhibited high efficacy for beta-arrestin2 engagement in M-1 mAChR and alcohol 5c behaved much like 3 at M-1 mAChR and showed full antagonism in both Gi activation and beta-arrestin2 engagement at M-4 mAChR. Moreover, docking simulations on the M-1 mAChR model were performed to elucidate how the binding mode of the proposed compounds is influenced by the linker length.

The aim of this article is to provide an update on recent major developments in neurochemical imaging in schizophrenia research. In this concise review, we discuss the major findings on three neurotransmitters, namely dopamine, serotonin and glutamate. The most promising radioligand for D-2/D-3 neuroreceptor imaging is the agonist [C-11] PHNO, with higher in vivo affinity for D-3 than D-2 receptors, which can be used to measure amphetamine-induced release of dopamine, and therefore a potential model of dopaminergic alterations in schizophrenia. Recent development of selective radiotracers allow imaging of the serotonin transporter (SERT) using positron emission tomography (PET) with selective tracers such as [C-11] DASB. Additionally, the glutamatergic hypothesis has evolved from theory to phase III clinical trials of newer agents with novel mechanisms. With the development of newer radioligands and the in vivo application of magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) at relatively high magnetic field strengths, there is ample scope for further neuroimaging advances.

Activated microglia is characterized by increased expression of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) in the brain and may be a useful biomarker of inflammation. In this study, we evaluated neuroinflammation in ALS patients using a radioligand of TSPO, F-18-DPA-714. Ten patients with probable or definite ALS (all right-handed, without dementia, and untreated by riluzole or other medication that might bias the binding on the TSPO), were enrolled prospectively and eight healthy controls matched for age underwent a PET study. Comparison of the distribution volume ratios between both groups were performed using a Mann-Whitney's test. Significant increase of distribution of volume ratios values corresponding to microglial activation was found in the ALS sample in primary motor, supplementary motor and temporal cortex (p = 0.009, p = 0.001 and p = 0.004, respectively). These results suggested that the cortical uptake of F-18-DPA-714 was increased in ALS patients during the "time of diagnosis" phase of the disease. This finding might improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of ALS and might be a surrogate marker of efficacy of treatment on microglial activation.

In this study, a novel series of indanone derivatives were synthesized and characterized. In in vitro binding studies, compound 2?e exhibited a Ki value of 16 nM with a human AD brain homogenate. Although they displayed relatively low affinities for 2?i and 2?jwith Ki values of 99 and 237 nM, respectivelythe SPs in AD brain sections were positively stained by 2?j. A method for in situ micro-autoradiography of AD brain was developed in this study and showed clear labeling of SPs by [125I]2?i and [125I]2?j. Both [125I]2?i and [125I]2?j had suitable lipophilicities and displayed high initial uptake and rapid clearance from the mouse brains. Furthermore, [125I]2?i and [125I]2?j were more stable in human brain homogenates than in mouse brain homogenates. These data suggest that such indanone derivatives might represent potential amyloid imaging agents for the detection of SPs in AD.

LCM has a different mode of action from traditional sodium channel blocking AEDs in that it selectively enhances slow inactivation of sodium channels without affecting fast inactivation. Initial investigations suggested that LCM might have an additional mode of action by binding to the collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP-2), which is further investigated here. Methods: LCM binding to native and cloned human CRMP-2 was determined using radioligand binding experiments and surface plasmon resonance measurements. Results: No specific binding of [3H]LCM (free concentration 1001450 nM) to isolated or membrane bound human CRMP-2 expressed in mammalian cell systems and bacteria was observed. Surface plasmon resonance analysis also showed that LCM, over a concentration range of 0.39100 mu M, does not specifically bind to human CRMP-2. Conclusion: The diverse drug binding methods employed here are well suited to detect specific binding of LCM to CRMP-2 in the micromolar range, yet the results obtained were all negative. Results of this study suggest that LCM does not specifically bind to CRMP-2.

In the present study, we report on the development two potential PET probes, [F-18]FPYBF-2 ([F-18]10) and [F-18]FPHBF-2 ([F-18]21), for imaging of beta-amyloid plagues in AD brain. In experiments in vitro, 10 and 21 displayed high affinity for A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i = 2.41 and 3.85 nM, respectively). In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, they displayed high uptake in the brain (7.38 and 8.18% ID/g at 2 mm postinjection,, respectively), and the radioactivity washed out from the, brain rapidly (3.15 and 3.87% ID/g at 60 min postinjection, respectively), which is highly desirable for beta-amyloid imaging agents. In vivo, they clearly labeled beta-amyloid plaques in Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, the specific labeling of beta-amyloid plaques by 10 and 21 was observed in autoradiographs of sections of autopsied AD brain. These new fluorinated benzofuran derivatives are promising PET probes for imaging cerebral beta-amyloid plaques.

In the present PET study, we examined effects of PKA modulators in conscious rats on the binding of [C-11](R)-rolipram in comparison to the much less active enantiomer [C-11](S)-rolipram. Unilateral injection of a PKA activator (dibutyryl-cAMP) and a PKA inhibitor (Rp-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate) into the striatum significantly increased and decreased, respectively, the binding of [C-11](R)-rolipram. These effects were not caused by changes in blood flow or delivery of radioligand to brain, since these agents had no effect on the binding of [C-11](S)-rolipram binding. These results support the value of measuring in vivo [C-11](R)-rolipram binding in brain to assess responses to physiological or pharmacological challenges to the cAMP second messenger system.

Recently, we reported the use of peptide-conjugated QDs for non-invasive NIRF imaging of tumor vasculature markers in small animal models. In this protocol, we describe the detailed procedure for the preparation of such peptide-conjugated QDs using commercially available PEG-coated QDs and arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) peptides. Conjugation of the thiolated RGD peptide to the QDs was achieved through a heterobifunctional linker, 4-maleimidobutyric acid N-succinimidyl ester. Competitive cell binding assay, using I-125-echistatin as the radioligand, and live cell staining were carried out to confirm the successful attachment of the RGD peptides to the QD surface before in vivo imaging of tumor- bearing mice. In general, QD conjugation and in vitro validation of the peptide-conjugated QDs can be accomplished within 1-2 d; in vivo imaging will take another 1-2 d depending on the experimental design.

The central serotonergic system is located in the raphe nuclei and the adjacent reticular formation in the brainstem. Recently, radioligands targeting the brain serotonin transport protein (SERT) have been developed. We used the highly specific SERT-radioligand I-123 [2-((2-((dimethylamino) methyl)phenyl)thio)-5-iodophenylamine] to test the hypothesis of the mesopontine serotonergic system being involved in the pathophysiology of migraine. Nineteen migraine patients and 10 healthy, age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled. The neuroimaging study was performed interictally during the pain-free interval. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT)-images were coregistered with MRI-scans. Region of interest (ROI)-analysis revealed a highly significant increase of I-123-ADAM uptake in the mesopontine brainstem of migraineurs (p < 0.001). In contrast, (123)IADAM uptake in the thalamus did not differ significantly between migraineurs and controls. Our study demonstrates for the first time a significant increase of brainstem SERT-availability in migraineurs, suggesting a dysregulation of the brainstem serotonergic system. It remains to be elucidated whether the altered SERT-availability is causally related to migraine pathophysiology or whether it reflects secondary pathophysiological mechanisms.

Both methods employ the same rabbit antiserum to a 7-O-carboxymethyl-5-hydroxy-4'-methoxyisoflavone-bovine serum albumin (BSA) conjugate. A I-125-labeled hapten-tyrosine methyl ester (TME) conjugate was used as a radioligand for the RIA. The indirect ELISA uses immunogen-coated microtitration plates and a peroxidase-labeled antirabbit Ig antibody. Both methods are specific for biochanin A with a comparable sensitivity (3.1 pg/tube for RIA; 5.3 pg/well for ELISA); however, their sensitivity to individual cross-reactants differs. The main cross-reactants are sissotrin (the cross-reactivity 15.7% for RIA; 120% for ELISA), 5-hydroxy, 4',7-dimethoxy isoflavone (51.5% for RIA; 46.5% for ELISA), prunetin (4.5% for RIA; 5.0% for ELISA), genistein (0.8% for RIA; 2.8% for ELISA) and formononetin (0.4% for RIA; 0.3% for ELISA). These methods were used for the analysis of biochanin A in alfalfa and in several nonleguminous plants. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We hypothesized that a genetically determined low number of adenosine A(2A) receptors could be a vulnerability factor for the development of the disease. The density of adenosine A(2A) receptors was investigated in human postmortem striatum of patients with schizophrenia (n = 9) and matched controls In = 9) using [H-3)CGS 21680 as a radioligand probe. The maximum number of binding sites (B-max) was 70% higher in patients with schizophrenia than in matched controls (609.4 +/- 259.1 vs 354.0 +/- 156.4 fmol/mg protein, p=0.04). No significant difference could be discerned for the affinity of caffeine for adenosine A(2A) receptors between patients and controls. The increase in receptor density correlated with the dose of antipsychotic medication in chlorpromazine equivalents (r(2) =0.61, p = 0.014). We failed to provide evidence for a genetically determined reduction of adenosine A(2A) receptors in schizophrenia. Instead, consistent with findings from animal experiments, our observation supports a role of adenosine A(2A) receptors in the molecular effects of antipsychotic drugs.

We used late gestation fetal and neonatal lambs to study developmental regulation of EP receptors. In the fetal DA, radioligand binding and RT-PCR assays virtually failed to detect EP1 but detected EP2, EP3D, and EP4 receptors in equivalent proportions. In the newborn lamb, DA total density was one-third of that found in the fetus and only EP2 was detected. Stimulation of EP2 and EP4 increased cAMP formation and was associated with DA relaxation. Though stimulation of EP3 inhibited cAMP formation, it surprisingly relaxed the fetal DA both in vitro and in vivo. This EP3-induced relaxation was specifically diminished by the ATP-sensitive K+ (K-ATP) channel blocker glibenclamide. In conclusion, PGE(2) dilates the late gestation fetal DA through pathways that involve either cAMP (EP2 and EP4) or K-ATP channels (EP3). The loss of EP3 and EP4 receptors in the newborn DA is consistent with its decreased responsiveness to PGE(2).

We previouslyreported the effectiveness of PSMA-DA1 as a PSMA-targeting radiotheranosticagent containing an albumin binder moiety. To further enhance tumoruptake, we newly designed PSMA-NAT-DA1 (PNT-DA1) by the introductionof a lipophilic linker into PSMA-DA1. The PSMA affinity of [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 was increased (K (d) = 8.20nM) compared with that of [In-111]In-PSMA-DA1 (K (d) = 89.4 nM). [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 showed markedlyhigh tumor accumulation (131.6% injected dose/g at 48 h post-injection),and [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 enabled the visualization of thetumor clearly at 24 h post-injection with SPECT/CT imaging. The administrationof [Ac-225]Ac-PNT-DA1 (2.5 kBq) led to shrinkage of thetumor without marked toxicity, and the antitumor effects of [Ac-225]Ac-PNT-DA1 were superior to those of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-DA1and [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617, which is the current gold standardfor PSMA-targeting Ac-225-endoradiotherapy. These resultssuggest that the combination of [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 and [Ac-225]Ac-PNT-DA1 comprises a promising method of PSMA-targetingradiotheranostics.

Discovery of 3-(2-aminoethyl)-thiazolidine-2,4-diones as a novel chemotype of sigma-1 receptor ligands	CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN			English	Article						docking; neuropathic pain; scaffold hopping; sigma receptor; thiazolidinedione	MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY; BINDING; ANTAGONIST; MODEL	Sigma receptor is a transmembrane non-GPCR protein expressed mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane associated with mitochondria. It is classified into two types: Sigma-1 (S1R) and Sigma-2 (S2R) based on their biological functions. S1R has been implicated in many neurological disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia, and depression. Therefore, S1R ligands possess a variety of potential clinical applications with a great interest in the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel lead compound for S1R binding, based on the thiazolidine-2,4-dione nucleus. We have explored hydrophobic groups of different sizes on both sides of the five-membered ring scaffold guided by the crystal structure of S1R. Six compounds showed more than 50% displacement of the radioligand at 10 mu M concentration with compound 6c resulting in 100% displacement and a K-i of 95.5 nM. Moreover, compounds 6c and 6e showed a significant selectivity over S2R. In addition, molecular docking predicted that all the compounds showed the critical salt bridge with Glu172 with variable degrees of pi-stacking interaction with Tyr103. Upon optimization, this series of compounds could represent potential clinically useful S1R ligands for pain management.

[F-18]5a was prepared using a one-pot, two-step labeling procedure in an automated synthesis module, with a radiochemical purity of >95%, and a specific activity of 25-45 GBq/mu mol. Cellular association, biodistribution, and autoradiography with blocking experiments indicated specific binding of [F-18]5a to sigma(1) receptors in vitro and in vivo. Small annual positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using mouse tumor xenograft models demonstrated a high accumulation in human carcinoma and melanoma. Treatment with haloperidol significantly reduced the accumulation of the radiotracer in tumors. These findings suggest that radiotracer with suitable lipophilicity and appropriate affinity for sigma(1) receptors could be used for tumor imaging.

Furthermore, the properties of pharmaceuticals can be enhanced significantly by the introduction of fluorine groups into their original structures, and significant progress has been made during the last three decades towards the development of practical procedures for the introduction of fluorine. The replacement of the fluorine atoms present in pharmaceuticals with radioactive F-18 atoms is a rational approach for designing novel PET tracers. As a fluorine-containing pharmaceutical agent, pitavastatin has attracted considerable interest from researchers working in the life sciences because it can act as an antihyperlipidemic agent as well as a substrate for hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (hOATP). With this in mind, it was envisaged that [F-18]pitavastatin would be used as an excellent imaging agent for hOATP, which prompted us to investigate the synthesis of this agent. Herein, we report a practical method for the synthesis of [F-18]pitavastatin by the Suzuki coupling reaction of p-iodofluorobenzene and a quinoline boronate derivative, with the desired product being formed in a radiochemical yield of 12 +/- 3% (decay corrected from [F-18]fluoride ions, n = 3).

First, binding studies performed with a non selective vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) radioligand indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites. Second, OTR mRNA was detected by RT-PCR analysis whereas transcripts for AVP V1a, V1b or V2 receptors (V1aR, V1bR and V2R respectively) were not detected. Third, the presence of functional OTRs was evidenced by showing that agonist substances having a high affinity for the human OTR, namely OT, AVP and LThr4,Gly7]OT, increased the rate of myoblasts fusion and myotubes formation in the cultures, whereas F180, a V1aR selective agonist, and dDAVP, a V2R agonist had no significant effect on the fusion process. In addition, we show by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry that the OT gene is expressed in cultured myoblasts. Taken together, our data suggest that OT may act as a paracririe/autocrine agent that stimulates the fusion of human myoblasts in vitro. In vivo, OT may be involved in the differentiation. of human skeletal muscle during postnatal growth, and possibly its regeneration following injury.

While both of these techniques have been used in the past, there is no direct and systematic comparison. In the first direct comparison of these two methods we find that the dose of haloperidol required for blocking 50% of the dopamine D-2 receptors was 0.02 mg/kg/sc (95% CIT 0.018-0.022 mg/kg)as measured using H-3-raclopride method; but was significantly higher with the EEDQ method 0.24 mg/kg/s.c. (95% CI 0.048-0.224 mg/kg). The H-3-raclopride method showed significantly lesser variance (p = 0.02) despite the higher sensitivity. This seven-fold difference in the sensitivity of the two techniques to measure antipsychotic-induced D-2 occupancy explains discrepancies in the previous studies which have used these two methods and also suggest that for future studies the H-3-raclopride method is a move sensitive and, likely, a more valid reflector of true receptor occupancy.

Western blot analysis of irradiated holoenzyme R1 and R2 yielded target sizes of 281 kDa and 57 kDa (approximately twice their expected size). Irradiation of free R1 and analysis by all methods yielded a single exponential decay with target sizes ranging from 128-153 kDa. For free R2, quantitation by enzyme activity and Western blot analyses yielded simple inactivation curves but considerably different target sizes of 223 kDa and 19 kDa, respectively; competition for radioligand binding in irradiated R2 subunits yielded two species, one with a target size of similar to 210 kDa and the other of similar to 20 kDa. These results are consistent with a model in which there is radiation energy transfer between the two monomers of both Fl and R2 only in the holoenzyme, a radiation-induced loss of free radical only in the isolated R2, and an alteration of the tertiary structure of R2.

Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors with significant ancillary A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR) antagonistic properties were further developed to exhibit additional phosphodiesterase-4 and -10 (PDE4/10) inhibition and/or dopamine D-2 receptor (D2R) agonistic activity. While all of the designed compounds showed MAO-B inhibition in the nanomolar range mostly combined with submicromolar A(2A)AR affinity, significant enhancement of PDE-inhibitory and D2R-agonistic activity was additionally reached for some compounds through various structural modifications. The final multitarget drugs also showed promising antioxidant properties in vitro. In order to evaluate their potential neuroprotective effect, representative ligands were tested in a cellular model of toxin-induced neurotoxicity. As a result, protective effects against oxidative stress in neuroblastoma cells were observed, confirming the utility of the applied strategy. Further evaluation of the newly developed multitarget ligands in preclinical models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases is warranted.

In the present chapter evidence for direct physical interactions of this receptor with various GPCRs have been described. The most interesting in the context of antipsychotic drug action mechanism is the interaction of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor with dopamine D2 receptor, which has been shown both in vitro as well as in the native brain tissue. On the other hand, new understanding of hallucinogenic drugs has been proposed by providing data which demonstrate the formation of heterocomplexes by the 5-HT2A receptor with the metabotropic glutamatergic receptor mGluR2. Methodology used in GPCRs heterodimerization studies has evolved, from radioligand binding, receptor crosslinking, receptor complementation, or co-immunoprecipitation approach to biophysical techniques based on resonance energy transfer-each having their pros and cons, however their use still provides new exciting data concerning the complexity of GPCRs physical interactions, which broaden basal knowledge as well as offer new targets for pharmacological intervention.

Type 5 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlur5) is abundant in brain regions known to be involved in drug reinforcement, yet very little has been published on mGluR1/5 expression in alcoholics. We evaluated the densities of mGluR1/5 binding in the hippocampus and striatum of post-mortem human brains by using [H-3]Quisqualic acid as a radioligand in whole hemispheric autoradiography of Cloninger type 1 (n=9) and 2 (n=8) alcoholics and healthy controls (n=10). We observed a 30-40% higher mGluR1/5 binding density in the CA2 area of hippocampus in type 1 alcoholics when compared with either type 2 alcoholics or healthy subjects. Although preliminary, and from a relatively small number of subjects from these diagnostic groups, these results suggest that the mGluR1/5 receptors may be increased in type 1 alcoholics in certain brain areas.

Increasing clinical demands stipulate an active search for efficient and selective Kv1.3 blockers. Here we present a new, reliable, and easy-to-use analytical system designed to seek for and study Kv1.3 ligands that bind to the extracellular vestibule of the K+-conducting pore. It is based on Escherichia coli spheroplasts with the hybrid protein KcsA-Kv1.3 embedded into the membrane, fluorescently labeled Kv1.3 blocker agitoxin-2, and confocal laser scanning microscopy as a detection method. This system is a powerful alternative to radioligand and patch-clamp techniques. It enables one to search for Kv1.3 ligands both among individual compounds and in complex mixtures, as well as to characterize their affinity to Kv1.3 channel using the "mix and read" mode. To demonstrate the potential of the system, we performed characterization of several known Kv1.3 ligands, tested nine spider venoms for the presence of Kv1.3 ligands, and conducted guided purification of a channel blocker from scorpion venom.

Employing fluorescence detected coimmunoprecipitation and radioligand binding experiments, we herein demonstrate that coexpression of dopamine D-2L receptor and the neurotensin receptor subtype NTS1 leads to physical interaction and the formation of heteromers in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. In this in vitro system, a trans-inhibitory effect on the agonist binding affinity of D-2 was observed in presence of neurotensin. To correlate between the functional properties of dopaminergic agents and the magnitude of neurotensin-induced modulation of D-2L binding affinities in cells coexpressing D-2L and NTS1, a structurally diverse set of dopamine receptor agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists was tested. Ligand specific profiles indicating substantial bias between ligand efficacy and transmodulation were discovered, suggesting a heteromerization-based functional selectivity. In the presence of neurotensin, the novel D-2 agonist FAUC 326 displayed a 34-fold decrease of binding affinity in cells coexpressing D-2L and NTS1.

In light of the fact that obesity is one of the major health problems plaguing the modern society, the ghrelin signaling system continues to remain an important and attractive pharmacological target for the treatment of obesity. In vivo imaging of the GHSR could shed light on the mechanism by which ghrelin affects feeding behavior and thus offers a new therapeutic perspective for the development of effective treatments. Recently, a series of piperidine-substituted quinazolinone derivatives was reported to be selective and potent GHSR antagonists with high binding affinities. Described herein is the synthesis, in vitro, and in vivo evaluation of (S)-6-(4-fluorophenoxy)-3-((1-[C-11]methylpiperidin-3-yl)methyl)-2-o-tolylquinazolin-4(3H)-one ([C-11]1), a potential PET radioligand for imaging GHSR.

In in vivo experiments with nude mice bearing tumours of these NHL cell lines, the efficacy of cytotoxic LHRH analogue AN-207 and its cytotoxic radical AN-201 was examined. LHRH receptors were detected in 94.1% of the human NHL specimens and in both NHL cell lines. AN-207 significantly (P < 0.01) inhibited the growth of RL and HT tumours, while the non-targeted AN-201 had no effects. Blockade of the LHRH receptors with an excess of LHRH agonist Decapeptyl suppressed the antitumour effects of AN-207. Our findings indicate that LHRH receptors expressed in a high percentage of human NHL specimens can be used for effective targeted therapy with the cytotoxic LHRH analogue AN-207.

Membranous EGFR levels were examined by radioligand binding assays in 110 patients with gastric cancer. The mean follow-up period was 30.7 months. EGFR levels of tumors ranged widely, from 0.3 to 510 fmol/mg protein. EGFR levels were significantly higher (p <0.0005) in neoplastic tissue than in paired adjacent mucosa samples (median) (n=84; 8.7 vs. 3.9 fmol/mg protein). Intratumoral EGFR levels were significantly correlated with tumor stage (p <0.05), and were higher in patients with stage III tumors (median) (7.6, 6.4, 12.3 and 7.5 fmol/mg protein for stages I, II, III and IV, respectively). In addition, the tumor/mucosa ratios of the EGFR content were significantly higher (p <0.05) in patients with stage III tumors (1, 1.8, 3.9, and 0.92, respectively). Although there was no significant relationship between EGFR levels of tumors and overall survival, the results suggest a role for EGFR in tumor progression of gastric cancer.

We performed initial brain kinetic modeling of the novel PDE10A tracer F-18-JNJ-42259152 (2-[[4-[1-(2-F-18-fluoroethyl)-4-(4-pyridinyl)-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]phenoxy]methyl]-3,5-dimethyl-pyridine) and studied test-retest reproducibility in healthy volunteers. Methods: Twelve healthy volunteers (5 men, 7 women; age range, 42-77 y) were scanned dynamically up to 135 min after bolus injection of 172.5 +/- 10.3 MBq of F-18-JNJ42259152. Four volunteers (2 men, 2 women) underwent retest scanning, with a mean interscan interval of 37 d. Input functions and tracer parent fractions were determined using arterial sampling and high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Volumes of interest for the putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, thalamus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum were delineated using individual volumetric T1 MR imaging scans. One-tissue (1T) and 2-tissue (2T) models were evaluated to calculate total distribution volume (V-T). Simplified models were also tested to calculate binding potential (BPND), including the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and multilinear reference tissue model, using the frontal cortex as the optimal reference tissue. The stability of V-T and BPND was assessed down to a 60-min scan time. Results: The average intact tracer half-life in blood was 90 min. The 2T model V-T values for the putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, substantia nigra, thalamus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum were 1.54 +/- 0.37, 0.90 +/- 0.24, 0.64 +/- 0.18, 0.42 +/- 0.09, 0.35 +/- 0.09, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and 0.36 +/- 0.12, respectively. The 1T model provided significantly lower V-T values, which were well correlated to the 2T V-T. SRTM BPND values referenced to the frontal cortex were 3.45 +/- 0.43, 1.78 +/- 0.35, 1.10 +/- 0.31, and 0.44 +/- 0.09 for the respective target regions putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, and substantia nigra, with similar values for the multilinear reference tissue model. Good correlations were found for the target regions putamen, caudate nucleus, ventral striatum, and substantia nigra between the 2T-compartment model BPND and the SRTM BPND (r = 0.57, 0.82, 0.70, and 0.64, respectively). SRTM BPND using a 90- and 60-min acquisition interval showed low bias. Test-retest variability was 5%-19% for 2T V-T and 5%-12% for BPND SRTM. Conclusion: Kinetic modeling of F-18-JNJ-42259152 shows that PDE10A activity can be reliably quantified and simplified using a reference tissue model with the frontal cortex as reference and a 60-min acquisition period.

A prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted prodrug with a favorable in vivo toxicity profile	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							TARGETED ALPHA-THERAPY; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; CATHEPSIN-B; PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY; EXPERIMENTAL-MODELS; DOSIMETRY ESTIMATE; PSMA EXPRESSION; CANCER; ANTIBODY; DRUG	Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a promising target for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer (PC) and various solid tumors. Although PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT) has enabled significant imaging and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) responses, accumulating clinical data are beginning to reveal certain limitations, including a subgroup of non-responders, relapse, radiation-induced toxicity, and the need for specialized facilities for its administration. To date non-radioactive attempts to leverage PSMA to treat PC with antibodies, nanomedicines or cell-based therapies have met with modest success. We developed a non-radioactive prodrug, SBPD-1, composed of a small-molecule PSMA-targeting moiety, a cancer-selective cleavable linker, and the microtubule inhibitor monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). SBPD-1 demonstrated high binding affinity to PSMA (K-i=8.84 nM) and selective cytotoxicity to PSMA-expressing PC cell lines (IC50=3.90 nM). SBPD-1 demonstrated a significant survival benefit in two murine models of human PC relative to controls. The highest dose tested did not induce toxicity in immunocompetent mice. The high specific targeting ability of SBPD-1 to PSMA-expressing tumors and its favorable toxicity profile warrant its further development.

However, recent in vivo radioligand binding studies and large-scale transcriptomics in post-mortem brain report reduced markers of microglial inflammation. The findings suggest a contrary hypothesis; that microglia are diverted into their noninflammatory synaptic remodelling phenotype that interferes with neurodevelopment and perhaps contributes to the relapsing nature of schizophrenia. Recent discoveries on the regulatory interactions between micro- and astroglial cells and immune regulatory T cells (Tregs) cohere with clinical omics data to suggest that: i) disinhibited astrocytes mediate the shift in microglial phenotype via the production of transforming growth factorbeta, which also contributes to the disturbances of dopamine and GABA function in schizophrenia, and ii) systemically impaired functioning of Treg cells contributes to the dysregulation of glial function, the low-grade peripheral inflammation, and the hitherto unexplained predisposition to auto-immunity and reduced lifeexpectancy in schizophrenia, including greater COVID-19 mortality.

The central nervous system and the immune system are the main adaptive systems, which participate in a continuous and functional crosstalk to guarantee homeostasis. On binding to its 5 dopamine receptors, dopamine acts as a co-regulator of the immune system, contributing to the interaction of the central nervous system and inflammatory events and as a source of communication between the different immune cells. Dopaminergic perturbations in the central nervous system are observed in several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Schizophrenia is one of the most common mental disorders with a poorly understood pathoaetiology that includes genetic and environmental components that promote alterations in the dopaminergic system. Interestingly, abnormalities in dopamine receptors expression in lymphocytes of schizophrenia patients have been reported, often significantly correlating with the severity of the psychotic illness. Here, we review the current literature regarding the dopaminergic system in human lymphocytes and its alterations in schizophrenia.	[Penedo, M.

Positron emission tomography radioligands for translocator protein-18kDa such as [F-18] DPA-714 are noninvasive biomarkers of glial activation, a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Methods: [F-18] DPA-714 positron emission tomography imaging was performed in 5 baboons at baseline and 2 hours after i.m. morphine injection (1 mg/kg). Brain kinetics and metabolite-corrected input function were measured to estimate [F-18] DPA-714 brain distribution. Results: Morphine significantly increased [F-18] DPA-714 brain distribution by a 1.3 factor (P<.05; paired t test). The effect was not restricted to opioid receptor-rich regions. Differences in baseline [F-18] DPA-714 binding were observed among baboons. The response to morphine predominated in animals with the highest baseline uptake. Conclusions: [F-18] DPA-714 positron emission tomography imaging may be useful to noninvasively investigate the brain immune component of morphine pharmacology. Correlation between baseline brain distribution and subsequent response to morphine exposure suggest a role for priming parameters in controlling the neuroinflammatory properties of opioids.

Here we developed three PET tracers: 4-halogeno-N-[4-[6-(isopropylamino)pyrimidin-4-yl]-1,3-thiazol- 2-yl]-N-[C-11]methylbenzamide ([C-11]4-6), which exhibited high uptake in target tumor and decreased uptake in nontarget brain tissues. In vitro binding assay indicated high to moderate binding affinities of 4-6 (K-i, 22-143 nM) for mGlu1 receptor. In vivo biodistribution studies in mice implanted with B16F10 melanoma cells confirmed high radioactive uptake in tumor and low uptake in blood, skin, and muscles. Inhibition of mGlu1 receptor using an mGlu1-selective ligand led to reduced radioactive uptake in the tumor. [C-11]6 displayed the highest ratio of uptake between tumor and nontarget tissue and may prove useful as a PET tracer for mGlu1 imaging in melanoma.

Antihypertensive Mechanism of Lactoferrin-Derived Peptides: Angiotensin Receptor Blocking Effect	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY			English	Article						bovine lactoferrin hydrolysate; lactoferrin-derived peptides; antihypertensive mechanism; renin angiotensin system; angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition; arigiotensin receptor blocker	LONG-TERM INTAKE; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; ENZYME-INHIBITION; II AT(1); HYDROLYSATE; ENDOTHELIN; BINDING; IDENTIFICATION; HYPERTENSION; PHARMACOLOGY	Looking for antihypertensive mechanisms beyond ACE inhibition, we assessed whether lactoferrin (LF)-derived peptides can act as receptor blockers to inhibit vasoconstriction induced by angiotensin II or endothelin-1. The lactoferricin B (LfcinB)-derived peptide LfcinB(20-25). (RRWQWR), the low molecular weight LF hydrolysate (LFH < 3 kDa), and two peptides identified in LFH < 3 kDa (LIWKL and RPYL) were tested in ex vivo assays of vasoactive responses. The peptide RPYL was tested in radioligand receptor binding assays. Both LFH < 3 kDa and individual peptides inhibited angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction. RPYL showed the highest ex vivo inhibitory effect and also inhibited binding of [I-125]-(Sar(1),Ile(8))-angiotensin II to AT, receptors. By contrast, neither LFH < 3 kDa nor RPYL inhibited endothelin-1 and depolarization-induced vasoconstrictions. In conclusion, LF-derived peptides selectively inhibit angiotensin II-induced vasoconstriction by blocking angiotensin AT(1) receptors. Therefore, inhibition of angiotensin II-induced vasocontriction is suggested as a mechanism contributing along with ACE inhibition to the antihypertensive effect of some LF-derived peptides.

Both of them displayed high binding affinity to A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i = 10.0 +/- 1.4 nM for 4a, K-i = 5.3 +/- 3.2 nM for 4b). The specific and high binding of [F-18]4a and [F-18]4b to A beta plaques was confirmed by in vitro autoradiography on brain sections of AD human and transgenic mice. In biodistribution in normal mice, [F-18]4a displayed high initial brain uptake (8.17% ID/g at 2 min) and rapid washout from the brain. These preliminary results suggest [F-18]4a may be a potential PET imaging agent for AI plaques in the living human brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

In frontal cortex, the main brain area affected in PiD, A(1)Rs, determined by radioligand binding, Western blotting and real-time PCR assays, were significantly increased in PiD samples, suggesting up-regulation of this receptor. AC activity was determined in basal and stimulated conditions via stimulatory guanine nucleotide binding proteins (Gs) using GTP, or directly with forskolin. Basal AC activity was reduced in brains from PiD cases. This agrees with the decrease in AC type I (AC I) level detected by Western blotting. However, inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC activity by a selective A(1)R agonist was significantly increased in brains from PiD. In occipital cortex, adenosine A(1)R numbers were similar in control and PiD cases, and no significant differences were found in A(1)R-mediated AC inhibition. These results show that the adenosine A(1)R-AC transduction pathway is specifically up-regulated and sensitized in frontal cortex brain in PiD.

A bulky alkyl substituent in the C-8 position of the tetrahydroisoquinoline produces a clear increase in the affinity for the apamin sensitive binding sites. The presence of an electron-withdrawing group in the C-5 and C-8 positions is not a suitable substitution for the affinity of drugs structurally related to N-methyl-laudanosine. Thiophenic analogues and 8-methoxy derivatives possess a poor affinity for the apamin sensitive binding sites. Electrophysiological studies performed with the most effective compound showed a blockade of the apamin sensitive afterhyperpolarization in rat dopaminergic neurons.

For quantification of regional serotonin transporter a ratio of specific to non-specific [I-123]beta-CIT-binding was used. The availability of serotonin transporter was calculated using regions of interests (ROI) for thalamus/hypothalamus, midbrain, brainstem (highest density of serotonin transporter) and cerebellum as a reference. The mean specific to non-specific [I-123]beta-CIT binding ratios in the thalamic/hypothalamic ROI were 4.95 +/- 0.57 (OCD patients), and 5.48 +/- 0.87 (control group). The mean ratios in the midbrain ROI were 3.51 +/- 0.45 (OCD patients) and 4.89 +/- 1.23 (controls) and in the brainstem ROI the ratios were 2.38 +/- 0.76 (OCD patients) and 3.53 +/- 1.01 (controls). This in vivo finding of significant reduced serotonin transporter availability in midbrain/brainstem using [I-123] beta-CIT SPECT further supports the serotonin deficit hypothesis of OCD.

While mounting evidence suggests a role for neuroinflammation, no study has directly provided evidence of brain glial activation in FM. In this study, we conducted a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) study using [C-11]PBR28, which binds to the translocator protein (TSPO), a protein upregulated in activated microglia and astrocytes. To enhance statistical power and generalizability, we combined datasets collected independently at two separate institutions (Massachusetts General Hospital [MGH] and Karolinska Institutet [KI]). In an attempt to disentangle the contributions of different glial cell types to FM, a smaller sample was scanned at KI with [C-11]-L-deprenyl-D2 PET, thought to primarily reflect astrocytic (but not microglial) signal. Thirty-one FM patients and 27 healthy controls (HC) were examined using [C-11]PBR28 PET. 11 FM patients and 11 HC were scanned using [C-11]-L-deprenyl-D2 PET. Standardized uptake values normalized by occipital cortex signal (SUVR) and distribution volume (V-T) were computed from the [C-11]PBR28 data. [C-11]-L-deprenyl-D2 was quantified using lambda k(3). PET imaging metrics were compared across groups, and when differing across groups, against clinical variables. Compared to HC, FM patients demonstrated widespread cortical elevations, and no decreases, in [C-11]PBR28 ITT and SUVR, most pronounced in the medial and lateral walls of the frontal and parietal lobes. No regions showed significant group differences in [C-11]-L-deprenyl-Ds signal, including those demonstrating elevated [C-11] PBR28 signal in patients (p's >= 0.53, uncorrected). The elevations in [C-11]PBR28 V-T and SUVR were correlated both spatially (i.e., were observed in overlapping regions) and, in several areas, also in terms of magnitude. In exploratory, uncorrected analyses, higher subjective ratings of fatigue in FM patients were associated with higher [C-11] PBR28 SUVR in the anterior and posterior middle cingulate cortices (p's < 0.03). SUVR was not significantly associated with any other clinical variable. Our work provides the first in vivo evidence supporting a role for glial activation in FM pathophysiology. Given that the elevations in [C-11]PBR28 signal were not also accompanied by increased [C-11]-deprenyl-D2 signal, our data suggests that microglia, but not astrocytes, may be driving the TSPO elevation in these regions. Although [C-11]-L-deprenyl-D2 signal was not found to be increased in FM patients, larger studies are needed to further assess the role of possible astrocytic contributions in FM. Overall, our data support glial modulation as a potential therapeutic strategy for FM.

Structure-Affinity Relationships and Structure-Kinetics Relationships of Pyrido[2,1-<i>f</i>]purine-2,4-dione Derivatives as Human Adenosine A<sub>3</sub> Receptor Antagonists	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY; CLICK CHEMISTRY; LIGAND; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; THERMODYNAMICS; GPCRDB	We expanded on a series of pyrido[2,1-f]purine-2,4-clione derivatives as human adenosine A(3) receptor (hA(3)R) antagonists to determine their kinetic profiles and affinities. Many compounds showed high affinities and a diverse range of kinetic profiles. We found hA(3)R antagonists with very short residence time (RT) at the receptor (2.2 min for 5) and much longer RTs (e.g., 376 min for 27 or 391 min for 31). Two representative antagonists (5 and 27) were tested in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays, and their RTs appeared correlated to their (in)surmountable antagonism. From a k(on)-k(off)-K-D kinetic map, we divided the antagonists into three subgroups, providing a possible direction for the further development of hA(3)R antagonists. Additionally, we performed a computational modeling study that sheds light on the crucial receptor interactions, dictating the compounds' binding kinetics. Knowledge of target binding kinetics appears useful for developing and triaging new hA(3)R antagonists in the early phase of drug discovery.	[Xia, Lizi; Burger, Wessel A.

In this study, we found that FAM3D strongly chemoattracted human peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes. To identify the FAM3D receptor, we used chemotaxis, receptor internalization, Ca2+ flux and radioligand-binding assays in FAM3D-stimulated HEK293 cells that transiently expressed formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 1 or FPR2 to show that FAM3D was a high affinity ligand of these receptors, both of which were highly expressed on the surface of neutrophils, and monocytes and macrophages. After being injected into the mouse peritoneal cavity, FAM3D chemoattracted CD11b+ Ly6G+ neutrophils in a short time. In response to FAM3D stimulation, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and phosphorylated p38 MAPK family proteins were upregulated in the mouse neutrophils, and this increase was inhibited upon treatment with an inhibitor of FPR1 or FPR2. FAM3D has been reported to be constitutively expressed in the gastrointestinal tract. We found that FAM3D expression increased significantly during colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium. Taken together, we propose that FAM3D plays a role in gastrointestinal homeostasis and inflammation through its receptors FPR1 and FPR2.

SEE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CHEMICAL GENOMICS; CONNECTIVITY MAP; TARGET IDENTIFICATION; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; SMALL MOLECULES	We have devised a chemocentric informatics methodology for drug discovery integrating independent approaches to mining biomolecular databases. As a proof of concept, we have searched for novel putative cognition enhancers. First, we generated Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models of compounds binding to 5-hydroxytryptamine-6 receptor (5-HT6R), a known target for cognition enhancers, and employed these models for virtual screening to identify putative 5-HT6R actives. Second, we queried chemogenomics data from the Connectivity Map (http://www.broad.mit.edu/cmap/) with the gene expression profile signatures of Alzheimer's disease patients to identify compounds putatively linked to the disease. Thirteen common hits were tested in 5-HT6R radioligand binding assays and ten were confirmed as actives. Four of them were known selective estrogen receptor modulators that were never reported as 5-HT6R ligands. Furthermore, nine of the confirmed actives were reported elsewhere to have memory-enhancing effects. The approaches discussed herein can be used broadly to identify novel drug-target-disease associations.

This study was designed to develop new radioligands for imaging of CB2 receptor in cancer using biomedical imaging technique positron emission tomography ( PET). Carbon-11-labeled 2-oxoquinoline and 2-chloroquinoline derivatives, [C-11]6a-d and [C-11] 9a-d, were prepared by O-[C-11] methylation of their corresponding precursors using [C-11]CH3OTf under basic conditions and isolated by a simplified solid-phase extraction (SPE) method in 40-50% radiochemical yields based on [C-11]CO2 and decay corrected to end of bombardment (EOB). The overall synthesis time from EOB was 15-20 min, the radiochemical purity was >99%, and the specific activity at end of synthesis (EOS) was 111-185 GBq/mu mol.

We developed a radiosynthesis for the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitor [C-11]RAL-01. Whole body distribution studies using positron emission tomography (PET) revealed a time-dependant passage through the liver and accumulation of radioactivity in the bile of the Landrace pig. Displaceable binding was readily discerned in the myocardium, and traces of binding were seen in pulmonary tissue, consistent with the use of this class of drug in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. [C-11]RAL-01 readily entered the brain and obtained an equilibrium distribution volume of 4-5 ml g(-1). Mean parametric images suggested the presence of a small displaceable binding component, but this binding was not significant in the present group of three pigs. Thus, [C-11]RAL-01 shows considerable promise for PET studies of biliary elimination and of PDE5 binding in the cardiovascular system. However, analogues of higher affinity may be required for investigations of central nervous system binding sites. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Radioligand binding data has,shown that BU98008 is a highly selective imidazoline(1)-binding site ligand with 300 fold selectively for the imidazoline(1)-binding site relative to alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. However, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonists are known to induce hypothermia, therefore, the present study has investigated the ability of the selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, RX811059 (2-ethoxy idazoxan) and the mixed imidazoline(1)-binding site/alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, efaroxan, to attenuate the BU98008-induced hypothermia. Preliminary experiments confirmed that BU98008 induced a dose-dependent decrease in body temperature in mice at 10 and 20 mg/kg. The response was not affected by pre-treatment with RX811059 but was significantly attenuated following pre-treatment with efaroxan. These data suggest that BU98008-induced hypothermia is mediated by activation of imidazoline(1)-binding site. Body temperature may therefore provide a novel assay for investigating agonist and antagonist action at the imidazoline(1)-binding site. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that HAEC natively expressed D-1 receptor mRNA, as measured by RT-PCR, which was identical to that of human brain. Saturation binding studies using [H-3]SCH 23390 demonstrated the presence of a high affinity D-1 site in HAEC with K-D and B-max values of 2.01 +/- 0.25 nM and 32.5 +/- 3.7 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Competition studies showed that selective D-1 antagonists were potent displacers of [H-3]SCH 23390 binding with a potency order consistent with D-1 receptor characteristics. The current results present compelling evidence that HAEC natively express D-1 receptor mRNA and binding sites. The results also establish a primate cell model that can possibly be used for studying D-1 receptor signal transduction and molecular mechanisms and exploring newly developed drugs acting at these receptors.

It was 83-fold less potent at the alpha (1B)-adrenoceptor subtype expressed in the rat spleen, and was inactive at the alpha (1A)-adrenoceptor subtype expressed in the rat vas deferens. Radioligand binding assays also revealed high affinity (pK(i) = 8.71) for the alpha (1D)-adrenoceptor subtype and weaker affinities at the alpha (1A)-adrenoceptor (pK(i) = 6.23) and alpha (1B)-adrenoceptor (pK(i) = 7.86). In comparison to its potent affinity at the alpha (1D)-adrenoceptor subtype, A-315456 was 3020-, 794- and 38-fold weaker at the dopamine D-2-, 5-HT1A-, and alpha (2a)-adrenoceptors, respectively. These studies indicate that A-315456 is a potent and selective alpha (1D)-antagonist that may serve as a useful pharmacological ligand to probe the physiological role of the alpha (1D)-adrenoceptor subtype in normal and disease states.

[I-125]LTT-SRIF-28 labels significantly more sites than [I-125]Tyr(10) -cortistatin-14 and [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide as seen previously in cells expressing pure populations Of sst(2) or sst(5) receptors. 3 SRIF analogues displaced the binding of the four radioligands. sst(2/5) receptor-selective ligands showed much higher affinity than sst(1/3/4) receptor-selective ligands. The binding profile of [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide was different from that of [I-125]LTT-SRIF-28, [I-125]CGP 23996 and [I-125]Tyr(10)-cortistatin-14. The sst(5/1) receptor-selective ligand L-817,818 identified two binding sites, one with subnanomolar affinity (sst(5) receptors) and one with micromolar affinity (sst(2) receptors); however, the proportions were different: 70 - 80% high affinity with [I-125]LTT-SRIF-28, [I-125]CGP 23996, [I-125]Tyr(10)-cortistatin-14, but only 20% with [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide. 4 SRIF analogues inhibited the forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels depending on concentration. sst(2/5) receptor-selective ligands were highly potent, whereas sst(1/3/4) receptor-selective ligands had no significant effects. The sst(2) receptor antagonist D-Tyr(8)-CYN 154806 competitively antagonised the effects of SRIF-14 and sst(2) receptor-preferring agonists, but not those of L-817,818. 5 The complex binding properties of SRIF receptor analogues indicate that sst(2) and sst(5) receptors are the predominant SRIF receptors expressed on AtT-20 cell membranes with no or only negligible presence of sst(1), sst(3) and sst(4) receptors. In the functional studies using cAMP accumulation, only sst(2) and sst(5) receptors appear to play a role. However, the 'predominant' receptor appears to be the sst(2) receptor, although sst(5) receptors can also mediate the effect, when the ligand is not able to activate sst(2) receptors. This clearly adds flexibility to SRIF-mediated functional effects and suggests that the physiological role of SRIF and its analogues may be mediated preferentially via one subtype over another.

Since then, radioiodine has become broadly established clinically for diagnostic imaging and therapy of benign and malignant thyroid disease, worldwide. How-ever, only since the approval of SSTR2-targeting theranostics follow-ing the NETTER-1 trial in neuroendocrine tumors, and the positive outcome of the VISION trial has theranostics gained substantial attention beyond nuclear medicine. The roll-out of radioligand ther-apy for treating a high-incidence tumor such as prostate cancer requires the expansion of existing and the establishment of new theranostics centers. Despite wide global variation in the regulatory, financial and medical landscapes, this guide attempts to provide valuable information to enable interested stakeholders to safely initi-ate and operate theranostic centers. This enabling guide does not intend to answer all possible questions, but rather to serve as an overarching framework for multiple, more detailed future initiatives. It recognizes that there are regional differences in the specifics of regu-lation of radiation safety, but common elements of best practice valid globally.

It is of great significance to enhance the response rate of ICB in cancer patients. Here, a radioiodinated anti-PD-L1 antibody (I-131-alpha PD-L1) was developed for PD-LI-targeted single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and alpha PD-L1 immunotherapy. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence staining were performed to identify PD-L1 upregulation in a time- and dose-dependent manner after being induced by I-131-alpha PD-L1. ImmunoSPECT imaging and biodistributions of I-131-alpha PD-L1 in CT26, MC38, 4T1, and B16F10 tumor models were conducted to visualize the high tumor uptake and low background signal. Compared to monotherapy alone, concurrent administration of alpha PD-L1 mAb and I-131-alpha PD-L1 revealed improved tumor control in murine tumor models. The combination of 11.1 MBq of I-131-alpha PD-L1 and 200 mu g of alpha PD-L1 mAb resulted in significant tumor growth delay and prolonged survival. This radioligand synergized immunotherapy strategy holds great potential for cancer management.

A radioligand able to measure cardiac cholinergic activity would be an invaluable clinical and research tool since cholinergic dysfunction has been associated with a wide array of pathologies (e.g., chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmias). [F-18]Fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol (FEOBV) is a cholinergic radiotracer that has been extensively validated in the brain. Whether FEOBV PET can be used to assess cholinergic activity in the heart is not known. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the properties of FEOBV for cardiac PET imaging and cholinergic activity mapping. PET data were collected for 40 minutes after injection of 230 +/- 50 MBq of FEOBV in four healthy participants (1 female; Age: 37 +/- 10; BMI: 25 +/- 2). Dynamic LV time activity curves were fitted with Logan graphical, 1-tissue compartment, and 2-tissue compartment models, yielding similar distribution volume estimates for each participant. Our initial data show that FEOBV PET has favorable tracer kinetics for quantification of cholinergic activity and is a promising new method for assessing parasympathetic function in the heart.

We synthesized and characterized the high-affinity D2high ligand [H-3]MCL-536 in competition binding against the D2/3 agonist (R-(-)-N-n-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) and the D2/3 antagonist raclopride. The total binding of [H-3]MCL-536 (minus that in presence of 100nM NPA) was measured by saturation binding in CHO cells expressing human D2long; the data yielded separable, non-saturable non-specific, and saturable specific, components. The former represents an aporphine site common to NPA and [H-3]MCL-536. The latter indicated specific binding to the total D2 receptors (both high and low-affinity states). [H-3]MCL-536 had a K-d of 0.8nM. In competition binding, NPA had a K-1 of 0.16nM, and a K-1 of 0.9nM for raclopride. Co-incubation with guanylylimidodiphosphate abolished binding to D2high. This unique profile makes radiolabeled MCL-536 a versatile tool for diagnostics and therapeutics, and may quantify D2high sites in schizophrenia and PD patients in vivo.

We assessed alpha(v)beta(3) in vitro and by Ga-68-DOTA-[c(RGDfK)](2) positron emission tomography (PET) in tumors with varying alpha(v)beta(3). Intrinsic alpha(v)beta(3) expression decreased in the order of M21 >>> MDA-MB-231 > M21L in cells. Tumor volume of distribution by PET, V (T), was significantly higher in M21 compared to isogenic M21L tumors (0.40 +/- 0.01 versus 0.25 +/- 0.02; p < 0.01) despite similar microvessel density (MVD) likely due to higher alpha(v)beta(3). V (T) for MDA-MB-231 (0.40 +/- 0.04) was comparable to M21 despite lower alpha(v)beta(3) but in keeping with the higher MVD, suggesting superior tracer distribution. This study demonstrates that radioligand binding kinetics of PET data can be used to discriminate tumors with different alpha(v)beta(3) integrin expression-a key component of the angiogenesis phenotype-in vivo.

It was based on micellar/high submicellar liquid chromatography (LC) using a semi-preparative alkyl-bonded silica rod column in conjunction with steep gradient and high flow rate for rapid macromolecule removal from plasma without significant sample preparation and fast/efficient separation of PET radioligands from their radiometabolites. Excellent separation of target PET radioligand from its radiometabolites was achieved within 4 min with a limit of detection of 1 Bq (Bq) level. This method was successfully applied to study the radiometabolism for a wide variety of C-11 and F-18 labeled radioligands in human or monkey plasma. The improved sensitivity and throughput permitted the analysis of a large number of plasma samples for accurate determination PET radioligands during quantitative PET imaging studies. Micellar/high submicellar LC together with a monolithic column is an attractive alternative method to determine the radiometabolism of PET radioligands in plasma. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Activation of resident microglia and infiltration of monocytes/macrophages contributes to neuronal injury and synaptic damage. Noninvasive imaging of these cells in vivo provides a means to monitor progression of disease as well as assess efficacies of potential therapeutics. This review provides an overview of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of microglia/macrophages in the brain. We describe the rationale behind PET imaging of microglia/macrophages with ligands that bind to translocator protein-18 kDa (TSPO). We discuss the prototype TSPO radioligand [C-11]PK11195, its limitations, and the development of newer TSPO ligands as PET imaging agents. PET imaging agents for targets other than TSPO are emerging, and we outline the potential of these agents for imaging brain microglia/macrophage activity in vivo. Finally, we briefly summarize advances in MR imaging of microglia/macrophages using iron oxide nanoparticles and ultra-small super paramagnetic particles that are phagocytosed.

The cell membrane of guinea pig myocardium membrane was immobilized on the surface of the silica carrier as the cell membrane stationary phase (CMSP) for the rapid on-line chromatographic evaluation of ligand binding affinity to beta-AR. The affinity was also evaluated by functional assay using the some tissues. Correlation analysis was used to assess the correlationship of these two methods. The retention factors in guinea pig myocardium CMSP were: (-)-propranolol (33.9) > (+)-propranolol (27.0) > metopranolol (23.2) > esmolol (17.7) > practolol (13.2) > sotalol (9.56). Compared to the affinity rank orders obtained from functional assay in the same myocardium, there was a positive correlation (r(2) = 0.9729, n = 18, p < 0.0001) between both data sets. These results showed that CMC can be used to evaluate drug-receptor affinities of drug candidates as the functional assays.

Based on the nonpeptidyl, high-affinity, and selective ETAR antagonist 3-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-5-hydroxy-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)-5H-furan-2-one (PD 156707), a modification of the lead structure with a PEG-spacer containing an amino moiety was performed. Labeling of this precursor with the fluorescent marker Cy 5.5 NHS-ester was accomplished by adaption of common peptide labeling procedures. The affinity of the Cy 5.5-labeled receptor antagonist was evaluated using human carcinoma cell lines with different degrees of ETAR expression. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that ETAR-positive MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma and HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma cells effectively bind the photoprobe at very low doses (nM), while ETAR-negative MDA-MB-435 human breast cancer cells showed no fluorescence signal. Binding specificity of the probe could be demonstrated by predosing with a specific ETAR antibody or the parent antagonist PD 156707 as a competing inhibitor. The results suggest that the modified photoprobe tightly binds to ETA receptors and thus may be a possible candidate for the imaging of ETAR-overexpressing tissues in vivo.

BU224, (2-(4,5-dihydroimidaz-2-yl)-quinoline, shows high affinity and is selective for the imidazoline-2 (I-2) class of receptors. BU224 was tested in the rat Porsolt forced swim paradigm where it was found to decrease time spent immobile and increase the time spent swimming, consistent with an antidepressant profile. BU224 was tritiated and, in radioligand binding studies, was found to label a single population of saturable sites with high affinity. In vitro brain autoradiography with [H-3]BU224 also showed a pattern of distribution similar to the known labeling of I-2 receptors. A new series of four 2BFI (2-(benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline) derivatives were investigated as potential ligands for imaging brain I-2 receptors using positron emission tomography (PET). At least two, BU20012 and BU20013, retained high affinity and moderate selectivity and penetrated the brain when administered peripherally in the mouse. 2BFI has undergone the Mannich reaction to immobilized diaminodipropyl amine to fabricate an affinity column, which was used to isolate a protein from rabbit brain; this protein was sequenced and identified as the enzyme creatine kinase.

To further investigate mechanisms regulating beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)R) expression in lymphocytes, the influence of cytokines on the density of beta(2)R on purified CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes was determined in vitro. beta(2)R were determined by means of a radioligand binding assay with (I-125)iodocyanopindolol. CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes were incubated with catecholamines, interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) for 6-72h. The results demonstrate declining beta(2)R numbers on CD4(+) and CD8(+) lymphocytes in vitro augmented by epinephrine. IL-1beta has no effect on beta(2)R expression compared to medium. However, incubation with IL-2 resulted in an up-regulation of beta(2)R on CD8(+) lymphocytes. Thus, C e study demonstrates a differential regulation of beta(2)R on T-lymphocyte subpopulations with CD8(+) lymphocytes being more susceptible to mechanisms Of beta(2)R modulation than CD4(+) lymphocytes. The findings further strengthen the concept of a close interplay between the autonomic nervous system and the immune system. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Its usefulness for cortical D-1 receptor quantification in human PET studies has been questioned but has not been addressed previously. The authors tested the reproducibility of [C-11]SCH 23390 binding potential (BP) in cortical areas in five healthy volunteers using three-dimensional PET. Measurement of D-1 receptor BP was reproducible in basal ganglia, as well as in all cortical areas studied (intraclass correlation coefficients between 0.81 and 0.92). The absolute variability in cortical areas was 9.21% +/- 0.07%. The reproducibility or cortical D-1 receptor BP measurement with [C-11]SCH 23390 is equal to that observed with a more recent D-1-ligand, [C-11]NNC 112. [C-11]NNC 112 produces slightly higher specific-to-nonspecific binding ratios but has markedly slower kinetics resulting in a need for a longer scan time. These aspects should be considered when designing studies on the cortical D-1-like receptors.

This means of analysis revealed that the stability of [H-3]OFQ/N during storage varied considerably depending on the manufacturer. Furthermore, the integrity of [H-3]OFQ/N was significantly compromised in the presence of COS-7 cell membranes. Interestingly, if the peptide was added to COS-7 membranes after they had been exposed to low pH it remained intact, suggesting that the peptide's breakdown during binding is, in part, enzymatically mediated. Although a variety of protease inhibitors were tested, none proved completely effective at protecting the tritiated peptide. The intention of the studies presented here was to evaluate OFQ/N binding components, namely the available [H-3]OFQ/N ligands, in an effort to standardize the binding conditions for this receptor ligand system. Consequently, this study underscores the importance of monitoring the integrity of the trace ligand being used in a given binding assay. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The specific binding of [H-3]DHA to duck cerebral cortical membranes was found to be rapid, stable, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. Saturation analysis resulted in a linear Scatchard plot suggesting binding to a single class of receptor binding sites with high affinity (K-d = 1.18 nM) and high capacity (B-max = 162 fmol/mg protein). Competition studies showed the following relative rank order of potency of various compounds to inhibit the [H-3]DHA binding: antagonists ICI 118,551 > S(-)-propranolol much greater than betaxolol, yohimbine, WB-4101, prazosin, mianserine; agonists - isoprenaline congruent to fenoterol > salbutamol much greater than clonidine, phenylephrine. The obtained data suggest that in duck cerebral cortex beta-adrenergic receptors (like those described in brains of chick and pigeon) are of the beta(2) subtype. This is in contrast to what has been reported for the mammalian brain, where - among beta-adrenoceptors - the beta(1) subtype is predominant.

In this study, the anti-microbial, anti-leishmanial, anti-malarial and cytotoxic activities of gamma-butyrolactone derivatives: Aspernolides L (1) and M (2) and butyrolactones I (3) and VI (4) separated from Aspergillus versicolor isolated from Pulicaria crispa (Asteraceae) roots were assessed. Moreover, their radioligand displacement affinity on human cannabinoid and opioid receptors was estimated. Materials and Methods: The anti-microbial effect of compounds 1-4 was assessed against Aspergillus fumigates (A. fumigates), Cryptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), methicillin-resistant Candida albicans (C. albicans), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) and Escherichia coli (E. coli), using modified CLSI/NCCLS methods. Their anti-leishmanial capacity towards Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) as well as anti-malarial potential towards Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) [(W2, Indo-China) and (D6, Sierraleon)], using plasmodial lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH) assay were evaluated. Moreover, the binding affinity towards opioid (subtypes delta, kappa and mu) and cannabinoid (CB1 and CB2) receptors were tested using in vitro radioligand displacement assay. The cytotoxic effect was evaluated towards epidermoid (KB), malignant melanoma (SK-MEL), ovarian (SK-OV-3) and ductal (BT-549) carcinomas. Results: Compounds 1 and 2 had moderate anti-microbial effect towards C albicans, A. fumigates, E. coli and P. aeruginosa with IC50 ranged from 2.60-6.04 mM. Moreover, compounds possessed anti-leishmanial potential towards L. donovani with IC50 2.31 and 3.47 mM, respectively and IC90 5.67 and 3.89 mM, respectively compared to pentamidine. While, compound 3 displayed moderate activities towards C neoformans and A. fumigates with IC50 7.90 and 9.75 mM, respectively. On the other hand, compound 2 revealed activity towards D6 and D6 S1 clones (chloroquine-sensitive strains of P. falciparum) with IC50 2.16 and 1.43 mM, respectively. Compounds 1-4 exhibited good binding affinity towards the CB1 receptor with 71.2,80.5,69.8 and 66.1%, respectively displacement values. Moreover, compound 2 showed affinity to d-, k- and m-receptors with displacement values 61.2,73.5 and 61.3%, respectively. Furthermore, compound 1 displayed cytotoxic potential towards SK-MEL with IC50 0.70 mM and 2 exhibited the highest activity towards KB, SK-MEL, BT-549 and SKOV-3 cell lines with IC50 1.2, 0.9, 0.1 and 0.8 mM, respectively. Conclusion: Compounds 1-2 could be drug leads for anti-microbial, anti-leishmanial, cytotoxic and anti-malarial agents. The good binding affinity of 1-4 towards the CB1 receptor may also provide additional information on the possible analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties of the butyrolactones which are not reported earlier.

Neuroinflammation in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Measured Using Positron Emission Tomographic Imaging of Translocator Protein	JAMA NEUROLOGY			English	Article							VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; SPONTANEOUS SEIZURES; ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY; PET LIGAND; EPILEPTOGENESIS; TSPO	IMPORTANCE Neuroinflammation may play a role in epilepsy. Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO), a biomarker of neuroinflammation, is overexpressed on activated microglia and reactive astrocytes. A preliminary positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging study using carbon 11 ([C-11])-labeled PBR28 in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) found increased TSPO ipsilateral to seizure foci. Full quantitation of TSPO in vivo is needed to detect widespread inflammation in the epileptic brain. OBJECTIVES To determine whether patients with TLE have widespread TSPO overexpression using [C-11]PBR28 PET imaging, and to replicate relative ipsilateral TSPO increases in patients with TLE using [C-11]PBR28 and another TSPO radioligand, [C-11]DPA-713. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a cohort study from March 2009 through September 2013 at the Clinical Epilepsy Section of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, participants underwent brain PET and a subset had concurrent arterial sampling. Twenty-three patients with TLE and 11 age-matched controls were scanned with [C-11]PBR28, and 8 patients and 7 controls were scanned with [C-11]DPA-713. Patients with TLE had unilateral temporal seizure foci based on ictal electroencephalography and structural magnetic resonance imaging. Participants with homozygous low-affinity TSPO binding were excluded. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The [C-11]PBR28 distribution volume (V-T) corrected for free fraction (f(P)) was measured in patients with TLE and controls using FreeSurfer software and T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging for anatomical localization of bilateral temporal and extratemporal regions. Side-to-side asymmetry in patients with TLE was calculated as the ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral [C-11]PBR28 and [C-11]DPA-713 standardized uptake values from temporal regions. RESULTS The [C-11]PBR28 V-T to f(P) ratio was higher in patients with TLE than in controls for all ipsilateral temporal regions (27%-42%; P < .05) and in contralateral hippocampus, amygdala, and temporal pole (approximately 30%-32%; P < .05). Individually, 12 patients, 10 with mesial temporal sclerosis, had asymmetrically increased hippocampal [C-11]PBR28 uptake exceeding the 95% confidence interval of the controls. Binding of [C-11]PBR28 was increased significantly in thalamus. Relative [C-11]PBR28 and [C-11] DPA-713 uptakes were higher ipsilateral than contralateral to seizure foci in patients with TLE ([C-11]PBR28: 2%-6%; [C-11]DPA-713: 4%-9%). Asymmetry of [C-11]DPA-713 was greater than that of [C-11]PBR28 (F = 29.4; P = .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Binding of TSPO is increased both ipsilateral and contralateral to seizure foci in patients with TLE, suggesting ongoing inflammation. Anti-inflammatory therapy may play a role in treating drug-resistant epilepsy.

J	Valtchanova-Matchouganska, A; Ojewole, JAO				Valtchanova-Matchouganska, A; Ojewole, JAO			Involvement of opioid delta (δ)- and kappa (κ)-receptors in ischemic preconditioning in a rat model of myocardial infarction	METHODS AND FINDINGS IN EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						DADLE; myocardial infarction; natrindole; Nor-BNI o; pioid delta -and kappa-receptors; radioligand receptor study; U-50488H	RECEPTOR; HEART; CARDIOPROTECTION; PROTECTION; ANTAGONIST; INHIBITION; BLOCKADE; CHANNELS; SIZE; DOGS	There is controversy in the literature regarding the involvement of opioid delta (DOP, OP1)- and kappa(KOP,OP2)-receptors in ischemic preconditioning (IPC). Previous studies on this subject in our laboratories and elsewhere have been performed on either isolated heart muscles of experimental animals, or in open-heart surgery rats. To highlight this problem, we introduced an in vivo model of myocardial infarction in rats, which not only allowed electrocardiographic and enzymatic evaluation, but also morphometric assessment of myocardial infarction. In addition to these parameters, a direct receptor ligand study was undertaken, using [H-3]-DPDPE, a specific opioid delta-receptor ligand. In our pharmacodynamic studies, we used the selective opioid delta-receptor agonist D-Ala(2),D-Leu(5) enkephalin (DADLE) and antagonist natrindole. For the evaluation of opioid kappa-receptors, the selective opioid agonist U-50488H and antagonist nor-BNI were employed. Ischemic preconditioning showed the best beneficial effect, compared with pharmacological stimulation of either opioid delta- or kappa-receptors. In normal rat myocytes, two types of opioid delta-receptors exist, namely, low-affinity and high-affinity opioid receptors. In acute myocardial infarction (30-min ischemia), the low-affinity type opioid receptors disappeared, most likely as a result of receptor downregulation due to an excessive release of enkephalins. There was no change in the density of the high-affinity opioid receptor type, but their affinity significantly increased (p < 0.05) by 58%. The radioligand receptor studies showed that opioid δ(1)-receptor type was involved not only in triggering, but also in maintaining, the preconditioned state. On the basis of our pharmacodynamic studies, we suggest that both opioid δ(1)- and κ-receptors are involved in the phenomenon of IPC, but with different effects. After 30 min of left coronary artery occlusion, opioid δ-receptor agonist DADLE decreased the infarct size/area at risk from 59.80% in control, untreated, infarcted rats, to 20.40% in treated rats, without a significant effect (p > 0.05) on the occurrence of early cardiac arrhythmias. Opioid kappa-receptor agonist U-50488H produced an opposite effect on the myocardium. It decreased the infarct size/area at risk by 44%, decreased occurrence of early arrhythmias by 77% and also decreased ventricular ectopic beats by 80%. The opioid delta- and kappa-receptor agonists used in this study significantly reduced (p < 0.05) early (2 h) postinfarction mortality by 22% and 19%, respectively. Further studies are in progress to differentiate between the role of opioid κ(1)- or κ(2)-receptors and the molecular mechanisms of the effects of both opioid δ- and κ-receptors. © 2002 Prous Science.

Glutamatergic neurotransmission plays a major role in the regulation of excitatory tones in the central nervous system, although just how dietary elements contribute to the tuning of this system remains elusive. Here, we provide the first demonstration by bimodal positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) that metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) ligand binding and glutamate levels in human brains are dynamically altered in a manner dependent on food intake and consequent changes in plasma glucose levels. The brain-wide modulations of central mGluR5 ligand binding and glutamate levels and profound neuronal activations following systemic glucose administration were further proven by PET, MRS, and intravital two-photon microscopy, respectively, in living rodents. The present findings consistently support the notion that food-associated glucose intake is mechanistically linked to glutamatergic tones in the brain, which are translationally accessible in vivo by bimodal PET and MRS measurements in both clinical and non-clinical settings.

Makaluvamine G from the Marine Sponge <i>Zyzzia fuliginosa</i> Inhibits Muscle nAChR by Binding at the Orthosteric and Allosteric Sites	MARINE DRUGS			English	Article						marine natural products; nicotinic receptors; slow-channel; myasthenic	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; ION-CHANNEL; ALPHA-SUBUNIT; QUINIDINE; KINETICS; SUCCINYLCHOLINE; SELECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; ROCURONIUM	Diverse ligands of the muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) are used as muscle relaxants during surgery. Although a plethora of such molecules exists in the market, there is still a need for new drugs with rapid on/off-set, increased selectivity, and so forth. We found that pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloid Makaluvamine G (MG) inhibits several subtypes of nicotinic receptors and ionotropic gamma-aminobutiric acid receptors, showing a higher affinity and moderate selectivity toward muscle nAChR. The action of MG on the latter was studied by a combination of electrophysiology, radioligand assay, fluorescent microscopy, and computer modeling. MG reveals a combination of competitive and un-competitive inhibition and caused an increase in the apparent desensitization rate of the murine muscle nAChR. Modeling ion channel kinetics provided evidence for MG binding in both orthosteric and allosteric sites. We also demonstrated that the alpha 1 (G153S) mutant of the receptor, associated with the myasthenic syndrome, is more prone to inhibition by MG. Thus, MG appears to be a perspective hit molecule for the design of allosteric drugs targeting muscle nAChR, especially for treating slow-channel congenital myasthenic syndromes.

The BB agonist (BA) 1 binds with high affinity to the BB1R, BB2R, and BRS-3. In this communication, small molecule BBR antagonists were evaluated using human lung cancer cells. AM-37 and ST-36 inhibited binding to human BB1R, BB2R, and BRS-3 with similar affinity (Ki = 1.4-10.8 mu M). AM-13 and AM-14 were approximately an order of magnitude less potent than AM-37 and ST-36. The ability of BA1 to elevate cytosolic Ca2+ in human lung cancer cells transfected with BB1R, BB2R, and BRS-3 was antagonized by AM-37 and ST-36. BA1 increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR and ERK in lung cancer cells, which was blocked by AM-37 and ST-36. AM-37 and ST-36 reduced the growth of lung cancer cells that have BBR. The results indicate that AM-37 and ST-36 function as small molecule BB receptor antagonists.

Tau and Aβ imaging, CSF measures, and cognition in Alzheimer's disease	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							PET; BRAIN; IMPAIRMENT; BIOMARKERS; DEMENTIA; RADIOLIGAND; HYPOTHESIS; DEPOSITION; PATHOLOGY; SELECTION	Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by two molecular pathologies: cerebral beta-amyloidosis in the form of beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques and tauopathy in the form of neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads. Until recently, only A beta could be studied in humans using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging owing to a lack of tau PET imaging agents. Clinical pathological studies have linked tau pathology closely to the onset and progression of cognitive symptoms in patients with AD. We report PET imaging of tau and A beta in a cohort of cognitively normal older adults and those with mild AD. Multivariate analyses identified unique disease-related stereotypical spatial patterns (topographies) for deposition of tau and A beta. These PET imaging tau and A beta topographies were spatially distinct but correlated with disease progression. Cerebrospinal fluid measures of tau, often used to stage preclinical AD, correlated with tau deposition in the temporal lobe. Tau deposition in the temporal lobe more closely tracked dementia status and was a better predictor of cognitive performance than A beta deposition in any region of the brain. These data support models of AD where tau pathology closely tracks changes in brain function that are responsible for the onset of early symptoms in AD.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the whole-body biodistribution of radioactivity and the radiation absorbed doses to organs after intravenous injection of [C-11]FLB 457 in healthy human subjects. Methods: Whole-body images were acquired for 2 h after an injection of [C-11]FLB 457 in six healthy humans. Radiation absorbed doses were estimated by the MIRD scheme implemented in OLINDA/EXM 1.1 software. Results: Organs with the longest residence time were the liver, lungs, and brain. The organs with the highest radiation doses were the kidneys, liver, and pancreas. The effective dose delivered by [C-11]FLB 457 is 5.9 mu Sv/MBq, similar to those of other C-11-labeled tracers. Conclusions: This effective dose would allow multiple scans in the same individual based on prevailing maximum recommended-dose guidelines in the USA and Europe. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

The binding specificity, reversibility, high affinity, and limited capacity are characteristics of a CT receptor. Therefore, it was elucidated that the CT receptor might exist in the plasma membrane of the neurohypophysis of hens. The binding affinity of CT receptor increased at 30 min before oviposition and the binding capacity was decreased at 15 min before oviposition. However, no change was found in nonlaying hens during a 24-h period. Such changes in the CT receptor binding were found at 10 min after an i.v. injection of chicken CT into nonlaying hens with an increase in the blood level of AVT. The changes in the binding affinity and capacity of CT receptor of the neurohypophysis may be related to AVT release partly at oviposition time in the hen.

In order to investigate those in vivo there is an increasing interest in obtaining a metabolically stable, subtype selective and high affinity radioligand for receptor binding studies using positron emission tomography (PET). Combining the excellent in vivo properties of [C-11]MDL 100907 for PET imaging of 5-HT2A receptors and the more suitable half-life of fluorine-18, MDL 100907 was radiofluorinated in four steps using 1-(2-bromoethyl)-4-[F-18]fluorobenzene as a secondary labelling precursor. The complex reaction required an overall reaction time of 140 min and [+/-)-[F-18]MDL 100907 was obtained with a specific activity of at least 30 GBq/mu mol (EOS) and an overall radiochemical yield of 1-2%. In order to verify its binding to 5-HT2A receptors, in vitro rat brain autoradiography was conducted showing the typical distribution of 5-HT2A receptors and a very low non-specific binding of about 6% in frontal cortex, using ketanserin or spiperone for blocking. Thus, [F-18]MDL 100907 appears to be a promising new 5-HT2A PET ligand.

The novel neutral complex (TcN)-Tc-99m-MPPC combines 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) ligand as chelate moiety for Tc-99m-nitrido with a 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine moiety derived from WAY 100635 via a 3-carbon alkyl chain. This provided a reliable and reproducible method-for attaching the technetium to the pharmacophore moiety of WAY 100635. (TcN)-Tc-99m-MPPC was prepared by a two-step procedure and the radiochemical purity was found to be greater than 95%. It was hydrophilic and stable for at least 4h at room temperature. In vivo stability study in normal rats showed that no degradation of 99mTcN-MPPC was found in deproteinated blood samples at 2h post-injection. This effective Tc-99m-labelling strategy for obtaining neutral Tc-99m nitrido complexes would be a useful tool to prepare new SPECT agents to image 5-HT1A receptor with cyclam conjugated ligands.

Design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of novel bifunctional C-terminal-modified peptides for δ/μ opioid receptor agonists and neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SUBSTANCE-P RECEPTOR; ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; COUPLING-CONSTANTS; ENKEPHALIN ANALOG; SPINAL NEURONS; IN-VIVO; BINDING; SPECTROSCOPY; TOLERANCE; BIPHALIN	A series of bifunctional peptides that act as agonists for delta and mu opioid receptors with delta selectivity and as antagonist for neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors were designed and synthesized for potential application as analgesics in various pain states. The peptides were characterized using radioligand binding assays and functional assays using cell membrane and animal tissue. Optimization was performed on the fifth residue which serves as an address moiety for both receptor recognitions. It had critical effects on both activities at delta/mu opioid receptors and NK1 receptors. Among the synthesized peptides, H-Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-Met-Pro-Leu-Trp-O-3,5-Bzl(CF3) (2) (5) and H-Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-Nle-Pro-Leu-Trp-O-3,5-Bzl(CF3)(2) (7) had excellent agonist activity for both delta opioid and mu opioid receptors and excellent antagonist activity for NK1 receptors. These results indicate that the rational design of multifunctional ligands with opioid agonist and neurokinin-1 antagonist activities can be accomplished and may provide a new tool for treatment of chronic and several pain states.

Animal studies have suggested that 4-(2'-methoxyphenyl)-1-[2'-[N-(2"-pyridinyl)-p-[F-18]fluorobenzamido] ethyl] piperazine (p-MPPF) may be a suitable positron emission tomography (PET) tracer of 5-HT1A receptors. To test p-MPPF in humans, we performed 60-min dynamic PET scans in 13 healthy volunteers after single bolus injection. Metabolite quantification revealed a fast decrease in tracer plasma concentration, such that at 5 min post injection about 25% of the total radioactivity in plasma corresponded to p-MPPF. Radioactivity concentration was highest in hippocampus, intermediate in neocortex and lowest in basal ganglia and cerebellum. The interactions between p-MPPF and 5-HT1A receptors were described using linear compartmental models with plasma input and reference tissue approaches. The two quantification methods provided similar results which are in agreement with previous reports on 5-HT1A receptor brain distribution. In conclusion, our results show that p-MPPF is a suitable PET radioligand for 5-HT1A receptor human studies.

The introduction of a large alkyl group at the 4'-position of the phenyl ring, affording 2 beta -carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4'-alkylphenyl) tropane, diminished the affinity for the DAT whereas moderate 5-HTT affinity was obtained. The introduction of an iodine at the 3'-position of the 4'-alkylphenyl. affording 2 beta -carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-iodo-4'-alkylphenyl) tropane, and N-demethylation, affording 2 beta -carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-iodo-4'-alkylphenyl) nortropane. improved affinity and specificity for the 5-HTT. It could be assumed from these results that the combination of these three modifications of tropane structure yielded highly selective compounds for the 5-HTT. Of the new compounds synthesized, the most selective cocaine derivative, 2 beta -carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3'-iodo-4'-isopropylphenyl) nortropane (8d) labeled with iodine-123 or carbon-11, could be a potential ligand for exploration of the 5-HT transporter by SPET or PET.

In this study, the feasibility of solid phase chemical adsorbents for purifying [C-11]CO2 from cyclotron target gas was investigated as an alternative to physical adsorption. Silica grafted polyethyleneimine (Si-g-PEI) demonstrated a high selectivity for [C-11]CO2 at room temperature with no detectable radiochemical impurities. Capture efficiencies from cyclotron target gas were 79 +/- 12% for Si-g-PEI. Pure [C-11]CO2 was ob-tained in under 10 min via temperature-swing desorption. Si-g-PEI was easily regenerated with mild heating, though capture efficiencies decreased over multiple cycles. As a proof-of-concept, the positron emission to-mography (PET) radiopharmaceutical [C-11]SL2511.88 was successfully synthesized from Si-g-PEI purified [C-11] CO2, providing molar activities on par with conventional methods. This work presents the first reusable, solid phase chemical adsorbents for capture and purification of [C-11]CO2 under mild conditions. Future work will focus on improved material longevity using materials with high thermal and oxidative stability.

Correcting a widespread error: Neuroprotectant N-acetyl-L-tryptophan does not bind to the neurokinin-1 receptor	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						CNS injury; N -acetyl-L-tryptophan; Neurokinin-1 receptor; Neuroprotection; Substance P; Neurodegenerative diseases	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; SUBSTANCE-P; NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION; FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS; NK1 ANTAGONISTS; CEREBRAL EDEMA; DURA-MATER; INHIBITORS; BARRIER; RATS	N-acetyl-L-tryptophan (NAT) has been often shown to have neuroprotective action and other biological activities. In many of papers devoted to this compound, NAT is referenced to as an 'NK1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist' or a 'substance P (SP) antagonist'. Some of the studies treated NAT as a tool compound to interrogate NK1R function in a particular condition. Surprisingly however, no biochemical data on NAT/NK1R interaction have been available. On testing NAT in radioligand receptor binding assay, we found that this compound displays no significant binding to either human or rat NK1R up to millimolar concentrations. In light of this, the repeated claim of NAT being NK1R antagonist is an error. The use of NAT as a tool compound in NK1R-related studies should be discontinued. Some of the conclusions regarding the involvement of SP/NK1R axis in acute CNS injury or neurodegenerative diseases may then require careful rethinking. On the other hand, given interesting neuroprotective properties of NAT, the issue whether it acts by specific interactions with some molecular target or by unspecific physicochemical mechanisms needs be investigated.

Hence, searching for chemical agents with a multifunctional pharmacodynamic profile may bring highly effective therapy for CNS disorders. This study presents a deep structural insight into the hydantoin-arylpiperazine group and their serotonin/alpha-adrenergic activity. The newly synthesized compounds were tested in the radioligand binding assay and the intrinsic activity was evaluated for the selected derivatives. The computer-aided SAR analysis enabled us to answer questions about the influence of particular structural fragments on selective vs. multifunctional activity. As a result of the performed investigations, there were two leading structures: (a) compound 12 with multifunctional adrenergic-serotonin activity, which is a promising candidate to be an effective anxiolytic agent; (b) compound 14 with high alpha(1A)/alpha(1D) affinity and selectivity towards alpha(1B), which is recommended due to the elimination of probable cardiotoxic effect. The structural conclusions of this work provide significant support for future lead optimization in order to achieve the desired pharmacodynamic profile in searching for new CNS-modulating agents.

The previously described dopamine D-3 receptor ligand FAUC 329 (1) showed protective effects against dopamine depletion in a MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease. We used the radioligand [F-18]2, a [(18)]fluoroethoxy substituted analog of the lead compound 1 as a molecular tool for visualization of D-3-rich brain regions including the islands of Calleja. Furthermore, structural modifications are reported leading to the pyrimidylpiperazine derivatives 3 and 9 displaying superior subtype selectivity and preference over serotonergic receptors. Evaluation of the lead compound 1 on cocaine-seeking behavior in non-human primates showed a substantial reduction in cocaine self-administration behavior and food intake. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we present a high-resolution, multidimensional, in vivo atlas of four of the human brain's 5-HT receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT4) and the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT). The atlas is created from molecular and structural high-resolution neuroimaging data consisting of positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans acquired in a total of 210 healthy individuals. Comparison of the regional PET binding measures with postmortem human brain autoradiography outcomes showed a high correlation for the five 5-HT targets and this enabled us to transform the atlas to represent protein densities (in picomoles per milliliter). We also assessed the regional association between protein concentration and mRNA expression in the human brain by comparing the 5-HT density across the atlas with data from the Allen Human Brain atlas and identified receptor-and transporter-specific associations that show the regional relation between the two measures. Together, these data provide unparalleled insight into the serotonin system of the human brain.

Sensitization to psychostimulants and resultant alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in rodents has been suggested as a useful model of schizophrenia. This study sought to examine the use of methylphenidate as a psychostimulant to induce dopamine release and that of [F-18]fallypride as a radioligand to quantify the release in a primate model of schizophrenia. Four common marmosets were scanned by positron emission tomography twice, before and after methylphenidate challenge, to evaluate dopamine release. Four other marmosets were sensitized by repeated methamphetamine (MAP) administration. Then, they were scanned twice, before and after methylphenidate challenge, to evaluate whether MAP-sensitization induced greater sensitivity to methylphenidate. We revealed a main effect of the methylphenidate challenge but not the MAP pretreatment on the striatal binding potential. These results suggest that methylphenidate-induced striatal dopamine release in the common marmoset could be evaluated by [F-18]fallypride.

This series is composed of fluoroalkyl- and fluoroalkynyl- analogues, prepared from a common iodinated intermediate via Sonogashira coupling reactions. All derivatives displayed subnanomolar affinity for the TSPO (0.37 to 0.86 nM), comparable to that of 2 (0.91 nM). Two of them were radiolabeled with fluorine-18, and their biodistribution was investigated by in vitro autoradiography and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging on a rodent model of neuroinflammation. Brain uptake and local accumulation of both compounds in the AMPA-mediated lesion confirm their potential as in vivo PET-radiotracers. In particular, [F-18]23 exhibited a significantly higher ipsi- to contralateral ratio at 60 min than the parent molecule [F-18]2 in vivo.

Molecular determinants of positive allosteric modulation of the human metabotropic glutamate receptor 2	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; MGLU2 RECEPTOR; BINDING POCKET; DISCOVERY; POTENT; AGONIST; IDENTIFICATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; COOPERATIVITY; SUBTYPE-2	Background and PurposeThe activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu(2)) reduces glutamatergic transmission in brain regions where excess excitatory signalling is implicated in disorders such as anxiety and schizophrenia. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) can provide a fine-tuned potentiation of these receptors' function and are being investigated as a novel therapeutic approach. An extensive set of mutant human mGlu(2) receptors were used to investigate the molecular determinants that are important for positive allosteric modulation at this receptor. Experimental ApproachSite-directed mutagenesis, binding and functional assays were employed to identify amino acids important for the activity of nine PAMs. The data from the radioligand binding and mutagenesis studies were used with computational docking to predict a binding mode at an mGlu(2) receptor model based on the recent structure of the mGlu(1) receptor. Key ResultsNew amino acids in TM3 (R635, L639, F643), TM5 (L732) and TM6 (W773, F776) were identified for the first time as playing an important role in the activity of mGlu(2) PAMs. Conclusions and ImplicationsThis extensive study furthers our understanding of positive allosteric modulation of the mGlu(2) receptor and can contribute to improved future design of mGlu(2) PAMs.	[Farinha, A.; Lavreysen, H.; Peeters, L.; Russo, B.; Tresadern, G.] Janssen Res & Dev, Div Janssen Pharmaceut, Neurosci Discovery, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium; [Masure, S.; Tresadern, G.] Janssen Res & Dev, Div Janssen Pharmaceut, Discovery Sci, B-2340 Beerse, Belgium; [Trabanco, A.

Tumor Diagnosis with New <SUP>111</SUP>In-Radioligands Based on Truncated Human Gastrin Releasing Peptide Sequences: Synthesis and Preclinical Comparison	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							RECEPTOR-TARGETED SCINTIGRAPHY; CELL LUNG-CARCINOMA; BOMBESIN ANALOGS; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; PROSTATE-CANCER; IN-111; RADIOTRACERS; PHARMACOLOGY; RADIOLIGAND; MECHANISMS	Radiolabeled analogs of the frog tetradecapeptide bombesin (BBN) have been proposed for diagnosis and therapy of gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-expressing tumors. Following a different and yet unexplored approach, we have developed four novel In-111-labeled truncated analogs of the human 27-mer GRP after conjugation of 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) at the N-terminus of GRP(13/14/17/18-27) fragments. Analog affinities for the human GRPR determined against [I-125-Tyr(4)]BBN were at the nanomolar level and dependent on truncation site. The respective In-111 radioligands specifically internalized in GRPR-expressing PC-3 cells. The shorter chain [In-111-DOTA]GRP(17/18-27) analogs showed higher stability in mice. Radioligands specifically localized in human PC-3 xenografts in SCID mice, with [In-111-DOTA]GRP(17-27) exhibiting the most favorable pharmacokinetic profile. This study has demonstrated the efficacy of human GRP-based radiopeptides to target GRPR-positive lesions in vivo and has revealed the impact of GRP chain length on key biological parameters of resulting radiotracers.

[F-18]24 and [F-18]32 displayed high affinity for A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-1 = 9.3 and 3.9 nM, respectively). In vitro autoradiography with sections of post-mortem AD brain and transgenic mouse brain confirmed the affinity of these tracers. Initial high uptake into and rapid washout from the brain in normal mice were observed. [F-18]24 also displayed excellent binding to A beta plaques in ex vivo autoradiographic experiments with Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, small-animal PET studies demonstrated significant differences in the clearance profile after the administration of [F-18]24 between Tg2576 and wild-type mice. The results suggest [F-18]24 to be a useful PET agent for detecting A beta plaques in the living human brain.

Structure and Dynamics of Monomer-Template Complexation: An Explanation for Molecularly Imprinted Polymer Recognition Site Heterogeneity	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							FREE-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; HISTOGRAM ANALYSIS METHOD; SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; MESH EWALD METHOD; COMPUTATIONAL APPROACH; RATIONAL DESIGN; SELF-ORGANIZATION; LIGAND-BINDING; SIMULATIONS; ACID	We here present the first simulation of a complete molecularly imprinted polymer prepolymerization system. Molecular dynamics studies were performed for a system comprising a total of 1199 discrete molecules, replicating the components and concentrations employed in the corresponding polymer synthesis. The observed interactions correlate well with results obtained from H-1 NMR spectroscopic studies. Comparison with simulations performed in the absence of cross-linking agent (ethylene dimethacrylate) demonstrated its significance in the formation of ligand recognition sites. Moreover, the influence of events such as template-template (bupivacaine) and monomer-monomer (methacrylic acid) self-association, porogen-template interactions, and template conformational variability was revealed. The template recognition capacity of the modeled polymer system was verified by synthesis of imprinted and reference polymers and subsequent radioligand binding Analysis. Collectively, through a series of statistical analyses of molecular trajectories in conjunction with spectroscopic data it was demonstrated that an ensemble of complex structures is present in the prepolymerization mixture and that this diversity is the basis for the binding site heterogeneity observed in molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) prepared using the noncovalent strategy.

Methods: An adenoviral vector (test), carrying hERL gene and a model angiogenesis therapeutic gene (human thymidine phosphorylase, hTP) was constructed along with a control vector. In vitro radioligand binding and expression studies were performed on various cell lines. The control and test viruses were injected into contralateral adductor muscles of a rat followed by FES-PET imaging and immunohistochemical staining of resected muscle samples. Results: A high FES uptake accompanied by hERL and hTP expression was obtained both in vitro and in vivo by the test adenovirus infection. Conclusion: Considering the versatile tissue permeability of the probe, highly efficient gene expression, and safeness for human use, we expect our reporter gene system to have favorable characteristics for clinical application.

Synthesis and evaluation in monkey of two sensitive <SUP>11</SUP>C-labeled aryloxyanilide ligands for imaging brain peripheral benzodiazepine receptors in vivo	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN 18 KDA; BINDING-SITES; PET; RADIOLIGANDS; RADIOSYNTHESIS; DERIVATIVES; MICROGLIA; TISSUE; VISUALIZATION; CARBOXAMIDE	We sought to develop C-11-labeled ligands for sensitive imaging of brain peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR) in vivo. Two aryloxyanilides with high affinity for PBR were identified and synthesized, namely, N-acetyl-N-(2-methoxycarbonylbenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline (3, PBR01) and N-(2-methoxybenzyI)-N-(4-phenoxypyridin-3-yl)acetamide (10, PBR28). 3 was hydrolyzed to 4, which was esterified with [C-11]iodomethane to provide [C-11]3. The O-desmethyl analogue of 10 was converted into [C-11]10 with [C-11]iodomethane. [C-11]3 and [C-11]10 were each injected into monkey to assess their brain kinetics with positron emission tomography (PET). After administration of either radioligand there was moderately high brain uptake of radioactivity. Receptor blocking and displacement experiments showed that a high proportion of this radioactivity was bound specifically to PBR. In monkey and rat, 3 and 10 were rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis and N-debenzylation, respectively, each to a single polar radiometabolite. [C-11]3 and [C-11]10 are effective for imaging PBR in monkey brain. [C-11]10 especially warrants further evaluation in human subjects.

Exposure (48 and/or 96 h) of human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells stably expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2s GABA(A) receptors for gamma-aminobutyric (GABA, 1 mM) and muscimol (100 muM), but not for diazepani (1 muM), enhanced the maximum number (B-max) of [H-3]flunitrazepam binding sites without affecting their affinity (K-d). The GABA-induced enhancement in B-max was reduced by the GABA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (100 muM), and by cycloheximide (10 mul/ml), a protein synthesis inhibitor. GABA (100 muM) enhanced the affinity of [H-3]flunitrazepam binding to vehicle- and GABA-pretreated, but not to diazepam-pretreated, HEK 293 cells. The results suggest that chronic GABA treatment up-regulates stably expressed GABA(A) receptors, presumably by stimulating their synthesis. Unlike chronic diazepam, which produced functional uncoupling of GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites, chronic GABA failed to produce this effect. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Vas deferens tissue was used 10, 30 and 90 days after the last injection, to verify if modifications are persistent. Binding studies with cell membranes, using [H-3]isradipine, showed an increase of the density (B-max) of Ca2+ channels by more than 60%, after 10 and 30 days, without changes of affinity (K-d). Maximal contractions (E-max) of KCl, were increased by 106% and 37%, respectively, after 10 and 30 days, without changes of apparent affinity (pD(2)). After 90 days, the values of B-max, K-d, E-max and pD(2) were not different from the controls. Differences were also not found for rats injected when adult. It is concluded that treatment of newborn, but not of adult, rats with nifedipine produced a long-lasting, though reversible, upregulation of L-type Ca2+ channels. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Optimization and tissue distribution of [<SUP>125</SUP>I]iododomperidone as a radiotracer for D<sub>2</sub>-receptor imaging	JOURNAL OF RADIOANALYTICAL AND NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Domperidone; Radioiodination; D-2-receptor Imaging; MOE and PreADMET	BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; MOLECULAR DOCKING; DOMPERIDONE; DOPAMINE; RADIOIODINATION	The aim of the present study is to use [I-125]iododomperidone (I-125-DOM) as a novel radioligand for dopamine D2-receptor (D2R) imaging. Therefore, a 12 h in vitro stable [I-125]iododomperidone was synthesized with a maximum radiochemical yield (RCY) of 95.5% in subsistence of chloramine-T (CAT) as an oxidant. Furthermore, molecular operating environment (MOE) design was employed to assess the determination of the [I-125]iododomperidone structure. The product structure was confirmed by employing cold iodination reaction using iodine-127. Moreover, the computational data which obtained from PreADMET software proved the increase of lipophilicity of [I-125]iododomperidone over that of unlabeled one. In a trial to confirm the targeting ability of [I-125]iododomperidone to D2R, docking study was performed and showed a successful binding of the labeled compound to the receptor. The biodistribution profile of [I-125]iododomperidone in normal mice showed a rapid and high uptake of the brain (5.6 +/- 0.2% ID/g organ) at 5 min post injection (p.i.). Consequently, [I-125]iododomperidone will be a potential unprecedented D2R imaging agent for diagnosis of various neuropsychiatric disorders.

A Selective Carborane-Functionalized Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Receptor Agonist as Boron Delivery Agent for Boron Neutron Capture Therapy	JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article							EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; HIGH-AFFINITY; BOMBESIN RECEPTORS; BREAST-CANCER; DERIVATIVES; CONJUGATION; EXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; PHARMACOLOGY; RADIOLIGAND	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) allows the selective elimination of malignant tumor cells without affecting healthy tissue. Although this binary radiotherapy approach has been known for decades, BNCT failed to reach the daily clinics to date. One of the reasons is the lack of selective boron delivery agents. Using boron loaded peptide conjugates, which address G protein-coupled receptors overexpressed on tumor cells allow the intracellular accumulation of boron. The gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) is a well-known target in cancer diagnosis and can potentially be used for BNCT. Here, we present the successful introduction of multiple bis-deoxygalactosyl-carborane building blocks to the GRPR-selective ligand [D-Phe(6), beta-Ala(11)) Ala(13), Nle(14)]Bn(6-14) (sBB2L) generating peptide conjugates with up to 80 boron atoms per molecule. Receptor activation was retained, metabolic stability was increased, and uptake into PC3 cells was proven without showing any intrinsic cytotoxicity. Furthermore, undesired uptake into liver cells was suppressed by using L-deoxygalactosyl modified carborane building blocks. Due to its high boron loading and excellent GRPR selectivity, this conjugate can be considered as a promising boron delivery agent for BNCT.

Objectives: Here we investigated whether microglial activation measured by [C-11]PK11195 PET is associated with neuronal function measured by cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRGlc) using FDG-PET and hippocampal volume measurements. Methods: We enrolled 25 subjects (9 PDD, 8 AD, and 8 controls) who underwent PET scans with [C-11](R)PK11195, [F-18]FDG, and volumetric MRI scanning. Results: SPMcorrelation analysis in AD and PDD showed a negative correlation between hippocampal volume and microglial activation within hippocampus or parahippocampus and with cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus, while there was a positive correlation between rCMRGlc in cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus and hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was significantly reduced in AD compared to controls but not in PDD. Conclusions: These findings indicate that microglial activation inversely correlated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal rCMRGlc in neurodegenerative diseases with dementia, providing further evidence for the central role of microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases.

Toward Noninvasive Quantification of Brain Radioligand Binding by Combining Electronic Health Records and Dynamic PET Imaging Data	IEEE JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL AND HEALTH INFORMATICS			English	Article						Arterial input function (AIF); electronic health record (EHR); positron emission tomography (PET) imaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL METABOLIC-RATE; IN-VIVO QUANTIFICATION; INPUT FUNCTION; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; PREDICTION; VOLUME	Quantitative analysis of positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging data requires a metabolite-corrected arterial input function (AIF) for estimation of distribution volume and related outcome measures. Collecting arterial blood samples adds risk, cost, measurement error, and patient discomfort to PET studies. Minimally invasive AIF estimation is possible with simultaneous estimation (SIME), but at least one arterial blood sample is necessary. In this study, we describe a noninvasive SIME (nSIME) approach that utilizes a pharmacokinetic input function model and constraints derived from machine learning applied to an electronic health record database consisting of "long tail" data (digital records, paper charts, and handwritten notes) that were collected ancillary to the PET studies. We evaluated the performance of nSIME on 95 [C-11]DASB PET scans that had measured AIFs. The results indicate that nSIME is a promising alternative to invasive AIF measurement. The general framework presented here may be expanded to other metabolized radioligands, potentially enabling quantitative analysis of PET studies without blood sampling.

Decline in prefrontal catecholamine synthesis explains age-related changes in cognitive speed beyond regional grey matter atrophy	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Ageing; Biological parametric mapping; Cognitive speed; Dopamine	DOPAMINE SYNTHESIS CAPACITY; PET	Age-related decline in cognitive speed has been associated with prefrontal dopamine D1 receptor availability, but the contribution of presynaptic dopamine and noradrenaline innervation to age-related changes in cognition is unknown. In a group of 16 healthy participants aged 22-61 years, we used PET and the radioligand FDOPA to measure catecholamine synthesis capacity (K (in) (app); millilitres per gram per minute) and the digit symbol substitution test to measure cognitive speed, a component of fluid IQ. Cognitive speed was associated with the magnitude of K (in) (app) in the prefrontal cortex (p < 0.0005). Both cognitive speed (p = 0.003) and FDOPA K (in) (app) (p < 0.0005) declined with age, both in a standard voxel-wise analysis and in a volume-of-interest analysis with partial volume correction, and the correlation between cognitive speed and K (in) (app) remained significant beyond the effects of age (p = 0.047). MR-based segmentation revealed that these age-related declines were not attributable to age-related alterations in grey matter density. Our findings indicate that age-related changes in the capacity of the prefrontal cortex to synthesize catecholamines, irrespective of cortical atrophy, may underlie age-related decline in cognitive speed.

Imaging FAAH in vivo using PET or SPECT is important to deeper understanding of its role in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, at present, no radioligand is available for mapping the enzyme in vivo. Here, we synthesized 18 aryl analogues of anandamide, FAAH's endogenous substrate, and in vitro evaluated their potential as metabolic trapping tracers. Interaction studies with recombinant FAAH revealed good to very good interaction of the methoxy substituted aryl anandamide analogues 17, 18, 19, and 20 with FAAH and they were identified as competing substrates, Compounds 17 and 18 did not display significant binding to CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors and stand out as potential candidate metabolic trapping tracers. They were successfully labeled with C-11 in good yields and high radiochemical purity and displayed brain uptake in C57BL/6J mice. Radioligands [C-11]-17 and [C-11]-18 merit further investigation in vivo.

Recently, three 9-ethyladenine derivatives bearing a bromine atom, an ethoxy group, and a furyl ring, respectively, in the 8-position have been reported to ameliorate motor deficits in rat Parkinson's disease models, suggesting a potential therapeutic role for these compounds. Starting from these observations, a new series of 9-ethyladenine derivatives, bearing different substituents such as halogens, alkoxy groups, aromatic and heteroaromatic rings in the 8-position, were synthesized. Radioligand binding assays demonstrated that some of the new compounds bind rat AA,,R with higher affinity than the previously reported congeners and that there is a good correlation between binding to rat and human receptors. Hence, the new molecules could represent new tools suitable for the in vivo studies in rat models of Parkinson's disease. Finally, a molecular docking analysis of the compounds was performed using a homology model of rat AA(2A)R, built using the human crystal structure as the template, and results are in agreement with the binding data.

These autoantibodies and their epitopes are, however, not well characterized. We explored the use of monoclonal antibodies and their recombinant Fab as reagents for epitope analysis. In this study we cloned and characterized the recombinant Fab of the insulin-specific monoclonal antibody CG7C7. We found the epitope of this antibody to be located predominantly at the A-chain loop of the insulin molecule. The recombinant Fab was then used to compete for insulin binding against insulin autoantibodies present in sera from patients with type 1 or type 1.5 diabetes. In competition experiments with sera positive for autoantibodies to insulin the recombinant Fab significantly reduced the binding to [I-125]-insulin by sera of type 1 (n = 35) and type 1.5 diabetes [latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA)] (n = 14) patients (P < 0.0001). We conclude that competition between insulin-specific monoclonal antibodies or their recombinant Fab and insulin autoantibodies should prove useful in the epitope analysis of autoantibodies to insulin.

Halothane, in the concentration range of 0.5-2 mM, caused a significant inhibition of Ca-45(2+) fluxes. Xenon tested in the range of 60%-100% did not affect the Ca-45(2+) fluxes. Radioligand binding studies indicated that xenon and halothane have different effects on the specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine to transverse tubule membranes. Halothane caused a significant inhibition on the specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine. In controls and in presence of 0.5 mM halothane, B-max values were 26.9 pmole/mg and 15.1 pmole/mg, and K-D values were 238 pM and 247 pM, respectively. On the other hand, there was no effect of xenon (60%-100%) on the characteristics of [H-3]Isradipine binding. In conclusion, results indicate that xenon and halothane differ in their effects on the function of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and on the specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine in skeletal muscle membranes.

J	Matveev, SV; Smart, EJ				Matveev, SV; Smart, EJ			Heterologous desensitization of EGF receptors and PDGF receptors by sequestration in caveolae	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						caveolae; signaling; desensitization	EPIDERMAL GROWTH-FACTOR; ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; GPI-ANCHORED PROTEINS; LOW-BUOYANT DENSITY; CHOLESTEROL DEPLETION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; CHAPERONE COMPLEX; MA104 CELLS; MEMBRANE; TRANSPORT	Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors have been reported to signal via caveolin-containing membranes called caveolae. In contrast, others report that EGF and PDGF receptors are exclusively associated with caveolin-devoid membranes called rafts. Our subcellular fractionation and coimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that, in the absence of ligand, EGF and PDGF receptors are associated with rafts. However, in the presence of ligand, EGF and PDGF receptors transiently associate with caveolae. Surprisingly, pretreatment of cells with EGF prevents PDGF-dependent phosphorylation of PDGF receptors and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 kinase activation. Furthermore, cells pretreated with PDGF prevent EGF-dependent phosphorylation of EGF receptors and ERK1/2 kinase activation. Radioligand binding studies demonstrate that incubation of cells with EGF or PDGF causes both EGF and PDGF receptors to be reversibly sequestered from the extracellular space. Experiments with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin, filipin, and antisense caveolin-1 demonstrate that sequestration of the receptors is dependent on cholesterol and caveolin-1. We conclude that ligand-induced stimulation of EGF or PDGF receptors can cause the heterologous desensitization of the other receptor by sequestration in cholesterol-rich, caveolin-containing membranes or caveolae.

Herein we present a novel F-18-labeled derivative of the drug irbesartan, one of the most prescribed angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) antagonists, for in vivo positron emission tomography (PET). This allows the in vivo measurement of AT(1)R expression, and thus the evaluation of functional changes in its expression under pathophysiological conditions. We followed various synthetic approaches optimized for the introduction of fluorine into different positions of the aliphatic side chain of irbesartan. Radioligand binding studies revealed that fluorine atoms at specified positions (alpha-position (IC50=6.6 nm) and delta-position (IC50=8.5 nm) of the aliphatic side chain) do not alter the binding properties of irbesartan (IC50=1.6 nm). After successful radiolabeling with fluorine-18 in a radiochemical yield of 11 %, we observed high renal uptake in healthy rats and pigs, which could be decreased by pretreatment with the parent compound irbesartan.

Specific structural modifications were performed in order to maintain affinity for the target receptor and to improve the selectivity over 5-HT1A and adrenergic alpha(1) receptors. The synthesized compounds have chemical features that could enable labeling with a positron emitter radioisotope (carbon-11 or fluorine-18) and lipophilicity within the range considered optimal for brain penetration and low non-specific binding. 4-[2-(4-Methoxyphenyl) phenyl]-N-(pyridin-4ylmethyl) piperazinehexanamide (23a) and N-pyridin-4-ylmethyl-3-[4-[2-(4-methoxyphenyl) phenyl] piperazin-1-yl]ethoxy]propanamide (26a) were radiolabeled on the methoxy group with carbon-11. Positron emission tomography (PET) analysis revealed that [C-11]-23a and [C-11]-26a were P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and rapidly metabolized, resulting in poor brain uptake. These features were not predicted by in vitro tests. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Effect of Chelators on the Pharmacokinetics of <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Labeled Imaging Agents for the Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA)	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							LINKED ACIDIC DIPEPTIDASE; SOLID-PHASE SYNTHESIS; GLUTAMATE CARBOXYPEPTIDASES; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; BIFUNCTIONAL CHELATOR; IN-VITRO; CANCER; TC-99M; EXPRESSION; INHIBITOR	Technetium-99m, the most commonly used radionuclide in nuclear medicine, can be attached to biologically important molecules through a variety of chelating agents, the choice of which depends upon the imaging application. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is increasingly recognized as an important target for imaging and therapy of prostate cancer (PCa). Three different Tc-99m-labeling methods were employed to investigate the effect of the chelator on the biodistribution and PCa tumor uptake profiles of 12 new urea-based PSMA-targeted radiotracers. This series includes hydrophilic ligands for radiolabeling with the [Tc-99m(CO)(3)](+) core (L8-L10), traditional NxSy-based chelating agents with varying charge and polarity for the Tc-99m-oxo core (L11-L18), and a Tc-99m-organohydrazine-labeled radioligand (L19). Tc-99m(I)-Tricarbonyl-labeled [Tc-99m]L8 produced the highest PSMA+ PC3 PIP to PSMA- PC3 flu tumor ratios and demonstrated the lowest retention in normal tissues including kidney after 2 h. These results suggest that choice of chelator is an important pharmacokinetic consideration in the development of Tc-99m-labeled radiopharmaceuticals targeting PSMA.

The compounds were synthesized either by microwave irradiation technique or by conventional synthesis and were characterized by spectral data (IR, H-1 NMR, and MS) and the purity was ascertained by microanalysis. The D-2 and 5-HT2A affinity of the synthesized compounds was screened in vitro by radioligand displacement assays on membrane homogenates isolated from rat striatum and rat cortex, respectively. Furthermore, all the synthesized compounds were screened for their in vivo pharmacological activity in Swiss albino mice. The D-2 antagonism studies were performed using climbing mouse assay model and 5-HT2A antagonism studies were performed using quipazine-induced head twitches in mice. It was observed that none of the new chemical entities exhibited catalepsy and 10f is the most active among the synthesized compounds with 5-HT2A/D-2 ratio of 1.1286 although the standard drug risperidone exhibited 5-HT2A/D-2 ratio of 1.0989.

It shares 11 of its 14 amino acids with somatostatin-14 (SRIF-14). In the present study, binding sites for cortistatin-14 in the mouse brain were examined and compared to those for somatostatin using iodinated cortistatin-14 and iodinated somatostatin-14. By in vitro receptor autoradiography, high densities of cortistatin-14 and somatostatin-14 specific binding sites were detected in the cortex, hippocampal formation, basolateral amygdala and medial habenula. Unlabeled 100 nM cortistatin-14 inhibited iodinated somatostatin-14 binding in the hippocampus, but not in the cortex or amygdaloid nuclei. In somatostatin receptor subtype-2 knock-out (KO) mice, autoradiographic iodinated somatostatin-14 binding was observed in the hippocampus and habenula but was removed in the cortex and amygdaloid nuclei, specific iodinated cortistatin- 14 binding sites were found in the hippocampus, habenula and throughout the cortex. We conclude that the somatostatin receptor subtype-2 is responsible for somatostatin binding in cortical and amygdaloid regions and that cortistatin predominantly interacts with the same receptors as somatostatin.

We also examined the effect of later introduction of cow milk proteins and gluten. Blood samples were taken from 205 children at 6 weeks, 6 months, 18 months, and 5 years, whose mothers had been randomized to either a cow-milk-free diet or not during the last trimester of pregnancy. During the first 3 months of life, cow milk proteins were not fed to the children. Autoantibodies against GAD(65) (GADA), tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A), and insulin (IAA) were determined by a radioligand-binding assay. We found specific autoantibodies, although in low concentrations below the traditional cutoff for positivity in the children. The diet of the mother during pregnancy had no influence on development of autoantibodies, nor did duration of breast-feeding or time for introduction of gluten. Cow milk introduction between 3 and 6 months caused a transient increase in GADA at 6 months of age (p < 0.05). Children who developed atopic disease had significantly lower IA-2A at 6 months (p < 0.001).

We have found that the selective anxiolytic gidazepam has a higher affinity for CNS MBRs as compared to central benzodiazepine receptors. The ability of gidazepam to bind to MBRs probably underlies a wide spectrum of its pharmacological effects. We have studied affinities of gidazepam analogs for CNS MBRs in search for the ligands possessing higher affinity and selectivity. The experiments were carried out with male Wistar rats weighing between 200-220 g. Affinities of the investigated compounds were assessed on their ability to displace radioligand Ro5-4864 from its specific binding sites on MBRs of rat brain. Within the series of tested compounds three substances comparable on affinity with Ro5-4864 were found. Experimental results have shown that the presence of chlorine atom in o-position of 5-phenyl substituent leads to a 10 to 15-fold increase in affinity for CNS MBRs. We have also found that the essential contribution in affinity of the investigated series is brought by lipophilicity of substituent in IN-position. Our data may be useful in design and synthesis of novel potent selectively acting ligands of CNS MBRs.

These peptides bind with high affinity and specificity to a novel binding site designated the angiotensin AT(4) receptor. Until now, the AT(4) receptor has eluded molecular characterization. Here we identify the AT(4) receptor, by protein purification and peptide sequencing, to be insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP). HEK 293T cells transfected with IRAP exhibit typical AT(4) receptor binding characteristics; the AT(4) receptor ligands, angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7, compete for the binding of [I-125]Nle(1)-angiotensin IV with IC50 values of 32 and 140 nM, respectively. The distribution of IRAP and its mRNA in the brain, determined by immunohistochemistry and hybridization histochemistry, parallels that of the AT(4) receptor determined by radioligand binding. We also show that AT(4) receptor ligands dose-dependently inhibit the catalytic activity of IRAP. We have therefore demonstrated that the AT(4) receptor is IRAP and propose that AT(4) receptor ligands may exert their effects by inhibiting the catalytic activity of IRAP thereby extending the half-life of its neuropeptide substrates.

Clinical studies on a few PSMA radiotracers are currently underway to determine their efficacy as imaging agents to detect prostate cancer. To improve tumor retention and tumor-to-normal tissue contrast, we herein report the synthesis and preclinical evaluation of an (AlF)-F-18-labeled bivalent PSMA ligand (F-18-Bi-PSMA). F-18-Bi-PSMA was successful automated preparation and in vitro evaluation showed that F-18-Bi-PSMA was potent binding affinity, high specificity, and rapid internalization in PSMA-expressing cells. Biodistribution studies revealed a high and specific tumor uptake of 20.5 +/- 3.5 %ID/g in 22Rv1 tumor-bearing mice. Furthermore, compared to the clinically used monomeric PSMA-targeting tracers, Ga-68-PSMA-11 and F-18-PSMA-1007, F-18-Bi-PSMA exhibited improved pharmacokinetics and higher tumor uptake, as well as better tumor-to-normal tissue contrast, resulting in considerably high imaging quality. Our findings indicated that the bivalent PSMA radioligand, F-18-Bi-PSMA, was successfully synthesized and ideal imaging properties. (C) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Pyrrole-2 carboxamides-A novel class of insect ryanodine receptor activators	PESTICIDE BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Insecticide mode of action; Ryanodine receptor; RyR; Diamide insecticides	DIAMIDE INSECTICIDES; ANTHRANILIC DIAMIDE; DIAMONDBACK MOTH; BINDING-SITES; RESISTANCE; CHLORANTRANILIPROLE; MUTATIONS; SKELETAL; DISCOVERY; CHANNELS	The ryanodine receptor (RyR) is an intracellular calcium channel critical to the regulation of insect muscle contraction and the target site of diamide insecticides such as chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole and flubendiamide. To-date, diamides are the only known class of synthetic molecules with high potency against insect RyRs. Target-based screening of an informer library led to discovery of a novel class of RyR activators, pyrrole-2carboxamides. Efforts to optimize receptor activity resulted in analogs with potency comparable to that of commercial diamides when tested against RyR of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Surprisingly, testing of pyrrole-2-carboxamides in whole-insect screens showed poor insecticidal activity, which is partially attributed to differential selectivity among insect receptors and rapid detoxification. Among various lepidopteran species field resistance to diamide insecticides has been well documented and in many cases has been attributed to a single point mutation, G4946E, of the RyR gene. As with diamide insecticides, the G4946E mutation confers greatly reduced sensitivity to pyrrole-2-carboxamides. This, coupled with findings from radioligand binding studies, indicates a shared binding domain between anthranilic diamides and pyrrole-2-carboxamides.

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K-i(mu) = 0.5 +/- 0.2 nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands. Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.

The aim of this work was to determine the binding of seven drugs to 2-adrenoceptors by frontal analysis using immobilized receptor stationary phase. The dissociation constants (Kd) were determined to be (3.16 +/- 0.09)x104M for salbutamol, (4.29 +/- 0.12)x104M for terbutaline, (6.19 +/- 0.16)x104M for methoxyphenamine, (2.11 +/- 0.07)x104M for tulobuterol, (1.82 +/- 0.11)x104M for fenoterol, (9.75 +/- 0.24)x106M formoterol, and (9.84 +/- 0.26)x105M for clenbuterol. These results showed a good correlation with the data determined by radioligand binding assay. Further investigations revealed that the dissociation constant mainly attributed to the number of hydrogen bonds in the structures of ligands. This study indicates that affinity chromatography using immobilized receptor stationary phase can be used for the direct determination of drug-receptor binding interactions and has the potential to become a reliable alternative for quantitative studies of ligandreceptor interactions.

Mahbubul			Evaluation of Neuroinflammation in X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy	PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGY			English	Article							BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS	We present findings of C-11-[R]-PK11195 positron emission tomography in a child with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy. C-11-[R]-PK11195 is a radioligand with a high and specific affinity for peripheral benzodiazepine receptors, expressed by activated microglia in cases of neuroinflammation, and therefore it is applicable to the in vivo detection of neuroinflammation with positron emission tomography. C-11-[R]-PK11195 positron emission tomography demonstrated increased tracer binding in the occipital, parietal, and posterior temporal white matter, in the genu of the corpus callosum, the bilateral posterior thalami, most of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, the bilateral cerebral peduncles, and the brainstem, indicating underlying neuroinflammation. The rest of the brain, including the cerebral cortices and cerebellum, exhibited minimal C-11-[R]-PK11195 binding. Our findings indicate significant neuroinflammation associated with white matter destruction in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which can be visualized in vivo with an C-11-[R]-PK11195 positron emission tomography scan. C-11-[R]-PK11195 positron emission tomography may also help evaluate the inflammatory burden and follow-up of the disease evolution. This technique may be particularly useful for evaluating treatment response, which is not easy with other imaging modalities, after white matter is significantly and extensively damaged.

Previous studies have shown lower dopamine transporter levels on late-onset Cloninger type I alcoholics. However, whether this lower level is due to a lower level of dopamine transporter protein or a lower level of dopaminergic nerve terminals remains unclear. The aim of this study was to compare putative alterations of dopaminergic terminals in caudate, putamen and nucleus accumbens of type I and type 2 alcoholics and healthy controls by using [3 H]dihydrotetrabenazine as a radioligand in postmortem human whole hemisphere autoradiography. We compared the present results with the findings of our earlier studies on the dopamine transporter in these same subjects, demonstrating that alcoholics do not differ significantly from controls in striatal [3 H]dihydrotetrabenazine binding. Although type I alcoholics have been reported to have up to 36% lower striatal dopamine transporter levels than controls, the results suggest that the density of their dopaminergic nerve terminals is not altered.

However, the selectivity in mouse was greatly reduced due to an increased tolerance of this ring system at the mouse A(1)AR. Therefore, we varied substituents at the N-6 and C2 positions in search of compounds that have improved A(3)AR selectivity and are species independent. An N-6-methyl analogue was balanced in affinity at mouse A(1)/A(3)ARs, with high selectivity in comparison to the A(2A)AR. Substitution of the 2-chloro atom with larger and more hydrophobic substituents, such as iodo and alkynyl groups, tended to increase the A(3)AR selectivity (up to 430-fold) in mouse and preserve it in human.

Low sensitivity of the positron emission tomography ligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C] diprenorphine to agonist opiates	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							DELTA-OPIOID RECEPTORS; DARK AGOUTI RAT; IN-VIVO; ENDOGENOUS OPIOIDS; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; BINDING-SITES; BRAIN; MU; INVIVO; OCCUPANCY	Previously, we reported minimal opioid receptor occupancy following a clinical dose of the mu-opioid agonist, methadone, measured in vivo using positron emission tomography ( PET) with [C-11] diprenorphine and subsequently used rats to obtain experimental data in support of a high receptor reserve hypothesis (Melichar et al., 2005). Here, we report on further preclinical studies investigating opioid receptor occupancy with oxycodone (mu- and kappa-receptor agonist), morphine (mu-receptor agonist), and buprenorphine (partial agonist at the mu-receptor and antagonist at the mu- and kappa-receptors), each given at antinociceptive doses. In vivo binding of [ 11C] diprenorphine was not significantly reduced after treatment with the full agonists but was reduced by similar to 90% by buprenorphine. In addition, given that [ 11C] diprenorphine is a non-subtype-specific PET tracer, there was no regional variation that might feasibly be interpreted as due to differences in opioid subtype distribution. The data support minimal competition between the high-efficacy agonists and the non-subtype-selective antagonist radioligand and highlight the limitations of [C-11] diprenorphine PET to monitor in vivo occupancy. Alternative means may be needed to address clinical issues regarding opioid receptor occupancy that are required to optimize treatment strategies.

In the first large-scale comparative study of GPCR protein production using recombinant baculovirus, we report the characterization of 16 human receptors. The GPCRs were produced in three insect cell lines and functional protein levels monitored over 72 h using radioligand binding assays. Different GPCRs exhibited widely different expression levels, ranging from less than 1 pmol receptor/mg protein to more than 250pmol/mg. No single set of conditions was suitable for all GPCRs, and large differences were seen for the expression of individual GPCRs in different cell lines. Closely related GPCRs did not share similar expression profiles; however, high expression (greater than 20 pmol/mg) was achieved for over half the GPCRs in our study. Overall, the levels of protein production compared favourably to other published systems. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Among the 12 mutants generated, mutation at Asn133 (N133W) gave increased basal signalling through three separate pathways. N133W increased the basal activity of G(14)- and G(16)-dependent pathways by two- to three-fold. The constitutive activity of the mutant was confirmed by the finding that the enhanced activity is dependent on the level of receptor expression. In HEK-293 cells stably expressing N133W, signalling through G(i/o) -dependent pathways was also observed. Radioligand binding studies revealed that the affinity for nociceptin of the wild-type ORL1 receptor and the N133W mutant do not differ significantly, suggesting that the ligand binding and signalling functions of constitutively active mutants of G protein-coupled receptors are not necessarily intrinsically linked. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that a mutation in the third transmembrane domain is able to increase the basal signalling activity of the human ORL1 receptor.

Kynurenine containing peptides endowed with opioid receptor activity have been isolated from natural organisms; thus, in this work, novel opioid peptide analogs incorporating L-kynurenine (L-kyn) and kynurenic acid (kyna) in place of native amino acids have been designed and synthesized with the aim to investigate the biological effect of these modifications. The kyna-containing peptide (KA1) binds selectively the mu-opioid receptor with a Ki = 1.08 +/- 0.26 (selectivity ratio mu/delta/kappa = 1:514:10,000), while the L-kyn-containing peptide (K6) shows a mixed binding affinity for mu, delta, and kappa-opioid receptors, with efficacy and potency (E-max = 209.7 + 3.4%; LogEC(50) = -5.984 + 0.054) higher than those of the reference compound DAMGO. This novel oligopeptide exhibits a strong antinociceptive effect after i.c.v. and s.c. administrations in in vivo tests, according to good stability in human plasma (t(1/2) = 47 min).

For meaningful results, all protein classes have to be tractable, including Gprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are hardly tractable by affinity pulldown from lysates. We report a capture compound (CC)-based strategy to target and identify GPCRs directly from living cells. We synthesized CCs with sertindole attached to the CC scaffold in different orientations to target the dopamineD2 receptor (DRD2) heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. The structure-activity relationship of sertindole for DRD2 binding was reflected in the activities of the sertindole CCs in radioligand displacement, cell-based assays, and capture compound mass spectrometry (CCMS). The activity pattern was rationalized by molecular modelling. The most-active CC showed activities very similar to that of unmodified sertindole. A concentration of DRD2 in living cells well below 100fmol used as an experimental input was sufficient for unambiguous identification of captured DRD2 by mass spectrometry. Our new CCMS workflow broadens the arsenal of chemoproteomic technologies to close a critical gap for the comprehensive characterization of drug-protein interactions.

Two derivatives (5d and 5k) displayed significant binding abilities in fluorescent staining experiments using the brain sections of AD patients. Two derivatives showed high binding affinities to beta-amyloid aggregates (5j, K-i = 5.82 +/- 0.19 nM) and brain homogenates of AD patients (5j, k(i)= 18.96 +/- 0.28 nM) in in vitro binding assay. With a log P value of 3.45, [I-125]5k exhibited an excellent initial brain uptake (5.29%ID g(-1), 2 min after i.v.) and a fast clearance from the brain in biodistribution experiments in normal mice. In autoradiography, [125I]5k exhibited an obvious binding ability to beta-amyloid plaques and a relatively low nonspecific binding in the brain sections of AD patients (in vitro) and APP/PS1 transgenic mice (in vitro and ex vivo). Results suggest that 5k is a potential probe for detecting beta-amyloid plaques in vivo. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Twenty of the 22 new analogues had high potency and selectivity for PDE10A: 18a-j, 19d-j, 20a-b, and 21b had IC50 values <5 nM for PDE10A. Seven F-18 labeled compounds [F-18](18)a-e, [F-18]18g, and [F-18]20a were radiosynthesized by F-18-introduction onto the quinoline rather than the pyrazole moiety of the MP-10 pharmacophore and performed in vivo evaluation. Biodistribution studies in rats showed similar to 2-fold higher activity in the PDE10A-enriched striatum than nontarget brain regions; this ratio increased from 5 to 30 min postinjection, particularly for [F-18]18a-d and [F-18]20a. Micro-PET studies of [F-18]18d and [F-18]20a in nonhuman primates provided clear visualization of striatum with suitable equilibrium kinetics and favorable metabolic stability. These results suggest this strategy may identify a F-18-labeled PET tracer for quantifying the levels of PDE10A in patients with CNS disorders including Huntington's disease and schizophrenia.

Evaluation of <i>N</i>-phenyl homopiperazine analogs as potential dopamine D<sub>3</sub> receptor selective ligands	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Dopamine D-2-like receptors; D-3 dopamine receptors; Receptor subtype selective ligands; Homopiperazine analogs	D3 RECEPTOR; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PARTIAL AGONISTS; THERAPEUTIC AGENTS; HIGH-AFFINITY; ANTAGONISTS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PRAMIPEXOLE; DISCOVERY; STRIATUM	A series of N-(2-methoxyphenyl) homopiperazine analogs was prepared and their affinities for dopamine D-2, D-3, and D-4 receptors were measured using competitive radioligand binding assays. Several ligands exhibited high binding affinity and selectivity for the D-3 dopamine receptor compared to the D-2 receptor subtype. Compounds 11a, 11b, 11c, 11f, 11j and 11k had Ki values ranging from 0.7 to 3.9 nM for the D-3 receptor with 30- to 170-fold selectivity for the D-3 versus D-2 receptor. Calculated log P values (logP = 2.6-3.6) are within the desired range for passive transport across the blood-brain barrier. When the binding and the intrinsic efficacy of these phenylhomopiperazines was compared to those of previously published phenylpiperazine analogues, it was found that (a) affinity at D-2 and D-3 dopamine receptors generally decreased, (b) the D-3 receptor binding selectivity (D-2:D-3 K-i value ratio) decreased and, (c) the intrinsic efficacy, measured using a forskolin-dependent adenylyl cyclase inhibition assay, generally increased.

Oxysterols direct immune cell migration via EBI2	NATURE			English	Article							DENDRITIC CELLS; CHOLESTEROL; EXPRESSION; MACROPHAGES; ENZYMES	Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 2 (EBI2, also known as GPR183) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is required for humoral immune responses; polymorphisms in the receptor have been associated with inflammatory autoimmune diseases(1-3). The natural ligand for EBI2 has been unknown. Here we describe the identification of 7 alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol (also called 7 alpha,25-OHC or 5-cholesten-3 beta,7 alpha,25-triol) as a potent and selective agonist of EBI2. Functional activation of human EBI2 by 7 alpha,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols was verified by monitoring second messenger readouts and saturable, high-affinity radioligand binding. Furthermore, we find that 7 alpha,25-OHC and closely related oxysterols act as chemoattractants for immune cells expressing EBI2 by directing cell migration in vitro and in vivo. A critical enzyme required for the generation of 7 alpha,25-OHC is cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H)(4). Similar to EBI2 receptor knockout mice, mice deficient in CH25H fail to position activated B cells within the spleen to the outer follicle and mount a reduced plasma cell response after an immune challenge. This demonstrates that CH25H generates EBI2 biological activity in vivo and indicates that the EBI2-oxysterol signalling pathway has an important role in the adaptive immune response.

Radioligand binding studies identified five compounds, 18a, 20a, 20c, 20e, and 21e, which bind with high affinity at D-3 (K-i = 0.17-5 nM) and moderate to high selectivity for D-3 VS D-2 receptors (ranging from similar to 25-to 163-fold). These compounds were also evaluated for intrinsic activity at D-2 and D3 receptors using a forskolin-dependent adenylyl cyclase assay. This panel of compounds exhibits varying receptor subtype binding selectivity and intrinsic activity at D-2 VS D-3 receptors. These compounds may be useful for behavioral pharmacology studies on the role of D-2-like dopamine receptors in neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. Furthermore, compound 20e, which has the highest binding affinity and selectivity for the D-3 receptor (K-i = 0.17 nM for D-3, 163-fold selectivity for D-3 VS D-2 receptors), represents a candidate fluorine-18 radiotracer for in vivo PET imaging studies on the regulation of D-3 receptor expression.

For instance, glucocorticoids are considered the most effective anti-inflammatory therapies for chronic inflammatory and immune diseases, such as asthma. But they are relatively ineffective in asthmatic smokers, and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis (CF). As such, the pharmaceutical industry is exploring new therapeutic approaches to address all major respiratory diseases. The previous chapters demonstrated the widespread influence of purinergic signaling on all pulmonary functions and defense mechanisms. In Chap. 8, we described animal studies which highlighted the critical role of aberrant purinergic activities in the development and maintenance of chronic airway diseases. This last chapter covers all clinical and pharmaceutical applications currently developed based on purinergic receptor agonists and antagonists. We use the information acquired in the previous chapters on purinergic signaling and lung functions to scrutinize the preclinical and clinical data, and to realign the efforts of the pharmaceutical industry.

We surveyed toxin concentrations in various tissues of Hooded Pitohui (Pitohui dichrous) using radioligand binding assays. The highest concentrations were found in the skin and feathers, on the outside of the birds, where predators or parasites are likely to encounter toxins. Significant levels of toxins also were found in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver. Muscle and liver would normally be poisoned by batrachotoxins; thus, Hooded Pitohuis must be insensitive to the toxins. The presence of toxins in internal organs further argues against the hypothesis that Hooded Pitohuis merely apply toxins topically to skin and feathers. Finally, we used scanning and transmission electron microscopy to examine skin and feathers for unusual morphological or histological adaptations for storing and secreting toxins. The skin of Hooded Pitohuis appears to have typical dermal and epidermal morphology, and we speculate on possible ways in which this species may sequester and secrete toxins using typical avian skin structural features, unique among vertebrates.

Although each technique has its merits, a direct link between drug efficacy and site of action in vivo usually cannot be established. In addition, when the specific mode of action of a drug has been determined from preclinical studies, it is often not known whether the administered dose is optimal for humans. Both industry and academia are becoming more and more interested in determining the dose-related occupancy of specific targets caused by administration of drugs under test. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are noninvasive imaging techniques that can give insight into the relationship between target occupancy and drug efficacy, provided a suitable radioligand is available. Although SPECT has certain advantages (e.g., a long half-life of the radionuclides), the spatial and temporal resolution as well as the labeling possibilities of this technique are limited. This review focuses on PET methodology for conducting drug occupancy studies in humans. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

Identification of a Potent Human Trace Amine-Associated Receptor1 Antagonist	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						trace amine-associated receptor 1 antagonist; cAMP functional assay; structure-activity relationship; Parkinson's disease; dopaminergic neurons; spontaneous firing rate	IN-VITRO MODELS; SELECTIVE ANTAGONISTS; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; DISCOVERY; TAAR1; DESIGN; AGONISTS; TETRAHYDROISOQUINOLINES; NEUROTRANSMISSION; PERMEABILITY	Human trace amine-associated receptor subtype 1 (hTAAR1) is a G protein-coupled receptor that has therapeutic potential for multiple diseases, including schizophrenia, drug addiction, and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although several potent agonists have been identified and have shown positive results in various clinical trials for schizophrenia, the discovery of potenthTAAR1 antagonists remains elusive. Herein, we report the results of structure-activity relationship studies that have led to the discovery of a potent hTAAR1 antagonist (RTI-7470-44,34). RTI-7470-44 exhibited an IC50of 8.4 nM in anin vitrocAMP functional assay, aKiof 0.3 nMin a radioligand binding assay, and showed species selectivity for hTAAR1 over the rat and mouseorthologues. RTI-7470-44 displayed good blood-brain barrier permeability, moderate metabolicstability, and a favorable preliminary off-target profile. Finally, RTI-7470-44 increased the spontaneousfiring rate of mouse VTA dopaminergic neurons and blocked the effects of the known TAAR1 agonist RO5166017.Collectively, this work provides a promising hTAAR1 antagonist probe that can be used to study TAAR1 pharmacology and the potential therapeutic role in hypodopaminergic diseases such as PD	[Decker, Ann M.; Brackeen, Marcus F.; Kormos, Chad M.; Hesk, David; Blough, Bruce E.] RTI Int, Ctr Drug Discovery, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA; [Mohammadkhani, Aida; Borgland, Stephanie L.] Univ Calgary, Dept Physiol & Pharmacol, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada	Research Triangle Institute; University of Calgary	Decker, AM (corresponding author), RTI Int, Ctr Drug Discovery, Res Triangle Pk, NC 27709 USA.	adecker@rti.org	Borgland, Stephanie/GPC-5260-2022	Borgland, Stephanie/0000-0001-7546-5687; Kormos, Chad/0000-0002-9394-2317; Hesk, David/0000-0003-4059-4168	National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health [R03NS116577]; RTI International research and development funds; Canada Research Chair Tier 1 grant [950-232211]; Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant [FDN-147473]; National Institute of Mental Health's Psychoactive Drug Screening Program [HHSN-271-2018-00023-C]	National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Neurological Disorders & Stroke (NINDS)); RTI International research and development funds; Canada Research Chair Tier 1 grant; Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); National Institute of Mental Health's Psychoactive Drug Screening Program(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH))	The chemistry, in vitro pharmacology, and ADME research was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health under award number R03NS116577 (awarded to A.M.D.).

Despite its extensive application, the utility of this tracer is currently hampered by the short half-life of the radionuclide used for its labeling (C-11, t(1/2) = 20.4 min). We herein report the design, synthesis, radiolabeling, and initial in vivo evaluation of a fluorine-18 (F-18, t(1/2) = 109.7 min) labeled analogue that is fluorinated in the 6-position of the aromatic ring ([F-18]6-F-AMTr). In a head-to-head comparison between [F-18]6-F-AMTr and [C-11]AMT in mice using PET, peak brain radioactivity, regional brain distribution, and kinetic profiles were similar between the two tracers. [F-18]6-F-AMTr was however not a substrate for IDOL or TPH as determined in in vitro enzymatic assays. The brain uptake of the tracer is thus more likely related to LAT1 transport over the blood-brain barrier than metabolism along the serotonin or kynurenine pathways.

Here, we investigated whether heart-specific T cells exert salutary or detrimental effects in the context of myocardial infarction (MI), the leading cause of death worldwide. After screening more than 150 class II-restricted epitopes, we found that myosin heavy chain alpha (MYHCA) was a dominant cardiac antigen triggering post-MI CD4(+)T cell activation in Balb/c mice. Transferred MYHCA(614-629)-specific CD4(+)T cells (TCR-M cells) selectively accumulated in the myocardium and mediastinal lymph nodes (med-LNs) of infarcted mice, acquired a Treg phenotype with a distinct prohealing gene expression profile, and mediated cardioprotection. Myocardial Tregs were also detected in autopsy samples from patients who had had a MI. Noninvasive PET/CT imaging using a CXCR4 radioligand revealed enlarged med-LNs with increased cellularity in patients with MI. Notably, the med-LN alterations observed in MI patients correlated with the infarct size and cardiac function. Taken together, the results obtained in our study provide evidence that MI context induces prohealing T cell autoimmunity in mice and confirm the existence of an analogous heart/med-LN/T cell axis in patients with MI.

Previously, we showed that a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM2) promotes anti-inflammatory phenotype of monocytes in vitro. In this study, we demonstrate the potential of SERM2 in amelioration of colitis. We utilized a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis model in FVB/n mice to demonstrate the effects of orally administered SERM2 on the clinical status of the mice and the histopathological changes in the colon, as well as proportion of Mrc-1 positive macrophages. SERM2 nuclear receptor affinities were measured by radioligand binding assays. Orally administered, this compound significantly alleviated DSS-induced colitis in male mice and induced local estrogen receptor activation in the inflamed colon, as well as promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine expression and infiltration of anti-inflammatory monocytes. We show that this novel drug candidate has an affinity to estrogen receptors alpha and beta and progesterone receptors, but not to glucocorticoid receptor, thus expressing unique binding properties compared to other sex steroid receptor ligands. These results indicate that novel drug candidates to alleviate inflammatory conditions of the colon could be found among sex steroid receptor activating compounds.

Since structural data for l(2)-IR remains unknown, the discovery of selective l(2)-IR ligands devoid of alpha(2)-drenoceptor (alpha(2)-AR) affinity is likely to provide valuable tools in defining the pharmacological characterization of these receptors. We report the pharmacological characterization of a new family of (2-imidazolin-4-yl)phosphonates. Radioligand binding studies showed that they displayed a higher affinity for I-2-IRs than idazoxan, and high l(2)/alpha(2) selectivity. In vivo studies in mice showed that acute treatments with lb and 2c significantly increased p-FADD/FADD ratio (an index of cell survival) in the hippocampus when compared with vehicle treated controls. Additionally, acute and repeated treatments with 2c, but not with lb, markedly reduced hippocampal p35 cleavage into neurotoxic p25. The present results indicate a neuroprotective potential of (2-imidazolin-4-yl)phosphonates acting at l(2)-IRs.

Interictal Type 1 Cannabinoid Receptor Binding is Increased in Female Migraine Patients	HEADACHE			English	Article						positron emission tomography imaging; migraine; endocannabinoid system	CORTEX; SYSTEM; PAIN	Objective. To compare binding of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) between migraine patients and healthy volunteers Background.-It has been suggested that endocannabinoid deficiency may play a role in the pathophysiology of migraine. Nonetheless, biochemical studies substantiating this idea remain scarce and are faced with methodological shortcomings partly because of the difficulty to perform measurements of endocannabinoids within the central nervous system itself. Methods.-An observational cross-sectional study was conducted in 20 female migraine patients and 18 healthy women matched for age and body mass index. Positron emission tomography acquisition was performed 90 minutes after intravenous injection of the radioligand [F-18] MK-9470 to assess binding of [F-18] MK-9470 to CB1R. Results.-Binding of CB1 R was globally increased in migraine patients vs healthy controls ( average gray matter difference +16%; P = .009, 2-sample 2-sided Student's t-test). There were no correlations between CB1R binding and any predefined migraine characteristics. Increases in CB1R binding were most pronounced in the anterior cingulate, mesial temporal, prefrontal, and superior frontal cortices. Conclusion.-The increased interictal CB1R binding, especially in brain regions that exert top-down influences to modulate pain, supports the idea that endocannibinoid deficiency is present in female patients suffering from episodic migraine.

Based on computer modeling and the X-ray structure of the A. californica AChBP complex with the PnIA[A10L, D14K] analog [1], single and multiple amino acid substitutions were introduced in alpha-conotoxin PnIA aimed at compounds of higher affinity and selectivity. Three analogs, PnIA[L5H], PnIA[A10L, D14K] and PnIA[L5R, A10L, D14R], have high affinities for AChBPs or alpha 7 nAChR, as found in competition with radioiodinated alpha-bungarotoxin. That is why we prepared radioiodinated derivatives of these alpha-conotoxins, demonstrated their specific binding and found that among the tested synthetic analogs, most had almost 10-fold higher affinity in competition with radioactive alpha-conotoxins as compared to competition with radioactive alpha-bungarotoxin. Thus, radioiodinated alpha-conotoxins are a more sensitive tool for checking the activity of novel alpha-conotoxins and other compounds quickly dissociating from the receptor complexes.

Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) Dendrimer Conjugates of "Clickable" Agonists of the A<sub>3</sub> Adenosine Receptor and Coactivation of the P2Y<sub>14</sub> Receptor by a Tethered Nucleotide	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ANTAGONIST; RADIOLIGAND; CHEMISTRY; LIGANDS	We previously synthesized a series of potent and selective A(3) adenosine receptor (AR) agonists (North-methanocarbanucleoside 5'-uronamides) containing dialkyne groups on extended adenine C2 substituents. We coupled the distal alkyne of a 2-octadiynyl nucleoside by Cu(I)-catalyzed "click" chemistry to azide-derivatized G4 (fourth-generation) PAMAM dendrimers to form triazoles. A(3)AR activation was preserved in these multivalent conjugates, which bound with apparent K-i of 0.1-0.3 nM. They were substituted with nucleoside moieties, solely or in combination with water-solubilizing carboxylic acid groups derived from hexynoic acid. A comparison with various amide-linked dendrimers showed that triazole-linked conjugates displayed selectivity and enhanced A(3)AR affinity. We prepared a PAMAM dendrimer containing equiproportioned peripheral azido and amino groups for conjugation of multiple ligands. A bifunctional conjugate activated both A(3) and P2Y(14) receptors (via amide-linked uridine-5'-diphosphoglucuronic acid), with selectivity in comparison to other ARs and P2Y receptors. This is the first example of targeting two different GPCRs with the same dendrimer conjugate, which is intended for activation of heteromeric GPCR aggregates. Synergistic effects of activating multiple GPCRs with a single dendrimer conjugate might be useful in disease treatment.

This allows inferences to be made about the signal estimates and resulting conclusions to he drawn about the underlying data. It can often be advantageous to interrogate temporal models after spatial transformation of the data into the wavelet domain. Wavelet bases provide a multiresolution decomposition of the spatial data dimension and an ensuing reduction in spatial correlation. However, widespread acceptance of these wavelet techniques has been hampered by the limited ability to reconstruct both parametric and error estimates into the image domain after analysis of temporal models in the wavelet domain. This paper introduces a derivation and a fast implementation of a method for the calculation of the variance of the parametric images obtained from wavelet filters. The technique is proposed for a class of estimators that have been shown to be useful in neuroimaging studies. The techniques are demonstrated for both functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) data sets. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Wistar male rats were divided into four groups; control group (CON, 10 rats), no physical or psychological stress; and one-, three-, and five-day stress groups of 12 rats each (1-DAY, 3-DAY, and 5-DAY, respectively), receiving psychological stress for the given number of days. Psychological stress were given to rats with a communication box. The standardized uptake value (SUV) of I-125-iomazenil of the 3-DAY and 5-DAY showed that I-125-iomazenil - benzodiazepine receptor binding was significantly reduced in the cortices, accumbens nuclei, amygdala and caudate putamen (p<0.05). Serum corticosterone level ratio appeared to be slightly elevated in 3-DAY and 5-DAY, although this elevation was not significant. These data suggest that I-125-IMZ is a useful radioligand to reflect received stress and its binding in the cortices, accumbens nuclei, amygdala and caudate putamen is strongly affected by psychological stress.

J	Harris, HA; Bapat, AR; Gonder, DS; Frail, DE				Harris, HA; Bapat, AR; Gonder, DS; Frail, DE			The ligand binding profiles of estrogen receptors α and β are species dependent	STEROIDS			English	Article						steroid; estrogen receptor; binding; phytoestrogen; antiestrogen	FUNCTIONAL-ANALYSIS; ER-BETA; CLONING; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; PHENOTYPES; WOMEN; CDNA; MICE	Estrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators are used for the treatment and prevention of conditions resulting from menopause. Since estrogens exert their activity by binding to nuclear receptors, there is intense interest in developing new ligands for the two known estrogen receptor subtypes, ER-alpha and ER-beta. Characterization assays used to profile new estrogen receptor ligands often utilize receptors from different species, with the assumption that they behave identically. To test this belief, we have profiled a number of estrogens, other steroids, phytoestrogens and selective estrogen receptor modulators in a solid phase radioligand binding assay using recombinant protein for human, rat, and mouse ER-alpha and ER-beta. Certain compounds show species dependent binding preferences for ER-a or ER-P, leading to differences in receptor subtype selectivity. The amino acids identified by crystallography as lining the ligand binding cavity are the same among the three species, suggesting that as yet unidentified amino acids contribute to the structure of the binding site. We conclude from this analysis that the ability of a compound to selectively bind to a particular ER subtype can be species dependent. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Kenakin, T				Kenakin, Terry			G-Protein/Receptor inhibitors as blockers of receptor signaling	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Receptor antagonism; G-Protein receptor coupling; Allosteric antagonism	MECHANISMS; ANTAGONISTS; AFFINITY; AGONISM	This paper describes the behavior of binding and functional receptor systems where an antagonist of the receptor/G protein binding reaction is added as a blocker of agonist-induced receptor function. For agonist radioligands, the reduction of G protein receptor interaction leads to a possible change in the binding affinity of the agonist radioligand to the receptor. Reciprocally, the allosteric cooperativity between the agonist and the G protein binding site antagonist (quantified by the factor gamma(B)) affects the potency of the G protein antagonist modulator; this model presents the various profiles that would be expected for modulators that reduce (gamma(B) = 0.01), have no effect on (gamma(B) = 1) and increase (gamma(B) = 100) the affinity of the agonist for the receptor. It will be seen that modulators that increase the affinity of the receptor for the agonist are the most potent antagonists and may attain a profile of some special negative allosteric modulators referred to as PAM antagonists. In all cases, these modulators will be inverse agonists of constitutive receptor activity. This model presents a strategy for the discovery of PAM antagonists for therapeutic blockade of physiological signaling. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A graphical method to compare the <i>in vivo</i> binding potential of PET radioligands in the absence of a reference region: application to [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28 and [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PBR111 for TSPO imaging	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						graphical analysis; PET; radioligand comparison; specific binding; TSPO	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; GENETIC-POLYMORPHISM; HEALTHY HUMANS; BRAIN; BIODISTRIBUTION; QUANTIFICATION; PARAMETERS; BIOMARKER; AFFINITY; SIGNAL	Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for a reversible central nervous system (CNS) demand a high specific to nonspecific signal characterized by the binding potential (BPND). The quantification of BPND requires the determination of the nondisplaceable binding usually derived from a reference region devoid of the target of interest. However, for many CNS targets, there is no valid reference region available. In such cases, the total volume of distribution (V-T) is often used as the outcome measure, which includes both the specific and nonspecific binding signals. Here we present a graphical method that allows for direct comparison of the binding potential of ligands using the regional V-T data alone via linear regression. The method was first validated using literature data for five serotonin transporter ligands, for which a reference region exists, and then applied to two second generation 18 kDa translocator protein radioligands, namely [C-11]PBR28 and [F-18]PBR111. The analysis determined that [C-11]PBR28, had a higher BPND than [F-18]PBR111.
