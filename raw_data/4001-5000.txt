Recently, F-18-Desmethoxyfallypride (DMFP) has been suggested to increase the diagnostic precision as it is an effective radioligand that allows us to analyze post-synaptic dopamine D2/3 receptors. Nevertheless, the analysis of these data is still poorly covered and its use limited. In order to address this challenge, this paper shows a novel model to automatically distinguish idiopathic parkinsonism from non-idiopathic variants using DMFP data. The proposed method is based on a multiple kernel support vector machine and uses the linear version of this classifier to identify some regions of interest: the olfactory bulb, thalamus, and supplementary motor area. We evaluated the proposed model for both, the binary separation of idiopathic and non-idiopathic parkinsonism and the multigroup separation of parkinsonian variants. These systems achieved accuracy rates higher than 70%, outperforming DaTSCAN neuroimages for this purpose. In addition, a system that combined DaTSCAN and DMFP data was assessed.

Here we used positron emission tomography and the D-3 receptor-preferring radioligand [C-11]-(+)-PHNO during a dual-scan protocol to investigate DA release in response to oral amphetamine in pathological gamblers (n = 12) and healthy controls (n = 11). In contrast with human neuroimaging findings in drug addiction, we report the first evidence that PG is associated with greater DA release in dorsal striatum (54-63% greater [C-11]-(+)-PHNO displacement) than controls. Importantly, dopaminergic response to amphetamine in gamblers was positively predicted by D-3 receptor levels (measured in substantia nigra), and related to gambling severity, allowing for construction of a mechanistic model that could help explain DA contributions to PG. Our results are consistent with a hyperdopaminergic state in PG, and support the hypothesis that dopaminergic sensitization involving D-3-related mechanisms might contribute to the pathophysiology of behavioral addictions.

Methods The synthesized compounds 510 were characterized in radioligand binding (A1, A2A and A3) and adenylyl cyclase activity assays (A2B) to determine the affinity of the compounds for the four human AR (hAR) subtypes. Key findings Coumarinchalcone hybrids were found to be ligands with a novel structure, not reported thus far, that showed varying affinity and selectivity for AR subtypes. Conclusions The coumarinchalcone hybrids in which ring B of the chalcone scaffold was a thiophene (compounds 5 and 9) were found to be the most potent compounds of the series. Compound 9, in which ring A of the chalcone moiety was the phenyl ring of the coumarin, showed similar activity against hA1, hA2A and hA3 ARs, while compound 5, in which ring A of the chalcone was substituted by the benzopyrone ring of the coumarin moiety, showed similar activity only at the hA3 AR and, therefore, was deemed to be selective (Ki (dissociation constant)=5160nm).

The new ligands displayed high binding affinities to SERT (K-i ranging from 0.03 to 1.4 nM). The corresponding F-18 labeled compounds, which can be prepared readily, showed excellent brain uptake and retention after iv injection in rats. The hypothalamus region showed high uptake values between 0.74% and 2.2% dose/g at 120 min after iv injection. Significantly, the hyvothalamus to cerebellum ratios (target to nontarget ratios) at 120 min were 7.8 and 7.7 for [F-18]28 and [F-18]40, respectively. The selective uptake and retention in the hypothalamus, which has a high concentration of SERT binding sites, demonstrated that [F-18]28 and [F-18]40 are promising positron emission computed tomography imaging agents for mapping SERT binding sites in the brain.

Here, we utilized primary neuronal cultures of cerebral cortex from alpha7 nAChR null mutant mice to examine the role of this receptor in modulating the neurotoxic properties of subchronic, "binge" ethanol and beta-amyloid. Knockout of the alpha7 nAChR gene selectively enhanced ethanol-induced neurotoxicity in a gene dosage-related fashion. Susceptibility of cultures to beta-amyloid induced toxicity, however, was unaffected by alpha7 nAChR gene null mutation. Further, beta-amyloid did not inhibit the binding of the highly alpha7-selective radioligand, [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. On the other hand, in studies in Xenopus oocytes ethanol efficaciously inhibited alpha7 nAChR function. These data suggest that alpha7 nAChRs modulate the neurotoxic effects of binge ethanol, but not the neurotoxicity produced by beta-amyloid. It is hypothesized that inhibition of alpha7 nAChRs by ethanol provides partial protection against the neurotoxic properties of subchronic ethanol. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Slifstein, M; Laruelle, M				Slifstein, M; Laruelle, M			Effects of statistical noise on graphic analysis of PET neuroreceptor studies	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; kinetic modeling; graphic analysis; noise	BINDING; REPRODUCIBILITY; RADIOLIGAND; VALIDATION; DOPAMINE; HUMANS; BRAIN	Because of its computational simplicity, the graphic method introduced by Logan et al. is frequently used to analyze time-activity curves of reversible radiotracers measured in brain regions with PET. The graphic method uses a nonlinear transformation of data to variables that have an asymptotically linear relationship. Compared with compartmental analysis of untransformed data, the graphic method enables derivation of regional distribution volumes that are free from assumptions about the underlying compartmental configuration. In this article, we describe statistical bias associated with this nonlinear transformation method. Methods: Theoretic analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and statistical analysis of PET data were used to test the graphic method for bias. Results: Mean zero noise is associated with underestimation of distribution volumes when data are analyzed with graphic analysis, whereas this effect does not occur when the same data are analyzed by nonlinear regression and compartmental analysis. Moreover, this effect depends on the magnitude of the distribution volume, so that the bias is more pronounced in regions with high receptor density than regions with low receptor density or no receptors (region of reference). Conclusion: These results indicate that conventional kinetic analysis of untransformed data is less sensitive to mean zero noise than is graphic analysis of nonlinearly transformed data.

Various experimental approaches, the complex signaling pathways of mammalian cells, and the use of different species orthologues render it difficult to compare and interpret the published results. Thus, the four human histamine receptor subtypes were analyzed side-by-side in the Sf9 insect cell expression system, using radioligand binding assays as well as functional readouts proximal to the receptor activation event (steady-state GTPase assays and [S-35] GTP gamma S assays). The human H1R was co-expressed with the regulators of G protein signaling RGS4 or GAIP, which unmasked a productive interaction between hH(1)R and insect cell G alpha(q). By contrast, functional expression of the hH(2)R required the generation of an hH(2)R-Gs alpha fusion protein to ensure close proximity of G protein and receptor. Fusion of hH(2)R to the long (Gs alpha(L)) or short (Gs alpha(S)) splice variant of G alpha s resulted in comparable constitutive hH(2)R activity, although both G protein variants show different GDP affinities. Medicinal chemistry studies revealed profound species differences between hH(1)R/hH(2)R and their guinea pig orthologues gpH(1)R/gpH(2)R. The causes for these differences were analyzed by molecular modeling in combination with mutational studies. Co-expression of the hH(3)R with G alpha(i1), G alpha(i2), G alpha(i3), and G alpha(i/o) in Sf9 cells revealed high constitutive activity and comparable interaction efficiency with all G protein isoforms. A comparison of various cations (Li+, Na+, K+) and anions (Cl-, Br-, I-) revealed that anions with large radii most efficiently stabilize the inactive hH(3)R state. Potential sodium binding sites in the hH(3)R protein were analyzed by expressing specific hH(3)R mutants in Sf9 cells. In contrast to the hH(3)R, the hH(4)R preferentially couples to co-expressed G alpha(i2) in Sf9 cells. Its high constitutive activity is resistant to NaCl or GTP gamma S. The hH(4)R shows structural instability and adopts a G protein-independent high-affinity state. A detailed characterization of affinity and activity of a series of hH(4)R antagonists/inverse agonists allowed first conclusions about structure/activity relationships for inverse agonists at hH(4)R. In summary, the Sf9 cell system permitted a successful side-by-side comparison of all four human histamine receptor subtypes. This chapter summarizes the results of pharmacological as well as medicinal chemistry/molecular modeling approaches and demonstrates that these data are not only important for a deeper understanding of HxR pharmacology, but also have significant implications for the molecular pharmacology of GPCRs in general.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of copper-64 radiolabeled [DUPA-6-Ahx-(NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH<sub>2</sub>], a novel bivalent targeting vector having affinity for two distinct biomarkers (GRPr/PSMA) of prostate cancer	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Gastrin-releasing peptide; Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Bombesin; Prostate cancer; Copper-64	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN PSMA; IN-VITRO; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; BOMBESIN ANTAGONIST; PEPTIDE; TUMOR; PET; INHIBITORS; EXPRESSION; MICROPET	Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPr) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) are two identifying biomarkers expressed in very high numbers on prostate cancer cells and could serve as a useful tool for molecular targeting and diagnosis of disease via positron-emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to produce the multipurpose, bivalent [DUPA-6-Ahx-(Cu-64-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] radioligand for prostate cancer imaging, where DUPA = (2-[3-(1,3-dicarboxypropyl)-ureido]pentanedioic acid), a small-molecule, PSMA-targeting probe, 6Ahx = 6-aminohexanoic acid, 5-Ava = 5-aminovaleric acid, NODAGA = [2-(4,7-biscarboxymethyl)-1,4,7-(triazonan-1-yl)pentanedioic acid] (a derivative of NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid)), and BBN(7-14)NH2 = bombesin, a GRPr-specific peptide targeting probe. Methods: The PSMA/GRPr dual targeting ligand precursor [DUPA-6-Ahx-K-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2], was synthesized by solid-phase and manual peptide synthesis, after which NODAGA was added via manual conjugation to the epsilon-amine of lysine (K). The new bivalent GRPr/PSMA targeting vector was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC), characterized by electrosprayionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and metallated with (CuCl2)-Cu-64 and (CuCl2)-Cu-nat. The receptor binding affinity was evaluated in human, prostate, PC-3 (GRPr-positive) and LNCaP (PSMA-positive) cells and the tumor-targeting efficacy determined in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) and athymic nude mice bearing PC-3 and LNCaP tumors. Whole-body maximum intensity microPET/CT images of PC-3/LNCaP tumor-bearing mice were obtained 18 h post-injection (p.i.). Results: Competitive binding assays in PC-3 and LNCaP cells indicated high receptor binding affinity for the [DUPA-6-Ahx-(Cu-nat-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] conjugate. MicroPET scintigraphy in PC-3/LNCaP tumor-bearing mice indicated that xenografted tumors were visible at 18 h p.i. with collateral, background radiation also being observed in non-target tissue. Conclusions: DUPA-6-Ahx-(Cu-64-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2] targeting vector, as described herein, is the first example of a dual GRPr-/PSMA-targeting radioligand for molecular of imaging prostate tumors. Detailed in vitro studies and microPET molecular imaging investigations of [DUPA-6-Ahx-(Cu-64-NODAGA)-5-Ava-BBN(7-14)NH2 in tumor-bearing mice indicate that further studies are necessary to optimize uptake and retention of tracer in GRPr- and PSMA-positive tissues.

Agonist radioligands may target specifically the G protein-coupled state of the receptors and thereby provide a more meaningful assessment of available receptors than antagonist radioligands. In the current study we characterized [C-11]Cimbi-36 receptor binding in the primate brain. On five experimental days, a total of 14 PET measurements were conducted in three female rhesus monkeys. On each day, PET measurements were conducted after intravenous injection of [C-11]Cimbi-36 during baseline conditions and after intravenous infusion of the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist ketanserin (n = 3) or the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB 242084 (n = 2). On four of the experimental days an additional baseline PET measurement was conducted after injection of [C-11]MDL 100907. All PET measurements were performed for 2 h in a HRRT PET system and arterial blood was obtained for measurement of the [C-11]Cimbi-36 input function. Quantification of [C-11] Cimbi-36 receptor binding was performed using kinetic and graphical analysis. After injection of [C-11]Cimbi-36 the regional distribution of radioactivity in brain was in accordance with the known 5-HT2 receptor distribution. The two-tissue compartment model was superior for the description of the time-radioactivity curves of all examined brain regions. BPND values obtained with reference tissue models correlated with corresponding values obtained with kinetic modeling. Administration of ketanserin decreased the binding in all brain regions but did not affect the cerebellar distribution volume. The BPND of [C-11]Cimbi-36 was 56 +/- 8% of [C-11]MDL 100907 across cortical regions, but higher in other brain regions including choroid plexus. After administration of SB 242084, [C-11]Cimbi-36 binding was nearly completely inhibited in the choroid plexus, partly reduced in several subcortical regions (e.g. hippocampus), but not affected in the cortical regions. In conclusion, the receptor binding of [C-11]Cimbi-36 can be quantified using kinetic modeling and the cerebellum was found to be a suitable reference region. The difference between [C-11]Cimbi-36 and [C-11]MDL 100907 binding in the choroid plexus is related to 5-HTK receptor binding of [C-11]Cimbi-36. [C-11]Cimbi-36 is the first agonist radioligand suitable for examination of 5-HT2A receptors in the cortical regions and of 5-HT2C receptors in the choroid plexus of the primate brain.

A deep understanding of mu OR-ligand interactions is necessary for future design of peptide-based opioid analgesics. To explore the requirements of the mu OR binding pocket, eight new analogues of our cyclic peptide Tyr-c[d-Lys-Phe-Phe-Asp]NH2 displaying high mu OR affinity were synthesized, in which Phe in either the third or fourth position was replaced by various derivatives of this amino acid (beta(3)-Phe, homoPhe, beta(3)-homoPhe and PhGly). The aim of this research was to examine the structural effects of such modifications on the bioactivity, and both experimental and theoretical methods were used. The binding of the cyclic analogues to all three OR types (mu, delta, kappa) was assessed by radioligand competitive binding assay, and their functional activity was determined in a calcium mobilization assay. In order to provide structural hypotheses explaining the obtained experimental affinities, the complexes of the cyclic peptides with mu OR were subjected to molecular modeling.

Radioligand binding assay, performed on guinea pig brain membranes, identified 25b (1-(1,4-dioxaspiro[4.5]clecan-2-ylmethyl)-4-benzylpiperazine) as the most interesting compound of the series, displaying high affinity and selectivity for sigma R-1 (pK(i)sigma(1) = 9.13; sigma(1)/sigma(2) = 47). The ability of 25b to modulate the analgesic effect of the K agonist (-)-U-50,488H and mu agonist morphine was evaluated in vivo by radiant heat tail-flick test. It exhibited anti-opioid effects on both K and receptor-mediated analgesia, suggesting an agonistic behavior at sigma R-1. Docking studies were performed on the theoretical sigma R-1 homology model. The present work represents a new starting point for the design of more potent and selective sigma R-1 ligands. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Introduction of fluorine into the indazole ring of A and B reduced both binding affinity and alpha(2)-AR/I-1 imidazoline binding site selectivity. The most alpha(2)-AR-selective ligands were 6-fluoro-1-[(imidazolidin-2-yl)imino]-1H-indazole (6c) and 7-fluoro-1-[(imidazolidin-2-yl)imino]-1H-indazole (6d). The in vivo cardiovascular properties of fluorinated derivatives of A and B revealed that in both cases the C-7 fluorination leads to compounds with the highest hypotensive and bradycardic activities. The alpha(2)-AR partial agonist 6c was prepared as a potential lead compound for development of a radiotracer for PET imaging of brain alpha(2)-ARs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

They displayed binding affinities for A beta(1-42) aggregates that varied from 2.7 to 101.6 nM. Seven ligands with high affinity were selected for F-18 labeling. In vitro autoradiography results confirmed the high affinity of these radiotracers. In vivo biodistribution experiments in normal mice indicated that the radiotracers with a short FPEG chain (n = 1, displayed high initial uptake into and rapid washout from the brain. One of the 2-pyridinylbenzoxazole derivatives, [F-18]-5-(5-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzo[d]oxazol-2-yl)-N-methylpyridin-2-amine ([F-18]32) (K-i = 8.0 +/- 3.2 nM) displayed a brain(2min)/brain(60min) ratio of 4.66, which is highly desirable for A beta imaging agents. Target specific binding of [F-18]32 to A beta plaques was validated by ex vivo autoradiographic experiment with transgenic model mouse. Overall, [F-18]32 is a promising A beta imaging agent for PET and merits further evaluation in human subjects.

The Tc-99m and corresponding rhenium complexes were synthesized by coupling monoamine-monoamide dithiol (MAMA) and bis(aminoethanethiol) (BAT) chelating ligand via a pentyloxy spacer to phenylbenzoxazole. The fluorescent rhenium complexes 6 and 9 selectively stainined the beta-amyloid plaques on the sections of transgenic mouse, and showed high affinity for A beta((1-42)) aggregates (K-i = 11.1 nM and 14.3 nM, respectively). Autoradiography in vitro indicated that [Tc-99m]6 clearly labeled beta-amyloid plaques on the sections of transgenic mouse. Biodistribution experiments in normal mice revealed that [Tc-99m]6 displayed moderate initial brain uptake (0.81% ID/g at 2 min), and quickly washed out from the brain (0.25% ID/g at 60 min). The preliminary results indicate that the properties of [Tc-99m]6 are promising, although additional refinements are needed to improve the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.

In membranes from CHO cells transfected with the human NPFF1 receptor, [H-3]-NPVF labelled one class of binding sites with a high affinity (Bmax = 4 pmol/mg protein, Kd = 2.65 nM). In membranes from CHO cells transfected with the human NPFF2 receptor, [H-3]-EYF labelled one class of binding sites with a high affinity (Bmax = 16 pmol/mg protein, Kd = 0.54 nM). Both radioligands exhibited time-dependent binding, low (10-20%) non-specific binding and poor cross-reactivity towards the related receptor subtype. The potency of different NPFF ligands to displace [H-3]-NPVF and [H-3]-EYF binding profiles was in good agreement with the profile previously measured by using I-125-probes (NPFF1 receptor: NPVF >= 1DMe = SPA-NPFF > NPFF = SQA-NPFF = QFW-NPSF > NPSF > RF9; NPFF2 receptor: SPA-NPFF > > SQA-NPFF = QFW-NPSF = 1DMe = NPFF >> NPSF = NPVF > RF9). Therefore, [H-3]-NPVF and [H-3]-EYF are new valuable tools for performing binding on NPFF receptors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Synthesis and ligand recognition of paracetamol selective polymers: semi-covalent <i>versus</i> non-covalent molecular imprinting	ORGANIC & BIOMOLECULAR CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CHIRAL RESOLUTION; RECEPTORS	Three molecular imprinting strategies, each based upon a series of ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) cross-linked co-polymers, have been used to produce materials selective for the commonly used analgesic and antipyretic agent paracetamol (p-acetaminophen or 4-acetamidophenol) (1). The polymers were synthesised using either a semi-covalent imprinting strategy based upon 4-acetamidophenyl-(4-vinylphenyl) carbonate (4) or a non-covalent strategy based on methacrylic acid (MAA) as the functional monomer, or by employing a combination of these strategies. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated low template affinity in polymers offering only a single electrostatic interaction point for recognition via the phenolic residue in the template, whereas binding was substantially increased upon the introduction of a second binding mode, namely interaction at the acetamide moiety. HPLC analyses revealed no imprinting effect in the purely semi-covalent system, and only a minor effect in the purely non-covalent systems. However, a pronounced imprinting effect was demonstrated for polymers prepared by a combination of semi-covalent and non-covalent imprinting. This study illustrates a limitation of both the non-covalent and the semi-covalent strategies when it comes to achieving imprinted selectivity for small and poorly functionalised templates such as paracetamol. Parallels with conclusions from studies with antibodies are discussed.

Recently, two G-protein-coupled receptors for NmU (NmU1R and NmU2R) have been cloned having approximately 50% homology. They have distinct patterns of expression suggesting they may have different biological functions. This study provides a comprehensive characterization of both NmU receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. [I-125]hNmU binding to the recombinant NmU receptors was rapid, saturable, of high affinity and to a single population of binding sites. Exposure of these cells to NmU isopeptides resulted in an increase in intracellular [Ca2+](i) release (EC50 value of 0.50 +/- 0.10 nmol/l) and inositol phosphate formation (EC50 1.6 +/- 0.2 and 1.50 +/- 0.4 nmol/l for NmU1R and NmU2R respectively). Furthermore, hNmU inhibited forskolin (3 mumol/l)-stimulated accumulation of cAMP in intact HEK-293 cells expressing either NmU1R or NmU2R. The inhibitory effect was significant for the cells expressing NmU2R with IC50 value of 0.80 +/- 0.21 nmol/l. In summary, both NmU1R and NmU2R in HEK-293 cells have similar signaling capability.

Although we have previously reported that secretin receptor mRNA was upregulated in cholangiocytes after BDL [3], the cholangiocyte secretin receptor has not been functionally characterized or quantified after BDL. In this work, we used a novel, photolabile and biologically active analogue of secretin to quantify and characterize secretin receptors on cholangiocytes isolated from normal and BDL rats. The cholangiocyte secretin receptor bound radioligand with high affinity and in a rapid, reversible, and temperature-dependent manner. While receptors on cholangiocytes from normal and BDL rats were functionally and biochemically identical, receptor density on cholangiocytes was increased 5-fold following BDL. The combination of increased cell number with increased functional secretin receptors per cell is due to the fact that cholangiocyte hyperplasia represents a reactive response to a cholestatic condition and this effort on the part of the organism to maintain bile secretion, explains the increased hormone-responsive choleresis observed after BDL and may reflect an adaptive response of the organism to cholestasis.

These neurones may be visualised by single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the cocaine analogue 2 beta-carboxymethyl-3-beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane ([(123)]beta-CIT), which labels the dopamine reuptake sites in the nerve terminals. In order to evaluate the possibility to predict the outcome of ECT a prospective study was performed with six PD patients in whom the [I-123]beta-CIT uptake was measured before and after an electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) series. The side-to-side difference in the radiotracer uptake was found to be significantly lower in striatum located contralaterally to the part of the body with the most pronounced symptomathology. No significant change in uptake of the radioligand was seen after ECT. Patients with best uptake and thus with less advanced PD improved most after ECT. The possibility to use the [I-123]beta-CIT uptake to predict the outcome of ECT treatment has to be further evaluated.

Preclinical Evaluation of a High-Affinity Sarcophagine-Containing PSMA Ligand for <SUP>64</SUP>Cu/<SUP>67</SUP>Cu-Based Theranostics in Prostate Cancer	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						PSMA; prostate cancer; theranostics; copper-67; positron emission tomography	TARGETED RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PET/CT; INHIBITORS; COPPER-64; CHELATORS	The application of small molecules targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has emerged as a highly promising clinical strategy for visualization and treatment of prostate cancer. Ligands that integrate the ability to both quantify the distribution of radioactivity and treat disease through the use of a matched pair of radionudides have particular value in clinical and regulatory settings. In this study, we describe the development and preclinical evaluation of RPS-085, a Wend that binds PSMA and serum albumin and exploits the Cu-64/67 radionuclide pair for prostate cancer theranostics. RPS-085 was synthesized by conjugation of a PSMA-targeting moiety, an N-epsilon-(2-(4-iodophenyl)acetyl)lysine albumin binding group, and a bifunction-alized MeCOSar chelator. The IC50 of the metal-free RPS-085 was determined in a competitive binding assay. The affinity for human serum albumin of the radiolabeled compound was determined by high-performance affinity chromatography. Radiolabeling was performed in NH4OAc buffer at 25 degrees C. The stability of the radiolabeled compounds was assessed in vitro and in vivo. The biodistribution of [Cu-64/67]Cu-RPS-085 was determined following intravenous administration to male BALB/c mice bearing LNCaP tumor xenografts. The radiochemical yields of [Cu-64/67]Cu-RPS-085 were nearly quantitative after 20 min. The metal-free complex is a potent inhibitor of PSMA (IC50 = 29 +/- 2 nM), and the radiolabeled compound has moderate affinity for human serum albumin (K-d = 9.9 +/- 1.7 mu M). Accumulation of the tracer in mice was primarily evident in tumor and kidneys. Activity in all other tissues, including blood, was negligible, and the radiolabeled compounds demonstrated high stability in vitro and in vivo. Tumor activity reached a maximum at 4 h post injection (p.i.) and cleared gradually over a period of 96 h. By contrast, activity in the kidney cleared rapidly from 4 to 24 h p.i. As a consequence, by 24 h p.i., the tumor-to-kidney ratio exceeds 2, and the predicted dose to tumors is significantly greater than the dose to kidneys. [Cu-64]Cu-RPS-085 combines rapid tissue distribution and clearance with prolonged retention in LNCaP tumor xenografts. The pharmacokinetics should enable radioligand therapy using [Cu-67]Cu-RPS-085. By virtue of its rapid kidney dearance, the therapeutic index of [Cu-67]Cu-RPS-085 likely compares favorably to its parent structure, [Lu-177]Lu-RPS-063, a highly avid PSMA-targeting compound. On this basis, [Cu-64/67]Cu-RPS-085 show great promise as PSMA-targeting theranostic ligands for prostate cancer imaging and therapy.

In current study, radiolabeling and preclinical evaluation of 4-benzyl-1-(3-[I-125]-iodobenzylsulfonyl)piperidine, 4-B-[I-125]IBSP, in human ductal breast carcinoma (T47D) cells and in breast adenocarcinoma-bearing BALB/c mice are described. Methods Radioiodination of this new sigma ligand was performed by a palladium-catalyzed stannylation approach followed by oxidative iododestannylation reaction using Iodo-Gen. Competition-binding assays for binding of 4-B-[I-125]IBSP to guinea pig brain membranes and to T47D cells were performed with known sigma ligands. The selectivity and binding characteristics (B (max) and K (d)) were analyzed. In vitro stability and in vivo blood metabolism studies were also evaluated. Moreover, biodistribution studies were performed in normal and into the tumor-bearing mice at interval time points post-injection (p.i.). Both in vitro and in vivo blockade experiments were done in the presence of the sigma receptors blocking agents. Results Radioiodinated ligand was obtained in high yield and high specific activity. The sigma inhibition constants (K (i), nM) for 4-(3-iodobenzyl)-1-(benzylsulfonyl)piperazine (4-IBBSPz), (+)-pentazocine, haloperidol, DTG, and 4-B-IBSP were 1.37 +/- 0.19, 3.90 +/- 0.77, 2.69 +/- 0.33, 30.62 +/- 2.01, and 0.61 +/- 0.05, respectively. 4-B-[I-125]IBSP bound to sigma receptor sites preferably to very high-affinity binding sites on T47D cells. The radioligand showed acceptable in vitro and in vivo stabilities in the blood pool. However, in vivo biodistribution studies in normal Swiss albino mice revealed fast clearance of 4-B-[I-125]IBSP from blood and the other normal organs. Biodistribution experiments of 4-B-[I-125]IBSP in breast adenocarcinoma tumor-bearing BALB/c mice showed a relatively high tumor uptake at 30 min p.i. (4.13 +/- 0.95) that reaches to 1.57 +/- 0.24 even after 240 min p.i. A pre-injection of 4-B-IBSP and haloperidol with 4-B-[I-125]IBSP resulted in 36-57% decrease in activity in the tumor, liver, and brain at 60 min p.i. Conclusions The high affinity of 4-B-[I-125]IBSP to sigma receptor-binding sites, its relatively high uptake, and preferential retention in the tumor as well as an increasing trend observed in the tumor to blood and in the tumor to muscle ratios suggests that an iodine-123 labeled counterpart, 4-B-[I-123]IBSP, would be a promising sigma radioligand for pursuing further studies to assess its potential for breast tumors imaging with SPECT.

Sex drive shows substantial variation across humans, and it is possible that individual differences in MOR availability underlie interindividual of variation in human sex drive. We measured healthy male subjects' (n = 52) brain's MOR availability with positron emission tomography (PET) using an agonist radioligand, [C-11]carfentanil, that has high affinity for MORs. Sex drive was measured using self-reports of engaging in sexual behaviour (sex with partner and masturbating). Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis revealed that sex drive was positively associated with MOR availability in cortical and subcortical areas, notably in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and cingulate cortices. These results were replicated in full-volume GLM analysis. These widespread effects are in line with high spatial autocorrelation in MOR expression in human brain. Complementary voxel-based morphometry analysis (n = 108) of anatomical MR images provided limited evidence for positive association between sex drive and cortical density in the midcingulate cortex. We conclude that endogenous MOR tone is associated with individual differences in sex drive in human males.

Thus, we aimed to establish a fully automated procedure for the synthesis and purification of [C-11]DASB with a high degree of reliability reducing the overall synthesis time while conserving high yields and purity. The optimized [C-11]DASB synthesis was applied in more than 60 applications with a very low failure rate (3.2%). We obtained yields up to 8.9 GBq (average 5.3 +/- 1.6 GBq). Radiochemical yields based on [C-11]CH3I, (corrected for decay) were 66.3 +/- 6.9% with a specific radioactivity (A(s)) of 86.8 +/- 24.3 GBq/mu mol (both at the end of synthesis, EOS). Time consumption was kept to a minimum, resulting in 43 min from end of bombardment to release of the product after quality control. Form our data, it is evident that the presented method can be implemented for routine preparations of [C-11]DASB with high reliability. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This core is derived from the highly potent dihydroquinoxalinone scaffold published recently by researchers at Merck (Ha et al Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005,331,159-166). Despite the considerably limited chemical space of B1 antagonists, the synthesized compounds still showed significant biological activity. None of the four most potent compounds showed significant activity on the bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R), consequently they can be considered as valuable starting points for designing more potent and selective B1 antagonists. Furthermore, the synthesis of these aspartic acid derivatives is much simpler than that of the original Merck compounds suggesting efficient parallel synthesis approaches during their optimization. Docking known and novel B1 antagonists into the refined B1R homology model including the second extracellular loop (EC2) underlined the importance of this loop in ligand binding. Comparative binding mode analysis revealed that our novel compounds bind similar to the dihydroquinoxalinone template. Our results indicate that the rigid core of the dihydroquinoxalinone containing B1 antagonists is not crucial for maintaining B1 activity.

Subsequently the synthesized compounds were subjected to in vitro radioligand M1 receptor affinity studies, IP3 formation studies and also to in vivo pharmacological evaluation of memory and learning in male Wistar rats. Derivatives with chloro (9f) and methoxy (9c) groups on the para position of the benzene ring attached to the nitrogen of thiourea showed several fold high affinity for the M1 receptor (in vitro) among all the synthesized molecules 9(a -j), and also significantly elevated IP3 levels and as well elicited beneficial effects in vivo in memory and learning models in rats (rodent memory evaluation, plus and Y maze studies).

Radiosyntheses of [C-11]5, 6, 7 or 8 was accomplished by N-methylation of the corresponding desmethyl precursors with [C-11]methyl iodide in the presence of NaH in dimethylformamide (DMF), resulting in 25% to 77% radiochemical yield and specific activitiy of 20 to 150 MBq/nmol. Each of the labeled compounds was injected in ddY mice, and the radioactivity and weight of dissected peripheral organs and brain regions were measured. Organ distribution of [C-11]7 was consistent with the known PBR distribution. Moreover, [C-11]7 showed the best combination of brain uptake and PBR binding, leading to its high retention in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, areas where PBR density is high in mouse brain.

METHODS: [H-3]ryanodine binding assays were performed to examine the effect of Zn2+ on ryanodine binding to the SR in the presence of pyrithione sodium (PyNa), a specific Zn2+ ionophore. RESULTS: As a control, PyNa up to 50 mumol/L did not induce any effect on ryanodine binding to the SR of cardiac muscle. But PyNa 1-100 mumol/L increased ryanodine binding in skeletal muscle with maximum binding (222.2 %+/-20.9 % of the control) and inhibited ryanodine binding to 50 % of the control at about 500 mumol/L. In the presence of PyNa 10 and 50 mumol/L the dose-dependence of the effect of Zn2+ in cardiac muscle was still monophasic and not changed by PyNa, while the biphasic effect of Zn2+ in skeletal muscle became monophasic. CONCLUSION: Different permeability of the SR to Zn2+ may account for the differential effects of Zn2+ on ryanodine binding in skeletal and cardiac muscles. PyNa is not a strictly specific Zn2+ ionophore.

Polymers made by different methods have, so far, never been directly compared and tested under the same conditions to assess their potential rebinding characteristics, and hence the effect of the production method on the performance of the final imprinted material. In this comparative study, polymers with a similar composition were synthesised by bulk, suspension, emulsion, two-step swelling and precipitation polymerisation. The resulting imprinted materials were characterised physically and their capacity to rebind propranolol under identical analytical conditions was assessed from organic and aqueous solutions by radioligand binding. The results showed that, when specific rebinding of ligand was measured in an organic solution (toluene + 0.5% acetic acid), the methods compared as follows: precipitation (50%) > suspension (40%) > bulk (35%) > core-shell (15%) > two-step swelling (10%). When specific rebinding from an aqueous solution (sodium citrate 25 mM + 0.5% acetic acid + 2% ethanol, pH 4.6) was measured, the results were somewhat different: two-step swelling (20%) congruent to suspension (19%) congruent to bulk (19%) > core-shell (15%) > precipitation (0%).

Our hypothesis was that late onset type 1 alcoholics have also abnormal extrastriatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor distribution. We performed binding, heterogeneity and laterality analysis of extrastriatal and striatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors in nine late onset male alcoholics and in 12 age-matched healthy males. A radioligand, [I-123]epidepride was used in high resolution single-photon emission tomography (SPET). Specific binding of epidepride in the left temporal pole was significantly (P < 0.05) lower in type 1 alcoholics (0.74 +/- 0.14 ml/ml) than in controls (0.89 +/- 0.14 ml/ml). In alcoholics, there was no normal left-to-right asymmetry of the temporal cortical heterogeneity of epidepride distribution observed in control males (0.89 +/- 0.19 vs. 1.10 +/- 0.19; P < 0.05). The results suggest that the specific binding of dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors in late type 1 alcoholics is decreased and its laterality in the temporal brain is altered from normal.

PET Imaging of Pancreatic Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> Receptor Density with <SUP>11</SUP>C-(+)-PHNO in Type 1 Diabetes	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						diabetes; pancreas; beta-cell mass; PHNO; PET	BETA-CELL MASS; INSULIN-SECRETION; EXPRESSION; BINDING; ISLETS; D3	Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has traditionally been characterized by a complete destruction of beta-cell mass (BCM); however, there is growing evidence of possible residual BCM present in T1DM. Given the absence of in vivo tools to measure BCM, routine clinical measures of beta-cell function (e.g., C-peptide release) may not reflect BCM. We previously demonstrated the potential utility of PET imaging with the dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptor agonist 3,4,4a,5,6,10b-hexahydro-2H-naphtho[1,2-b][1,4]oxazin-9-ol (C-11-(1)-PHNO) to differentiate between healthy control (HC) and T1DM individuals. Methods: Sixteen individuals participated (10 men, 6 women; 9 HCs, 7 T1DMs). The average duration of diabetes was 18 +/- 6 y (range, 14-30 y). Individuals underwent PET/CT scanning with a 120-min dynamic PET scan centered on the pancreas. One- and 2-tissue-compartment models were used to estimate pancreas and spleen distribution volume. Reference region approaches (spleen as reference) were also investigated. Quantitative PET measures were correlated with clinical outcome measures. Immunohistochemistry was performed to examine colocalization of dopamine receptors with endocrine hormones in HC and T1DM pancreatic tissue. Results: C-peptide release was not detectable in any T1DM individuals, whereas proinsulin was detectable in 3 of 5 T1DM individuals. Pancreas SUV ratio minus 1 (SUVR-1) (20-30 min; spleen as reference region) demonstrated a statistically significant reduction (-36.2%) in radioligand binding (HCs, 5.6; T1DMs, 3.6; P = 0.03). Age at diagnosis correlated significantly with pancreas SUVR-1 (20-30 min) (R-2 = 0.67, P = 0.025). Duration of diabetes did not significantly correlate with pancreas SUVR-1 (20-30 min) (R-2 = 0.36, P = 0.16). Mean acute C-peptide response to arginine at maximal glycemic potentiation did not significantly correlate with SUVR- 1 (20-30 min) (R-2 = 0.57, P = 0.05), nor did mean baseline proinsulin (R-2 = 0.45, P = 0.10). Immunohistochemistry demonstrated colocalization of dopamine D-3 receptor and dopamine D-2 receptor in HCs. No colocalization of the dopamine D-3 receptor or dopamine D-2 receptor was seen with somatostatin, glucagon, or polypeptide Y. In a separate T1DM individual, no immunostaining was seen with dopamine D-3 receptor, dopamine D-2 receptor, or insulin antibodies, suggesting that loss of endocrine dopamine D-3 receptor and dopamine D-2 receptor expression accompanies loss of beta-cell functional insulin secretory capacity. Conclusion: Thirty-minute scan durations and SUVR-1 provide quantitative outcome measures for C-11-(1)-PHNO, a dopamine D-3 receptor-preferring agonist PET radioligand, to differentiate BCM in T1DM and HCs.

II. Screen for binding activity at the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes	PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						medicinal plants; dopamine receptors; dopamine receptor agonists; dopamine receptor antagonists	INVERSE AGONIST ACTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RAT; COCAINE; EXPRESSION; ANTIBODIES; CELLS; ANTAGONISTS; PROTEIN; CLONING	Aqueous, organic and alcoholic extracts of 163 Bolivian, Chinese and Pakistani medicinal plants were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the binding of radioligands selective for the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes expressed in Sf9 cells. Based upon the results of the initial screen, 25 extracts were selected for further evaluation. Concentration-response competitive radioligand binding studies were performed to obtain IC50 values for the inhibition of the binding at D1 or D2 receptors by the selected extracts. The D1 :D2 receptor ratio of IC50 values for the extracts ranged from approximately two-fold selective for the D 1 receptor to threefold selective for the D2 receptor. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are known to be linked to the activation and inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, respectively. Therefore, the selected extracts were tested for the ability to either a) stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity using stably transfected HEK 293 cells expressing human D1 receptors (hD1-HEK) or b) inhibit forskolin-dependent stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity in stably transfected HEK 293 cells expressing rat D2 dopamine receptors (rD2-HEK). Two extracts were found to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity in hD1-HEK cells. However, similar results were observed when untransfected HEK cells were used, suggesting that the ability of these two extracts to increase cAMP levels in hD1-HEK cells was not mediated through a D1-like dopamine receptor. While the majority of extracts did not have an effect on forskolin-dependent stimulation in rD2-HEK cells, six extracts were capable of inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity in these cells. For five of these extracts, the inhibitory effect appeared to be dependent upon the expression of D2 receptors because no inhibitory effect was observed when untransfected HEK 293 cells were used. In summary, the results of this preliminary radioligand binding and functional activity screen of extracts from medicinal plants for pharmacologic activity at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors indicated that the majority of components capable of binding to the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor subtypes appeared to be essentially nonselective. While none of the selected extracts were found to have agonist activity at D1 receptors, several of the extracts exhibited inverse agonist activity at D1 dopamine receptors. Five of the extracts appeared to be agonists at D2 dopamine receptors. Therefore, several classes of extracts were identified which appeared to contained unique combinations of the following pharmacologic properties: D1 dopamine receptor antagonist, D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, D1 receptor inverse agonists and D2 receptor agonists. In addition, two of the extracts tested appeared to modulate adenylyl cyclase activity, but this activity did not appear to be mediated through activation of a dopamine receptor subtype.

The scaffold they are based upon is a deaza variation of a previously reported collection of 3-amino-5,6-diaryl-1,2,4-triazines, members of which had a sub-nanomolar affinity but limited selectivity over the A(2A) subtype. Initially, similar structure-affinity relationships at the 5-aryl ring were established, and then emphasis was put on increasing selectivity at the hA(1)AR by introducing substituents on the N-2-position, all the while maintaining a nanomolar affinity. Compound 3z, bearing a trans 4-hydroxycyclohexyl substituent, was identified as a potent (K-i(hA(1)AR) = 7.7 nM) and selective (K-i(hA(2)AAR) = 1389 nM) antagonist at the human adenosine A(1) receptor. Computational docking was effected at the A(1) and A(2A) subtypes, rationalizing the effect of the 4-hydroxycyclohexyl substituent on selectivity, in relation with the nature of the substituent on the 5-position of the pyrimidine.

The binding efficiency of the phenylamine-group-coated gel was determined to be 65 %, providing a binding capacity of His-tagged protein up to the gram level. Using His-tagged beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) as a probe, we developed a new mathematical model to elucidate the interactions between the receptor and five ligands (methoxyphenamine, terbutaline, salbutamol, tulobuterol and fenoterol). These drugs proved to only have one type of binding site on the immobilised beta(2)-AR, yielding higher association constants and numbers of binding sites than random attachment assays. The association constants determined by the new model positively correlated to the values from a radioligand binding method, with a regression equation of y = 1.75x -aEuro parts per thousand 7.18 and a correlation coefficient of 0.9807. The oriented method resulted in a high binding capacity and quantitative immobilisation of the His-tagged protein. The proposed model can be used to determine the interactions between the ligands and the immobilised protein with the advantages of drug and time saving.

PET Imaging of Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor-Induced Effects on α4β2 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Binding	SYNAPSE			English	Article						PET; [F-18]nifene; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors; physostigmine; galanthamine	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GALANTAMINE	Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs) are drugs that increase synaptic acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations and are under investigation as treatments for symptoms accompanying Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this work was to use PET imaging to evaluate alterations of in vivo 42 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) binding induced by the AChEIs physostigmine (PHY) and galanthamine (GAL). The 42 nAChR-specific radioligand [F-18]nifene was used to examine the effects of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg PHY, 5 mg/kg GAL, and saline in three separate experiments all performed on each of two rat subjects. A 60-min bolus-infusion protocol was used with drug administered after 30 min. Data from the thalamus and cortex were analyzed with a graphical model accounting for neurotransmitter activation using the cerebellum as a reference region to test for transient competition with bound [F-18]nifene. Significant [F-18]nifene displacement was detected in both regions during one PHY and both GAL studies, while no significant competition was observed in both saline studies. This preliminary work indicates the viability of [F-18]nifene in detecting increases in synaptic ACh induced by AChEIs. Synapse 67:882-886, 2013. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Radioligand binding studies using [H-3]methyllycaconitine and NS14490 as competitor showed a good target affinity (K-i,K-alpha 7 = 2.5 nM) and a high selectivity towards other nAChRs. Radiosynthesis of [F-18]NS14490 was performed by two different labelling procedures: a two-step synthesis using a prosthetic group, which led to 7% labelling yield, and the convenient direct nucleophilic substitution of the corresponding tosylate precursor, which resulted in 70% labelling yield. After optimisation of the isolation, purification and formulation process, biodistribution studies were performed in CD-1 mice. The brain uptake of [F-18]NS14490 was comparably low (0.16% ID g(-1) wet weight at 5 min p.i.). The radiotracer showed a high metabolic stability in plasma and brain. Also, the target specificity was proven by pre-administration of a highly affine alpha 7 ligand providing a rationale basis for further in vivo evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radioligands for imaging with PET are required for this purpose. We synthesized new ligands from a 3,4-diarylpyrazoline platform of which (-)-12a ((-)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N'-[(4-cyanophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-phenyl-4,5-dihydro- 1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine) was found to have high-affinity and selectivity for binding to CB, receptors. (-)-12a and its lower affinity enantiomer ((+)-12a) were labeled with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) using [(11)C]cyanide ion as labeling agent and evaluated as PET radioligands in cynomolgus monkeys. After injection of [(11)C](-)-12a, there was high uptake and retention of radioactivity across brain according to the rank order of CB, receptor densities. The distomer, [(11)C](+)-12a, failed to give a sustained CB1 receptor-specific distribution. Polar radiometabolites of [(11)C]-12a appeared moderately slowly in plasma. Radioligand [(11)C](-)-12a is promising for the study of brain CB, receptors and merits further investigation in human subjects.

In vivo assessment of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MRB as a prospective PET ligand for imaging the norepinephrine transporter	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						brain receptors and neurotransmitters; psychiatry; PET; animal imaging; kinetic modelling	H-3 NISOXETINE; UPTAKE SITES; BINDING; BRAIN; RADIOTRACERS	Purpose Antagonism of norepinephrine reuptake is now an important pharmacological strategy in the treatment of anxiety and depressive disorders, and many antidepressants have substantial potential occupancy of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) at recommended dosages. Despite the importance of understanding this transporter's role in psychiatric disease and treatment, a suitable radioligand for studying NET has been slow to emerge. (S,S)-Methylreboxetine (MRB) is among the more promising ligands recently adapted for positron emission tomography (PET), and the present study aimed to evaluate its potential for use in higher primates. Methods Affinities for various brain targets were determined in vitro. PET studies were conducted in baboon under both test-retest and blocking conditions using 1 mg/kg nisoxetine. Results MRB has sixfold higher affinity for NET than the serotonin transporter, and negligible affinity for other sites. PET studies in baboons showed little regional heterogeneity in binding and were minimally affected by pretreatment with the NET antagonist nisoxetine. Conclusion Despite improvement over previous ligands for imaging NET in vivo, the low signal to noise ratio indicates [C-11]MRB lacks sensitivity and reliability as a PET radiotracer in humans.

These compounds were now comparable in their potency to the bicyclic heteroaromatic-based compounds 5 (JB93182) and 6 (JB95008), from which the initial examples were designed using a field-point based molecular modeling approach. They were also orally active as judged by their inhibition of pentagastrin stimulated acid secretion in conscious dogs, in contrast to the bicyclic heteroaromatic-based compounds, which were ineffective because of biliary elimination. Increasing the hydrophilicity through replacement of a particular methylene group with an ether oxygen, as in 3-{[5-(adamantan-1-yloxymethyl)-2-cyclohexyl-1H-imidazole-4-carbonyl]amino}benzoic acid (53), had little effect on the receptor affinity but significantly increased the oral potency. Comparison of the plasma pharmacokinetics and the inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid output following bolus intraduodenal administration of both. 53 and 6 indicated that 53 was well absorbed, had a longer half-life, and was not subject to the elimination pathways of the earlier series.

Sila-substitution of the quaternary carbon atom of the histaminic H-1 antagonist fexofenadine (2a) affords sila-fexofenadine (2b; R3COH --> R3SiOH). The silicon compounds rac-1b, rac-1c, rac-1d, and rac-2b were synthesized in multistep syntheses, and the identities of these compounds and their precursors were established by elemental analyses and multinuclear NMR studies. Some of the precursors were additionally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The pharmacological profiles of rac-1a, rac-1b, rac-1c, rac-1d, rac-2a, and rac-2b were assessed across a range of histaminic receptor binding assays (radioligand binding studies at histamine central H-1, peripheral H-1, H-2, and H-3 receptors). The silicon compounds, within experimental error, exhibited an affinity and selectivity profile similar to their corresponding carbon analogues.

Besides alkyl-aryl ether synthesis using n.c.a. 4-[F-18]fluorophenol the diaryl ether coupling is an attractive synthetic method to enlarge the spectrum of interesting labelling procedures. As examples the syntheses of n.c.a. 2-(4-[F-18]fluorophenoxy)-N,N-dimethylbenzylamine and n.c.a. 2-(4-[F-18]fluorophenoxy)-N-methylbenzylamine were realized by an Ullmann ether synthesis of corresponding 2-bromobenzoic acid amides using tetrakis(acetonitrile)copper(I) hexafluorophosphate as catalyst and a subsequent reduction of the amides formed. The radiochemical yield of the coupling varied between 5 and 65% based on labelled 4-[F-18]fluorophenol. Both compounds are structural analogues of recently published radiotracers for imaging the serotonin reuptake transporter sites (SERT). However, in vitro binding assays of both molecules showed only a low affinity towards monoamine transporters. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

[C-11]2 labelling procedures were based on the use of immobilized Grignard reagent and the acylation of (S)-4-phenylthio-L-proline methyl ester (5) with C-11-labelled methacryloyl chloride, followed by a Michael addition with thiobenzoic acid. The radiochemical yield was 5-10% (EOB, decay corrected) and specific radioactivity ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 Ci/mumol (18.5-55.5 GBq/mumol). Preliminary in vivo human evaluation of [C-11]2 showed that the drug accumulates in organs which express high levels of ACE, like lungs and kidneys, and in organs involved in drug metabolism such as the liver and gall bladder.

The DRN has a high density of the type 2 receptor (CRF2), and so the present experiments explored the impact of CRF2 activation within the DRN on 5-HT function. The intra-DRN administration of the selective CRF2 agonist urocortin 2 (Ucn 2) dose dependently increased 5-HT efflux in the basolateral amygdala, a projection region of the DRN. Intra-DRN Ucn 2 also increased c-fos expression in labeled 5-HT neurons. Both of these effects of Ucn 2 were completely blocked by intra-DRN antisauvagine-30 (ASV-30), a relatively selective CRF2 antagonist. These data suggest that CRF, and CRF2 activation within the DRN affect 5-HT neurons in opponent fashion. Implications of these results for understanding the behavioral effects of CRF and other CRF-like ligands are discussed. (C) 2004 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The RT-PCR findings showed that HAEC expressed DAT mRNA with 100% homology to the human brain DAT. Saturation binding studies using [H-3]mazindol showed a high affinity DAT binding site with K-D and B-max values of 12.32 +/- 1.67 nM and 82.7 +/- 9.74 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Competition experiments showed that selective DAT blockers are potent displacers of [H-3]mazindol binding. The rank order of potency of the competing drugs is consistent with the pharmacology of the DAT. The present results provide compelling evidence that HAEC natively express the DAT mRNA and binding sites. More importantly, these results may suggest that HAEC is an appropriate human cell model for studying dopamine release and uptake processes and potential ligands at these sites.

In the current study we conducted positron emission tomography (PET) analysis in rats following injection of the adenoviral vector encoding the cDNA for the rat dopamine D-2 receptors (D2R) (AdCMV.DopD(2)R) into rat brain to provide a quantitative evaluation of D2R overexpression. Quantitative measurements as well as images by PET and ex vivo autoradiography demonstrated the significant increase of D2R binding of [C-11]raclopride, a specific D2R radioligand, in the AdCMV.DopD(2)R-injected rat striatum 2 or 3 days after vector injection. Longitudinal in vivo assessment of the gene expression by PET demonstrated decreased binding of [C-11]raclopride with time, which was in agreement with the observation in a cross-sectional autoradiographic study. The results of the current study demonstrate that PET can be used for longitudinal in vivo assessment of D2R expression mediated by adenoviral vector in rat brain. Synapse 43:195-200, 2002.

Like the three histamine receptors reported previously (H1, H2, and H3), the H4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor and is most closely related to the H3 receptor, sharing 58% identity in the transmembrane regions. The gene encoding the H4 receptor was discovered initially in a search of the GenBank databases as sequence fragments retrieved in a partially sequenced human genomic contig mapped to chromosome 18. These sequences were used to retrieve a partial cDNA clone and, in combination with genomic fragments, were used to determine the full-length open reading frame of 390 amino acids. Northern analysis revealed a 3.0-kb transcript in rat testis and intestine. Radioligand binding studies indicated that the H4 receptor has a unique pharmacology and binds [H-3] histamine (K-d = 44 nM) and [H-3] pyrilamine (K-d = 32 nM) and several psychoactive compounds (amitriptyline, chlorpromazine, cyproheptadine, mianserin) with moderate affinity (K-i range of 33-750 nM). Additionally, histamine induced a rapid internalization of HA-tagged H4 receptors in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells.

Further investigation of medicinal chemistry conditions yielded compound 29e (inhibiting tubulin polymerisation: IC50=4.8 mu M and anti-angiogenesis in Zebrafish: IC50=3.6 mu M) based on tubulin and zebrafish assays, which displayed noteworthily nanomolar potency against a variety of leukaemia cell lines (IC50= 0.09-1.22 mu M), especially K562 cells where apoptosis was induced. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, radioligand binding assay and cellular microtubule networks disruption results showed that 29e stably binds to the tubulin colchicine site. 29e significantly inhibited HUVEC tube formation, migration and invasion in vitro. Anti-angiogenesis in vivo was confirmed by zebrafish xenograft. 29e also prominently blocked K562 cell proliferation and metastasis in blood vessels and surrounding tissues of the zebrafish xenograft model. Together with promising physicochemical property and metabolic stability, 29e could be considered an effective anti-angiogenesis and -leukaemia drug candidate that binds to the tubulin colchicine site.

Considering the promising results from Radioligand Therapy (RLT) studies conducted at multiple centres, Lu-177-PSMA-617, is being considered for FDA approval. The organic ligand, PSMA-617, is therefore in great demand, but it is also an expensive pharmaceutical precursor. We demonstrate here a convenient synthetic protocol for PSMA-617, using a solution phase method. Both, linear and convergent synthetic strategies were explored to affirm that the later approach furnished the target in better yield. The protocol presented here involves the use of commercially and economically viable reagents together with flow reactor based metal catalyzed hydrogenation as vital step. Using the method portrayed, PSMA-617 with purity >99.5% was achieved, while, radiolabelling with Lu-177 afforded, Lu-177-PSMA-617 with radiochemical purity >98%, which is adequate for therapeutic applications. Lu-177-PSMA-617 prepared using the synthesized ligand showed parity in purity against that made from commercial equivalent.	[Kumar, K. S.

Using conformational constraints at position 6 of Angiotensin II to generate compounds with enhanced AT2R selectivity and proteolytic stability	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Angiotensin II; Constrained peptides; Receptor affinity; Receptor selectivity; Proteolytic stability	TYPE-2 RECEPTOR; ATTENUATES GROWTH; AMINO-ACIDS; PEPTIDES; RADIOLIGAND; AFFINITY; AGONIST; GRAFTS; AT(2)R; DESIGN	The Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS) plays a crucial role in numerous pathological conditions. Two of the critical RAS players, the angiotensin receptors AT1R and AT2R, possess differential functional profiles, although they share high sequence similarity. Although the main focus has been placed on AT1R, several epidemiological studies have evidenced that activation of AT2R could operate as a multimodal therapeutic target for different diseases. Thus, the development of selective AT2R ligands could have a high clinical potential for different therapeutic directions. Furthermore, they could serve as a powerful tool to interrogate the molecular mechanisms that are mediated by AT2R. Based on our recently established high affinity and AT2R selective compound [Y]6AII we developed several analogues through modifying aminoacids located at positions 6 and 7 with various conformationally constrained analogues to enhance both the selectivity and stability.

Preclinical Evaluation of the First Adenosine A<sub>1</sub> Receptor Partial Agonist Radioligand for Positron Emission Tomography Imaging	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO; A(2B) RECEPTOR; HUMAN BRAIN; PET; ADENOSINE-A1-RECEPTORS; NEUROTRANSMISSION; CAPADENOSON; DERIVATIVES; SELECTIVITY; INHIBITOR	Central adenosine A, receptor (A(1)R) is implicated in pain, sleep, substance use disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases, and is an important target for pharmaceutical development. Radiotracers for A(1)R positron emission tomography (PET) would enable measurement of the dynamic interaction of endogenous adenosine and A,R during the sleep-awake cycle. Although several human AIR PET tracers have been developed, most are xanthine-based antagonists that failed to demonstrate competitive binding against endogenous adenosine. Herein, we explored non-nucleoside (3,5-dicyanopyridine and 5-cyanopyrimidine) templates for developing an agonist A(1)R PET radiotracer. We synthesized novel analogues, including 2-amino-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-6-(2-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)ethyl)pyridine-3,5-dicarbonitrile (MMPD, 22b), a partial AIR agonist of sub-nanomolar affinity. [C-11]22b showed suitable blood brain barrier (BBB) permeability and test-retest reproducibility. Regional brain uptake of [C-11]22b was consistent with known brain A(1)R distribution and was blocked significantly by A(1)R but not A(2A)R ligands. [C-11]22b is the first BBB-permeable A(1)R partial agonist PET radiotracer with the promise of detecting endogenous adenosine fluctuations.

Amiloride 1 and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride 2 (HMA) supposedly bind in this sodium ion site and can influence orthosteric ligand binding. The availability of a high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the human adenosine A(2A) receptor (hA(2A)AR), in which the allosteric sodium ion site was elucidated, makes it an appropriate model receptor for investigating the allosteric site. In this study, we report the synthesis and evaluation of novel 5'-substituted amiloride derivatives as hA(2A)AR allosteric antagonists. The potency of the amiloride derivatives was assessed by their ability to displace orthosteric radioligand [H-3]4-(24(7-amino-2-(furan-2yl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]-[1,3,5]triazin-5-yl)amino)ethyl)phenol ([H-3]ZM-241,385) from both the wild-type and sodium ion site W246A mutant hA(2A)AR. 4-Ethoxyphenethyl-substituted amiloride 121 was found to be more potent than both amiloride and HMA, and the shift in potency between the wild-type and mutated receptor confirmed its likely binding to the sodium ion site.

Decreased <i>in vivo</i> α2 adrenoceptor binding in the Flinders Sensitive Line rat model of depression	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Depression; Flinders sensitive line; Noradrenaline; Positron emission tomography; Yohimbine	ANIMAL-MODEL; REUPTAKE INHIBITORS; AGONIST BINDING; DISORDERS; YOHIMBINE; ANXIETY; BRAIN; MOOD; NOREPINEPHRINE; NORADRENALINE	Depression is a debilitating heterogenous disorder and the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Alterations in monoaminergic neurotransmission, including noradrenergic, have been implicated in the etiology of depression. Although depression is difficult to model in animals, the availability of animal models with face, predictive and construct validity permits more in-depth investigations resulting in a greater understanding of the disease. We investigated the role of noradrenaline (NA) and alpha 2 adrenoceptors in vivo in a genetic model of depression, the Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rat. We determined baseline differences in NA receptor volume of distribution to alpha 2 adrenoceptors in FSL, in comparison with two routinely used controls, Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and the carbon-11 labeled radioligand yohimbine. We demonstrate a 42-47% reduction in the binding of the tracer in the cortex, striatum, cerebellum, thalamus and pons of FSL rats compared to the two control groups. Our results suggest that the behavioral deficits expressed in the FSL depression model are associated with functional over-activity of the NA system. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The piperidine moiety bearing monomethyl or geminal dimethyl groups was employed as a probe to explore a-subtype affinities and selectivities by radioligand binding assays at sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors and the Delta(8)-Delta(7) sterol isomerase (SI) site. 4-Methyl derivative 31 was the most potent sigma(1) ligand (K-i = 0.030 nM) with a good selectivity profile (597-fold and 268-fold relative to sigma(2) receptor and SI site, respectively), whereas 3,3-dimethyl derivative 26 (K-i = 0.35 nM) was the most selective (680-fold) relative to the sigma(2) receptor. Both compounds can be proposed as tools for PET experiments. Furthermore, the naphthalene compounds 26, 28, 31, and 33 demonstrated antiproliferative activity in rat C6 glioma cells (EC50 = 15.0 mu M for 33), revealing a putative a, antagonist activity and opening a useful perspective in tumor research and therapy.

We assessed brain 5-HT1A receptor binding potential directly using the specific radioligand [C-11]WAY-100635 and positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: We selected 10 patients from a tertiary referral clinic who fulfilled the CDC consensus criteria for CFS. To assemble a homogenous group and avoid confounding effects, we enrolled only subjects who were completely medication-free and did not have current comorbid psychiatric illness. We also scanned 10 healthy control subjects. Results. There was a widespread reduction in 5-HT1A receptor binding potential in CFS relative to control subjects. This was particularly marked in the hippocampus bilaterally, where a 23% reduction was observed. Conclusions. There is evidence of decreased 5-HT1A receptor number or affinity in CFS. This may be a primary feat re of CFS, related to the underlying pathophysiology, or a finding secondary to other processes, such as previous depression, other biological changes or the behavioral consequences of CFS.

The authors examined the effects of being a spousal caregiver of a patient with Alzheimer disease (AD) on the lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenergic receptor Methods: One hundred and six women and men, spousal caregivers and non-caregivers, participated (mean age: 71.5 years). Caregivers were classified as either vulnerable or non-vulnerable on the basis of the amount of care required by the patient relative to the amount of respite the caregiver received during the previous 6 months. beta(2)-adrenergic receptor sensitivity (cyclic-AMP response to isoproterenol stimulation) and density (radioligand binding) were determined by use of whole lymphocytes. Results: Vulnerable caregivers had reduced beta(2)-adrenergic receptor sensitivity and density when compared with their non-vulnerable counterparts or with non-caregivers. Conclusion: The findings indicate that for more vulnerable caregivers, the stress of caregiving leads to a loss of lymphocyte beta(2)-adrenergic receptors.

J	Logan, J				Logan, J			A review of graphical methods for tracer studies and strategies to reduce bias	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN TRANSFER CONSTANTS; REVERSIBLE RADIOLIGAND BINDING; C-11 RACLOPRIDE BINDING; TIME UPTAKE DATA; PARAMETRIC IMAGES; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTERS; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE; BLOOD-FLOW	Graphical techniques provide simple methods for the analysis of data from tracer studies. They provide considerable ease of computation compared to the optimization of individual model parameters in the solution of the differential equations generally used to describe the binding of tracers. The theoretical work of Patlak which was applied to irreversible tracers formed the basis for extensions of graphical techniques to reversibly binding tracers. The advantage of graphical methods is that they are not dependent upon a particular model structure but provide a measure of tracer binding that can be interpreted in terms of a model structure if desired. They provide a visual way to distinguish the type of binding whether reversible or irreversible in the initial studies of new ligands. Conditions under which the graphical techniques can be applied are considered as well as problems encountered with slow binding components. One problem in the use of these methods particularly the method for reversible tracers is the bias generated due to the presence of statistical noise. Some recently proposed techniques for reducing the noise are considered. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is an analogue of the insect steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone. Previous ecdysteroid QSAR and molecular modelling studies predicted that the cavity of the ligand binding domain of the ecdysteroid receptor would possess space in the vicinity of C-11/C-12 of the ecdysteroid. We report the regioselective synthesis of a series of turkesterone 11 alpha-acyl derivatives in order to explore this possibility. The structures of the analogues have been unambiguously determined by spectroscopic means (NMR and low-resolution mass spectrometry). Purity was verified by HPLC. Biological activities have been determined in Drosophila melanogaster B-II cell-based bioassay for ecdysteroid agonists and in an in vitro radioligand-displacement assay using bacterially-expressed D. melanogaster EcR/USP receptor proteins. The 11 alpha-acyl derivatives do retain a significant amount of biological activity relative to the parent ecdysteroid. Further, although activity initially drops with the extension of the acyl chain length (C-2 to C-4), it then increases (C-6 to C-10), before decreasing again (C-14 and C-20). The implications of these findings for the interaction of ecdysteroids with the ecdysteroid receptor and potential applications in the generation of affinity-labelled and fluorescently-tagged ecdysteroids are discussed.

The expression plasmids were constructed in which the CB2 gene is under the control of the highly inducible promoter of P. pastoris alcohol oxidase 1 gene. A c-myc epitope and a hexahistidine tag were introduced at the C-terminal of the CB2 to permit easy detection and purification. In membrane preparations of CB2 gene transformed yeast cells, Western blot analysis detected the expression of CB2 proteins. Radioligand binding assays demonstrated that the CB2 receptors expressed in P. pastoris have a pharmacological profile similar to that of the receptors expressed in mammalian systems. Furthermore, the epitope-tagged receptor was purified by metal chelating chromatography and the purified CB2 preparations were subjected to digestion by trypsin. MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides extracted from tryptic digestions detected 14 peptide fragments derived from the CB2 receptor. ESI mass spectrometry was used to sequence one of these peptide fragments, thus, further confirming the identity of the purified receptor. In conclusion, these data demonstrated for the first time that epitope-tagged, functional CB2 cannabinoid receptor can be expressed in P. pastoris for purification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

Competition binding experiments showed that dihydroergosine is a potent displacer of (H-3)8-OH-DPAT binding at brain 5-HT1A receptors of both species. Scatchard analysis of (H-3)8-OH-DPAT binding to rat hippocampal membranes in the presence of dihydroergosine revealed that this ergot compound markedly decreases the number and the affinity of hippocampal (H-3)8-OH-DPAT labelled binding sites. Preincubation of rat hippocampal membranes for 180 min with dihydroergosine (2 nmol dm(-3)) completely prevented the binding of (H-3)8-OH-DPAT (2 nmol dm(-3)). The data suggest that dihydroergosine is approximately as potent a ligand as 8-OH-DPAT for the hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors from human and rat brains, although their kinetics of association and dissociation are apparently different.

The K-d values of the PTH/PTHrP receptor in both tissues were decreased at 10 and 24 wk in female birds, whereas the values were increased at 24 wk in male birds. The B-max values of the PTH/PTHrP receptor in both tissues were decreased at 10 wk and returned to baseline at 24 wk in female birds. The values were increased at 24 wk in male birds. The K-d and B-max values of CT receptors in the both tissues were constant during the experimental period in female and male birds. The results suggest that the binding properties of PTH/PTHrP receptor and of CT receptor may be influenced by gonadal hormones relating to sexual maturation.

For this purpose, subchronic 7-day-d-amphetamine pretreatment was combined with acute amphetamine, phencyclidine or LSD challenge. Acute application of psychotomimetics affected only striatal and accumbens but not nigral and olfactory dopamine receptor binding after 40 min, while subchronic amphetamine expressed no effect, as revealed by two-way ANOVA. Post-hoc statistical analysis showed that only striatal and accumbens[H-3]SCH 23390 binding decrease (10-12%) following phencyclidine and striatal [H-3]spiperone binding increase (11%) after acute amphetamine were significant. It is assumed that such moderate dopamine receptor binding changes probably reflect the fast receptor regulation responses without important influence on a proposed drug-induced dopaminergic overactivity. The registered alterations of D-1 receptor binding after phencyclidine are suggested to be capable to modify the activity of some other neural pathways in the basal ganglia and thus participate in a psychotic-like behaviour.

Here, we report the occurrence of the ciguatera poisoning-causative dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus balechii in the Philippines. Toxin production and chemical diversity of secondary metabolites in G. balechii GtoxSAM092414, G. balechii Gtox112513, and the recently reported Gambierdiscus carpenteri Gam1BOL080513 were assessed using targeted and untargeted UPLC-MS/MS analysis and radioligand receptor-binding assay (RBA). 44-methylgambierone was produced by all three strains, albeit with different levels based on RBA and UPLC-HRMS/MS analysis. The fatty acid composition was similar in all strains, while subtle differences in monosaccharide content were observed, related to the collection site rather than the species. Molecular networking using the GNPS database identified 45 clusters belonging to at least ten compound classes, with terpene glycosides, carbohydrate conjugates, polyketides, and macrolides as major convergence points. Species-specific peptides and polyhydroxylated compounds were identified in G. balechii GtoxSAM092414 and G. carpenteri Gam1BOL080513, respectively. These provide a glimpse of the uncharacterized biosynthetic potential of benthic dinoflagellates and highlight the intricate and prolific machinery for secondary metabolites production in these organisms.

The compounds were tested with radioligand binding studies showing, in some cases, a low nanomolar A(1) adenosine receptor affinity and a very good selectivity versus the other adenosine receptor subtypes. Functional assays at human adenosine receptors and at a mouse ileum tissue preparation clearly demonstrate the antagonist profile of these molecules, with inhibitory potency at nanomolar level. A molecular modeling study, consisting in docking analysis at the recently reported A(1) adenosine receptor crystal structure, was performed for the interpretation of the obtained pharmacological results. The N-6-cyclopentyl-9-methyl-8-phenyladenine (17), resulting the most active derivative of the series (K-i = 2.8 nM and IC50 = 14 nM), was also very efficacious in counteracting the effect of the agonist CCPA on mouse ileum contractility. This new compound represents a tool for the development of new agents for the treatment of intestinal diseases as constipation and postoperative ileus. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicts volume changes with neurodegeneration and inflammation, as well as abnormalities in functional and structural connectivity. MRI arterial spin labeling allows for the quantification of regional cerebral blood flow, characteristically altered in Alzheimer's disease, diffuse Lewy-body disease, and the frontotemporal dementias. Positron emission tomography allows for the determination of regional metabolism, with similar abnormalities as flow, and for the measurement of beta-amyloid and abnormal tau deposition in the brain, as well as regional inflammation. These instruments allow for the quantification in vivo of most of the pathologic features observed in disorders causing dementia. Importantly, they allow for the longitudinal study of these abnormalities, having revealed, for instance, that the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain can antecede by decades the onset of dementia. Thus, a therapeutic window has been opened and the efficacy of immunotherapies directed at removing beta-amyloid from the brain of asymptomatic individuals is currently being tested. Tau and inflammation imaging, still in their infancy, combined with genomics, should provide powerful insights into these disorders and facilitate their treatment.

Therefore, sigma(2) receptor is an intriguing target for tumor diagnosis and treatment despite the fact that that it has not yet been cloned. One of the last attempts to characterize sigma(2) receptors led to identify it as the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1). Although still controversial, such identity appears to have been accepted. We the aim of contributing to solve this controversy, in this work we stably silenced or overexpressed PGRMC1 protein in human MCF7 adenocarcinoma cells. Western blotting analyses were performed to quantify the presence of PGRMC1 protein on each of the three MCF7 cell lines variants, while scatchard analyses with radioligand were performed in order to determine the expression of the sigma(2) receptors. In order to correlate the antiproliferative effect of sigma(2) receptor agonist with PGRMC1 density, some sigma(2) ligands were administered to each of the three MCF7 cells variants. The results suggested that PGRMC1 and sigma(2) receptors are two different molecular entities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

At clinically relevant bactericidal doses, however, the psychotropic drugs produce undesirable side effects in addition to their neuroleptic properties. This study aimed to evaluate rationally designed novel phenothiazines as antimycobacterial drug candidates. Remodelling of psychotropic drugs by substitution of characteristic N-alkylamine side chains, important for CNS activity, with N-alkylsulphonates gave novel drug candidates, which were then tested for post-synaptic receptor binding affinity in a radioligand displacement assay. The bactericidal activities were screened using green fluorescent protein (GFP) microplate assays, and the efficacy of intracellular bacillus killing was evaluated by cfu enumeration. Of the four selected phenothiazine derivatives (PTZ3, PTZ4, PTZ31 and PTZ32) tested, PTZ31 displayed marginal serotonergic activity. The remaining three derivatives did not exhibit dopamine or serotonin receptor binding activity. In vitro results showed significant growth inhibition of virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis with MICs of 12.5-25 mg/L. None of the phenothiazine derivatives displayed cytotoxicity in infected primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Moreover, the phenothiazines showed significant antimycobacterial activity of between 40% and 60% against intracellular (ex vivo) M. tuberculosis. We demonstrate that structural modification of the phenothiazine core is possible in a manner that does not affect the ability of the phenothiazine derivatives to inhibit M. tuberculosis, but that abolishes undesirable dopamine and serotonin receptor binding.

Radiolabeling of [C-11]1-4 was achieved by alkylation of their corresponding desmethyl precursors with [C-11]CH3I. Preliminary biodistribution evaluation in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated that [11C] 1 and [C-11]2 had high striatal accumulation (at peak time) for [C-11]1 and [C-11]2 were 6.0-fold and 4.5-fold at 60 min, respectively. Following MP-10 pretreatment, striatal uptake in rats of [C-11]1 and [C-11]2 was reduced, suggesting that the tracers bind specifically to PDE10A. MicroPET studies of [C-11]1 and [C-11]2 in nonhuman primates (NHP) also showed good tracer retention in the striatum with rapid clearance from non-target brain regions. Striatal uptake (SUV) of [C-11]1 reached 1.8 at 30 min with a 3.5-fold striatum: cerebellum ratio. In addition, HPLC analysis of solvent extracts from NHP plasma samples suggested that [C-11]1 had a very favorable metabolic stability. Our preclinical investigations suggest that [C-11]1 is a promising candidate for quantification of PDE10A in vivo using PET. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, PSMP was found to possess chemotactic ability toward monocytes and lymphocytes, and its functional receptor was identified as CCR2B. PSMP was identified as a chemoattractant protein from a PBMC chemoattractant platform screen that we established. The mature secreted PSMP was able to chemoattract human peripheral blood monocytes, PBLs, and CCR2B-expressing THP-1 cells, but not peripheral blood neutrophils, even though it does not contain the classical structure of chemokines. CCR2B was identified as one receptor for PSMP-mediated chemotaxis by screening HEK293 cells that transiently expressed classical chemokine receptors; results obtained from the chemotaxis, calcium flux, receptor internalization, and radioligand-binding assays all confirmed this finding. To further identify the major function of PSMP, we analyzed its expression profile in tissues. PSMP is highly expressed in benign prostatic hyperplasia and in some prostate cancers, and can also be detected in breast tumor tissue. In response to PSMP stimulation, phosphorylated ERK levels downstream of CCR2B signaling were upregulated in the PC3 cell line. Taken together, our data collectively suggest that PSMP is a chemoattractant protein acting as a novel CCR2 ligand that may influence inflammation and cancer development.

Novel 1-(1-benzyl-1<i>H</i>-indol-3-yl)-<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-trimethylmethanaminium iodides are competitive antagonists for the human α4β2 and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	MEDCHEMCOMM			English	Article							BINDING; DISCOVERY; LIGANDS; SITES	This work presents the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization of a series of novel 1-(1-benzyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-N,N,N-trimethylmethanaminium iodide derivatives at the human (h) alpha 7 and alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). The inhibitory activity of the compounds was determined by Ca2+ influx assays on cells expressing either the h alpha 7 or h alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR subtype. To determine whether the observed inhibitory activity is mediated by a competitive or non-competitive mechanism, additional radioligand binding assays were performed using [H-3]methyllycaconitine, [H-3]cytisine, and [H-3]imipramine. The results established that the compounds inhibit the nAChRs by a competitive mechanism and that the potencies are higher for the h alpha 7 nAChR compared to that for the h alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. Substitutions with oxygenated functional groups on the benzene ring increase the receptor selectivity. In particular, the hydroxyl derivatives 4b and 4c present the highest selectivity for the h alpha 7 nAChR subtype. Molecular docking results indicate that the hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group at alpha 7-Gln116, but not at beta 2-Phe115, supporting the observed receptor selectivity at the molecular level.

However, there is still little knowledge about GPCR structure and dynamics since high-level expression and characterization of active GPCRs in vitro is extremely complicated. Here, we describe the recombinant expression and functional folding of the human Y-2 receptor from inclusion bodies of E. coli cultures. Milligram protein quantities were produced using high density fermentation and isolated in a single step purification with a yield of over 20 mg/L culture. Extensive studies were carried out on in vitro refolding and stabilization of the isolated receptor in detergent solution. The specific binding of the ligand, the 36 residue neuropeptide Y (NPY), to the recombinant Y2 receptors in micellar form was shown by several radioligand affinity assays. In competition experiments, an IC50 value in low nanomolar range could be determined. Further, a K-D value of 1.9 nM was determined from a saturation assay, where NPY was titrated to the recombinant Y-2 receptors. (C) 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Visualization of specific receptor subtypes by positron emission tomography (PET) has potential to assist with diagnosis of such neurodegenerative diseases and with design of suitable therapeutic approaches. The goal of our study was to evaluate in vivo the potential of 18 F[abetted (+)- and (-)-norchloro-ftuoro-homoepibatidine ([F-18]NCFHEB) in comparison to 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 as PET tracers. In the brains of NMRI mice, highest levels of radioactivity were detected at 20 min post-injection of (+)-[F-18]NCFHEB, (-)-[F-18]NCFHEB, and 2-F-[F-18]-A-85380 (7.45, 5.60, and 3.2% ID/g tissue, respectively). No marked pharmacological adverse effects were observed at 25 mu g NCFHEB/kg.

Quantitative functional parameters are usually derived by curve fitting the dynamic data of a functional imaging study. However, the intrinsic high level of noise and low signal to noise ratio can lead to instability in the parameter estimation and give rise to non-physiological parameter estimates. Clustering techniques have been applied to improve signal to noise ratio and the reliability of parametric image generation, but these may enhance partial volume effects (PVE) and result in biased estimates for small structures. Therefore, a systematic study was performed using computer simulations of SPECT data and the generalized linear least square algorithm (GLLS) to evaluate the ability of three proposed enhanced methods and a clustering-aided method to improve the reliability of parametric image generation. The results demonstrate that clustering with sufficient cluster numbers ameliorated PVE and provided noise-insensitive parameter estimates. The enhanced GLLS method with a prior volume of distribution and bootstrap Monte Carlo resampling improved the reliability of the curve fitting, and is thus suitable for application to noisy SPECT data.

However, it suffers from appreciable losses by incomplete reduction giving [C-11]formate. We show that samarium diiodide (SmI2) can be used to improve the yield of [C-11]methanol by its ability to efficiently reduce [C-11]formate to [C-11]methanol. This can be done either by making [C-11]formate intentionally and treating it with SmI2 or by treating the LiAlH4-reduced [C-11]CO2 with SmI2. In the latter approach, sodium thiosulphate has a similar effect as SmI2. Hydriodic acid was also shown to exert some reducing action on [C-11]formate too. [C-11]Carbonate is reduced to a small extent by SmI2 under the mild conditions employed. In contrast to the very easy [C-11]formate reduction, SmI2 had little effect on [C-11]acetate and practically no [C-11]ethanol could be produced. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Addition of increasing concentration of I-125-apoC III to HepG2 cells revealed a saturable binding to HepG2 cells with a K-d of (9.53 +/- 1.03) x 10(-9) mol/L. The maximum specific binding capacity (B-max) was (3.28 +/- 0.31) mug/g. The results showed that there were specific, saturable, and reversible binding site of apoC III on HepG2 cells, and it was identified that HepG2 cell line was a useful model for the study of human hepatic apoC III receptor. In the following, the effects of insulin and glucagon on apoC III receptr of HepG2 cells were examined respectively. The results showed that insulin had no effect on the K-d value, but significantly increased the B-max value of apoC III receptor; and glucagon had no effect on the B-max, but decreased the affinity constant of apoC III receptor. These results indicated that human hepatic apoC III receptor was possibliy under the different regulations of insulin and glucagon.

However, little is known about the physiological roles of this ligand-receptor pairing. In the present study we investigated the pharmacology of several apelin analogues at the human recombinant APJ receptor using radioligand binding and functional assays. This has led to the identification of key residues in the apelin peptide required for functional potency and binding affinity through structure-activity studies. In particular, we have identified that replacement of leucine in position 5, or arginine in position 2 and 4 of the C -terminal apelin peptide, apelin-13, resulted in significant changes in pharmacology. We also investigated the detailed localization of pre-proapelin and APJ receptor mRNA in a wide range of human, rat and mouse tissues using quantitative RT-PCR, and carried out a detailed immunohistochemical study of the distribution of the APJ receptor in rat brain and spinal cord. Interestingly, the APJ receptor was not only co-localized in white matter with GFAP in the spinal cord, but was also clearly localized on neurones in the brain, suggesting that this receptor and its peptide may be involved in a wide range of biological process yet to be determined.

However, the mechanism of that augmentation remains to be elucidated. In this study, we examined the role of muscarinic receptor-mediated signalling in the potentiation of ANP-induced relaxation by lidocaine. Lidocaine (100 muM) augmented the relaxant responses to ANP in methacholine (0.3 muM)-contracted bovine tracheal smooth muscle but had no effect on the relaxant effects of ANP in preparations contracted with 100 muM histamine. Treatment of tracheal preparations with methoctramine (0.03 muM), an M-2 muscarinic receptor antagonist, enhanced ANP-induced relaxation and this treatment abolished the synergistic action of lidocaine on ANP. In radioligand-binding experiments, lidocaine concentration dependently displaced the specific binding of [H-3]-N-methyl scopolamine to cloned human M-2 and M-3 muscarinic receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that lidocaine acts as an M-2 muscarinic receptor antagonist, thereby potentiating the relaxant responses to ANP in the bovine tracheal smooth muscle contracted with muscarinic receptor agonists.

The aim of this pilot study was to assess tumor visualization using [Ga-68]RM2 PET/CT in patients with pre-treated ER-positive BC and suspected metastases. Eight female patients with initial ER-positive, pre-treated BC were included in this retrospective study. Strong RM2 binding was found in all metastatic lesions of six patients, whereas two patients were rated RM2-negative. Our data suggest that RM2 binding is maintained in the majority of patients with advanced disease stage of pre-treated ER-positive BC. Thus, [Ga-68]RM2 PET/CT could support treatment decision in these patients, radiotherapy planning in oligometastatic patients or selection of patients for RM2 radioligand therapy. Background: Positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) using the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor antagonist [Ga-68]RM2 has shown to be a promising imaging method for primary breast cancer (BC) with positive estrogen receptor (ER) status. This study assessed tumor visualization by [Ga-68]RM2 PET/CT in patients with pre-treated ER-positive BC and suspected metastases. Methods: This retrospective pilot study included eight female patients with initial ER-positive, pre-treated BC who underwent [Ga-68]RM2 PET/CT. Most of these patients (seven out of eight; 88%) were still being treated with or had received endocrine therapy. [Ga-68]RM2 PET/CTs were visually analyzed by two nuclear medicine specialists in consensus. Tumor manifestations were rated qualitatively (i.e., RM2-positive or RM2-negative) and quantitatively using the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax). SUVmax values were compared between the two subgroups (RM2-positive vs. RM2-negative). Results: Strong RM2 binding was found in all metastatic lesions of six patients (75%), whereas tracer uptake in all metastases of two patients (25%) was rated negative. Mean SUVmax of RM2-positive metastases with the highest SUVmax per patient (in lymph node and bone metastases; 15.8 +/- 15.1 range: 3.7-47.8) was higher than mean SUVmax of the RM2-negative metastases with the highest SUVmax per patient (in bone metastases; 1.6 +/- 0.1, range 1.5-1.7). Conclusions: Our data suggest that RM2 binding is maintained in the majority of patients with advanced disease stage of pre-treated ER-positive BC. Thus, [Ga-68]RM2 PET/CT could support treatment decision in these patients, radiotherapy planning in oligometastatic patients or selection of patients for RM2 radioligand therapy. Further studies with larger patient cohorts are warranted to confirm these findings.

There are several radionuclide techniques for imaging PCa skeletal metastases. We aimed to compare the lesion detection rate of [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA-zoledronate ([Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL)) PET/CT, and [Tc-99m]Tc-MDP bone scan in the assessment of bone metastases in patients with advanced PCa. Methods We prospectively recruited two cohorts of patients (staging and re-staging cohorts) with advanced prostate cancer. The staging cohort was treatment-naive PCa patients who showed skeletal metastases on bone scan. These patients were subsequently imaged with [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL) PET/CT. Re-staging cohort was patients who were previously treated with PSMA-based radioligand therapy and were experiencing PSA progression. The re-staging cohort was imaged with [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL) PET/CT. We performed a per-patient and per-lesion analysis of skeletal metastases in both cohorts and made a comparison between scan findings. Results Eighteen patients were included with a median age of 68 years (range = 48-80) and a median Gleason score of 8. There were ten patients in the staging cohort with a median PSA of 119.26 ng/mL (range = 4.63-18,948.00) and eight patients in the re-staging cohort with a median PSA of 48.56 ng/mL (range = 6.51-3175.00). In the staging cohort, skeletal metastases detected by [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL) PET/CT, and bone scan were 322, 288, and 261, respectively, p = 0.578. In the re-staging cohort, [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL) PET/CT detected 152 and 191 skeletal metastases, respectively, p = 0.529. In two patients with negative [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT findings, [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL) detected one skeletal metastasis in one patient and 12 skeletal metastases in the other. Conclusion In patients with advanced prostate cancer, [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT may detect more lesions than [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL) PET/CT and [Tc-99m]Tc-MDP bone scan for the staging of skeletal metastases. In patients who experience PSA progression on PSMA-based radioligand therapy, [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA PET/CT is a more suitable imaging modality for the detection of skeletal lesions not expressing PSMA. In the setting of re-staging, [Ga-68]Ga-NODAGA(ZOL) PET/CT may detect more lesions than [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT.	[Lawal, Ismaheel O.; Mokoala, Kgomotso M.

They show that the bivalent ligands promote endosomal trafficking of D3R, suggesting a potential role for dimerization in vivo. Bivalent ligands are composed of two pharmacophores connected by a spacer of variable size. These ligands are able to simultaneously recognize two binding sites, for example in a G protein-coupled receptor heterodimer, resulting in enhanced binding affinity. Taking advantage of previously described heterobivalent dopamine-neurotensin receptor ligands, we demonstrate specific interactions between dopamine D3 (D3R) and neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1), two receptors with expression in overlapping brain areas that are associated with neuropsychiatric diseases and addiction. Bivalent ligand binding to D3R-NTSR1 dimers results in picomolar binding affinity and high selectivity compared to the binding to monomeric receptors. Specificity of the ligands for the D3R-NTSR1 receptor pair over D2R-NTSR1 dimers can be achieved by a careful choice of the linker length. Bivalent ligands enhance and stabilize the receptor-receptor interaction leading to NTSR1-controlled internalization of D3R into endosomes via recruitment of beta-arrestin, highlighting a potential mechanism for dimer-specific receptor trafficking and signalling.

To our knowledge, no study has determined the effect of denoising on the ability to detect differences in binding at the voxel level using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM). Methods In the present study, groups of subject-images with a 10%- and 20%-difference in binding of [I-123]iomazenil (IMZ) were simulated. They were denoised with Factor Analysis (FA). Parametric images of binding potential (BPND) were produced with the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the Logan non-invasive graphical analysis (LNIGA) and analyzed using SPM to detect group differences. FA was also applied to [I-123]IMZ and [C-11] flumazenil (FMZ) clinical images (n = 4) and the variance of BPND was evaluated. Results Estimations from FA-denoised simulated images provided a more favorable bias-precision profile in SRTM and LNIGA quantification. Simulated differences were detected in a higher number of voxels when denoised simulated images were used for voxel-wise estimations, compared to quantification on raw simulated images. Variability of voxel-wise binding estimations on denoised clinical SPECT and PET images was also significantly diminished. Conclusion In conclusion, noise removal from dynamic brain SPECT and PET images may optimize voxel-wise BPND estimations and detection of biological differences using SPM.

Quantification of -AR density may have clinical implications in terms of assessing disease severity and identifying patients who could potentially benefit from beta-blocker therapy. Classical methods for -AR quantification are based on labor-intensive and time-consuming radioligand binding assays. Here, we report optimization of a flow cytometry-based method utilizing a biotinylated -AR ligand alprenolol as a probe and use of this method to quantify relative receptor expression in healthy controls (HC). Quantum MESF beads were used for quantification in absolute fluorescence units. The probe was chemically modified by adding a spacer moiety between biotin and alprenolol to stabilize receptor binding, thus preventing binding decay. Testing of three different standard cell fixation and permeabilization methods (formaldehyde fixation and saponin, Tween-20, or Triton-X 100 permeabilization) showed that the formaldehyde/Triton-X 100 method yielded the best results. -AR expression was significantly higher in granulocytes compared to mononuclear cells. These data show that flow cytometric quantification of relative -AR expression in circulating leukocytes is a suitable technology for large-scale clinical application.

Imaging of biochemically recurrent prostate cancer has been established as a widely accepted clinical indication for PSMA ligand PET/CT in many parts of the world because of the results of multiple, primarily retrospective, studies that indicate superior detection efficacy compared with standard-of-care imaging. For high-risk primary prostate cancer, evidence is growing that this modality significantly aids in the detection of otherwise occult nodal and bone metastases. For both clinical indications in recurrent as well as in primary prostate cancer, preliminary data demonstrate a substantial impact on clinical management. Emerging data imply that intraprostatic tumor localization, therapy stratification, and treatment monitoring of advanced disease in specific clinical situations might become future indications. Current criteria for image reporting of PSMA ligand PET are evolving given the expanding body of literature on physiologic and pathologic uptake patterns and pitfalls. This article intends to give an educational overview on the current status of PSMA ligand PET imaging, including imaging procedure and interpretation, clinical indications, diagnostic potential, and impact on treatment planning.

Dysfunction of the glutamate system has been implicated in trauma and stress psychopathology, resulting in a growing interest in modulation of the glutamate system for the treatment of PTSD. Specifically, the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) represents a promising treatment target. We used [F-18]FPEB, a radioligand that binds to the mGluR5, and positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify in vivo mGluR5 availability in human PTSD vs. healthy control (HCs) subjects. In an independent sample of human postmortem tissue, we investigated expression of proteins that have a functional relationship with mGluR5 and glucocorticoids in PTSD. We observed significantly higher cortical mGluR5 availability in PTSD in vivo and positive correlations between mGluR5 availability and avoidance symptoms. In the postmortem sample, we observed up-regulation of SHANK1, a protein that anchors mGluR5 to the cell surface, as well as decreased expression of FKBP5, implicating aberrant glucocorticoid functioning in PTSD. Results of this study provide insight into molecular mechanisms underlying PTSD and suggest that mGluR5 may be a promising target for mechanism-based treatments aimed at mitigating this disorder.

Levofloxacin, a 3rd generation fluoroquinolone derivative, labeled with (99)mTc; developed freeze dried kits and utilized as potential infection imaging agents. Kits are produced with higher labeling efficiency and great stability than levofloxacin kits previously produced which have high colloidal content and need HCl as well as heating for their development. Whilst we have employed a simple method in which kits are developed at room temperature without HCl and heating with low colloidal content. After optimization of reaction conditions, maximum labeling efficiency was obtained when 1.0 mg levofloxacin, 100 mu g SnCl2 and 300 mu g D-penicillamine were labeled with 10 mCi sodium pertechnetate. Preclinical assessments of radiolabeled antibiotic were performed including purity, stability, and pharmacokinetic investigations in animals. Kits were highly stable at room temperature and in serum at 37 degrees C for 6 h. In vivo studies showed excellent uptake of activity at infection site by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, and Escherichia coli). The target to non-target ratios indicated that this kit of levofloxacin may be used for infection diagnosis.

Ever since the discovery of a naturally occurring HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA) stimulated the recent development of suberoylanilide (SAHA, Zolinza (R)), HDAC has become an important molecular target for drug development. This has created the need to develop specific in vivo radioligands to study epigenetic regulation and HDAC engagement for drug development for diseases including cancer and disorders. 6-([F-18]Fluoroacetamido)-1-hexanoicanilide ([F-18]FAHA) was recently developed as a HDAC substrate and shows moderate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and specific signal (by metabolic trapping/or deacetylation) but rapid metabolism. Here, we report the radiosynthesis of two carbon-11 labeled candidate radiotracers (substrate-and inhibitor-based radioligand) for HDAC and their evaluation in non-human primate brain. PET studies showed very low brain uptake and rapid metabolism of both labeled compounds but revealed a surprising enhancement of brain penetration by F for H substitution when comparing one of these to [F-18]FAHA. Further structural refinement is needed for the development of brain-penetrant, metabolically stable HDAC radiotracers and to understand the role of fluorine substitution on brain penetration.

Effects of Phenazepam on the Behavior of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c Mice in the Open Field Test after Naloxone Pretreatment	BULLETIN OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						inbred mice; phenazepam; naloxone; anxiolytic effect; benzodiazepine binding	BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTOR; OPIOID SYSTEM; INBRED MICE; ANXIETY; STRESS	We studied the effects of phenazepam (0.075 mg/kg) after pretreatment (5 minutes before) with naloxone (10 mg/kg) on open-field behavior of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. In ex vivo experiments, we studied the effects of naloxone (1 and 10 mg/kg) on receptor binding of [H-3]-fl unitrazepam by membranes of brain fraction (P1+P2) of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice. It was shown that naloxone increased motor activity in the open field in BALB/c mice and decreased this parameter in C57Bl/6 mice. During combined treatment, naloxone potentiated the activating effects of phenazepam on the open-field behavior of BALB/c mice and slightly increased the sedative effect of this drug in C57Bl/6 mice. Naloxone stimulated reception of [H-3]-fl unitrazepam in BALB/c mice and slightly increased radioligand binding in C57Bl/6 mice. These data attest to enhanced reception in benzodiazepine site of GABA(A)-receptor under conditions of opioid receptor blockade, the presence of anxiolytic or sedative (depending on the phenotype of the response to emotional stress) effect of naloxone, and co-directed effects of naloxone and benzodiazepine tranquilizer on open-field behavior of C57Bl/6 and BALB/c mice.

In vivo distribution of [F-18]FITM in brains was evaluated by PET scans with or without the mGluR1-selective antagonist (JNJ16259685). Kinetic parameters of monkey PET data were obtained using the two-tissue compartment model with arterial blood sampling. In PET studies in rat and monkey brains, the highest uptake of radioactivity was in the cerebellum, followed by moderate uptake in the thalamus, hippocampus and striatum. The lowest uptake of radioactivity was detected in the pons. These uptakes in all brain regions were dramatically decreased by pre-administration of JNJ16259685. In kinetic analysis of monkey PET, the highest volume of distribution (V (T) ) was detected in the cerebellum (V (T) = 11.5). [F-18]FITM has an excellent profile as a PET ligand for mGluR1 imaging. PET with [F-18]FITM may prove useful for determining the regional distribution and density of mGluR1 and the mGluR1 occupancy of drugs in human brains.

[F-18]8 exhibits a high affinity to A beta and suitable brain uptake kinetics combined with a high metabolic stability in the brain. In a double transgenic APP/PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, we demonstrated a specific uptake of [F-18]8 in A beta-containing telencephalic brain regions. The specific binding of [F-18]8 to A beta was confirmed by regional brain biodistribution and autoradiography and correlated to immunohistochemistry staining. Analysis of brain sections of APP/PS1 mouse injected with a cocktail of [F-18]8 and reference compound [H-3]PiB revealed that the two tracers bind to A beta plaques in the brain of mouse in a comparable binding pattern. [F-18]8 represents the first high-contrast PET imaging agent for detection of A beta plaques in transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and holds promise for transfer to a clinical evaluation.

Modifying the conserved <i>C</i>-terminal tyrosine of the peptide hormone PYY3-36 to improve Y2 receptor selectivity	JOURNAL OF PEPTIDE SCIENCE			English	Article						PYY; PYY3-36; Y2 receptor agonist; gut hormone; tyrosine analogs; obesity	INHIBITS FOOD-INTAKE; GASTRIC-ACID-SECRETION; PANCREATIC-POLYPEPTIDE; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; RODENT MODELS; GUT HORMONE; YY3-36; MOTILITY; RATS; MECHANISM	The Y2 selective PYY derived peptide PYY3-36 was recently shown to play a role in appetite regulation. Novel PYY3-36 analogs with high selectivity for the Y2 receptor could be potential drug candidates for the treatment of obesity. The C-terminal pentapeptide segment of PYY3-36 is believed to bind to the Y receptors. Tyr-36 is highly conserved across species and only few successful modifications of Tyr-36 have been documented. PYY3-36 analogs were prepared using solid-phase peptide chemistry and tested for binding to the Y1, Y2 and Y4 receptor subtypes by radioligand displacement assay. The Y2 receptor agonists with the best affinity and selectivity were further investigated for activity towards the Y1 and Y2 receptor subtypes. Unexpectedly, modifications of Tyr-36 were well-tolerated, and the analogs of PYY3-36 in which the Tyr-36 hydroxyl group was substituted with a halogen or an amino group were particularly well tolerated and yielded an improved selectivity and approximately equipotent affinity to the Y2 receptor. These modifications could be used to design new potential drug candidates for the treatment of obesity. Copyright (C) 2009 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A novel cell-based assay for G-protein-coupled receptor-mediated cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein phosphorylation	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Article						CREB; in-cell Western; adenosine (2A); receptor; Odyssey (TM); phosphorylation	MELANOCORTIN-4 RECEPTOR; CREB; TRANSCRIPTION; NONXANTHINE; POTENT; ANTAGONISTS; ACTIVATION; GENE	Currently, the most popular means of assessing functional activity of Gs/olf-coupled receptors is via the measurement of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) accumulation. An additional readout is the downstream phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), which gives an indication of gene transcription, the ultimate response of many G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signals. Current methods of quantifying CREB phosphorylation are low throughput, and so we have designed a novel higher throughput method using the OdySSey (TM) infrared imaging system. Functional potencies of both agonists and antagonists correlate well with radioligand binding affinities determined using examples of both an endogenous (adenosine(2A) receptor in PC-12 cells) and a heterologous (human melanocortin 4 receptor in HEK-293 cells) expression system. For example, the antagonist ZM241385 demonstrates 0.23 +/- 0.03 nM affinity for the A(2A) receptor and has a functional potency of 0.26 +/- 0.04 nM determined using cAMP and 0.15 +/- 0.06 nM using CREB phosphorylation. These-data demonstrate that this novel approach for the measurement of CREB phosphorylation is a useful tool for the assessment of GPCR activity in whole cells and is more amenable to the throughput required for the purposes of drug discovery.

[C-11]1 and [C-11]2 were synthesized in high radiochemical yields by O-[C-11]methylation with [C-11]methyl triflate in acetone containing an equivalent of NaOH as a base with respect to the phenolic precursors. In vivo evaluation in rats bearing AH109A hepatoma demonstrated minimal specific binding of [C-11]1 to COX-1 in peripheral organs, such as the spleen and small intestine. Carrier-saturable uptake of [C-11]2 was found in the spleen, but COX-2-specific binding of [C-11]2 was not identifiable in the brain, AH109A hepatoma or other peripheral organs, although ex vivo autoradiography showed regionally different distribution in the brain and AH109A. The results suggest that neither [C-11]1 nor [C-11]2 is a suitable radioligand for in vivo biomarkers of COX enzymes, mainly because of marked non-specific binding.

J	Schlechtingen, G; DeHaven, RN; Daubert, JD; Cassel, J; Goodman, M				Schlechtingen, G; DeHaven, RN; Daubert, JD; Cassel, J; Goodman, M			Structure-activity relationships of dynorphin analogs substituted in positions 2 and 3	BIOPOLYMERS			English	Article						dynorphin A; kappa receptors; kappa agonists; kappa antagonists	GAMMA-S BINDING; OPIOID ACTIVITY; A ANALOGS; ALKYLATED DERIVATIVES; RECEPTOR; DESIGN; PEPTIDES; A-(1-11); ACID; PITUITARY	Following up on the observation that the dynorphin analog [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 2 possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor, a number of related peptides were prepared and characterized by radioligand binding and [S-35]GTPgammaS assays. While incorporation of 2-azetidine carboxylic acid in position 3 led to the equally potent analog 3, the corresponding analog containing piperidine-2-carboxylic acid showed a nearly 90-fold reduction in kappa affinity. Differential preferred bond angles phi in the three building blocks might account for these observations. Compounds 2 and 3 were kappa antagonists with IC50 values of 380 and 350 nM, respectively. The Sar(3) analog 7 and the Sar(2) analog 8 were kappa agonists, with greater selectivity than Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 1. In view of their high kappa affinities (8: K-i = 1.5 nM; 2: K-i = 2.4 nM), the new analogs were surprisingly weak kappa agonists or antagonists, e.g., the EC50 value,for the agonist 8 was 280 nM. Different kappa receptor subtypes in binding vs functional assays can not account for these results, since both assays were performed using the same membrane preparation.

Since dendritic cells are important inducers and regulators of immune responses, we investigated whether murine dendritic cells express functional kappa-opioid receptors. FACScan analysis and radioligand binding studies revealed the expression of kappa-opioid receptors by murine dendritic cells, which by RT-PCR were also shown to express kappa-opioid mRNA. In a primary allogenic mixed-lymphocyte reaction the kappa-agonists dynorphin A and U50,488H suppressed the capacity of dendritic cells to induce T-cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Preincubation with the kappa-specific antagonist nor-binaltrophimine abolished the observed effect, indicating specificity. In contrast, antigen uptake by dendritic cells as well as phenotypic maturation of dendritic cells were not influenced by the kappa-agonists dynorphin A and U50,488H. In summary our data demonstrate that dendritic cells express functional kappa-opioid receptors and that specific agonists exert a direct effect on these cells. Therefore, dendritic cells might be involved in the interaction of the neuroendocrine hormones and the immune system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Histamine stimulates cell proliferation in some tumor cell lines through the activation of H-1 receptors coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis. We therefore set out to study the presence of H-1 receptors in the prostate cancer cell line DU-145 and the effect of their stimulation on cell growth. METHODS. The presence of histamine receptors was studied by radioligand binding. Phosphoinositide hydrolysis was assessed by measuring [H-3]-inositol phosphate ([H-3]-IPs) accumulation and changes in the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)). Proliferation was assessed by cell counting and by [H-3]-thymidine incorporation. RESULTS. DU-145 cells express H-1 receptors (110 +/- 14 fmol/mg of protein) whose stimulation results in [H-3]-IPs accumulation (602 +/- 23% of basal, EC50 2.2 +/-0.4 muM) and calcium mobilization (resting level 96 +/-5 nM, Delta [Ca2+](i) 517 +/- 32 nM, EC50 6.2 +/-0.1 muM). Incubation with histamine (100 muM, 24 hr) resulted in a decrease in both cell number and [H-3]thymidine incorporation, blocked by the H-1 antagonist mepyramine (1 muM). CONCLUSION. Histamine inhibits the proliferation of DU-145 cells through the activation of H-1 receptors coupled to phosphoinositide hydrolysis.

Although activation of the ETA receptor causes vasoconstriction, stimulation of the ETB receptors can elicit either vasodilation or vasoconstriction. To examine the physiological role of the ETB receptor in the pulmonary circulation, we studied a genetic rat model of ETB receptor deficiency [transgenic(sl/sl)]. We hypothesized that deficiency of the ETB receptor would predispose the transgenic(sl/sl) rat lung circulation to enhanced pulmonary vasoconstriction. We found that the lungs of transgenic(sl/sl) rats are ETB deficient because they lack ETB mRNA in the pulmonary vasculature, have minimal ETB receptors as determined with an ET-1 radioligand binding assay, and lack ET-1-mediated pulmonary vasodilation. The transgenic(sl/sl) rats have higher basal pulmonary arterial pressure and vasopressor responses to brief hypoxia or ET-1 infusion. Plasma ET-1 levels are elevated and endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein content and nitric oxide production are diminished in the transgenic(sl/sl) rat lung. These findings suggest that the ETB receptor plays a major physiological role in modulating resting pulmonary vascular tone and reactivity to acute hypoxia. We speculate that impaired ETB receptor activity can contribute to the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension.

We show here that cloned human AQP1 not only mediates water flux but also serves as a cGMP-gated ion channel. Two-electrode voltage-clamp analyses showed consistent activation of an ionic conductance in wild-type AQP1-expressing oocytes after the direct injection of cGMP (50 nl of 100 mM). Current activation was not observed in control (water-injected) oocytes or in AQP5-expressing oocytes with osmotic water permeabilities equivalent to those seen with AQP1. Patch-clamp recordings revealed large conductance channels (150 pS in K+ saline) in excised patches from AQP1-expressing oocytes after the application of cGMP to the internal side. Amino acid sequence alignments between AQP1 and sensory cyclic-nucleotide-gated channels showed similarities between the cyclic-nucleotide-gated binding domain and the AQP1 carboxyl terminus that were not present in AQP5. Competitive radioligand-binding assays with [H-3]cGMP demonstrated specific binding (K-D = 0.2 mu M) in AQP1-expressing Sf9 cells but not in controls. These results indicate that AQP1 channels have the capacity to participate in ionic signaling after the activation of cGMP second-messenger pathways.

Methods: The antioxidant activities of representative calcium antagonists were examined and correlated with the molecular membrane interactions of the compounds, as measured by radioligand binding assays and high resolution differential scanning calorimetry. Results: The results of these experiments show a direct relationship between the antioxidant activities of the calcium antagonists and their affinity for the membrane lipid bilayer, as well as their ability to modulate membrane thermodynamic properties (amlodipine > verapamil much greater than diltiazem). The charged 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine had the highest affinity for the membrane bilayer (K(p)10(4)) and produced the largest changes in membrane thermodynamic properties, including a reduction in the thermal phase transition temperature (-11%), enthalpy (-14%) and cooperative unit size (-59%), relative to control phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Conclusions: These findings indicate that lipophilic calcium antagonists inhibit lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes as a result of modulating physicochemical properties of the membrane lipid bilayer, independently of calcium channel inhibition. The antioxidant activity of highly lipophilic calcium antagonists, such as amlodipine, may contribute to new cytoprotective mechanisms of action in cardiovascular disease.

We previouslyreported the effectiveness of PSMA-DA1 as a PSMA-targeting radiotheranosticagent containing an albumin binder moiety. To further enhance tumoruptake, we newly designed PSMA-NAT-DA1 (PNT-DA1) by the introductionof a lipophilic linker into PSMA-DA1. The PSMA affinity of [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 was increased (K (d) = 8.20nM) compared with that of [In-111]In-PSMA-DA1 (K (d) = 89.4 nM). [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 showed markedlyhigh tumor accumulation (131.6% injected dose/g at 48 h post-injection),and [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 enabled the visualization of thetumor clearly at 24 h post-injection with SPECT/CT imaging. The administrationof [Ac-225]Ac-PNT-DA1 (2.5 kBq) led to shrinkage of thetumor without marked toxicity, and the antitumor effects of [Ac-225]Ac-PNT-DA1 were superior to those of [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-DA1and [Ac-225]Ac-PSMA-617, which is the current gold standardfor PSMA-targeting Ac-225-endoradiotherapy. These resultssuggest that the combination of [In-111]In-PNT-DA1 and [Ac-225]Ac-PNT-DA1 comprises a promising method of PSMA-targetingradiotheranostics.

Discovery of 3-(2-aminoethyl)-thiazolidine-2,4-diones as a novel chemotype of sigma-1 receptor ligands	CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN			English	Article						docking; neuropathic pain; scaffold hopping; sigma receptor; thiazolidinedione	MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY; BINDING; ANTAGONIST; MODEL	Sigma receptor is a transmembrane non-GPCR protein expressed mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane associated with mitochondria. It is classified into two types: Sigma-1 (S1R) and Sigma-2 (S2R) based on their biological functions. S1R has been implicated in many neurological disorders such as anxiety, schizophrenia, and depression. Therefore, S1R ligands possess a variety of potential clinical applications with a great interest in the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel lead compound for S1R binding, based on the thiazolidine-2,4-dione nucleus. We have explored hydrophobic groups of different sizes on both sides of the five-membered ring scaffold guided by the crystal structure of S1R. Six compounds showed more than 50% displacement of the radioligand at 10 mu M concentration with compound 6c resulting in 100% displacement and a K-i of 95.5 nM. Moreover, compounds 6c and 6e showed a significant selectivity over S2R. In addition, molecular docking predicted that all the compounds showed the critical salt bridge with Glu172 with variable degrees of pi-stacking interaction with Tyr103. Upon optimization, this series of compounds could represent potential clinically useful S1R ligands for pain management.

Cellular association, biodistribution, and autoradiography with blocking experiments indicated specific binding of [F-18]5a to sigma(1) receptors in vitro and in vivo. Small annual positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using mouse tumor xenograft models demonstrated a high accumulation in human carcinoma and melanoma. Treatment with haloperidol significantly reduced the accumulation of the radiotracer in tumors. These findings suggest that radiotracer with suitable lipophilicity and appropriate affinity for sigma(1) receptors could be used for tumor imaging.

Furthermore, the properties of pharmaceuticals can be enhanced significantly by the introduction of fluorine groups into their original structures, and significant progress has been made during the last three decades towards the development of practical procedures for the introduction of fluorine. The replacement of the fluorine atoms present in pharmaceuticals with radioactive F-18 atoms is a rational approach for designing novel PET tracers. As a fluorine-containing pharmaceutical agent, pitavastatin has attracted considerable interest from researchers working in the life sciences because it can act as an antihyperlipidemic agent as well as a substrate for hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (hOATP). With this in mind, it was envisaged that [F-18]pitavastatin would be used as an excellent imaging agent for hOATP, which prompted us to investigate the synthesis of this agent. Herein, we report a practical method for the synthesis of [F-18]pitavastatin by the Suzuki coupling reaction of p-iodofluorobenzene and a quinoline boronate derivative, with the desired product being formed in a radiochemical yield of 12 +/- 3% (decay corrected from [F-18]fluoride ions, n = 3).

First, binding studies performed with a non selective vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT) radioligand indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites. Second, OTR mRNA was detected by RT-PCR analysis whereas transcripts for AVP V1a, V1b or V2 receptors (V1aR, V1bR and V2R respectively) were not detected. Third, the presence of functional OTRs was evidenced by showing that agonist substances having a high affinity for the human OTR, namely OT, AVP and LThr4,Gly7]OT, increased the rate of myoblasts fusion and myotubes formation in the cultures, whereas F180, a V1aR selective agonist, and dDAVP, a V2R agonist had no significant effect on the fusion process. In addition, we show by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry that the OT gene is expressed in cultured myoblasts. Taken together, our data suggest that OT may act as a paracririe/autocrine agent that stimulates the fusion of human myoblasts in vitro. In vivo, OT may be involved in the differentiation. of human skeletal muscle during postnatal growth, and possibly its regeneration following injury.

While both of these techniques have been used in the past, there is no direct and systematic comparison. In the first direct comparison of these two methods we find that the dose of haloperidol required for blocking 50% of the dopamine D-2 receptors was 0.02 mg/kg/sc (95% CIT 0.018-0.022 mg/kg)as measured using H-3-raclopride method; but was significantly higher with the EEDQ method 0.24 mg/kg/s.c. (95% CI 0.048-0.224 mg/kg). The H-3-raclopride method showed significantly lesser variance (p = 0.02) despite the higher sensitivity. This seven-fold difference in the sensitivity of the two techniques to measure antipsychotic-induced D-2 occupancy explains discrepancies in the previous studies which have used these two methods and also suggest that for future studies the H-3-raclopride method is a move sensitive and, likely, a more valid reflector of true receptor occupancy.

Western blot analysis of irradiated holoenzyme R1 and R2 yielded target sizes of 281 kDa and 57 kDa (approximately twice their expected size). Irradiation of free R1 and analysis by all methods yielded a single exponential decay with target sizes ranging from 128-153 kDa. For free R2, quantitation by enzyme activity and Western blot analyses yielded simple inactivation curves but considerably different target sizes of 223 kDa and 19 kDa, respectively; competition for radioligand binding in irradiated R2 subunits yielded two species, one with a target size of similar to 210 kDa and the other of similar to 20 kDa. These results are consistent with a model in which there is radiation energy transfer between the two monomers of both Fl and R2 only in the holoenzyme, a radiation-induced loss of free radical only in the isolated R2, and an alteration of the tertiary structure of R2.

Thus, the aim of this study was to develop mouse syngeneic melanoma model that expresses human EGFR. Cloudman S91 clone M3 mouse melanoma cells were transduced with lentiviral particles carrying the human EGFR gene followed by a multistep selection process. The resulting M3-EGFR has been tested for EGFR expression and functionality in vitro and in vivo. Radioligand assay confirmed the presence of 13,900 +/- 1500 EGF binding sites per cell at a dissociation constant of 5.3 +/- 1.4 nM. M3-EGFR demonstrated the ability to bind and internalize specifically and provide the anticipated intracellular nuclear import of three different EGFR-targeted modular nanotransporters designed for specific anti-cancer drug delivery. Introduction of the human EGFR gene did not alter the tumorigenicity of the offspring M3-EGFR cells in host immunocompetent DBA/2J mice. Preservation of the expression of EGFR in vivo was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. To sum up, we successfully developed the first mouse syngeneic melanoma model with preserved in vivo expression of human EGFR.

Studies in transgenic mice suggested abnormal cholinergic transmission in the putamen, but this has not yet been demonstrated in humans. The role of the cerebellum in the pathophysiology of the disease has also been highlighted but the involvement of the intrinsic cerebellar cholinergic system is unknown. In this study, cholinergic neurons were imaged using PET with F-18-fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol, a radioligand of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT). Here, we found an age-related decrease in VAChT expression in the posterior putamen and caudate nucleus of DYT1 patients versus matched controls, with low expression in young but not in older patients. In the cerebellar vermis, VAChT expression was also significantly decreased in patients versus controls, but independently of age. Functional connectivity within the motor network studied in MRI and the interregional correlation of VAChT expression studied in PET were also altered in patients. These results show that the cholinergic system is disrupted in the brain of DYT1 patients and is modulated over time through plasticity or compensatory mechanisms.

Identification and biochemical analyses of selective CB<sub>2</sub> agonists	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cannabinoids; Cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists; Drug discovery; Receptors	CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; HIGH-AFFINITY; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; T-CELLS; BINDING; PAIN; INVOLVEMENT; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; PHARMACOLOGY	Cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors are activated by Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, a psychoactive component of marijuana. The cannabinoid CB1 receptor is primarily located in the brain and is responsible for the psychoactive side effects, whereas the cannabinoid CB2 receptor is located in immune cells and is an attractive target for immune-related maladies. We identify small molecules that selectively bind to the cannabinoid CB2 receptor and can be further developed into therapeutics. The affinity of three molecules, ABK5, ABK6, and ABK7, to the cannabinoid CB2 receptor was determined with radioligand competition binding. The potency of G-protein coupling was determined with GTP gamma S binding. The three compounds bound selectively to the cannabinoid CB2 receptor, and no binding to the cannabinoid CB1 receptor was detected up to 10 mu M. Immunoblotting studies show that the amount of ERK1/2 and MEK phosphorylation increased in a G(i/o-)dependent manner. Furthermore, an immune cell line (Jurkat cells) was treated with ABK5, and as a result, inhibited cell proliferation. These three compounds are novel cannabinoid CB2 receptor agonists and hold promise to be further developed to treat inflammation and the often-associated pain.

Thus, SV2A targeting, using dedicated radiotracers combined with positron emission tomography (PET), allows the assessment of synaptic density in the living brain. The first-in-class fluorinated SV2A specific radioligand, [F-18]UCB-H, is now available at high activity through an efficient radiosynthesis compliant with current good manufacturing practices (cGMP). We report here a noninvasive method to quantify [F-18]UCB-H binding in rat brain with microPET. Validation study in rats confirmed the need of high enantiomeric purity to target SV2A in vivo. We demonstrated the reliability of a population-based' input function to quantify SV2A in preclinical microPET Setting. Finally, we investigated the in vivo metabolism of [F-18]UCB-H and confirmed the negligible amount of radiothetabolites in the rat brain. Hence; the in vivo quantification of SV2A using [F-15]UCB-H microPET seems a promising tool for the assessment of the synaptic density in the rat brain, and opens neurodegenerative disease rodent models. the way for longitudinal follow-up in neurodegenerative disease rodent models.

A novel thermoregulatory role for PDE10A in mouse and human adipocytes	EMBO MOLECULAR MEDICINE			English	Article						adipose tissue; energy expenditure; obesity; PDE10A; PET	BROWN ADIPOSE-TISSUE; PHOSPHODIESTERASE 10A; IN-VIVO; GLUCOSE-UPTAKE; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; NATRIURETIC PEPTIDES; SELECTIVE-INHIBITION; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS	Phosphodiesterase type 10A (PDE10A) is highly enriched in striatum and is under evaluation as a drug target for several psychiatric/neurodegenerative diseases. Preclinical studies implicate PDE10A in the regulation of energy homeostasis, but the mechanisms remain unclear. By utilizing small-animal PET/MRI and the novel radioligand [F-18]-AQ28A, we found marked levels of PDE10A in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT) of mice. Pharmacological inactivation of PDE10A with the highly selective inhibitor MP-10 recruited BAT and potentiated thermogenesis in vivo. In diet-induced obese mice, chronic administration of MP-10 caused weight loss associated with increased energy expenditure, browning of white adipose tissue, and improved insulin sensitivity. Analysis of human PET data further revealed marked levels of PDE10A in the supraclavicular region where brown/beige adipocytes are clustered in adults. Finally, the inhibition of PDE10A with MP-10 stimulated thermogenic gene expression in human brown adipocytes and induced browning of human white adipocytes. Collectively, our findings highlight a novel thermoregulatory role for PDE10A in mouse and human adipocytes and promote PDE10A inhibitors as promising candidates for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.

Pentamidine analogs as inhibitors of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]MK-801 and [<SUP>3</SUP>H]ifenprodil binding to rat brain NMDA receptors	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Pentamidine; NMDA receptor; Ifenprodil; Polyamine; Bisbenzamidine; Alkylation; Coupling; Radioligand binding; Rat brain; Molecular docking	PNEUMOCYSTIS-CARINII AGENTS; QUINOLINIC ACID; SOLID-STATE; 1,5-BIS(4-AMIDINOPHENOXY)PENTANE PENTAMIDINE; SUBUNIT ARRANGEMENT; STRUCTURAL-ANALYSIS; NMR-SPECTROSCOPY; MOLECULAR-BASIS; POLYAMINES; IFENPRODIL	The anti-protozoal drug pentamidine is active against opportunistic Pneumocystis pneumonia, but in addition has several other biological targets, including the NMDA receptor (NR). Here we describe the inhibitory potencies of 76 pentamidine analogs at 2 binding sites of the NR, the channel binding site labeled with [H-3]MK-801 and the [H-3]ifenprodil binding site. Most analogs acted weaker at the ifenprodil than at the channel site. The spermine-sensitivity of NR inhibition by the majority of the compounds was reminiscent of other long-chain dicationic NR blockers. The potency of the parent compound as NR blocker was increased by modifying the heteroatoms in the bridge connecting the 2 benzamidine moieties and also by integrating the bridge into a seven-membered ring. Docking of the 45 most spermine-sensitive bisbenzamidines to a recently described acidic interface between the N-terminal domains of GluN1 and GluN2B mediating polyamine stimulation of the NR revealed the domain contributed by GluN1 as the most relevant target.

Various approaches have been adopted to interface MIPs with different transducers, including the use of pre-made imprinted particles and the in situ preparation of thin polymer layers directly on transducer surfaces. In this work we functionalized quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor crystals by coating the sensing surfaces with pre-made molecularly imprinted nanoparticles. The nanoparticles were immobilized on the QCM transducers by physical entrapment in a thin poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) layer that was spin-coated on the transducer surface. By controlling the deposition conditions, it was possible to gain a high nanoparticle loading in a stable PET layer, allowing the recognition sites in nanoparticles to be easily accessed by the test analytes. In this work, different sensor surfaces were studied by micro-profilometry and atomic force microscopy and the functionality was evaluated using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). The molecular recognition capability of the sensors were also confirmed using radioligand binding analysis by testing their response to the presence of the test compounds, (R)- and (S)-propranolot in aqueous buffer.

The aim of this research was to examine whether histamine H3 receptors can be visualized in vivo and in vitro with [F-18]3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl)propyI 4-fluorobenzyl ether (fluoroproxyfan). [F-18] Fluoroproxyfan was synthesized with high specific activity using [18F]benzyl bromide. The binding of [18F]fluoroproxyfan to rat brain homogenates was higher in the striatum and thalamus and was lowest in the cerebellum. The in vitro autoradiographic study successfully demonstrated the specific binding of [F-18]fluoroproxyfan to the H3 receptor in the rat brain. In accordance with the in vitro bindings, the in vivo distribution of [18F]fluoroproxyfan was heterogeneous in the rat brain. In the blocking experiments, the heterogeneous distribution disappeared in the presence of large amounts of fluoroproxyfan. These data suggest that [18F]fluoroproxyfan can be potentially useful to image histamine H3 receptor noninvasively in the human brain by positron emission tomography. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

A preliminary study of dopamine transporter binding in bipolar and unipolar depressed patients and healthy controls	NEUROPSYCHOBIOLOGY			English	Article						[Tc-99m] TRODAT-1; single photon emission computed tomography; dopamine transporter; bipolar disorder; depression	MAJOR DEPRESSION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; AVAILABILITY; AMPHETAMINE; SEROTONIN; ESTROGEN	Objective: We examined striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) binding in bipolar and unipolar depressed patients and compared these values to those obtained from healthy control subjects using the selective DAT radioligand [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 and single photon emission computed tomography imaging. We hypothesized that DAT levels might be higher in bipolar versus unipolar patients. Methods: [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 scans were acquired from 5 bipolar and 10 unipolar patients and from 46 healthy controls. Distribution volume ratio (DVR) of [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 binding affinity was calculated for regions of interest in the striatum. Results: Bipolar patients had greater DVR values compared to controls in the right posterior putamen (p = 0.001) and in the left caudate region (p = 0.007). Bipolar patients had modestly lower DAT binding in all brain regions examined, and a significantly lower DVR in the right caudate region compared to unipolar patients (p = 0.05). Conclusion: These data suggest that striatal DAT density may be increased in bipolar and unipolar depressed patients compared to controls, and that bipolar and unipolar depressed patients may have a different pattern of striatal DAT binding.

N-substitution and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptor affinity of laudanosine analogues	JOURNAL OF THE CHILEAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor binding; norlaudanosine; laudanosine; N-alkylnorlaudanosines; benzyltetrahydroisoquinolines; tetrahydropalmatine; glaucine	ALPHA(1A)-ADRENOCEPTOR; MECHANISM; SUBTYPES; BOLDINE	Benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline (BTHIQ) molecules are able to adopt widely differing conformations that depend on the presence or absence of N-substituents. To assess the possible role of BTHIQ conformation on the affinity of these compounds for alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors, of interest for the management of hypertension, the racemic N-unsubstituted BTHIQ norlaudanosine and a series of N-alkylated derivatives were assessed for binding to rat brain cortical sites labelled with the radioligand [H-3]prazosin. The alpha(1)-adrenergic affinity in this series increased with the bulk of the substituent on the nitrogen atom, from the N-ethyl to the N-propyl analogue. Comparison of these results with published data for related BTHIQs and for the rigid mimics of the fully extended and semi-folded conformations of laudanosine, tetrahydropalmatine and glaucine, suggested that the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor binding site is able to accommodate either conformation. The presence of a bulky substituent on the nitrogen atom seems to favor receptor binding independently of the favored conformation, and that the orientation in which BTHIQs are bound probably differs depending on the presence or absence of a hydroxyl group at a key position.

Using seven highly selective dopamine-receptor (DR) agonists and antagonists we found that TNF alpha-upregulation, evident after 24 h, was mediated by D3R and D1/D5R while IL-10-upregulation, evident after 72 h, was mediated by D2R and D1/D5R. We confirmed the expression of D2R and D3R in these human T cells. Dopamine's unique ability to trigger a selective secretion of either TNF alpha only (via D3R) or IL-10 only (via D2R) or both (via D1/D5R), differs front the robust and non-selective cytokine-secretion induced by 'classical, TCR-activation, and as such may have important beneficial or detrimental implications in various immunological and neurological diseases/injuries/cancers.

The open-field test was chosen as the discrimination test of CCK2B agonists. The most interesting agonist, BBL454 (0.03-300 mug/kg) induced hyperactivity which was blocked by a CCK2 antagonist, the D1 antagonist SCH23390, the delta-opioid antagonist naltrindole, but not a CCK1 antagonist. All compounds active in the open-field test are characterised by a common structural feature, -COCH2CO-Trp-NMeNle-Asp-Phe-NH2,whereas inactive compounds do not possess such a motive. Therefore, this feature can be considered crucial for CCK2B activity. BBL454 (0.03-3 mug/kg) improved memory in a two-trial memory test while it was very weakly active on the peripheral CCK2 receptor, and did not evoke anxiogenic effects in the plus-maze test. The synthesis of BBL454 is simple, its minimal active dose is 30 ng/kg and no "bell-shaped" responses were observed. These results suggest that BBL454 could be considered to be the new CCK2B reference agonist.

This study evaluated the effects of three modulators on the binding of [H-3] N-methylscopolamine ([H-3] NMS) to the human M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor ( mAChR). The binding of each modulator was more complex than predicted by the ATCM; the inhibitors heptane-1,7-bis-(dimethyl-3- phthalimidopropyl)-ammonium bromide and gallamine yielded biphasic curves that were described empirically by a two-site binding model, whereas the enhancer alcuronium yielded a bell-shaped curve. Radioligand dissociation assays revealed that the modulators retarded [H-3] NMS kinetics such that the system never attained equilibrium. Subsequent application of a kinetic ATCM accommodated and quantified all experimental observations. Our findings confirm and extend previous studies on the use of a kinetic ATCM for mAChR allosteric enhancers, but also highlight how complex curves displayed by allosteric inhibitors can be misinterpreted in terms of multisite orthosteric binding. It is possible that similar behavior of other allosteric modulators at GPCRs may reflect nonequilibrium binding artifacts rather than deviation from an ATCM.

Fractional shortening was measured using a video edge-detection system in control- and isoproterenol-stimulated myocytes that had been isolated from weight-matched rats. Number and affinity of the beta -adrenergic receptors and the L-type Ca2+ channel were measured in ventricular cardiac membranes by radioligand binding studies. Control- and isoproterenol-mediated alteration in Ca2+ current density (I-Ca) was determined by patch clamping and cellular cAMP content was determined by radioimmunoassay. Study results demonstrate that female myocytes have higher Ca2+ channel density and greater I-Ca than male myocytes. However, isoproterenol elicits a greater beta -adrenergic receptor-mediated increase cell shortening, I-Ca and cAMP production in male myocytes. Male myocytes were also found to have a higher beta -adrenergic receptor density. These results suggest that cardiac myocytes from male rats have an enhanced response to beta -adrenergic stimulation due to augmented beta -adrenergic signaling that results in a greater transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx.

Hampered by the structural similarity of the five subtypes' orthosteric binding pockets, these efforts largely failed to deliver subtype-selective ligands. Building on our recent successes with arecaidine-derived ligands targeting M-1, herein we report the synthesis of a related series of 11 hydroxylated arecaidine esters. Their physicochemical property profiles, expressed in terms of their computationally calculated CNS MPO scores and HPLC-logD values, point towards blood-brain barrier permeability. By means of a competitive radioligand binding assay, the binding affinity values towards each of the individual human mAChR subtypes hM(1)-hM(5) were determined. The most promising compound of this series 17b was shown to have a binding constant towards hM(1) in the single-digit nanomolar region (5.5 nM). Similar to our previously reported arecaidine-derived esters, the entire series was shown to act as hM1R antagonists in a calcium flux assay. Overall, this study greatly expanded our understanding of this recurring scaffolds' structure-activity relationship and will guide the development towards highly selective mAChRs ligands.

Since then, radioiodine has become broadly established clinically for diagnostic imaging and therapy of benign and malignant thyroid disease, worldwide. However, only since the approval of SSTR2-targeting theranostics following the NETTER-1 trial in neuroendocrine tumours and the positive outcome of the VISION trial has theranostics gained substantial attention beyond nuclear medicine. The roll-out of radioligand therapy for treating a high-incidence tumour such as prostate cancer requires the expansion of existing and the establishment of new theranostics centres. Despite wide global variation in the regulatory, financial and medical landscapes, this guide attempts to provide valuable information to enable interested stakeholders to safely initiate and operate theranostics centres. This enabling guide does not intend to answer all possible questions, but rather to serve as an overarching framework for multiple, more detailed future initiatives. It recognizes that there are regional differences in the specifics of regulation of radiation safety, but common elements of best practice valid globally.

Human Cortical Serotonin 2A Receptor Occupancy by Psilocybin Measured Using [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MDL 100,907 Dynamic PET and a Resting-State fMRI-Based Brain Parcellation	FRONTIERS IN NEUROERGONOMICS			English	Article						psychedelics; neuropsychopharmacology; psilocybin; PET; fMRI; resting state; receptor occupancy; MDL 100,907	LIFE-THREATENING CANCER; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; 5-HT2A RECEPTORS; LSD; EXPERIENCE; BINDING; DEPRESSION; INHIBITION; ATTENTION; REDUCTION	Psilocybin (a serotonin 2A, or 5-HT2A, receptor agonist) has shown preliminary efficacy as a treatment for mood and substance use disorders. The current report utilized positron emission tomography (PET) with the selective 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist radioligand [C-11]MDL 100,907 (a.k.a. M100,907) and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) derived from resting-state functional connectivity-based brain parcellations in 4 healthy volunteers (2 females) to determine regional occupancy/target engagement of 5-HT2A receptors after oral administration of a psychoactive dose of psilocybin (10 mg/70 kg). Average 5-HT2A receptor occupancy across all ROIs was 39.5% (+/- 10.9% SD). Three of the ROIs with greatest occupancy (between 63.12 and 74.72% occupancy) were within the default mode network (subgenual anterior cingulate and bilateral angular gyri). However, marked individual variability in regional occupancy was observed across individuals. These data support further investigation of the relationship between individual differences in the acute and enduring effects of psilocybin and the degree of regional 5-HT2A receptor occupancy.

Thus, further advances in radiopharmaceutical design and therapy strategies are needed to reduce salivary gland uptake, thereby allowing the administration of higher doses and potentially resulting in improved response rates and better tumor control. As the uptake mechanism remains unknown, this work investigates the salivary gland uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 by autoradiography studies on pig salivary gland tissue and on PSMA-overexpressing LNCaP cell membrane pellets. Displacement studies were performed with non-labeled PSMA-617 and 2-PMPA, respectively. The uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in glandular areas was determined to be partly PSMA-specific, with a high non-specific uptake fraction. The study emphasizes that [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 accumulation in pig salivary glands can be attributed to a combination of both specific and non-specific uptake mechanisms. The observation is of high impact for future design of novel radiopharmaceuticals addressing the dose-limiting salivary gland irradiation of current alpha endoradiotherapy in prostate cancer.

Quantitative PET Reporter Gene Imaging with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Trimethoprim	MOLECULAR THERAPY			English	Article							DIHYDROFOLATE-REDUCTASE; TRIMETHOPRIM-SULFAMETHOXAZOLE; METHOTREXATE; THERAPY; SELECTIVITY	There is a need for improved methods to image genetically engineered cells, including immune cells used for cell-based therapy. Given the genetic manipulation inherent to gene therapy, the use of a reporter protein is a logical solution and positron emission tomography (PET) can provide the desired sensitivity and spatial localization. We developed a broadly applicable PET imaging strategy based on the small bacterial protein E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (Ec dhfr) and its highly specific small molecule inhibitor, trimethoprim (TMP). The difference in TMP affinity for bacterial compared to mammalian DHFR suggests that a TMP radioligand would have a low background in unmodified mammalian tissues and high retention in Ec dhfr engineered cells, providing high contrast imaging. Here, we describe the in vitro properties of [C-11]TMP and show over 10-fold increased signal in transgenic Ec dhfr cells compared to control. In a mouse xenograft model, [C-11]TMP rapidly accumulated in Ec dhfr carrying cells within minutes of intravenous administration. Moreover, [C-11]TMP can identify less than a million xenografted cells in a small volume in tissues other than the abdominal compartment. This limit of detection is a clinically relevant number and bodes well for clinical translation especially given that [C-11]TMP is an isotopologue of clinically approved antibiotic.

Search for adequate radioligands suitable for in vivo imaging is therefore still in progress. The potential neuroleptic drug 6-(4-[4-fluorobenzyl]piperazin-1-yl)benzodioxin shows high affinity and selectivity to the D-4 receptor. Derivatization of this lead structure by adding hydrophilic moieties was carried out in order to lower its lipophilicity what led to three new putative dopamine receptor D-4 ligands. A comprehensive description of the syntheses of standard compounds and corresponding labeling precursors is given which were obtained in satisfactory yields. Furthermore, the radiosyntheses by direct F-18-labeling and build-up synthesis were compared. All derivatives of 6-(4-[4-fluorobenzyl]-piperazin-1-yl)benzodioxin were successfully synthesized in F-18-labeled form with radiochemical yields of 9-35% and molar activities of 30-60GBq/mu mol using one-pot procedures.

We characterized a number of its in vivo pharmacokinetic properties, including the evaluation of its two stereo-isomers, saturability of specific binding, selectivity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors, and vulnerability to pharmacologically induced increases in endogenous 5-HT levels. Six isoflurane-anesthetized baboons were scanned with [C-11] P943 at baseline, and following various pharmacological manipulations. The interventions included the administration of pharmacological doses of P943, SB-616234-S (a 5-HT1B selective antagonist), SB-714786 (a 5-HT1D selective antagonist), as well as the administration of 5-HT releasing agents (fenfluramine, amphetamine) and 5-HT reuptake inhibitor (citalopram). [C-11] P943 was observed to bind saturably and specifically to 5-HT1B receptors and to be sensitive to all three challenges known to alter 5-HT levels in the proximity of receptors. [C-11] P943 shows promise as a tracer to image serotonin function in healthy subjects as well as subjects with psychiatric or neurologic conditions. Synapse 65:1119-1127, 2011.

Radioligand binding studies have hitherto been performed with iodinated Ang IV in the presence of divalent cation chelators EDTA and 1,10-phenanthrolin. Hence, they referred to the apo-form of IRAP. Presently, binding of [H-3]Ang IV and [H-3]AL-11, a stable Ang IV analog, was compared on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) and mouse hippocampal (P40H1) cell membranes. With chelators, their high affinity sites showed the same pharmacological profile as for [I-125]Ang IV binding. Without chelators, only high affinity binding was perceived for [H-3]AL-11. The same pharmacological profile was recorded in both membrane preparations; it was different from the one in the presence of chelators and corresponded to catalytically active IRAP (despite the concurrent presence of aminopeptidase N (APN) in P40H1 cell membranes). This confirms that the active and apo-forms of IRAP have a distinct pharmacological profile. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adenosine A(3) receptor (A(3)R) binding was studied in rat and bovine testis. Results confirmed species differences in AR saturation-displacement binding parameters. To investigate A(3)Rs in CNS, we carried out immunoblot in human brain, resolving two signals, a 52 KDa band with the highest density in hippocampus and a 48 KDa one, slightly more expressed in cortex. Subsequently, A(3)R binding was performed by [I-125]-4-aminobenzyl-5'-N-methylcarboxamidoadenosine ([I-125]-AB-MECA) in human hippocampus, revealing an high affinity population of sites and another non saturable component. [I-125]-AB-MECA first site displacement by N-6 (3-iodobenzyl)adenosine-5'-N-methyluronamide (IB-MECA) and 1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopenthyl-xanthine (DPCPX) distinguished two affinity sites, being only in part identified as A(3)Rs. Therefore, A(3)Rs result clearly expressed by Western blot in human brain, but their full CNS characterization needs further investigation.

In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably cotransfected with adenosine A(2A) and dopamine D-2 receptors, homocysteine selectively decreased the ability of D-2 receptor stimulation to internalize adenosine A(2A)-dopamine D-2 receptor complexes. Radioligand-binding experiments in the same cell line demonstrated that homocysteine acts as an allosteric D-2 receptor antagonist, by selectively reducing the affinity of D-2 receptors for agonists but not for antagonists. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that, by means of an arginine (Arg)-thiol electrostatic interaction, homocysteine forms noncovalent complexes with the two Arg-rich epitopes of the third intracellular loop of the D-2 receptor, one of them involved in A(2A)-D-2 receptor heteromerization. However, homocysteine was unable to prevent or disrupt A(2A)-D-2 receptor heteromerization, as demonstrated with Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) experiments in stably cotransfected HEK cells. The present results could have implications for Parkinson's disease.

The presence of A(2A) and A(2B) ARs was assessed by immunoblotting using specific antibodies. Equilibrium A(2A) and A(2B) ARs binding parameters were evaluated by radioligand binding assay. Functional studies were conducted to investigate coupling of the A(2B) AR to the adenylyl cyclase pathway. This is the first report of the use of Western blot analysis to confirm the presence of A(2A) and A(2B) ARs in human neutrophils. No significant changes in A(2A) AR binding parameters or expression levels were detected between SSc patients and healthy control individuals. A significant decrease (65%) in the maximum density of A(2B) AR binding sites occurred in SSc neutrophils, whereas no changes in the affinity constant values were found. Moreover, a decrease in A(2B) AR mediated adenylyl cyclase activity was observed in patients with SSc. Our findings demonstrate the occurrence of selective alterations in A2B AR density and signalling in SSc.

Here, we have used autoradiography to examine whether the increase in 12 site density induced by chronic administration of 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline (2-BFI) is uniform across brain regions. We dosed rats with 2-BFI 7 mg/kg or with saline vehicle i.p. over 96 days. Compared with vehicle-treated rats, this treatment significantly increased specific [H-3]2-BFI binding only in the arcuate nucleus and area postrema, by 63% and 67% respectively. There were no significant effects in the pineal gland or interpeduncular nucleus which, like the arcuate nucleus and area postrema, are rich in I-2 sites. These data indicate that chronic administration of 2-BFI selectively alters radioligand binding in two I-2 rich brain ideas, namely the arcuate nucleus and area postrema, suggesting there may be more than one population of I-2 sites in the rat brain.

We report cloning, pharmacological characterization, tissue distribution and detailed brain mapping of melanocortin 5 receptor in goldfish (gMC5R). The goldfish orthologue protein is 69% identical to human MC5R and is conserved in important functional domains. The gMC5R showed similar potency to alpha-, beta- and gamma-MSH peptides in radioligand binding as the mammalian orthologues, while MTII and HS024 were both agonists at this receptor. The gMC5R-mRNA was found in the peripheral tissues including kidney, spleen, skin and retina, with low expression levels in the intestine, fat, muscle, gill, pituitary and ovary. In situ<x> hybridization studies demonstrated that gMC5R transcripts are widely distributed in the goldfish brain. The gMC5R expression was found in ventral telencephalon, pre-optic area, dorsal and ventral thalamus, infundibular hypothalamus, posterior tuberculum, tectum and tegmentum mesencephali, reticular formation, vagal and facial lobes and spinal cord. The cloning and characterization of this receptor provides an important tool to elucidate its participation in neuroendocrine and behavioural control.

Blood samples were taken from 205 children at 6 weeks, 6 months, 18 months, and 5 years of age. Autoantibodies against GAD(65) (GADA), tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A), and insulin (IAA) were determined by radioligand-binding assays. All children had detectable levels of GADA and approximately half had IA-2A, but only approximately 10% had detectable levels of IAA during the follow-up period. Many children developed IA-2A already at 6 months of age, similar concentrations were seen at 18 months, and then the levels of IA-2A decreased until 5 years of age. GADA were induced less often at 6 months of age, increased up to 18 months, and fluctuated at similar levels up to 5 years of age. IAA were detectable in so few children and at low levels, so no trend in natural course could be revealed. We conclude that there is a natural induction of humoral immune response to 13 cell autoantigens early in life. Our results suggest that the mechanisms of 0 cell tolerance to GAD and IA-2 differ in healthy children.

The present study was performed in order to investigate whether a peripheral serotonin system marker, the platelet 5-HT2A receptor, is affected in dementia. Thirty-eight patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 13 patients with vascular dementia, and 40 healthy controls were included in the study. There were no significant differences in receptor density for 5-HT2A receptor binding between the groups. Affinity of the radioligand to the receptor was significantly lower in AD than in vascular dementia and in the controls (p = .006 and p = .003, respectively), whereas there was no significant difference between the vascular dementia group and the control group. In 12 patients, treatment with citalopram was started due to depression or agitation. This treatment significantly reduced the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale scores (p = .001), but did not affect the platelet 5-HT2A receptor status. There was no correlation between 5-HT2A receptor status before treatment and the therapeutic effect of citalopram. The study indicates that platelet 5-HT2A receptor status is of limited value as a peripheral marker in dementia.

Variants in this gene are causatively implicated in different forms of epilepsy and also more severe epilepsy-related neurodevelopmental syndromes. Here we study functional consequences of a novel de novo missense GABRA1 variant, p.(Ala332Val), identified through exome sequencing in an individual affected by early-onset syndromic epileptic encephalopathy. The variant is localised within the transmembrane domain helix 3 (TM3) and in silico prediction algorithms suggested this variant to be likely pathogenic. In vitro assessment revealed unchanged protein levels, regular assembly and forward trafficking to the cell surface. On the functional level a significant left shift of the apparent GABA potency in two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology experiments was observed, as well as changes in the extent of desensitization. Additionally, apparent diazepam potency was left shifted in radioligand displacement assays. During prenatal development mainly alpha2/3 subunits are expressed, whereas after birth a switch to alpha1 occurs. The expression of alpha1 in humans is upregulated during the first years. Thus, the molecular change of function reported here supports pathogenicity and could explain early-onset of seizures in the affected individual.

The receptor responsible for succinate signalling, SUCNR1 (also known as GPR91), is a member of the G-protein-coupled-receptor family(2) and links succinate signalling to renin-induced hypertension, retinal angiogenesis and inflammation(3-5). Because SUCNR1 senses succinate as an immunological danger signal(6)-which has relevance for diseases including ulcerative colitis, liver fibrosis(7), diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis(3,8)-it is of interest as a therapeutic target. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of rat SUCNR1 in complex with an intracellular binding nanobody in the inactive conformation. Structure-based mutagenesis and radioligand-binding studies, in conjunction with molecular modelling, identified key residues for species-selective antagonist binding and enabled the determination of the high-resolution crystal structure of a humanized rat SUCNR1 in complex with a high-affinity, human-selective antagonist denoted NF-56-EJ40. We anticipate that these structural insights into the architecture of the succinate receptor and its antagonist selectivity will enable structure-based drug discovery and will further help to elucidate the function of SUCNR1 in vitro and in vivo.

Obesity is associated with upregulation of the endocannabinoid system, and blocking the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) has been shown to cause weight loss and to decrease cardiometabolic risk factors. These effects may be mediated partly via increased BAT metabolism, since there is evidence that CB1R antagonism activates BAT in rodents. To investigate the significance of CB1R in BAT function, we quantified the density of CB1R in human and rodent BAT using the positron emission tomography radioligand [F-18]FMPEP-d(2) and measured BAT activation in parallel with the glucose analog [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose. Activation by cold exposure markedly increased CB1R density and glucose uptake in the BAT of lean men. Similarly, 3-receptor agonism increased CB1R density in the BAT of rats. In contrast, overweight men with reduced BAT activity exhibited decreased CB1R in BAT, reflecting impaired endocannabinoid regulation. Image-guided biopsies confirmed CB1R mRNA expression in human BAT. Furthermore, CB1R blockade increased glucose uptake and lipolysis of brown adipocytes. Our results highlight that CB1Rs are significant for human BAT activity, and the CB1Rs provide a novel therapeutic target for BAT activation in humans.

Herein, we present an investigation of the in vivo efficacy and dosimetry of a PRIT strategy for colorectal carcinoma based on the ligation between a Lu-177-labeled Tz radioligand ((177)LuDOTA-PEG(7)-Tz) and a TCO-bearing immunoconjugate of the huA33 antibody (huA33-TCO). Biodistribution studies in tumor-bearing mice using intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h between the administration of huA33-TCO and Lu-177-DOTA-PEG(7)-Tz revealed that a 24 h lag time produced the most promising in vivo results: high activity concentrations in the tumor (21.2 %ID/g +/- 2.9 at 24 h postinjection), low uptake in nontarget tissues, and favorable dosimetry (an effective dose of 0.054 mSv/MBq). A subsequent longitudinal therapy study revealed striking differences between both the survival and tumor growth of the treatment and control cohorts, dearly underscoring the promise of this approach for the radiotherapy of colorectal carcinoma.

Our report is a simplified 1-pot, 2-step radiosynthesis of [F-18]-THK-5351. This report is broadly applicable for routine clinical production and multi-center trials on account of favorable half-life of flourine-18 and the use of a commercially available radiosynthesis module, the GE TRACERlab T FXFN. First, the O-THP protected tosyl precursor underwent nucleophilic fluorinating reaction with potassium cryptand fluoride ([F-18] fluoride (K[F-18]/K222)) in Dimethyl sulfoxide at 110 degrees C for 10 minutes followed by O-THP removal by using diluted hydrochloric acid (HCl) at same temperature. [F-18]-THK-5351 was purified via semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography and formulated by using 10% EtOH, United States Pharmacopeia (USP) in 0.9% sodium chloride for injection, USP and an uncorrected radiochemical yield of 21 +/- 3.5%, with a specific activity of 153.11 +/- 25.9 GBq/mu mol (4138 +/- 700 mCi/mu mol) at the end of synthesis (63 minutes; n = 3).

Nonetheless, it is useful to study their fundamental binding properties, and to obtain average properties. In particular, it has been instructive to compare the binding properties of imprinted and non-imprinted materials. This chapter begins by considering the origins of this site heterogeneity. Next, the properties of interest of imprinted binding sites are described in brief: affinity, selectivity, and kinetics. The binding/adsorption isotherm, the graph of concentration of analyte bound to a MIP versus concentration of free analyte at equilibrium, over a range of total concentrations, is described in some detail. Following this, the techniques for studying the imprinted sites are described (batch-binding assays, radioligand binding assays, zonal chromatography, frontal chromatography, calorimetry, and others). Thereafter, the parameters that influence affinity, selectivity and kinetics are discussed (solvent, modifiers of organic solvents, pH of aqueous solvents, temperature). Finally, mathematical attempts to fit the adsorption isotherms for imprinted materials, so as to obtain information about the range of binding affinities characterizing the imprinted sites, are summarized.

Development of a Fluorescence Assay for the Characterization of Brevenal Binding to Rat Brain Synaptosomes	JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS			English	Article							DINOFLAGELLATE KARENIA-BREVIS; GATED SODIUM-CHANNELS; BREVETOXICOSIS; ANTAGONIST; LIGANDS; TOXIN; MODEL	The marine dinoflagellate Karenia brevis produces a family of neurotoxins known as brevetoxins. Brevetoxins elicit their effects by binding to and activating voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs) in cell membranes. K. brevis also produces brevenal, a brevetoxin antagonist, which is able to inhibit and/or negate many of the detrimental effects of brevetoxins. Brevenal binding to VSSCs has yet to be fully characterized, in part due to the difficulty and expense of current techniques. In this study, we have developed a novel fluorescence binding assay for the brevenal binding site. Several fluorescent compounds were conjugated to brevenal to assess their effects on brevenal binding. The assay was validated against the radioligand assay for the brevenal binding site and yielded comparable equilibrium inhibition constants. The fluorescence-based assay was shown to be quicker and far less expensive and did not generate radioactive waste or need facilities for handling radioactive materials. In-depth studies using the brevenal conjugates showed that, while brevenal conjugates do bind to a binding site in the VSSC protein complex, they are not displaced by known VSSC site specific ligands. As such, brevenal elicits its action through a novel mechanism and/or currently unknown receptor site on VSSCs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy Sprague-Dawley rats were used as an animal model. Cell membrane proteins of lung tissue were harvested after the whole lung received 20 Gy of Co-60 gamma irradiation. I-125-labeled iodopindolol (I-125-IPIN) was used as a ligand of beta-adrenergic receptors. The numbers of the beta-adrenergic receptors were determined by radioligand-receptor binding assay (RBA). Data were compared with irreversible blockage using antagonist bromoacetylalprenololmenthan (BAAM). RESULTS: The post-radiation RBA assay showed that the number of beta-adrenergic receptors in lung tissue decreased at a steady rate. It decreased to 48% of the normal level at the 15th day after irradiation. At 40 days after radiation the level of beta-adrenergic receptors started to increase at a steady rate and reached to the normal level around 70 days after radiation. There were significant differences in receptor synthesis, degradation and regeneration rates between irradiation group and BAMM group. CONCLUSIONS: The whole lung irradiation could severely affect the levels of beta-adrenergic receptors. The potential clinical implications of radiation-induced changes of beta-adrenergic receptors warrant further investigation.

Activated macrophages express high levels of the translocator protein/peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (TSPO/PBR). In this study, we investigated the potential for quantifying plaque inflammation by targeting this receptor. TSPO expression and distribution in the plaque were quantified using radioligand binding assays and autoradiography. We show that cultured human macrophages expressed 20 times more TSPO than cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), the other abundant cell type in plaque. The TSPO ligands [(3)H](R)1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methyl-(1-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinoline carboxamide ([(3)H](R)-PK11195) and [(3)H] N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(5-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)acetamide ([(3)H]-DAA1106) bound to the same sites in human carotid atherosclerotic plaques in vitro, and demonstrated significant correlation with macrophage-rich regions. In conclusion, our data indicate that radioisotope-labelled DAA1106 has the potential to quantify the macrophage content of atherosclerotic plaque. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods Responsiveness to the beta-adrenergic agonists isoprenaline, BRL37344, forskolin, and dibutyryl cyclic AMP (DBcAMP) was examined in samples from 10 older patients by using a cellular function test. A radioligand binding assay was performed using the non-selective p-adrenergic receptor ligand [H-3]-dihydroalprenolol ([H-3]-DHA). Specimens from 10 young men were used as controls. Results There were no age-dependent changes in contractile response to KCl. The relaxation responses to isoprenaline, BRL37344, and forskolin decreased in the aged group by 15.0%, 17.6%, and 12.6%, respectively (P < 0.001). The pD(2) values for isoprenaline and BRL37344 also declined significantly. There was no difference in the responsiveness to dibutyryl cyclic AMP ( DBcAMP) between the two groups; the maximum binding site decreased significantly with increasing age, but the equilibrium-dissociation constant did not change. Conclusions There is an age-related decline in beta-adrenergic responsiveness which might be one of the causative factors of reduced bladder compliance in the elderly. A decrease in cAMP level caused by reduced receptor density and adenylyl cyclase activity might be the underlying molecular mechanism of the changes in P-adrenergic responsiveness.

Bilaterally ovariectomized rabbits were divided into four groups of six. Wereas the control group received no treatment, the remaining rabbits were treated with estrogen orland tamoxifen. Cytosolic and nuclear fractions were isolated from the uterus, vagina, urethra and urinary bladder and used for binding site assay, by radioligand binding. The total weight of the rabbit vagina and uterus was increased significantly by both estradiol, tamoxifen and the combination of the two. The total weight of the urethra was increased only in the combination group. The cytosol binding site was downregulated by estradiol, tamoxifen and combination in the uterus, and in the vagina. Cytosol binding site in the urethra was not detected. The combination of estrogen-tamoxifen markedly reduced the nuclear binding site in the urethra and decreased affinity of the nuclear binding sites in all three tissues. The data suggest that tamoxifen has a specific ability to modulate the transcriptional activity of the estrogen binding sites in the rabbit urogenital tract.

Tumoral Ki67 and PSMA Expression in Fresh Pre-PSMA-RLT Biopsies and Its Relation With PSMA-PET Imaging and Outcomes of PSMA-RLT in Patients With mCRPC	CLINICAL GENITOURINARY CANCER			English	Article						Immunohistochemistry; Prostate cancer; Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Radioligand therapy	RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; LUNG-CANCER; THERAPY; ANTIGEN	In this retrospective observational study we focused on the failure of prostate specific membrane antigenradioligand therapy. Therefore we evaluated the correlation between PSMA uptake on positron emission tomography/computed tomography and PSMA protein expression on IHC on fresh biopsy leasion of mCRPC-patients. Secondly we PSMA uptake on PET/CT, protein expression of PSMA and Ki67 were associated with the therapeutic outcome of PSMA-RLT.Introduction: Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) directed radioligand therapy (RLT) is a novel therapy for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. However, it is still poorly understood why approximately 40% of the patients does not respond to PSMA-RLT. The aims of this study were to evaluate the pretreatment PSMA expression on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and PSMA uptake on PET/CT imaging in mCRPC patients who underwent PSMA-RLT. We correlated these parameters and a cell proliferation marker (Ki67) to the therapeutic efficacy of PSMA-RLT. Patients and Methods: In this retrospective study, mCRPC patients who underwent PSMARLT were analyzed. Patients biopsies were scored for immunohistochemical Ki67 expression, PSMA staining intensity and percentage of cells with PSMA expression. Moreover, the PSMA tracer uptake of the tumor lesion(s) and healthy organs on PET/CT imaging was assessed. The primary outcome was to evaluate the association between histological PSMA protein expression of tumor in pre-PSMA-RLT biopsies and the PSMA uptake on PSMA PET/CT imaging of the biopsied lesion. Secondary outcomes were to assess the relationship between PSMA expression and Ki67 on IHC and the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) following PSMA-RLT. Results: In total, 22 mCRPC patients were included in this study. Nineteen (86%) patients showed a high and homogenous PSMA expression of > 80% on IHC. Three (14%) patients had low PSMA expression on IHC. Although there was limited PSMA uptake on PET/CT imaging, these 3 patients had lower PSMA uptake on PET/CT imaging compared to the patients with high PSMA expression on IHC. Yet, no correlation was found between PSMA uptake on PET/CT imaging and PSMA expression on IHC (SUVmax: R 2 = 0.046 and SUVavg: R 2 = 0.036). The 3 patients had a shorter PFS compared to the patients with high PSMA expression on IHC (HR: 4.76, 95% CI: 1.14-19.99; P = .033). Patients with low Ki67 expression had a longer PFS and OS compared to patients with a high Ki67 expression (HR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.15-1.06; P = .013) Conclusion: The PSMA uptake on PSMA-PET/CT generally followed the PSMA expression on IHC.

Due to its participation in these pathologies, the development of selective modulators for this ion channel is a promising strategy for rational drug therapy. The prototypical negative allosteric modulator ifenprodil inhibits selectively GluN2B subunit containing NMDA receptors. It was conformationally restricted as 2-methyl-3-(4-phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol, which showed high GluN2B affinity and inhibitory activity. For a better understanding of the relevance of the functional groups and structural elements, the substituents of this 3-benzazepine were removed successively (deconstruction). Then, additional structural elements were introduced (reconstruction) with the aim to analyze, which additional modifications were tolerated by the GluN2B receptor. Methods: The GluN2B affinity was recorded in radioligand receptor binding studies with the radioligand [3H]ifenprodil. The activity of the ligands was determined in twoelectrode voltage clamp experiments using Xenopus laevis oocytes transfected with cRNA encoding the GluN1-1a and GluN2B subunits of the NMDA receptor. Docking studies showed the crucial interactions with the NMDA receptor protein. Results: The deconstruction approach showed that removal of the methyl moiety and the phenolic OH moiety in 7-positon resulted in almost the same GluN2B affinity as the parent 3-benzazepine. A considerably reduced GluN2B affinity was found for the 3-benzazepine without further substituents. However, removal of one or both OH moieties led to considerably reduced NMDA receptor inhibition. Introduction of a NO 2 moiety or bioisosteric replacement of the phenol by a benzoxazolone resulted in comparable GluN2B affinity, but almost complete loss of inhibitory activity. An O-atom, a carbonyl moiety or a F-atom in the tetramethylene spacer led to 6-7-fold reduced ion channel inhibition. Conclusion: The results reveal an uncoupling of affinity and activity for the tested 3-benzazepines. Strong inhibition of [3H]ifenprodil binding by a test compound does not necessarily translate into strong inhibition of the ion flux through the NMDA receptor associated ion channel. 3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine1,7-diol (WMS-1410) shows high GluN2B affinity and strong inhibition of the ion channel. Deconstruction by removal of one or both OH moieties reduced the inhibitory activity proving the importance of the OH groups for ion channel blockade. Reconstruction by introduction of various structural elements into the left benzene ring or into the tetramethylene spacer reduced the NMDA receptor inhibition. It can be concluded that these modifications are not able to translate binding into inhibition. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Cell Physiol Biochem Press GmbH&Co.

Therefore, to address more than one of these, drug discovery programmes focus on the development of multifunctional ligands, preferably with disease-modifying and symptoms-reducing potential. Following this idea, herein we present the design and synthesis of multifunctional ligands and biological evaluation of their 5-HT6 receptor affinity (radioligand binding assay), cholinesterase inhibitory activity (spectroscopic Ellman's assay), antioxidant activity (ABTS assay) and metal-chelating properties, as well as a preliminary ADMET properties evaluation. Based on the results we selected compound 14 as a well-balanced and potent 5-HT6 receptor ligand (K-i = 22 nM) and human BuChE inhibitor (IC50 = 16 nM) with antioxidant potential expressed as a reduction of ABTS radicals by 35% (150 mu M). The study also revealed additional metal-chelating properties of compounds 15 and 18. The presented compounds modulating Alzheimer's disease-related processes might be further developed as multifunctional ligands against the disease.

The Role of Theranostics in Prostate Cancer	SEMINARS IN RADIATION ONCOLOGY			English	Article								Theranostics in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) has been developed to target bone and the tumor itself. Currently, bone-directed targeted alpha therapy with radium-223 (Ra-223) is the only theranostic agent proven to prolong survival in men with mCRPC who have symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastases. The clinical utility and therapeutic success of Ra-223 has encouraged the development of other tumor-targeting theranostic agents in mCRPC, primarily targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) with radioligand therapy (RLT). There is increasing evidence of promising response rates and a low toxicity profile with Lu-177-labeled PSMA RLT in patients with mCRPC. A phase III randomized study of Lu-177-labeled PSMA RLT has completed accrual and is awaiting results as to whether the drug improves radiographic progression free survival and overall survival in men with mCRPC receiving standard of care treatments. Additional early clinical trials are investigating the role of tumor-directed targeted alpha therapy with radiotracers such as Ac-225. In this article, we review the current status of theranostics in prostate cancer, discussing the challenges and opportunities of combination therapies with more conventional agents such as androgen receptor inhibitors, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and immunotherapy.

High Availability of the α7-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor in Brains of Individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Study Using <SUP>18</SUP>F-ASEM PET	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						nAChR; cholinergic; F-18-ASEM; dementia; PET	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; UP-REGULATION; MOUSE MODEL; ACCUMULATION; BINDING; BETA-AMYLOID(1-42); RADIOTRACER; EXPRESSION; NEURONS	Emerging evidence supports a hypothesized role for the alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7-nAChR) in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. F-18-ASEM (3-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-6-F-18-fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide) is a radioligand for estimating the availability of alpha 7-nAChR in the brain in vivo with PET. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 14 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage to dementia, and 17 cognitively intact, elderly controls completed F-18-ASEM PET. For each participant, binding in each region of interest was estimated using Logan graphical analysis with a metabolite-corrected arterial input function. Results: Higher F-18-ASEM binding was observed in MCI patients than in controls across all regions, supporting higher availability of alpha 7-nAChR in MCI. F-18-ASEM binding was not associated with verbal memory in this small MCI sample. Conclusion: These data support use of F-18-ASEM PET to examine further the relationship between alpha 7-nAChR availability and MCI.

Dileep			Radiosynthesis and evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]CMP, a high affinity GSK3 ligand	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						PET; GSK3; Radiotracer; Brain	GLYCOGEN-SYNTHASE KINASE-3; IN-VIVO EVALUATION; PROTEIN-LEVELS; BETA-CATENIN; BRAIN; PET; INHIBITORS; TARGET	Dysfunction of GSK3 is implicated in the etiology of many brain, inflammatory, cardiac diseases, and cancer. PET imaging would enable in vivo detection and quantification of GSK3 and can impact the choice of therapy, allow non-invasive monitoring of disease progression and treatment effects. In this report, the synthesis and evaluation of a high affinity GSK3 ligand, [C-11]2-(cyclopropanecarboxamido)-N-(4-methoxypyridin-3-yeisonicotinamide, ([C-11]CMP, (3), (IC50= 3.4 nM, LogP = 1.1) is described. [C-11]CMP was synthesized in 25 +/- 5% yield by radiomethylating the corresponding phenolate using [C-11]CH3I. The radioligand exhibited modest uptake in U251 human glioblastoma cell lines with similar to 50% specific binding. MicroPET studies in rats indicated negligible blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration of [C-11]CMP, despite its high affinity and suitable logP value for BBB penetration. However, administration of cyclosporine prior to [C-11]CMP injection showed significant improvement in brain radioactivity uptake and the tracer binding. This finding indicates that [C-11]CMP might be a P-gp efflux substrate and therefore has some limitations for routine in vivo PET evaluations in brain.	[Prabhakaran, Jaya; Mann, J. John; Kumar, S.

Recently, the F-18 labeled PET radiotracer [F-18]7a was reported, which shows high CB2 affinity and high selectivity over the CB1 subtype but low metabolic stability due to hydrolysis of the amide group. Based on these findings twelve bioisosteres of 7a were synthesized containing a non-hydrolysable functional group instead of the amide group. The secondary amine 23a (K-i = 7.9 nM) and the ketone 26a (K-i = 8.6 nM) displayed high CB2 affinity and CB2:CB1 selectivity in in vitro radioligand binding studies. Incubation of 7a, 23a and 26a with mouse liver microsomes and LC-quadrupole-MS analysis revealed a slightly higher metabolic stability of secondary amine 23a, but a remarkably higher stability of ketone 26a in comparison to amide 7a. Furthermore, a logD(7.4) value of 5.56 +/- 0.08 was determined for ketone 26a by micro shake-flask method and LC-MS quantification. (C) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Structural Determinants of the γ-8 TARP Dependent AMPA Receptor Antagonist	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Structural modeling; TDAA; stargazin; stargazer; glutamate receptor; ionotropic	IONOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; REGULATORY PROTEIN ISOFORM; 2 DISTINCT MECHANISMS; AUXILIARY SUBUNITS; STARGAZIN; EXPRESSION; FAMILY; HIPPOCAMPAL; DIVERSITY; COMPLEXES	The forebrain specific AMPA receptor antagonist, LY3130481/CERC-611, which selectively antagonizes the AMPA receptors associated with TARP gamma-8, an auxiliary subunit enriched in the forebrain, has potent antiepileptic activities without motor side effects. We designated the compounds with such activities as gamma-8 TARP dependent AMPA receptor antagonists (gamma-8 TDAAs). In this work, we further investigated the mechanisms of action using a radiolabeled gamma-8 TDAA and ternary structural modeling with mutational validations to characterize the LY3130481 binding to gamma-8. The radioligand binding to the cells heterologously expressing GluA1 and/or gamma-8 revealed that gamma-8 TDAAs binds to gamma-8 alone without AMPA receptors. Homology modeling of gamma-8, based on the crystal structures of a distant TARP homologue, murine claudin 19, in conjunction with knowledge of two gamma-8 residues previously identified as critical for the LY3130481 TARP-dependent selectivity provided the basis for a binding mode prediction. This allowed further rational mutational studies for characterization of the structural determinants in TARP gamma-8 for LY3130481 activities, both thermodynamically as well as kinetically.

Allosteric Modulation of Muscarinic Receptors	MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR: FROM STRUCTURE TO ANIMAL MODELS	Neuromethods		English	Article; Book Chapter						Muscarinic receptors; Allosteric modulation; Radioligand binding; Functional response	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; AMINO-ACIDS; POSITIVE COOPERATIVITY; SUBTYPE SELECTIVITY; N-METHYLSCOPOLAMINE; ANTAGONIST BINDING; AGONIST; GALLAMINE; SITE; M-2	Allosteric ligands modulate binding and function of muscarinic receptors in a different way than orthosteric ligands. Unlike orthosteric ligands their effects are limited by a cooperativity factor. This imparts them unique properties, including cooperativity-based selectivity, functional selectivity and restoring of physiological-like space and time pattern of signaling under pathological conditions. Therefore, allosteric modulators of muscarinic receptor are intensively studied as possible therapeutics of pathological conditions including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. Research of allosteric modulation has pioneered the way for a whole class A of G-protein coupled receptors and has had an impact beyond its own field. We review principles of allosteric modulations and their implications for proper design of binding as well as functional experiments and for proper data analysis. We demonstrate immense complexity of allosteric modulation of functional responses. Such complexity is reflected in the inability to determine individual microscopic constants in allosterically modulated systems. Therefore, the effects of a given allosteric modulator can be characterized by only two macroscopic parameters, namely a change in the agonist potency and efficacy. We also discuss distinct properties of allosteric interactions that are specific to muscarinic receptors.

Cyclic ovarian hormone modulation of supraspinal Δ<SUP>9</SUP>-tetrahydrocannabinol-induced antinociception and cannabinoid receptor binding in the female rat	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Hormone; Female; Cannabinoid; Antinociception; Locomotion; Radioligand binding	SEX-DIFFERENCES; DOPAMINERGIC ACTIVITY; ESTROUS-CYCLE; BRAIN; CB1; DELTA-9-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; NEURONS; 17-BETA-ESTRADIOL; INHIBITION; ANALGESIA	Estrous cycle-related fluctuations in delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-induced antinociception have been observed in the rat. The aim of this study was to determine which major ovarian hormone modulates the antinociceptive effects of i.c.v. THC, and whether hormone modulation of TI-IC's behavioral effects could be due to changes in brain cannabinoid receptors (CBr). Vehicle (oil) or hormones (estradiol or progesterone, or both) were administered to female rats on days 3 and 7 post-ovariectomy. On the morning or afternoon of day 8 or day 9, vehicle or THC (100 mu g) was administered i.c.v. Paw pressure, tail withdrawal, locomotor activity and catalepsy tests were conducted over a 3-h period. Estradiol (with and without progesterone) enhanced THC-induced paw pressure antinociception only. Ovarian hormones time-dependently modulated CBr in brain structures that mediate antinociception and locomotor activity, but the changes observed in CBr did not parallel changes in behavior. However, the time course of CBr changes must be further elucidated to determine the functional relationship between receptor changes and antinociceptive sensitivity to THC (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Stroke was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in Balb/c mice. Dynamic PET/CT imaging with displacement and preblocking using PK111195 was performed 3 days later. PET data were correlated with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the activated microglial markers TSPO and CD68 and with autoradiography. [F-18]PBR06 accumulation peaked within the first 5 min postinjection, then decreased gradually, remaining significantly higher in infarct compared to noninfarct regions. Displacement or preblocking with PK11195 eliminated the difference in [F-18]PBR06 uptake between infarct and noninfarct regions. Autoradiography and IHC correlated well spatially with uptake on PET. [F-18]PBR06 PET specifically images TSPO in microglial neuroinflammation in a mouse model of stroke and shows promise for imaging and monitoring microglial activation/neuroinflammation in other disease models.

We have also evaluated the radiochemical stability in an ethanol-free solution of [18F]AV-45 under visible light irradiation and dark conditions by comparison with a conventional 10% ethanol solution of [18F]AV-45. [18F]AV-45 was obtained with a radiochemical yield of 55.1 +/- 2.2% (decay-corrected to end of bombardment), specific activity of 591.6 +/- 90.3GBq/mu mol and radiochemical purity of >99% within a total synthesis time of about 73min. The radiochemical purity of [18F]AV-45 formulated by dissolving the ethanol-free solution was found to decrease as a function of the period of exposure to visible light. In contrast, the visible light photolysis could be suppressed by adding 10% ethanol to the formulation or by avoiding exposure to visible light. In the radiosynthesis of [18F]AV-45 formulated by dissolving the ethanol-free solution, [18F]AV-45 could be obtained with high radiochemical purity and high stability by avoiding exposure to visible light.

Truncated (N)-Methanocarba Nucleosides as A<sub>1</sub> Adenosine Receptor Agonists and Partial Agonists: Overcoming Lack of a Recognition Element	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptor; purines; molecular modeling; radioligand binding; adenylate cyclase	DERIVATIVES; LIGANDS; ANTAGONISTS; ACTIVATION; EFFICACY	A(1) adenosine receptor (AR) agonists are neuroprotective, cardioprotective, and anxiolytic. (N)-Methanocarba adenine nucleosides designed to bind to human A(1)AR were truncated to eliminate 5'-CH2OH. This modification previously converted A(3)AR agonists into antagonists, but the comparable effect at A(1)AR is unknown. In comparison to ribosides, affinity at the A(1)AR was less well preserved than that at the A(3)AR, although a few derivatives were moderately A(1)AR selective, notably full agonist 21 (N-6-dicyclopropyl-methyl, K-i 47.9 nM). Thus, at the A(1)AR, recognition elements for nucleoside binding depend more on 5' region interactions, and in their absence, A(3)AR selectivity predominates. Based on the recently reported agonist-bound AR structure, this difference between subtypes likely correlates with an essential His residue in transmembrane domain 6 of A(1) but not A(3)AR The derivatives ranged from partial to full agonists in A(1)AR-mediated adenylate cyclase inhibition. Truncated derivatives have more druglike physical properties than other A(1)AR agonists; this approach is appealing for preclinical development.

A previously reported promising radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) based on the non-peptide ETA receptor antagonist PD 156707 showed specific binding to target receptors in the myocardium but high accumulation in bile and intestine, probably because of its high lipophilicity. In this study we describe the synthesis of a series of fluorinated derivatives with hydrophilic building blocks. All compounds were evaluated as high affinity ETA receptor ligands (16, 17, 23-26, K(I); = 1.4-7.9 nM) with high subtype selectivity over the ET(B) receptor.

From this preliminary study the conclusion can be drawn that introduction of bulky chains at the N-6 position of 9-propyladenine significantly increased binding affinity at the human A(1) and A(3) adenosine receptors, while the presence of a chlorine atom at the 2 position resulted in a not univocal effect, depending on the receptor subtype and/or on the substituent present in the N-6 position. However, in all cases, the presence in the 2 position of a chlorine atom favoured the interaction with the A(2A) subtype. These results demonstrated that, although the synthesized compounds were found to be quite inactive at the human A(2B) subtype, adenine is a useful template for further development of simplified adenosine receptor antagonists with distinct receptor selectivity profiles.

This study evaluated one class of A(2A)AR antagonists, derivatives of 4-amino-6-benzylamino- 1,2-dihydro-2-phenyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-2H-1-one, 10a, as agents for imaging brain A(2A)ARs by PET.. Modifications of a literature synthesis of 10a efficiently generated analogs 10b-s for pharmacological evaluation. Radioligand binding experiments showed affinities for the rat brain A(2A)AR in the low nanomolar range but similar affinities for the A(1)AR and substantial unspecific binding.

We report an optimized synthesis resulting in an uncorrected yield of 58% in 45 min (precursor 2), enabling efficient production intended for clinical use. Incubation of normal rat brain sections with 2-[F-18]F-A85380 with subsequent autoradiographic analyses showed the expected distribution in nAChR areas. In human brain sections of Alzheimer's disease (AD) a decrease of 2-[F-18]F-A85380 uptake to 36% of the control group was measured in the thalamus and also in the occipital cortex. These findings suggest that 2-[F-18]F-A85380 is a promising PET-ligand in the diagnosis of AD. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In order to improve the affinity and chemical stability of endomorphins, we have designed, synthesized, and characterized novel analogs with unnatural (2', 6'-dimethyltyrosine, Dmt) and/or beta-alicyclic amino acids (ACPC and ACHC). Radioligand binding assay indicated that several of the novel analogs exhibit high affinity for both mu- and delta-opioid receptors in rat- or mouse-brain membrane preparations. The most promising derivatives-such as Dmt-Pro-Trp/Phe-Phe-NH2. Dmt-(1S,2R)-ACPC-Phe-Phe-NH2, and Dmt-(1S,2R)-ACHC-Phe-Phe-NH2)-were characterized in recombinant cell lines expressing human mu- or delta-opioid receptors. Interestingly, while these novel peptides were potent opioid agonists in the functional [S-35]GTPgammaS binding assays in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the mu-opioid receptors, some behaved as antagonist or inverse agonist in the human delta-opioid receptor-expressing CHO cells. Since it has previously been demonstrated that the coadministration of delta-antagonists with mu-analgesics attenuates the development of analgesic tolerance, introduction of high-affinity delta-antagonist properties into the mu-agonist endomorphins is expected to lead to potent analgesics that produce limited tolerance.

Male Sprague Dawley rats were either isolated (1 per cage) or grouped (3 per cage) for 7 days. Isolated rats exhibited increased blood pressure (systolic blood pressure 159.7 +/- 6.6 mmHg) whereas the grouped rats remained normotensive (systolic blood pressure 137 +/- 6.3 mmHg). Using radioligand binding techniques we observed a significant increase in kappa opioid receptor binding in the hippocampus of isolated rats (56% increase) and this further increased when the length of isolation was increased to 2 weeks (72% increase). Radioimmunoassay showed that isolation decreased the hippocampal content of Dyn A (1-8) from 12.7 +/- 0.4 to 11.6 +/- 0.2 pg Dyn A (1-8) per 10 mg tissue (rats weighing approximately 100 g) and from 13.3 +/- 0.8 to 9.7 +/- 1 pg Dyn A (1-8) per 10 mg tissue (approximately 200 g rats). These data suggest that functional alterations in the hippocampal dynorphin system may be involved in the maintenance of isolation induced hypertension. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

We compared the biodistribution in subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice of PSMA-TO-1, PSMA-617 and PSMA-11 when labeled with Ga-68 and Lu-177, and the survival after treatment with Ac-225-PSMA-TO-1/-617 in a murine model of disseminated prostate cancer. We also report dosimetry data of Lu-177-PSMA-TO1/-617 in prostate cancer patients. Methods First, PET images of Ga-68-PSMA-TO-1/-617/-11 were acquired on consecutive days in three mice bearing subcutaneous C4-2 xenografts. Second, 50 subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice received either 30 MBq of Lu-177-PSMA-617 or Lu-177-PSMA-TO-1 and were sacrificed at 1, 4, 24, 48 and 168 h for ex vivo gamma counting and biodistribution. Third, mice bearing disseminated lesions via intracardiac inoculation were treated with either 40 kBq of Ac-225-PSMA-617, Ac-225-PSMA-TO-1, or remained untreated and followed for survival. Additionally, 3 metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients received 500 MBq of Lu-177-PSMA-TO-1 under compassionate use for dosimetry purposes. Planar images with an additional SPECT/CT acquisition were acquired for dosimetry calculations. Results Tumor uptake measured by PET imaging of Ga-68-labeled agents in mice was highest using PSMA-617, followed by PSMA-TO-1 and PSMA-11. Lu-177-PSMA tumor uptake measured by ex vivo gamma counting at subsequent time points tended to be greater for PSMA-TO-1 up to 1 week following treatment (p > 0.13 at all time points). This was, however, accompanied by increased kidney uptake and a 26-fold higher kidney dose of PSMA-TO-1 compared with PSMA-617 in mice. Mice treated with a single-cycle Ac-225-PSMA-TO-1 survived longer than those treated with Ac-225-PSMA-617 and untreated mice, respectively (17.8, 14.5 and 7.7 weeks, respectively; p < 0.0001). Kidney, salivary gland, bone marrow and mean +/- SD tumor dose coefficients (Gy/GBq) for Lu-177-PSMA-TO-1 in patients #01/#02/#03 were 2.5/2.4/3.0, 1.0/2.5/2.3, 0.14/0.11/0.10 and 0.42 +/- 0.03/4.45 +/- 0.07/1.8 +/- 0.57, respectively. Conclusions PSMA-TO-1 tumor uptake tended to be greater than that of PSMA-617 in both preclinical and clinical settings. Mice treated with Ac-225-PSMA-TO-1 conferred a significant survival benefit compared to Ac-225-PSMA-617 despite the accompanying increased kidney uptake. In humans, PSMA-TO-1 dosimetry estimates suggest increased tumor absorbed doses; however, the kidneys, salivary glands and bone marrow are also exposed to higher radiation doses. Thus, additional preclinical studies are needed before further clinical use.

We recently reported on a covalently binding noradrenaline analog (FAUC37) facilitating crystallization of the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2ARH2.64C) in an active state. We herein present the stereospecific synthesis of covalently binding disulfide ligands based on the pharmacophores of adrenergic beta 1-and beta 2 receptor antagonists. Radioligand depletion experiments revealed that the disulfide-functionalized ligands were able to rapidly form a covalent bond with a specific cysteine residue of the receptor mutants beta 1ARI2.64C and beta 2ARH2.64C. The propranolol derivative (S)-1a induced nearly complete irreversible blockage of the beta 2ARH2.64C within 30 min incubation. The CGP20712A-based ligand (S)-4 showed efficient covalent blocking of the beta 2ARH2.64C at very low concentrations. The analog (S)-5a revealed extraordinary covalent cross-linking at the beta 1ARI2.64C and beta 2ARH2.64C mutant while retaining a 41-fold selectivity for the beta 1AR wild type over beta 2AR. These compounds may serve as valuable molecular tools for studying beta 1/beta 2 subtype selectivity or investigations on GPCR trafficking and dimerization.

In the present report, we used [I-125]-CLINDE, a SPECT TSPO radiotracer never before used in AD, and we investigated the relationship between TSPO and amyloid plaque density (using [I-125]-DRM106) in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTgAD, APP(SWE), PS1(M146V) and Tau(P301L)). Our results show that TSPO increases appear before those of amyloid deposits. Moreover, the different parts of the hippo campus are differentially affected. Indeed, for both TSPO and amyloid, the subiculum is affected earlier and the ventral hippocampus later than the dorsal hippocampus. In the subiculum and the dorsal hippocampus of 3xTgAD mice, a positive correlation between TSPO and of amyloid deposit levels is observed. This data supports the hypothesis that TSPO could be used as a predictive marker of amyloid pathology. In addition, our immunohistochemical data shows a segregation of TSPO in the hippocampus and immunofluorescence imaging revealed a mainly microglial origin of the TSPO expression. Thus, imaging TSPO with CLINDE may be a good alternative to PET radiotracers.

Methods Patients with secondary progressive MS (n = 10) or relapsing-remitting MS (n = 10) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 17) were studied. Microglial activation was measured using PET and radioligand [C-11](R)-PK11195. Clinical assessment and structural and quantitative MRI including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed for comparison. Results [C-11](R)-PK11195 binding was significantly higher in the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) of patients with secondary progressive vs relapsing MS and healthy controls, in the thalami of patients with secondary progressive MS vs controls, and in the perilesional area among the progressive compared with relapsing patients. Higher binding in the NAWM was associated with higher clinical disability and reduced white matter (WM) structural integrity, as shown by lower fractional anisotropy, higher mean diffusivity, and increased WM lesion load. Increasing age contributed to higher microglial activation in the NAWM among patients with MS but not in healthy controls. Conclusions PET can be used to quantitate microglial activation, which associates with MS progression. This study demonstrates that increased microglial activity in the NAWM correlates closely with impaired WM structural integrity and thus offers one rational pathologic correlate to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters.

One of the main drivers of the neuroinflammatory process are microglial cells. Positron Emission Tomography allows for the quantification of microglial activation by labelling the Translocator Protein 18 kDa (TSPO), which becomes overexpressed upon activation of microglial cells. Several radioligands have been designed to target TSPO and have been studied in-vivo in AD populations. While most studies have shown important increases in TSPO binding in AD populations compared to healthy volunteers, whether the neuroinflammatory progress occurs early on or later during disease is still unclear. In order to investigate the early changes in neuroinflammation, studies have sought to investigate microglial activation in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is defined as a transitional stage between normal aging and dementia. In this prodromal population, conflicting results have been reported with some studies reporting increased binding in MCI, while others demonstrate no differences from controls. Here we review the TSPO PET studies in AD and MCI populations and discuss the important methodological considerations of imaging microglial activation.

The alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenorecepor affinities of the new pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives were determined using a radioligand binding assay. The most active compound was then tested in vitro for intrinsic activity toward alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors and in vitro for antiarrhythmic activity in epinephrine-induced arrhythmia in rats. The highest affinity for the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor (pK(i) = 7.01) was displayed by 1-{4-[4-(2-methoxy-5-chlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-methyl}-pyrrolidin-2-one (9). 1-[4-(2-Fluorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one (7) showed the highest affinity toward the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor (pK(i) = 6.52). Intrinsic activity studies of compound 9 showed that this compound is an antagonist of both alpha(1A)-(EC50 = 0.5 nM) and alpha(1B)-(EC50 = 51.0 nM) adrenoceptors. Compound 9 displayed antiarrhythmic activity in rats (ED50 = 5.0 mg/kg (3.13-7.99)). New derivatives of pyrrolidin-2-one with alpha(1)-adrenoceptor affinity were identified. We propose that the antiarrhythmic activity of compound 9 is related to its antagonism of alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors.

We have developed binary quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for 5-HT1A binding using data retrieved from the WOMBAT database and the k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) machine learning method. A rigorous QSAR modeling and screening workflow had been followed, with extensive internal and external validation processes. The models' classification accuracies to discriminate 5-HT1A binders from the non-binders are as high as 96% for the external validation. These models were employed further to mine two major natural products screening libraries, i.e. TimTec Natural Product Library (NPL) and Natural Derivatives Library (NDL). In the end five screening hits were tested by radioligand binding assays with a success rate of 40%, and two Library compounds were confirmed to be binders at the mu M concentration against the human 5-HT1A receptor. The combined application of rigorous QSAR modeling and model-based virtual screening presents a powerful means for profiling natural products compounds with important biomedical activities.

Synthesis, Anti-hypertensive Effect of a Novel Angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> Receptor Antagonist and its Anti-tumor Activity in Prostate Cancer	ARZNEIMITTELFORSCHUNG-DRUG RESEARCH			English	Article						angiotensin II; AT(1) receptor; synthesis; hypertension; prostate; cancer	GROWTH; EXPRESSION	Since the first non-peptide Ang II receptor antagonist was originally reported, it has become the most common target in the development of new treatments for hypertension. In recent years, all components of the classical RAS have been reported in the prostate, these results suggest the possibility that ARB is a novel therapeutic class of agents for prostate cancer. In this study, a new compound 2-(4-((2-propyl-5-nitro-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-1-yl) methyl)-1H-indol-1-yl) benzoic acid was synthesized and evaluated as a novel angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antagonist by radioligand binding assays, anti-hypertensive assays in vivo and oral acute toxicity test. MTT assays and tests in nude mice were used to demonstrate its anti-tumor activity. This new compound showed high affinity to AT(1) receptor and anti-hypertensive activity in spontaneously hypertensive rats and renal hypertensive rats. Moreover, in human prostate cancer cells and in athymic nude mice bearing human prostate cancer cells, we observed this new compound had an efficient antiproliferative activity in vitro and anti-tumor activity in vivo. The preliminary pharmacological characteristics with oral acute toxicity test suggested that this new compound can be considered as a candidate for both anti-hypertensive and antitumor drug.

In the present study, a previous sigma receptor ligand, CM156, was optimized for metabolic stability, and the lead analog was evaluated against the behavioral effects of methamphetamine. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated that the lead analog, AZ66, displayed high nanomolar affinity for both sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors (2.4 +/- 0.63 and 0.51 +/- 0.15, respectively). In addition, AZ66 had preferential affinity for sigma receptors compared to seven other sites and a significantly longer half-life than its predecessor, CM156, in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment of male, Swiss Webster mice with intraperitoneal (10-20 mg/kg) or oral (20-30 mg/kg) dosing of AZ66 significantly attenuated the acute locomotor stimulatory effects of methamphetamine. Additionally, AZ66 (10-20 mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the expression and development of behavioral sensitization induced by repeated methamphetamine administration. Taken together, these data indicate that sigma receptors can be targeted to mitigate the acute and subchronic behavioral effects of methamphetamine and AZ66 represents a viable lead compound in the development of novel therapeutics against methamphetamine-induced behaviors.

One scientific challenge in molecular imprinting research is to understand the intermolecular interactions leading to molecular complexation and the process of binding site formation during polymerization. In this work, we present a novel method for studying the molecular imprinting process in precipitation polymerization systems. This method employs solution H-1 NMR and dynamic light scattering (DLS) to investigate the association of template molecules with colloidal particles and the dynamic process of particle growth. Under precipitation polymerization conditions, the colloidal particles formed did not interfere with NMR signals from the soluble components, allowing unreacted monomers and free template to be easily quantified. To examine the process of particle nucleation and growth, DLS was used to measure the hydrodynamic particle size at different reaction times. To corroborate the interpretation of the NMR and DLS results, imprinted nanoparticles were collected at different reaction times and their binding characteristics were evaluated using radioligand-binding analysis. Our experimental results provide new insights into the molecular imprinting process that will be useful in the development of new imprinted nanoparticles. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Dynamic PET Denoising with HYPR Processing	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumentation; molecular imaging; PET; denoising; dynamic positron emission tomography; parametric images	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IMAGE-RECONSTRUCTION; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; NEURORECEPTOR; RADIOLIGAND; PARAMETER; KINETICS; BINDING	HighlY constrained backPRojection (HYPR) is a promising image-processing strategy with widespread application in time-resolved MRI that is also well suited for PET applications requiring time series data. The HYPR technique involves the creation of a composite image from the entire time series. The individual time frames then provide the basis for weighting matrices of the composite. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the individual time frames can be dramatically improved using the high SNR of the composite image. In this study, we introduced the modified HYPR algorithm (the HYPR method constraining the backprojections to local regions of interest [HYPR-LR]) for the processing of dynamic PET studies. We demonstrated the performance of HYPR-LR in phantom, small-animal, and human studies using qualitative, semiquantitative, and quantitative comparisons. The results demonstrate that significant improvements in SNR can be realized in the PET time series, particularly for voxel-based analysis, without sacrificing spatial resolution. HYPR-LR processing holds great potential in nuclear medicine imaging for all applications with low SNR in dynamic scans, including for the generation of voxel-based parametric images and visualization of rapid radiotracer uptake and distribution. Key Words: instrumentation; molecular imaging; PET; denoising; dynamic positron emission tomography; parametric images and visualization of rapid radiotracer uptake and distribution.

Correction of head movement on PET studies: Comparison of methods	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; C-11-raclopride; movement; test-retest; striatum	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SPATIAL NORMALIZATION; MOTION CORRECTION; IMAGES; TRANSMISSION; OPTIMIZATION	Head movement presents a continuing problem in PET studies. Head restraint minimizes movement but is unreliable, resulting in the need to develop alternative strategies. These include frame-by-frame (FBF) realignment or use of motion tracking (MT) during the scan to realign PET acquisition data. Here we present a comparative analysis of these 2 methods of motion correction. Methods: Eight volunteers were examined at rest using C-11-raclopride PET with the radioligand administered as a bolus followed by constant infusion to achieve steady state. Binding potential (BP) was estimated using the ratio method during 2 periods of the scan at steady state. Head movement was compensated by using coregistration between frames (FBF) and 3 methods using MT measurements of head position acquired with a commercially available optical tracking system. Results: All methods of realignment improved test-retest reliability and noise characteristics of the raw data, with important consequences for the power to detect small changes in radio-tracer binding, and the potential to reduce false-positive and false-negative results. MT methods were superior to FBF realignment using coregistration on some indices. Conclusion: Such methods have considerable potential to improve the reliability of PET data with important implications for the numbers of volunteers required to test hypotheses.

All receptors were characterized in radioligand binding experiments, the wild-type and the Gly (14)Thr mutant receptor in greater detail. Both receptors were allosterically modulated by sodium ions and PD81,723 (2-amino-4,5dimethyl-3-thienyl-[3(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]methanone), although in a different way. All mutant receptors appeared to be spontaneously or "constitutively" active in a [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assay, the first demonstration of the existence of such CAM (constitutively active mutant) receptors for the adenosine A, receptor. The Gly (14)Thr mutant receptor was also constitutively active in another functional assay, i.e., the inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP production in intact cells. Importantly, this mutant displayed a peculiar "locked-on" phenotype, i.e., neither agonist nor inverse agonist was capable of modulating the basal activity in both the GTP-yS and the cAMP assay, unlike the wild-type and the two other mutant receptors.

In mouse, radiant heat tail-flick assay [Dmt(1)]DALDA produced profound spinal and supraspinal analgesia, being approximately 5000- and 100-fold more potent than morphine on a molar basis, respectively. When administered systemically, [Dmt(1)]DALDA was over 200-fold more potent than morphine. Pharmacologically, [Dmt(1)]DALDA was distinct from morphine. [Dmt(1)]DALDA displayed no cross-tolerance to morphine in the model used and it retained supraspinal analgesic activity in morphine-insensitive CXBK mice. Supraspinally, it also differed from morphine in its lack of sensitivity towards naloxonazine. Finally, in antisense mapping studies, [Dmt(1)]DALDA was insensitive to MOR-1 exon probes that reduced morphine analgesia, implying a distinct receptor mechanism of action. Thus, [Dmt(1)]DALDA is an interesting and extraordinarily potent, systemically active peptide analgesic, raising the possibility of novel approaches in the design of clinically useful drugs.

Therefore, there is increasing interest in developing antioxidative strategies to avoid or reduce neurodegeneration. We have previously described that different beer extracts modulate ARs and protect glioma and neuroblastoma cells from oxidative stress. The present work aimed to analyze the possible protective effect of hops (Humulus lupulus L.), a major component of beer, and xanthohumol on cell death elicited by oxidative stress and their modulation of ARs in rat C6 glioma and human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Different extraction methods were employed in two hops varieties (Nugget and Columbus). Cell viability was determined by the XTT method in cells exposed to these hops extracts and xanthohumol. ARs were analyzed by radioligand binding and real-time PCR assays. Hops extract reverted the cell death observed under oxidative stress and modulated adenosine A(1) and A(2) receptors in both cell types. Xanthohumol was unable to revert the effect of oxidative stress in cell viability but it also modulated ARs similarly to hops. Therefore, healthy effects of beer described previously could be due, at least in part, to their content of hops and the modulation of ARs.

Fifty-eight older adults were stratified by amyloid and cognitive status based on F-18-florbetaben PET, history, and neuropsychological testing. Of these, 57 had C-11-PBR28 PET to measure microglial activation and 43 had F-18-MK-6240 PET to measure tau pathology. Amyloid and cognitive status were associated with increased overall binding for both C-11-PBR28 and 18 F-MK-6240 (p's < 0.01). While there was no interaction between amyloid and cognitive status in their association with C-11-PBR28 binding (p = 0.6722), there was an interaction in their association with F-18-MK-6240 binding (p = 0.0115). Binding of both radioligands was greater in amyloid-positive controls than in amyloid-negative controls; however, this difference was seen in neocortical regions for C-11-PBR28 and only in medial temporal cortex for F-18-MK-6240. We conclude that, in the absence of cognitive symptoms, amyloid deposition has a greater association with microglial activation than with tau pathology. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

[F-18]MK-6240 was synthesized in one step from its bis-Boc protected precursor N-[(tert-butoxy)carbonyl]-N-(6-nitro-3-[1H-pyrrolo[2,3-c]pyridin-1-yl]isoquinolin-5-yl) carbamate in DMSO using [F-18] fluoride with TEA HCO3 with step-wise heating up to 150 degrees C, resulting in an isolated radiochemical yield of 9.8% +/- 1.8% (n = 3) calculated from the end of bombardment (5.2% +/- 1.0% calculated from the end of synthesis). This new synthetic approach eliminates the acidic deprotection of the bis-Boc F-18-labeled intermediate, which reduces the number of operations necessary for the synthesis as well as losses, which occur during deprotection and neutralization of the crude product mixture prior to the HPLC purification. The synthesis was performed automatically with a single-use cassette on an IBA Synthera+ synthesis module.

The corresponding radiotracer [F-18]10 demonstrated high brain uptake and extremely high brain-to-blood ratios in biodistribution studies in mice. Pretreatment with the selective sigma(1) receptor agonist SA4503- significantly reduced the level of accumulation of the radiotracer in the brain. No radiometabolite of [F-18]10 was observed to enter the brain. Positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed suitable kinetics and a high, specific binding of [F-18]10 to sigma(1) receptors in rat brain. Ex vivo autoradiography showed a reduced level of binding of [F-18]10 in the cortex and hippocampus of the senescence-accelerated prone (SAMP8) compared to that of the senescence-accelerated resistant (SAMR1) mite, indicating the potential dysfunction of sigma(1) receptors in Alzheimer's disease.

Dopamine D<sub>3</sub> Receptor Availability Is Associated with Inflexible Decision Making	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						addiction; computational analyses; decision-making; dopamine D-3 receptors; PET; reinforcement learning	ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; D2 RECEPTORS; D3 RECEPTORS; REVERSAL; METHAMPHETAMINE; COCAINE; BRAIN; DISCRIMINATION; RATS; SENSITIVITY	Dopamine D-2/3 receptor signaling is critical for flexible adaptive behavior; however, it is unclear whether D-2, D-3, or both receptor subtypes modulate precise signals of feedback and reward history that underlie optimal decision making. Here, PET with the radioligand [C-11]-(+)-PHNO was used to quantify individual differences in putative D-3 receptor availability in rodents trained on a novel three-choice spatial acquisition and reversal-learning task with probabilistic reinforcement. Binding of [C-11]-(+)-PHNO in the midbrain was negatively related to the ability of rats to adapt to changes in rewarded locations, but not to the initial learning. Computational modeling of choice behavior in the reversal phase indicated that [C-11]-(+)-PHNO binding in the midbrain was related to the learning rate and sensitivity to positive, but not negative, feedback. Administration of a D-3-preferring agonist likewise impaired reversal performance by reducing the learning rate and sensitivity to positive feedback. These results demonstrate a previously unrecognized role for D-3 receptors in select aspects of reinforcement learning and suggest that individual variation in midbrain D-3 receptors influences flexible behavior. Our combined neuroimaging, behavioral, pharmacological, and computational approach implicates the dopamine D3 receptor in decision-making processes that are altered in psychiatric disorders.

The effects of prolonged flumazenil treatment were studied on recombinant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2S) GABA(A) receptors stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells. Using radioligand binding experiments we found enhancement in the maximum number of [H-3]muscimol labeled binding sites in different preparations of HEK 293 cells. The parallel increase of[3 H]flunitrazepam binding sites in the membranes was reduced in the presence of actinomycin D and cycloheximide, inhibitors of RNA and protein synthesis, respectively. Chronic flumazenil also raised the steady-state level of mRNA encoding a, receptor subunit. The results suggest that the up-regulation of GABAA receptors, observed after prolonged flumazenil treatment is at least partly due to increased de novo synthesis of receptor proteins at both transcriptional and translational level.

The radioligand was distributed with an high degree of anatomical selectivity. We found abundant labelling in the cerebellum, in the nucleus diffusus lobi inferioris, and in the torus longitudinalis. No labelling was detected within the epithalamus, thalamus and hypothalamus, while the telencephalon and the rhombencephalon displayed a low density of [H-3]muscimol receptors sites. Binding assay showed the highest concentration of receptor sites in the nucleus diffusus lobi inferioris and the lowest in the medulla oblongata. Presence of [H-3]muscimol binding sites within the visceral sensory area was noted. The rank order of displacement efficacy of unlabelled ligands observed, suggested that in brain membranes of carp the receptor binding of [H-3]muscimol has the same pharmacological specificity previously reported in a large number of experiments with tissue homogenates. A general agreement in binding and autoradiography was observed. The present findings suggested that muscimol receptor could be involved in neuronal pathway controlling basic central actions like gustatory signal processing or spatial learning acquisition and retention.

Recently, a new SPECT ligand to the presynaptic dopamine transporter (DAT) was introduced. Association of DAT availability and the acute psychotic syndrome is now demonstrated in a large cohort of first episode, never treated schizophrenic patients. Methods:Twenty-eight inpatients suffering from a first acute exacerbation of schizophrenia and 12 healthy control subjects underwent SPECT scanning with the new radioligand [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1. On the day of SPECT, psychopathology was assessed using specific scales including PANSS. Results:There was no significant difference in [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 specific binding to the striatal DAT comparing both groups. The extend of hallucinations was significantly inversely correlated with DAT availability in patients with a predominantly positive syndrome type. Our data support evidence that differences in presynaptic dopaminergic activity in schizophrenic patients are associated with the extend of the acute psychotic syndrome. [Tc-99m]TRODAT-1 seems to be a useful agent for in vivo assessment of a psychopathological association with dopamine metabolism.

Secondly, the sensitivity of the method to detect gradual differences in receptor densities is evaluated. Methods: Positron emission tomography (PET) studies were carried out in 6 healthy volunteers using the selective serotonin-5HT(2A) ligand F-18-altanserin. The binding potential was quantified in 12 regions using Logan's graphical method and the equilibrium method. These data were compared to the distribution of receptor density as taken from literature. Results: The binding data in vivo correlated to autoradiography data (post mortem) with r = 0.83 (Pearson regression coefficient, p <0.0001). A difference in the receptor density between two regions could be detected with p <0.05 when it amounted at least to 18%. Conclusion: This study demonstrates a good agreement between in vivo data obtained with 18F-altanserin and PET in healthy volunteers and the true autoradiographically determined distribution of 5HT(2A) receptors in human brains. The in vivo method seems to be sensitive enough to detect changes in receptor density of more than 18%.

We examined time- and cell-type-dependent changes in endothelin (ET)-1-like immunoreactivity, ET receptors binding and nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) activity in CA1 subfields of the hippocampus of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats subjected to a 10-min bilateral carotid occlusion and reperfusion. 2. Microglia aggregated in accord with neuronal death and expressed a high density of ETB receptors and an intense NOS activity in the damaged CA1 pyramidal cell layer, 7 days after the induced transient forebrain ischemia. The increased NOS activity and ETB receptor in microglia disappeared 28 days after this transient ischemia. 3. In contrast to microglia, astrocytes presented a moderate level of ET-1-like immunoreactivity, ETB receptors, and NOS activity in all areas of the damaged CA1 subfields, 7 days after the ischemia. These events were further enhanced 28 days after the ischemia. 4. In light of these findings, the possibility that the microglial and the astrocytic ETB/ NO system largely contributes to development of the neuronal death and to reconstitution of the damaged neuronal tissue, respectively, in the hippocampus subjected to a transient forebrain ischemia would have to be considered.

Therefore, early and precise diagnosis is critical to improving GC prognosis. Tumor-associated myeloid cells infiltrate the tumor microenvironment (TME) and can produce immunosuppressive effects in the early stage of the tumor. The surface integrin receptor CD11b is widely expressed in the specific subsets of myeloid cells, and it has the characteristics of high abundance, high specificity, and high potential for targeted immunotherapy. In this study, two strategies for labeling antiCD11b, including Zr-89-DFO-anti-CD11b and pretargeted imaging (Ga-68- NOTA-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz/anti- CD11b-TCO), were used to evaluate the value of early diagnosis of GC and confirm the advantages of the pretargeted strategy for the diagnosis of GC. Pretargeted molecular probe Ga-68-NOTA-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz was synthesized. The binding affinity of the Tz-radioligand to CD11b was evaluated in vitro, and its blood pharmacokinetic test was performed in vivo. Moreover, the anti-CD11b antibody was conjugated with a p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (SCN-DFO) chelator and radiolabeled with zirconium-89. Biodistribution and positron-emission computed tomography imaging experiments were performed in MGC-803 tumor-bearing model mice to evaluate the value of the early diagnosis of GC. Histological evaluation of MGC-803 tumors was conducted to confirm the infiltration of the GC TME with CD11b(+) myeloid cells. Ga-68-NOTA-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz was successfully radiosynthesized, with the radiochemical purity above 95%, as confirmed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The radioligand showed favorable stability in normal saline and phosphate-buffered saline, good affinity to RAW264.7 cells, and rapid blood clearance in mice. The results of biodistribution and imaging experiments using the pretargeted method showed that the tumor/muscle ratios were 5.17 +/- 2.98, 5.94 +/- 1.46, and 4.46 +/- 2.73 at the pretargeting intervals of 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. The experimental results using the method of the directly labeling antibody (Zr-89-DFO-anti-CD(11)b) showed that, despite radioactive accumulation in the tumor, there was a higher level of radioactive accumulation in normal tissues. The tumor/muscle ratios were 1.09 +/- 0.67, 1.66 +/- 0.95, 2.94 +/- 1.24, 3.64 +/- 1.21, and 3.55 +/- 1.64 at 1, 24, 48, 72, and 120 h. The current research proved the value of Ga-68-NOTA-polypeptide-PEG(11)-Tz/anti-CD(11)b-TCO in the diagnosis of GC using the pretargeted strategy. Compared to Zr-89-DFO-anti-CD11b, the image contrast achieved by the pretargeted strategy was relatively improved, and the background accumulation of the probe was relatively low. These advantages can improve the diagnostic efficiency for GC and provide supporting evidence for radioimmunotherapy targeting CD11b receptors.

In the present study, we examined the characteristics of DTF binding to native nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in the American cockroach Periplaneta americana using radioligand-binding methods. The Scatchard analysis, using [H-3]imidacloprid (IMI), indicated that IMI has a single class of high-affinity binding sites in the P. americana nerve cord. In contrast, the Scatchard analysis using [H-3]DTF indicated that DTF has two different classes of binding sites. Both DTF and IMI were found to bind to one of the classes, for which DTF showed low affinity. The other class, for which DTF showed high affinity, was localized in the abdominal nerve cord but not in the thoracic nerve cord. IMI showed low affinity for the high-affinity DTF binding sites. Our data suggest that DTF binds with high affinity to a nAChR subtype distinct from the high-affinity subtype for IMI. This difference might be responsible, at least in part, for the difference in resistance development to DTF and IMI in P. americana.

We also used radioligand binding assays to determine the affinities towards 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors and performed molecular docking studies to rationalize obtained results. Among the evaluated compounds seven displayed high affinity to the 5-HT1A (3a-1.3 nM, 5a-1.6 nM, 10a-1.6 nM, 11a-1.0 nM, 3b-1.0 nM, 5b-0.8 nM and 11b-1.5 nM) as well as significant 5-HT1A antagonist profiles. The equilibrium dissociation constant values of tested compounds shown differential intrinsic activity (3a-190 nM, 3b-28 nM, 5a-48 nM, 5b-23 nM,10b-180 nM, 11a-99 nM,11b-38 nM) of antagonist mode. Molecular docking studies using a homology model of 5-HT1A revealed that ligand 5b is stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds to Ser190. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Here, we examine the binding of 1 and several of its deconstructed analogs at human sigma(1) (h sigma(1)) receptors. We monitored their subtype selectivity by determining the binding affinity at sigma(2) receptors. In addition, we validated an existing pharmacophore model at the molecular level by conducting 3D molecular modeling studies, using the crystal structure of h sigma(1) receptors, and Hydrophatic INTeractions (HINT) analysis. Our structure affinity relationship studies showed that 1 binds with lower affinity at h sigma(1) receptors (K-i = 17.3 nM) compared to guinea pig; moreover, we found that none of the fenpropimorph methyl groups is important for its binding at h sigma(1) receptors, nor is stereochemistry. For example, removal of all methyl groups as seen in 4 resulted in an almost 5-fold higher affinity at h sigma(1) receptors compared to 1 and 350-fold selectivity versus sigma(2) receptors. In addition, although the O atom of the morpholine ring does not contribute to affinity at h sigma(1) receptors (and might even detract from it), it plays role in subtype (sigma(1) versus sigma(2) receptor) selectivity.

The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their potential ability to displace [I-125] Sar(1) Ile(8)-Ang II, which was specifically bound to human AT(1) receptor. Radioligand binding assays revealed nanomolar affinity in several compounds under study. The IC50 values of nine ligands were higher than those of Losartan. The screening of decreased blood pressure in spontaneous hypertensive rats displayed that compound 8S (IC50 = 5.0 nM) was equipotent with Losartan, whereas compounds 13R (IC50 = 7.3 nM), 14R (IC50 = 6.3 nM), and 14S (IC50 = 3.5 nM) were slightly ahead of Losartan, and the most significant activity was demonstrated by compound 8R (IC50 = 1.1 nM). Candidate 8R was identified for its excellent efficacy in antihypertension and fairly low toxicity based on plasma analyses, toxicology studies, and chronic oral tests. Finally, compound 8R exhibited strong and multiple interactions with target active sites of the theoretical AT(1) receptor model in docking study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Imaging Changes in Synaptic Acetylcholine Availability in Living Human Subjects	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						brain beta(star)(2)-nAChRs; I-123-5-IA SPECT; physostigmine; extracellular acetylcholine	RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY; IN-VIVO; BRAIN; SMOKING; BINDING	In vivo estimation of beta(2)-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor availability with molecular neuroimaging is complicated by competition between the endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine and the radioligand I-123-3-[2(S)-2-azetidinylmethoxy]pyridine (I-123-5-IA). We examined whether binding of I-123-5-IA is sensitive to increases in extracellular levels of acetylcholine in humans, as suggested in nonhuman primates. Methods: Six healthy subjects (31 +/- 4 y) participated in a I-123-5-IA SPECT study. After baseline scans, physostigmine (1-1.5 mg) was administered intravenously over 60 min, and 9 additional scans were obtained. Results: We observed a significant reduction in the total volume of distribution after physostigmine administration (29% +/- 17% in the cortex, 19% +/- 15% in the thalamus, 19% +/- 15% in the striatum, and 36% +/- 30% in the cerebellum; P < 0.05). This reduction reflected a combination of a region-specific 7%-16% decrease in tissue concentration of tracer and a 9% increase in plasma parent concentration. Conclusion: These data suggest that increases in acetylcholine compete with I-123-5-IA for binding to beta(2)-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Additional validation of this paradigm is warranted, but it may be used to interrogate changes in extracellular acetylcholine.	[Esterlis, Irina; Hannestad, Jonas O.; Bois, Frederic; Sewell, R.

A radioligand binding assay and immunohistochemistry were used to estimate the number of AMPA receptors and endogenous neural stem cells respectively. Results showed that the number of AMPA receptors and endogenous neural stem cells in the brain stem and sensorimotor cortex were significantly increased, while motor function was significantly decreased at postnatal days 90 and 120. After administration of FGF-2 into mice, numbers of endogenous neural stem cells increased, while expression of AMPA receptors decreased, whilst motor functions were recovered. At postnatal day 120, the number of AMPA receptors was negatively correlated with the number of endogenous neural stem cells in model mice and FGF-2-treated mice. Our experimental findings indicate that FGF-2 can inhibit AMPA receptors and increase the number of endogenous neural stem cells, thus repairing neural injury in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis mice.

Given that different brain regions are neuroanatomically and functionally different, DA receptor binding in different brain regions may be selectively important to specific cognitive functions. Using PET and the radioligand SCH23390, we measured D1 receptor binding potential (BPND) in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), hippocampus (HC), as well as in sensorimotor (SMST), associative (AST), and limbic (IST) striatum in 20 healthy younger persons. Subjects completed tasks assessing executive functioning, episodic memory, speed, and general knowledge. Unlike previous reports, we found no linear or curvilinear relationships between D1 receptor binding in DLPFC and performance in any cognitive task. However, BPND in HC was positively linked to executive performance as well as to speed and knowledge. With regard to the striatal subregions, D1 BPND in SMST was more strongly related to speed compared to the other striatal subregions, whereas D1 BPND in AST was more strongly linked to general knowledge. These findings provide support for the notion that D1 receptors in separate brain regions are differentially related to performance in tasks tapping various cognitive domains. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

At a concentration of >10(-6) M, diazepam competed with [H-3]dihydroalprenolol for beta-adrenoceptor, but not [H-3] prazosin for et-adrenoceptor or [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate for muscarinic receptor. Continuous administration of diazepam at doses of 0.4 mg/kg/day, i.p. for 7 days in rat significantly decreased pilocarpine (4.0 mg/kg, i.p.)-induced parotid salivary flow. Diazepam also produced a significant increase in the dissociation constant (Kd) value for [H-3]dihydroalprenolol binding, but no change in the maximal binding capacity (Bmax) value, and a decrease in the Kd value for [H-3]diazepam binding to benzodiazepine receptors, but no change in the Kd or Bmax values for [H-3]prazosin or [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding. These results suggest that continuous administration of diazepam modifies affinity for [beta-adrenoceptor and benzodiazepine receptor binding sites in parotid gland membrane and that changes in these binding sites may be closely related to diazepam-induced suppression of salivary secretion.

Here we tested the hypotheses that multiple nicotine administration would prevent the effects of kainic acid on neuronal nicotinic receptor subtypes densities (alpha-bungarotoxin sensitive and alpha-bungarotoxin insentive) and on hippocampal cell degeneration. METHODS: Radioligand binding study was used to detect the particular nAChR subtypes densities. Two histochemical methods (bis-benzimide staining and Fluoro-Jade B dye) were used to detect and evaluate neuronal degeneration. RESULTS: Our study shows that: a) kainic acid single administration increased the number of alpha-bungarotoxin insentive nicotinic receptors, b) nicotine was able to prevent such changes, c) repeated nicotine administration is capable to attenuate the damage of CAI and CA3 areas of the hippocampus. No effect on alpha-bungarotoxin sentive nicotinic receptors was observed. Our data therefore reveal the importance of alpha-bungarotoxin insentive nicotinic receptors in the response to kainite and the ability of nicotine to prevent such changes both in the cell degeneration and in number of receptors. CONCLUSION: Nicotine administration influences alpha-bungarotoxin insensitive receptors and repeated administration is capable to protect against toxicity caused by kainic acid in hippocampal area.

To facilitate diagnosis of AD by radioligand imaging, several highly specific small-molecule amyloid ligands have been developed. Because amyloid ligands display excellent pharmacokinetics properties and brain bioavailability, and because we have previously shown that some amyloid ligands bind the highly neurotoxic A beta oligomers (A beta O) with high affinities, they may also be valuable candidates for anti-A beta therapies. Here we identified two fluorene compounds from libraries of amyloid ligands, initially based on their ability to block cell death secondary to intracellular A beta O. We found that the lead fluorenes were able to reduce the amyloid burden including the levels of A beta O in cultured neurons and in 5xFAD mice. To explain these in vitro and in vivo effects, we found that the lead fluorenes bind and destabilize A beta O as shown by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy studies, and block the harmful A beta O-synapse interaction. These fluorenes and future derivatives, therefore, have a potential use in AD therapy and research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

A Novel Substituted Piperazine, CM156, Attenuates the Stimulant and Toxic Effects of Cocaine in Mice	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; SIGMA-RECEPTOR LIGANDS; PROTEIN EXPRESSION; BINDING-SITES; BRAIN; INVOLVEMENT; ADDICTION; GENE; NEUROPLASTICITY; ANTAGONISTS	Cocaine is a highly abused drug without effective pharmacotherapies to treat it. It interacts with sigma (sigma) receptors, providing logical targets for the development of medications to counteract its actions. Cocaine causes toxic and stimulant effects that can be categorized as acute effects such as convulsions and locomotor hyperactivity and subchronic effects including sensitization and place conditioning. In the present study, 3-(4-(4-cyclohexylpiperazin-1-yl)butyl)benzo[d]thiazole-2(3H)-thione (CM156), a novel compound, was developed and tested for interactions with sigma receptors using radioligand binding studies. It was also evaluated against cocaine-induced effects in behavioral studies. The results showed that CM156 has nanomolar affinities for each of the sigma receptor subtypes in the brain and much weaker affinities for non-sigma binding sites. Pretreatment of male Swiss-Webster mice with CM156, before administering either a convulsive or locomotor stimulant dose of cocaine, led to a significant attenuation of these acute effects. CM156 also significantly reduced the expression of behavioral sensitization and place conditioning evoked by subchronic exposure to cocaine. The protective effects of CM156 are consistent with sigma receptor-mediated actions. Together with previously reported findings, the data from CM156 and related sigma compounds indicate that sigma receptors can be targeted to alleviate deleterious actions of cocaine.

Binding events at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are usually interpreted from radioligand binding studies in terms of two-step ligand-induced receptor isomerization. We report here, using a combination of fluorescence approaches, on the molecular mechanisms for Bodipypirenzepine binding to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-fused muscarinic M1 receptors in living cells. Real time monitoring, under steady-state conditions, of the strong fluorescence energy transfer signal elicited by this interaction permitted a fine kinetic description of the binding process. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements allowed us to identify discrete EGFP lifetime species and to follow their redistribution upon ligand binding. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, with EGFP brightness analysis, showed that EGFP-fused muscarinic M1 receptors predominate as monomers in the absence of ligand and dimerize upon pirenzepine binding. Finally, all these experimental data could be quantitatively reconciled into a three-step mechanism, with four identified receptor conformational states. Fast ligand binding to a peripheral receptor site initiates a sequence of conformational changes that allows the ligand to access to inner regions of the protein and drives ligand-receptor complexes toward a high affinity dimeric state.

Carbon/silicon exchange (sila-substitution) at the 4-position of the piperidine ring of 1a (R3COH --> R3SiOH) leads to sila-haloperidol (1b). Sila-haloperidol was synthesized in a new multistep synthesis, starting from tetramethoxysilane and taking advantage of the properties of the 2,4,6-trimethoxyphenyl unit as a unique protecting group for silicon. The pharmacological profiles of the C/Si analogues 7 a and 1b were studied in competitive receptor binding assays at D-1-D-5, sigma(1), and sigma(2) receptors. Sila-haloperidol (1b) exhibits significantly different receptor subtype selectivities from haloperidol (1a) at both receptor families. The C/Si analogues I a and 1b. were also studied for 1) their physiochemical properties (log D, pK(a), solubility in HBSS buffer (pH 7.4)), 2) their permeability in a human Caco-2 model, 3) their pharmacokinetic profiles in human and rat liver microsomes, and 4) their inhibition of the five major cytochrome P450 isoforms. In addition, the major in vitro metabolites of sila-holoperidol (1b) in human liver microsomes were identified using mass-spectrometric techniques. Due to the special chemical properties of silicon, the metabolic fates of the C/Si analogues 1a and 1b are totally different.

A cell line was isolated that stably expressed the receptor as evidenced by BMY 7378-sensitive noradrenaline-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentration. The effect of noradrenaline was blocked by active phorbol esters; such blockade was mediated by protein kinase C (PKC) as evidenced by its inhibition by staurosporine or the downregulation of this protein kinase. Radioligand binding experiments showed expression of receptors with high affinity for [H-3]tamsulosin (K-D 0.30 +/- 0.05 nM) but low density (B-max 35 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein). The receptors had the expected orders of potency for agonists (adrenaline = noradrenaline > oxymetazoline) and antagonists (BMY 7378 > 5-methyl-urapidil = phentolamine). Photoaffinity labeling identified the receptor as a band of M-r 70-80 kDa, which could be immunoprecipitated with a selective anti-alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antiserum. In cells metabolically labeled with radioactive phosphate the adrenoceptor was identified as a phosphoprotein whose phosphorylation state was increased by the agonist, noradrenaline, and by phorbol myristate acetate. The data indicate that the human alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor function was regulated through phosphorylation by PKC. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Design and methods: Neutrophils were obtained from 15 patients with OA, 15 patients with RA, and 15 petients with PA. fMLP stimulation was performed to aliquots of neutrophils from six healthy individuals. Evaluation of kinetic parameters of PBR was performed using [H-3]PK11195, as specific radioligand compared with 15 healthy volunteers. Results: The results showed a significant decrease of K-d and B-max in fMLP-stimulated neutrophil membranes. Moreover, an increase of PBR binding sites and affinity value was observed in neutrophils membranes from PA patients. Conclusions: Our data suggested a fMLP modulation on [H-3]PK11195 binding in human neutrophils. Moreover, our results showed an up-regulation of PBR in neutrophils of PA patients.

Competitive radioligand binding assays of this conjugate with recombinant ER showed that the conjugate bound to ER in a dose-dependent manner with an EC50 of 274nM, compared with 1 nM for estradiol, the natural ligand. Cellular uptake studies with ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative HS578t human breast cancer cells revealed that, the conjugate was taken up by MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner, which was obliterated by co-incubation with a large excess of estradiol. On the other hand there was very little uptake of the un-conjugated porphyrin by MCF-7 and Hs578t cells. HS578t cells also showed insignificant uptake of the conjugate under the conditions of our experiment. These results strongly suggested that specific interaction between the endogenous ER in MCF-7 cells and the estrogen part of the conjugate enabled these cells to selectively internalize the conjugate over the un-conjugated porphyrin. Therefore, ER-binding conjugates of estradiol and porphyrins could potentially be used for ER-targeted photodynamic therapy of hormone-sensitive cancers of breast, ovary, gonads etc. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The potent and enzymatically stable analogues MT-II (Ac-Nle-c[Asp-His-DPhe-Arg-Trp-Lys]-NH2) and SHU9119 (Ac-Nle-c[Asp-His-DNal(2')-Arg-Trp-Lys]-NH2) are important ligands of these receptors but are relatively nonselective. To differentiate between the physiological functions of these receptors, agonists, and antagonists with improved receptor selectivities are needed. We report here analogues of the well-characterized antagonist SHU9119 in which we replaced His' with conformationally constrained amino acids. By this structure-activity study we discovered two important compounds, PG-901 (Ac-Nle(4)-c[Asp(5)-Pro(6)-DNal(2')(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Lys(10)]-NH2) and PG-911 (Ac-Nle(4)-c[Asp(5)-Hyp(6)-DNal(2')(7)-Arg(8)-Trp(9)-Lys(10)]-NH2), characterized to be full agonists at the hMC5R (EC50 = 0.072 nM and 0.031 nM, respectively), but full antagonists at the hMC3R and the hMC4R. We also demonstrated that the relative stereochemistry of the amino acid at the 6-position is critical for activity, and could play an important role in potency as well as in selectivity for the melanocortin receptors.

In a cell-based iNOS assay (A-172 astrocytoma cells) the inhibitors had low-nanomolar IC50 values and thus were >1,000-fold more potent than the substrate-based direct iNOS inhibitors 1400W and N-methyl-L-arginine. Biochemical studies confirmed that inhibitors caused accumulation of iNOS monomers in mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. High affinity (K-d approximate to 3 nM) of inhibitors for isolated iNOS monomers was confirmed by using a radioligand binding assay. Inhibitors were >1,000-fold selective for iNOS versus endothelial NOS dimerization in a cell-based assay. The crystal structure of inhibitor bound to the monomeric iNOS oxygenase domain revealed inhibitor-heme coordination and substantial perturbation of the substrate binding site and the dimerization interface, indicating that this small molecule acts by allosterically disrupting protein-protein interactions at the dimer interface. These results provide a mechanism-based approach to highly selective iNOS inhibition. Inhibitors were active in vivo, with ED50 values of <2 mg/kg in a rat model of endotoxin-induced systemic iNOs induction. Thus, this class of dimerization inhibitors has broad therapeutic potential in iNOS-mediated pathologies.

We have shown that contortrostatin binds to integrins alpha IIb beta 3, alpha 5 beta 1, and alpha v beta 3. We now use several criteria to demonstrate the binding of contortrostatin to alpha v beta 5. First, incubation of T24 cells, which express alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 1, with antibody against alpha v beta 3 failed to completely inhibit adhesion of cells to vitronectin, However, pretreatment of the cells with contortrostatin or the combination of antibodies against alpha v beta 3 and alpha v beta 3 completely blocked adhesion to vitronectin. By contrast, either anti-alpha v beta 5 alone or contortrostatin blocked adhesion of an alpha v beta 3-negative T24 subline, Second, contortrostatin as well as anti-alpha v beta 5 inhibits invasion of OVCAR-5, which express only alpha v beta 5. Third, contortrostatin binds to purified alpha v beta 5 in a saturable manner, Finally, radioligand binding assays yielded a K-d, value of 24 nM for [I-125]contortrostatin binding to alpha v beta 5. This investigation identifies alpha v beta 5 as a binding site for contortrostatin, Blockage of alpha v beta 5 by contortrostatin inhibits alpha v beta 5-mediated adhesion and invasion.

The molecular basis of drug selectivity for α5 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors	NATURE STRUCTURAL & MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access							GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; BENZODIAZEPINE SITE; INHIBITORY NEUROTRANSMISSION; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; INVERSE AGONIST; A RECEPTORS; MOUSE MODEL; PROTEIN; LIGAND; MODULATION	alpha 5 subunit-containing gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors represent a promising drug target for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Altered expression and function contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Dup15q and Angelman syndromes, developmental epilepsy and autism. Effective drug action without side effects is dependent on both alpha 5-subtype selectivity and the strength of the positive or negative allosteric modulation (PAM or NAM). Here we solve structures of drugs bound to the alpha 5 subunit. These define the molecular basis of binding and alpha 5 selectivity of the beta-carboline, methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM), type II benzodiazepine NAMs, and a series of isoxazole NAMs and PAMs. For the isoxazole series, each molecule appears as an 'upper' and 'lower' moiety in the pocket. Structural data and radioligand binding data reveal a positional displacement of the upper moiety containing the isoxazole between the NAMs and PAMs. Using a hybrid molecule we directly measure the functional contribution of the upper moiety to NAM versus PAM activity. Overall, these structures provide a framework by which to understand distinct modulator binding modes and their basis of alpha 5-subtype selectivity, appreciate structure-activity relationships, and empower future structure-based drug design campaigns.

Neurotensin(8-13) analogs as dual NTS1 and NTS2 receptor ligands with enhanced effects on a mouse model of Parkinson's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Neurotensin; Peptide analogs; Agonists; Neurotensin receptors; Parkinson 's disease	MONOAMINE-OXIDASE B; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; ARTIFICIAL MEMBRANE; BINDING; DOPAMINE; DESIGN; DERIVATIVES; IMPLEMENTATION; IDENTIFICATION; SUBNANOMOLAR	The modulatory interactions between neurotensin (NT) and the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system in the brain suggest that NT may be associated with the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). NT exerts its neurophysiological effects by interactions with the human NT receptors type 1 (hNTS1) and 2 (hNTS2). Therefore, both receptor subtypes are promising targets for the development of novel NT-based analogs for the treatment of PD. In this study, we used a virtually guided molecular modeling approach to predict the activity of NT(8-13) analogs by investigating the docking models of ligands designed for binding to the human NTS1 and NTS2 receptors. The importance of the residues at positions 8 and/or 9 for hNTS1 and hNTS2 receptor binding affinity was experimentally confirmed by radioligand binding assays. Further in vitro ADME profiling and in vivo studies revealed that, compared to the parent peptide NT(8-13), compound 10 exhibited improved stability and BBB permeability combined with a significant enhancement of the motor function and memory in a mouse model of PD. The herein reported NTS1/NTS2 dual-specific NT(8-13) analogs represent an attractive tool for the development of therapeutic strategies against PD and potentially other CNS disorders.

Areas covered Extensive experience outside the United States as well as randomized phase II and phase III data demonstrate that Lu-177-vipivotide tetraxetan is a safe, generally well tolerated, and effective therapy for men with mCRPC. Lu-177-vipivotide tetraxetan was approved by the FDA in March 2022 for the treatment of PSMA-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) after androgen receptor pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy based on the results of the VISION trial. Expert opinion This review discusses the development and studies leading to the approval of Lu-177-vipivotide tetraxetan. In all, Lu-177-vipivotide tetraxetan is an exciting new tool in the arsenal for men with mCRPC after novel androgen pathway inhibitors and at least one taxane chemotherapy. Optimal selection of patients, sequencing of Lu-177-vipivotide tetraxetan with the other agents available to treat mCRPC, and the use of dosimetry are current areas of interest with great potential and opportunities for further individual patient optimization using the tools of theranostics.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-based positron emission tomography (PET) imaging has become increasingly popular as a novel molecular imaging technique capable of improving the clinical management of patients with prostate cancer. To date, several Ga-68 and F-18-labeled PSMA-targeted molecules have shown promising results in imaging patients with recurrent prostate cancer using PET/computed tomography (PET/CT). Studies of involving PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals also suggest a higher sensitivity and specificity, along with an improved detection rate over conventional imaging (CT scan and methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy) and C-11/F-18-choline PET/CT. In addition, PSMA-617 and PSMA I&T ligands can be labeled with alpha and beta-minus emitters (e.g., Ac-225, Y-90, and Lu-177) and serve as a theranostic tool for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. While the clinical impact of such concept remains to be verified, the preliminary results of PSMA molecular radiotherapy are very encouraging. Herein, we highlighted the current status of development and future perspectives of PSMA-targeted radiopharmaceuticals and their clinical applications.

The relationship between these processes and cognitive dysfunctions has not been explored. Methods: We recruited 50 never-medicated patients with MDD and 30 healthy control subjects. We used [F-18]-FEPPA positron emission tomography (PET) to examine translocator protein total distribution volume (TSPO V-T), a marker of microglia. Cognitive functions were evaluated with the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) (attention, immediate and delyed memory, language, and visuospatial functions). Results: Patients with MDD showed elevated TSPO V-T in all regions of interest (white matter, grey matter, frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and hippocampus) and were impaired on the attention and delayed memory domains of the RBANS. In the frontal cortex, increased TSPO VT was associated with lower scores on the RBANS attention domain when the analysis was corrected for age, gender, education, and depressive symptoms. Limitations: Affective functions were not investigated, the specificity of [F-1(8)]-FEPPA binding is limited, TSPO may reflect microglia/macrophage density rather than activation, and the sample was not balanced (more patients were included than controls). Conclusions: Attentional dysfunctions may be associated with microglial pathology in the frontal cortex of untreated patients with MDD.

The pharmacological activities of MK-801, phencyclidine (PCP), dexoxadrol, etoxadrol, (S)- and (R)-ketamine, dextromethorphan, memantine, and amantadine were analyzed under uniform assay conditions. Affinity toward the PCP and ifenprodil binding sites was recorded in radioligand binding assays. GluN2A and GluN2B subtype-specific cytoprotective activity was determined in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. The data were correlated with published IC50 values obtained in two-electrode voltage clamp experiments. A high correlation was found between PCP affinity, ion flux inhibition, and cytoprotective activity. The channel blockers were classified into four groups showing high, moderate, low, and very low potency. Some of the open channel blockers display unexpected subtype selectivity. The comparative study allows the characterization of open channel blockers from their receptor ligand interaction via inhibition of ion flux up to overall cytoprotective activity. The subtype preference of some open channel blockers will stimulate the development of novel subtype-selective open channel blockers with decreased side effect potential.

Here, we evaluated whether [C-11]ABP688, a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand that binds to the allosteric site of the metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5), is sensitive to glutamate fluctuations after a pharmacological challenge. For this, we used ceftriaxone (CEF) administration in rats, an activator of the GLT-1 transporter (EAAT2), which is known to decrease extracellular levels of glutamate. MicroPET [C-11]ABP688 dynamic acquisitions were conducted in rats after a venous injection of either saline (baseline) or CEF 200 mg/kg (challenge). Binding potentials (BPND) were obtained using the simplified reference tissue method. Between-condition statistical parametric maps indicating brain regions showing the highest CEF effects guided placement of microdialysis probes for subsequent assessment of extracellular levels of glutamate. The CEF administration increased [C-11]ABP688 BPND in the thalamic ventral anterior (VA) nucleus bilaterally. Subsequent microdialysis assessment revealed declines in extracellular glutamate concentrations in the VA. The present results support the concept that availability of mGluR5 allosteric binding sites is sensitive to extracellular concentrations of glutamate. This interesting property of mGluR5 allosteric binding sites has potential applications for assessing the role of glutamate in the pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric conditions.

The frequency of different subsets of NK and NKT cells, including IFN-gamma(+) and CD107a(+) NK and NKT cells, in 27 patients with newly diagnosed LADA and 20 healthy controls (HC) were determined by flow cytometry. The concentrations of serum autoantibodies against GAD65 were measured by direct radioligand assay. The potential association of the frequency of NK cells with clinical measures was analyzed. In comparison with that in the HC, significantly higher frequency of peripheral blood NK and NKp46(+) NK cells, but lower frequency of KIR3DL1(+) NK cells were detected in patients with newly diagnosed LADA (p < 0.0001, p < 0.0001, p = 0.0039, respectively). The percentages of inducible IFN-gamma(+) NK cells were significantly higher in the LADA patients than that in the HC (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the percentages of NKp46(+) NK cells were negatively correlated with the levels of fasting plasma C-peptide in patients (R = -0.4877, p = 0.0099). There was no significant difference in the frequency of spontaneous and inducible CD107a(+) between patients and controls. Our data indicate a higher frequency of activated NKp46(+) NK cells may be associated with the development of LADA in humans.

Extracts from hardwood trees used in commercial paper mills contain biologically active neurochemical disruptors	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Neuroendocrine disruption; Pulp and paper mill effluent; Hardwood tree feedstocks; Fish; Reproductive inhibition; Phytochemicals	WILD RIVER OTTERS; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE; MERCURY; PULP; REPRODUCTION; EFFLUENTS; INHIBITION; SUBSTANCES; L.	Following on our discovery that pulp and paper mill effluents can interact with, and disrupt, various neurotransmitter receptors and enzymes important to fish reproduction, we tested wood and bark extracts of 14 Eastern North American hardwood trees used in pulp and paper production. Radioligand binding to neurotransmitter receptors, including the dopamine-2 receptor (D2), the gamma aminobutyric acid receptor A (GABA(A)), N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor, and muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mACh-R), were significantly changed following in vitro incubations with many but not all extracts. Activities of neurotransmitter-related enzymes monoamine oxidase (MAO), GABA-transaminase (GABA-T), acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) were also significantly altered. Butternut wood extracts and the isolated compound juglone significantly inhibited the enzymatic activities of MAO and GAD which we suggest may be part of a mechanism that may negatively affect fish reproduction. Besides giving credence to the hypothesis that neuroactive compounds in pulp and paper effluent may originate in the trees used by mills, the results reported here also indicate important neuropharmacological activities in hard-woods which may help identify new sources of biologically active natural products.

Detection of androgenic activity in emissions from diesel fuel and biomass combustion	ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						endocrine disruptors; diesel exhaust; biomass; androgenic activity	EXHAUST AFFECTS; ANTIESTROGENIC ACTIVITY; RIVER WATER; CELL-LINE; RECEPTOR; EXTRACTS; AGONIST; MASCULINIZATION; ANTAGONIST; INHALATION	The present study evaluated both diesel fuel exhaust and biomass (wood) burn extracts for androgen receptor-mediated activity using MDA-kb2 cells, which contain an androgen-responsive promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct. This assay and analytical fractionization of the samples were used as tools to separate active from inactive fractions, with the goal of identifying the specific compounds responsible for the activity. A significant androgenic response was detected from the diesel emission. High-performance liquid chromatographic fractionation of the sample indicated that significant androgenic activity was retained in three fractions. 4-Hydroxybiphenyl was identified from the most active fraction using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy. This purified compound was then tested at doses from 1 nM to 100 mu M. 4-Hydroxybiphenol exhibited antagonist activity at low concentrations and agonist activity at high concentrations. A competitive-binding assay confirmed binding to the androgen receptor, with a median inhibitory concentration for radioligand binding of approximately 370 nM. Significant androgenic activity also was detected in the wood burn samples, but we were unable to identify the specific chemicals responsible for this endocrine activity. The present study demonstrates that in vitro bioassays can serve as sensitive bioanalytical tools to aid in characterization of complex environmental mixtures.

We describe the characterization, validation, and application of a solid-phase radioligand binding assay that can be used to assess the interaction of peptides and small molecules at the extracellular domain (ECD) of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR). The assay utilizes a C-terminal tag on the FSHR-ECD, which is used to capture the ECD and position it in a sterically favorable orientation on a solid-phase platform. Competition experiments with the cognate ligand, FSH, indicated that the interaction at the FSHR-ECD using the solid-phase assay was comparable to the full-length receptor assayed using a standard filtration assay. The utility of the assay was evaluated by competing several peptides and a small molecule for both the full-length FSHR and the FSHR-ECD. The solid-phase capture format allowed for the establishment of an assay to specifically evaluate compounds that interact at the ECD or require the full-length receptor, thereby facilitating structure-activity studies. This assay format should be applicable to the other receptors of this family. (c) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In contrast to functional findings, less information is available on its localization in the kidney. Neither RT-PCR studies nor radioligand binding assays are suitable to selectively determine the distribution of renal D3R at the level of cellular or even subcellular structures. We studied the renal D3R distribution in Sprague-Dawley rats by a polyclonal antiserum directed against an epitope in the third intracytoplasmic loop. D3R immunoreactivity was detected by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy. D3R staining was confined to the renal cortex and occurred in proximal convoluted tubules near or in direct connection with the urinary pole of the glomeruli. The fluorescent spots were restricted to the subapical portion of the proximal tubular cells. Double staining with the F-actin marker phalloidin revealed a localization of the D3R below the brush border region. However, staining by anti-beta(1)/beta(2)-adaptins, recognizing clathrin-coated compartments, did not correspond to the distribution of the D3R signal. This is the first description of a D3R accumulation in a cytoplasmic pool in the kidney, probably corresponding to a recycling mechanism or storage compartment.

Introduction of the electrophilic isothiocyanate and bromoacetamide groups on the para position of Phe(3) and Phe(5) was accomplished by incorporating Fmoc-Phe(p-NHAlloc) into the peptide followed by selective deprotection and modification. The corresponding amine-containing peptides were also prepared. The pure peptides were evaluated in radioligand binding experiments using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing mu- and delta-opioid receptors. In dermorphin, introduction of the electrophilic groups in the 'message' domain lowered the binding affinity by > 1000-fold; only [Phe(p-NH2)(3)]dermorphin retained nanomolar affinity for p-receptors. Modifications in the 'address' region of both dermorphin and [LyS7]dermorphin were relatively well tolerated. In particular, [Phe(p-NH2)(5),LyS(7)]dermorphin showed similar affinity to dermorphin, with almost 2-fold higher selectivity for p-receptors. [Phe(p-NHCOCH2Br)(5)]- and [Phe(p-NHCOCH2Br)(5),Lys(7)]dermorphin exhibited relatively high affinity (IC50 27.7 and 15.1 nm, respectively) for mu-receptors. However, neither of these peptides inhibited [H-3]DAMGO binding in a wash-resistant manner.

In this context, blocking of these receptors is of paramount importance in progression of such diseases. In the current investigation, novel histamine H-3 receptor ligands were designed by exploiting scaffold-hopping drug-design strategy. We inspected the designed molecules in terms of ADME properties, drug-likeness, as well as toxicity profiles. Additionally molecular docking and dynamics simulation studies were performed to predict binding mode and binding free energy calculations, respectively. Among the designed structures, we selected compound d2 and its demethylated derivative as examples for synthesis and affinity measurement. In vitro binding assays of the synthesized molecules demonstrated that d2 has lower binding affinity (K-i = 2.61 mu M) in radioligand displacement assay to hH(3)R than that of demethylated form (K-i = 12.53 mu M). The newly designed compounds avoid of any toxicity predictors resulted from extended in silico and experimental studies, can offer another scaffold for histamine H3R antagonists for further structure-activity relationship studies.

BChE activity is present in white matter and localizes to activated microglia associated with MS lesions. The purpose of this study was to further characterize changes in the cholinergic system in MS pathology, and to explore the utility of BChE radioligands as potential diagnostic and treatment monitoring agents in MS. Procedure Cortical and white matter lesions were identified using myelin staining, and lesions were classified based on microglial activation patterns. Adjacent brain sections were used for cholinesterase histochemistry andin vitroautoradiography using phenyl 4-[I-123]-iodophenylcarbamate (I-123-PIP), a previously described small-molecule cholinesterase-binding radioligand. Results BChE activity is positively correlated with microglial activation in white matter MS lesions. There is no alteration in cholinesterase activity in cortical MS lesions.I-123-PIP autoradiography revealed uptake of radioactivity in normal white matter, absence of radioactivity within demyelinated MS lesions, and variable uptake of radioactivity in adjacent normal-appearing white matter. Conclusions BChE imaging agents have the potential to detect MS lesions and subtle pathology in normal-appearing white matter in postmortem MS brain tissue. The possibility of BChE imaging agents serving to supplement current diagnostic and treatment monitoring strategies should be evaluated.	[Thorne, M. W. D.; Cash, M. K.; Reid, G. A.; Burley, D.

The verification of the real-time radioimmunoassay technology usefulness for ligand-quality characteristics evaluation such as concentration, influence of radiolabeling on binding affinity and stability was estimated. The anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody I-131-cetuximab was employed as the ligand antibody. The concentration of I-131-cetuximab was derived from the shape of binding curves coming from the ligand-receptor interaction. The binding curves also allowed the estimation of I-131-cetuximab binding affinity for different radiolabeling procedures (incubation times 1, 5, and 10minutes) in stability testing up to 96hours at 4 degrees C. The stability testing also included comparative analysis by size exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. The assessment of cetuximab concentrations using real-time method showed acceptable accordance between real and calculated values. The real-time method revealed that 1-minute radiolabeling proved to be the optimal incubation time for direct radioiodination of cetuximab. Stability testing showed the significant change in radioligand affinity by one order at the longest incubation times (72 and 96hours). Characterization of stability and binding behavior of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies by the verified real-time method before use in other assays may be employed to eliminate variability and suboptimal antibody performance.

Radiation dosimetry was estimated from the whole body biodistribution, taking into consideration TSPO rs6971 (Ala147Thr) polymorphism. [F-18]-FEPPA whole body PET scans were acquired for six healthy subjects. Time-activity curves were generated from regions of interest of nine organs, from which normalized accumulated activities were calculated and thus internal dose, using OLINDA/EXM 1.1. Genotyping of rs6971, associated with high- and low-affinity [F-18]-FEPPA binding (high-affinity binder (HAB) and low-affinity binder (LAB)), was performed. Five subjects exhibited the C/C (HAB) allele, and the other carried the minor allele T/T (LAB). The LAB whole body biodistribution showed highest radioactivity accumulation in bladder, whereas in HABs, the spleen received the highest dose. The effective dose of the single LAB (16.3 mu Sv/MBq) was 23 % less than the mean of the HABs (21.0 +/- 2.9 mu Sv/MBq). When including all subjects, the effective dose was 20.2 +/- 3.0 mu Sv/MBq. [F-18]-FEPPA radiation dose is consistent with other F-18-labeled radioligands and the Ala147Thr genotype agreed with [F-18]-FEPPA distribution.

[H-3]Metyrapol and 4- [I-131]iodometomidate bind with high affinity to membranes prepared from bovine and rat adrenals. Here we report inhibitory potencies of several compounds structurally related to one or both of these adrenostatic drugs, against the binding of both radioligands to rat adrenal membranes. While derivatives of etomidate inhibited the binding of both radioligands with similar potencies, derivatives of metyrapone inhibited the binding of 4-[I-131]iodometomidate about 10 times weaker than the binding of [H-3]metyrapol. By X-ray structure analysis the absolute configuration of (+)-1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-2-(pyridin-3-yl)-1-propanol [(+)-11, a derivative of metyrapol] was established as (R). We introduce 1-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-methyl-2-(pyridin-3-yl)-1-propanone (9; K-i = 6 nM), 2-(1-imidazolyl)-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propanone (13; 2 nM), and (R)-(+)-[1-(4-iodophenyl)ethyl]-1H-imidazole (34; 4 nM) as new high affinity ligands for the metyrapol binding site on 11 beta-hydroxylase and discuss our results in relation to a proposed active site model of 11 beta-hydroxylase.

This current study examined the role of DAT in depressed patients before and after bupropion treatment Twenty-three patients with major depression were treated with bupropion for 8 weeks. Before and after the treatment, they and 20 normal subjects received the radioligand Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 single photon emission tomography scan (SPECT). Subjects were assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. All DAT images were spatially normalized to an averaged brain template, and the specific binding ratios of the striatum, caudate, and putamen were calculated according the formulae of: [region counts] / [occipital counts] - 1. Depressed patients had greater DAT availability on both sides of the striatum. DAT binding was significantly decreased in the striatum after bupropion treatment Women had higher initial and final DAT binding in the right and left caudate when compared to depressed men. DAT binding decreased in all areas of the brain in women after successful antidepressant treatment, but only in the right caudate of men. Depressed patients had a greater availability of DAT; it was decreased after bupropion treatment.Women seemed to have more DAT availability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: The assays for radioligand-receptor binding, the contractile responses of isolated iris muscle, the miosis response, and the intraocular hypotension of the enantiomers of satropane were investigated. Results: In the binding analysis, S(-)satropane (lesatropane) completely competed against the [H-3]quinuclydinyl benzilate-labeled ligand at muscarinic receptors in the iris muscle, whereas R(+)satropane failed to completely compete. In an isolated iris contractile assay, R,S(+/-)satropane and S(-)satropane produced a concentration-dependent contractile response with similar efficacy and potency to that of carbachol. R(+)satropane did not induce any contractile response. In the pupil diameter measurement assay in vivo, S(-)satropane induced miosis much more effectively than pilocarpine, while R(+)satropane failed to produce any miosis. In the water loading-induced and methylcellulose-induced ocular hypertensive models, S(-)satropane, but not R(+)satropane, significantly suppressed intraocular pressure at a much lower concentration than pilocarpine. Conclusion: The agonistic and hypotensive properties of satropane on rabbit eyes are stereoselective, with the S(-)isomer being its active form.

A monkey occupancy study with the radioligand indicated that (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 can be useful for quantitative PET analysis. In this preliminary study, regional distributions in the living human brain were evaluated. Materials and methods Brain PET measurements were performed for a total of 255 min after the injection of 188.3 +/- 5.7 MBq of (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 in four healthy male subjects. Regions of interests were drawn on the thalamus and the caudate in the coregistered MRI/PET images. Results (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 displayed good brain penetration and selective retention in regions rich in norepinephrine reuptake sites. The transient peak equilibrium was reached during the PET measurements. The ratios of radioactivity uptake in the thalamus to that in the caudate were 1.50 +/- 0.06 for the time period of 90-255 min. Conclusion The present preliminary investigation indicates that (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 has suitable characteristics for probing the norepinephrine reuptake system with PET in the human brain.

The affinity of the nonphenolic glaucine methiodide (4) (vs [(3) H]cytisine) was the lowest at alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR (K-i = 10 mu M), and predicentrine methiodide (2) and xanthoplanine iodide (3), with free hydroxyl groups at C-2 or C-9, respectively, had the highest affinity at these receptors (K-i approximate to 1 mu M), while the affinity of the diphenolic boldine methiodide (1) was intermediate between these values. At homomeric alpha 7 nAChR, xanthoplanine had the highest affinity (K-i = 10 mu M) vs [(1251)]alpha-bungarotoxin while the other three compounds displaced the radioligand with K-i values between 15 and 21 mu M. At 100 mu M. all four compounds inhibited the responses of these receptors to EC50 concentrations of ACh. The effects of xanthoplanine iodide (3) were studied in more detail. Xanthoplanine fully inhibited the EC50 ACh responses of both alpha 7 and alpha 4 beta 2 nACh receptors with estimated IC50 values of 9 +/- 3 mu M (alpha 7) and 5 +/- 0.8 mu M (alpha 4 beta 2).

A flow cytometric binding assay is described for the hY(2) receptor stably expressed in CHO cells using cy5-labeled porcine neuropeptide Y and compared with a radioligand binding assay. Binding of the fluorescent ligand was visualized by confocal microscopy. Stable co-transfection with the chimeric G protein Gq(i5) enabled the establishment of a spectrofluorimetric, fura-2 and a flow cytometric fluo-4 calcium assay. Further stable expression of apoaequorin targeted to the mitochondria allowed the establishment of an aequorin assay which could be performed in the 96-well format. The shape of the concentration-response curves of porcine neuropeptide Y in the presence of the Y-2-selective receptor antagonist BIIE0246, characteristic of either competitive or insurmountable antagonism, depended on the period of incubation with the cells. Functional data of Y, receptor agonists and antagonists determined in the fluorescence- and luminescence-based assays were in good agreement. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Young, DH; Rubio, FM; Danis, PO				Young, DH; Rubio, FM; Danis, PO			A radioligand binding assay for antitubulin activity in tumor cells	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Article						tubulin; benzamide; RH-5854; cell-based binding assay; tumor cells	2,4-DICHLOROBENZYL THIOCYANATE; TUBULIN; INHIBITION; MECHANISM; INTERACT; AGENT	The benzamide RH-5854 is shown to be highly potent toward tumor cells and to arrest nuclear division by a highly specific covalent binding to the P-subunit of tubulin in the colchicine binding region. Binding of H-3-RH-5854 to beta-tubulin in HCT-116 colon cancer cells is saturable and has been exploited in the development of a cell-based competitive binding assay, which allows antitubulin effects to be detected in whole cells. (3)-RH-5854 binding is strongly inhibited by preincubating the cells with compounds that bind to the colchicine site and with paclitaxel. Binding of H-3-5854 is enhanced by preincubating the cells with vinblastine but not by other agents that bind at or near the vinblastine site (ansamitocin P-3 and phomopsin A). Various cytotoxic agents that do not act on tubulin do not affect binding of H-3-RH-5854 in HCT-116 cells, demonstrating specificity of the assay for detection of antitubulin activity. As an alternative to traditional assays that employ isolated brain tubulin, the H-3-RH-5854 binding assay enables screening for antitubulin effects directly in tumor cells, providing an assay that accounts for cell-specific criteria that influence sensitivity such as different tubulin isotypes, tubulin mutations, drug metabolism, and efflux mechanisms.

It has been established that glucocorticoid down-regulate GR. Ginsenosides (GSS) front extract of Panax gingseng have demonstrated glucocorticoid-like activities in homeostasis and regulation of immunity. etc. We hypothesize that ginsenosides might mediate some of their actions by binding to the GR. The present study is aimed to determine whether GSS can act like a GC analog in the activation of glucocorticoid response element-luciferase activity in HL7702 cells. We found that GSS alone had no effect on the expression of reporter gene, but it enhanced dexamethasone (Dex)-induced transcription of reporter gene. To further explore the effects of GSS, we examined the influence of GSS on the gene and protein expression as well as hormone binding activity of GR by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, Western blot, and radioligand-binding assay, respectively. GSS partially reversed the Dex-induced decrease in GR expression and hormone binding activity with an optimal dose of 25 mug/ml, implicating a positive regulatory effect of GSS on GR expression and binding activity. Therefore, our result suggests that GSS may reverse partially the dexamethasone-induced down-regulation of glucocorticoid receptor. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cyanoguanidines such as pinacidil and P1075 bind to SUR and enhance MgATP binding to and hydrolysis by SUR, thereby opening K-ATP channels. In the vasculature, openers of K-ATP channels produce vasorelaxation. Some novel eyanoguanidines, however, selectively reverse opener-induced vasorelaxation, suggesting that they might be K-ATP channel blockers. Here we have analyzed the interaction of the enantiomers of a racemic cyanoguanidine blocker, PNU-94750, with Kir6.2/SUR channels. In patch clamp experiments, the R-enantiomer (PNU-96293) inhibited Kir6.2/SUR2 channels (IC50 similar to50 nm in the whole cell configuration), whereas the S-enantiomer (PNU-96179) was a weak opener. Radioligand binding studies showed that the R-enantiomer was more potent and that it was negatively allosterically coupled to MgATP binding, whereas the S-enantiomer was weaker and positively coupled. Binding experiments also suggested that both enantiomers bound to the P1075 site of SUR. This is the first report to show that the enantiomers of a K-ATP channel modulator affect channel activity and coupling to MgATP binding in opposite directions and that these opposite effects are apparently mediated by binding to the same (opener) site of SUR.

D-4 receptor binding was increased by up to 47% in denervated caudate-putamen (CPu) in rats that rotated away from the lesioned side with apomorphine challenge, with lesser changes in rats that failed to rotate with apomorphine. Functional significance of D-4 receptor upregulation induced by the lesions was investigated by examining behavioral effects of the highly selective D-4 agonist CP-226,269 and antagonist CP-293,019. Neither agent induced rotation at doses as high as 30 mg/kg ip. Pretreatment with the D-4 antagonist CP-293,019 did not affect rotation induced by either a D-1-like (SKF-38393) or D-2-like receptor (quinpirole) agonist. These findings provide the first evidence that Dq receptors can be upregulated by nigrostriatal dopaminergic denervation. They also suggest that, unlike D-1 and D-2 receptors, D-4 receptors do not play a pivotal role in rotational behavior in rats with unilateral dopaminergic lesions. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Several animal models of depression have been introduced, however, only a few have been extensively validated. In the present study we report the results of investigations into monoaminergic receptors in the brain of rats subjected to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) procedure (one of the well validated animal models of depression). We have examined the dopaminergic (D-l, D-2), adrenergic (alpha -1, beta -1) and serotonergic (5HT-1A, 5HT-2A) receptors in different brain regions by a saturation radioligand binding method in rats subjected to CUS paradigm and control animals. CUS procedure resulted in a significant 29% increase in the D-l receptor density in the limbic system and 52% increase of the density of 5HT-2A receptors in the cerebral cortex. The present data indicate that the increase of the density of brain D-l and 5HT-2A receptors of rats subjected to CUS might be involved in the pathophysiology of "animal depression" (since chronic antidepressant treatment produced opposite changes i.e. decrease in the density of these receptors) and thus in pathophysiology of human depression.

The dopamine transporter (DAT) plays a critical role in regulating dopamine concentration at the synaptic cleft and therefore could have an important role in the molecular pathology of MDD and BD. To test this hypothesis, we measured levels of [3Hlmazindol binding to DAT in Brodmann's area (BA) 10, BA 17 as well as in the dorsal and ventral striatum from 15 controls, 15 patients with MDD and 15 patients with BD, obtained postmortem, using in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography. Compared to controls, levels of [3Hlmazindol binding to DAT was significantly higher in BA10 from patients with MDD but not BD. There was no significant difference in [3Hlmazindol binding to DAT in BA 17 or the dorsal and ventral striatum from patients with MDD or BD. In addition, levels of [3Hlmazindol binding show no correlation with donor age, postmortem interval, tissue pH, sex or duration of illness. In conclusion, our data suggest that changes in levels of DAT may be selectively affecting dopamine homeostasis in BA 10 in patients with MDD.

These compounds were characterized by radioligand binding and GTP shift assays to determine the degree and type of binding affinity, respectively, against rat (r) A(1) and A(2A) ARs. The chalcone derivatives 24, 29, 37 and 38 possessed selective A(1) affinity below 10 mu M, and thus, are the most active compounds of the present series; compound 38 was the most potent selective A(1) AR antagonist (K-i (r) = 1.6 mu M). The structure-affinity relationships (SAR) revealed that the NH2-group at position C3 of ring A of the chalcone scaffold played a key role in affinity, and also, the Br-atom at position C3 ' on benzylidene ring B. Upon in vitro and in silico evaluation, the novel C3 amino-substituted chalcone derivative 38-that contains an alpha,ss-unsaturated carbonyl system and easily allows structural modification-may possibly be a synthon in future drug discovery.

New 2-Aminothiazoline derivatives lower blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) via I<sub>1</sub>-imidazoline and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors activation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Imidazoline receptor; Aminothiazoline; Hypertension; PC12 cells; Binding assay	IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTORS; ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS; ENDOGENOUS LIGAND; AGMATINE; PHARMACOLOGY; HYPOTENSION; MECHANISMS; MOXONIDINE; CLONIDINE; CHEMISTRY	2-Aminothiazolines share an isosteric relationship with imidazolines and oxazolines with antihypertensive activity mainly mediated by the imidazoline I-1-receptor. In the present work, we have prepared five aminothiazolines, following a previously described synthetic pathway. Aminothiazolines derived from dicyclo-propylmethylamine (ATZ1) and cyclohexylamine (3) are unprecedented in the literature. Competitive radioligand assay was carried out with all synthetic compounds, and the I-1 receptor affinity in comparison to rilmenidine in PC12 cells was determined. Surprisingly, the rilmenidine isoster (ATZ1) showed no I-1-receptor interaction. Diethyl (ATZ4) and 2-ethyl-hexylamine (ATZ5) derivatives bind to the receptor with 11.98 and 10.94 nmol/l, respectively. These compounds were selected for in vivo experiments. Both compounds reduced the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). The hypotensive effect of these compounds was abrogated in the presence of a(2) adrenergic (yohimbine) and I-1 (efaroxan) receptor antagonists suggesting that both aminothiazolines bind to the adrenergic and imidazoline receptors. Lipinski's descriptors of the synthesized aminothiazolines were calculated and are similar to the known imidazoline I-1 receptor ligands. 3D-Similarity between ATZ5 and agmatine, the natural imidazoline receptor ligand, was also observed.

Comparative assessment of parametric neuroreceptor mapping approaches based on the simplified reference tissue model using [<SUP>11</SUP>C]ABP688 PET	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						neuroreceptor imaging; parametric image; simplified reference tissue model; total least squares; tracer kinetic modeling	GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR SUBTYPE-5; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DYNAMIC PET; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; IN-VIVO; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; LINEAR-REGRESSION; C-11-ABP688; MGLUR5; LIGAND	In recent years, several linearized model approaches for fast and reliable parametric neuroreceptor mapping based on dynamic nuclear imaging have been developed from the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) equation. All the methods share the basic SRTM assumptions, but use different schemes to alleviate the effect of noise in dynamic-image voxels. Thus, this study aimed to compare those approaches in terms of their performance in parametric image generation. We used the basis function method and MRTM2 (multilinear reference tissue model with two parameters), which require a division process to obtain the distribution volume ratio (DVR). In addition, a linear model with the DVR as a model parameter (multilinear SRTM) was used in two forms: one based on linear least squares and the other based on extension of total least squares (TLS). Assessment using simulated and actual dynamic [C-11]ABP688 positron emission tomography data revealed their equivalence with the SRTM, except for different noise susceptibilities. In the DVR image production, the two multilinear SRTM approaches achieved better image quality and regional compatibility with the SRTM than the others, with slightly better performance in the TLS-based method.

Lestaurtinib was used as a model compound to determine the operational parameters of the LRSC. Of all the factors considered, the particle size of column packing, the column temperature and the flow rate were of immense importance in determining the performance of the established LRSC system. In order to profoundly comprehend the binding interaction between the model drug and the receptors on the column, thermodynamic studies were employed. The results revealed that the interaction was spontaneous and exothermic, a typical enthalpy-driven process. Additionally, the primary forces were hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forces. In evaluating the applicability of the method, active extracts from Albizziae Cortex were screened out using the LRSC system under the optimized conditions. The bioactive components were successfully confirmed by the MTT assay. In conclusion, it could be said that the LRSC is a good model for screening potential antitumor agents because of its viability, rapid response and scalable features.

Functional selectivity of adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptor ligands?	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Adenosine; Adenosine A(1) receptor; Functional selectivity; Biased signaling; GTP gamma S; Beta-arrestin	ARRESTIN-BIASED AGONISM; HIGH-AFFINITY; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; HIGH-POTENCY; DERIVATIVES; ANALOGS; ANTAGONISTS; PROFILE; A(2A); INTERNALIZATION	The concept of functional selectivity offers great potential for the development of drugs that selectively activate a specific intracellular signaling pathway. During the last few years, it has become possible to systematically analyse compound libraries on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) for this 'biased' form of signaling. We screened over 800 compounds targeting the class of adenosine A(1) receptors using a beta-arrestin-mediated signaling assay in U2OS cells as a G protein-independent readout for GPCR activation. A selection of compounds was further analysed in a G protein-mediated GTP gamma S assay. Additionally, receptor affinity of these compounds was determined in a radioligand binding assay with the agonist [H-3]CCPA. Of all compounds tested, only LUF5589 9 might be considered as functionally selective for the G protein-dependent pathway, particularly in view of a likely overestimation of beta-arrestin signaling in the U2OS cells. Altogether, our study shows that functionally selective ligands for the adenosine A(1) receptor are rare, if existing at all. A thorough analysis of biased signaling on other GPCRs also reveals that only very few compounds can be considered functionally selective. This might indicate that the concept of functional selectivity is less common than speculated.

Twenty-four inpatients with a first acute schizophrenic episode were enrolled in the study; 12 of these patients were treated with haloperidol for 2 weeks before dual-isotope SPECT was performed, whereas the other 12 patients underwent the SPECT evaluation directly after enrollment. Twelve healthy control persons were also recruited and evaluated with the dual-isotope SPECT protocol. Psychopathology was assessed by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and other scales. D2-radioligand binding did not differ between drug-na < ve patients and the control group but was significantly lower in the haloperidol-treated group. DAT availability was also significantly lower in the haloperidol patients than in the other two groups and differed significantly between drug-na < ve, positive-syndrome-type patients and healthy controls. The data obtained with the new dual-isotope SPECT technique reveal a direct effect of haloperidol at the D2 and DAT receptor level.	[Schmitt, G. J.

Toward Rational Design of Protein Detergent Complexes: Determinants of Mixed Micelles That Are Critical for the In Vitro Stabilization of a G-Protein Coupled Receptor	BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							ADENOSINE A(2)A RECEPTOR; MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; AQUEOUS-SOLUTIONS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; STRUCTURAL BIOLOGY; PHASE-BEHAVIOR; A(2A) RECEPTOR; CRYSTALLIZATION	Although reconstitution of membrane proteins within protein detergent complexes is often used to enable their structural or biophysical characterization, it is unclear how one should rationally choose the appropriate micellar environment to preserve native protein folding. Here, we investigated model mixed micelles consisting of a nonionic glucosylated alkane surfactant from the maltoside and thiomaltoside families, bile salt surfactant, and the steryl derivative cholesteryl hemisuccinate. We correlated several key attributes of these micelles with the in vitro ligand-binding activity of hA(2)aR in these systems. Through small-angle neutron scattering and radioligand-binding analysis, we found several key aspects of mixed micellar systems that preserve the activity of hA(2)aR, including a critical amount of cholesteryl hemisuccinate per micelle, and an optimal hydrophobic thickness of the micelle that is analogous to the thickness of native mammalian bilayers. These features are closely linked to the headgroup chemistry of the surfactant and the hydrocarbon chain length, which influence both the morphology and composition of resulting micelles. This study should serve as a general guide for selecting the appropriate mixed surfactant systems to stabilize membrane proteins for biophysical analysis.

Optimization of the reaction parameters time, temperature, solvent and concentration gave a radiochemical yield of 38 +/- 8% at 180 degrees C in dimethylsulphoxide within 30-min reaction time. After a solid-phase extraction followed by a high-performance liquid chromatography separation, the product could be obtained in radiochemical yields of 5 +/- 1.5%. Radiochemical purity was higher than 95% and the specific activity amounted to 77 +/- 40 GBq/mu mol. First in vitro assays with rat brain slices revealed a high non-specific binding and a uniform distribution of [F-18]8 not lending it for in vivo imaging purposes.

It mediates signaling via the interaction with a stimulatory G-protein. Especially, the third intracellular loop (iL3) of 5-HT6 and the alpha subunit of stimulatory G protein (G alpha(s)) are responsible for the signaling process of 5-HT6. Chemical compounds that could inhibit the interaction between the iL3 region of 5-HT6 and Get, were screened from a chemical library consisted of 5,600 synthetic compounds. One of the identified compounds bound to G alpha(s) and effectively blocked the interaction between G alpha(s) and the iL3 region of 5-HT6. The identified compound was further shown to reduce the serotonin-induced accumulation of cAMP in 293T cells transformed with 5-HT6 cDNA. It also lowered the Ca2+ efflux induced by serotonin in cells expressing 5-HT6 and chimeric G alpha(s5/q). These results indicate that the interaction between the iL3 of 5-HT6 and G alpha(s) can be exploited for screening of regulatory compounds against the signaling pathway of 5-HT6.

Upregulation of opioid receptor binding following spontaneous epileptic seizures	BRAIN			English	Article						temporal lobe epilepsy; opioids; neurotransmission; anterior temporal lobe; positron emission tomography	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; MU-OPIATE RECEPTORS; ENDOGENOUS OPIOIDS; ANIMAL-MODEL; RAT-BRAIN; PET; QUANTIFICATION; ORIPAVINES; DYNORPHIN	Animal and limited human data suggest an important anticonvulsant role for opioid peptides and their receptors. We aimed to provide direct human in vivo evidence for changes in opioid receptor availability following spontaneous seizures. We scanned nine patients within hours of spontaneous temporal lobe seizures and compared their postictal binding of the non-subtype selective opioid receptor PET radioligand [(11)C]diprenorphine (DPN), quantified as a volume-of-distribution (VD), with interictal binding and with binding changes in 14 healthy controls, controlling for a range of behavioural variables associated with opioid action. A regionally specific increase of opioid receptor availability was evident in the temporal pole and fusiform gyrus ipsilateral to the seizure focus following seizures (Z 5.01, P < 0.001, 16 432 mm(3)). Within this region, there was a negative correlation between VD and log10 time since last seizure (r = -0.53, P < 0.03), compatible with an early increase and gradual return to baseline. [(11)C]DPN VD did not undergo systematic changes between time points in controls. This study provides direct human in vivo evidence for changes in opioid receptor availability over a time course of hours following spontaneous seizures, emphasizing an important role of the opioid system in seizure control.

We used radioligand binding, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence techniques to examine the properties of wild-type alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) and mutant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)R43Q GABARs expressed in HEK 293 cells. The gamma(2)R43Q mutation had no affect on the binding affinity of the benzodiazepine flunitrazepam. However, in cells expressing alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)R43Q GABARs, the number of binding sites for [H-3]flunitrazepam relative to wild-type receptors was decreased 75%. Using surface protein biotinylation, affinity purification, and immunoblotting, we demonstrated that expression of cell surface alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)R43Q GABARs was decreased. Surface immunostaining of HEK 293 cells expressing alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2)R43Q GABARs confirmed that surface expression of the gamma(2)R43Q subunit was reduced. These data demonstrate that the gamma(2)R43Q mutation impairs expression of cell surface GABARs. A deficit in surface GABAR expression would reduce synaptic inhibition and result in neuronal hyperexcitability, which could explain why families possessing the gamma(2)R43Q subunit have epilepsy.

Relapsed or refractory hematopoietic cancers are frequently resistant to conventional therapy, and novel highly active strategies are urgently needed. CXCR4-directed endoradiotherapy constitutes a highly promising targeted therapeutic concept. Here, we investigated the adverse effects of this novel treatment approach. Methods: Twenty-two patients with heavily pretreated lymphoproliferative or myeloid malignancies were treated with Lu-177-or Y-90-pentixather-a CXCR4-directed therapeutic radioligand-before conventional conditioning therapy followed by autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Twenty-five CXCR4-directed endoradiotherapies were administered to those patients. Adverse events occurring between endoradiotherapy and the start of conventional conditioning therapy were retrospectively analyzed and graded for the estimation of the safety profile. Results: CXCR4-directed endoradiotherapy with pentixather showed a favorable toxicity profile. As expected, the hematopoietic system was most affected, with all subjects developing cytopenias. Except for 1 acute kidney failure, grade 3, due to tumor lysis syndrome, overall nephro-and hepatotoxicity was low. Other higher-grade adverse events were either transient and resolved or easily manageable. Conclusion: Therapy with radiolabeled pentixather appears to be well tolerated and easily applicable when preceding conventional conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

In particular, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have attracted increasing interest since they affect cellular signaling. Furthermore, mutations in GPCRs can cause acquired and inheritable diseases. Up to date, there still exist a number of GPCRs that has not been structurally and functionally analyzed due to difficulties in cell-based membrane protein production. A promising approach for membrane protein synthesis and analysis has emerged during the last years and is known as cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS). Here, we describe a simply portable method to synthesize GPCRs and analyze their ligand-binding properties without the requirement of additional supplements such as liposomes or nanodiscs. This method is based on eukaryotic cell lysates containing translocationally active endogenous endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes where the insertion of GPCRs into biologically active membranes is supported. In this study we present CFPS in combination with fast fluorescence-based screening methods to determine the localization, orientation and ligand-binding properties of the endothelin B (ET-B) receptor upon expression in an insect-based cell-free system. To determine the functionality of the cell-free synthesized ET-B receptor, we analyzed the binding of its ligand endothelin-1 (ET-1) in a qualitative fluorescence-based assay and in a quantitative radioligand binding assay.

In this study, we measured ONO-2952 brain TSPO occupancy in conscious rhesus monkeys using positron emission tomography (PET) with C-11-PBR28 as ligand for translational research to clinical application. PET scans were performed after single and repeated oral administration of ONO-2952 at several dose levels for each animal, with sequential arterial blood sampling. In vitro binding studies showed that ONO-2952 potently binds to brain TSPO in monkeys with an affinity equivalent to that in rats. ONO-2952, given orally before PET scans, dose dependently decreased C-11-PBR28 uptake without marked brain region specificity. Results of the quantitative analysis using arterial input function revealed that TSPO occupancy after ONO-2952 single and repeated oral administration tended to increase in parallel with its plasma concentration, reaching the highest level of 100%. These findings indicate that ONO-2952 has sufficient brain distribution in primates and that ONO-2952 TSPO occupancy in humans can also be determined using PET.

A significant increase in affinity was observed for the quaternized analogues over the parent 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds. Interestingly, the impact of stereochemistry was not the same in the two groups of compounds. For quaternized analogues, affinities of S,S and R,R isomers for SK2 and SK3 channels were similar and in both cases higher than that of the meso derivative. Among the bis-tetrahydroisoquinoline compounds, the S,S isomers exhibited high affinity, while the R,R and meso isomers had similarly lower affinities. Furthermore, the SK2/SK3 selectivity ratio was slightly increased for quaternized analogues. Bis-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinolinium) represents a new scaffold for the development of high-affinity ligands for SK channel subtypes.

Structural basis for modulation of a G-protein-coupled receptor by allosteric drugs	NATURE			English	Article							MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; FORCE-FIELD; SUBTYPE SELECTIVITY; AMINO-ACIDS; SITE; DYNAMICS; BINDING; IDENTIFICATION; LIGANDS; TRANSMEMBRANE	The design of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) allosteric modulators, an active area of modern pharmaceutical research, has proved challenging because neither the binding modes nor the molecular mechanisms of such drugs are known(1,2). Here we determine binding sites, bound conformations and specific drug-receptor interactions for several allosteric modulators of the M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 receptor), a prototypical family A GPCR, using atomic-level simulations in which the modulators spontaneously associate with the receptor. Despite substantial structural diversity, all modulators form cation-p interactions with clusters of aromatic residues in the receptor extracellular vestibule, approximately 15 angstrom from the classical, 'orthosteric' ligand-binding site. We validate the observed modulator binding modes through radioligand binding experiments on receptor mutants designed, on the basis of our simulations, either to increase or to decrease modulator affinity. Simulations also revealed mechanisms that contribute to positive and negative allosteric modulation of classical ligand binding, including coupled conformational changes of the two binding sites and electrostatic interactions between ligands in these sites. These observations enabled the design of chemical modifications that substantially alter a modulator's allosteric effects. Our findings thus provide a structural basis for the rational design of allosteric modulators targeting muscarinic and possibly other GPCRs.

Preclinical Evaluation of [99m]Tc-Labeled Doxorubicin as a Potential Scintigraphic Probe for Tumor Imaging	CANCER BIOTHERAPY AND RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						cancer; imaging; molecular imaging; radionuclide; radiopharmaceuticals	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CELL LUNG-CANCER; PET; CHEMOTHERAPY; ACCUMULATION; MASSES; TL-201; DRUGS	Background: The currently available radiopharmaceuticals are not specific for tumor imaging. Purpose: The present study was conducted to radiolabel doxorubicin with Technetium-99m ([99m]Tc) as a scintigraphic marker of high DNA turnover/intercalation in malignant cells. Methods: Labeling was done by direct method and the developed radiotracer was subjected to quality control tests. The blood kinetics, scintigraphy of tumor-bearing mice, and biodistribution were studied after intravenous injection of about 7.4MBq of [99m]Tc-doxorubicin. The isotime (5 minutes) anterior images were acquired at different time intervals of 1.5, 3, and 4 hours. Results: The labeling efficiency of [99m]Tc-doxorubicin was estimated to be more than 95%. The protein-binding efficiency was greater than 88% and in vitro stability was up to 24 hours. The biodistribution data support the clearance of the radioligand by dual (renal and hepatic) pathways. A semiquantitative data analysis of the anterior images indicated that a focal concentration of the radiotracer was seen in the tumor at 1.5 hours, which persisted in 3-hour and 4-hour images, respectively. Conclusions: This scintigraphic approach, therefore, could be a powerful tool for cancer detection at early stage. The technique, however, needs further validation through animal experimentation and clinical studies.

In general, reported CRF1 receptor antagonists possess a sp(2)-nitrogen atom as hydrogen bonding acceptor (HBA) on their core scaffolds. We proposed to use a carbonyl group of pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives as a replacement for the sp(2)-nitrogen atom as HBA in classical CRF1 receptor antagonists. As a result, several pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives showed CRF1 receptor binding affinity with IC50 values in the submicromolar range. Ex vivo I-125-sauvagine binding studies showed that 2-(dipropylamino)-3,7-dimethyl-5-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)-3,7-dihydro-4H-pyrrolo [2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-one (16b) (30 mg/kg, po) was able to penetrate into the brain and inhibit radioligand binding to CRF1 receptors (frontal cortex, olfactory bulb, and pituitary) in mice. We identified pyrrolo[2,3-d] pyrimidin-4-one derivatives as the first CRF1 antagonists with a carbonyl-based HBA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In vitro competition binding assays demonstrated that compounds 9-12 have a high affinity for the DAT and are selective for the DAT compared to the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters. MicroPET imaging with [F-18]9 [F-18]11 in anesthetized cynomolgus monkeys showed high uptake in the putamen with lesser uptake in the caudate, but significant washout of the radiotracer was only observed for [F-18]9. PET imaging with [E-18]9 in an awake rhesus monkey showed high and nearly equal uptake in both the putamen and caudate with peak uptake achieved after 20 min followed by a leveling-off for about 10 min and then a steady washout and attainment of a quasi-equilibrium. During the time period 40-80 min postinjection of [F-18]9, the ratio of uptake in the putamen and caudate vs cerebellum uptake was a >= 4.

Solid-state NMR spectroscopy is an excellent method to study structure and dynamics of membrane proteins in their native lipid environment. We developed a reconstitution protocol for the uniformly N-15 labeled Y-2 receptor into a bicelle-like lipid structure with high yields suitable for NMR studies. Milligram quantities of target protein were expressed in Escherichia coli using an optimized fermentation process in defined medium yielding in over 10 mg/L medium of purified Y-2 receptor solubilized in SDS micelles. The structural integrity of the receptor molecules was strongly increased through refolding and subsequent reconstitution into phospholipid membranes. Specific ligand binding to the integrated receptor was determined using radioligand affinity assay. Further, by NMR measurement a dispersion of the N-15 signals comparable to native rhodopsin was shown. The efficiency of the reconstitution could also be inferred from the fact that reasonable C-13 NMR spectra at natural abundance could be acquired. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hence, appropriate PET radioligands for MMP imaging are required. Here, we describe the syntheses of novel fluorinated MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) based on lead structures of the broad-spectrum inhibitors N-hydroxy-2(R)-[[(4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl](benzyl)-amino]-3-methyl-butanamide (CGS 25966) and N-hydroxy-2(R)-[[(4-methoxyphenyl)sulfonyl](3-picolyl)-amino]-3-methyl-butanamide (CGS 27023A). Additionally, tailor-made precursor compounds for radiolabeling with the positron-emitter F-18 were synthesized. All prepared hydroxamate target compounds showed high in vitro MMP inhibition potencies for MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-13. As a consequence, the promising fluorinated hydroxamic acid derivative if was resynthesized in its F-18-labeled version via two different procedures yielding the potential PET radioligand [F-18]1f. As expected, the biodistribution behavior of this novel compound and that of the more hydrophilic variant [F-18]1j, also developed by our group, indicates that there was no tissue specific accumulation in wild-type (WT) mice.

Our analyses indicated that disruption of plasma membrane microdomains by cholesterol depletion did not markedly influence the binding parameters of TRH receptors, but it altered efficacy of signal transduction. The functional coupling between TRH receptor and G(q/11)alpha was assessed by agonist-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, and results of these measurements pointed out to significantly lower potency of TRH to mediate G protein activation in the plasma membrane fraction isolated from cholesterol-depleted cells; there was a shift in sensitivity by one order of magnitude to the higher concentrations. A markedly lower sensitivity to stimulation with TRH was also observed in our experiments dealing with determination of hormone-induced Ca2+ response. These data suggest that the intact structure of plasma membranes is an important optimum signal transduction. initiated by TRH receptors and mediated by G(q/11)alpha proteins.

J	Price, KL; Lummis, SCR				Price, KL; Lummis, SCR			The role of tyrosine residues in the extracellular domain of the 5-hydroxytryptamine<sub>3</sub> receptor	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; LIGAND-BINDING DOMAIN; AGONIST-BINDING; 5-HT3 RECEPTOR; SUBUNIT; SITE; IDENTIFICATION; ANTAGONISTS; GAMMA; CONDUCTANCE	Aromatic residues play an important role in the ligand-binding domain of Cys loop receptors. Here we examine the role of the 11 tyrosines in this domain of the 5-HT3 receptor in ligand binding and receptor function by substituting them for alanine, for serine, and, for some residues, also for phenylalanine. The mutant receptors were expressed in HEK293 cells and Xenopus oocytes and examined using radioligand binding, Ca2+ imaging, electrophysiology, and immunochemistry. The data suggest that Tyr(50) and Tyr(91) are critical for receptor assembly and/or structure, Tyr(141) is important for antagonist binding and/or the structure of the binding pocket, Tyr(143) plays a critical role in receptor gating and/or agonist binding, and Tyr(153) and Tyr(234) are involved in ligand binding and/or receptor gating. Tyr(73), Tyr(88), Tyr(94), Tyr(167), and Tyr(240) do not appear to play major roles either in the structure of the extracellular domain or in ligand binding. The data support the location of these residues on a model of 5-HT docked into the ligand-binding domain and also provide evidence for the structural similarity of the extracellular domain to AChBP and the homologous regions of other Cys loop ligand-gated ion channels.

J	Gupte, J; Cutler, G; Chen, JL; Tian, H				Gupte, J; Cutler, G; Chen, JL; Tian, H			Elucidation of signaling properties of vasopressin receptor-related receptor 1 by using the chimeric receptor approach	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; IDENTIFICATION; ALIGNMENT	The identification of endogenous or surrogate ligands for orphan G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represents one of the most important tasks in GPCR biology and pharmacology. The challenge lies in choosing an appropriate assay in the absence of ways to activate the receptor of interest. We investigated the signaling pathway for an orphan GPCR referred to here as vasopressin receptor-related receptor 1 (VRR1) by generating a chimeric receptor, V1a/VRR1. The engineered construct contained vasopressin V1a receptor with all three intracellular loops and C terminus replaced by those of VRR1. The chimera behaved like a typical GPCR when transiently and stably expressed in mammalian cell lines based on radioligand binding and receptor internalization studies. Upon arginine vasopressin stimulation, this chimeric receptor induced robust calcium mobilization and increase of adenylate cyclase activity. The observed signaling activities are through the activation of the chimera instead of enclogenously expressed receptors, as single amino acid changes in the second transmembrane regions of the chimera drastically reduced receptor efficacy and potency. Our results suggest that VRR1 has dual signaling properties in coupling to both G(q) and G(s) pathways. Analysis of native VRR1 receptor signaling pathway by using a recently identified ligand for VRR1 confirmed this conclusion and therefore validated the utility of the chimeric receptor approach for signaling pathway identification.

In the present communication, we report that conjugates of deoxycholic acid (DC) act as cholinergic muscarinic receptor antagonists. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing rat M3-muscarinic receptors were used to test bile acids for inhibition of radioligand [N-H-3-methylscopolamine (H-3-NMS)] binding; alteration of inositol phosphate (IP) formation; mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphorylation and cell toxicity. We observed approximately 18.8, 30.3 and 37.1% inhibition of 3H-NMS binding with DC and its glycine (DCG) and taurine (DCT) conjugates, respectively (all 100 mumol/l, p < 0.01). DCT and DCG inhibited acetylcholine-induced increases in IP formation and MAP kinase phosphorylation (p44 and p42 ERK). DCG and DCT did not alter trypan blue exclusion or lactate dehydrogenase release from CHO-M3 cells. We observed the following rank order of potency (IC50 μmol/l) for inhibition of 3H-NMS by muscarinic antagonists and bile acids: NMS (0.0004) > 4-DAMP (0.009) > atropine (0.012) > DCT (170) > DCG (250). None of the bile acids tested were hydrolyzed by recombinant cholinesterase. At concentrations achieved in human bile, DC derivatives are natural muscarinic antagonists. Copyright (C) 2002 S.

J	Owens, JM; Knight, DL; Nemeroff, CB				Owens, JM; Knight, DL; Nemeroff, CB			Second generation SSRIS: Human monoamine transporter binding profile of escitalopram and R-fluoxetine	ENCEPHALE-REVUE DE PSYCHIATRIE CLINIQUE BIOLOGIQUE ET THERAPEUTIQUE			French	Article						antidepressant; binding; enantiomer; escitalopram; R-fluoxetine; S-citalopram; serotonin; uptake	SEROTONIN-UPTAKE; CITALOPRAM ENANTIOMERS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; METABOLITES; RECEPTORS; NORFLUOXETINE; INHIBITORS; PLASMA	Background - Single isomers of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors citalopram (escitalopram, S-citalopram) and fluoxetine (R-fluoxetine) are currently under development for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric disorders. Previous studies conducted in laboratory animals have revealed that the biological effects on serotonin reuptake for citalopram reside in the S enantiomer. In contrast, both enantiomers of fluoxetine contribute to its biological activity. Methods - In the present study, the potency and selectivity of escitalopram, R-fluoxetine, and all of the other currently available selective serotonine reuptake ihibitors were compared for binding affinity at the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters and several select neurotransmitter receptors using radioligand binding assays, Results - Both escitalopram and R-fluoxetine were potent inhibitors of the serotonin transporter (Ki = 1, 1 and 1,4 nmoI/L, respectively). escitalopram was the most serotonin transporter-selective compound tested and was - 30 fold more potent than R-citalopram. Conclusions -As noted previously, paroxetine and sertraline possess moderate affinity (< 50 nmol/L) for the human norepinephrine transporter and dopamine transporter, respectively. R-fluoxetine, unlike the other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, possesses moderate affinity (Ki = 64 nmol/L) for the serotonin 2C receptor. Potential clinical correlates of these unique attributes of escitalopram and R-fluoxetine are discussed. (C) 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

A random sample of 200 persons (87 males, mean age 42.4 years) from Estonia including one patient with type I diabetes mellitus was studied. IgG-type glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) antibodies were determined using radioligand-binding assay and IgG/IgA-type gliadin antibodies (AGA) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Generic HLA-DRB1* alleles were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction. Although our results revealed the highest GAD65Ab index and a high IgA-type AGA in a person with diabetes, no correlation between GAD65Ab and AGA values was revealed among the other 199 persons (p > 0.05). There were also no differences between test values among persons with and without different HLA-DRB1* alleles (p > 0.05). In the GAD65Ab assay, one person (0.5%; 95% Cl: 0-1.5) out of 199 exceeded the 99(th) centile of the GAD65Ab index. In summary, the present study does not confirm the possibility that there is a relationship between the immune reactivity against GAD65 and gliadin, at least in persons without type I DM.

The emesis induced by 50 mg/kg of cisplatin was reduced by the oral pretreatment with tropisetron, which is known as a 5-HT3- and 5-HT4-receptor dual antagonist in vitro, with the ID50 value of 0.52 mg/kg. On the contrary, granisetron, a selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist, did not markedly inhibit the emesis at up to 30 mg/kg. Moreover, GR125487, a selective 5-HT4-receptor antagonist, did not inhibit the emesis. However, co-administration of GR125487 and granisetron significantly reduced the number of emetic episodes. The study of the co-administration of GR125487 with tropisetron showed that GR125487 did not further enhance the inhibitory effect of tropisetron alone, suggesting that the anti-emetic effect of tropisetron is mediated via the blockade of both 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors. These results suggest that both the 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors are involved in the emesis induced by the high-dose of cisplatin in Suncus murinus.

Since studies have indicated that flavonoids can target brain GPCRs and provide neuroprotection via inhibition of monoamine oxidases (hMAOs), our study explored the functional role of kurarinone, an abundant lavandulated flavonoid in Sophora flavescens, on dopamine receptor subtypes, V1AR, 5-HT1AR, and hMAOs. Radioligand binding assays revealed considerable binding of kurarinone on D1R, D2LR, and D4R. Functional GPCR assays unfolded the compound's antagonist behavior on D1R (IC50 42.1 +/- 0.35 mu M) and agonist effect on D2LR and D4R (EC50 22.4 +/- 3.46 and 71.3 +/- 4.94 mu M, respectively). Kurarinone was found to inhibit hMAO isoenzymes in a modest and nonspecific manner. Molecular docking displayed low binding energies during the intermolecular interactions of kurarinone with the key residues of the deep orthosteric binding pocket and the extracellular loops of D1R, D2LR, and D4R, validating substantial binding affinities to these prime targets. With appreciable D2LR and D4R agonism and D1R antagonism, kurarinone might be a potential compound that can alleviate clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease and other NDDs.

Dysfunction of MAGL has been associated with multiple CNS disorders and symptoms, including neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment, epileptogenesis, nociception and neurodegenerative diseases. Inhibition of MAGL provides a promising therapeutic direction for the treatment of these conditions, and a MAGL positron emission tomography (PET) probe would greatly facilitate preclinical and clinical development of MAGL inhibitors. Herein, we design and synthesize a small library of fluoropyridyl-containing MAGL inhibitor candidates. Pharmacological evaluation of these candidates by activity-based protein profiling identified 14 as a lead compound, which was then radiolabeled with fluorine-18 via a facile SNAr reaction to form 2-[F-18]fluoropyridine scaffold. Good blood-brain barrier permeability and high in vivo specific binding was demonstrated for radioligand [F-18]14 (also named as [F-18]MAGL-1902).

Starting from the argininamide core bearing amine-functionalized spacer moieties, a series of fluoropropanoylated and fluorobenzoylated derivatives was synthesized and studied for Y-1,R affinity. The fluoropropanoylated derivative 23 displayed high affinity (K-i = 1.3 nM) and selectivity toward Y1R Radiosynthesis was accomplished via F-18-fluoropropanoylation, yielding [F-18]23 with excellent stability in mice; however, the biodistribution study revealed pronounced hepatobiliary clearance with high accumulation in the gall bladder (>100 %ID/g). Despite the unfavorable biodistribution, [F-18]123 was successfully used for imaging of Y,R positive MCF-7 tumors in nude mice. Therefore, we suggest [F-18]23 as a lead for the design of PET ligands with optimized physicochemical properties resulting in more favorable biodistribution and higher Y-1,R-dependent enrichment in mammary carcinoma.

Characterization of Insulin Antibodies by Surface Plasmon Resonance in Two Clinical Cases: Brittle Diabetes and Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AUTOANTIBODY MEASUREMENT; HYPOGLYCEMIA; RADIOIMMUNOASSAY; STANDARDIZATION; PROINSULIN; RESISTANCE; MELLITUS; CHILDREN; DISEASE; ASSAY	In this study, the characterization of insulin (auto) antibodies has been described, mainly in terms of concentration (q), affinity (K-a) and Ig (sub) isotypes by Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) in two particular clinical cases of individuals with severe episodes of impaired glycemia. Subject 1 suffers from brittle diabetes associated with circulating insulin antibodies (IA) due to insulin treatment. Subject 2 has insulin autoantibodies (IAA) associated with hypoglycemia in spite of not being diabetic and not having ever received exogenous insulin therapy. After conventional screening for IA/IAA by radioligand binding assay (RBA), we further characterized IA/IAA in sera of both patients in terms of concentration (q), affinity (K-a) and Ig (sub) isotypes by means of SPR technology. In both cases, q values were higher and K-a values were lower than those obtained in type 1 diabetic patients, suggesting that IA/IAA: insulin immunocomplexes could be responsible for the uncontrolled glycemia. Moreover, subject 1 had a predominat IgG(1) response and subject 2 had an IgG(3) response. In conclusion, SPR technology is useful for the complete characterization of IA/IAA which can be used in special cases where the simple positive/negative determination is not enough to achieve a detailed description of the disease fisiopathology.

Methods: We studied 12 patients with epilepsy (7 patients had focal and 5 had generalized epilepsy syndromes). The presence of self-reported symptoms of depression was assessed using Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q). The binding potential of the SERT was assessed by performing brain single photon emission tomography (SPET) using the SERT radioligand 2-((2-((dimethylamino) methyl) phenyl) thio)-5-(123) iodophenylamine (I-123-ADAM). Results: Seven patients had BDI and EST-Q subscale scores greater than 11 points, which was interpreted as the presence of symptoms of depression. We found that I-123-ADAM binding was not significantly different between patients with epilepsy with and without symptoms of depression. In addition, I-123-ADAM binding did not show a significant correlation to either BDI or EST-Q depression subscale scores and did not differ between patients with focal vs. generalized epilepsy. Conclusion: The results of our study failed to demonstrate alterations of SERT binding properties in patients with epilepsy with or without symptoms of depression.

Michael			The size of a melanin-based plumage ornament correlates with glucocorticoid receptor concentrations in the skin of that ornament	BIOLOGY LETTERS			English	Article						house sparrow; Passer domesticus; hypothalamus - pituitary - adrenal axis; corticosterone; plumage signal	MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR; STRESS-RESPONSE; EXPRESSION; SIGNALS; SYSTEM	Glucocorticoid hormones such as corticosterone (CORT) play crucial roles in many physiological processes. CORT's actions are primarily mediated via binding to two receptors (glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs)) in different target tissues. CORT receptors can be independently regulated from circulating hormone titres, from tissue to tissue and even within different regions of the same tissue type. Increasing evidence has shown relationships between circulating CORT and melanin-based pigmentation in skin and feathers, yet to our knowledge, there have been no studies of CORT receptors in the skin of melanized ornaments. Male house sparrows (Passer domesticus) have a black, melanized bib, and evidence suggests that bib size is an important intraspecific signal. We examined the relationship between bib area and tissue sensitivity to CORT by quantifying GR and MR in bib skin and in adjacent paler-feathered belly skin (as a control tissue) at different life-history stages using radioligand binding assays. Males with larger bibs relative to their life-history stage had less GR in bib skin, but not belly skin, than males with smaller bibs. These results suggest a connection between the size of a melanin-based ornament and the underlying tissue's responsiveness to CORT.	[Lattin, Christine R.; Romero, L.

An automated radiosynthesis of [F-18]-N-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl)-N-(4-phenoxypyridin-3-yl)acetamide ([F-18]FEPPA) was validated for human use using a commercial synthesis module and resulted in a high radiochemical yield (30%+/- 8%, uncorrected; n = 54) and specific activity (6 +/- 4 Ci/ mu mol). Tumor uptake of [F-18]FEPPA in mice bearing subcutaneous MDA-MB-231 BC xenografts was evaluated by PET-computed tomography imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies. Although the tumor was successfully visualized, ex vivo biodistribution studies revealed low tumor uptake (0.7%ID/g), with the majority of radioactivity distributed in the spleen, muscle, and heart despite high TSPO expression in this cell line. Our laboratory routinely prepares [F-18]FEPPA for human-imaging studies in the central nervous system, and we envision that radiopharmaceuticals that target the TSPO have the potential for imaging macrophages in the tumor microenvironment.

Plks are characterized by the presence of a highly conserved C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD) that is involved in regulating kinase activity. The phosphopeptide Pro-Leu-His-Ser-p-Thr (PLHSpT) is a potent selective inhibitor of the PBD of human plk1 that acts by inducing mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. We synthesized cRGDyK-S-S-CPLHSpT to exploit the drug delivery and molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET). The peptide was blocked dramatically proliferation of tumor in vitro and in vivo. It was attempted to develop and show a tumor PET image with the radiolabeled-peptide. Here we showed the peptide is promising not only as an anticancer drug, but also as a radioligand for tumor diagnosis with PET. We expect that our contribution will provide new insights into the design of Plk1 peptide inhibitors and have significant implications for anticancer therapy and tumor diagnosis.

Methods : We derived 5-HT2AR nondisplaceable binding potentials (BPND) in frontal, temporal, anterior-cingulate, insula, caudate and putamen volumes of interest (VOIs) for 28 healthy subjects (mean +/- SD age = 43.9 +/- 17.0 years, range: 19-78 years) using HRRT. Partial volume correction (PVC) was performed in the VOI analysis. Results : The 5-HT2AR BP(ND)s decreased with age, a relationship best described by an exponential-decay regression. The BPNDs were found to be consistent before and after PVC, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.84 and 95% confidence interval = 0.78-0.88. Conclusions : These new findings update current knowledge, in that the aging process is not always uniform across the life span and suggest that PVC may not be necessary with HRRT in healthy subjects.

Ciclesonide is activated to desisobutyryl-ciclesonide (des-CIC) in the lungs to provide potent anti-inflammatory activity. The investigations herein compared the activity of ciclesonide with fluticasone in animal models to assess efficacy/potency as an airway anti-inflammatory and the comparative side effect potential to consider the therapeutic ratio of each compound. In radioligand binding assays, des-CIC and fluticasone exhibited comparable high-affinity binding to the glucocorticoid receptor, whereas ciclesonide exhibited 100-fold less binding affinity. In the Brown Norway rat model of antigen-induced airway eosinophilia and in a model of Sephadex-induced lung edema, ciclesonide and fluticasone exhibited comparable efficacy. Interestingly, following 7-day intratracheal administration, ciclesonide elicited adrenal involution with a potency that was 44-fold less than fluticasone. Furthermore, ciclesonide was 22-fold less active than fluticasone in eliciting hypoplasia of the femoral growth plate. These data support the concept that ciclesonide acts as a parent compound that, when delivered to the airways, can be transformed into the active metabolite des-CIC, resulting in local high anti-inflammatory activity. Furthermore, ciclesonide possesses equivalent anti-inflammatory efficacy through pulmonary activation with a significantly improved safety profile in preclinical animal models compared with fluticasone.

Endogenous IgG accumulated upon neurons in the neocortex and caudate/putamen of infected mice and interacted with native and recombinant AMPA-receptor subunits with the following relative abundance: GluR3 greater than or equal to GluR1 > GluR2 = GluR4, as determined by immunoprecipitation. In a radioligand assay, IgG preparations from infected mice specifically inhibited [H-3]AMPA binding to receptors in brain homogenates, an activity that was lost after preadsorbing the IgG preparation to immobilized LP-BM5 virus. These IgGs also evoked currents when applied to hippocampal pyramidal neurons or to damaged cerebellar granule neurons. These currents could be blocked using any of several AMPA receptor antagonists. Thus, anti-AMPA-receptor Ab's can be produced as the result of a virus infection, in part through molecular mimicry. These Ab's may alter neuronal signaling and contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in these mice, actions that may be curtailed by the use of AMPA-receptor antagonists.

PET imaging of the (pre)synaptic vesicular glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) has de-monstrated a reduction in synapse density in AD in the hippocampus but not consistently in the neocortex. This investigation examines the level of [3H]UCB-J binding in postmortem cortical tissue from patients with AD and matched healthy controls using autoradiography. Among the neocortical areas examined, the binding was significantly lower only in the middle frontal gyrus in AD compared to matched controls. No differences were observed in the parietal, temporal, or occipital cortex. The binding levels in the frontal cortex in the AD cohort displayed large variability among subjects, and this revealed a highly significant negative association with the age of the patient. These results demonstrate low UCB-J binding in the frontal cortex of patients with AD, and this biomarker correlates negatively with age, which may further indicate that SV2A could be an important biomarker in AD patients. & COPY; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

In the past few years, adenosine A(2)A receptor (A(2)AR) antagonists have attracted much attention due to significant relief in PD. Therefore, in the current study, we intend to disclose the development of novel 1,3,5-triazines as A(2)AR antagonist. The radioligand binding and selectivity of analogs were tested in HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) and the cells were transfected with pcDNA 3.1(+) containing full-length human A(2)AR cDNA and pcDNA 3.1(+) containing full-length human A(1)R cDNA, where they exhibit selective affinity for A(2)AR. Molecular docking analysis was also conducted to rationalize the probable mode of action, binding affinity, and orientation of the most potent molecule (7c) at the active site of A(2)AR. It has been shown that compound 7c form numerous nonbonded interactions in the active site of A(2)AR by interacting with Ala59, Ala63, Ile80, Val84 Glu169, Phe168, Met270, and Ile274. The study revealed 1,3,5-triazines as a novel class of A(2)AR antagonists.

Neuroendocrine tumors occur in approximately in 5-15% of MEN1 patients. Very few cases of ovarian NETs have been reported in association with clinical MEN1 and without genetic testing confirmation. Thirty-three-year-old woman with MEN1 was found to have right adnexal mass on computed tomography (CT). Attempt at laparoscopic removal was unsuccessful, and mass was removed via a minilaparotomy in piecemeal fashion. Pathology showed ovarian NET arising from a teratoma. Four years later, patient presented with recurrence involving the pelvis and anterior abdominal wall. She was treated with debulking surgery and somatostatin analogs (SSAs). Targeted DNA sequencing analysis on the primary adnexal mass as well as the recurrent abdominal wall tumor confirmed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the MEN1 gene locus. This case represents to our knowledge, the first genetically confirmed case of ovarian NET arising by a MEN1 mechanism in a patient with MEN1. Extreme caution should be exercised during surgery as failure to remove an ovarian NET en masse can result in peritoneal seeding and recurrence. For patients with advanced ovarian NETs, systemic therapy options include SSAs, peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRRT) and novel agents targeting mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

However, numerous patients are resistant to currently available pharmacological and psychological interventions. Given that recent animal studies and magnetic resonance spectroscopy research points to glutamate dysfunction in OCD, we investigated the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in patients with OCD and healthy controls. We determined mGluR5 distribution volume ratio (DVR) in the brain of ten patients with OCD and ten healthy controls by using [11C]ABP688 positron-emission tomography. As a clinical measure of OCD severity, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) was employed. We found no significant global difference in mGluR5 DVR between patients with OCD and healthy controls. We did, however, observe significant positive correlations between the Y-BOCS obsession sub-score and mGluR5 DVR in the cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical brain circuit, including regions of the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex (Spearman's rho's >= = 0.68, p<0.05). These results suggest that obsessions in particular might have an underlying glutamatergic pathology related to mGluR5. The research indicates that the development of metabotropic glutamate agents would be useful as a new treatment for OCD.

BAY60-6583 Acts as a Partial Agonist at Adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> Receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; 2ND EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; JURKAT CELLS; CYCLIC-AMP; INTERNATIONAL UNION; HIGH-AFFINITY; BINDING; ANTAGONISTS; RADIOLIGAND; CLASSIFICATION	BAY60-6583 [2-({6-amino-3,5-dicyano-4-[4-(cyclopropylmethoxy) phenyl] pyridin-2-yl} sulfanyl) acetamide] is the most potent and selective adenosine A(2B) receptor (A(2B) AR) agonist known to date. Therefore, it has been widely used for in vitro and in vivo experiments. In the present study, we investigated the binding and functional properties of BAY60-6583 in various native and recombinant cell lines with different A(2B) AR expression levels. In cAMP accumulation and calcium mobilization assays, BAY60-6583 was found to be significantly less efficacious than adenosine or the adenosine derivative NECA. When it was tested in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, its efficacy correlated with the A(2B) expression level of the cells. In Jurkat T cells, BAY60-6583 antagonized the agonistic effect of NECA and adenosine as determined in cAMP accumulation assays. On the basis of these results, we conclude that BAY60-6583 acts as a partial agonist at adenosine A(2B) receptors. At high levels of the physiologic agonist adenosine, BAY60-6583 may act as an antagonist and block the effects of adenosine at A(2B) receptors. This has to be considered when applying the A(2B)-selective "agonist" BAY60-6583 in pharmacological studies, and previous research results may have to be reinterpreted.

Functional crosstalk and heteromerization of serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor; Dopamine D-2 receptor; Crosstalk; Schizophrenia; Hallucinogen; Antipsychotic	LIGAND-BINDING; HETERO-DIMERIZATION; UMAMI TASTE; 2A RECEPTOR; SCHIZOPHRENIA; CORTEX; GPCR; COOPERATIVITY; RELEVANCE; SYSTEM	The serotonin 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) and dopamine D-2 receptor (D2R) are high-affinity G protein-coupled receptor targets for two different classes of antipsychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia. Interestingly, the antipsychotic effects are not based on the regulation of same signaling mediators since activation of the 5-HT2AR and of the D2R regulate G(q/11) protein and G(i/o) protein, respectively. Here we use radioligand binding and second messenger production assays to provide evidence for a functional crosstalk between 5-HT2AR and D2R in brain and in HEK293 cells. D2R activation increases the hallucinogenic agonist affinity for 5-HT2AR and decreases the 5-HT2AR induced inositol phosphate production. In vivo, 5-HT2AR expression is necessary for the full effects of D2R antagonist on MK-801-induced locomotor activity. Co-immunoprecipitation studies show that the two receptors can physically interact in HEK293 cells and raise the possibility that a receptor heterocomplex mediates the crosstalk observed. The existence of this 5-HT2AR-D2R heteromer and crosstalk may have implications for diseases involving alterations of serotonin and dopamine systems and for the development of new classes of therapeutic drugs.

Antagonists show GTP-sensitive high-affinity binding to the sigma-1 receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Sigma-1 receptor; agonist; antagonist; calcium; MTS; cholera toxin; IPAG; rimcazole; G protein	FREE CALCIUM LEVELS; CANCER CELL-LINES; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; SURAMIN ANALOGS; STEROID-BINDING; TUMOR-GROWTH; GUINEA-PIG; G-PROTEINS; IN-VIVO; LIGANDS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Sigma-1 receptors are atypical receptors with potentially two transmembrane domains. Antagonists require doses significantly higher than their published affinities to have biological effects. We have reassessed the binding characteristics of these ligands and found antagonists bind to high-and low-affinity states not distinguished by agonists. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The affinities of sigma-1 receptor ligands was assessed using radioligand saturation and competition binding of [H-3]-(+)-pentazocine to permeabilized MDA-MB-468 cells. This was compared with the effect of ligands on metabolic activity using an MTS-based assay and calcium signalling using cells loaded with the calcium dye, Fura-2. KEY RESULTS Sigma-1 receptor antagonists, but not agonists, show GTP- and suramin-sensitive high-affinity binding. Functional responses (calcium signalling and metabolic activity), while associated with sigma-1 receptor binding, required binding to an unidentified, low-affinity target. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Sigma-1 receptors are coupled to G proteins. This interaction is only observed when analysing antagonist binding. The identity of the G protein remains to be resolved. The concept of agonist and antagonist at the sigma-1 receptor needs to be revisited.	[Brown, C. A.; Safrany, S.

We examined dopamine D1 receptor (D1DR) binding in the cerebral cortex and striatum of 12 adolescents (mean age 13.5 +/- 1.8 years) and 18 young adults (25 +/- 2.3 years) using positron emission tomography (PET) and radioligand [C-11]SCH23390. Over the age span of 10-30 years [C-11]SCH23390 binding (binding potential, BP) declined in all brain regions. The rate of BP decline was age-segment and brain region dependent. Most pronounced decline in BP was observed in the cortical regions during adolescence (mean BP in adults lower by 14-26% as compared to adolescents, P<0.0001). Significantly slower rate of decline in BP was observed in two cortical regions (orbitofrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) and striatal regions. The present PET-study provides new evidence on the development of D1DR in humans in vivo which is of critical importance for understanding of the biology of neurodevelopmental disorders.

Pharmacological profile of an essential oil derived from <i>Melissa officinalis</i> with anti-agitation properties:: focus on ligand-gated channels	JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; DOUBLE-BLIND; AROMATHERAPY; CALOPOROSIDE; MODULATION; MANAGEMENT; DEMENTIA; EFFICACY	A dual radioligand binding and electrophysiological study, focusing on a range of ligand-gated ion channels, was performed with a chemically-validated essential oil derived from Melissa officinalis (MO), which has shown clinical benefit in treating agitation. MO inhibited binding of [S-35] t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate (TBPS) to the rat forebrain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptor channel (apparent IC50 0.040 +/- 0.001 mg mL(-1)), but had no effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropianate (AMPA) or nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Electrophysiological analyses with primary cultures of rat cortical neurons demonstrated that MO reversibly inhibited GABA-induced currents in a concentration-dependent manner (0.01-1 mg mL(-1)), whereas no inhibition of NMDA- or AMPA-induced currents was noted. Interestingly, MO elicited a significant dose-dependent reduction in both inhibitory and excitatory transmission, with a net depressant effect on neurotransmission (in contrast to the classical GABA(A) antagonist picrotoxinin which evoked profound epileptiform burst firing in these cells). The anti-agitation effects in patients and the depressant effects of MO in in-vitro we report in neural membranes are unlikely to reflect a sedative interaction with any of the ionotropic receptors examined here.

However, the in vivo characterization of the pharmacodynamics of B1R antagonists is hindered by the low level of B1R expression in healthy tissue and the profound species selectivity exhibited by many compounds for the B1R. To circumvent these issues we generated two genetically engineered rodent models. The first is a transgenic rat over-expressing the human B1R under the control of the neuronal-specific enolase promoter; we previously reported the utility of this model in assessing human B1R receptor occupancy in the central nervous system of the rat. The second model, reported here, utilized gene-targeting by homologous recombination to replace the genomic coding sequence for the endogenous mouse B1R with that of the human B1R. The mRNA expression profile of the humanized Bdkrb1 (hBkdrb1) allele is similar to that of the mouse Bdkrb1 (mBkdrb1) in the wild-type animal. Furthermore, in vitro assays indicate that tissues isolated from the humanized mouse possess pharmacological properties characteristic of the human B1R. Therefore, we have generated a humanized B1R mouse model that is suitable for testing the efficacy of human B1R-selective compounds.

DESIGN We measured serum TgAb level and evaluated the disease status in 226 DTC patients who had undergone remnant ablation and showed an undetectable Tg result as assessed by immunoradiometric assay. MEASUREMENTS Radioligand assay of TgAb was performed. Recurrence was assessed by I-131 scan, F-8-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, sonography, computed tomography, or by surgical operation. RESULTS Fifty-one patients (22.6%) of the Tg-undetectable patients showed positive TgAb, and 25 (49.0%) of these were confirmed with recurrence. The recurrence rate of TgAb-positive patients was higher than that of TgAb-negative patients (3.4%; P < 0.0001). During follow-up, 73.1% of the disease-free patients showed spontaneously decreased TgAb levels. A total of 71.4% of patients with recurrent cancer, who showed responses to surgical operation or radio-iodine treatment, also showed a decreased TgAb level. CONCLUSIONS Persistently elevated TgAb levels appear to serve as a useful marker for recurrent or persistent DTC in patients with undetectable serum Tg results. Thus, the routine measurement of TgAb in such patient populations may be indicated.

This study aimed to determine dopamine transporter (DAT) availability, which is sensitive to dopamine levels, in the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system in MOH patients. Methods This case-control study investigated eligible MOH patients admitted to the International Headache Centre in the neurological department of Chinese PLA General Hospital between July 2018 and August 2019. All subjects underwent an integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance (MR) brain scans with (CFT)-C-11, a radioligand that binds to DAT. Standardised uptake value ratio (SUVr) images were compared voxelwise between MOH patients and healthy controls (HCs). SUVr values from significantly changed regions were extracted, and partial correlation analyses with clinical measures were conducted. Results We examined 17 MOH patients and 16 HCs. MOH patients had lower SUVr levels in the medial rather than lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) than HCs (T = -5.0317, P-GRF < 0.01), which showed no correlation with clinical features. Conclusions MOH is characterised by decreased DAT availability in the medial OFC, which might reflect compensatory downregulation due to low dopamine signalling within the mesocorticolimbic dopamine system and provide a new perspective to understand the pathogenesis of MOH.

Despite the observed advances in the development of new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), still about 30-40% of patients cannot achieve a satisfactory seizure control. In our current research, we aimed at using the combined results of radioligand binding experiments, PAMPA-BBB assay and animal experimentations in order to design a group of compounds that exhibit broad spectrum of anticonvulsant activity. The synthesized 4-alkyl-5-substituted-1,2,4-triazole-3-thione derivatives were primarily screened in the maximal electroshock-induced seizure (MES) test in mice. Next, the most promising compounds (17, 22) were investigated in 6 Hz (32 mA) psychomotor seizure model. Protective effect of compound 22 was almost similar to that of levetiracetam. Moreover, these compounds did not induce genotoxic and hemolytic changes in human cells as well as they were characterized by low cellular toxicity. Taking into account the structural requirements for good anticonvulsant activity of 4-alkyl-5-aryl-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones, it is visible that small electron-withdrawing substituents attached to phenyl ring have beneficial effects both on affinity towards VGSCs and protective activity in the animal models of epilepsy.

Since PSMA expression is not restricted to prostate cancer, the underlying study investigates PSMA expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Material and methods Immunohistochemistry was used to identify PSMA expression in n = 275 samples of NSCLC tissue specimens. By means of CD34 co-expression, the level of PSMA expression in tumor associated neovasculature was investigated. The impact of PSMA expression on clinicopathologic parameters and prognosis was evaluated. Results PSMA tumor cell expression in NSCLC is as low as 6% and was predominantly found in squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.002). Neovascular PSMA expression was found in 49% of NSCLC. High neovascular PSMA expression was associated with higher tumor grading (G3/G4) (p < 0.001). Neither for PSMA tumor cell expression, nor for PSMA neovascular cell expression prognostic effects were found for the investigated NSCLC cases. Conclusion Here, we report on the expression of PSMA in NSCLC tissue samples. Against the background of a potential treatment with radiolabeled PSMA ligands, our data might serve for the future identification of patients who could benefit from this therapeutic option.

Here, we addressed the role of brain regional mu-opioid receptor-mediated neurotransmission, one of the best recognized mechanisms of pain regulation, in chronic back pain in human subjects. We compared mu-opioid receptor availability in vivo at baseline, during pain expectation, and with moderate levels of sustained pain in 16 patients with chronic nonspecific back pain (CNBP) and in 16 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects, using the mu-opioid receptor-selective radioligand [C-11]carfentanil and positron emission tomography. We found that CNBP patients showed baseline increases in thalamic mu-opioid receptor availability, contrary to a previously studied sample of patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia. During both pain expectation and sustained pain challenges, CNBP patients showed regional reductions in the capacity to activate this neurotransmitter system compared with their control sample, further associated with clinical pain and affective state ratings. Our results demonstrate heterogeneity in endogenous opioid system functional measures across pain conditions, and alterations in both receptor availability and endogenous opioid function in CNBP that are relevant to the clinical presentation of these patients and the effects of opioid analgesics on mu-opioid receptors.

Thus, access to positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors could make important contributions to the understanding of psychotic disorders as well as to the pharmacokinetics and occupancy of drugs targeting the alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. However, so far no suitable PET radioligand has been developed for brain imaging of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Here, we report the synthesis of both enantiomers of the desmethyl precursors of the high affinity alpha(1)-adrenoceptor ligand Lu AE43936 (1). The two enantiomers of 1 were subsequently [C-11] radiolabelled and evaluated for brain uptake and binding by PET imaging in Danish Landrace pigs. (S)-[C-11]-1 and (R)-[C-11]-1 showed very limited brain uptake. Pre-treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) resulted in a large increase in brain uptake, indicating that (R)-(C-11]-1 is a substrate for active efflux-transporters. This was confirmed in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells overexpressing permeability glycoprotein (Pgp). In conclusion, the limited brain uptake of both (5)-[C-11]-1 and (R)-[C-11]-1 in the pig brain necessitates the search for alternative radioligands for in vivo PET brain imaging of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors.

The effects of agonists were tested in intact cells using DiBAC4(3) [bis-(1,3-dibarbituric acid)trimethine oxanol] as a membrane potential dye, and the results compared with their binding affinity for the SUR2B-type K-ATP channels using the radioligand [H-3]P1075. Compounds with cycloalkyl and (cycloalkyl)methyl side chains in position 3 had higher affinities towards the SUR2B/Kir6.1 receptor compared with the parent compound diazoxide (1 a). Compounds with bulky, nonpolar residues in position 3 exhibited remarkable selectivity for SUR2B-type K-ATP channels. The compound substituted with a bulky (1-adamantyl)methyl residue exhibited micromolar affinity and activity on SUR2B-type K-ATP channels without being able to activate the SUR1-type K-ATP channels.

Scintillation proximity assays for mechanistic and pharmacological analyses of HIV-1 integration	METHODS			English	Article						HIV-1; AIDS; Integrase; Integration; Integrase strand transfer inhibitor (InSTI); High-throughput; Scintillation proximity assay; Raltegravir	STRAND TRANSFER INHIBITORS; DNA INTEGRATION; BINDING; PROTEIN	The early events of HIV-1 replication are highlighted by reverse transcription and integration, and the reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes are important therapeutic targets. Integration proceeds through a series of steps including assembly of integrase oil the viral donor DNA ends, T-processing, and DNA strand transfer. First generation integrase assays typically included all biochemical reagents ill Solution where excess donor substrate could serve as the target for DNA strand transfer. These conditions, though valuable for understanding mechanistic aspects of HIV-1 integration, fell short of critical pharmacological designs as most early inhibitors were found to block assembly instead of enzyme function. Second generation designs, which decoupled assembly from DNA strand transfer, afforded the specificity required to identify clinically relevant Compounds. Here, we describe versatile scintillation proximity-based assays whereby integrase is assembled onto donor DNA that is immobilized onto the surface of beads. Immobilization and subsequent washing of excess donor DNA eliminates its potential to serve as target DNA, allowing investigation of the DNA strand transfer reaction ill isolation. Assembled complexes can be used in high-through put DNA strand transfer assays if radio labeled target DNA is employed, or in integrase binding assays using a suitable radioligand.

FPyKYNE (non-labelled as reference), as well as the 2-bromo, 2-nitro and 2-trimethylammonium analogues (as precursors for labelling with fluorine-18), was synthesized in 44, 95, 60 and 41%, respectively, from commercially available 5-chloropent-1-yne and the appropriate 2-substituted-3-hydroxypyridines. [F-18]FPyKYNE was synthesized in one single radiochemical step by reaction of no-carrier-added K[F-18]F-Kryptofix (R) 222 (DMSO, 165 degrees C, 3-5 min) followed by C-18 SepPak cartridge pre-purification and finally semi-preparative HPLC purification on a Hewlett Packard SiO2 Zorbax (R) Rx-SIL. Using the 2-nitropyridine or the pyridin-2-yltrimethylammonium trifluoromethanesulphonate precursor for labelling (30 and 10 mu mol, respectively), incorporation yields up to 90% were observed and 7.0-8.9 GBq (190-240 mCi) of [F-18]FPyKYNE ([F-18]-1) could be isolated within 60-70 min (HPLC purification included), starting from a 37.0 GBq (1.0 Ci) [F-18]fluoride batch (overall decay-corrected and isolated yields: 30-35%).

The resulting HEK293 alpha (1A) adrenoceptor cell-membrane stationary phase can be used for rapid on-line chromatographic determination of potential subtype-selective alpha (1) -adrenoceptor ligand-binding affinities for alpha (1) -adrenoceptor subtypes. The objective of the research was to study whether cell lines stably overexpressing subtype receptors could improve the sensitivity and specificity of cell-membrane chromatography (CMC) compared with use of homogenized tissue and cells in primary culture. Effects of mobile-phase ionic strength, sample concentration, and the presence of competitive agents on ligand-receptor interaction in CMSP were also evaluated. We found that cell lines stably overexpressing subtype receptors led to improved sensitivity and specificity in CMC. The technique leads to useful procedures-cell-membrane stationary phases may, for example, facilitate exploration of ligand-receptor interaction and determination of ligand-receptor binding affinity in initial screening and separation of lead compounds or active components in Chinese traditional natural medicine and herbs. This might eventually be an important contribution and an addition to our collection of techniques.

It is not known whether depression in post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients is also serotonin-mediated. In somatically healthy depressed persons, increased brain 5-HT2A receptor binding has been reported in some studies. In animal studies, decreased serotonin activity was found after induction of MI. In the present study, it was hypothesized that depressed post-MI patients would exhibit increased brain 5-HT2A receptor binding compared with non-depressed post-MI patients. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the radioligand I-123-5-I-R91150, a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist, was used to study 5-HT2A receptor binding. SPECT scans were performed in nine depressed post-MI patients, 10 non-depressed post-MI patients and 10 healthy control subjects. Results were analysed using statistical parametric mapping. Depressed post-MI patients showed increased 5-HT2A receptor binding compared with non-depressed post-MI patients, and MI patients showed decreased 5-HT2A receptor binding compared with control persons. Both post-MI depression and MI seem to be associated with changes in 5-HT2A receptor binding. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

No in vivo study has been reported to measure postsynaptic GABA receptors in the patients. Methods: Cortical benzodiazepine (BZ) binding to GABA(A) receptors was measured with [I-123]iomazenil and single photon emission computed tomography in unmedicated patients with unipolar major depression (n = 13) and healthy subjects (n = 19). Group differences were evaluated by means of statistical parametric mapping (SPM) with partial volume correction for gray matter. Occipital GABA levels were determined by proton MRS in a subgroup (n = 6) of the patients. Results: No evidence of altered BZ binding was found in patients with depression compared with healthy control subjects in the SPM analysis. Although reduction in gray matter volume was observed in the frontal cortex and amygdala of the patients, partial volume correction of the atrophy did not change the result of unaltered BZ binding. GABA levels were found lower in the occipital cortex; however, BZ binding did not show significant relationship to GABA levels. Conclusions: GABA(A) receptor binding measured in vivo with BZ radioligand binding are not altered in patients with depression. (C) 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

In this study, the agonist/antagonist activity of iloperidone was determined in cell lines expressing recombinant human D-2A, D-3, alpha(2C), 5-HT1A, or 5-HT6 receptors. With the exception of 5-HT6 receptors, these receptors are negatively coupled to cyclase. Thus, after stimulation with forskolin, the agonists doparnine (at D-2A and D-3) noradrenaline (at alpha(2C)), or 8-OH-DPAT (at 5-HT) A) induced a reduction in cAMP accumulation. Conversely, activation of the 5-HT6 receptor by 5-HT led to an increase in cAMP accumulation. lloperidone alone was devoid of significant agonist activity but inhibited the agonist response in all 5 cell lines in a surmountable and concentration-dependent fashion. lloperidone was most potent at D3 receptors (pK(B) 8.59 +/- 0.20; n = 6), followed by alpha(2C) (pK(B) 7.83 +/- 0.06; n=15), 5-HT1A(pK(B) 7.69 +/- 0.18; n=10), D-2A (pK(B) 7.53 +/- 0.04; n = 11) and 5-HT6 (pK(B) 7.11 +/- 0.08; n = 11) receptors.

The tetrapeptide analogs were prepared using standard Fmoc-solid phase peptide synthesis in conjunction with incorporation of Fmoc-Phe(p-NHAparallel tooc) and modification of the p-amino group. The electrophilic groups isothiocyanate and bromoacetamide were introduced into the para position on either Phe(3) or Phe(4); the corresponding free amine-containing peptides were also prepared for comparison. The peptides bearing an affinity label group and their free amine analogs were evaluated in a radioligand-binding assay using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing mu- and delta-opioid receptors. Modification on Phe4 was better tolerated than on Phe3 for L-receptor binding. Among the analogs tested, [Phe(P-NH2)(4)]endomorphin-2 showed the highest affinity (IC50 = 37 nm) for mu-receptors. The Phe(p-NHCOCH2Br)(4) analog displayed the highest mu-receptor affinity (IC50 = 158 nm) among the peptides containing an affinity label group. Most of the compounds exhibited negligible binding affinity for delta-receptors, similar to the parent peptide.

However, RAMPs are more widely distributed across cell and tissue types than the CTR and CL receptor, suggesting additional roles for RAMPs in cellular processes. We have investigated the potential for RAMP interaction with a number of Class H G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in addition to the CL receptor and the CTR. Using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, we demonstrate, for the first time, that RAMPs interact with at least four additional receptors, the VPAC1 vasoactive intestinal polypeptide/pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide receptor with all three RAMPs; the glucagon and PTH1 parathyroid hormone receptors with RAMP2; and the PTH2 receptor with RAMP3. Unlike the interaction of RAMPs with the CL receptor or the CTR, VPAC1R-RAMP complexes do not show altered phenotypic behavior compared with the VPAC1R alone, as determined using radioligand binding in COS-7 cells. However, the VPAC1R-RAMP2 heterodimer displays a significant enhancement of agonist-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis with no change in cAMP stimulation compared with the VPAC1R alone. Our findings identify a new functional consequence of RAMP-receptor interaction, suggesting that RAMPs play a more general role in modulating cell signaling through other GPCRs than is currently appreciated.

In non-human primates, central serotonin transporter availability and turnover rate were associated with aggressive behavior and a low response to initial alcohol exposure. We assessed the respective effects of these factors on alcohol intake in a free choice paradigm. Serotonin transporter availability in the raphe area, the origin of central serotonergic projections, was measured with single-photon emission computed tomography and the radioligand [I-123]beta-CIT in 11 rhesus monkeys with low and high central serotonin turnover. The amount of alcohol intake in the 3-month observation period was positively correlated with serotonin transporter availability (R=0.76, P=0.006), but not with aggressiveness (R=0.19, P=0.6) or alcohol response upon first exposure (R=-0.48, P=0.2). In a linear multiple regression analysis with serotonin transporter availability, alcohol response, and aggressiveness as independent variables, 82% of the variance of alcohol intake was explained and serotonin transporter availability emerged as the only statistically significant factor (beta=7.81, P=0.006). These observations indicate that there may be a direct relationship between serotonin transporter availability and alcohol intake after controlling for aggression and alcohol response on first exposure.

Structural similarities between acetylcholine and lithocholyltaurine suggest a potential molecular basis for their interaction with the same receptor. We synthesized a hybrid molecule consisting of the steroid nucleus of lithocholyltaurine and the choline moiety of acetylcholine. The new molecule, lithocholylcholine, is hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase. Lithocholylcholine inhibited binding of a cholinergic radioligand to Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing each of the five muscarinic receptor subtypes. The binding affinities (K-i; micromolar) of lithocholylcholine for these receptors were: M3 (1.0) > M1 (2.7) > M2 (4.1) = M4 (4.9) > M5 (6.2). Lithocholylcholine inhibited intracellular signaling pathways mediated by interaction with M1, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptors. Regarding M3 receptors, lithocholylcholine was 10-fold more potent than lithocholyltaurine in terms of binding affinity and inhibition of acetylcholine-induced increases in inositol phosphate formation and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation. In a functional assay, lithocholylcholine inhibited acetylcholine-induced relaxation of rat aortic rings. These observations indicate that lithocholylcholine is a muscarinic receptor antagonist and provide further evidence that bile acids may have gastrointestinal signaling functions that extend beyond their effects on sterol metabolism, lipid absorption, and cholesterol elimination. Hybrid molecules created from bile acids and acetylcholine may be used to develop selective muscarinic receptor ligands.

Affinity constants were measured on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the human A(3) receptors by inhibition assays of the binding of the selective A(3) antagonist [H-3]MRE 30081720. van't Hoff plots were linear for agonists and antagonists in the temperature range 4-30degrees. Their thermodynamic parameters fall in the ranges 21 less than or equal to DeltaHdegrees less than or equal to 67 kJ mol(-1) and 208 less than or equal to DeltaSdegrees < 410 J (K mol)(-1) for agonists and -52 ≤ ΔH° ≤ -9 kJ mol(-1) and 16 ≤ ΔS° ≤ 81 J (K/mol)(-1) for antagonists, showing that agonist binding is always totally entropy-driven while antagonist binding is enthalpy- and entropy-driven.

J	Hall, DA				Hall, DA			Modeling the functional effects of allosteric modulators at pharmacological receptors: An extension of the two-state model of receptor activation	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; OCCUPANCY MODEL; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; AMILORIDE ANALOGS; ACETYLCHOLINE; ADENOSINE; ENHANCER; PD-81,723; AGONISM; LIGANDS	Allosteric modulation is a mechanism for modifying pharmacological receptor activity that has largely been ignored in terms of therapeutic drug design, although benzodiazepine receptor ligands are an example of the serendipitous discovery of this class of compound. The current mathematical models of allosteric interactions at (particularly G-protein-coupled) receptors concentrate on the effects of the allosteric ligand on orthosteric ligand binding and ignore potential effects of these compounds on the ability of orthosteric ligands to cause receptor activation. In this report a mathematical model of allosteric interactions at pharmacological receptors has been investigated that explicitly includes effects of the allosteric ligand on receptor activation. This model uses the two-state model of receptor activation as its basis and is qualitatively consistent with currently reported behavior of allosteric modulators. The predictions of this model suggest a series of criteria that should be tested before the effects of an allosteric modulator can be quantified in a nonsystem-dependent manner. It has also been used to provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the functional effects of the A(1) adenosine receptor allosteric enhancer PD 81,723 and a recently reported allosteric modulator of type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors.

Amyloid biomarkers are not suitable for that purpose. The alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs) are widely abundant in the human brain. As neuromodulators they play an important role in cognitive functions such as attention, learning and memory. Post-mortem studies reported lower expression of alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs in more advanced Alzheimer's dementia. However, there is ongoing controversy whether alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs are reduced in early Alzheimer's dementia. Therefore, using the recently developed alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR-specific radioligand (-)-F-18-flubatine and PET, we aimed to quantify the alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR availability and its relationship to specific cognitive dysfunction in mild Alzheimer's dementia. Fourteen non-smoking patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia, drug-naive for cholinesterase therapy, were compared with 15 non-smoking healthy controls matched for age, sex and education by applying (-)-F-18-flubatine PET together with a neuropsychological test battery. The one-tissue compartment model and Logan plot method with arterial input function were used for kinetic analysis to obtain the total distribution volume (V-T) as the primary, and the specific binding part of the distribution volume (V-S) as the secondary quantitative outcome measure of alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR availability. V-S was determined by using a pseudo-reference region. Correlations between V-T within relevant brain regions and Z-scores of five cognitive functions (episodic memory, executive function/working memory, attention, language, visuospatial function) were calculated. V-T (and V-S) were applied for between-group comparisons. Volume of interest and statistical parametric mapping analyses were carried out. Analyses revealed that in patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia compared to healthy controls, there was significantly lower V-T, especially within the hippocampus, fronto-temporal cortices, and basal forebrain, which was similar to comparisons of V-S. V-T decline in Alzheimer's dementia was associated with distinct domains of impaired cognitive functioning, especially episodic memory and executive function/working memory. Using (-)-F-18-flubatine PET in patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia, we show for the first time a cholinergic alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR deficiency mainly present within the basal forebrain-cortical and septohippocampal cholinergic projections and a relationship between lower alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR availability and impairment of distinct cognitive domains, notably episodic memory and executive function/working memory. This shows the potential of (-)-(18) F-flubatine as PET biomarker of cholinergic alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR dysfunction and specific cognitive decline. Thus, if validated by longitudinal PET studies, (-)-F-18-flubatine might become a PET biomarker of progression of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's dementia.

However, there is a lack of suitable F-18-labelled PET radioligands for that purpose. The selective sigma(1) receptor ligand [F-18]fluspidine (1'-benzyl-3-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]) was synthesized by nucleophilic F-18(-) substitution of the tosyl precursor. In vitro receptor binding affinity and selectivity were assessed by radioligand competition in tissue homogenate and autoradiographic approaches. In female CD-1 mice, in vivo properties of [F-18]fluspidine were evaluated by ex vivo brain section imaging and organ distribution of intravenously administered radiotracer. Target specificity was validated by organ distribution of [F-18]fluspidine after treatment with 1 mg/kg i.p. of the sigma receptor antagonist haloperidol or the emopamil binding protein (EBP) inhibitor tamoxifen. In vitro metabolic stability and in vivo metabolism were investigated by LC-MSn and radio-HPLC analysis. [F-18]Fluspidine was obtained with a radiochemical yield of 35-45%, a radiochemical purity of a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 99.6% and a specific activity of 150-350 GBq/mu mol (n = 6) within a total synthesis time of 90-120 min. In vitro, fluspidine bound specifically and with high affinity to sigma(1) receptors (K (i) = 0.59 nM). In mice, [F-18]fluspidine rapidly accumulated in brain with uptake values of 3.9 and 4.7%ID/g and brain to blood ratios of 7 and 13 at 5 and 30 min after intravenous application of the radiotracer, respectively. By ex vivo autoradiography of brain slices, resemblance between binding site occupancy of [F-18]fluspidine and the expression of sigma(1) receptors was shown. The radiotracer uptake in the brain as well as in peripheral sigma(1) receptor expressing organs was significantly inhibited by haloperidol but not by tamoxifen. Incubation with rat liver microsomes led to a fast biotransformation of fluspidine. After an incubation period of 30 min only 13% of the parent compound was left. Seven metabolites were identified by HPLC-UV and LC-MSn techniques. However, [F-18]fluspidine showed a higher metabolic stability in vivo. In plasma samples similar to aEuro parts per thousand 94% of parent compound remained at 30 min and similar to aEuro parts per thousand 67% at 60 min post-injection. Only one major radiometabolite was detected. None of the radiometabolites crossed the blood-brain barrier. [F-18]Fluspidine demonstrated favourable target affinity and specificity as well as metabolic stability both in vitro and in animal experiments. The in vivo properties of [F-18]fluspidine offer a high potential of this radiotracer for neuroimaging and quantitation of sigma(1) receptors in vivo.

Whereas the two MCH receptor subtypes hitherto cloned, MCH-R-1 and MCH-R-2, are thought to mediate mainly the central effects of MCH, the MCH-R on pigment cells has not yet been identified, although in some studies MCH-R-1 was reported to be expressed by human melanocytes and melanoma cells. Here we present data of a structure-activity study in which 12 MCH peptides were tested on rat MCH-R-1 and mouse B16 melanoma cell MCH-R, by comparing receptor binding affinities and biological activities. For receptor binding analysis with HEK-293 cells expressing rat MCH-R-1 (SLC-1), the radioligand was [I-125]-[Tyr(13)]-MCH with the natural sequence. For B16 cells (F1 and G4F sublines) expressing B16 MCH-R, the analog [I-125]-[D-Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH served as radioligand. The bioassay used for MCH-R-1 was intracellular Ca2+ mobilization quantified with the FLIPR instrument, whereas for B16 MCH-R the signal determined was MAP kinase activation. Our data show that some of the peptides displayed a similar relative increase or decrase of potency in both cell types tested. For example, linear MCH with Ser residues at positions 7 and 16 was almost inactive whereas a slight increase in side-chain hydrophilicity at residues 4 and 8, or truncation of MCH at the N-terminus by two residues hardly changed binding affinity or bioactivity. On the other hand, salmonic MCH which also lacks the first two residues of the mammalian sequence but in addition has different residues at positions 4, 5, 9, and 18 exhibited a 5- to 10-fold lower binding activity than MCH in both cell systems. A striking difference in ligand recognition between MCH-R-1 and B16 MCH-R was however observed with modifications at position 13 of MCH: whereas L-Phe(13) in [Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH was well tolerated by both MCH-R, and B16 MCH-R, change of configuration to D-Phe(13) in [D-Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH or [D-Phe(13)]-MCH led to a complete loss of biological activity and to a 5- to 10-fold lower binding activity with MCH-RI. By contrast, the D-Phe(13) residue increased the affinity of [D-Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH to B16 MCH-R about 10-fold and elicited MAP kinase activation as observed with [Phe', Tyr(19)]-MCH or MCH. These data demonstrate that ligand recognition by B16 MCH-R differs from that of MCH-R, in several respects, indicating that the B16 MCH-R represents an MCH-R subtype different from MCH-R-1.

This limited use is partially justified by several concomitant factors that make calculations a complex process. Therefore, simplified dosimetry protocols are required. Methods In our study, dosimetric evaluations were performed in thirty patients with NENs who underwent RLT with [Lu-177]Lu-DOTATATE. The reference method (M0) calculated the cumulative absorbed dose performing dosimetry after each of the four cycles. Obtained data were employed to assess the feasibility of simplified protocols: defining the dosimetry only after the first cycle (M1) and after the first and last one (M2). Results The mean differences of the cumulative absorbed doses between M1 and M0 were - 10% for kidney, - 5% for spleen, + 34% for liver, + 13% for red marrow, and + 37% for tumor lesions. Conversely, differences lower than +/- 10% were measured between M2 and M0. Conclusion Cumulative absorbed doses obtained with the M2 protocol resembled the doses calculated by M0, while the M1 protocol overestimated the absorbed doses in all organs at risk, except for the spleen.

Within this work, we have identified a series of twelve 4,4'-difluorobenzhydrol carbamates through a rigorous docking campaign leveraging commercially available amine databases. After synthesis, these compounds have been evaluated for their physico-chemical property profiles, including characteristics such as HPLC-logD, tPSA, logBB, and logPS. For all the synthesized carbamates, these characteristics indicate the potential for BBB permeation. In competitive radioligand binding experiments using Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes expressing the individual human mAChR subtype hM(1)-hM 5 , the most promising compound 2 displayed a high binding affinitiy towards hM(1)R (1.2 nM) while exhibiting modest-to-excellent selectivity versus the hM(2-5)R (4-189-fold). All 12 compounds were shown to act in an antagonistic fashion towards hM(1)R using a dose-dependent calcium mobilization assay. The structural eligibility for radiolabeling and their pharmacological and physico-chemical property profiles render compounds 2, 5, and 7 promising candidates for future position emission tomography (PET) tracer development.

The study assessed the impact of Santa herba on oxidative stress, energy metabolism, weight reduction, and eating behavior, combining in vitro models with clinical data. Santa herba binding of the adenosine receptor A2A (ADORA2A) was assessed using a radioligand binding assay. A Caenorhabditis elegans model was used to determine mobility boosting effects, and Santa herba oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) values were determined in comparison to antioxidative plants. Clinical data, that is, body weight and appetite-related parameters, were obtained from overweight and obese women receiving either Santa herba or placebo for 12 weeks. Results showed that Santa herba extract binds to ADORA2A, stimulates C. elegans motility (+7.5%) and locomotion, and yields high antioxidative capacities (ORAC: 819 trolox equivalent). Clinical data, obtained from 24 overweight and 25 obese women (mean: 47.5 years), demonstrated a reduced body weight (P = .042) and body fat (P = .044), and by trend reduced leptin levels (P = .065) in women with obesity after Santa herba consumption compared to placebo. In conclusion, Santa herba extract has energizing and antioxidative properties and may aid in weight management of people with obesity. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03853603.

Test-retest variability and reference region-based quantification of <SUP>18</SUP>F-BCPP-EF for imaging mitochondrial complex I in the human brain	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Brain imaging; positron emission tomography; MC-I; kinetic modelling; neurodegeneration	PET; VIVO	Mitochondrial complex I (MC-I) is an essential regulator of brain bioenergetics and can be quantified in the brain using PET radioligand F-18-BCPP-EF. Here we evaluate the test-retest reproducibility of F-18-BCPP-EF in humans, and assess the use of a non-invasive quantification method (standardised uptake value ratio - SUVR). Thirty healthy volunteers had a 90-min dynamic F-18-BCPP-EF scan with arterial blood sampling, five of which received a second scan to be included in the test-retest analysis. Time-activity curves (TAC) were analysed using multilinear analysis 1 (MA1) and the two-tissue compartment model (2TC) to estimate volumes of distribution (V-T). Regional SUVR-1 values were calculated from the 70 to 90-min TAC data using the centrum semiovale as a pseudo reference region, and compared to kinetic analysis-derived outcome measures. The mean absolute test-retest variability of V-T ranged from 12% to 18% across regions. Both DVR-1and SUVR-1 had improved test-retest variability in the range 2%-7%. SUVR-1 was highly correlated with DVR-1 (r(2) = 0.97, n = 30). In conclusion, F-18-BCPP-EF has suitable test-retest reproducibility and can be used to quantify MC-I in clinical studies.

An increased A(2A)R availability has been found in the human striatum at early stages of PD and in patients with PD and dyskinesias. The aim of this small animal positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance (PET/MR) imaging study was to investigate whether rotenone-treated mice reflect the aspect of striatal A(2A)R upregulation in PD. For that purpose, we selected the known A(2A)R-specific radiotracer [F-18]FESCH and developed a simplified two-step one-pot radiosynthesis. PET images showed a high uptake of [F-18]FESCH in the mouse striatum. Concomitantly, metabolism studies with [F-18]FESCH revealed the presence of a brain-penetrant radiometabolite. In rotenone-treated mice, a slightly higher striatal A(2A)R binding of [F-18]FESCH was found. Nonetheless, the correlation between the increased A(2A)R levels within the proposed PD animal model remains to be further investigated.

This review focuses on G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), examining techniques that can be applied to both receptors in membranes and after solubilisation. Radioligand binding remains a widely used technique, although there is increasing use of fluorescent ligands. These can be used in a variety of experimental designs, either directly monitoring ligand itself with techniques such as fluorescence polarisation or indirectly via resonance energy transfer (fluorescence/Forster resonance energy transfer, FRET and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, BRET). Label free techniques such as isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) are also increasingly being used. For GPCRs, the main measure of receptor activation is to investigate the association of the G protein with the receptor. The chief assay measures the receptor-stimulated binding of GTP or a suitable analogue to the receptor. The direct association of the G protein with the receptor has been investigated via resonance energy techniques. These have also been used to measure ligand-induced conformational changes within the receptor; a variety of experimental techniques are available to incorporate suitable donors and acceptors within the receptor.

Design, synthesis and preliminary evaluation of a novel SPECT DTPA-bis-triazaspirodecanone conjugate for D<sub>2</sub> receptor imaging	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							DOPAMINE-RECEPTORS; BINDING-AFFINITY; HUMAN-BRAIN; D2-DOPAMINE RECEPTORS; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; OCCUPANCY; COMPETITION; RELAXIVITY; LIGANDS	On the basis of pharmacological behaviour, dopamine receptors are divided into D-1 and D-2 subtype, which are primarily responsible for several neurophysiological anomalies. Assessment and validation with SPECT based conjugates provides a promising and cost effective insight to detect molecular changes in such neurological diseases. Spiperone, a well known "butryophenone" based D-2 receptor antagonist, has been explored to design a novel conjugate for SPECT evaluation. The molecular docking pose analysis of the designed molecule was explored with dopamine D-2 receptor. The molecule showed high affinity (-51.318 kcal mol(-1)) due to conserved interactions with Asp114 and Phe389 of D-2 receptor. DTPA with triazaspirodecanone moiety of spiperone was synthesized using bifunctional chelation approach with 88% yield and has been characterized using NMR and mass spectroscopy. The radiolabeling efficiency of Tc-99m-DTPA-bis-(1-phenyl-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4,5]decan-4-one) was 98%. The complex showed appreciable brain uptake in mice. Receptor binding experiments revealed a K-d of 6.26 nM with maximum localization of the conjugate in the striatum. Thus, these studies could be viewed as novel and informative, initial proof-of-concept approach to the field of Tc-99m-labeled radioligand design.

Radiosynthesis of a novel potential adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor ligand, 5-ethyl 2,4-diethyl-3-((2-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluoroethyl)sulfanylcarbonyl)-6-phenylpyridine-5-carboxylate ([<SUP>18</SUP>F]FE@SUPPY:2)	RADIOCHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						Adenosine; PET; Receptor; Fluorine-18; Radioligand	PRODRUGS	Since, to date very limited information on the distribution and function of the adenosine A(3) receptor is available, the development of suitable radioligands is needed. Recently, we introduced [F-18]FE@SUPPY (5-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl) 2,4-diethyl-3-(ethylsulfanylcarbonyl)-6phenylpyridine-5-carboxylate) as the first PET-ligand for the A3R. Regarding the metabolic profile - this class of dialkylpyridines comprises two ester functions within one molecule, one carboxylic and one thiocarboxylic - one Could expect carboxylesterases significantly contributing to cleavage and degradation. Therefore, our aim was the development of [F-18]FE@SUPPY:2 (5-ethyl 2,4-diethyl-3-((2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)sulfanylcarbonyl)-6-phenylpyridine-5-carboxylate), the functional isomer containing the label at the thiocarboxylic moiety. For satisfactory yields in high scale radiosyntheses, a reaction temperature of 75 degrees C has to be applied for at least 20 min using 20 mg/mL of precursor. So far, 6 complete high-scale radiosyntheses were performed. Starting from an average of 51.2 +/- 21.8 GBq (mean +/- SD) [F-18]fluoride, 5.8 +/- 4.1 GBq of formulated [F-18]FE@SUPPY:2 (12.0 +/- 5.4%, based on [F-18]fluoride, not corrected for decay) were prepared in 75 +/- 8 min.

The results of binding studies confirm the notion that the benzoxazolone moiety confers preference towards sigma(1) sites and establish that the ability to bind to sigma(1), but not to sigma(2) receptors, is strongly affected by the kind and the position of the substituents introduced in the N-benzyl ring. In fact, compounds with substitutions in para-position with atoms of Cl, H or F or with a CH3 group exhibit a higher affinity for sigma(1) receptors than the corresponding ortho-substituted compounds. The highest affinity and selectivity, with K-i values of 0.1 and 427 nM for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors, respectively, and a corresponding K-i sigma(2)/K-i sigma(1) selectivity ratio of 4270 were found for the Cl-substituted compound. These results indicate that benzo[d]oxazol-2(3H)-one derivatives are among the most selective and sigma(1) receptor-preferring ligands currently available. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Muscarinic preferential M<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonists enhance the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine in rats	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						cocaine; drug-discrimination behavior; muscarinic antagonist; M1, benztropine analogues; dopamine transporter; rats	DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; ANALOGS; AMPHETAMINE; BENZTROPINE; RADIOLIGAND	Previous studies of benztropine analogues have found them to inhibit dopamine uptake like cocaine, but with less effectiveness than cocaine in producing behavioral effects related to drug abuse. Studies have assessed whether nonselective muscarinic antagonists decrease the effects of cocaine because many of the benztropine analogues are also muscarinic antagonists. As previous studies were conducted with nonselective muscarinic antagonists and the benztropine analogues show preferential affinity for the M, muscarinic receptor subtype, the present study examined interactions of cocaine and the preferential M, antagonists, telenzepine (TZP) and trihexyphenidyl (TXP) on subjective effects in rats trained to discriminate cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) from saline injections. Cocaine dose-dependently increased the percentage of responses on the cocaine-appropriate lever, with full substitution at the training dose. In contrast neither UP nor TXP produced more than 25% cocaine-appropriate responding at any dose. Both M, antagonists produced significant leftward shifts in the cocaine dose-effect curve, TZP at 3.0 and TXP at 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg. The present results indicate that preferential antagonist actions at muscarinic M, receptors enhance rather than attenuate the discriminative-stimulus effects of cocaine, and thus those actions unlikely contribute to the reduced cocaine-like effects of BZT analogues.

The compound possesses appropriate lipophilicity (log P = 2.2) and binds sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors (pKi = 6.51 and 6.79, respectively). In mice, this new radioiodinated tracer exhibited high brain uptake (4.99% ID/g tissue at 10 min postinjection) and saturable binding (3.06% ID/g tissue at 10 min postinjection) as determined by pretreatment with unlabeled [I-123]-BPB. A metabolite study demonstrated no (less than 5%) labeled metabolites in the brain. In rabbits, regional brain distribution was investigated and the tracer displayed high, homogeneous central nervous system uptake. Selectivity was assessed by competition experiments with known sigma ligands. Metabolite analysis showed no (less than 8%) labeled metabolites in the rabbit brain. In conclusion, our findings indicate that [I-123]-BPB is not a suitable tracer for visualisation of D-3 receptors while its potential for sigma receptor imaging is severely hampered by its affinity for dopamine receptors.

Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with lipopolysaccharide (10 mg/kg) i.v. to induce endotoxaemia and systolic blood pressure was measured each hour. The animals were sacrificed after 6, 12 or 24 hours and organs were removed. Gene expression of vasoconstrictive receptors such as angiotensin II type 1-(AT(1))-receptors, vasopressin V-1A-receptors and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors were determined with specific RNase-protection-assay. Tissue-concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and of catecholamines were measured using ELISA or HPLC, respectively. Plasma-renin-activity, plasma-angiotensin II- und plasma-aldosteron-concentrations were determined with RIA. In addition, blood-pressure-dose-response studies with angiotensin II and a selective V-1-receptor-agonist were carried out after induction of experimental endotoxaemia compared to vehicle-injected rats. Rat renal mesangial cells and aortal vascular smooth muscle cells (cell line A7r5) were incubated with proinflammatory cytokines and NO-donators and gene and protein expression of vasoconstrictive receptors were determined using RNase-protection-assay and radioligand-binding studies, respectively.

This paper first describes a general production optimization strategy, and then elaborates on a protein design strategy tailored to targeting applications. Production in Escherichia coli will benefit from economy of goods and time as compared to other organisms. In order to increase the chance of finding a successful production system in this host, we have assembled a large number of expression strategies in a single, uniform expression system (FastScreen). The system allows rapid optimization of direct production of native proteins or via a fusion protein strategy with subsequent recovery of the desired protein. As an example of recombinant radioligand synthesis for improved targeting and clearing, a manifold of intermediate molecular size was synthesized by fusing one Fab and two single-chain variable fragments (scFv) antibody binding fragments into a trifunctional molecule (Tribody). Due to the use of the specific heterodimerization of the Fab chains, trispecific, bispecific, or trivalent antibody derived targeting reagents can easily be obtained. Recombinant production techniques also allow for specific incorporation of amino acids favoring a site specific labeling (labeling tags).

The affinity of AH-9700 for sigma (1) receptors was significantly reduced in the presence of 5'-guanylyl-imidodiphosphate (GppNHp). In isolated bladder strip s of rats, AH-9700 inhibited carbachol-induced contractions. In anesthetized rats, i.v. administration of AH-9700 and typical sigma receptor ligands, (+)-pentazocine and 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG), but not oxybutynin, dose-dependently inhibited rhythmic isovolumetric reflex bladder contractions. AH-9700 and oxybutynin suppressed the amplitude of rhythmic bladder contractions. On the other hand, at doses lower than used i.v., the i.c.v. administration of AH-9700 or the sigma receptor ligands inhibited rhythmic bladder contractions without suppressing the amplitude. This inhibitory effect of AH-9700 was markedly reduced by pretreatment with i.c.v. pertussis toxin. These results suggest that AH-9700 exerts a marked anti-micturition reflex effect through central sigma receptors possibly related to pertussis toxin-sensitive Gi/o-proteins and a moderate spasmolytic effect based on its peripheral anti-muscarinic activity.

Evidence for allosteric regulation of ligand binding	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS; PROGESTERONE-RECEPTOR COMPLEXES; ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM; ATP-BINDING; MOLECULAR CHAPERONE; PEPTIDE-BINDING; STRESS PROTEINS; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-CHAINS; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; T-CELLS	X-ray crystallographic studies of the N-terminal domain of Hsp90 have identified an unconventional ATP binding fold, thereby inferring a role for ATP in the regulation of the Hsp90 activity. In this report, N-ethyl-carboxamidoadenosine (NECA) was used to investigate the nucleotide binding properties of GRP94, the endoplasmic reticulum paralog of Hsp90. Whereas Hsp90 did not bind NECA, GRP94 bound NECA in a saturable manner with a K-d of 200 nM. NECA binding to GRP94 was efficiently blocked by geldanamycin and radicicol. Analysis of ligand binding stoichiometries by radioligand and calorimetric techniques indicated that GRP94 bound 1 mol of NECA/mol of GRP94 dimer. In contrast, GRP94 bound radicicol at a stoichiometry of 2 mol of radicicol/mol of GRP94 dimer. In [H-3]NECA displacement assays, GRP94 displayed binding interactions with ATP, dATP, ADP, AMP, cAMP, and adenosine, but not GTP, CTP, or UTP. To accommodate the 0.5 mol of NE-CA:mol of GRP94 binding stoichiometry observed for the native GRP94 dimer, a model for allosteric regulation (negative cooperativity) of ligand binding is proposed. A hypothesis on the regulation of GRP94 conformation and activity by adenosine-based ligand(s) other than ATP and ADP is presented.

Structure-Activity Studies of 1H-Imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amine Derivatives as A3 Adenosine Receptor Positive Allosteric Modulators	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							SIGMATROPIC 1,2-ACYL SHIFT; INTERNATIONAL UNION; AGONIST EFFICACY; BINDING; SERIES; GPCRS; NOMENCLATURE; MECHANISM; ENHANCERS; EFFICIENT	We previously reported 1H-imidazo[4,5-c]quinolin-4-amines as A3 adenosine receptor (A3AR) positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). A3AR agonists, but not PAMs, are in clinical trials for inflammatory diseases and liver conditions. We synthesized new analogues to distinguish 2-cyclopropyl antagonist 17 (orthosteric interaction demonstrated by binding and predicted computationally) from PAMs (derivatives with large 2-alkyl/cycloalkyl/bicycloalkyl groups). We predicted PAM binding at a hydrophobic site on the A3AR cytosolic interface. Although having low Caco-2 permeability and high plasma protein binding, hydrophobic 2-cyclohept-4-enyl-N-3,4-dichlorophenyl, MRS7788 18, and 2-heptan-4-yl-N-4-iodophenyl, MRS8054 39, derivatives were orally bioavailable in rat. 2-Heptan-4-yl-N-3,4-dichlorophenyl 14 and 2-cyclononyl-N-3,4-dichlorophenyl 20 derivatives and 39 greatly enhanced Cl-IB-MECA-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding Emax, with only 12b trending toward decreasing the agonist EC50. A feasible route for radio-iodination at the p-position of a 4-phenylamino substituent suggests a potential radioligand for allosteric site binding. Herein, we advanced an allosteric approach to developing A3AR-activating drugs that are potentially event-and site-specific in action.	[Fallot, Lucas B.; Suresh, R.

While testosterone and progesterone had no significant effect, several molecules with estrogenic activity (17 beta -estradiol, ethynylestradiol, and bisphenol A) provoked a decrease in intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation under 0.7 nM human LH stimulation. Adiponectin exhibited a bimodal dose-effect on LH response: synergistic between 2-125 ng/mL and inhibitory between 0.5-5 mu g/mL. In brief, our data indicate that estrogens and ADPN separately exert rapid (<1 h) inhibitory and/or synergistic effects on cAMP response to LH in mLTC-1 cells. As the inhibitory effect of each estrogenic molecule was observed after only 1-h preincubation, it might be mediated through the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) membrane receptor, but this remains to be demonstrated. The synergistic effect with low concentrations of ADPN with human Luteinizing Hormone (hLH) was observed with both fresh and frozen/thawed ADPN. In contrast, the inhibitory effect with high concentrations of ADPN was lost with frozen/thawed ADPN, suggesting deterioration of its polymeric structure.

Recently, [C-11] SAR127303 was developed as a promising radioligand for MAGL imaging. In this study, we aimed to quantify regional MAGL concentrations in the rat brain using positron emission tomography (PET) with [C-11] SAR127303. An irreversible two-tissue compartment model (2-TCMi, k(4) = 0) analysis was conducted to estimate quantitative parameters (k3, K-i(2-TCMi), and.k3). These parameters were successfully obtained with high identifiability (< 10 % COV) for the following regions ranked in order from highest to lowest: cingulate cortex > striatum > hippocampus > thalamus > cerebellum > hypothalamus approximate to pons. In vitro autoradiographs using [C-11] SAR127303 showed a heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity, as seen in the PET images. The K-i(2TCMi) and lambda k(3) values correlated relatively highly with in vitro binding (r > 0.4, P < 0.005). The K-i(2)-TCMi values showed high correlation and low underestimation (< 10%) compared with the slope of a Patlak plot analysis with linear regression (Ki Patlak). In conclusion, we successfully estimated regional net uptake value of [C-11] SAR127303 reflecting MAGL concentrations in rat brain regions for the first time.

The objective of this study was to develop a radioimmunoassay with a sufficiently low limit of detection to measure the testosterone-like immunoreactivity in smaller hair samples (5 mg) than used in earlier studies, and to compare three different extraction procedures. The competitive radioimmunoassay consisted of a polyclonal antiserum (immunogen testosterone-7 alpha-BSA) and a radioligand synthesised from testosterone-3-CMO-histamine. The within-assay and total coefficients of variation in the working range was 3% and 4.5%, respectively. The limit of detection was 0.87 pg/mL, which is equivalent to 0.12 pg/mg testosterone in 5 mg of hair. The concentration of testosterone-like immunoreactivity in hair samples was 1.23 (SD 0.47) pg/mg in women and 2.67 (SD 0.58) pg/mg in men (pulverised hair). Significantly improved precision was found when pulverised hair was used compared to non-pulverised hair. Our data indicate that pulverisation of the hair prior to hormone extraction is crucial. Detection limits fit for the intended purpose are achievable with 5 mg samples of hair.

Although a valuable target for pharmaceutical research, information about the structure and dynamics of these molecules remains limited due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient amounts of homogeneous and fully active receptors for in vitro studies. Recombinant expression of GPCRs as inclusion bodies provides the highest protein yields at lowest costs. But this strategy can only successfully be applied if the subsequent in vitro folding results in a high yield of active receptors and if this fraction can be receptors in a homogeneous form. Here, we followed that strategy to provide large quantities of the human neuropeptide Y receptor type 2 and determined the folding yield before and after ligand affinity chromatography using a radioligand binding assay. Directly after folding, we achieved a proportion of similar to 25% active receptor. This value could be increased to similar to 96% using ligand affinity chromatography. Thus, a very homogeneous sample of the Y2 receptor could be prepared that exhibited a K-D value of 0.1 +/- 0.05 nM for the binding of polypeptide Y, which represents one of the natural ligands of the Y2 receptor.

It is currently the only radiotracer available for imaging M2 receptors in human subjects with positron emission tomography. The present study reports on an improved method for the synthesis of [F-18]FP-TZTP, automated using a GE TRACERlab (TM) FXFN radiosynthesis module. A key facet was the use of a new precursor, 3-(4-(1-methyl-1.2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-3-yl)-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-ylthio)propyl 4-methylbenzenesulfonate. The precursor was fluorinated via nucleophilic displacement of the tosyloxy group by potassium cryptand [F-18]fluoride (K[F-18]/K-222) in CH3CN at 80 degrees C for 5 min, and purified by HPLC. Formulated [F-18]FP-TZTP was prepared in an uncorrected radiochemical yield of 29 +/- 4%, with a specific activity of 138 +/- 41 GBq/mu mol (3732 +/- 109mCi/mu mol) at the end of synthesis (35min; n = 3). This methodology offers higher yields, faster synthesis times, an optimized precursor, and simpler automation than previously reported. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In Sf9 cells expressing A(2A)R, beta 1, and gamma 2, co-expression of XLG alpha(olf) increased NECA-induced [S-35]GTP gamma S binding from approximately 130% to 300% of basal levels. Pharmacological characteristics of A(2A)R ligands on these cells were evaluated by using [H-3]ZM241385- and [S-35]GTP gamma S-binding assays. The rank order of the equilibrium binding constants (K-d or K-i ) of adenosine receptor ligands were [H-3]ZM241385 approximate to CGS15943 < MRS1220 << CV1808 approximate to NECA < CGS21680 approximate to adenosine < IBMECA < HEMADO approximate to CPA approximate to CCPA. The rank order of EC50 values for agonists were CV1808 approximate to NECA < adenosine approximate to CGS26180 < IBMECA < HEMADO approximate to CPA approximate to CCPA. This pharmacology is consistent with the literature for A(2A)R and suggests that Sf9 cells co-expressing A(2A)R, ss 1, gamma 2, and XLG alpha(olf) could serve as a heterologous expression system for A(2A)R drug screening.

Chlorination of 2-phenylethylamines was useful for the site direction of cyclization, but chlorine atoms were removed under Birch conditions so that chlorination had to be repeated to get the respective chlorinated dibenz[dg]azecines. The target compounds were tested for their affinity at the different human-cloned dopamine-receptor subtypes (D-1 family, D-2 family). Generally, hydroxylation and chlorination of the dibenz-azecines increased affinities significantly. 1-Chloro-2-hydroxyhexahydro-dibenz[d,g]azecine was a subnanomolar antagonist at both subtype families. 4-Chloro-3-hydroxy7-methyl-5,6,7,8,9,14-hexahydro-dibenz[d,g]azecine was identified as the most potent and selective dopamine D-5 receptor ligand described to date with K-i(D-1) = 0.83, K-i(D-2L) = 4.0, K-i(D-3) = 24.6, K-i(D-4) = 5.2 nM, and K-i(D-5) = 57 pM (radioligand binding experiments), respectively.

The introduction of this tag did not affect the radioligand binding properties of the receptor. CHO cells stably expressing this receptor were subjected during 16 It to varying concentrations of the agonist N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) in the absence or presence of 10 mu M of the allosteric enhancer PD 81,723 ((2-amino-4,5-dimethyl-3-thienyl)-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanone) or the allosteric inhibitor SCH-202676 (N-(2,3-diphenyl-1,2,4-thiadiazol-5(2H)-ylidene)methanamine). CPA itself was able to internalize 25% and 40% of the receptors at a concentration of 400 nM or 4 mu M, respectively. Addition of either PD 81,723 or SCH-202676 alone had no effect on internalization. However, with PD 81,723 a slight amount of internalization was obtained already at 40 nM of CPA and at 400 nM CPA 59% of the receptors internalized. SCH-202676 on the other hand effectively prevented CPA-induced internalization of the receptor. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We designed a new route based on the Kira-Vilsmeier reaction for the synthesis of this class of compounds. Some of the synthesized compounds showed A(3) adenosine receptor affinity in the nanomolar range and good selectivity as evaluated in radioligand binding assays at human (h) A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptor subtypes. We introduced several substituents on the 2-phenyl ring. In particular substitution at the 4-position by methyl, methoxy, and chlorine gave optimal activity and selectivity 6c (K(i)hA(1), A(2A)> 1000 nM, EC(50)hA(2B)> 1000 nM, K(i)hA(3) = 9 nM), 6d (K(i)hA(1), A(2A)> 1000 nM, EC(50)hA(2B)> 1000 nM, K(i)hA(3) = 16 nM), 6b (K(i)hA(1), A(2A)> 1000 nM, EC50-hA(2B)> 1000 nM, KihA3 = 19 nM). In conclusion, the 2-phenyl-2,5-dihydro-pyrazolo[4,3-c]quinolin-4-one derivatives described herein represent a new family of in vitro selective antagonists for the adenosine A(3) receptor.

Mice were untreated (A) or treated with oestradiol cypionate (200 mug/kg) 24 h (13) or 96 It (C) before experimentation, or were pregnant (day 17) (D). Saturation radioligand binding experiments using [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([H-3] QNB) indicated similar muscarinic receptor densities and affinities in bladders from groups A and B. Neither oestrogen treatment nor pregnancy altered pD(2) estimates for methacholine. Maximum responses to methacholine and high-K+ physiological salt solution (KPSS) were significantly greater (P < 0.05) in tissues from groups C and D than in A and B. Potencies of other muscarinic receptor agonists were similar in groups A and B with an order of acetylcholine plus physostigmine (10 muM) approximate to methacholine plus physostigmine (10 muM)>methacholine approximate to acetylcholine>bethanechol.

Semi-quantitative analysis demonstrated that, depending on the hippocampal layer, 72-88% of CB1-expressing interneurons coexpress the 5-HT3A subunit. Within the DG, 5-HT3A/CB1 double-labeled neurons were confined to the subgranular layer, where close to 80% of all CB1 -expressing basket neurons were found to contain 5-HT3A subunit transcripts. These results provide the first evidence indicating that the only ion channel receptor for serotonin and central CB1 cannabinoid receptor coexist in neurons containing the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These findings suggest possible interactions between the cannabinoid and serotonergic systems at the level of GABA neurotransmission. However, activation of 5-HT3- or CB1-receptors are likely to have opposing regulatory effects on GABA neurotransmission, as 5-HT3 receptor activation by serotonin results in the release of GABA, while CB1 activation by cannabinoids results in inhibition of GABA release.

Material and Methods: After Lu-177 PSMA I&T treatment was administered to 54 patients, maximum count, pixel count (tumor extent) and sum (total tumor burden) values were calculated with a semiautomatic program. The images after the first treatment were evaluated as basal disease images. Images obtained after the second treatment were considered the response to the first cycle treatment. Results: It was determined that the number of maximum counts (p: 0.015) and tumor extent (p: 0.014) were significantly reduced after one cycle of Lu177 PSMA treatment. No significant change in total tumor burden (p:0.206) was detected. After one treatment cycle the maximum count in 46% of the patients and the total tumor burden in 63% of the patients. The number of pixels (tumor prevalence) in 41% of the patients decreased by >= 25%. Based on the Naive-Bayes method, one-year survival accuracy was 71.6%. Conclusion: With the texture analysis and machine learning of the Lu-177 PSMA post-therapy images, treatment response and survival were determined with high accuracy.

Neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) has been previously demonstrated in various pediatric tumors, but limited information exists on the expression and characteristics of SST receptors (SSTR) in hematological and oncological disorders of children. We aimed to investigate the expression of mRNA for SSTR subtypes (SSTR-1-5) in 15 pediatric hematological/oncological specimens by RT-PCR. The presence and binding characteristics of SSTRs were further studies by ligand competition assay. Our results show that the pediatric tumor samples highly expressed mRNA for the five SSTR subtypes with various patterns. The mRNA for SSTR-2 was detected in all specimens independently of their histological type. A Hodgkin lymphoma sample co-expressed mRNA for all five SSTR subtypes. SSTR-3 and SSTR-5 were detected only in malignant specimens, such as rhabdomyosarcoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and a single nonmalignant condition, hereditary spherocytosis. The incidence of SSTR-1 and SSTR-4 was similar (60%) in the 15 specimens investigated. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated the presence of specific SSTRs and high affinity binding of SST analogs in pediatric solid tumors investigated. The high incidence of SSTRs in hematological and oncological disorders in children supports the merit of further investigation of SSTRs as molecular targets for diagnosis and therapy.

As new linkers two carbon atoms (ethyl or ethenyl) or an oxyalkyl chain (methoxy, 2-ethoxy, 2-propoxy) were introduced. Affinities of the compounds for the 5-HT6R as the main target, and for the 5-HT1AR, 5-HT7R and D2R as competitive ones, were determined in the radioligand binding assays. Docking to the 5-HT6R homology model was performed to support SAR analysis. Results showed that the branching of the methoxyl linker increased affinity for the human 5-HT6R whereas an unsaturated bond within the linker dramatically reduced desirable activity. Both experimental and theoretical studies confirmed the previously postulated beneficial role of the aromatic size for interaction with the 5-HT6R. Thus, the largest naphthyl moiety yielded the highest activity. In particular, 4-(4-methylpiperazin 1 yl)-6-(1-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)ethyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (24), the most potent 5-HT6R agent found (K-i = 23 nM), can be a new lead structure for further search and development.

Sigma-2 Receptor/TMEM97 and PGRMC-1 Increase the Rate of Internalization of LDL by LDL Receptor through the Formation of a Ternary Complex	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MEMBRANE COMPONENT 1; LOW-DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN; BREAST-CANCER; CELL-CYCLE; PROLIFERATION; PROGESTERONE; CHOLESTEROL; BINDING; IDENTIFICATION; MODULATOR	CRISPR/Cas gene studies were conducted in HeLa cells where either PGRMC1, TMEM97 or both proteins were removed via gene editing. A series of radioligand binding studies, confocal microscopy studies, and internalization of radiolabeled or fluorescently tagged LDL particles were then conducted in these cells. The results indicate that PGRMC1 knockout (KO) did not reduce the density of binding sites for the sigma-2 receptor (sigma 2R) radioligands, [I-125]RHM-4 or [H-3]DTG, but a reduction in the receptor affinity of both radioligands was observed. TMEM97 KO resulted in a complete loss of binding of [I-125]RHM-4 and a significant reduction in binding of [H-3]DTG. TMEM97 KO and PGRMC1 KO resulted in an equal reduction in the rate of uptake of fluorescently-tagged or H-3-labeled LDL, and knocking out both proteins did not result in a further rate of reduction of LDL uptake. Confocal microscopy and Proximity Ligation Assay studies indicated a clear co-localization of LDLR, PGRMC1 and TMEM97. These data indicate that the formation of a ternary complex of LDLR-PGRMC1-TMEM97 is necessary for the rapid internalization of LDL by LDLR.

Pharmacologically significant amounts of solifenacin were excreted in the urine of humans taking a clinical dose of this drug. The aim of this study is to measure muscarinic receptor binding in the bladder urothelium and detrusor muscles of rats following the intravesical instillation of solifenacin. Muscarinic receptors were measured by radioreceptor assay using [N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine methyl chloride ([H-3]NMS), a selective radioligand of muscarinic receptors. Solifenacin showed concentration-dependent inhibition of specific [H-3]NMS binding in the bladder urothelium and detrusor muscle of rats, with no significant difference in K-i values or Hill coefficients between these tissues. Following the intravesical instillation of solifenacin, there was significant muscarinic receptor binding (increase in K-d for specific [H-3]NMS binding) in the bladder urothelium and detrusor muscle of rats. Similar bladder muscarinic receptor binding was observed by the intravesical instillation of oxybutynin, but not with trospium. In conclusion, the present study has demonstrated that solifenacin binds muscarinic receptors not only in the detrusor muscle but also in the bladder urothelium with high affinity. These bladder muscarinic receptors may be significantly affected by solifenacin excreted in the urine.

The aims of this study were to perform kinetic modeling of [C-11](R)-rolipram in healthy humans using an arterial input function and to replace this arterial input in humans with an image-derived input function. Methods: Twelve humans had two injections of [C-11](R)-rolipram. An image-derived input function was obtained from the carotid arteries and four blood samples. The samples were used for partial volume correction and for estimating the parent concentration using HPLC analysis. Results: An unconstrained two-compartment model and Logan analysis measured distribution volume V-T, with good identifiability but with moderately high retest variability (15%). Similar results were obtained using the image input (ratio image/arterial V-T = 1.00 +/- 0.06). Conclusions: Binding of [C-11](R)-rolipram to PDE4 can be quantified in human brain using kinetic modeling and an arterial input function. Image input function from carotid arteries provides an equally accurate and reproducible method to quantify PDE4. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Alpha-conotoxin MII-sensitive nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are involved in mediating the ghrelin-induced locomotor stimulation and dopamine overflow in nucleus accumbens	EUROPEAN NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						ghrelin; nicotinic acetylcholine; receptors; reward systems	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; VOLUNTARY ETHANOL INTAKE; CHOLINERGIC NEURONS; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; BRAIN DOPAMINE; RAT; RELEASE; MECAMYLAMINE; ALCOHOLISM	Previously, we have reported that the orexigenic peptide ghrelin activates the cholinergic-dopaminergic reward [ink, involving nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). The alpha(3)-alpha(7) and beta(2)-beta(4) subunits of the nAChR can be combined into pentameric nAChRs, with different functional roles. The present experiments show that the locomotor stimulatory effects of ghrelin, either into laterodorsal tegmental area (LDTg) or ventral tegmental area (VTA), are mediated via ventral tegmental nAChR, but neither the alpha(4)beta(2)* (using dihydro-beta-erythroidine) nor the alpha(7)* (using methyllycaconitine) subtypes appears to be involved. On the other hand, the alpha(3)beta(2)*, beta(3)*, and/or alpha(6)* (using a.-conotoxin MII) subtypes in the VTA mediate the stimulatory and DA-enhancing effects of ghrelin, a pattern that ghrelin shares with ethanol (n= 5-8). Radioligand-binding experiments shown that ghrelin does not interfere directly with nAChRs (n=26). We therefore suggest that the alpha(3)beta(2)*, beta* and/or alpha(6)* subtypes might be pharmacological targets for treatment of addictive behaviours; including compulsive overeating and alcoholism.

Acetonitrile denaturation and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed predominantly unchanged (91-98%) parent tracer in all brain tissues examined. compared to significant metabolism (23% parent) in the plasma at 90 min postinjection, and control tissue recovery of 95-98%. [I-123]5-1A was distributed to the thalamus with a standardized uptake value of 9.2 (0.04% dose/g) or a concentration 5.8 times higher than that of the cerebellum. The HPLC behavior of a synthesized sample of one hypothesized metabolite, 5-iodo-3-pyridinol (5-IP), was consistent with plasma radiometabolite fraction. Since only parent radiotracer Compound was found in brain tissue, these results add confidence that information derived from single photon emission computed tomography images of I-123 activity in the brain after [I-123]5-1A administration can be interpreted as distribution of an intact radiotracer.

Gene knock-out studies suggest that PGI(2) is essential to endometrial decidualization, but the effects of PGI(2) on sperm and embryos have not been reported. METHODS: The effects of PGI(2) on human sperm were analysed by a computer-assisted semen analysis system. The effects of PGI(2) on mouse embryos were examined based on the rates of complete hatching. The expression of PGI(2) receptor (IP) was evaluated by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The binding of PGI(2) to embryos was confirmed by radioligand binding assay. Finally, cAMP levels were assessed in PGI(2)-challenged embryos. RESULTS: Iloprost (a stable PGI(2) analogue) did not affect the motility or the overnight survivability of human sperm. Western blot analysis did not detect IP in the sperm plasma membrane. In contrast, the hatching of mouse embryos was enhanced by iloprost (ED50 6.7 nmol/l). Exposure to iloprost during 8-cell to morulae or morulae to early blastocyst stages was critical to enhanced hatching. This coincided with the developmental stage-specific expression of IP. Although iloprost bound to blastocysts, it did not significantly increase cAMP. CONCLUSION: PGI(2) enhanced the hatching of mouse embryos but not the motility of human sperm.

In alpha(1D)(-/-) mice, the RT-PCR did not detect any transcript of the alpha(1D)-AR in any tissue examined, and there was no apparent upregulation of other alpha(1)-AR subtypes. Radioligand binding studies showed that alpha(1)-AR binding capacity in the aorta was lost, while that in the heart was unaltered in alpha(1D)(-/-) mice. Non-anesthetized alpha(1)(-/-) mice maintained significantly lower basal systolic and mean arterial blood pressure conditions, relative to wild-type mice, and they showed no significant change in heart rate or in cardiac function, as assessed by echocardiogram. Besides hypotension, the pressor responses to phenylephrine and norepinephrine were decreased by 30-40% in alpha(1D)(-/-) mice. Furthermore, the contractile response of the aorta and the pressor response of isolated perfused mesenteric arterial beds to alpha(1)-AR stimulation were markedly reduced in alpha(1D)(-/-) Mice. We conclude that the alpha(1D)-AR participates directly in sympathetic regulation of systemic blood pressure by vasoconstriction.

Salbutamol (0.0001-1 muM) produced concentration-dependent relaxation in bovine tracheal smooth muscle contracted with methacholine (0.3 muM). Mexiletine (5-500 muM) caused the rightward shifts of concentration-response curves for them relaxant responses to salbutamol in a concentration-dependent manner. Mexiletine (5, 50 or 500 muM) did not change basal cAMP levels, whereas it concentration-dependently attenuated the salbutamol (0.1 muM)-induced cAMP accumulation. On the other hand, mexiletine (500 muM) did not change the concentration-response curves for the relaxant responses to forskolin (0.001-10 LM). Mexiletine slightly but significantly (P <0.05) increased forskolin (1 muM)-induced cAMP accumulation. In radioligand binding experiments, mexiletine concentration-dependently displaced the specific binding of [I-125]cyanopindolol to beta -adrenoceptors on bovine tracheal smooth muscle membranes. By contrast, lidocaine, another class Ib antiarrhythmic drug, did not change the binding of [I-125]cyanopindolol. These results demonstrate that mexiletine prevents the binding Of beta (2)-adrenoceptor agonists to their receptors and thereby suppresses manifestation of subsequent pharmacological responses.

Now, more clinical trials are under way to evaluate a-emitting targeted thera- pies as potential next-generation theranostics with even higher efficacy due to their high linear energy and short range in human tissues. In this review, we summarize the important studies ranging from the first Food and Drug Administration-approved a-therapy, 223Ra-dichloride, for treatment of bone metastases in castration-resistant prostate cancer, including concepts in clinical translation such as targeted a-peptide receptor radiotherapy and225Ac-PSMA-617 for treatment of prostate cancer, innovative therapeutic models evaluating new targets, and combination therapies. Targeted a-therapy is one of the most promis- ing fields in novel targeted cancer therapy, with several early- and late - stage clinical trials for neuroendocrine tumors and metastatic prostate cancer already in progress, along with significant interest and invest- ment in additional early-phase studies. Together, these studies will help us understand the short- and long-term toxicity of targeted a-therapy and potentially identify suitable therapeutic combination partners.

The blood-brain barrier (BBB), blood-brain tumor barrier (BBTB) hinder the entry of therapeutics into the glioma region. Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) formed by invasive glioma cells is also related to recurrence of GBM. VAP is a D-peptide ligand of GRP78 protein overexpressed on BBTB, VM, and glioma cells but not on normal tissues. Besides, p-hydroxybenzoic acid (pHA) can effectively traverse the BBB. Herein we developed an all-stage glioma-targeted cabazitaxel (CBZ) nanocrystal loaded liposome modified with a "Y " shaped targeting ligand composed of pHA and VAP (pV-Lip/cNC). The pure drug nanocrystal core provided high drug loading, while lipid membrane promoted the stability and circulation time. pV-Lip/cNC exhibited excellent glioma homing, barriers crossing, and tumor spheroid penetrating capability in vitro. Treatment of pV-Lip/cNC displayed enhanced CBZ accu-mulation in glioma and anti-glioma effect with a median survival time (53 days) significantly longer than that of cNC loaded liposomes modified with either single ligand (42 days for VAP and 45 days for pHA) in the murine orthotopic GBM model. These results indicated pV-Lip/cNC could traverse the BBB and BBTB, destruct VM, and finally kill glioma cells to realize all-stage glioma therapy.

W.T, has been identified as a dopamine receptor antagonist. We extended our assessment of its pharmacological profile and found that DHCB exhibits high to moderate binding affinities to sigma 1 and 2 receptors, serotonin 5-HT7 receptor, and histamine H2 receptors. This led us to evaluate DHCB properties in pharmacological (apomorphine and MK-801) animal models of schizophrenia in mice. The pharmacological profile of DHCB was screened through radioligand receptor binding assays. Single dose of DHCB reversed the locomotor hyperactivity, stereotypy, and prepulse inhibition deficits induced by the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. DHCB also reversed the depressive-like behavior and memory deficit induced by the glutamatergic antagonist MK-801 in the forced swim and the novel object recognition assays, respectively. These results indicate that DHCB effectively improves schizophrenia-like behavioral deficits that are induced by the disruption of dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. The effectiveness of DHCB in reversing responses that mimic negative and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia might suggest that its anti-schizophrenia effects are mediated through modulating the activities of several receptor particularly sigma 1, sigma 2, 5-HT7 and dopamine receptors. Our study casts DHCB as a promising lead for therapeutic treatment of schizophrenia.

For many targets, systematic research for binding kinetics is emerging and reported, as in case of the histamine H-3 receptor. Alternatively, fluorescent methods based on Foerster resonance energy transfer have been reported recently but application of fluorescence polarization to kinetics of unlabeled ligands is not known to us. Thus, we established a radiolabel-free, real-time resolving method that is compatible to high-throughput-screening programs with the objective to explore the underlying binding kinetics. This method takes benefit of bodilisant as H-3 receptor ligand. Thereby, we detected short residence times around 5 min for the H-3 receptor ligands ciproxifan, clobenpropit, thioperamide as well as pitolisant. Monitoring association rates, remarkably slower association rate constants were examined for ciproxifan and thioperamide when compared to those of pitolisant or clobenpropit. The affinities for the ligands derived by the kinetic approach differ from affinity estimates in literature using radiolabeled agonists in displacement assays. Further investigation raised exceptional pharmacological properties, consistent with occurrence of secondary binding sites at the H-3 receptor. Validation of resulting affinity constants was successfully performed by displacement assays based on fluorescence polarization with bodilisant.

Identification, expression and functional characterization of M<sub>4</sub>L, a muscarinic acetylcholine M<sub>4</sub> receptor splice variant	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; SURFACE EXPRESSION; SYSTEM; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SEQUENCE; DNA	Rodent genomic alignment sequences support a 2-exon model for muscarinic M-4 receptor. Using this model a novel N-terminal extension was discovered in the human muscarinic acetylcholine M-4 receptor. An open reading frame was discovered in the human, mouse and rat with a common ATG (methionine start codon) that extended the N-terminus of the muscarinic acetylcholine M-4 receptor subtype by 155 amino acids resulting in a longer variant. Transcriptional evidence for this splice variant was confirmed by RNA-Seq and RT-PCR experiments performed from human donor brain prefrontal cortices. We detected a human upstream exon indicating the translation of the mature longer M-4 receptor transcript. The predicted size for the longer two-exon M-4 receptor splice variant with the additional 155 amino acid N-terminal extension, designated M4L is 69.7 kDa compared to the 53 kDa canonical single exon M-4 receptor (M4S). Western blot analysis from a mammalian overexpression system, and saturation radioligand binding with [H-3]-NMS (N-methyl-scopolamine) demonstrated the expression of this new splice variant. Comparative pharmacological characterization between the M4L and M4S receptors revealed that both the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites for both receptors were very similar despite the addition of an N-terminal extension.

The present study developed a virtual screening (VS) method to identify food components, which may modulate D2R signalling. In contrast to their common applications in drug discovery, VS methods are rarely applied for the discovery of bioactive food compounds. Here, databases were created that exclusively contain substances occurring in food and natural sources (about 13,000 different compounds in total) as the basis for combined pharmacophore searching, hit-list clustering and molecular docking into D2R homology models. From 17 compounds finally tested in radioligand assays to determine their binding affinities, seven were classified as hits (hit rate = 41%). Functional properties of the five most active compounds were further examined in beta-arrestin recruitment and cAMP inhibition experiments. D2R-promoted G-protein activation was observed for hordenine, a constituent of barley and beer, with approximately identical ligand efficacy as dopamine (76%) and a K vertical bar value of 13 mu M. Moreover, hordenine antagonised D2-mediated beta-arrestin recruitment indicating functional selectivity. Application of our databases provides new perspectives for the discovery of bioactive food constituents using VS methods. Based on its presence in beer, we suggest that hordenine significantly contributes to mood-elevating effects of beer.

Method: The [H-3]pirenzepine binding using autoradiography and in situ hybridization with oligonucleotides specific for muscarinic M1 and M4 receptors were completed using hippocampal tissue obtained postmortem from 20 control subjects and 20 subjects with schizophrenia. Results: The [H-3]pirenzepine binding was decreased in the dentate gyrus (p <.05), CA3 (p <.01), CA2 (p <.05), and CA1 (P <.01) regions of the hippocampus from subjects with schizophrenia. Levels of M4 mRNA varied with the diagnosis of schizophrenia (p = .01), but significant region-specific changes were not apparent. Changes in levels of mRNA for the muscarinic M1 receptor were not detected with diagnosis. Conclusions: This study suggests that decreases in hippocampal [H-3]pirenzepine binding in subjects with schizophrenia are most likely associated with widespread changes in expression levels of the M4 receptor. These data further implicate the hippocampal formation in the pathology of schizophrenia.

This new radioiodinated tracer exhibited high brain uptake (3.64% injected dose per gram of tissue at 10 min p.i.) in mice. No significant amounts (less than 5%) of labeled metabolites were present in the brain, as demonstrated by a metabolite study. Regional brain distribution in rabbits showed atypical CNS uptake with consistently low values in the cortex and high values in other brain parts including cerebellum. Saturable binding was confirmed by a competition experiment with unlabeled product. Selectivity was assessed by competition experiments with a known dopamine D-4 ligand and later with a a receptor ligand. Both experiments showed no observable competition. In conclusion, our findings indicate that [I-123]-ITCP is neither a dopamine D-4 receptor ligand nor a sigma receptor ligand. The exact nature of [I-123]-ITCP binding it, the brain remains to be elucidated. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The compounds were synthesized by substituting the chlorine atom of benzonaphthyridines and azepinoquinolines with various N-alkyl-4-piperidinylmethanolates. They were evaluated in binding assays with [H-3]GR 113808 as the 5-HT4 receptor radioligand. The affinity values (K-i or inhibition percentages) depended upon the substituent on the aromatic ring on one hand and the substituent, on the lateral piperidine chain on the other hand. A chlorine atom produced a marked drop in activity while a N-propyl or N-butyl group gave compounds with nanomolar affinities (1 < K-i < 10 nM). Among the most potent ligands (3a, 4a, 5a), 4a was selected on the. basis of its high affinity and selectivity for pharmacological screening and was evaluated in vivo in specific tests. This compound reveals itself as an antagonist/low partial agonist in the COS-7 cells stably expressing the 5-HT4(a) receptor. Derivative 4a also showed in vivo potent analgesic activity in the writhing test at very low doses.

To get a better insight of cell death and protective mechanisms in DA/Fe2+-induced toxicity, we investigated the effects of DA/Fe2+ and the antioxidant action of 17 beta -estradiol (E2) in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). We found that DA/Fe2+-induces apoptosis in PBL via a hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated oxidative mechanism, which in turn triggers a cascade of molecular events requiring RNA and de novo protein synthesis. We have also demonstrated that E2 prevents significantly DA/Fe2+-induced apoptosis in PBL by directly inhibiting the intracellular accumulation of peroxides generated by DA/Fe2+-reaction. This protective activity is independent of the presence or activation of the estrogen receptors (ERs). These data further support and validate our previous hypothesis that DA/Fe2+/H2O2 could be a general mediator of oxidative stress through a common cell death mechanism in both neuronal and nonneuronal cells. These findings may be particularly relevant to the potential approaches to rescue and prolong the survival of neurons by estrogens in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).

High Interobserver Agreement on PSMA PET/CT Even in the Absence of Clinical Data	CLINICAL NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate-specific membrane antigen; PSMA; reporting and data system; RADS	CLASSIFICATION; IMAGES; MITNM	BackgroundRecommended by current guidelines, prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-directed PET/CT is increasingly used in men with prostate cancer (PC). We aimed to provide concordance rates using the PSMA reporting and data system (RADS) for scan interpretation and also determine whether such agreement rates are affected by available patient characteristics at time of scan.Patients and MethodsSixty men with PC, who all underwent Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT, were included. Three independent, experienced readers indicated general scan parameters (including overall scan result, organ or lymph node [LN] involvement, and appropriateness of radioligand therapy). Applying PSMA-RADS 1.0, observers also had to conduct RADS scoring on a target lesion (TL) and overall scan level. During the first read, observers were masked to all relevant clinical information, whereas on a second read, relevant patient characteristics were displayed, thereby allowing for determination of impact of available clinical information for scan interpretation. We used intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs; with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]), which were then rated according to Cicchetti (0.4-0.59 fair, 0.6-0.74 good, and 0.75-1 excellent agreement).ResultsFor general parameters, agreement rates were excellent, including an overall scan result (ICC, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76-0.90), LN metastases (ICC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.83-0.93), organ involvement (ICC, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72-0.89), and indication for radioligand therapy (ICC, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90-0.96). Overall RADS scoring was also excellent with an ICC of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.96-09.4). On a TL-based level, 251 different lesions were selected by the 3 observers (with 73 chosen by all 3 readers). RADS-based concordance rates were fair to excellent: all lesions, ICC of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.67-0.85); LN, ICC of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.63-0.92); skeleton, ICC of 0.55 (95% CI, 0-0.84); and prostate, ICC of 0.48 (95% CI, 0.17-0.78). When performing a second read displaying patient's characteristics, there were only minor modifications to the previously applied RADS scoring on a TL-based level (overall, n = 8): each reader 1 and 2 in 3/60 (5%) instances, and reader 3 in 2/60 (3.3%) instances. The main reason for recategorization (mainly upstaging) was provided information on PSA levels (4/8, 50%).ConclusionsApplying PSMA-RADS, concordance rates were fair to excellent, whereas relevant modifications were rarely observed after providing clinical data. As such, even in the absence of patient information, standardized frameworks still provide guidance for reading PSMA PETs. Those findings may have implications for a high throughput in a busy PET practice, where patient details cannot always be retrieved at time of scan interpretation or in the context of clinical trials or central reviews in which readers may be blinded to clinical data.

Monomeric radiotracers have shown great potential in molecular imaging (diagnosis), but the tumor retention time is relatively short (few hours). For effective radioligand therapy (RLT), the biological half-life of the radiotracer should ideally match the physical half-life of the important therapeutic radionuclides Lu-177 and Ac-225 (6.7 and 9.9 days). The tumor retention was improved with the FAPi homodimer DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). In terms of optimizing, the new FAPi homodimers DO3A.Glu.(FAPi)(2) and DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2).were synthesized. DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) showed superior radiolabeling properties (including successful Ac-225-labeling, higher hydrophilicity), in vitro affinity and selectivity compared to DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). In addition, significantly reduced uptake in the critical organs (liver, colon) compared to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2) was observed with [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) in a first patient study (medullary thyroid cancer) while maintaining high and prolonged tumor uptake. Radiopharmaceuticals based on the highly potent FAP inhibitor (FAPi) UAMC-1110 have shown great potential in molecular imaging, but the short tumor retention time of the monomers do not match the physical half-lives of the important therapeutic radionuclides Lu-177 and Ac-225. This was improved with the dimer DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2), but pharmacological and radiolabeling properties still need optimization. Therefore, the novel FAPi homodimers DO3A.Glu.(FAPi)(2) and DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2). were synthesized and quantitatively radiolabeled with Ga-68, Y-90, Lu-177 and Ac-225. The radiolabeled complexes showed high hydrophilicity and were generally stable in human serum (HS) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37 degrees C over two half-lives, except for [Ac-225]Ac-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) in PBS. In vitro affinity studies resulted in subnanomolar IC50 values for FAP and high selectivity for FAP over the related proteases PREP and DPP4 for both compounds as well as for [Lu-nat]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2). In a first proof-of-principle patient study (medullary thyroid cancer), [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) was compared to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). High uptake and long tumor retention was observed in both cases, but [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) significantly reduces uptake in non-target and critical organs (liver, colon). Overall, the novel FAPi homodimer DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) showed improved radiolabeling in vitro and pharmacological properties in vivo compared to DOTAGA.(SA.FAPi)(2). [Lu-177]Lu-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) and [Ac-225]Ac-DOTAGA.Glu.(FAPi)(2) appear promising for translational application in patients.

Little is known about bone metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) resistance to radiation. Methods: We filtered the metastatic eRNA using RNA-seq, MeRIP-seq, RT-qPCR and bioinformation. Western blot, RT-qPCR, CLIP, co-IP and RNA pull-down assays were used for RNA/protein interaction, RNA or protein expression examination. MTS assay was used to determine cell viability in vitro, xenograft assay was used to examine the tumor growth in mice. Results: In this study, we screened and identified bone-specific N6 adenosine methylation (m6A) on enhancer RNA (eRNA) that played a post-transcriptional functional role in bone mPCa and was correlated with radiotherapy (RT) resistance. Further data demonstrated that RNA-binding protein KHSRP recognized both m6A at eRNA and m6Am at 5'-UTR of mRNA to block RNA degradation from exoribonuclease XRN2. Depletion of the MLXIPe/KHSRP/PSMD9 regulatory complex inhibited tumor growth and RT sensitization of bone mPCa xenograft in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that a bone-specific m6A-modified eRNA plays a vital role in regulating mPCa progression and RT resistance and might be a novel specific predictor for cancer RT.

Thus, the identification of ligands which selectively act on peripheral CB1Rs, is becoming more interesting. A recent study reported a class of peripheral CB1R selective antagonists, characterized by a 5-aryl substituted nicotinamide core. These derivatives have structural similarities with the biphenyl compounds, endowed with CB2R antagonist activity, previously synthesized by our research group. In this work we combined the pharmacophoric portion of both classes, in order to obtain novel CBR antagonists. Among the synthesized compounds rather unexpectedly two compounds of this series, C7 and C10, did not show the radioligand ([H-3]CP55940) displacement on CB1R but increased binding (~ 150%), suggesting a possible allosteric behavior. Computational studies were performed to investigate the role of these compounds in CB1R modulation. The analysis of their binding poses in two different binding cavities of the CB1R surface, revealed a preferred interaction with the experimental binding site for negative allosteric modulators.

Identification of a Novel Allosteric Site at the M<sub>5</sub> Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						allosteric modulation; M-5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor; computational biology; mutagenesis; selectivity	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; AMINO-ACID; SUBTYPE SELECTIVITIES; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; M1; CLASSIFICATION; GALLAMINE	The M-5 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) has emerged as an exciting therapeutic target for the treatment of addiction and behavioral disorders. This has been in part due to promising preclinical studies with the M-5 mAChR selective negative allosteric modulator (NAM), ML375. The binding site of ML375 remains unknown, however, making it difficult to develop improved M-5 mAChR selective modulators. To determine the possible location of the ML375 binding site, we used radioligand binding and functional assays to show that ML375 does not interact with the well-characterized "common" mAChR allosteric site located in the receptor's extracellular vestibule, nor a previously proposed second allosteric site recognized by the modulator, amiodarone. Molecular docking was used to predict potential allosteric sites within the transmembrane (TM) domain of the M-5 mAChR These predicted sites were assessed using M-5-M-2 mAChR receptor chimeras and further targeted with site-directed mutagenesis, which enabled the identification of a putative binding site for ML375 at the interface of TMs 2-4. Collectively, these results identify a third allosteric site at the M-5 mAChR and highlight the ability of allosteric modulators to selectively target highly conserved proteins.	[Burger, Wessel A.

We have designed EDTA conjugated SPECT imaging probe for localization of 5HT1A receptor in brain. For designing SPECT probe we have employed the concept of bivalent approach and a homodimeric system with desirable pharmacokinetics of 5HT1A imaging. 99mTc-EDHT was also evaluated for its stability through serum stability assay and glutathione challenge experiment. Biodistribution study showed the highest accumulation of radioactivity in kidney which depicted the renal mode of excretion from the body. However in brain the uptake of 1.21% ID per gram was observed in initial 5 min of drug administration. On blocking the receptor this percent get decreased to 0.97% ID per gram. The regional distribution in brain was also performed which showed the accumulation of drug in cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus part, which are already known for 5HT1A expression.

Tran			Comparison of HER2-Targeted Antibodies for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery in Breast Cancer	MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article							GROWTH-FACTOR; SURGICAL NAVIGATION; IRDYE 800CW; RECEPTOR; SAFETY; PET/CT; ZR-89-TRASTUZUMAB; BIODISTRIBUTION; HETEROGENEITY; PERTUZUMAB	Background. Although therapeutic advances have led to enhanced survival in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer, detection of residual disease remains challenging. Here, we examine two approved anti-HER2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), trastuzumab and pertuzumab, as potential candidates for the development of immunoconjugates for fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS). Methods. mAbs were conjugated to the near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye, IRDye800, and for quantitative in vitro assessment, to the radiometal chelator, desferrioxamine, to enable dual labeling with Zr-89. In vitro binding was evaluated in HER2-overexpressing (BT474, SKBR3) and HER2-negative (MCF7) cell lines. BT474 and MCF7 xenografts were used for in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence imaging. Results. In vitro findings demonstrated HER2-mediated binding for both fluorescent immunoconjugates and were in agreement with radioligand assays using dual-labeled immunoconjugates. In vivo and ex vivo studies showed preferential accumulation of the fluorescently-labeled mAbs in tumors and similar tumor-to-background ratios. In vivo HER2 specificity was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of resected tumors and normal tissues. Conclusions. We showed for the first time that fluorescent trastuzumab and pertuzumab immunoconjugates have similar NIRF imaging performance and demonstrated the possibility of performing HER2-targeted FGS with agents that possess distinct epitope specificity.

Identification of monoclonal antibodies suitable for blocking IGF-1 receptors in the horse	DOMESTIC ANIMAL ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Equine; Insulin dysregulation; Laminitis	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; I RECEPTOR; BINDING-SPECIFICITY; LIGAND-BINDING; INSULIN; LAMINITIS; HYPERINSULINEMIA; COMBINATION; STIMULATE; PATHOLOGY	Prolonged hyperinsulinemia is thought to be the cause of equine endocrinopathic laminitis, a common and crippling disease of the foot, for which there are no pharmacologic treatments other than pain relief. It has been suggested that insulin causes its effects on the lamellae by activating IGF-1 receptors (IGF-1R), as insulin receptors (InsR) are scarce in this tissue, whereas IGF-1R are abundant and become downregulated after prolonged insulin infusion. As a first step toward confirming this mechanism and beginning to develop a therapeutic anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibody (mAb) for horses, it was necessary to identify available human IGF-1R mAbs that would recognize equine receptors. Four IGF-1R mAbs were tested using soluble equine IGF-1R, with ELISA and flow cytometry. Frozen equine lamellar and liver tissue was also used in radioligand binding assays. The results demonstrated that only one of the mAbs tested (mAb1) was able to compete effectively with IGF-1 for binding to its receptors in equine lamellar tissue, with an IC50 of 5 to 159 ng/mL. None of the 4 mAbs were able to bind to equine hepatic InsR. This study has generated valuable structure-activity information and has identified a prototype anti-IGF-1R mAb suitable for further development. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Two of these ligands (6a,b) were successfully labeled with Tc-99m radionuclide at high radiochemical purity using fac-(Tc-99(m)(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+) synthon. [Tc-99m]7a and [Tc-99m]7b were evaluated as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging agents for A beta plaque in AD. [Tc-99m]7a and (Tc-99m]7b exhibited suitable affinity toward A beta aggregates with IC50 values of 33.2 and 102.5 nM, respectively. The IC50 value of these radiotracers depends on the length of the spacer (alkyl chain). In biodistribution study, these complexes showed good initial brain uptakes (0.78 and 0.86% ID/g at 2 min post-injection) and fast blood clearance. Autoradiography results confirmed that these small Tc-99m complexes (Mw about 600 Da) can bind to A beta plaques in the brain sections of the rat AD model. Histopathological staining with Congo red approved the presence of A beta plaques in these brain sections. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

CUMI-101 has agonistic properties in human embryonic kidney 293 cells transfected with human recombinant 5-HT1A receptors (Hendry et al. [2011] Nucl Med Biol 38:273277; Kumar et al. [2006] J Med Chem 49:125134) and has previously been demonstrated to be sensitive to bolus citalopram in monkeys (Milak et al. [2011] J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 31:243249). We studied six healthy individuals. Two PET-scans were performed on the same day in each individual before and after constant infusion of citalopram (0.15 mg/kg). The imaging data were analyzed using two tissue compartment kinetic modeling with metabolite corrected arterial input and Simplified Reference Tissue Modeling using cerebellum as a reference region. There was no significant difference in regional distribution volume or non-displaceable binding potential values before and after citalopram infusion. The mean receptor occupancy was 0.03 (range -0.14 to 0.17). Our data imply that [11C]CUMI-101 binding is not sensitive to citalopram infusion in humans. Synapse, 2012.

Here we review the current evidence on the dopaminergic system in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). PBL synthesize DA through the tyrosine-hydroxylase/DOPA-decarboxylase pathway, and express DA receptors and DA transporter (DAT) on their plasma membrane. Stimulation of DA receptors on PBL membrane contributes to modulate the development and initiation of immune responses under physiological conditions and in immune system pathologies such as autoimmunity or immunodeficiency. The characterization of DA system in PBL gave rise to a further line of research investigating the feasibility of PBL as a cellular model for studying DA derangement in neuropsychiatric disorders. Several reports showed changes of the expression of DAT and/or DA receptors in PBL from patients suffering from several neuropsychiatric disorders, in particular parkinsonian syndromes, schizophrenia and drug-or alcohol-abuse. Despite some methodological and theoretical limitations, these findings suggest that PBL may prove a cellular tool with which to identify the derangement of DA transmission in neuropsychiatric diseases, as well as to monitor the effects of pharmacological treatments.

However, this has not been convincingly demonstrated in human subjects. Most functions ascribed to the striatum have been linked to its dense dopaminergic innervation, from motor control to higher-order brain functions ( e. g., cognition), making the dopamine system a suitable probe for striatal function. Limbic striatum, a region involved in reward processing, has recently been implicated also in episodic memory function. Here we examined striatal dopamine D2-receptor binding in 16 healthy subjects using PET and the radioligand [C-11] raclopride, in relation to cognitive performance. Receptor availability in limbic striatum was related to performance in tests of episodic memory, but not to tests of verbal fluency and general knowledge. By contrast, D2 binding in associative and sensorimotor striatum was less strongly related to episodic memory, but showed associations to the non-episodic tasks.

Using in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography we measured [H-3]proplyamino-8-hydroxy- 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronapthalene, [H-3]ketanserin and [H-3]sumatriptan binding in hippocampi from 20 schizophrenic and 20 control subjects. There were significant decreases in the density of [H-3]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) 3 (p = 0.006), CA 1 (stratum radiatum p = 0.02; pyramidal layer p = 0.0008) and subiculum (pyramidal layer p = 0.0004), as well as methiothepin-insensitive [H-3]sumatriptan binding to the 5-HTIFR in the CA 1 (p = 0.016), stratum radiatum/lacunosum moleculare (p = 0.04) and subiculum (p = 0.015) from subjects with schizophrenia. Therewereno differences in the densities of 5-HT1AR, 5-HT(1D)Ror 5-HT4R in hippocampi from subjects with schizophrenia. These data support the hypothesis that regionally specific reductions in the density of the 5-HT2AR and 5-HTIFR are a component of the pathological processes underlying schizophrenia.

High expression levels of GC-A in the testis and reported effects of ANP on testosterone secretion by Leydig cells are indicative of important local functions in this organ. Here we show, based on radioligand receptor labeling and immunological approaches, that seminiferous tubules rather than Leydig cells are the predominant GC-A expression sites in the rat testis. Functional activity was proved by ANP-induced cGMP accumulation in isolated seminiferous tubules. Although ontogenetic studies revealed a massive increase in GC-A levels during sexual maturation, the so-called natriuretic peptide clearance receptor, another type of ANP receptor proposed to locally control the availability of natriuretic peptides, was found to be expressed predominantly before puberty, exceeding the level of GC-A expression at this time. Natriuretic peptide clearance receptor also shows a distinct distribution pattern surrounding the seminiferous tubules. These findings raise the possibility of novel physiological roles for ANP and cGMP in the testis related to germ cell maturation and/or the regulation of the onset of puberty and suggest that the two ANP receptors function in a coordinated manner at this target organ.

Recent animal studies showed an increase of neuronal firing in dopaminergic neurons under effective STN-DBS. Increased striatal dopamine levels may also contribute to the stimulation's mechanism of action in humans. We investigated the striatal dopamine release in 6 patients with advanced PD under effective bilateral STN-DBS with positron emission tomography (PET) of the reversible dopamine-D2/3-receptor ligand [C-11]raclopride (RACLO). Although STN-DBS proved to be a highly effective treatment in these subjects, we found no significant difference of the striatal RACLO binding between the STN-DBS-on and -off condition. The changes of radioligand binding did not correlate with the patients' improvement in clinical rating scales or with the stimulation amplitudes. Therefore, our PET data in living parkinsonian humans do not provide evidence for an increased striatal dopamine concentration under effective STN-DBS. We conclude that the modulation of dopaminergic activity does not seem to play a crucial role for the stimulation's mechanisms of action in parkinsonian humans. (C) 2002 Movement Disorder Society.

Affinity labels patterned in part after the potent antiepileptic (R)-N-benzyl-2-acetamido-3-methoxypropionamide ((R)-2) have been prepared as mechanistic probes to learn the pharmacological basis for FAA function. The chemical reactivity of the affinity labels with nucleophiles was assessed, and the labels were evaluated in in vitro radioligand assays and in the MES tests in rodents. The affinity labels did not bind to receptors known to effect seizure spread. Three affinity labels, (R,S)-N-benzyl-2-acetamido-6-isothiocyanatohexanamide ((R,S)-5), (R)-N-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-2-acetamido-3-methoxy-propionamide ((R)-6), and (R)-N-(3-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-2-acetamido-3-methoxy-propionamide ((R)-7), possessed excellent in vivo anticonvulsant activity and exhibited maximal activity at later time periods than typically observed for FAA. The anticonvulsant activity of 6 and 7 resided primarily in the (R)-enantiomer and the activity of (R)-6 and (R)-7 in rats (po) exceeded that of phenytoin. The chemical properties, pharmacological profile, and marked stereospecificity associated with 6 and 7 anticonvulsant activity make these compounds useful pharmacological tools for the study of the mode of action of FAA.

Dilution of the preparation to concentrations of protein less than 10 nM resulted in drastic changes of radioligand (folate) binding characteristics, i.e., a decrease in binding affinity with a change from upward to downward convex Scatchard plots and increased ligand dissociation combined with appearance of weak-affinity aggregated forms of the binding protein on gel filtration. These findings, consistent with a model predicting dimerization between unliganded and liganded monomers, were reversed in the presence of material eluted from the affinity column after adsorption of the protein( cofactor) or cholesterol, phospholipids, and synthetic detergents. The latter amphiphatic substances form micelles and lipid bilayers which could separate hydrophobic unliganded monomers from hydrophilic liganded monomers in the surrounding aqueous medium and thereby prevent association between these monomeric forms prevailing at low concentrations of the protein. Our data have some bearings on studies which show that cholesterol and phospholipids are necessary for the clustering of folate receptors in the cell membrane; a process required for optimum receptor function and internalization of folate.

All members of the family are able to inhibit the biosynthesis of juvenile hormone by corpora allata in vitro. In addition, ASTs are able to modulate the contraction of visceral muscles and may play a role in the regulation of digestive enzyme secretion by the midgut. We have identified a putative AST receptor in the cockroach midgut using a radioligand-binding assay. (125)I-Dippu-AST 7 binding to midgut membranes was specific, saturable, and reversible. The midgut appears to contain a single class of binding sites for Dippu-AST 7, with K(d) of 20.9 +/- 3.6 nM and B(max) of 1.8 +/- 0.15 pmol . mg(-1) membrane protein. The relative affinity of the 13 members of the Dippu-AST family was determined using a single-point competitive binding assay. Dippu-AST 7 and 2 appear to have higher affinity for the midgut AST receptor than Dippu-AST 5, 9, 10, or 11. Other Dippu-ASTs were unable to compete with (125)I-Dippu-AST 7 for binding, even at high concentration. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor agonists inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-α by equine monocytes	VETERINARY IMMUNOLOGY AND IMMUNOPATHOLOGY			English	Article						adenosine receptor; radioligand binding; tumor necrosis factor-alpha; lipopolysaccharide; cyclic AMP	MOUSE PERITONEAL-MACROPHAGES; TNF-ALPHA; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; EXPRESSION; RELEASE; CELLS; HORSES; INFLAMMATION; ENDOTOXEMIA; NEUTROPHILS	Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that regulates many physiological processes by activating one or more adenosine receptor subtypes, namely A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3). The results of previous studies indicate that adenosine analogues inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by equine neutrophils primarily through activation of A(2A) receptors. Because peripheral blood monocytes produce cytokines that are responsible for many of the deleterious effects of LPS, the current study was performed to evaluate the effects of an array of novel adenosine receptor agonists on LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and to assess the selectively of these agonists for equine adenosine A(2A) over the A(1) receptor. Radioligand binding studies performed with equine tissues expressing adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor subtypes yielded a rank order of affinity for the equine A(2A) receptor of ATL307 > ATL309 approximate to ATU 10 approximate to ATL313 > ATL202 approximate to ATL361 approximate to ATL376 > ATL372 > CGS21680 > NECA. Co-incubation of equine peripheral blood monocytes with LPS and these agonists resulted in inhibition of TNF-alpha production with a rank order of potency that strongly correlated with their binding affinities for equine adenosine A(2A) receptors. Results of experiments performed with one of the adenosine receptor agonists (ATL313) and selective adenosine receptor antagonists confirmed that inhibition of LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha occurred via stimulation of A(2A) receptors. Although incubation of monocytes with IB-MECA, a compound purported to act as an adenosine A(3) receptor agonist, reduced LPS-induced TNF-a production, this effect of IB-MECA was inhibited by the A(2A) selective antagonist ZM241385 but not by the A(3) receptor antagonist MRS 1220. These results indicate that the adenosine receptor subtype responsible for regulation of LPS-induced cytokine production by equine monocytes is the A(2A) receptor. To address the signal transduction mechanism responsible for the anti-inflammatory effects of ATL313 in equine monocytes, production of cAMP was compared in the presence and absence of either the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385 or the adenosine A(2B) receptor antagonist MRS1706. In the absence of the antagonists, ATL313 increased production of cAMP; ZM241385 inhibited this effect of ATL313, whereas MRS1706 did not. Furthermore, incubation of monocytes with either the stable analogue of cAMP, dibutyryl cAMP, or forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, also inhibited LPS-induced production of TNF-a production by equine monocytes. Collectively, the results of the current study indicate that adenosine analogues inhibit LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha by equine monocytes primarily via activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors and do so in a cAMP-dependent manner. The results of this study indicate that stable adenosine analogues that are selective for adenosine A(2A) receptors may be suitable for development as anti-inflammatory drugs in horses.

Therefore, the adenosine A(2B) receptor is currently in focus as a novel target for cancer therapy as well as for noninvasive molecular imaging via positron emission tomography (PET). Aiming at the development of a radiotracer labeled with the PET radionuclide fluorine-18 for imaging the adenosine A(2B) receptor in brain tumors, one of the most potent and selective antagonists, the xanthine derivative PSB-603, was selected as a lead compound. As initial biodistribution studies in mice revealed a negligible brain uptake of [H-3]PSB-603 (SUV3min: 0.2), structural modifications were performed to optimize the physicochemical properties regarding blood-brain barrier penetration. Two novel fluorinated derivatives bearing a 2-fluoropyridine (5) moiety and a 4-fluoro-piperidine (6) moiety were synthesized, and their affinity towards the four adenosine receptor subtypes was determined in competition binding assays.

Apathy in rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder s associated with serotonin depletion he dorsal raphe nucleus	BRAIN			English	Article						apathy; parkinsonism; RBD; serotonin; prodromal	PARKINSONS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; DOPAMINE; DEPRESSION; VALIDATION; DURATION; SYSTEM; SPECT	Apathy is a common and under-recognized disorder that often emerges in the prodromal phase of Parkinsonian diseases. The mechanism by which this occurs is not known, but recent evidence from patients with established Parkinson's disease suggests that serotonergic dysfunction may play a role. The integrity of the raphe serotonergic system can be assessed alongside dopaminergic basal ganglia imaging using the radioligand I-123-ioflupane, which binds both serotonin and dopamine transporters. To investigate the relative roles of these neurotransmitters in prodromal parkinsonism, we imaged patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, the majority of whom will develop a parkinsonian disorder in future. Forty-three patients underwent brain imaging with I-123-ioflupane single photon emission computed tomography and structural MRL Apathy was quantified using the Lille Apathy Rating Scale. Other clinical parkinsonian features were assessed using standard measures. A negative correlation was observed between apathy severity and, serotonergic I-123-ioflupane signal in the dorsal raphe nucleus (r = -0.55, P < 0.001). There was no significant correlation between apathy severity and basal ganglia dopaminergic signal, nor between dorsal raphe si gnal and other neuropsychiatric scores. This specific association between apathy and raphe I-123-ioflupane signal suggests that the serotonergic system might represent a target for the treatment of apathy.

Chemical modifications of 2nd generation lead structure of 3-(3-(4-(diphenylmethyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropyl)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (2, KKB16) were performed. New derivatives (4-18) were designed and synthesized. X-ray crystallographic analysis of the representative compound 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-[2-hydroxy-3-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)propyl]-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (3) was performed to support molecular modeling and SAR studies. The affinity for 5-HT7R, D2R and 5-HT1AR in radioligand binding assays for the entire series and ADME-Tox parameters in vitro for selected compounds (7, 10, and 13) were evaluated. Molecular docking and pharmacophore model assessment were performed. According to the obtained results, 5-methyl-5-naphthylhydantoin derivatives were found to be the new highly active 5-HT7R agents (K-i 5 nM) with significant selectivity over 5-HT1AR and D2R. On the contrary, the (1-naphthyl)piperazine moiety was gained with the potent dual 5-HT7R/5-HT1AR action (K-i: 11 nM/19 nM).

Impact of ageing on postsynaptic neuronal nicotinic neurotransmission in auditory thalamus	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LONDON			English	Article						aging; auditory system; cholinergic neural pathways; nicotinic receptor; thalamus	LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEI; AGE-RELATED-CHANGES; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; UP-REGULATION; RAT-BRAIN; CHOLINERGIC HYPOTHESIS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; BINDING-SITES; MESSENGER-RNA	The flow of auditory information through the medial geniculate body (MGB) is regulated, in part, by cholinergic projections from the pontomesencephalic tegmentum. The functional significance of these projections is not fully established, although they have been strongly implicated in the allocation of auditory attention. Using in vitro slice recordings, we have analysed postsynaptic function and pharmacology of neuronal nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs) in young adult and the aged rat MGB. We find that ACh produces significant excitatory postsynaptic actions on young MGB neurons, probably mediated by 2-containing heteromeric nAChRs. Radioligand binding studies show a significant age-related loss of heteromeric nAChR receptor number, which supports patch clamp data showing an age-related loss in ACh efficacy in evoking postsynaptic responses. Use of the 2-selective nAChR antagonist, dihydro--erythroidine, suggests that loss of cholinergic efficacy may also be the result of an age-related subunit switch from high affinity 2-containing nAChRs to low affinity 4-containing nAChRs, in addition to the loss of total nAChR number. This age-related nAChR dysfunction may partially underpin the attentional deficits that contribute to the loss of speech understanding in the elderly.

The mechanism by which chronic administration of antipsychotic(s) causes DSP may be the treatment-induced up-regulation of dopamine D-2 receptors (DRD2). G protein-coupled receptor kinase 6 (GRK6) and beta-arrestin 2 (ARRB2) play important roles in the trafficking of DRD2 by phosphorylation and internalization. We investigated the effects of chronic continuous treatment with mini-pump-administered haloperidol (HAL) on the sensitivity of Wistar rats to dopamine, as measured by the locomotor response to methamphetamine (MAP) and the density of striatal DRD2. Chronic continuous treatment with HAL resulted in significantly higher locomotor response to MAP and significantly higher striatal DRD2 density compared with those in rats administered vehicle (VEH). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays revealed that striatal ARRB2 in DSP model rats tended to decrease in comparison with that in the VEH group. In addition, the ratio of GRK6/ARRB2 in DSP model rats was significantly higher than that in controls. Our results suggest that alterations of the GRK6 and ARRB2 system could induce both DRD2 up-regulation and impairment of the dopamine signaling pathway, resulting potentially in the development of DSP.

Structure-Based Design of Reactive Nucleosides for Site-Specific Modification of the A<sub>2A</sub> Adenosine Receptor	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptor; nucleoside; adenosine receptor; covalent modification; affinity labeling	2ND EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; CHEMICAL-MODIFICATION; SELECTIVITY; STRATEGIES; CHEMISTRY; EFFICACY; COVALENT; BINDING	Adenosine receptors (ARs) are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily and have shown much promise as therapeutic targets. We have used an agonist-bound A(2A)AR X-ray crystallographic structure to design a chemically reactive agonist for site-specific chemical modification of the receptor. To further explore and chemically engineer its binding cavity, a 2-nitrophenyl active ester was attached through an elongated chain at adenine C2 position. This general structure was designed for irreversible transfer of a terminal acyl group to a nucleophilic amino group on the A(2A)AR. Preincubation with several O-acyl derivatives prevented radioligand binding that was not regenerated upon extensive washing. In silico receptor docking suggested two lysine residues (second extracellular loop) as potential target sites for an O-acetyl derivative (MRS5854, <bold>3a</bold>), and site-directed mutagenesis indicated that K153 but not K150 is essential. Similarly, a butyl azide for click reaction was incorporated in the active ester moiety (<bold>3b</bold>). These promising results indicate a stable, covalent modification of the receptor by several reactive adenosine derivatives, which could be chemical tools for future imaging, structural probing, and drug discovery. Thus, structure-based ligand design has guided the site-specific modification of a GPCR.	[Moss, Steven M.; Jayasekara, P.

Selective introduction of the kappa pharmacophoric structural elements pyrrolidine and 3,4-dichlorophenylacetamide with a two-carbon distance afforded conformationally restricted kappa agonists 13-15 based on the quinoxaline ring system. In competitive radioligand receptor binding studies the benzylamine 13b, the secondary amine 14b, and the carbamate 15 displayed high kappa receptor affinity. The K-1 value of the lead compound derived methoxycarbonyl derivative 15 is 9.7 nM. However, the x affinity of 15 is exceeded by 13b and 14b with a basic functional group instead of the methoxycarbonyl group in 1-position of the quinoxaline system. The chlorine atoms of the dichlorophenylacetyl residue are essential, since the corresponding phenylacetyl analogs show considerably reduced x affinity. The potent kappa ligands 13b, 14b and 15 are selective over the related mu- and delta-opioid receptors, sigma(1), sigma(2) and NMDA receptors.

Molecular probes for the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptor based on a pyrazolo[4,3-<i>e</i>][1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-<i>c</i>]pyrimidin-5-amine scaffold	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						SCH 442416; G protein-coupled receptor; Fluorescence; Dendrimer; Radioligand binding	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; RAT-BRAIN; ANTAGONISTS; DERIVATIVES; POTENT; DEPRESSION; DISCOVERY; TARGETS; MODELS	Pyrazolo[4,3-e][1,2,4] triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidin-5-amine derivatives such as SCH 442416 display high affinity and selectivity as antagonists for the human A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR). We extended ether-linked chain substituents at the p-position of the phenyl group using optimized O-alkylation. The conjugates included an ester, carboxylic acid and amines (for amide condensation), an alkyne (for click chemistry), a fluoropropyl group (for F-18 incorporation), and fluorophore reporter groups (e. g., BODIPY conjugate 14, K-i 15 nM). The potent and A(2A)AR-selective N-aminoethylacetamide 7 and N-[2-(2-aminoethyl)-aminoethyl]acetamide 8 congeners were coupled to polyamidoamine (PAMAM) G3.5 dendrimers, and the multivalent conjugates displayed high A(2A)AR affinity. Theoretical docking of an AlexaFluor conjugate to the receptor X-ray structure highlighted the key interactions between the heterocyclic core and the binding pocket of the A(2A)AR as well as the distal anchoring of the fluorophore. In conclusion, we have synthesized a family of high affinity functionalized congeners as pharmacological probes for studying the A(2A)AR. Published by Elsevier Ltd.	[Kumar, T.

Brain serotonin transporter binding in non-depressed patients with Parkinson's disease	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROLOGY			English	Article						depression; Parkinson's disease; serotonin; serotonin transporter	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HEALTHY HUMANS; IN-VITRO; PET; DISORDER; VIVO; DEPRESSION; CITALOPRAM; OCCUPANCY; PROTEIN	Early post-mortem data suggest that damage to brain serotonin neurones might play a role in some features (e.g., depression) of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is not known whether such damage is a typical characteristic of living patients with PD or whether the changes are regionally widespread. To address this question we measured, by positron emission tomography imaging, levels of the brain serotonin transporter (SERT), a marker for serotonin neurones, as inferred from binding of [C-11]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile (DASB), a second generation SERT radioligand, in subcortical and cerebral cortical brain areas of clinically advanced non-depressed (confirmed by structured psychiatric interview) patients with PD. SERT binding levels in PD were lower than those in controls in all examined brain areas, with the changes statistically significant in orbitofrontal cortex (-22%), caudate (-30%), putamen (-26%), and midbrain (-29%). However, only a slight non-significant reduction (-7%) was observed in dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex, an area implicated in major depression. Our imaging data suggests that a modest, regionally widespread loss of brain serotonergic innervation might be a common feature of advanced PD. Further investigation will be required to establish whether SERT binding is more or less decreased in those patients with PD who also have major depressive disorder.

Semen contains a high concentration of Zn2+, which is known to inhibit the protease activity of PSA. We characterized the binding of Zn2+ to SgI and SgII and found evidence that these proteins are involved in regulating the activity of PSA. Intact SgI and SgII and synthetic semenogelin peptides were used in the experiments. Binding of Zn2+ was studied by radioligand blotting, titration with a zinc (II) fluorophore chelator and NMR analysis. A chromogenic substrate was used to measure the enzymatic activity of PSA. SgI and SgII bound Zn2+ with a stoichiometry of at least 10 cool (mol of protein)(-1) and with an average dissociation constant of approx. 5 mu M per site. Moreover, Zn2+-inhibited PSA was activated by exposure to SgI or SgII. Since both proteins have high affinity for Zn2+ and are the dominating proteins in semen, they probably represent the major Zn2+ binders in semen, one function of which may be to regulate the activity of PSA. The system is self-regulating, and PSA is maintained in an active state by its substrate.

Carbon/silicon exchange (sila-substitution) at the 4-position of the piperidine ring of la (R3COH --> R3SiOH) leads to sila-haloperidol (1b). Sila-haloperidol was synthesized in a multistep synthesis, starting from tetramethoxysilane, and was isolated as the hydrochloride 1b(.)HCl. ESI-MS studies of aqueous solutions of the silanol 1b and the corresponding disiloxane 10 at different pH values revealed a remarkable stability of 1b. The C/Si analogues 1a(.)HCl and 1b(.)HCl were structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and solution ([D-6]DMSO) NMR spectroscopy. Analogous chair conformations of the piperidinium (1a(.)HCl) and 4-silapiperidinium (1b(.)HCl) skeleton were observed in the crystal, and two analogous chair conformations of the cations were detected in solution, the molar ratios of these two conformers differing substantially (1a(.)HCl, 13:1; 1b-HCl, 2:1). In radioligand binding studies, the C/Si analogues la and 1b displayed similar potencies at recombinant human dopamine hD(1), hD(4), and hD(5) receptors, whereas the silicon compound 1b was 4.7-fold more potent at hD(2) receptors than its carbon analogue 1a; i.e., sila-substitution of haloperidol has changed the receptor selectivity profile.

This compound was labeled by [C-11]methylation of a corresponding desmethyl precursor (DAA1123) with [C-11]CH3I in the presence of NaH, with a 72+/-16% (corrected for decay) incorporation yield of radioactivity. After HPLC purification, [C-11]DAA1106 was obtained with 98% radiochemical purity and specific activity of 90-156 GBq/mumol at the end of synthesis. After iv injection of [C-11]DAA1106 into mice, high accumulations of radioactivity were found in the olfactory bulb and cerebellum, the high PBR density regions in the brain. Coinjection of [C-11]DAA1106 with unlabeled DAA1106 and PBR-selective PK11195 displayed a significant reduction of radioactivity, suggesting a high specific binding of [C-11]DAA1106 to PBR. Although this tracer was rapidly metabolized in the plasma, only [C-11]DAA1106 was detected in the brain tissues, suggesting the specific binding in the brain due to the tracer itself. These findings revealed that [C-11]DAA1106 is a potential and selective positron emitting radioligand for PBR. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Immunohistochemical analysis of carcinomas revealed a strong vitronectin accumulation in extracellular matrix (ECM) around some cancer cell clusters and in the subendothelial area of some blood vessels. In normal tissue, vitronectin had a homogeneous periductal occurrence, with local accumulation much lower than that in the carcinomas. Using a new solid phase radioligand assay, the vitronectin concentrations of extracts of carcinomas and normal breast tissue were determined and found to be indistinguishable. Comparison of the vitronectin and the hemoglobin concentrations of the extracts showed that their vitronectin content was not derived from blood contamination. Vitronectin mRNA was undetectable in both carcinomas and normal tissue. We conclude that vitronectin is not synthesised locally in breast tissue but derived by leakage from vessels, followed by extracellular accumulation in patterns distinctly different in carcinomas and normal tissue. The observation of a high vilronectin content in the carcinomas and its localisation in the tissue contributes to the clarification of the role of vitronectin in tumour biology in interaction with the plasminogen activation system and integrins.

MUC1 has adhesive and immunosuppressive properties, which may promote cancer progression. These studies evaluated the effect of IFNs on MUC1 expression, since these agents are widely used in clinical cancer therapy. MUC1 and interferon (IFN) receptor expression were measured by radioligand binding. Changes in MUC1 mRNA levels in response to IFN-gamma were assessed by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IFN-gamma was found to be a more potent inducer of MUC1 expression than IFN-alpha. I-125-IFN binding studies indicated that both IFN receptors were expressed in most of the cell lines. With IFN-gamma treatment, there was upregulation of MUC1 mRNA. IFN-gamma has a more consistent and more potent effect upon MUC1 induction than IFN-alpha. The ability to upregulate MUC1 across a broad range of cancer types by a clinically available cytokine, IFN-gamma, has important implications for enhancing immunotherapeutic approaches targeting MUC1.

A cocaine analogue, [3H]CFT (WIN 35,428, 2 beta -carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane) was used as a radioligand to determine the number of [3H]CFT binding sites (Bmax) and their dissociation constant (Kd). In patients with AD the reduction in [3H]CFT binding in the putamen was about 50% compared to age-matched controls. In the caudate nucleus the reduction was about 33%. Thus, the putamen was more severely affected. No change was observed in Kd values between AD patients and controls. Brain samples from 37 healthy controls (aged from 8 to 91 years) were used to study the changes in striatal [3H]CFT binding with increasing age. The Bmax of [3H]CF-F uptake was reduced both in the putamen and in the caudate nucleus. The average decline per decade was greater in the caudate nucleus (7.3%) than in the putamen (5.5%). In conclusion, the pattern of changes in AD is different from that seen during normal ageing, which seems to affect more severely the caudate nucleus than the putamen.

In the present study, we synthesized 25 novel xanthine derivatives with variable substituents at the N1-, N3- and C8-position as adenosine receptor antagonists with potential anti-inflammatory activity. The compounds were investigated in radioligand binding studies at all four human adenosine receptor subtypes, A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3). Compounds showing nanomolar A(2A) and dual A1/A(2A) affinities were obtained. Three compounds, 19, 22 and 24, were selected for further studies. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies indicated binding poses and interactions within the orthosteric site of adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors. In vitro studies confirmed the high metabolic stability of the compounds, and the absence of toxicity at concentrations of up to 12.5 mu M in various cell lines (SH-SY5Y, HepG2 and BV2). Compounds 19 and 22 showed anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. In vivo studies in mice investigating carrageenan- and formalin-induced inflammation identified compound 24 as the most potent anti-inflammatory derivative. Future studies are warranted to further optimize the compounds and to explore their therapeutic potential in neurodegenerative diseases.

There is a notable gap in the market for novel NMDAR antagonists, however current methods to analyse potential antagonists rely on indirect measurements of calcium flux and hazardous radioligand binding assays. Recently, a fluorescent NMDAR ligand, N-adamantan-1-yl-dimethylamino-1-naphthalenesulfonic acid, known as AM-DAN was developed by our group. Additional studies on this ligand is necessary to evaluate its potential as a biological tool in NMDAR research. Therefore, this study was aimed at conducting structural analyses, fluorescence experiments, high-accuracy NMDAR molecular modelling and NMDAR phencyclidine (PCP) site competition binding studies using AM-DAN. Results revealed that AM-DAN has appropriate structural properties, significant fluorescent ability in various solvents and is able to bind selectively and compete for the PCP-binding site of the NMDAR. Therefore, AM-DAN holds promise as a novel fluorescent ligand to measure the affinity of prospective drugs binding at the NMDAR PCP-site and may circumvent the use of radioligands.

This study tested the hypothesis that individual variation in dopamine and corticosteroid physiology in wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus, n = 15) would significantly predict behaviour and weight loss in response to a long-term stressor, captivity. We found that individuals that coped better with captivity (fewer anxiety-related behaviours, more time spent feeding, higher body mass) had lower baseline and higher stress-induced corticosteroid titres at capture. Birds with higher striatal D-2 receptor binding (examined using positron emission tomography (PET) with C-11-raclopride 24 h post-capture) spent more time feeding in captivity, but weighed less, than birds with lower D-2 receptor binding. In the subset of individuals imaged a second time, D-2 receptor binding decreased in captivity in moulting birds, and larger D-2 decreases were associated with increased anxiety behaviours 2 and 4 weeks post-capture. This suggests changes in dopaminergic systems could be one physiological mechanism underlying negative behavioural effects of chronic stress. Non-invasive technologies like PET have the potential to transform our understanding of links between individual variation in physiology and behaviour and elucidate which neuroendocrine phenotypes predict stress resilience, a question with important implications for both humans and wildlife.

We decided to determine if the response to such drugs may be altered, because of changes in the levels of muscarinic receptors in the CNS from subjects with the disorder. We used in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography to measure the levels of [H-3]pirenzepine binding to muscarinic M1 receptors, [H-3]AF-DX 386 binding to muscarinic M1, M2, and M4 receptors, and [H-3]4-DAMP binding to muscarinic M1 and M3 receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus from subjects with Alzheimer's and age/sex-matched controls. Compared with controls, [H-3]pirenzepine binding was higher in the dentate gyrus from subjects with Alzheimer's disease. [H-3]AF-DX 386 binding was higher in the subiculum and parahippocampal gyrus from subjects with the disorder. In Alzheimer's disease, [H-3]-DAMP binding was higher in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but not different in the hippocampus. Our data show complex changes in the levels of muscarinic receptors in the CNS from subjects with Alzheimer's disease which may affect clinical response to treatment with drugs-targeting these receptors.

The present study examined the effect of prolonged opioid treatment on cerebral 5-HT2A receptors. Cerebral 5-HT2A receptor availability was estimated in seven healthy five-year-old female neutered Beagle dogs pre and post 10-day morphine treatment (oral sustained release morphine 20 mg twice daily for 10 days) with I-123-R-91150, a 5-HT2A selective radioligand, and SPEC. 5-HT2A receptor binding indices (BI) for the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital cortex and the subcortical region were calculated. Statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed-effect model with treatment as fixed effect and dog as random effect. Morphine treatment significantly (P <= 0.05) lowered 5-HT2A Bls in the right and left frontal cortex, the right and left temporal cortex, the right and left parietal cortex, and the subcortical region. The decreased cerebral 5-HT2A receptor availability following prolonged morphine exposure provides further evidence for an interaction between the opioid and serotonergic system.

As one of our efforts to discover a new type of 5-HT7 receptor antagonists, we here report on the synthesis and binding affinities to the 5-HT7 receptor of the quinazolinone library 1, which was designed with various substituents (X, Y, R-1, and R-2) on the aromatic rinas and different carbon chain length. Total 85 compounds of the quinazolinone library 1 were synthesized and the binding affinities of all the synthesized compounds were obtained by radioligand binding assay for the 5-HT7 receptor. Among the 85 compounds, 24 compounds show very good binding affinities with IC50 values below 100 nM. Mainly the compounds with IC50 values below 100 nM have o-OMe or o-OEt as R-2 substituent. The compound with the best binding affinity is 1-68 of which the IC50 value is 12 nM. In in vivo animal study, some synthesized compounds really have the antidepressant activity in the forced swimming test in mice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The F-loop of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor γ<sub>2</sub> subunit contributes to benzodiazepine modulation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GABA(A) RECEPTOR; STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS; NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; AGONIST-BINDING; A RECEPTORS; CHANNEL; RESIDUES; SITE; MUTAGENESIS; SUBUNIT	GABA(A) receptors can be modulated by benzodiazepines, although these compounds do not directly activate or inhibit the receptors. The prototypic benzodiazepine, diazepam, potentiates responses to GABA in GABAA receptors that contain a gamma subunit. Here we have used mutagenesis, radioligand binding, voltage clamp electrophysiology, and homology modeling to probe the role of the F-loop residues Asp(192)-Arg(197) in the GABAA receptor gamma(2) subunit in diazepam potentiation of the GABA response. Substitution of all of these residues with Ala and/or a residue with similar chemical properties to the wild type residue decreased the level of diazepam potentiation, and one mutation (D192A) resulted in its complete ablation. None of the mutations changed the GABA EC50 or the [H-3] flumazenil binding affinity, suggesting they do not affect GABA or benzodiazepine binding characteristics; we therefore propose that they are involved in the diazepam-mediated conformational change that results in an increased response to GABA. Homology models of the receptor binding pocket in agonist-bound and unbound states suggest that the F-loop is flexible and has different orientations in the two states. Considering our data in relation to these models, we find that the F-loop residues could contribute to hydrogen bond networks and hydrophobic interactions with neighboring residues that change during receptor activation.

With respect to improved stability, detection of receptor subtypes in cells and tissues, and prevention of receptor internalization, small nonpeptidic fluorescent 1 antagonists should be superior. Here we present a set of four fluorescent nonpeptide NPY Y, receptor (Y,R) antagonists. The highest affinity was obtained by labelling an N-G-(6-aminohexanoyl)argininamide derived from the Y1R antagonist BIBP 3226, with Py-1, a small pyrylium dye. The fluorescent pyridinium-type Y,R antogonist, compound 4 had K, values of 29 nM and 2.7 nM, which were determined by radioligand binding and flow cytometry under equilibrium conditions, respectively; 4 had a K-b value of 0.6 nM (Ca2+ assay). The large Stoke's shift (547 vs. 615 nm) in buffer (PBS, pH 7.4) in the presence of 1% BSA and the red emission (quantum yield 56 %) are advantageous with respect to the signal-to-noise ratio. The new probe was successfully used in fluorescence-based binding experiments evaluated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy; this demonstrates the potential of pyrylium dyes for the preparation of fluorescent ligands that are applicable for the study of G protein-coupled receptors on, living cells.

Proteochemometric analysis of small cyclic peptides' interaction with wild-type and chimeric melanocortin receptors	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						proteochemometrics; G-protein coupled receptors; multipart chimeric receptors; melanocortin receptors; HS peptides; recognition site; selectivity	STIMULATING-HORMONE RECEPTOR; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; LEAST-SQUARES REGRESSION; AGOUTI-RELATED PROTEIN; MOLECULAR-CLONING; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; LIGAND-BINDING; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONIST	The melanocortin (MC) system confines unique G-protein coupled receptor pathways, which include the MC1-5 receptors and their endogenous agonists and antagonists, the MCs and the agouti and agouti-irelated proteins. The MC4 receptor is an important target for development of drugs for treatment of obesity and cachexia. While natural MC peptides are selective for the MC, receptor, some cyclic pentapeptides, such as the HS-129 peptide, show high selectivity for the MC4 receptor. Here we gained insight into the mechanisms for its recognition by MC receptors. To this end we correlated the interaction data of four HS peptide analogues with four wild-type and 14 multiple chimeric MC receptors to the binary and physicochemical descriptions of the studied entities by use of partial least squares regression, which resulted in highly valid proteochemometric models. Analysis of the models revealed that the recognition sites of the HS peptides are different from the earlier proteochemometrically mapped linear MSH peptides' recognitions sites, although they overlap partially. The analysis also revealed important amino acids that explain the selectivity of the HS-129 peptide for the MC4 receptor.

This double substitution led to a new series of opioid peptides displaying subnanomolar delta antagonist activity and mu agonist or antagonist properties depending on the configuration of the beta-MeCha residue. The most promising analog, H-Dmt-Tic-(2S,3S)-beta-MeCha-Phe-OH was a very selective delta antagonist both in the mouse vas deferens (MVD) assay (K-e = 0.241 +/- 0.05 nM) and in radioligand binding assay (K-i(delta) = 0.48 +/- 0.05 nM, K-i(mu)/K-i(delta) = 2800). The epimeric peptide H-Dmt-Tic-(2S,3R)-beta-MeCha-Phe-OH and the corresponding peptide amide turned out to be mixed partial mu agonist/delta antagonists in the guinea pig ileum and MVD assays. Our results constitute further examples of the influence of Dmt and beta-methyl substitution as well as C-terminal amidation on the potency, selectivity, and signal transduction properties of TIPP related peptides. Some of these compounds represent valuable pharmacological tools for opioid research.

In saturation studies (n = 18), binding of [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzylate (QNB) was of high affinity (K-d 87.3 pM) and capacity (B-max 362 +/- 27 fmol/mg protein), with no differences between ascending and sigmoid colon. Kinetic studies gave a K-d of 55 pM. Methoctramine and darifenacin displayed biphasic binding profiles, the high affinity components being compatible with a population of approximately 80 +/- 5% M-2 and 13 +/- 2% M-3 muscarinic receptors, respectively. Pirenzepine, mamba toxin 1 and mamba toxin 3 were very weak competitors, indicating negligible expression of muscarinic M-1 and M-4 receptors. Six other subtype-preferring antagonists exhibited K-i values typical of those reported at cloned human muscarinic M-2 receptors. In the presence of methoctramine, pre-treatment with alkylating agent 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-(2-chloroethyl)-piperidine hydrochloride (4-DAMP mustard) inhibited [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzylate binding to 26% of sites. Following alkylation of muscarinic M-3 receptors, darifenacin bound to a single low affinity site, indicating binding to muscarinic M-2 receptors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In pulmonary A549 cells, TNF-alpha or interleukin-1beta dramatically increased bradykinin B-1 and B-2 receptor mRNA expression and this response was prevented by dexamethasone. In primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bradykinin B-1 receptor mRNA expression showed a similar trend, whereas bradykinin B-2 receptor showed almost constitutive expression. Radioligand-binding studies revealed significant increases in bradykinin B-1 receptor protein expression following both interleukin-1beta and TNF-alpha treatment of A549 cells; however, no evidence was found for bradykinin B-1 receptor. Functionally, the bradykinin B-2 receptor ligand, bradykinin, but not the B-1 ligand, des-Arg(10)-kallidin, produced a marked increase in prostaglandin E-2 release when administered following interleukin-1beta treatment. Arachidonic acid release in response to bradykinin was markedly enhanced by prior incubation with interleukin-1beta and this was prevented by the prior addition of dexamethasone.

Recurrent ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) of the skin results in pressure ulcer formation, a major clinical problem. ATL-146e was evaluated in a novel reproducible rat model of pressure ulcer. A 9-cm(2) region of dorsal rat skin was cyclically compressed at 50 mmHg using a surgically implanted metal plate and an overlying magnet to generate reproducible tissue necrosis. Osmotic minipumps were implanted into 24 rats divided into four equal groups to infuse vehicle (control), ATL-146e (0.004 mug . kg(-1) . min(-1)), ATL-146e plus an equimolar concentration of A(2A) antagonist, ZM-241385, or ZM-241385 alone. Each group received 10 I/R cycles. In non-I/R-treated skin, ATL-146e has no effect on blood flow. I/R-treated skin of the ATL-146e group compared with the vehicle group had 65% less necrotic area, 31% less inhibition of average skin blood flow, and fewer extravasated leukocytes (23 +/- 3 vs. 49 +/- 6 per 500 mum(2)). These data suggest that ATL-146e, acting via an A(2A)-AR, reduces leukocyte infiltration and is a potent prophylactic for I/R injury in skin.

Various assay formats are currently applied to screen large compound libraries for agonists or antagonists, However, the development of nonradioactive, miniaturizable assays that are compatible with the requirements of ultra-high throughput screening (uHTS) has so far been slow, In this report we describe homogeneous fluorescence-based binding assays that are highly amenable to miniaturization. Fluorescence intensity distribution analysis (FIDA) is a single-molecule detection method that is sensitive to brightness changes of individual particles, such as those induced by binding of fluorescent ligands to membrane particles with multiple receptor sites, As a confocal detection technology, FIDA inherently allows reduction of the assay volume to the microliter range and below without any loss of signal, Binding and displacement experiments are demonstrated for various types of GPCRs, such as chemokine, peptide hormone, or small-molecule ligand receptors, demonstrating the broad applicability of this method, The results correlate quantitatively with radioligand binding data, We compare FIDA with fluorescence anisotropy (FA), which is based on changes of molecular rotation rates upon binding of fluorescent ligands to membranes, While FA requires a higher degree of binding, FIDA is sensitive down to lower levels of receptor expression, Both methods are, within these boundary conditions, applicable to uHTS.

[I-123]L750,667, labeled by iododestannylation, was administered to baboons in bolus and bolus plus constant infusion paradigms and imaged for 6 h. Total [I-123]L750,667 brain uptake peaked (2.3% injected dose) at 15 min postinjection. [I-123]L750,667 uptake was observed in all brain regions measured including diencephalon, brainstem, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex, and cerebellum, and slightly lower levels were noted in the frontal, parietal, temporoinsular, and occipital cortices. Administration of the D-4 receptor antagonist NGD 94-1 (2 mg/kg) did not displace radioactivity from any of the brain regions examined. Thus, while L750,667 is selective for the D-4 receptor in vitro, because brain [I-123]L750,667 uptake was not displaced by NGD 94-1 at receptor saturating doses, [I-123]L750,667 does not appear to be a suitable radiotracer for in vivo imaging of the D-4 receptor.

Post-therapy whole-body (WB) dosimetry and Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT data were compared and related to progression free and overall survival. Results Lu-177-PSMA-617 dosimetry after the first cycle indicated high tumor doses for skeletal (4.01 +/- 2.64; range 1.10-13.00 Gy/GBq), lymph node (3.12 +/- 2.07; range 0.70-8.70 Gy/GBq), and liver (2.97 +/- 1.38; range 0.76-5.00 Gy/GBq) metastases whereas the dose for tissues/organs was acceptable in all patients for an intention-to-treat activity of 24 GBq. Any PSA decrease after the first cycle was found in 23/32 (72%), after the second cycle in 22/32 (69%), after the third cycle in 16/28 (57%), and after the fourth cycle in 8/18 (44%) patients. Post-therapy 24 h WB scintigraphy showed decreased tumor-to-background ratios in 24/32 (75%) after the first therapy cycle, after the second cycle in 17/29 (59%), and after the third cycle in 13/21 (62%) patients. The median PFS was 7 months and the median OS 12 months. In the group of PSA responders (n = 22) the median OS was 17 months versus 11 months in the group of non-responders (n = 10), p < 0.05. Decreasing SUVmax values were found for parotid (15.93 +/- 6.23 versus 12.33 +/- 4.07) and submandibular glands (17.65 +/- 7.34 versus 13.12 +/- 4.62) following treatment, along with transient (n = 6) or permanent (n = 2) xerostomia in 8/32 (25%) patients. In 3/32 patients, nephrotoxicity changed from Grade 2 to 3, whereas neither Grade 4 nephrotoxicity nor hematotoxicity was found. In most patients a good agreement was observed for the visual interpretation of the tracer accumulation between 24 h WB and PET/CT scans. However, no significance could be calculated for baseline-absorbed tumor doses and SUVmax values of tumor lesions. 5/32 (16%) patients showed a mixed response pattern, which resulted in disease progression over time. Conclusion Serial PSA measurements and post-therapy 24 h WB scintigraphy seems to allow a sufficiently accurate follow-up of Lu-177-PSMA-617-treated mCRPC patients whereas Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT should be performed for patient selection and final response assessment.

The amplified glutamate signals may arise from enhanced glutamatergic circuits, which can be affected by astrocyte activation and suppressive signaling of dopamine neurotransmission. We tested this hypothesis using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and positron emission tomography scan with C-11-SCH23390 for dopamine D1 receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We enrolled 18 male adults with high-functioning autism and 20 typically developed (TD) male subjects. The autism group showed elevated glutamate, glutamine, and myo-inositol (mI) levels compared with the TD group (p = 0.045, p = 0.044, p = 0.030, respectively) and a positive correlation between glutamine and mI levels in the ACC (r = 0.54, p = 0.020). In autism and TD groups, ACC D1 receptor radioligand binding was negatively correlated with ACC glutamine levels (r = - 0.55, p = 0.022; r = - 0.58, p = 0.008, respectively). The enhanced glutamate-glutamine metabolism might be due to astroglial activation and the consequent reinforcement of glutamine synthesis in autistic brains. Glutamine synthesis could underly the physiological inhibitory control of dopaminergic D1 receptor signals. Our findings suggest a high neuron excitation-inhibition ratio with astrocytic activation in the etiology of autism.

Peptides from the Sea Anemone <i>Metridium senile</i> with Modified Inhibitor Cystine Knot (ICK) Fold Inhibit Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors	TOXINS			English	Article						sea anemone venom; Metridium senile; ICK fold peptides; nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; NMR structure; electrophysiology; radioligand assay	CONOTOXIN; CNIDARIA; CHANNEL; TOXINS; NOMENCLATURE; MODULATION; ACTINIARIA; NUDIBRANCH; PREDATION; PROTEINS	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in the functioning of the central and peripheral nervous systems, and other organs of living creatures. There are several subtypes of nAChRs, and almost all of them are considered as pharmacological targets in different pathological states. The crude venom of the sea anemone Metridium senile showed the ability to interact with nAChRs. Four novel peptides (Ms11a-1-Ms11a-4) with nAChR binding activity were isolated. These peptides stabilized by three disulfide bridges have no noticeable homology with any known peptides. Ms11a-1-Ms11a-4 showed different binding activity towards the muscle-type nAChR from the Torpedo californica ray. The study of functional activity and selectivity for the most potent peptide (Ms11a-3) revealed the highest antagonism towards the heterologous rat alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR compared to the muscle and alpha 7 receptors. Structural NMR analysis of two toxins (Ms11a-2 and Ms11a-3) showed that they belong to a new variant of the inhibitor cystine knot (ICK) fold but have a prolonged loop between the fifth and sixth cysteine residues. Peptides Ms11a-1-Ms11a-4 could represent new pharmacological tools since they have structures different from other known nAChRs inhibitors.	[Kasheverov, Igor E. E.; Logashina, Yulia A.

Intranasal administration of CPG (1 and 2 mg/kg, 2 weeks) to BALB/c mice in the Porsolt test resulted in a significant antidepressant-like effect more potent than that from intraperitoneal administration of CPG. At the same time, intranasal administration of CPG to C57BL/6 mice in the tail-suspension test was the same as that upon intraperitoneal administration and led to a moderate antidepressant-like effect (1 mg/kg, 4 weeks). Intranasal CPG did not produce any effect on anxiety or exploratory activity in the closed cross-maze test. Radioligand analyses showed an increased density of GABA(A) receptors in the PFC (1 mg/kg) and reduced density of NMDAand 5HT(2A) receptors in the hippocampus and striatum, respectively, after intranasal administration of CPG (1 and 2 mg/kg) for two weeks while not affecting mGluII receptor binding in the hippocampus. The significant difference in hippocampal NMDA binding between the two routes may indicate that this receptor is involved in the mechanism of the antidepressant-like effect of CPG.	[Abdullina, A.

Label-free high-throughput screening assay for the identification of norepinephrine transporter (NET/SLC6A2) inhibitors	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; BINDING-KINETICS; LIVING CELLS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; NORADRENALINE; RADIOLIGAND; VALIDATION; SEROTONIN; MECHANISM; RECEPTOR	The human norepinephrine transporter (NET) is an established drug target for a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Conventional methods that are used to functionally characterize NET inhibitors are based on the use of radiolabeled or fluorescent substrates. These methods are highly informative, but pose limitations to either high-throughput screening (HTS) adaptation or physiologically accurate representation of the endogenous uptake events. Recently, we developed a label-free functional assay based on the activation of G protein-coupled receptors by a transported substrate, termed the TRACT assay. In this study, the TRACT assay technology was applied to NET expressed in a doxycycline-inducible HEK 293 JumpIn cell line. Three endogenous substrates of NET-norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and epinephrine (EP)-were compared in the characterization of the reference NET inhibitor nisoxetine. The resulting assay, using NE as a substrate, was validated in a manual HTS set-up with a Z ' =0.55. The inhibitory potencies of several reported NET inhibitors from the TRACT assay showed positive correlation with those from an established fluorescent substrate uptake assay. These findings demonstrate the suitability of the TRACT assay for HTS characterization and screening of NET inhibitors and provide a basis for investigation of other solute carrier transporters with label-free biosensors.

This coupling of action and valence is often thought of as a Pavlovian bias, although recent research has shown it may also emerge through instrumental mechanisms. We measured this learning bias with a rewarded go/no-go task in 60 adults of different ages. Using computational modeling, we characterized the bias as being instrumental. To assess the role of endogenous dopamine (DA) in the expression of this bias, we quantified DA D1 receptor availability using positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand [C-11]SCH23390. Using principal-component analysis on the binding potentials in a number of cortical and striatal regions of interest, we demonstrated that cortical, dorsal striatal, and ventral striatal areas provide independent sources of variance in DA D1 receptor availability. Interindividual variation in the dorsal striatel component was related to the strength of the instrumental bias during learning. These data suggest at least three anatomical sources of variance in DA D1 receptor availability separable using PET in humans, and we provide evidence that human dorsal striatal DA D1 receptors are involved in the modulation of instrumental learning biases.

Pharmacologists were always, and in many ways still are, bound to study drugs in systems they do not fully understand. Under these circumstances, null methods were the main ways in which conclusions about biologically active molecules were made. However, as understanding of the basic mechanisms of cellular function and biochemical systems were elucidated, so too did the understanding of how drugs affected these systems. Over the past 20 years, new ideas have emerged in the field that have completely changed and revitalized it; these are described herein. It will be seen how null methods in isolated tissues gave way to, first biochemical radioligand binding studies, and then to a wide array of functional assay technologies that can measure the effects of molecules on drug targets. In addition, the introduction of molecular dynamics, the appreciation of the allosteric nature of receptors, protein X-ray crystal structures, genetic manipulations in the form of knock-out and knock-in systems and Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs have revolutionized pharmacology.

However, published data on the striatal DA transporter (DAT) appear less consistent with this hypothesis, probably partly due to methodological limitations. Moreover, DAT in extrastriatal regions has been very poorly investigated in the context of schizophrenia. In order to address these issues, we used a high resolution positron emission tomograph and the selective DAT radioligand [C-11]PE2I, coupled with a whole brain voxel-based analysis method to investigate DAT availability in striatal but also extra-striatal regions in 21 male chronic schizophrenia patients compared to 30 healthy male controls matched by age. We found higher DAT availability in schizophrenia patients in midbrain, striatal, and limbic regions. DAT availability in amygdala/hippocampus and putamen/pallidum was positively correlated with hallucinations and suspiciousness/persecution, respectively. These results are consistent with an increase of presynaptic DA function in patients with schizophrenia, and support the involvement of both striatal and extrastriatal DA dysfunction in positive psychotic symptoms. The study also highlights the whole brain voxel-based analysis method to explore DA dysfunction in schizophrenia.

X-ray crystal structures of AChBP in complex with alpha-conotoxins provide important insights into the interactions of alpha-conotoxins with distinct nAChR subtypes. Although considerable efforts have been made to understand why alpha-conotoxin GIC is strongly selective for alpha 3 beta 2 nAChR, this question has not yet been solved. Here we present the structure of alpha-conotoxin GIC in complex with Aplysia californica AChBP (Ac-AChBP) at a resolution of 2.1 angstrom. Based on this co-crystal structure complemented with molecular docking data, we suggest the key residues of GIC in determining its high affinity and selectivity for human alpha 3 beta 2 vs alpha 3 beta 2 nAChRs. These suggestions were checked by radioligand and electrophysiology experiments, which confirmed the functional role of detected contacts for GIC interactions with Ac-AChBP and alpha 3 beta 2 nAChR subtypes. While GIC elements responsible for its high affinity binding with Ac-AChBP and alpha 3 beta 2 nAChR were identified, our study also showed the limitations of computer modelling in extending the data from the X-ray structures of the AChBP complexes to all nAChR subtypes.

This study measured nAChR availability, as determined by SPECT imaging, on and off selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in first episode depressed patients. Methods: Five patients in their first episode of major depressive disorder (MDD) on a single SSRI underwent [I-123]5-I-A85380- SPECT neuroimaging prior to stopping their medication and again 6 weeks following medication cessation. Autoradiography of post mortem brain tissue with [I-125]5-I-A85380 in the presence or absence of flour commonly prescribed antidepressants was also assessed. Results: SSRI antidepressants did not affect the relative binding availability of alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors for the [I-123]5-I-A85380 ligand in vivo. Radioligand binding in vitro was unaffected by a single, high pharmacological concentration of antidepressants. Conclusion: SPECT imaging studies using [I-123]5-I-A85380 to measure alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR availability in depressed patients are unlikely to be confounded to a major degree by concurrent antidepressant medication.

In vitro binding carried out in tissue homogenates prepared from postmortem AD brains with [(125)[] IMPY (6-iodo-2-(40-dimethylamino-phenyl-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine) as the radioligand indicated good binding affinities (K-i = 4.0 and 1.5 nM for 8 and 14, respectively). Brain penetration of the corresponding radiofluorinated ligands, evaluated in the normal mice, showed good initial brain penetration (4.50 and 2.43% ID/g (injected dose/gram) for [F-18]8 and [F-18]14 at 2 min after injection) with moderate to low washout rates from the brain (1.71% ID/g at 2h and 2.10% ID/g at 3 h, respectively). Autoradiography and homogenate binding studies demonstrated the high specific binding of [F-18]14 to the Ab plaques; however, [F-18]8 showed low specific binding. These preliminary results identified that indolylphenylacetylene, 14, may be a good lead for further structural modi. cation to develop a useful Ab plaque imaging agent. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

There is, however, considerable lack of human data directly demonstrating this association in vivo. Here, we assessed the relationship between the distribution of the major inhibitory serotonergic neurotransmitter receptor, the 5-HT1A subtype, and the functional organization within early visual cortex defined by retinotopic mapping. The 5-HT1A receptor-binding potential was quantified by positron emission tomography (PET) using the highly selective and specific radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in seven healthy subjects. The retinotopic maps and borders determined by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) were compared to the receptor distribution employing surface-based region of interest analysis in each of these subjects. We found a significant difference in receptor-binding potential in the functionally defined primary (V1) compared to secondary (V2) visual area, as V1 exhibits only 68% of receptor binding found in V2 in both hemispheres, which is consistent with postmortem data. Our in vivo findings clearly support prior assumptions of a link between receptor distribution and functional fields of the human cortex. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Purification and characterization of the guinea pig sigma-1 receptor functionally expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>	PROTEIN EXPRESSION AND PURIFICATION			English	Article						maltose binding protein; sigma receptor; pentazocine; methamphetamine; protein purification	MALTOSE-BINDING PROTEIN; KNOCKOUT MICE; RAT-LIVER; SITES; CELLS; MICRODOMAINS; INVOLVEMENT; CHANNELS; DYNAMICS; LIGANDS	Sigma receptors once considered as a class of opioid receptors are now regarded as unique orphan receptors, distinguished by the ability to bind various pharmacological agents such as the progesterone (steroid), haloperidol (anti-psychotic), and drugs of abuse such as cocaine and methamphetamine. The sigma-1 receptor is a 223 amino acid protein, proposed to have two transmembrane segments. We have developed a scheme for the purification of the guinea pig sigma-1 receptor following overexpression in Escherichia coli as a maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion and extraction with Triton X-100. Affinity chromatography using an amylose column and Ni2+ affinity column was used to purify the sigma-1 receptor. The sigma-1 receptor purified by this method is a 26kDa polypeptide as assessed by SDS-PAGE, binds sigma ligands with high affinity and can be specifically photoaffinity labeled with the sigma-1 receptor photoprobe, [I-125]-iodoazidococaine. Ligand binding using [H-3]-(+)-pentazocine indicated that approximately half of the purified protein in Triton X-100 bound to radioligand. The MBP-sigma-1 receptor and the sigma-1 receptor in 0.5% triton were maximally stable for approximately two weeks at -20 degrees C in buffer containing 30% glycerol. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Striatal delta opioid receptor binding in experimental models of Parkinson's disease and dyskinesia	MOVEMENT DISORDERS			English	Article						opioid receptor; MPTP; dyskinesia; macaque; Parkinson's disease	MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; LESIONED PRIMATE MODEL; L-DOPA; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; GENE-EXPRESSION; RAT-BRAIN; SUBSTANCE-P; RESERPINE TREATMENT	Enhanced delta opioid receptor transmission may represent an endogenous compensatory mechanism in parkinsonism to reduce the activity of the indirect striatopallidal pathway following dopamine depletion. Furthermore, increased delta opioid receptor transmission may be causative in the production of dyskinesia following repeated dopaminergic treatment in Parkinson's disease. The present study employed radioligand receptor autoradiography, using [H-3]naltrindole, a ligand selective for the delta opioid receptor, to assess delta opioid receptor binding sites in forebrain regions of reserpine-treated rats, and in parkinsonian nondyskinetic, and dyskinetic MPTP-lesioned macaques. In reserpine-treated animals, specific delta opioid binding was increased in premotor cortex (+30%), sensorimotor striatum (+20%), and associative striatum (+17%) rostrally, but was not changed in caudal forebrain. In contrast, delta opioid receptor binding was not significantly altered at any region analyzed, in either nondyskinetic or dyskinetic, MPTP-lesioned macaques, compared to normal. These results suggest that transient changes in delta opioid receptor binding may occur in motor circuits following acute dopamine depletion. However, in the more chronic MPTP-lesioned macaque model, simple changes in delta opioid receptor number or affinity are unlikely to contribute to mechanisms for abnormal opioid transmission in Parkinson's disease and dyskinesia.

EC72 was produced by coupling folic acid-gamma-cysteine to 7-N-modified MMC via a disulfide bond. This water soluble conjugate was found to retain high affinity for FR-positive cells, and it produced dose responsive activity in vitro against a panel of folate receptor (FR)-positive cell lines. EC72's activity was considered to be targeted and specific for the FR since W excess folic acid blocked biological activity, and (ii) FR-negative cell lines were unresponsive to this drug. Initial in vivo tests confirmed EC72's activity in both syngeneic and xenograft models, and this activity occurred in the apparent absence of gross or pathological toxicity. These results are significant, since daily dosing of EC72 for more than 30 consecutive days yielded no evidence of myelosuppression or toxicity to major organs, including the FR-positive kidneys. The latter observation supports published data, indicating that the apically oriented kidney proximal tubule FRs function to salvage folates prior to their excretion and to return these molecules back into systemic circulation. Overall, EC72's performance in vitro and in vivo warrants further preclinical study before this novel targeted chemotherapeutic is considered for clinical investigation.

The radioligand [C-11]beta-CIT-FE was used to determine DAT binding in caudate and putamen. Results showed clear age-related losses of striatal DAT binding from early to late adulthood, and a marked deterioration in episodic memory (word and figure recall, face recognition) and executive functioning (visual working memory, verbal fluency) with advancing age. Most importantly, the age-related cognitive deficits were mediated by reductions in DAT binding, whereas DAT binding added systematic cognitive variance after controlling for age. Further, interindividual differences in DAT binding were related to performance in a test of crystallized intelligence (the Information subtest from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised) that showed no reliable age variation. These results suggest that DAT binding is a powerful mediator of age-related cognitive changes as well as of cognitive functioning in general. The findings were discussed relative to the view that the frontostriatal network is critically involved in multiple cognitive functions. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated the effect of metoclopramide on the contraction, phosphatidylinositol response, and binding affinity of muscarinic M-3 receptors in rat trachea preparations. Male Wistar rats were anesthetized and their tracheas excised and chopped into 3-mm-wide rings, 1-mm-wide slices, or frozen 10-mum-thick sections. Contraction was induced with 0.55 muM carbachol (CCh) and, 30 min later, metoclopramide (10 muM to 1 mM) was added. The slices were incubated with (3)[H]myoinositol, 0.55 muM CCh, and metoclopramide, and the formation of (3)[H] inositol monophosphate was measured. A radioligand binding study was conducted to examine the effects of metoclopramide using [H-3] 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methobromide (4-DAMP), a muscarinic M-3 receptor antagonist, in sections of the trachea. Metoclopramide concentration dependently attenuated CCh-induced contraction and inositol monophosphate accumulation, and also attenuated the binding affinity of 4-DAMP to muscarinic M-3 receptors. The 50% inhibitory concentration of metoclopramide against the binding affinity of 4-DAMP to muscarinic M-3 receptors of rat trachea was 24 muM. These findings suggest that the attenuation by metoclopramide of CCh-induced contraction and phosphatidylinositol. response may be mediated through the muscarinic M-3 receptors.

Eight patients with early PD without antiparkinsonian medication and 7 healthy volunteers were investigated with [F-18]CFT positron emission tomography (PET). The PET scan was carried out twice at an approximate 2-year interval. The uptake of [F-18]CFT was calculated as a region-cerebellum:cerebellum ratio at 180 to 210 minutes after injection. At the first PET scan, the [F-18]CFT uptake in PD patients in the putamen was 1.45 +/- 0.45 (mean +/- SD) (42% of the control mean) and 2.43 +/- 0.59 in the caudate nucleus (76% of the control mean). The ratios declined by the time of the second PET scan, and the rate of annual decline of the baseline mean in PD patients was 13.1% in the putamen and 12.5% in the caudate nucleus. In controls, the corresponding figures were 2.1% for the putamen and 2.9% for the caudate nucleus. The decline in [F-18]CFT uptake was significantly higher in PD patients than in controls. Thus, dopamine transporter ligands such as [F-18]CFT seem to be sensitive markers for the rate of progression in PD.

High expression of PSMA is essential for successful PSMA-RLT. However, some patients develop [F-18]FDG-avid lesions with low or no PSMA expression ([F-18]FDG/[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 mismatch findings on PET/CT) in the course of treatment. Those lesions are not affected by PSMA-RLT and a change in therapy management is needed. To enable early mismatch detection, possible blood parameters as indicators for the occurrence of [F-18]FDG/[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 mismatch findings on PET/CT were evaluated. Methods Retrospective study of N = 66 advanced mCRPC patients with dual [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 and [F-18]FDG PET/CT imaging within 4 weeks, who were referred for or received [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were tested as indicators for the occurrence of [F-18]FDG/[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 mismatch findings. Additional to absolute values, relative changes (Delta PSA, Delta NSE, Delta GGT, Delta ALP) over a period of 4 +/- 1 weeks prior to [F-18]FDG PET/CT were analyzed. Results In total, 41/66 (62%) patients revealed at least one [F-18]FDG/[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 mismatch finding on PET/CT. These mismatch findings were detected in 13/41 (32%) patients by screening for and in 28/41 (68%) patients during PSMA-RLT. NSE serum level (55.4 +/- 44.6 mu g/l vs. 18.5 +/- 8 mu g/l, p < 0.001) and Delta NSE (93.8 +/- 124.5% vs. 2.9 +/- 39.5%, p < 0.001) were significantly higher in the mismatch group than in the non-mismatch group. No significant differences were found for serum PSA (p = 0.424), Delta PSA (p = 0.417), serum ALP (p = 0.937), Delta ALP (p = 0.611), serum GGT (p = 0.773), and Delta GGT (p = 0.971). For NSE and Delta NSE, the maximum value of the Youden index in ROC analysis was at a cut-off level of 26.8 mu g/l (sensitivity 78%, specificity 96%) and at + 13.9% (sensitivity 84%, specificity 75%), respectively. An introduced scoring system of both parameters achieved a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 88% for the occurrence of [F-18]FDG/[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 mismatch. Conclusion We observed a significantly higher absolute serum concentration and a higher relative increase of NSE in advanced mCRPC patients with [F-18]FDG-avid and insufficient PSMA expressing metastases ([F-18]FDG/[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 mismatch findings on PET/CT) in our cohort. NSE might be used as a potential laboratory indicator for [F-18]FDG/[Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 mismatch findings, if this observation is confirmed in future, ideally prospective, studies in larger patient cohorts.

MINocyclinE to Reduce inflammation and blood brain barrier leakage in small Vessel diseAse (MINERVA) trial study protocol	EUROPEAN STROKE JOURNAL			English	Article						Stroke; small vessel disease; arteriosclerosis; neuroinflammation; bloodbrain barrier; clinical trial; experimental medicine	WHITE; DEGRADATION	Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common cause of stroke and cognitive impairment. Recent data has implicated neuroinflammation and increased blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability in its pathogenesis, but whether such processes are causal and can be therapeutically modified is uncertain. In a rodent model of SVD, minocycline was associated with reduced white matter lesions, inflammation and BBB permeability. Aims: To determine whether blood-brain barrier permeability (measured using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI) and microglial activation (measured by positron emission tomography using the radioligand C-11-PK11195) can be modified in SVD. Design: Phase II randomised double blind, placebo-controlled trial of minocycline 100 mg twice daily for 3 months in 44 participants with moderate to severe SVD defined as a clinical lacunar stroke and confluent white matter hyperintensities. Outcomes: Primary outcome measures are volume and intensity of focal increases of blood-brain barrier permeability and microglial activation determined using PET-MRI imaging. Secondary outcome measures include inflammatory biomarkers in serum, and change in conventional MRI markers and cognitive performance over 1 year follow up. Discussion: The MINERVA trial aims to test whether minocycline can influence novel pathological processes thought to be involved in SVD progression, and will provide insights into whether central nervous system inflammation in SVD can be therapeutically modulated.

Development of a non-radiometric method for measuring the arterial input function of a <SUP>11</SUP>C-labeled PET radiotracer	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; F-18	Positron emission tomography (PET) uses radiotracers to quantify important biochemical parameters in human subjects. A radiotracer arterial input function (AIF) is often essential for converting brain PET data into robust output measures. For radiotracers labeled with carbon-11 (t(1/2)=20.4 min), AIF is routinely determined with radio-HPLC of blood sampled frequently during the PET experiment. There has been no alternative to this logistically demanding method, neither for regular use nor validation. A C-11-labeled tracer is always accompanied by a large excess of non-radioactive tracer known as carrier. In principle, AIF might be obtained by measuring the molar activity (A(m); ratio of radioactivity to total mass; Bq/mol) of a radiotracer dose and the time-course of carrier concentration in plasma after radiotracer injection. Here, we implement this principle in a new method for determining AIF, as shown by using [C-11]PBR28 as a representative tracer. The method uses liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for measuring radiotracer A(m) and then the carrier in plasma sampled regularly over the course of a PET experiment. A(m) and AIF were determined radiometrically for comparison. The new non-radiometric method is not constrained by the short half-life of carbon-11 and is an attractive alternative to conventional AIF measurement.	[Shetty, H.

In radioligand binding studies, GR64349 displaced [I-125]-NKA binding to NK2 receptors with high affinity (pKi 7.77 +/- 0.10) but only weakly displaced [H-3]-septide binding to NK1 receptors (pKi < 5). In functional studies examining increases in intracellular inositol-1 phosphate (IP-1) accumulation, calcium levels, and cyclic AMP synthesis, GR64349 was a full agonist by reference to the endogenous agonists NKA (NK2 receptors) and substance P (NK1 receptors). GR64349 increased IP-1 accumulation with 1,400-fold greater potency in cells expressing NK2 receptors (pEC(50) 9.10 + 0.16) than cells expressing NK1 receptors (pEC(50) 5.95 +/- 0.80). For calcium responses, GR64349 was 500-fold more potent in the assay using NK2 receptors (pEC(50) 9.27 +/- 0.26) than NK1 receptors (pEC(50) 6.55 +/- 0.16). GR64349 also stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis in both cell lines, and was almost 900-fold more potent at NK2 receptors (pEC(50) 10.66 +/- 0.27) than NK1 receptors (pEC(50) 7.71 +/- 0.41). These findings confirm that GR64349 is the most selective NK2 receptor agonist described to date.

M1 muscarinic receptor is a key target of neuroprotection, neuroregeneration and memory recovery by i-Extract from <i>Withania somnifera</i>	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE PATHOLOGY; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; AMYLOID PATHOLOGY; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; GOLDILOCKS ZONE; SPATIAL MEMORY; GENE FAMILY; ASHWAGANDHA; EXPRESSION; PROTEIN	Memory loss is one of the most tragic symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. Our laboratory has recently demonstrated that 'i-Extract' of Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) restores memory loss in scopolamine (SC)-induced mice. The prime target of i-Extract is obscure. We hypothesize that i-Extract may primarily target muscarinic subtype acetylcholine receptors that regulate memory processes. The present study elucidates key target(s) of i-Extract via cellular, biochemical, and molecular techniques in a relevant amnesia mouse model and primary hippocampal neuronal cultures. Wild type Swiss albino mice were fed i-Extract, and hippocampal cells from naive mice were treated with i-Extract, followed by muscarinic antagonist (dicyclomine) and agonist (pilocarpine) treatments. We measured dendritic formation and growth by immunocytochemistry, kallikrein 8 (KLK8) mRNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and levels of KLK8 and microtubule-associated protein 2, c isoform (MAP2c) proteins by western blotting. We performed muscarinic receptor radioligand binding. i-Extract stimulated an increase in dendrite growth markers, KLK8 and MAP2. Scopolamine-mediated reduction was significantly reversed by i-Extract in mouse cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Our study identified muscarinic receptor as a key target of i-Extract, providing mechanistic evidence for its clinical application in neurodegenerative cognitive disorders.

H3 receptors are expressed in neocortical areas, including the prefrontal cortex, the key region of cognitive functions such as working memory. However, the role of prefrontal H-3 receptors in working memory has not yet been clarified. Therefore, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) techniques, we aimed to investigate the association between the neural activity of working memory and the density of H-3 receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Findings: Ten healthy volunteers underwent both fMRI and PET scans. The N-back task was used to assess the neural activities related to working memory. H-3 receptor density was measured with the selective PET radioligand [C-11] TASP457. The neural activity of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during the performance of the N-back task was negatively correlated with the density of H-3 receptors in this region. Conclusions: Higher neural activity of working memory was associated with lower H-3 receptor density in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This finding elucidates the role of H-3 receptors in working memory and indicates the potential of H-3 receptors as a therapeutic target for the cognitive impairments associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

AQPs are highly expressed in malignant astrocytomas, and a positive correlation is observed between their expression levels and histological tumor grade. OBJECTIVE: To examine the utility of aquaporin positron emission tomography (PET) for differentiating between astrocytoma grade III and grade IV using the AQP radioligand [C-11] TGN-020. METHODS: Fifteen astrocytoma patients, grade III (n = 7) and grade IV (n = 8), and 10 healthy volunteers underwent [C-11] TGN-020 aquaporin PET imaging. Surgical tissues of astrocytoma patients were examined for histopathological grading using the WHO classification standard and expression of AQP1 and AQP4 immunohistochemically. RESULTS: Mean standardized uptake values of astrocytoma grade III and IV (0.51 +/- 0.11 vs 1.50 +/- 0.44, respectively) were higher than normal white matter (0.17 +/- 0.02, P <.001) for both tumor grades. Importantly, mean standardized uptake values of astrocytoma grade IV were significantly higher than grade III (P <.01). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that [C-11] TGN-020 aquaporin PET imaging differentiated between astrocytoma grades III and IV. We suggest its clinical application as a noninvasive diagnostic tool would lead to advancements in the management of these malignant brain tumors.

The authors tested norepinephrine transporter availability in patients with major depressive disorder with the aim to identify any associations between test results and clinical symptoms. Method: The present research was a cross-sectional study in which 19 patients with major depressive disorder and 19 age-and sex-matched healthy comparison subjects underwent positron emission tomography scanning to evaluate the norepinephrine transporter availability measured by the radioligand (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2. Norepinephrine transporter availability in the thalamus and its subregions was quantified in terms of nondisptaceable binding potential (BPND). The authors also analyzed the association between norepinephrine transporter availability and clinical symptoms. Results: Compared with healthy subjects, patients with major depressive disorder showed 29.0% higher BPND values in the thalamus and, in particular, 28.2% higher values in the thalamic subregion anatomically connected to the prefrontal cortex. Elevated norepinephrine transporter availability in the thalamus in patients was positively correlated with attention, as measured by the Trail Making Test, part A. Conclusions: These findings revealed altered norepinephrine transmission in patients with major depressive disorder, suggesting that this alteration could be related to attention in this patient population.

Design, synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and molecular dynamics of β-amino acids morphan-derivatives as novel ligands for opioid receptors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Morphans; Molecular dynamics; beta-amino acids; Radioligand binding; mu opioid receptor	FORCE-FIELD; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; ASYMMETRIC-SYNTHESIS; BINDING; PROTEINS; DENSITY; MODEL; SIMULATIONS; CONSTRAINTS; ANTAGONIST	Structure-Activity Relationship (SAR) is a current approach in the design of new pharmacological agents. We previously reported the synthesis of a novel analogue of morphine, a 2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane, which contains a beta-amino acid. This bicyclic core exhibits two distinctive chemical handles for further elaboration, which allowed us to create a library of morphan-containing compounds by in silico molecular docking on the mu opioid receptor. Lead candidates were synthesized and biological tests were performed to evaluate their ability to bind to opioid receptors. The four top compounds, three phenyl esters and an N-phenylethyl morphan derivative, were selected for Molecular Dynamics simulations to get topological and thermodynamic information. Aromatic morphan derivatives displayed an interacting domain which fits into a hydrophobic cleft and the effect of the substituents in their affinity was explained by the differences in the calculated binding free energies. Our results indicate that the 3D arrangement of the aromatic ring in the morphine derivatives is not a key issue for a specific ligand - mu receptor interaction. Thus, these morphan derivatives represent a new class of opioid receptor ligands which may be of great use in the clinical practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Dual Targeting of Adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> Receptors and Monoamine Oxidase B by 4<i>H</i>-3,1-Benzothiazin-4-ones	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; POTENTIAL TREATMENT; INHIBITORS; MAO; ALZHEIMERS; DRUG; LIGANDS; BINDING	Blockade of A(2A) adenosine receptors (A(2A)ARs) and inhibition of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) in the brain are considered attractive strategies for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). In the present study, benzothiazinones, e.g., 2-(3-chlorophenoxy)-N-(4-oxo-4H-3,1-benzothiazin-2-yl)acetamide (13), were identified as a novel class of potent MAO-B inhibitors (IC50 human MAO-B: 1.63 nM). Benzothiazinones with large substituents in the 2-position, e.g., methoxycinnamoylamino, phenylbutyrylamino, or chlorobenzylpiperazinylbenzamido residues (14, 17, 27, and 28), showed high affinity and selectivity for A(2A)ARs (K-i human A(2A)AR: 39.5-69.5 nM). By optimizing benzothiazinones for both targets, the first potent, dual-acting A(2A)AR/MAO-B inhibitors with a nonxanthine structure were developed. The best derivative was N-(4-oxo-4H-3,1-benzothiazin-2-yl)-4-phenylbutanamide (17, K-i human A(2A), 39.5 nM; IC50 human MAO-B, 34.9 nM; selective versus other AR subtypes and MAO-A), which inhibited A(2A)AR-induced cAMP accumulation and showed competitive, reversible MAO-B inhibition. The new compounds may be useful tools for validating the A(2A)AR/MAO-B dual target approach in PD.

We hypothesized that the DVR value for SERT binding would be lower in depressed versus non-depressed subjects. [I-123]-ADAM SPECT scans were acquired from 20 drug free, depressed subjects and 20 drug-free depressed subjects and 10 drug-free healthy volunteers. The primary outcome measure was the DVR value for [I-123]-ADAM uptake in the midbrain, medial temporal lobe, and basal ganglia regions. Depressed subjects demonstrated significantly lower DVR values in the midbrain, right and left medial temporal lobe, and right and left basal ganglia. There was significant probability that lower DVR values could distinguish between depressed and non-depressed subjects in the midbrain, medial temporal lobe, and the right and left basal ganglia. These findings confirm prior observations of lower SERT binding in depression, and suggest that low SERT binding may represent a putative biomarker of depression. Future studies are needed to confirm these observations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

As the CB2R has a very low brain expression in non-pathological conditions, but is upregulated in activated microglia, it is an interesting target for visualization of neuroinflammation using positron emission tomography with a suitable radiolabeled CB2R ligand. In this study, we radiolabelled a fluoroethyl derivative of GW405833, a well known CB2R partial agonist, with fluorine-18 (half-life 109.8 min) by alkylation of the phenol precursor with 1-bromo-2-[F-18] fluoroethane. In vitro studies showed that FE-GW405833 behaved as a selective high affinity (27 nM) inverse agonist for hCB(2)R. [F-18] FE-GW405833 showed moderate initial brain uptake in mice and rats, but a slow washout from brain and plasma due to retention of a radiometabolite. Specific binding of the tracer to human CB2R was demonstrated in vivo in a rat model with local CB2R overexpression in the brain. Optimized derivatives of GW405833 that are less susceptible to metabolism will need to be developed in order to provide a useful tracer for CB2R quantification with PET. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Serotonin transporter affinity of (-)-loliolide, a monoterpene lactone from <i>Mondia whitei</i>	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						[H-3]-citalopram; Depression; Loliolide; Mondia whitei; Radioligand binding assay; Serotonin transporter	LOLIOLIDE; PLANTS; CONSTITUENTS; MEDICINE; DRUGS	Mondia whitei (Apocynaceae) is used in traditional medicine to treat nervous disorders. Previous studies have shown in vivo antidepressant-like activity in the forced swimming test and affinity to the serotonin transporter of an ethanolic leaf extract of M. whitei. The aim of this study was to isolate the compound(s) responsible for in-vitro serotonin transporter affinity in M. whitei. Bioassay guided isolation lead to the identification of the monoterpene lactone (-)-loliolide. An ethanol extract was prepared from dry leaves. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate, extracted with water by liquid liquid partitioning. This was followed by VLC fractionation. Through HPLC-UV separation the active compound was isolated and characterized by GC-MS, LC-MS and H-1-NMR. The activity of (-)-loliolide was tested in a serotonin transporter binding assay using [H-3]citalopram as ligand, giving an IC50-value of 997 mu M, corresponding to a K-i-value of 409 mu M. Loliolide is a non-nitrogenous compound and might bind to the transporter in a different way to nitrogen-containing inhibitors. The results provide a rationale for the use of M. whitei in the treatment of depression and other central nervous system diseases in traditional medicine. (C) 2010 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Quantitation of estrogen receptors and relaxin binding in human anterior cruciate ligament fibroblasts	IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-ANIMAL			English	Article						flow cytometry; gender; estrogen receptor; relaxin; anterior eruciate ligament; binding	MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; SERUM RELAXIN; JOINT LAXITY; CELLULAR-METABOLISM; INJURY PATTERNS; TEAM HANDBALL; SEX-HORMONES; KNEE; PREGNANCY; WOMEN	The significantly higher incidence of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries in collegiate women compared with men may result from relative ligament laxity. Differences in estrogen and relaxin activity, similar to that seen in pregnancy, may account for this. We quantified estrogen receptors by flow cytometry and relaxin receptors by radioligand binding assay in human ACL cells and compared the presence of these receptors in males and females. ACL stumps were harvested from seven males and eight females with acute ACL injuries. The tissue was placed in M199 cell culture medium. Outgrowth cultures were obtained, and passage 2 cells were used for all studies. Estrogen receptor determination was performed using flow cytometry. Relaxin binding was performed in ACL cells derived from five female and male patients using I-125-labeled relaxin. Estrogen receptors were identified by flow eytometry in 4 to 10% of ACL cells. Mean fluorescence of cells expressing estrogen receptors was approximately twice that of controls, with no significant differences between males and females. Relaxin studies showed low-level binding of I-125,-relaxin-labeled ACL cells. Relaxin binding was present in four out of five female ACL cells versus one out of five male ACL cells.

The free hydroxy groups at the 2' and 3' positions of the agonists 2-chloro-N-6-(3-iodobenzyl)-9-(N-methyl-(beta-D-ribosfuranosyluronamide)adenine 2b, the corresponding 4'-thio nucleoside 2c, and antagonists 4a and 4b (5'-N,N-dimethylamides related to 2b and 2c, respectively) were derivatized through simple acylation reactions. The prodrug derivatives were tested in radioligand binding assays at ARs and in a functional assay of adenylate cyclase at the A(3)AR and found to be considerably less active than the parent drugs. The hydrolysis of nucleoside 2',3'-diesters to regenerate the parent compound in the presence of human blood was demonstrated. 2',3'-Dipropionate esters of 2b and 4a were readily cleaved in a two-step reaction to regenerate the parent drug, on a time scale of two hours. The cleavage of a 2',3'-dihexanoate ester occurred at a slower rate. This indicates that the prodrugs are suitable as masked forms of the biologically active A(3)AR agonists and antagonists for future evaluation in vivo.

This method, however, suffers from a noise-dependent bias. Approaches for reducing this bias include incorporating a presmoothing step, minimizing the squared perpendicular distance to the regression line, and conducting multilinear analysis. The solution proposed by Ogden, likelihood estimation in graphical analysis (LEGA), is an estimation technique in the original (nontransformed) domain based upon standard likelihood theory that incorporates the specific assumptions made on the noise inherent in the measurements. To determine the impact of this new method upon the noise-dependent bias, we compared V-T determinations by compartmental modeling, graphical analysis (GA), and LEGA in 36 regions of interest in dynamic PET data from 25 healthy volunteers injected with [C-11]-WAY-100635 and [C-11]-McN-5652, which are agents used to image the serotonin 1A receptor and serotonin transporter, respectively. As predicted by simulations, LEGA eliminates the noise-dependent bias associated with GA using OLS. This method is a valuable addition to the tools available for the quantification of radioligand binding data in PET and SPECT.

However, due to technical limitations in the isolation and culture of bronchial endothelial cells, most studies of lung vascular permeability have focused on pulmonary endothelium. Thus conditions for culture of sheep bronchial artery endothelial cells (BAEC) and bronchial microvascular endothelial cells (BMVEC) were established. The bronchial artery and the mainstem bronchi, stripped of epithelium, were dissected, and endothelial cells were isolated by enzymatic treatment. BAEC and BMVEC demonstrated positive staining for factor VIII-related antigen, 1,1'-dioctadecyl- 3,3,3', 3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate-labeled low-density lipoprotein, and PECAM-1. Radioligand binding studies confirmed equivalent numbers of bradykinin B-2 receptors on BAEC and BMVEC. Permeability of BAEC and BMVEC was determined after treatment with bradykinin and thrombin by comparing the translocation of FITC-dextran (mol wt 9,500) across confluent monolayers (n=10-12). Bradykinin caused a maximal increase in permeability in BAEC (165% increase) and BMVEC (144% increase) by 15 min compared with vehicle controls. Thrombin treatment altered BMVEC permeability only, reaching a maximal response at 60 min (109% increase). These results demonstrate bronchial endothelial cell heterogeneity and establish methods to determine intracellular mechanisms contributing to airway disease in relevant cell systems.

This point is critical for the correct conversion of the estimated binding constants to meaningful units. We simulated sets of receptor assays which considered distinct experimental situations, and fitted the data with two models considering either a unique or two different affinities for the two classes of ligand. We compared direct non-linear regression, linear robust regression on transformed data, and an experimental approach called pseudo-saturation (labeled plus unlabeled ligand in constant ratio) assay. It emerges from the results that none of these methods would be sensitive enough, even in commonly acceptable error levels in the measured variables, to indicate the appropriate model with a reasonable certainty. The a priori consideration of a different binding capacity for both categories of the ligand gives an acceptable estimation of the parameters, regardless of the fact that the fitting criteria reflect a better fitting of the other model. We conclude that a two-affinity binding model should be routinely fitted to experimental data and the binding constants compared to the simple binding model when the specific activity of the radiotracer needs to be assessed.

However, in vitro studies of the effect of monoamine oxidase inhibitors on imidazoline I-2-site radioligand binding have produced conflicting findings. Using the technique of autoradiography, we examined the effect of in vivo administration of the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor tranylcypromine on binding of the imidazoline I-2 site-specific ligand [H-3]2-(-2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline ([H-3]2-BFI) in four rat brain nuclei which are known to possess a high density of imidazoline I-2 sites, together with cerebral cortex and cerebellum which show weaker binding. A single acute pre-treatment with tranylcypromine significantly increased imidazoline I-2, site-specific binding in four regions: arcuate nucleus, interpeduncular nucleus, pineal gland and area postrema, but effects in cortical areas and cerebellum were not significant. The extent of the increase was proportional to the control binding in each region. In contrast, five daily treatments with the same dose of tranylcypromine significantly reduced [H-3]2-BFI binding in these same areas. The potential role of monoamine oxidase isoforms in these changes is discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we assessed DAT standardized uptake values (SUV) of F-18-FECNT in the striatum and cerebellum of 20 heroin-dependent subjects and 10 healthy controls and analyzed the correlation between DAT availability and heroin withdrawal symptom scores and anxiety/depression rating scales in heroin-dependent subjects, as well as the relationship between the withdrawal symptoms scores and age. The striatal DAT availability in heroin-dependent subjects was significantly lower (by similar to 15.7-17.6%) than that in healthy controls. Age was positively related to heroin withdrawal symptom scores. The withdrawal symptom scores in older patients (Age: 49.5 +/- 2.5) were significantly higher (by similar to 20%) than those in younger patients (Age: 30.9 +/- 4.8). These results confirm that chronic heroin use induces striatal DAT reduction, suggesting that F-18-FECNT could be used as an alternative PET imaging radioligand for in vivo imaging of DAT in drug addicted subjects. Moreover, older patients might suffer more severe withdrawal symptoms than younger patients, suggesting that older patients with heroin withdrawal could be given more medication.

Hypo-glycosylated human follicle-stimulating hormone (hFSH<SUP>21/18</SUP>) is much more active <i>in vitro</i> than fully-glycosylated hFSH (hFSH<SUP>24</SUP>)	MOLECULAR AND CELLULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						FSH isoforms; Oligosaccharide; FSHR	HUMAN MENSTRUAL-CYCLE; GLYCOPROTEIN HORMONES; RECEPTOR-BINDING; ALPHA-SUBUNIT; FSH ISOFORMS; BETA-SUBUNIT; BIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; CARBOHYDRATE RESIDUES; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; LUTROPIN	Hypo-glycosylated hFSH(21/18) (possesses FSH beta(21) and FSH beta(18)bands) was isolated from hLH preparations by immunoaffinity chromatography followed by gel filtration. Fully-glycosylated hFSH(24) was prepared by combining the fully-glycosylated FSH beta(24) variant with hCG alpha and isolating the heterodimer. The hFSH(21/18) glycoform preparation was significantly smaller than the hFSH(24) preparation and possessed 60% oligomannose glycans, which is unusual for hFSH. Hypo-glycosylated hFSH(21/18) was 9- to 26-fold more active than fully-glycosylated hFSH24 in FSH radioligand assays. Significantly greater binding of I-125-hFSH(21/18) tracer than hFSH(24) tracer was observed in all competitive binding assays. In addition, higher binding of hFSH(21/) (18) was noted in association and saturation binding assays, in which twice as much hFSH(21/18) was bound as hFSH(24). This suggests that more ligand binding sites are available to hFSH(21/18) in FSHR than to hFSH(24). Hypo-glycosylated hFSH(21/18) also bound rat FSHRs more rapidly, exhibiting almost no lag in binding, whereas hFSH(24) specific binding proceeded very slowly for almost the first hour of incubation.

It was our aim to study the effect of A beta on multiple components of the glutamatergic system, and therefore we assessed the expression of several glutamate-related proteins and amino acids in the TgSwDI mouse model for A beta pathology. We determined that in TgSwDI mice, levels of several amino acids are altered, in particular that of glycine. Protein changes were only found in 9-month-old TgSwDI mice with extensive A beta deposits, with the most prominent change an increased expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1). Autoradiography experiments demonstrated that, while the number of activated N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors was unchanged in TgSwDI mice, binding of the NMDA receptor radioligand [H-3]MDL-105,519 to the glycine-binding site of these receptors was increased. Although there are some discrepancies between our results and those found in AD patients, our results suggest that several components of the glutamatergic system might serve as meaningful markers to monitor the progression of AD.

In the present study, we demonstrate that heteromerization of adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)Rs) and A(2A) receptors (A(2A)Rs) allows adenosine to exert a fine-tuning modulation of glutamatergic neurotransmission. By means of coimmunoprecipitation, bioluminescence and time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer techniques, we showed the existence of A(1)R-A(2A)R heteromers in the cell surface of cotransfected cells. Immunogold detection and coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that A(1)R and A(2A)R are colocalized in the same striatal glutamatergic nerve terminals. Radioligand-binding experiments in cotransfected cells and rat striatum showed that a main biochemical characteristic of the A(1)R-A(2A)R heteromer is the ability of A(2A)R activation to reduce the affinity of the A(1)R for agonists. This provides a switch mechanism by which low and high concentrations of adenosine inhibit and stimulate, respectively, glutamate release. Furthermore, it is also shown that A(1)R-A(2A)R heteromers constitute a unique target for caffeine and that chronic caffeine treatment leads to modifications in the function of the A(1)R-A(2A)R heteromer that could underlie the strong tolerance to the psychomotor effects of caffeine.

The illicit use of GHB precursors and analogs reportedly has increased worldwide. Gamma-hydroxyvaleric (GHV) is a 4-methyl- substituted analog of GHB that reportedly is abused and is marketed as a dietary supplement and replacement for GHB. The purpose of these studies was to compare the pharmacological and behavioral profiles of GHV and GHB. In radioligand binding studies, GHV completely displaced [H-3]NCS-382 with approximately 2-fold lower affinity than GHB and did not markedly displace [3 H]GABA from GABA(B) receptors at a 20-fold larger concentration. In drug discrimination procedures, GHV did not share discriminative stimulus effects with GHB or baclofen. GHV shared other behavioral effects with GHB, such as sedation, catalepsy, and ataxia, although larger doses of GHV were required to produce these effects. Lethality (50%) was observed after the largest dose of GHV (5600 mg/kg), a dose that produced less-than-maximal catalepsy and ataxia. To the extent that large doses of GHV might be taken to in an attempt to produce GHB-like effects (e.g., hypnosis) GHV toxicity may pose a greater public health concern than GHB.

The pharmacological and functional profiles of human NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were compared by determining the affinity of several peptides derived from both NPFF precursors and by measuring their abilities to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Each NPFF receptor recognizes peptides from both precursors with nanomolar affinities, however, with a slight preference of pro-NPFFA peptides for NPFF2 receptors and of pro-NPFFB peptides for NPFF1 receptors. BIBP3226 ((R)-N-2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[(4-hydroxyphenyl)-methyl]-argininamide) and BIBO3304 ((R)-N-2-(diphenylacetyl)-N-[4-(aminocarbonylaminomethyl)-benzyl]-argininamide trifluoroacetate), two selective neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y, receptor antagonists, display relative high affinities for NPFF receptors and exhibit antagonist properties towards hNPFF(1) receptors. The structural determinants responsible for binding of these molecules to NPFF receptors were investigated and led to the synthesis of hNPFF(1) receptor antagonists with affinities from 40 to 80 nM. Our results demonstrate differences in pharmacological characteristics between NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptors and the feasibility of subtype-selective antagonists. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Using this quaternary ammonium derivative of QNB, labelled with carbon-11, a positron-emitting isotope (half-life : 20.4 minutes), the potential for quantification of myocardial muscarinic receptors in vivo using the high-resolution, sensitive and quantitative imaging technique PET (positron emission tomography) was previously demonstrated in dogs and validated in humans. In this paper, the radiosynthesis of carbon-11-labelled Me-QNB is investigated and oriented towards the preparation of multi milliCuries of radiotracer. Typically, using no-carrier-added [C-11]methyl triflate as the alkylating agent and 0.64 mg (1.89 mu mol) of QNB as precursor for labelling at 100 degreesC for 1 minute lead to a 48.5% +/- 10% (15 runs) decay-corrected radiochemical yield (based on [C-11]methyl triflate). 183 mCi (+/- 39) of [C-11]Me-QNB ([C-11]-1) could be synthesized in only 27 to 28 minutes after EOB and occasionally, up to 340 mCi of [C-11]Me-QNB ([C-11]-1) were obtained, corresponding to a 85% decay-corrected yield. The associated decay-corrected specific radioactivities obtained were 2658 mCi/mu mol (+/- 971) at EOB.

To investigate the relationship between lead and cardiovascular disease/hypertension in lead exposure, beta-adrenergic system is explored in this study. We address three topics in this study: (a) the relationship between beta-adrenergic receptor and lead level in heart, aorta, and kidney of lead-exposed rats; (b) the relationship between beta-adrenergic receptor in heart, aorta, kidney, and blood pressure in lead-exposed rats; and (c) the change of cyclic AMP level in heart, aorta, and kidney of rats with different lead levels. Wistar rats were chronically fed with 2, 1, 0.5, 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01% lead acetate and water for 2 months. Plasma catecholamine level was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Radioligand binding assay was measured by a method that fulfilled strict criteria of beta-adrenoceptor using the ligand [I-125]iodocyanopindolol. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) level was determined by radioimmunoassay. The levels of lead were determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that increased plasma norepinephrine level, decreased aorta beta-adrenergic receptor and cAMP, and increased kidney beta-adrenergic receptor and cAMP contributed to the elevation of blood pressure in lead-induced hypertension. The decrement of beta-adrenoceptor and cAMP in heart resulted in decreased contractility in heart. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

In the present study we show that L3 is able to bind nucleotide triphosphates with high and specific affinity in vitro. L3 was serendipitously identified by screening of a genomic phage library from a primitive kinetoplastid flagellate Trypanoplasma borreli with the ATPase domain of the topoisomerase II gene as a probe. The cloned gene was overexpressed and purified as a his-tag fusion protein in E. coli. Radioligand binding experiments, using [gamma-S-35]ATP, showed that L3 is able to bind ATP but also GTP and UTP with similar high affinity (IC50 50-100 nm), while it has no ATPase activity. Furthermore, we showed that L3 has more than 500-fold higher affinity for nucleotide triphosphates compared to the corresponding nucleotide monophosphates and diphosphates. Molecular genetic and biochemical analyses allowed us to localize the NTP binding domain of L3 to the N-terminal 296 residues. Suramin, a polysulfonated naphthylamine derivative of urea, known for its chemotherapeutic effects completely inhibited the binding of [gamma-S-35]ATP at subclinical levels. Results obtained with surface plasmon resonance technology showed that suramin both forms weak multimolecular complexes with L3 and binds strongly to L3 in nearly stoichiometric amounts.

These enzymes are expressed in a variety of tissues, including the brain, prostate, kidney, testis and jejunum. GCPII has been recognized as a neuropeptidase in the central nervous system, as a folate hydrolase participating in absorption of folates in the jejunum and, most importantly, as a prostate-specific membrane antigen that is highly expressed in prostate adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, it has been identified in the neovasculature of most human solid tumors. In contrast, GCPIII has not been associated with any specific physiological function or pathology, and its expression, activity and inhibition have not been as well-studied. In this review, we provide an overview of the current understanding of the structure, enzymatic activity, substrate specificity, and tissue distribution of these two homologous enzymes. We discuss their potential physiological functions and describe the available animal models, including genetically modified mice. We also review the potential use of specific monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule inhibitors recognizing GCPII/III for diagnosis, imaging and experimental therapy of human cancers and other pathologies.

Two Sig1R-specific radiolabeled enantiomers (S)-(-)- and (R)-(+)[F-18]fluspidine were investigated in several tumor cell lines including melanoma, squamous cell/epidermoid carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, and glioblastoma. Dynamic PET scans were performed in mice to investigate the suitability of both radiotracers for tumor imaging. The Sig1R expression in the respective tumors was confirmed by Western blot. Rather low radiotracer uptake was found in heterotopically (subcutaneously) implanted tumors. Therefore, a brain tumor model (U87-MG) with orthotopic implantation was chosen to investigate the suitability of the two Sig1R radiotracers for brain tumor imaging. High tumor uptake as well as a favorable tumor-to-background ratio was found. These results suggest that Sig1R PET imaging of brain tumors with [F-18]fluspidine could be possible. Further studies with this tumor model will be performed to confirm specific binding and the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB).

Stimulant-induced dopamine increases are markedly blunted in active cocaine abusers	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							STRIATAL DOPAMINE; RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; DORSAL STRIATUM; BRAIN DOPAMINE; HUMANS; RELEASE; METHYLPHENIDATE; DEPENDENCE; TIME; PSYCHOSTIMULANTS	Dopamine signaling in nucleus accumbens is essential for cocaine reward. Interestingly, imaging studies have reported blunted dopamine increases in striatum (assessed as reduced binding of [C-11]raclopride to D-2/D-3 receptors) in detoxified cocaine abusers. Here, we evaluate whether the blunted dopamine response reflected the effects of detoxification and the lack of cocaine-cues during stimulant exposure. For this purpose we studied 62 participants (43 non-detoxified cocaine abusers and 19 controls) using positron emission tomography and [C-11]raclopride (radioligand sensitive to endogenous dopamine) to measure dopamine increases induced by intravenous methylphenidate and in 24 of the cocaine abusers, we also compared dopamine increases when methylphenidate was administered concomitantly with a cocaine cue-video versus a neutral-video. In controls, methylphenidate increased dopamine in dorsal (effect size 1.4; P < 0.001) and ventral striatum (location of accumbens) (effect size 0.89; P < 0.001), but in cocaine abusers methylphenidate's effects did not differ from placebo and were similar whether cocaine-cues were present or not. In cocaine abusers despite the markedly attenuated dopaminergic effects, the methylphenidate-induced changes in ventral striatum were associated with intense drug craving. Our findings are consistent with markedly reduced signaling through D-2 receptors during intoxication in active cocaine abusers regardless of cues exposure, which might contribute to compulsive drug use.

Zyklophin, a short-acting kappa opioid antagonist, induces scratching in mice	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Itch; Scratching; Kappa opioid receptor; Kappa opioid receptor antagonist; Zyklophin	RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; ITCH; MORPHINE; TRK-820; ANALGESIA; RESPONSES; AGONIST; STRESS	It has been shown previously that norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) and 5'-guanidinonaltrindole (5'-GNTI), long-acting kappa opioid receptor (KOPR) antagonists, cause frenzied scratching in mice [1,2]. In the current study, we examined if zyklophin, a short-acting cyclic peptide KOPR antagonist, also elicited scratching behavior. When injected s.c. in the nape of the neck of male Swiss-Webster mice, zyklophin at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg induced dose-related hindleg scratching of the neck between 3 and 15 min after injection. Pretreating mice with norBNI (20 mg/kg, i.p.) at 18-20 h before challenge with zyklophin (0.3 mg/kg) did not markedly affect scratching. Additionally, KOPR-/- mice given 0.3 mg/kg of zyklophin displayed similar levels of scratching as wild-type animals. The absence of KOPR in KOPR-/- mice was confirmed with ex vivo radioligand binding using [H-3]U69,593. Taken together, our data suggest that the presence of kappa receptors is not required for the excessive scratching caused by zyklophin. Thus, zyklophin, similar to the structurally different KOPR antagonist 5'-GNTI, appears to act at other targets to elicit scratching and potentially the sensation of itch.

The results established that (1) fluoxetine was more potent than paroxetine in inhibiting agonist-activated Ca(2+) influx on h alpha 4 beta 2 and h alpha 7 AChRs, whereas the potency of both SSRIs was practically the same in the h alpha 3 beta 4 AChR. However, paroxetine was more potent in the h alpha 7 AChR. (2) SSRIs bind to the [(3)H] imipramine locus with higher affinity when the AChRs are in the desensitized states compared to the resting states. (3) The different receptor specificity for fluoxetine determined by their inhibitory potencies or binding affinities suggests different modes of interaction when the AChR is in the closed or activated state. (4) Neutral and protonated fluoxetine interacts with a binding domain located in the middle of the AChR ion channel. In conclusion, SSRIs inhibit the most important neuronal AChRs with potencies and affinities that are clinically relevant by binding to a luminal site that is shared with tricyclic antidepressants.

Atria frequency, cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, and P-adrenoceptor-binding assay were then examined. Results showed that Se- mice have both a reduction in atria frequency as well as in cAMP content but higher NOS activity levels either at basal or after ISO stimulation. These differences were suppressed by feeding Se- mice with a Se- supplemented diet for 1 wk or by inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Alterations observed after ISO stimulation in atria of Se- mice were not related to a P-adrenoceptor expression modification because specific radioligand-binding parameters in cardiac membranes from Se- mice and Se+ mice were similar. The reduced response on rate and cAMP in atria from Se- mice to direct adenylate cyclase (AC) stimulation by forskolin and the shifted upward levels present in 2-an-Lino-4-methylpyridine-treated Se- mice is in agreement with a negative crosstalk between NOS activity and AC activity in Se- mice.

Longitudinal noninvasive PET-based β cell mass estimates in a spontaneous diabetes rat model	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							VESICULAR MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER; PULSATILE INSULIN-SECRETION; IN-VIVO; PANCREATIC-ISLETS; CHROMAFFIN GRANULE; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; EXPRESSION; GLUCOSE; LANGERHANS; ISOFORMS	Diabetes results from an absolute or relative reduction in pancreatic beta cell mass (BCM) leading to insufficient insulin secretion and hyperglycemia. Measurement of insulin secretory capacity is currently used as a surrogate measure of BCM. However, serum insulin concentrations provide an imprecise index of BCM, and no reliable noninvasive measure of BCM is currently available. Type 2 vesicular monoamine transporters (VMAT2) are expressed in human islet beta cells, as well as in tissues of the CNS. [C-11]Dihydrotetrabenazine ([C-11]DTBZ) binds specifically to VMAT2 and is a radioligand currently used in clinical imaging of the brain. Here we report the use of [C-11]DTBZ to estimate BCM in a rodent model of spontaneous type 1 diabetes (the BB-DP rat). In longitudinal PET studies of the BB-DP rat, we found a significant decline in pancreatic uptake of [C-11]DTBZ that anticipated the loss of glycemic control. Based on comparison of standardized uptake values (SUVs) of [C-11]DTBZ and blood glucose concentrations, loss of more than 65% of the original SUV correlated significantly with the development of persistent hyperglycemia. These studies suggest that PET-based quantitation of VMAT2 receptors provides a noninvasive measurement of BCM that could be used to study the pathogenesis of diabetes and to monitor therapeutic interventions.

In this study, we used radioligand receptor autoradiography to examine whether changes in agonistic behavior following acute and repeated social defeat are accompanied by changes in AVP V1a receptor binding. Social defeat produced high levels of submissive behavior and a loss of territorial aggression when hamsters were subsequently tested with a novel intruder, and repeated agonistic encounters produced similar behavioral changes in subordinates. AVP V1a receptor binding was not reduced by acute social defeat but was affected by repeated agonistic encounters. Dominants had significantly more AVP V1a receptor binding in lateral portions of the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHL) than did their subordinate opponents, but subordinates were no different from controls. In contrast, receptor binding did not differ in most other brain regions examined. The changes in receptor binding appear to be independent of testosterone levels, as testosterone levels did not differ among dominants, subordinates, and controls. Our results suggest that changes in AVP V1a receptors do not account for the changes in agonistic behavior produced by acute social defeat but AVP V1a binding in the VMHL correlates with, and may modulate, the behavioral changes that occur following repeated experiences of victory.

Five untrained and five endurance-trained subjects participated in this study. The density of adenosine A(2A) receptors was evaluated as the distribution volume of [C-11]TMSX in cardiac and triceps brachii muscles in the resting state using PET. The distribution volume of [C-11]TMSX in the myocardium was significantly greater than in the triceps brachii muscle in both groups. Further, distribution volumes [C-11]TMSX in the trained subjects were significantly grater than those in untrained subjects (myocardium, 3.6 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.4 ml g(-1); triceps brachii muscle, 1.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 1.2 +/- 0.2 ml g(-1), respectively). These results indicate that the densities of adenosine A(2A) receptors in the cardiac and skeletal muscles are greater in the endurance-trained men than in the untrained men. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

We examined whether some inhibitors that act on the ATP site of enzymes are also potent adenosine receptor antagonists. Competitive radioligand binding assays in membranes or brain sections show that genistein, chelerythrine, and SQ22536 [9-(tetrahydro-2'-furyl) adenine] block A(1,) A(2A), and A(3) adenosine receptors in concentrations of these drugs commonly used to examine cellular signalling (K-1 of [H-3]-DPCPX (1,3-diproyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine) competition mean (95% confidence interval): 2.6 (1.5-4.8) muM, 5.7 (2.1-15.8) muM, 59.4 (17.3-203.8) muM; K-1 of [H-3]-SCH58261 [5-amino-7-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine] competition: 15.3 (8.1-28.8) muM, 37.6 (10.3-137.4) muM, 16.7 (11.5-24.3) muM for genistein, chelerthine, and SQ22536,respectively). Given that adenosine receptors are present on most cells, that adenosine is often present, and that adenosine receptors interact functionally with several signalling pathways, these results may be of significance also when studying signalling via other receptors.

Radiosyntheses were performed by methylation with high radiochemical purities (>98%) and with specific activities between 140 and 500 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis. The radiochemical yield (decay-corrected, related to [C-11]CH3T) was between 5 and 10%. Positively and negatively radiolabeled enantiomers were prepared in high optical purity (>98%ee) by labeling of the appropriate optically active substrates, which were obtained via chiral high performance liquid chromatography. For in vivo studies radioligands were administered intravenously in rats. Brain uptake curves were acquired and combined with blocking experiments. Brain uptake of N-[C-11]methyl-NorchloroEPB was similar to that of N-[C-11]methyl-EPB whereas N-[C-11]methyl-2PABH with the modified pyridine ring had a significantly lower uptake.

J	Gubitz, AK; Reppert, SM				Gubitz, AK; Reppert, SM			Chimeric and point-mutated receptors reveal that a single glycine residue in transmembrane domain 6 is critical for high affinity melatonin binding	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; LIGAND-BINDING; CLONING; BRAIN; RECOGNITION; MUTAGENESIS; RESPONSES; CLOCK	To delineate domains of high affinity melatonin receptors that are essential for melatonin binding, we generated chimeras between the human Mel(1a) melatonin receptor and the melatonin-related orphan H9 receptor. The latter receptor displays no high affinity melatonin binding. The chimeric receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and analyzed by radioligand binding using 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin ([I-125]Mel). Replacement of individual transmembrane domains (TMs) of the Mel(1a) receptor by the corresponding H9 helixes revealed that TM6 plays a critical role in ligand binding. Substitution of H9-TM6 into the Mel(1a) receptor abolished any detectable [I-125]Mel binding, whereas the remaining TMs could be readily exchanged without affecting ligand binding. Subsequent site-directed mutagenesis showed that glycine 20 in TM6 of the Mel(1a) receptor occupies an important position in the binding site. Thus, the mutation of glycine 20 to threonine, the corresponding H9 residue, severely reduced the receptor's affinity for melatonin. Furthermore, the double mutation of alanine 14 to cysteine and of glycine 20 to threonine in TM6 completely eliminated high affinity [I-125]Mel binding. This strongly suggests that molecular modifications in TM6 that involve glycine 20 lead to steric incompatibilities in the binding pocket that prohibit high affinity melatonin binding.

New Drug Approvals in Prostate Cancer and Their Effect on the Treatment Landscape	CLINICAL ADVANCES IN HEMATOLOGY & ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Castration-resistant prostate cancer; hormone-sensitive prostate cancer novel; therapeutics prostate cancer	MITOXANTRONE PLUS PREDNISONE; ANDROGEN-RECEPTOR; SIPULEUCEL-T; OPEN-LABEL; ABIRATERONE ACETATE; PRECISION MEDICINE; INCREASED SURVIVAL; ENZALUTAMIDE; DOCETAXEL; THERAPY	Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed non-skin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in men in the United States. Over the past decade, the treatment landscape for advanced prostate cancer has rapidly shifted. For decades, androgen deprivation therapy has been the cornerstone of systemic treatment for patients with metastatic hormone -sensi-tive prostate cancer (mHSPC). However, more recently, we have seen the emergence of doublet and triplet combinations in the mHSPC setting. At the same time, there is an expanding list of treatments for patients with metastatic castration-resistant pros-tate cancer (mCRPC), including hormonal treatments, chemother-apy, immunotherapy, bone-targeted agents, radioligand therapy, and targeted therapy. The shifting of the treatment landscape for advanced prostate cancer has raised many questions regarding patient selection, therapy choice, and sequencing of different approved agents, particularly in the mCRPC setting with the earlier use of chemotherapy and androgen receptor signaling inhibitors. Since then, multiple trials have been conducted to improve the management of mHSPC and delay its progression to mCRPC.

Since biopsies are challenging for brain tumors, molecular imaging may be a technique of choice to target and follow tumor evolution. So far, MR remains the imaging technique of reference for DIPG, although it often fails to define the extent of tumors, an essential parameter for therapeutic efficacy assessment. Thanks to its high sensitivity, positron emission tomography (PET) offers a unique way to target specific biomarkers in vivo. We demonstrated in a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model in the rat that the translocator protein of 18 kDa (TSPO) may be a promising biomarker for monitoring DIPG tumors. We studied the distribution of 18F-DPA-714, a TSPO radioligand, in rats inoculated with HSJD-DIPG-007 cells. The primary DIPG human cell line HSJD-DIPG-007 highly represents this pediatric tumor, displaying the most prevalent DIPG mutations, H3F3A (K27M) and ACVR1 (R206H). Kinetic modeling and parametric imaging using the brain 18F-DPA-714 PET data enabled specific delineation of the DIPG tumor area, which is crucial for radiotherapy dose management.

[<SUP>11</SUP>C]PK11195-PET Brain Imaging of the Mitochondrial Translocator Protein in Mitochondrial Disease	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							CYTOCHROME-C-OXIDASE; 18 KDA TSPO; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; BINDING-SITES; PET; NEURONS; DNA; DEFICIENCY; EXPRESSION	Objective To explore the possibilities of radioligands against the mitochondrial outer membrane translocator protein (TSPO) as biomarkers for mitochondrial disease, we performed brain PET-MRI with [C-11]PK11195 in 14 patients with genetically confirmed mitochondrial disease and 33 matched controls. Methods Case-control study of brain PET-MRI with the TSPO radioligand [C-11]PK11195. Results Forty-six percent of symptomatic patients had volumes of abnormal radiotracer binding greater than the 95th percentile in controls. [C-11]PK11195 binding was generally greater in gray matter and significantly decreased in white matter. This was most striking in patients with nuclear TYMP or mitochondrial m.3243A>G MT-TL1 mutations, in keeping with differences in mitochondrial density seen postmortem. Some regional binding patterns corresponded to clinical presentation and underlying mutation, even in the absence of structural changes on MRI. This was most obvious for the cerebellum, where patients with ataxia had decreased binding in the cerebellar cortex, but not necessarily volume loss. Overall, there was a positive correlation between aberrant [C-11]PK11195 binding and clinical severity. Conclusion These findings endorse the use of PET imaging with TSPO radioligands as a noninvasive in vivo biomarker of mitochondrial pathology. Classification of Evidence This study provides Class III evidence that brain PET-MRI with TSPO radioligands identifies mitochondrial pathology.

Based on the lead compounds 1-3, the thieno-benzazecine regioisomers 4 and 5 were synthesized and biologically evaluated for their affinity towards the five dopamine receptor subtypes utilizing a radioligand binding affinity technique. Within the D-1-like family, compound 4 showed 20 fold selectivity for the D-5 subtype over D-1 subtype (K-i = 3 nM, D-1: 60 nM), while its regioisomer, compound 5 with a reversed thiophene position, prefers the D-1 subtype over the D-5 subtype (K-i = 4 nM, D-5: 15 nM). The benzothieno-benzazecine analog 6 was shown to be one of the few azecine derivatives with high affinity for both the D-1- and the D-2-like family members in the same order of magnitude (K-i = 1.5 nM for D-2 and 1.9 nM for D-5). Thorough analysis of the amino acid residues constituting the binding pockets of the target dopamine receptor subtypes revealed that at the D-5 receptor, either serine S 6.62 and threonine T 7.33 residues or a water network, stabilized by anionic amino acids could contribute to the selectivity pattern of the synthesized compounds.

The binding of the probe was saturable and revealed a high-affinity interaction (K-D = 0.24 nM) with a single class of binding sites. It was also able to affinity label NPFF2 receptor in a specific and efficient manner given that 38% of the bound radioligand at saturating concentration formed a wash-resistant binding after ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. Photoaffinity labeling with [I-125]YE(Bpa)WSLAAPQRFamide showed two molecular forms of NPFF2 receptor with apparent molecular weights of 140 and 95 kDa in a 2:1 ratio. The comparison of the results between photoaffinity labeling and Western blot analysis suggests that all receptor forms bind the probe irreversibly with the same efficiency. On membranes of mouse olfactory bulb, only the high molecular weight form of NPFF2 receptor is observed.[I-125]YE(Bpa)WSLAAPQRFamide is an excellent radioiodinated peptidic ligand for direct and selective labeling of NPFF2 receptors in vitro.

We have developed binary classification quantitative structure activity relationship (QSAR) models of 5-HT1A receptor binding activity using data retrieved from the PDSP K-i database. The prediction accuracy of these models was estimated by external 5-fold cross-validation as well as using an additional validation set comprising 66 structurally distinct compounds from the World of Molecular Bioactivity database. These validated models were then used to mine three major types of chemical screening libraries, i.e., drug-like libraries, GPCR targeted libraries, and diversity libraries, to identify novel computational hits. The five best hits from each class of libraries were chosen for further experimental testing in radioligand binding assays, and nine of the 15 hits were confirmed to be active experimentally with binding affinity better than 10 mu M. The most active compound, Lysergol, from the diversity library showed very high binding affinity (K-i) of 2.3 nM against 5-HT1A receptor. The novel 5-HT1A actives identified with the QSAR-based virtual screening approach could be potentially developed as novel anxiolytics or potential antischizophrenic drugs.

Derivatives of Dibenzothiophene for Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of α<i>7</i>-Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO EVALUATION; NEURONAL NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; BINDING-SITES; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; RAT-BRAIN; AGONIST; RADIOLIGANDS; LIGAND; MICE; PET	A new series of derivatives of 3-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)dibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide with high binding affinities and selectivity for alpha 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (alpha 7-nAChRs) (K-i = 0.4-20 nM) has been synthesized for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of alpha 7-nAChRs. Two radiolabeled members of the series [F-18]7a (K-i = 0.4 nM) and [F-18]7c (K-i = 1.3 nM) were synthesized. [F-18]7a and [F-18]7c readily entered the mouse brain and specifically labeled alpha 7-nAChRs. The alpha 7-nAChR selective ligand 1 (SSR180711) blocked the binding of [F-18]7a in the mouse brain in a dose-dependent manner. The mouse blocking studies with non-alpha 7-nAChR central nervous system drugs demonstrated that [F-18]7a is highly alpha 7-nAChR selective. In agreement with its binding affinity the binding potential of [F-18]7a (BPND = 5.3-8.0) in control mice is superior to previous alpha 7-nAChR PET radioligands. Thus, [F-18]7a displays excellent imaging properties in mice and has been chosen for further evaluation as a potential PET radioligand for imaging of alpha 7-nAChR in non-human primates.

Starting from the nonsubstituted phenanthridine compound 4a, exhibiting a K-i value of 51 nM on the 5-HT4R, we explored the structure affinity in this series. We found that substitution in position 4 of the tricycle with a fluorine atom gave the best result. Introduction of an additional nitrogen atom inside the tricyclic framework led to an increase of both the affinity and selectivity for 5-HT4R, suggesting the design of the antagonist 4v, exhibiting a high affinity of 0.04 nM. Several iodinated analogues were then synthesized as potential SPECT tracers. The iodinated compound lid was able to displace the reference radioiodinated 5-HT4R antagonist (1-butylpiperidin-4-tracers yl)methyl-8-amino-7-iodo[I-123]-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxine-5-carboxylate {[I-123]1, [I-123]SB 207710} both in vitro and in vivo in brain. Compound 11d was radiolabeled with [I-125]iodine, providing a potential SPECT candidate for brain imaging of 5-HT4R.

Synthesis and Characterization of Iodinated Tetrahydroquinolines Targeting the G Protein-Coupled Estrogen Receptor GPR30	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BREAST-CANCER; G-PROTEIN-COUPLED-RECEPTOR-30 GPR30; GENE-EXPRESSION; 17-BETA-ESTRADIOL; TRANSACTIVATION; RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; ACTIVATION; AFFINITY	A series of iodo-substituted tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolines was synthesized as potential targeted imaging agents for the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor GPR30. The affinity and specificity of binding to GPR30 versus the classical estrogen receptors ER alpha/beta and functional responses associated with ligand-binding were determined. Selected iodo-substituted tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinolines exhibited IC50 values lower than 20 nM in competitive binding studies with GPR30-expressing human endometrial cancer cells. These compounds functioned as antagonists of GPR30 and blocked estrogen-induced PI3K activation and calcium mobilization. The tributylstannyl precursors of selected compounds were radiolabeled with I-125 using the iodogen method. In vivo biodistribution studies in female ovariectomized athymic (NCr) nu/nu mice bearing GPR30-expressing human endometrial tumors revealed GPR30-mediated uptake of the radiotracer ligands in tumor, adrenal, and reproductive organs. Biodistribution and quantitative SPECT/CT studies revealed structurally related differences in the pharmacokinetic profiles, target tissue uptake, and metabolism of the radiolabeled compounds as well as differences in susceptibility to deiodination. The high lipophilicity of the compounds adversely affects the in vivo biodistribution and clearance of these radioligands and suggests that further optimization of this parameter may lead to improved targeting characteristics.

Potassium 4-(cyclohexylpiperazin-1-yl)-dithioformate, 2, and the corresponding rhenium complex, ReN-2, were synthesized and characterized. ReN-2 possessed moderate affinity toward sigma(1) (K-i = 1.94 +/- 0.60 mu mol/L) and sigma(2) (K-i = 2.83 +/- 1.39 mu mol/L) receptors. The radiolabeled complex (TcN)-Tc-99m-2 was prepared in high yield (> 95%) through the [(TcN)-Tc-99m](int)(2+) precursor and characterized by HPLC. (TcN)-Tc-99m-2 was found to be a lipophilic and neutral complex with good stability. The biodistribution in tumor-bearing mice showed that (TcN)-Tc-99m-2 had good tumor uptake (2.12 +/- 0.01 %ID/g at 2 h p.i.) and moderate brain uptake (0.27 +/- 0.05 %ID/g at 2 h p.i.). After blocking with haloperidol, the uptakes by tumor and brain were lower than control. The results indicated that the complex has specific binding to the sigma receptors in vivo. Further structural modifications of this complex are needed to obtain Tc-99m-based a receptor imaging agents with high affinity and subtype selectivity. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Not only ionotropic but also metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu receptors) have been suggested to be involved in the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. Moreover, several mGlu receptor ligands possess a great antidepressant potential. Group II mGlu receptor antagonists have been shown to induce antidepressant-like effects in rodents. An influence of chronic antidepressant treatment on group II mGlu receptors has also been suggested. In our studies, we examined an influence of repeated (21-day) imipramine treatment on the density of group II mGlu receptors and affinity of mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor radioligand [H-3]-LY341495 for group II mGlu receptors in the rat brain hippocampus and frontal cortex. Moreover, we analyzed an influence of chronic imipramine administration on the ability of group II mGlu receptor agonist, 2R,4R-APDC, to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation in the rat brain cortical slices. We found that inhibitory properties of group II mGlu receptors were diminished after chronic, but not acute imipramine administration. However, no changes in the density or affinity of the mGlu2 and mGlu3 receptor ligand for group II mGlu receptors were observed.

The beta-adrenoceptor (beta-AR) plays an important role in heart failure. Recently, the new tracer (S)-[C-11]CGP12388 has been developed. It displays excellent properties for investigation of the cardiac beta-ARs in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET). Furthermore, the simple production method allows its use in a routine clinical setting. The aim of this study was to investigate whether decreased myocardial beta-AR density in patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) can be estimated using (S)-[C-11]CGP12388 PET. Methods. Myocardial beta-AR density was investigated in six patients with IDC and six age-matched healthy controls, using (S)-[C-11]CGP12388 PET. Results. beta-AR densities of 5.4 +/- 1.3 pmol/g (mean +/- SD) were observed in patients; these values were significantly lower than those observed in healthy controls (8.4 +/- 1.5 pmol/g, p < 0.005). Conclusion. This study indicates that PET with (S)-[C-11]CGP12388 is applicable for the measurement of myocardial beta-AR density in patients. A highly significant reduction in beta-AR density was found in patients with IDC compared with healthy controls.

A 26-year-old team athlete increased his training volume (by 200%) and intensity markedly in a new high-level team. After two months, he started to feel continuous fatigue. He had tinnitus in his left ear, he felt disturbing palpitation and had pollacisuria. After four months, he started to suffer from insomnia. He still continued to play for another three months, after which he was unable to play. He could only sleep for 3 to 4 hours per night. Only minor abnormalities could be found in extensive physical and laboratory examinations. The athlete had a severe overtraining state. In the brain SPELT scans, using the specific radioligand for serotonin transporter imaging (I-123 labelled 2beta-carbomethoxy-3(3-[4-iodophenyl]-nortropane), low activity areas were detected in the midbrain, anterior gingulus, and left frontal and temporo-occipital lobes. In a psychiatric examination, the patient was found to have signs of major depression, which he hardly recognized himself. We conclude, that that the severe overtraining state could have been related to decreased serotonin reuptake in the brain and signs of major depression.

The effects of the methanol extract of AGR on excitotoxic neuronal death were evaluated in the present study using cultured rat cortical neurons. Based on the phase-contrast microscopic examinations of cultures and lactate dehydrogenase activities measured in the culture media, the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity was significantly inhibited by the extract. The inhibitory action of the extract was more potent and selective for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated toxicity. The AGR extract competed with [H-3]MDL 105,519 for the specific binding to the glycine site of the NMDA receptor with the IC50 value of 164.7 mug/ml. Modulation of the NMDA receptor activity by the extract was determined using [H-3]MK-801 binding studies. The reduction of the binding in the presence of the extract indicated the receptor inactivation by AGR. These results demonstrated that the methanol extract of AGR exhibited protective action against excitotoxic neuronal death, and that the neuroprotective action was primarily due to the blockade of NMDA receptor function by the interaction with the glycine binding site of the receptor.

Several studies suggested G proteins as novel drug targets for the treatment of complex diseases, e.g., asthma and cancer. Recently, we developed specific radiotracers, [H-3]PSB-15900-FR and [H-3]PSB-16254-YM, for the G alpha(q) family of G proteins by tritiation of the macrocyclic natural products FR900359 (FR) and YM-254890 (YM). In the present study, we utilized these potent radioligands to perform autoradiography studies in tissues of healthy mice, mouse models of disease, and human tissues. Specific binding was high, while non-specific binding was extraordinarily low, giving nearly identical results for both radioligands. High expression levels of G alpha(q) proteins were detected in healthy mouse organs showing the following rank order of potency: kidney > liver > brain > pancreas > lung > spleen, while expression in the heart was low. Organ sub-structures, e.g., of mouse brain and lung, were clearly distinguishable. Whereas an acute asthma model in mice did not result in altered G alpha(q) protein expressions as compared to control animals, a cutaneous melanoma model displayed significantly increased expression in comparison to healthy skin. These results suggest the future development of G alpha(q)-protein-binding radio-tracers as novel diagnostics.

According to this, the possibility of using the Monte Carlo (MC) method in radiation planning systems is proposed in this work, since this technique could affect positively on the patient treatment. The proposed methodology provides 3D dose results that are more accurate and considers the inhomogeneities density variations. This paper presents a MC simulation of two different prostate cancer treatments using the latest version of MCNP, v.6.1.1; brachytherapy with I-125 seeds and radiolabeled Lu-177-PSMA. To that, a 3D model of the anatomy of a real anonymized patient is created from the segmentation of Computed Tomography (CT) images. Treatments over this 3D model is simulated and the dose given to the prostate and each surrounding organ is obtained for both treatments. Results have been verified with doses calculated by deterministic planning system used in hospital in the case of brachytherapy treatment, demonstrating the efficiency of MC method in the development of radiation cancer treatments, not only because of the results accuracy but also concerning the clinical affordable computing times.

In view of fluorescent probes for BRET-based binding studies and for localizing the H4R in live cells, we synthesized and biologically characterized Py-5-labeled histamine derivatives. The most notable compound was UR-DEBa242 (26, 1-[4-(1H-Imidazol-4-yl)butyl]-4-{(1E,3E)-4-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]buta-1,3-dienyl}-2,6-dimethylpyridinium hydrotrifluoroacetate trifluoroacetate), acting as a partial agonist at the hH(3)R [pEC(50) (reporter gene) 8.77] and as an inverse agonist/antagonist at the h/mH(4)Rs [pIC(50) (reporter gene) 8.76/7.08; pIC(50)/pK(b) (beta-arrestin2) 7.81/7.30]. In confocal microscopy, 26 proved suitable for hH(4)R localization and trafficking studies in live cells. BRET-based binding at the NLuc-hH(3,4)Rs/mH(4)R [pK(d) 8.78/7.75/7.18, comparable to binding constants from radioligand binding/flow cytometry; fast association/dissociation (similar to 2 min)] revealed 26 as a useful molecular tool to determine hH(3,4)Rs/mH(4)R binding affinities of ligands binding to these receptors.

The proposed method indirectly implements the noninvasive Logan plot, through arithmetic combination of the parameters of two other noninvasive methods and the apparent tissue-to-plasma efflux rate constant for the reference region (k(2)'). We investigated its validity and statistical properties, by performing a simulation study with various noise levels and k(2)' values, and also evaluated its feasibility for [F-18] FP-CIT PET in human brain. The results revealed that the proposed approach provides distribution volume ratio estimation comparable to the Logan plot at low noise levels while improving underestimation caused by non-RE state differently depending on k(2)'. Furthermore, the proposed method was able to avoid noise-induced bias of the Logan plot, and the variability of its results was less dependent on k(2)' than the Logan plot. Therefore, this approach, without issues related to arterial blood sampling given a pre-estimate of k(2)' (e.g. population-based), could be useful in parametric image generation for slow kinetic tracers staying in a non-RE state within a PET scan.

Receptor screening technologies in the evaluation of Amazonian ethnomedicines with potential applications to cognitive deficits	JOURNAL OF ETHNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Cognitive disorders; Dementia; Mental disorders; Ethnomedicine; Rodioligand assay; Ethnopharmacology; Drug prospecting	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DRUG DEVELOPMENT; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; MOLECULAR TARGETS; NATURAL-PRODUCTS; BINDING ASSAYS; SALVINORIN-A; IN-VITRO; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PLANTS	Ethnopharmacological relevance: Amazonian peoples utilize a variety of psychoactive plants that may contain novel biologically active compounds. Efforts to investigate such remedies in terms of neuropharmacology have been limited. Aim of this study: This study identified Amazonian ethnomedicines with potential for the treatment of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and dementias, and characterized their interactions with CNS neurotransmitter receptors in vitro. Materials and methods: Approximately 300 Amazonian species with folk uses or constituents indicative of central nervous system activity were incorporated into a database constructed from literature searches, herbarium surveys, and interviews with traditional practitioners. Approximately 130 of these targeted species were collected in Loreto province, Peru, and 228 fractions derived from them were screened in 31 radioreceptor assays via the resources of the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program. A subset was also screened in functional assays at selected serotonin, muscarinic, and adrenergic receptors. Results: Ninety-one samples displayed >= 60% inhibition of radioligand binding activity in receptor assays; 135 samples displayed agonist or antagonist activity (or both) in functional assays. Conclusions: Potential CNS activity was detected in about 40% of the samples screened, with some correlations to both folk uses and phytochemical constituents. These results may point to novel and potentially therapeutic CNS active compounds. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The aim of this study was thus to develop a cost-effective multivariate screening method for determination of the influence of different factors on the outcome of such studies, using (125)l-labelled vasoactive intestinal peptide binding on lung homogenate as a model. The study was divided into two parts: investigation of filtration for bound-unbound ligand separation, and screening of sample incubation variables. Experimental designs were used (including Plackett-Burman) to evaluate adsorption, total binding, non-specific binding, specific binding and (non-)specific/total binding ratio. Several significant factors were identified. For filtration, a combination of polyethylenimine and BSA filter pretreatment was best whereas albumin-containing washing solvent negatively influenced the amount of specific bound radioligand. For sample incubation, significant effects on one or more of the studied responses were observed for several factors. Bacitracin protease inhibitor also decreased adsorption. We report here multivariate experimental designs for screening of peptide (radio)ligand receptor binding assay conditions. This approach efficiently minimizes the risk on false negative results due to inappropriate operational conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We previously reported that the growth of B16-BL6 mouse melanoma (B16-BL6) cells was inhibited by cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), an active ingredient of C. sinensis, and its effect was antagonized by MRS1191, a selective adenosine A(3) receptor antagonist. In this study, the radioligand binding assay using [I-125]-AB-MECA (a selective adenosine A(3) receptor agonist) has shown that B16-BL6 cells express adenosine A(3) receptors and that cordycepin binds to these receptors. We also confirmed the involvement of adenosine A(3) receptors in the action of cordycepin using MRS1523 and MRS1220, specific adenosine A(3) receptor antagonists. Next, indirubin, a glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3 beta) inhibitor, antagonized the growth suppression induced by cordycepin. Furthermore, the level of cyclin D-1 protein in B16-BL6 cells was decreased by cordycepin using Western blot analysis. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that cordycepin inhibits the proliferation of B16-BL6 cells by stimulating adenosine A(3) receptors followed by the Wnt signaling pathway, including GSK-3 beta activation and cyclin D-1 inhibition.

Multiple-injection PET experimental protocols with injections of radiolabeled and unlabeled doses of fallypride Were used to estimate the K-1, k(2), k(on)/V-R, k(off) and B-max' kinetic parameters. The experimental design was chosen using the D-optimal criterion to maximize the precision of the estimated binding parameters for the various brain regions. There was a significant range in B-max' for the putamen (27pmol/mL), caudate (23pmol/mL), ventral striatum (14pmol/mL), thalamus (1.8pmol/mL) and amygdala (0.9pmol/mL). Significant receptor binding was also found in the cortical regions. Knowledge of these in vivo rate constants serves as a necessary step in using [F-18]fallypride PET to measure D2/D3 receptor density and drug occupancy in clinical research applications. We believe the precise parameter estimates derived from these complicated experimental protocols are necessary for proper application of drug occupancy and clinical research studies with [F-18]fallypride, which often rely on the validity of assumptions regarding the model parameters.

In this paper, we report the results of investigations into dopaminergic D-1 and serotonergic 5-HT-2A receptors in the brain of rats subjected to CUS procedure and treated chronically with imipramine. We have examined the dopaminergic D-1 ([H-3-SCH 23390) in the limbic area and serotonergic 5-HT-2A ([H-3-ketanserin) receptors in the cerebral cortex by a saturation radioligand binding method in rats subjected to CUS paradigm, imipramine, both CUS and imipramine and control animals. CUS procedure resulted in a significant 36% increase in the D-1 receptor density in the limbic system, which was attenuated by chronic imipramine treatment. Also a 21% increase in the density of 5-HT-2A receptors in the cerebral cortex induced by CUS was reduced by chronic imipramine treatment. The present data indicate that the increases in the density of brain D-1 and 5-HT-2A receptors of rats subjected to CUS, which are "normalized" by imipramine, might be involved in the pathophysiology of "animal depression" (and, thus, in pathophysiology of human depression) and in the mechanism of antidepressant therapy.

Our results demonstrate that rat carotid bodies express the A(2A) and A(2B) Ado receptor mRNAs but not the A(1) or A(3) receptor mRNAs as determined by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. In situ hybridization confirmed the expression of the A(2A) receptor mRNA. Immunohistochemical studies further showed that the A(2A) receptor is expressed in the carotid body and that it is colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase in type I cells. Whole cell voltage-clamp studies using isolated type I cells showed that Ado inhibited the voltage-dependent Ca2+ currents and that this inhibition was abolished by the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist ZM-241385. Ca2+ imaging studies using fura 2 revealed that exposure to severe hypoxia induced elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) in type I cells and that extracellularly applied Ado significantly attenuated the hypoxia-induced elevation of [Ca2+](i). Taken together, our findings indicate that A(2A) receptors are present in type I cells and that activation of A(2A) receptors modulates Ca2+ accumulation during hypoxia. This mechanism may play a role in regulating intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and cellular excitability during hypoxia.

Animal models of anxiety involving exposure to chronic stress have shown a specific decrease in benzodiazepine receptor binding in frontal cortex and hippocampus, The purpose of this study was to examine benzodiazepine receptor binding patients with panic disorder and comparison subjects. Methods: A quantitative measure related to benzodiazepine receptor binding (Distribution Volume (DV)) was obtained with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of [I-123]iomazenil and measurement of radioligand concentration in plasma in patients with panic disorder and healthy controls. DV image data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping (spm96). Results: A decrease in measures benzodiazepine receptor binding (DV) was found in left hippocampus and precuneus in panic disorder patients relative to controls. Panic disorder patients who had a panic attack compared to patients who did not have a panic attack at the time of the scan had a decrease in benzodiazepine receptor binding in prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: Findings of a decrease in left hippocampal and precuneus benzodiazepine receptor binding may be related to alterations in benzodiazepine receptor binding, or other factors including changes in GABAergic transmission or possible endogenous benzodiazepine compounds. Benzodiazepine receptor function in prefrontal cortex appears to be involved in changes in state-related panic anxiety. (C) 2000 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

A radioligand binding assay was developed using a novel iodinated vasopressin V-2 receptor antagonist to analyze vasopressin V-2 receptor binding in kidney inner medullary tissue from three groups of rats: normal rats maintained on ad libitum water intake, rats heated with 1-deamino-[8-D-arginine]vasopressin (DDAVP), and rats treated with DDAVP that were also water loaded to induce renal escape from antidiuresis. Analysis of the binding data showed that DDAVP treatment reduced vasopressin V-2 receptor binding to 72% of normal levels. Water loading induced a marked further down-regulation of vasopressin V-2 receptor binding. This receptor down-regulation began by day 2 of water loading, which correlated with the initiation of renal vasopressin escape; by day 3 of water loading, vasopressin V-2 receptor expression fell to 43% of DDAVP-treated levels. No differences in vasopressin V-2 receptor binding affinities were found among the three groups. This study demonstrates that vasopressin V-2 receptor binding capacity is down-regulated during renal escape from vasopressin-induced antidiuresis and suggests that both vasopressin-dependent mechanisms as well as vasopressin-independent mechanisms associated with water loading are involved in this receptor down-regulation.

The radiopharmaceutical(223)Ra-dichloride has been recently introduced for the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) of metastastic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). However, since(223)Ra-dichloride targets only skeletal lesions, its use in clinical practice is recommended only in subjects without visceral metastases. To overcome this, several efforts have been made to develop radiopharmaceuticals suitable for TAT and specifically directed toward the biomarker prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), overexpressed by both skeletal and visceral metastases from mCRPC. Areas covered The radiobiological principles concerning TAT applications are covered, with particular emphasis on its pros and cons, especially in comparison with beta-emitter radionuclide therapy. Furthermore, the role of PSMA as a theranostic target for imaging and therapy is reviewed. Lastly, the pre-clinical and clinical applications of TAT through 225Actinium ((225)AC) and 213Bismuth (Bi-213) are discussed. Expert opinion PSMA-based TAT holds the promise of becoming a powerful tool for the management of mCRPC. Nevertheless, several issues have still to be addressed, especially concerning TAT toxicity. Furthermore, several efforts have to be made for identifying the more adequate alpha-emitter (Ac-225 vs(213)Bi) with a view to the patient's tailored therapeutic approach.

Therefore, several triazaspirodecanone derivatives were synthesized. Here, we verify their selectivity towards other 5-HT1 receptor subtypes and with respect to alpha(2)-AR (Adrenergic Receptors). Methods Binding affinities were determined on cells expressing human cloned receptors for 5-HT1A/B/D and alpha(2A/B/C) subtypes. The Ki values were determined for those with at least 50% radioligand inhibition. Results All our derivatives show a moderate affinity for alpha(2) subtypes, spanning from 5 to 7.5 pK(i) values. Moreover, they show affinity values in a mu M-nM range at the 5-HT1A receptor, while they are practically inactive at 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D subtypes. Compound 11, the best of the series, has a 5-HT1A pK(i) value of 8.43 similar to spiroxatrine but, notably, it has a 5-HT1A favorable selectivity ratio of 52, 8 and 29, respectively over alpha(2A), alpha(2B) and alpha(2C) adrenoceptor subtypes. Conclusions In this SAR study, a 5-HT1A selective ligand has been identified in which a tetralone moiety replaced the 1,4-benzodioxane of spiroxatrine and the methylene linker to the triazaspirodecanone portion was maintained in position 2.

The present study provided a broad inquiry into its anticonvulsant properties. LY3130481 was anticonvulsant in multiple acute seizure provocation models in mice and rats. In addition, LY3130481 was effective against absence seizures in the GAERS genetic model and in the Frings mouse model. Likewise, LY3130481 attenuated convulsions in mice and rats with long-term induction of seizures (e.g., corneal, pentylenetetrazole, hippocampal, and amygdala kindled seizures). In slices of epileptic human cortex, LY3130481 significantly decreased neuronal firing frequencies. LY3130481 displaced from rat brain a radioligand specific for AMPA receptors associated with TARP gamma-8 whereas non-TARP-selective molecules did not. Binding was also observed in hippocampus freshly transected from a patient. Results & Conclusion: Taken as a whole, the findings reported here establish the broad anticonvulsant efficacy of LY3130481 indicating that blockade of AMPA receptors associated with TARP gamma-8 is sufficient for these protective effects.

Sensitization to psychostimulants and resultant alteration of dopaminergic neurotransmission in rodents have been suggested as a useful model of schizophrenia. This study was aimed to examine the use of methylphenidate as a psychostimulant to induce dopamine release and that of [F-18]fallypride as a radioligand to estimate the release in a rat model of schizophrenia. Six rats were scanned by positron emission tomography (PET) twice before and after methylphenidate challenge to evaluate dopamine release. After the scans, these rats were sensitized by using repeated methamphetamine (MAP) administration. Then, they were re-scanned twice again before and after methylphenidate challenge to evaluate whether MAP-sensitized rats show greater sensitivity to methylphenidate. We revealed a main effect of MAP-pretreatment and that of metylphenidate challenge. We found that % change of distribution volume ratio after repeated administration of MAP was greater than that before sensitization. These results suggest that methylphenidate-induced striatal dopamine release increased after sensitization to MAP. PET scan using [F-18]fallypride at methylphenidate-challenge may provide a biological marker for schizophrenia and be useful to diagnose schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Pilar			New selective A<sub>2A</sub> agonists and A<sub>3</sub> antagonists for human adenosine receptors: synthesis, biological activity and molecular docking studies	MEDCHEMCOMM			English	Article							DERIVATIVES; BINDING; LIGAND	We report the synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a new series of adenosine derivatives on the four adenosine receptors (ARs). In radioligand binding assays, some of the compounds (1, 4, 6 and (R)-6) display a potent affinity for the A(2A)AR (K-i values < 10 nM) with high A(1)/A(2A) and A(2B)/A(2A) selectivity, moderate for the A(3)AR and low for the A(1)AR. The affinity of the epimeric mixture 6 was similar to that of the corresponding (R)-6 stereoisomer and 10-fold higher than that of the (S)-6 stereoisomer. The phenylethylamino group appears to play a key role on the activity, but introduction of groups of different sizes and electronegativity does not induce a substantial change in affinity for the A(2A)AR. In functional assays, most of the compounds produced similar amounts of cAMP compared to NECA, thus behaving as full A(2A)AR agonists. In addition, compounds 1, 2, 3, 5, (S)-6 and 9 resulted to be good antagonists for A(3)AR with K-B in the 6-14 nM range. Docking studies on the A(2A)AR showed a conserved binding mode consistent with previous A(2A)AR agonist-bound crystal structures, allowing for a rational interpretation of the SAR of this compound series.

Adenosine receptors (ARs) binding activity and selectivity of the synthesized compounds 1-9 were evaluated in this study. Different substituents were introduced in both benzene rings of the evaluated scaffold, at positions 6 and 3 or 4 of the moiety. The lack of data on the 3-arylcoumarin scaffold encouraged us to explore the ARs' binding activity of a selected series of derivatives. MethodsA new series of coumarins (compounds 1-9) were synthesized and evaluated by radioligand binding studies towards ARs. Key findingsAnalysing the experimental data, it can be observed that neither the simple 3-arylcoumarin nor the 4-nitro derivatives presented detectable binding affinity for the evaluated receptors, although most of the other substituted derivatives have good binding affinity profiles, especially against the hA(1)/hA(3) or only hA(3) AR. ConclusionsThe most remarkable derivative is compound 2, presenting the best affinity for hA(3) AR (K-i=2680 nM) and significant selectivity for this subtype.

A novel concept of radiosynthesis of a <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-labeled dimeric RGD peptide as a potential radiotracer for tumor imaging	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Angiogenesis; Integrin alpha(v)beta(3); RGD; [(TcN)-Tc-99m](+2) precursor complex	BREAST-CANCER; INTEGRIN ALPHA(V)BETA(3); EXCRETION KINETICS; EXPRESSION; F-18-AH111585; RADIOLIGAND	Radiolabeled Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) peptides are promising agents for non invasive imaging of alpha(v)beta(3) expression in malignant tumors. The integrin alpha(v)beta(3) binding affinity and consequent tumor uptake could be improved when a dimeric RGD peptide is used as the targeting moiety instead of a monomer. Towards this, a novel approach was envisaged to synthesize a Tc-99m labeled dimeric RGD derivative using a RGD monomer and [(TcN)-Tc-99m](+2) intermediate. The dithiocarbamate derivative of cyclic RGD peptide G(3)-c(RGDfK) (G(3) = Gly-Gly-Gly, f = Phe, K = Lys) was synthesized and radiolabeled with [(TcN)-Tc-99m](+2) intermediate to form the (TcN)-Tc-99m-[G(3)-c(RGDfK)](2) complex in high yield (similar to 98%). Biodistribution studies carried out in C57/BL6 mice bearing melanoma tumors showed good tumor uptake [4.61 +/- 0.04% IA/g at 30 min post-injection] with fast clearance of the activity from non-target organs/tissue. Scintigraphic imaging studies showed visible accumulation of activity in the tumor with appreciable target to background ratio. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

These include fluorescence polarisation (FP), isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay (ALPHA-screen), radioligand binding or activity-based assays. Kinetic, thermodynamic and equilibrium binding data of a variety of cAMP derivatives to several cAMP binding domains were integrated in a single database system, we called KinetXBase, allowing for very distinct data formats. KineffBase is a practical data handling system for molecular interaction data of any kind, providing a synopsis of data derived from different technologies. This supports ongoing efforts in the bioinformatics community to devise formal concepts for a unified representation of interaction data, in order to enable their exchange and easy comparison. KinetXBase was applied here to analyse complex cAMP binding data and highly site-specific cAMP analogues could be identified. The software package is free for download by academic users.

A structure-activity relationship study demonstrated that for the studied set of aminoalkylindoles, the molecular dipole of the ground state conformation within the series was inversely related to the affinity. The racemic ligand with highest affinity (0.7 nM), 3-(4-fluoronaphthoyl)-1-(N-methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)indole, was radiolabeled with F-18. This radioligand specifically labeled CB, receptors in mouse brain and accumulated in regions of high versus low CB1 receptor density in a ratio of 1.6. The displaceable radioactivity of one enantiomer in the brains of mice determined in a pretreatment study using the CB, antagonist N-(piperidinyl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716) was nearly double that of the racemate for the same determination; therefore, the active enantiomer is a candidate for PET studies in animals. A pretreatement study for the other enantiomer found no displaceable radioactivity in the same group of mice; this result suggested the enantiomer was inactive.

A serotonin-dopamine interaction has been proposed to underlie this effect. Specifically, 5-HT1A receptor agonists may reduce the activity of serotonergic projections that inhibit dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurones, therefore increasing dorsal striatal dopamine levels and partially overcoming the neuroleptic blockade of D-2 receptors. We tested the hypothesis that 5-HT1A receptor agonists increase striatal dopamine release in man using PET scanning with the selective D2 receptor radioligand [C-11]raclopride, which is sensitive to endogenous dopamine levels. Six healthy volunteers received two PET scans, one after placebo, the other after 1 mg flesinoxan, a selective 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Binding potential values for striatal subdivisions were determined using a simplified reference tissue model. We did not find any difference in striatal [C-11]raclopride binding between conditions, even though flesinoxan lead to typical 5-HT1A receptor agonist side effects and produced elevation of growth hormone in five of the six subjects. Our results suggest that the anticataleptic effect of 5-HT1A receptor agonists is not mediated by striatal dopamine release, and indicates a need for further research with other suitable 5-HT1A receptor agonists.

To further refine this model, we investigated the biological activities of these neuropeptides in the crab Carcinus maenas , at the target tissue, receptor and cellular level by bioassay (inhibition of ecdysteroid synthesis), radioligand (receptor) binding assays, and second messenger (cGMP) assays, at defined stages of the moult cycle. To investigate possible moult cycle-related changes in neuropeptide biosynthesis, steady-state transcript levels of both neuropeptide mRNAs were measured by quantitative RT-PCR, and stored neuropeptide levels in the sinus gland were quantified during intermoult and premoult. The results show that the most important level of moult control lies within the signalling machinery of the target tissue, that expression and biosynthesis of both neuropeptides is constant during the moult cycle, and are not central to the currently accepted model of moult control.

The radioiodinated derivatives were stereoselectively formed by radioiododestannylation of the corresponding tributylstannyl precursors. The biodistribution of the novel [I-125]iodovinylestradiol derivatives was evaluated in immature female mice. Biological data indicated that the Z-isomer, owing to its higher in vivo uptake by the target tissue, has the preferable configuration for further development of similar compounds for estrogen receptor detection.

Here, ligand-binding kinetics of the full-length human adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) reconstituted in detergent micelles were measured using a fluorescently labeled ligand via fluorescence anisotropy. Importantly, to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio, these experiments were conducted in the ligand depletion regime. In the ligand depletion regime, the assumptions used to determine analytical solutions for one-site binding models for either one or two ligands in competition are no longer valid. We therefore implemented a numerical solution approach to analyze kinetic binding data as experimental conditions approach the ligand depletion regime. By comparing the results from the numerical and the analytical solutions, we highlight the ligand-receptor ratios at which the analytical solution begins to lose predictive accuracy. Using the numerical solution approach, we determined the kinetic rate constants of the fluorescent ligand, FITC-APEC, and those for three unlabeled ligands using competitive association experiments. The association and dissociation rate constants of the unlabeled ligands determined from the competitive association experiments were then independently validated using competitive dissociation data. Based on this study, a numerical solution is recommended to determine kinetic ligand-binding parameters for experiments conducted in the ligand-depletion regime.

Addictive behaviors may induce their reinforcing effects through stimulation of the brain dopaminergic mesolimbic pathway. The status of dopamine receptors in the brain may be parallel to their homologous receptors in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). Here, we have investigated the mRNA expression of dopamine D3, D4 and D5 receptors in PBLs of computer game addicts (n = 20) in comparison to normal subjects (n = 20), using a real-time PCR method. The results showed that the expression level of D3 and D4 dopamine receptors in computer game addicts were not statistically different from the control group. However, the expression of the mRNA of D5 dopamine receptor was significantly down-regulated in PBLs of computer game addicts and reached 0.42 the amount of the control group. It is concluded that unlike with drug addiction, the expression levels of the D3 and D4 dopamine receptors in computer game addicts are not altered compared to the control group. However, reduced level of the D5 dopamine receptor in computer game addicts may serve as a peripheral marker in studies where the confounding effects of abused drugs are unwanted.

The present finding reveals the potential of PUP (8-(furan-2-yl)-3-phenethylthiazolo[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine-2(3H)-thione) as novel and potent A(2A)R antagonist. In radioligand binding assay, IMP showed significantly high binding affinity (K-1 6.3 nM) and selectivity with A(2A)R (A(1)R/A(2A)R =4603) which was comparable to the results of docking analysis (K-i = 1.6 nM, Delta G = -14.52 Kcal/mol). MP antagonized (0.46 pmol/ml) the effect of NECA-induced increase in cAMP concentration (0.65 pmol/ml) better than SCH58261 (0.55 pmol/ml) in HEK293 T cells. Haloperidol and NECA-induced mice pre-treated with MP at 10 mg/kg showed attenuation in catalepsy and akinesia without significant neurotoxicity in rotarod test at 20 mg/kg. Essentially, novel compound demonstrated remarkable potential as A(2A)R antagonist in the therapy of PD. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our data show that, under the conditions used, [3H] pirenzepine binding was highly selective for the muscarinic M1 receptor whereas both [H-3] AF-DX 386 and [H-3]4DAMP had less discriminatory power. In addition, the data suggest that a marked decrease in [H-3] pirenzepine binding in BA 9 from a subset of people with schizophrenia is predictive of decreases in muscarinic receptors in other CNS regions. However, there were some region-specific decreases in muscarinic receptors in tissue from people with schizophrenia who were outside this subset. These data add to a growing body of evidence suggesting there are widespread decreases in muscarinic receptors in the CNS of some subjects with schizophrenia, as demonstrated by neuroimaging. Our data have implications for understanding the potential clinical utility of drugs directed at the orthosteric and allosteric sites of muscarinic receptors to treat schizophrenia.

An online analytical method coupling prostate cell membrane chromatography (CMC) with high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) was established to screen alpha(1A)-AR antagonists in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). The prostate cell membrane stationary phase (CMSP) was prepared by immobilizing the prostate cell membrane onto the surface of the silica carrier. The surface and chromatographic characteristics of the prostate CMSP were studied using tamsulosin as a model molecule. The retained fractions from the prostate CMC were analyzed by transferring them to an LC/MS system through a 10-port switch valve. The active component, which could act on the prostate cell membrane and receptor on it (such as alpha(1A)-AR), was determined using a displacement experiment. The results indicated that liensinine, isoliensine, and neferine from Lotus Plumule exhibited similar retention characteristics to the control drug tamsulosin when utilizing the prostate CMC model. This new prostate CMC-LC/MS method is applicable for screening alpha(1A)-AR antagonists from TCMs such as Lotus Plumule and could be employed as a drug discovery tool for natural medicinal herbs.

They participate in vital processes, including memory and learning, neuroplasticity, and neuroprotection in Alzheimer's disease. However, the mechanisms behind those effects remain to be elucidated. The neurosteroids pregnenolone sulphate (PS) and pregnanolone sulphate (3 beta 5 beta S) have recently been shown to allosterically alter the NMDA receptor in nanomolar concentrations. Those studies featured ifenprodil, which is a dirty drug, with affinity to many targets. In this study we compare the NMDA receptors in the hippocampus to recombinant NMDA receptors, using [H-3]-MK-801 as radioligand. The results show that neurosteroids modulate the ifenprodil binding kinetics in a narrow concentration interval, addressing it to the NR2B subunit, since no effects were recorded at recombinant NR1/NR2A receptors. The effects were also seen as changes in the manner ifenprodil displaced or induced the dissociation of [H-3]-MK-801. It indicates that the neurosteroidal effects indeed alter the ion pore of the NMDA receptor, why it is reasonable to believe that these findings have physiological relevance.

It is assumed to increase feeding by binding at growth hormone secretagogue receptors (GHS-R), the only sites of action for this gastric hormone identified to date. Initially, the distribution of ghrelin binding sites could only be determined from expression patterns of GHS-R mRNA or the use of immunohistochemical techniques to examine c-fos expression. However, the characterisation of a novel radioligand ([I-125-his(9)]-ghrelin), has enabled the distribution of GHS-R receptor protein to be directly demonstrated. Here, using quantitative autoradiography, we investigate the distribution and density of ghrelin receptors in the rodent hypothalamus. Specific binding was identified in the appetite-regulating arcuate nucleus, ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular nucleus, dorsomedial. hypothalamic nucleus and the lateral hypothalamic area corresponding to the previously reported distribution pattern of GHS-R mRNA. Surprisingly, variations in receptor density were not identified in any of these binding sites upon a change in nutritional status, despite relevant alterations in plasma ghrelin levels being identified. We suggest that this may relate to the paradigm employed to modify nutritional status in the study or could indicate that peripheral ghrelin is unlikely to be the major source of ghrelin that acts in many hypothalamic sites.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Noni fruit on anxiety symptoms in vitro. To this end, a competitive GABAa receptor-binding assay was developed. Our preliminary study indicates that the methanol crude extract of Noni fruit showed significant affinity to the gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABAa) inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors, and displayed 75% binding inhibition of the agonist radioligand [H-3] muscimol at a concentration of 100 mu g/ml. Further experiments demonstrated that the MeOH extract, and its BuOH and H2O partitions, exhibited IC50 values of 22.8, 27.2, and 17.1 mu g/ml, respectively, in the GABAa-binding assay. Experimental results with Noni fruit indicate the presence of competitive ligand(s), which may bind to the GABAa receptor as an agonist, and thus induce its anxiolytic and sedative effects. The study provides an in vitro rationale for one of Noni's versatile and traditional uses. In addition, an HPLC fingerprint profile of the methanolic extract of Nom fruit has been established for quality control purpose. Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Loss of glutamine synthetase in the human epileptic hippocampus: possible mechanism for raised extracellular glutamate in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Lancet 363, 28-37]. Glutamine synthetase activity was equivalent in both non-epileptic and epileptic human neocortex. Epileptic tissue, however, was characterised by a 37% increase in the density of synaptosomal NMDA receptor sites compared to non-epileptic tissue, as revealed by a radioligand binding assay (Bmax(non-epileptic) 1.45 pmol/mg protein and B-max(epileptic) 1.99 pmol/mg protein, P < 0.05). Our findings shed some doubts on a role of glutamine synthetase in the pathophysiology of epilepsy in the neocortex. However, the detection of a significantly reduced enzymatic activity in the epileptic amygdala supports the assumption that the enzyme defect is localized to the epileptic mesial temporal lobe of corresponding patients.

At baseline, Scatchard analyses revealed that the higher [C-11]raclopride binding found tinder halothane anesthesia was mainly attributable to a higher radioligand apparent affinity. Decreased [C-11]raclopride binding was demonstrated following amphetamine tinder ketamine but not tinder halothane anesthesia. Under ketamine anesthesia transient DA overflows induced by direct stimulations of DA neurons through an intracerebral electrode induced transient changes in [C-11]raclopride binding with a remarkable spatiotemporal accuracy. No effect was observed tinder halothane anesthesia. The failure to detect competition between DA and [C-11]raclopride for binding on D-2-receptors tinder halothane anesthesia might reflect, as already reported for other brain receptor systems, a halothane-promoted conversion of D2-receptors to a state of lower affinity for DA. It is suggested that the affinity state of receptors is a factor to be considered in in vivo ligand-activation studies. (C) 2002 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

Otenzepad, in combination with C-7/3 ' -phth or gallamine, gave concentration-ratios close to additive and in agreement with theoretical model predictions for combination of two allosteric modulators acting at a common site. However, when otenzepad was combined with alcuronium, dexetimide or N-methylscopolamine, supra-additive effects were observed. For either competitive antagonist in combination with otenzepad, the degree of supra-additivity was more evident after 2-h equilibration than alter 40 min. When otenzepad was combined ru-im atropine, no supra-additivity was observed with carbachol as the agonist, but was evident with acetylcholine. Otenzepad was also unable to fully inhibit [H-3]N-methylscopolamine binding when the radioligand was employed at a concentration of similar to 100 X K-D. It is concluded that the action of otenzepad involves an allosteric site and a number of possibilities are discussed for its location. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

KMUP 880708 (0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg kg(-1), iv) produced dose-dependent hypotensive and bradycardia responses in pentobarbital-anesthetized Wistar rats. KMUP 880708 (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg kg-1, iv) also markedly inhibited both the tachycardia effects induced by (-)isoproterenol and arterial pressor responses induced by phenylephrine. KMUP 880708 competitively antagonized (-)isoproterenol-induced positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of the atria and tracheal relaxation responses on isolated guinea pig tissues. The apparent pA(2) values for KMUP 880708 was 7.82 +/- 0.06 in the right atria, 7.51 +/- 0.13 in the left atria, and 6.31 +/- 0.07 in the trachea, respectively, indicating that KMUP 880708 was selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocker. In thoracic aorta experiments, KMUP 880708 also produced a competitive antagonism of norepinephrine-induced contraction with pA(2) value of 7.92 +/- 0.52, indicating that KMUP 880708 was a-adrenoceptor antagonist. In isolated rat thoracic aorta, KMUP 880708 more potently relaxed the contractions induced by phenylephrine (10(-5) M) than those by high K+ (75 mM). KMUP 880708-induced relaxation was significantly reduced by endothelium removal and by exposure to L-N-G-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 1 and 3 x 10(-4) M), indomethacin (3 x 10(-5) M), methylene blue (10-5 M) and 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolol[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ, 10(-6) M). The vasorelaxant effect of KMUP 880708 on phenylephrine-induced contraction was attenuated by the pretreatment with tetraethylammonium (TEA), glibenclamide, charybdotoxin, and apamin, but not by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). In addition, KMUP 880708 inhibited phenylephrine-induced biphasic contraction and affected the fast-twitch phase more significantly than the slow tonic phase. In the radioligand-binding assay, the K-i values of [H-3]CGP-12177 binding to rat ventricle and lung membranes were 15.14 and 524.81 nM, respectively, and the value of [H-3]prazosin binding to rat brain membrane was 3.89 nM. The ranking order of inhibition for [H-3]CGP-12177 binding on beta-adrenoceptor was propranolol > labetalol > KMUP 880708 > atenolol, and that for [H-3]prazosin binding to alpha-adrenoceptor was KMUP 880708 > labetalol. In conclusion, KMUP 880708 was found to be a new generation alpha/beta-adrenoceptor blocker with selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocking and vascular smooth muscle relaxation activities. Furthermore, the vasodilator effect of KMUP 880708 is attributed to the release of NO or NO-related substance from vascular endothelium. While the endothelium-in dependent mechanism involved in the relaxation of KMUP 880708 is probably linked to K+ channel activation in these vessels. Drug Dev. Res. 55:104-117,2002.

Improved radiosynthesis was developed according to the previously reported P2X7R antagonist GSK1482160. Biodistribution, radiometabolite, and dynamic positron emission tomography/computed tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (PET/CT-MRI) of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) rat model and the transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) revealed a stable, low uptake of [F-18]4A in the brain of healthy rats but a higher standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in LPS-treated rats (1.316 +/- 0.062, n = 3) than in sham (1.093 +/- 0.029, n = 3). There were higher area under curves (AUCs) in the neocortex (25.12 +/- 1.11 vs 18.94 +/- 1.47), hippocampus (22.50 +/- 3.41 vs 15.90 +/- 1.59), and basal ganglia (22.26 +/- 0.81 vs 15.32 +/- 1.76) of AD mice (n = 3) than the controls (n = 3) (p < 0.05). Furthermore, 50 min dynamic PET in healthy nonhuman primates (NHPs) indicated [F-18]4A could penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In conclusion, [F-18]4A from this study is a potent P2X7R PET tracer that warrants further neuroinflammation quantification in human studies.

Yet, therapeutic and diagnostic applications thereof are hampered by the lack of subtype selective ligands. Within this work, we synthesized and chemically characterized three different stereoisomers of hydrobenzoin esters of arecaidine by NMR, HR-MS, chiral chromatography, and HPLC-logP. All compounds are structurally eligible for carbon-11 labeling and show appropriate stability in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and F12 cell culture medium. A competitive radioligand binding assay on Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes comprising the human mAChR subtypes M1-M5 showed the highest orthosteric binding affinity for subtype M1 and a strong influence of stereochemistry on binding affinity, which corresponds to in silico molecular docking experiments. K-i values toward M1 were determined as 99 +/- 19 nM, 800 +/- 200 nM, and 380 +/- 90 nM for the (R,R)-, (S,S)-, and racemic (R,S)-stereoisomer, respectively, highlighting the importance of stereochemical variations in mAChR ligand development. All three stereoisomers were shown to act as antagonists toward mAChR M1 using a Fluo-4 calcium efflux assay. With respect to future positron emission tomography (PET) tracer development, the (R,R)-isomer appears especially promising as a lead structure due to its highest subtype selectivity and lowest K-i value.

Herein, the selective 5-HT1A/7 antagonist, modified for enhanced brain permeation, is developed as a homobivalent ligand, (6-AcBTZ) (2)DTPA. After in-depth computational studies to probe the binding mechanism, two-step synthesis lead to (6-AcBTZ)(2)DTPA. Biocompatibility studies indicated cytocompatibility with 3.6-1.64% cell death (0.1 mM-1 pM) and hemocompatibility with 2.33% hemolysis of human erythrocytes. When Tc-99m-radiolabeled in a quantitative yield (98%), a stable preparation was obtained with 7.4 and 3.5% dissociation upon incubation with human serum and excess cysteine. The single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer Tc-99m-(6-AcBTZ)(2)DTPA showed biphasic clearance (t(1/2), (distribution) = 0.5 min and t(1/2), (elimination) = 482 min) and maximum brain uptake of 0.42 +/- 0.02% ID/g with the regional localization (hippocampus: 11.38% ID/g; cortex: 26.42% ID/g; cerebellum: 25.23% ID/g). Thus, the Tc-99m-metal-based SPECT neurotracer holds potential for neuroreceptor mapping.

Their roles as potential positron emission tomography (PET) ligands were evaluated, as well as their inhibitory potency toward PDE10A and other PDEs, and their metabolic stability was determined in vitro. According to our findings, haloalkyl substituents at position 2 of the quinazoline moiety and/or halo-alkyloxy substituents at positions 6 or 7 affect not only the compounds' affinity, but also their selectivity toward PDE10A. As a result of substituting the methoxy group for a monofluoroethoxy or difluoroethoxy group at position 6 of the quinazoline ring, the selectivity for PDE10A over PDE3A increased. The same result was obtained by 6,7-difluoride substitution on the quinoxaline moiety. Finally, fluorinated compounds (R)-7-(fluoromethoxy)-6-methoxy-4-(3-(quinoxaline-2-yloxy) pyrrolidine-1-yl)quinazoline (16a), 19a-d, (R)-tert-butyl-3(6-fluoroquinoxalin-2-yloxy)pyrrolidine-1-carboxylate (29), and 35 (IC50 PDE10A 11-65 nm) showed the highest inhibitory potential.

This tracer has replaced In-111 pentetreotide (OctreoScan (R)) for somatostatin receptor scintigraphy at our laboratory. Methods: Fifty of our first 74 PET/CT examinations with Ga-68-DOTA-TOC could be evaluated in retrospect. None of these patients had surgery or showed any pathology in the pancreas head at the concomitant CT. Results: Thirty-five of the 50 examinations (70%) showed an uptake by the uncinate process sufficiently intense to be interpreted as pathologic and simulating a tumor. Mean SUVmax was 9.2. Mean SUVmean using an isoactivity cut-off of >75% and >50% was 7.8 and 6.0, respectively. Volume calculations of the uncinate process activity using these definitions gave 0.9 mL and 4.2 mL, respectively. Conclusion: There is a frequent physiological uptake of Ga-68-DOTA-TOC by the pancreas uncinate process. This may be caused by an accumulation of pancreatic polypeptide-containing cells expressing somatostatin receptors. If there is a normal finding at concomitant diagnostic CT, this uptake should be regarded as physiological.

However, this technology is still nascent and has not yet achieved the status of "high throughput" or laid claim to handling a large set of receptors. In addition, the technology has been demonstrated only when using fluorescent ligands to detect binding, limiting its application to a subset of GPCRs. To expand the impact of multiplexing on this receptor class, we have developed a radiometric approach to the microarray assay. In these studies, we considered two receptors in the alpha-adrenergic receptor family, alpha 2A and alpha 2C, and the I-125-labeled agonist clonidine. We demonstrate that microarrays of these receptors can be readily detected (signal/noise ratio similar to 160) using a Typhoon 9210 PhosphorImager. In addition, biochemical characterization shows that ligand-binding profiles and selectivity are preserved with the selective antagonists BRL44408 and ARC239. Importantly, these microarrays use approximately 200- to 400-fold less membrane preparation required by conventional assay methods and allow two or more receptors to be assayed in an area equivalent to a standard well of a microtiter plate. The impact of this approach on screening in drug discovery is discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In vitro quantitative binding studies using AD brain tissue homogenates showed that the dibenzothiazole derivatives displayed high binding affinities with K-i values in the nanomolar range (6.8-36 nM). These derivatives are relatively lipophilic with partition coefficients (logP oct) in the range of 1.25-3.05. Preliminary structure-activity relationship studies indicated dibenzothiazole derivatives bearing electron-donating groups exhibited higher binding affinities than those bearing electron-withdrawing groups. A lead compound was selected for its high binding affinity and radiolabeled with [I-125] through direct radioiodination using sodium [I-125] iodide in the presence of Chloramine T. The radioligand (4-[2,6']dibenzothiazolyl-2'-yl-2-[I-125]-phenylamine) displayed moderate lipophilicity (logP oct, 2.70), very good brain uptake (3.71 +/- 0.63% ID/g at 2 min after iv injection in mice), and rapid washout from normal brains (0.78% and 0.43% ID/g at 30 and 60 min, respectively). These studies indicated that lipophilic dibenzothiazole derivatives represent a promising pharmacophore for the development of novel amyloid-imaging agents for potential application in Alzheimer's disease and related neurodegenerative disorders.

Nude mice bearing HEC-1A, RL-95-2 and AN3CA tumours were treated with AN-215 and its cytotoxic radical (AN-201). The BN receptor expression in tumours was followed by RT-PCR analysis and radioligand binding assays. Expression of drug resistance proteins MDR-1, MRP-1 and BCRP were measured by realtime PCR. AN-215 significantly (P<0.05) inhibited the growth of HEC-1A, RL-95-2 and AN3CA tumours while AN-201 was ineffective. The expression of BN receptors was demonstrated in all three tumour models. AN-215 caused a lower induction of MDR-1 in HEC-1A and RL-95-2 cancers than AN-201. MRP-1 and BCRP were not induced by AN-215 or AN-201. Thus, targeted chemotherapy with AN-215 powerfully inhibits the growth of human BN receptor-positive endometrial cancers. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The binding was studied using a radioligand binding assay. It was found that the membrane phospholipid composition and methylation of the acyl side chain of TCA has a decisive effect on participation of particular noncovalent interactions in the binding. Apparent high-affinity binding of TCAs to the phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine membranes are achieved mainly by incorporation of uncharged drug molecules into the hydrophobic core of the bilayers. Van der Waals forces and hydrophobic effect are responsible for this binding. Both charged and uncharged drug molecules bind to phosphatidylserine membranes, therefore coulomb- or ion-induced dipole interactions play a role in these binding. Different spatial distribution of charged residues within the interface causes different electrostatic interactions between charged TCAs and vesicles formed from phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylinositol. The data supports the hypothesis under which TCAs could have effect on affective disorders partially via binding to the lipid part of the membrane and following changes of lipid-protein interactions.

Administration of [H-3]methoxy-PEPy (50 muCi/kg i.v.) to mGlu5 receptor-deficient mice revealed binding at background levels in forebrain, whereas wild-type mice exhibited 14-fold higher binding in forebrain relative to cerebellum. Systemic administration of the mGlu5 receptor antagonists 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) and 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl]pyridine (MTEP) reduced the binding of [H-3]methoxy-PEPy in rats and mice, reflecting mGlu5 receptor occupancy by these compounds. MPEP (10 mg/kg i.p.) and MTEP (3 mg/kg i.p.) maintained >75% receptor occupancy for 2 h in rats, while in mice MPEP and MTEP achieved >75% occupancy for only 30 and 15 min, respectively. Compound levels in plasma were substantially lower in mice suggesting species differences in receptor occupancy result from differences in absorption or metabolism of the compounds. These findings demonstrate that [H-3]methoxy-PEPy is useful for determining the occupancy of mGlu5 receptors in the brain. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A C-terminal extension of 13 residues that is specifically recognized by the Escherichia coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase (Bir A) was fused to a truncated NS3 protease domain, allowing the efficient production of in vivo biotinylated protease. This enzyme was purified and shown to have the same properties as its wild-type counterpart concerning substrate binding and turnover, interaction with a cofactor peptide, and inhibition by three different classes of inhibitors. Immobilization of the biotinylated protease, using streptavidin-coated scintillation proximity beads, allowed detection, by scintillation counting, of its interaction with a tritiated active site ligand spanning the whole substrate binding site of the protease from P6 to P4'. Immobilization did not measurably affect accessibility to either the active site or the cofactor binding site of the protease as judged by the unchanged affinities for a cofactor peptide and for two active site binders. Using the displacement of the radioligand as readout, we were able to set up a rapid, robust, and fully automated assay, suitable for the selective identification of novel active site ligands of the NS3 protease.

The effector coupling of human A(3) adenosine receptors expressed in such a cellular model was characterized. Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase via a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein was confirmed and exhibited a pharmacological profile in accordance with agonist binding data. The agonist potency was dependent on the assay system utilized to measure cyclase inhibition. Agonists were more potent in a cell-based assay than in experiments where cyclase inhibition was measured in a membrane preparation suggesting that receptor-effector coupling might be more efficient in intact cells. In addition to the modulation of cyclase activity, stimulation of A(3) receptors elicited a Ca2+ response in CHO cells with agonist potencies corresponding to the values for the whole cell cAMP assay. The Ca2+ signal was completely eliminated by pertussis toxin treatment suggesting that it is mediated via betagamma release from a heterotrimeric G protein of the G(i/o) family.

The role of the C-terminus of the receptor was investigated by examining the C-terminally truncated or point-mutated mu opioid receptors in receptor phosphorylation and desensitization. Both wild-type and mutated receptors were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The receptor expression was confirmed by receptor radioligand binding and immunoblotting. After exposure to 5 mu M of DAMGO, phosphorylation of the C-terminally truncated receptor and the mutant receptor T394A was reduced to 30 and 10% of that of the wild-type receptor, respectively. Mutation effects on agonist-induced desensitization were studied using adenylyl cyclase inhibition assays. The C-terminally truncated receptor and mutant receptor T394A both showed complete loss of DAMGO-induced desensitization, while the mutant T/S-7A receptor only lost part of its ability to desensitize. Taken together, these results suggest that the C-terminus of the mu opioid receptor participates in receptor phosphorylation and desensitization with threonine 394, a crucial residue for both features. DAMGO-induced mu opioid receptor phosphorylation and desensitization are associated and appear to involve both the mu opioid receptor C-terminus and other domains of the receptor.

F-18-FE-PE2I is a suitable PET radioligand for DAT quantification and imaging with good pharmacokinetics. The aim of this study was to determine a clinical optimal simplified reference tissue-based image acquisition protocol and to compare the discriminatory value and effect size for F-18-FE-PE2I to that for I-123-FP-CIT scan currently used in clinical practice. Methods Nine patients with early Parkinson's disease (PD, 64.3 +/- 6.8 years, 3M), who had previously undergone a I-123-FP-CIT scan as part of their diagnostic workup, and 34 healthy volunteers (HV, 47.7 +/- 16.8 years, 13M) underwent a 60-min dynamic F-18-FE-PE2I PET-MR scan on a GE Signa 3T PET-MR. Based on dynamic data and MR-based VOI delineation, BPND, semi-quantitative uptake ratio and SUVR[t1-t2] images were calculated using either occipital cortex or cerebellum as reference region. For start-and-end time of the SUVR interval, three time frames [t(1)-t(2)] were investigated: [15-40] min, [40-60] min, and [50-60] min postinjection. Data for putamen (PUT) and caudate nucleus-putamen ratio (CPR) were compared in terms of quantification bias versus BPND and discriminative power. Results Using occipital cortex as reference region resulted in smaller bias of SUVR with respect to BPND + 1 and higher correlation between SUVR and BPND + 1 compared with using cerebellum, irrespective of SUVR [t(1)-t(2)] interval. Smallest bias was observed with the [15-40]-min time window, in accordance with previous literature. The correlation between BPND + 1 and SUVR was slightly better for the late time windows. Discriminant analysis between PD and HV using both PUT and CPR SUVRs showed an accuracy of >= 90%, for both reference regions and all studied time windows. Semi-quantitative I-123-FP-CIT and F-18-FE-PE2I values and relative decrease in the striatum for patients were highly correlated, with a higher effect size for F-18-FE-PE2I for PUT and CPR SUVR. Conclusion F-18-FE-PE2I is a suitable radioligand for in vivo DAT imaging with high discriminative power between early PD and healthy controls. Whereas a [15-40]-min window has lowest bias with respect to BPND, a [50-60]-min time window at pseudoequilibrium can be advocated in terms of clinical feasibility with optimal discriminative power. The occipital cortex may be slightly preferable as reference region because of the higher time stability, stronger correlation of SUVR with BPND + 1, and lower bias. Moreover, the data suggest that the diagnostic accuracy of a 10-min static F-18-FE-PE2I scan is non-inferior compared with I-123-FP-CIT scan used in standard clinical practice.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new strategies for the treatment of HCC. TMTP1 (NVVRQ) is a tumor-homing peptide that has been shown to target a range of highly metastatic tumor cells. In this study, a novel radiotherapeutic probe, [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-EB-TMTP1, was synthesized and used to explore the antitumor efficacy in an HCC tumor model. The albumin-binding TMTP1 radioligand was achieved with > 98% radiochemical purity. Long tumor retention property of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-EB-TMTP1 was exhibited in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and biodistribution study. The [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-EB-TMTP1 showed significant accumulation in the SMMC-7721 HCC tumor with an uptake value of 9.67 +/- 1.27 %ID/g at 8 h and a T/M ratio of 6.4. In radiotherapy studies, 30 days after injection of [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-EB-TMTP1, the tumor inhibition rate reached 93.2 +/- 0.10 and 94.9 +/- 0.04% in the 18.5 and 29.6 MBq high-dose groups, respectively. These preclinical data suggest that [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-EB-TMTP1 may be an effective treatment option for HCC and should be further evaluated in human trials.

It is marked by progressive neurodegeneration that has long been known to impact dopaminergic cells and circuits, but more recently the acetylcholine system has also been implicated in the complex aetiology and symptomatology of the disease. While broad changes in cholinergic markers have been described, insight into the contribution of specific acetylcholine receptors is less clear. To address this important unknown, in this study we performed [H-3] pirenzepine, [H-3] 4DAMP, and [H-3] AF-DX 384 in situ radioligand binding on postmortem tissues from Brodmann's area 6, 9, 46, and the caudate putamen, from PD and matched controls to detect muscarinic M1, M3, and M1/2/4 receptors, respectively. We found no difference in [H-3] pirenzepine binding between PD and controls across all regions assessed. [H-3] 4DAMP binding was found to be higher in PD CPu and BA9 than in controls. [H-3] AF-DX 384 was higher in BA9 of PD compared with controls. In sum, we show selective increase in M3 receptors in cortical and subcortical regions, as well as increased M2/M4 in cortical area BA9, which together support a role for cholinergic dysfunction in PD.

MGAT2 is important for intestinal lipid absorption and is an emerging target for the treatment of metabolic diseases. In the current study, we identified and characterized four classes of novel MGAT2 inhibitors. We established both steady state and kinetic binding assay protocols using a novel radioligand, [H-3]compound A. Diverse chemotypes of MGAT2 inhibitors were found to compete binding of [H-3]compound A to MGAT2, indicating the broad utility of [H-3]compound A for testing various classes of MGAT2 inhibitors. In the dynamic binding assays, the kinetic values of MGAT2 inhibitors such as K-on, K-off, and T-1/2 were systematically defined. Of particular value, the residence times of inhibitors on MGAT2 enzyme were derived. We believe that the identification of novel classes of MGAT2 inhibitors and the detailed kinetic characterization provide valuable information for the identification of superior candidates for in vivo animal and clinical studies. The current work using a chemical probe to define inhibitory kinetics can be broadly applied to other membrane-bound acyltransferases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Cellular localization and adaptive changes of the cardiac delta opioid receptor system in an experimental model of heart failure in rats	HEART AND VESSELS			English	Article						Aortocaval fistula; Heart failure; Delta opioid receptor; Proenkephalin	CHRONIC VOLUME OVERLOAD; K-ATP CHANNELS; BETA-ENDORPHIN; INFLAMMATORY PAIN; PEPTIDE RECEPTOR; MYOCYTES; DOGS; COMPONENTS; EXPRESSION; ENKEPHALIN	The role of the cardiac opioid system in congestive heart failure (CHF) is not fully understood. Therefore, this project investigated the cellular localization of delta opioid receptors (DOR) in left ventricle (LV) myocardium and adaptive changes in DOR and its endogenous ligand, the precursor peptide proenkephalin (PENK), during CHF. Following IRB approval, DOR localization was determined by radioligand binding using [H-3]Naltrindole and by double immunofluorescence confocal analysis in the LV of male Wistar rats. Additionally, 28 days following an infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) the extent of CHF and adaptions in left ventricular DOR and PENK expression were examined by hemodynamic measurements, RT-PCR, and Western blot. DOR specific membrane binding sites were identified in LV myocardium. DOR were colocalized with L-type Ca2+-channels (Ca(v)1.2) as well as with intracellular ryanodine receptors (RyR) of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum. Following ACF severe congestive heart failure developed in all rats and was accompanied by up-regulation of DOR and PENK on mRNA as well as receptor proteins representing consecutive adaptations.

The present study was designed to screen and identify the antidepressant-like effect of six triterpenoid saponin components derived from Yuanzhi (Yuanzhi-1 to Yuanzhi-6) using in vitro radioligand receptor binding assays and in vivo behavioral tests. Yuanzhi-1, -3, -5 and -6 were shown to have antidepressant-like activity in the tail suspension test and forced swim test in mice, with no stimulant effect on locomotor activity. The minimal effective dose of Yuanzhi-1 (2.5 mg/kg) was lower than that of duloxetine (5 mg/kg), a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor commonly used in the treatment of depression. Yuanzhi-1 (1 nM) had a high affinity for serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine transporters. Acute toxicity tests indicated that the LD50 of Yuanzhi-1 (86.5 mg/kg) was similar to that of duloxetine (73.2 mg/kg). These findings demonstrate that Yuanzhi-1 has a potential to be a novel triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor of antidepressant-like activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, we show here that M1-mAChRs are also highly expressed on intracellular membranes in neurons of the telencephalon and activate signaling cascades distinct from those of cell surface receptors, contributing uniquely to synaptic plasticity. Radioligand-binding experiments with cell-permeable and -impermeable ligands and immunohistochemical observations revealed intracellular and surface distributions of M1-mAChRs in the hippocampus and cortex of rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the selective occurrence on the cell surface in other tissues. All intracellular muscarinic-binding sites were abolished in M1-mAChR-gene-knockout mice. Activation of cell surface M1-mAChRs in rat hippocampal neurons evoked phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis and network oscillations at theta rhythm, and transiently enhanced long-term potentiation. On the other hand, activation of intracellular M1-mAChRs phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2 and gradually enhanced long-term potentiation. Our data thus demonstrate that M1-mAChRs function at both surface and intracellular sites in telencephalon neurons including the hippocampus, suggesting a new mode of cholinergic transmission in the central nervous system.

The rate of dissociation of [H-3]QNB was affected in a bell-shaped manner with at least one Hill coefficient (n(H)) greater than 1, indicating that at least three allosteric sites are involved. The level of binding of [H-3]QNB was decreased in a biphasic manner, revealing at least two allosteric sites; binding of [H-3]NMS was affected in a triphasic, serpentine manner, revealing at least three sites, and values of n(H) >1 pointed to at least four sites. Several lines of evidence indicate that all effects of gallamine were allosteric in nature and could be observed at equilibrium. The rates of equilibration and dissociation suggest that the receptor was predominately oligomeric, and the heterogeneity revealed by gallamine can be attributed to differences in its affinity for the constituent protomers of a tetramer. Those differences appear to arise from inter- and intramolecular cooperativity between gallamine and the radioligand.

Hippocampal α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor levels in patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder	BIPOLAR DISORDERS			English	Article						alpha 7 nicotinic receptor; bipolar disorder; bungarotoxin; major depressive disorder; schizophrenia; temporal lobe	DUPLICATED REGION; MESSENGER-RNA; CHRNA7 GENE; ASSOCIATION; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; RIC-3; SUBUNIT; BINDING; DONEPEZIL	Background: The alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR) is involved in cognitive function and synaptic plasticity. Consequently, changes in a7 nAChR function have been implicated in a variety of mental disorders, especially schizophrenia. However, there is little knowledge regarding the levels of the a7 nAChR in patients with bipolar disorder. Methods: We performed [125 I]-bungarotoxin autoradiography to selectively visualize and measure a7 nAChRs on postmortem sections of the temporal lobe from patients with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depressive disorder, as well as control subjects. Radioligand binding was determined in the dentate gyrus, CA3, and CA1 subfields of the hippocampus and the perirhinal cortex. Results: Bungarotoxin binding was significantly increased in the CA1 and perirhinal cortex of patients with bipolar disorder compared to control subjects, whereas in patients with schizophrenia or major depressive disorder the level of binding did not significantly differ from control subjects in any region measured. Conclusions: These data are consistent with the reported genetic associations linking the a7 nAChR to the pathology of bipolar disorder, and may suggest a dysfunction of a7 nAChR-dependent signalling in bipolar disorder. We could not reproduce the previously reported decrease in hippocampal bungarotoxin binding in schizophrenia.

UDP-Glc has been previously shown to activate human P2Y14, whereas UDP was unable to activate the receptor. In this study, the authors used conventional and nonconventional methods to further characterize P2Y14 and its ligands. Conventional calcium mobilization and nonconventional cellular impedance functional assays revealed that UMP and UDP selectively activated HEK cells coexpressing P2Y14 and G alpha(qi5). In the impedance assays, the presence of exogenous G alpha(qi5) resulted in agonist-induced Gq signaling, whereas in the absence of exogenous G alpha(qi5), the signal was indicative of Gi. The authors established the first P2Y14 membrane filtration binding assay using a novel optimized expression vector and [H-3]UDP as radioligand. UDP-Glc, UMP, and UDP dose dependently inhibited [3H] UDP binding in the binding assay, and saturation analysis revealed that UDP bound P2Y14 with a K-D = 10 nM and a B-max = 110 pmol/mg. The authors screened a phosphonate library and identified compound A, which inhibited UDP-Glc-mediated calcium signaling in the fluorometric imaging plate reader assay (IC50 = 2.3 mu M) and competed for [H-3]UDP binding in the novel binding assay with a K-i = 1280 nM.

The in vivo binding potentials of [C-11]raclopride, a D-2 receptor antagonist, were determined in male CD-1 rats under five conditions: (1) drug-naive with saline challenge, (2) drug naive with 5 mg/kg amphetamine challenge, (3) amphetamine-dosed (five daily repeated s.c. doses of 5 mg/kg amphetamine) and saline challenge, (4) amphetamine-dosed and amphetamine challenge, and (5) saline treated (five daily repeated s.c. doses) and saline challenged. Radiotracer studies in amphetamine-dosed animals were done after a 10-day drug free interval. In the amphetamine-dosed group the baseline [C-11]raclopride binding was increased by 63% compared to saline-treated controls.

Pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines belong to a class of inhibitors, which bind with high affinity to CDK4 and CDK6. 1-(3-[F-18]Fluoropropyl)-4-(4-nitrophenyl)piperazine and 1-(3-[F-18]fluoropropyl)-4-(6-nitropyridin-3-yl)piperazine represent structural elements of the appropriate CDK inhibitors and were therefore chosen as model compounds for the incorporation of fluorine-18 into pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines. Three methods are known for the preparation of tertiary 3-[F-18]fluoropropyl-amines: 1) the direct substitution of a good leaving group, 2) the two-step reaction synthesizing a 3-[F-18]fluoropropyl intermediate, and 3) the utilization of aziridinium or azetidinium salts. In general, radiofluorinations using azetidinium salts lead to excellent radiochemical yields in short periods of time. For these reasons, we developed a synthesis route to tosylated piperazine precursors and established a radiolabeling approach based on the incorporation of fluorine-18 into open-chained tosylates as well as the respective azetidinium spiro compounds to yield the desired radiofluorinated piperazines successfully.

The synthesis comprises a hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of imines with Danishefsky's diene (3), followed by a Lewis acid catalyzed conjugate reduction of the resulting dihydropyrid ones and hydrogenolytic debenzylation. The required aldehydes were synthesized by transacetalization of benzophenone dimethyl acetal (8) with pentane-1,3,5-triol (7), butane-1,2,4-triol (15), and 4-benzyloxybutane-1,3-diol (31), respectively, and subsequent Swern oxidation. Homodexoxadrols 39 were synthesized by the Cagliotti method with the use of p-toluenesulfonylhydrazide and NaBH4 for the removal of the oxo group. The diastereomers were separated and the relative configuration was assigned by X-ray crystal structure analysis and comparison of spectroscopic and chromatographic data. Receptor binding studies with the radioligand [H-3]-(+)-MK-801 demonstrated that an expanded O-heterocycle, an enlarged distance between the heterocycles, and an additional oxo group led to a considerable loss of affinity towards the phencyclidine binding site of the NMDA receptor.

Recent studies in rats indicate profound effects on serotonin (5HT) systems that originate during CPF exposure and that are still present at 2 months posttreatment in the young adult. To determine if these changes are permanent, we administered 1 mg/kg of CPF daily to neonatal rats on postnatal days 1-4, a regimen devoid of systemic toxicity, and examined 5HT synaptic markers at 5 months of age: radioligand binding to 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2) receptors and to the 5HT transporter. There were global elevations in all three synaptic proteins, with pronounced sex selectivity (effects on males > females) and a regional hierarchy of effects, viz. striatum > midbrain approximate to brainstern > cerebral cortex. Because there is a normal sex disparity for 5HT synaptic proteins, with females having higher values than males, the increase caused by CPF exposure in males completely eliminated this difference. Our findings at 5 months of age replicate those seen in young adulthood and strongly suggest that the effects of neonatal CPF exposure on 5HT systems are permanent. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Endothelin-A (ETA) receptors were visualized by ligand binding and autoradiography to the renal vasculature throughout the cortex and medulla, including the large arcuate arteries, adjacent veins and arterioles. Lower binding densities were visualized to the vasa recta and glomeruli. A similar pattern of staining was revealed by ETA selective antisera, with the higher resolution demonstrating ETA receptors confined to smooth muscle cells. Staining was also detected to the vasa recta and glomeruli. Ligand binding revealed a more heterogeneous endothelin-B (ETB) receptor distribution with high densities concentrated in the medulla. Three different site-directed ETB antisera demonstrated a similar pattern of staining to the endothelium lining all renal vessels but not to the smooth muscle. Staining was also detected to glomerular endothelial cells as well as epithelial cells lining the renal tubule, particularly the collecting ducts, consistent with high binding densities observed in the medulla by autoradiography. There was no evidence for a differential distribution in either ETA or ETB receptors visualized by the two techniques that might have indicated modified receptors or further subtypes in the human kidney.

Design and methods: Mononuclear cells were obtained from 10 patients with OA, 10 patients with RA and 10 patients with PA. Evaluation of kinetic parameters of PBR was performed using [H-3]PK 11195, a specific radioligand for this receptor, and compared with 10 healthy controls. Results: The results show a statistically significant decrease (37.5%, as an absolute percentage) in the maximal number of binding sites (B-max) of patients with OA, compared with healthy controls; however, the values of the dissociation constant (K-d) at equilibrium do not show any statistically significant variations. Conclusions: These data further confirm the presence of peripheral biochemical alterations in OA. As peripheral benzodiazepine receptors appear to be involved in the immune function, and in the protection of hematopoietic cells against oxygen radical damage, the observed decrease in B-max might be related to cellular protection.

Binding inhibition was examined for the G-protein coupled opioid, serotonin (5-HT), histamine, neurokinin and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) receptors, for the steroid estrogen-a receptor and for the ligand-gated ionchannel GABA(A) receptor. Hypericin showed the most potent binding inhibition of all tested constituents to human CRF1 receptor with an lC(50) value of 300 nM. Preliminary GTP gamma S-35 binding studies to CRF1 coupled G-protein indicated an antagonistic action for hypericin. The acylphloroglucinole hyperforin failed to inhibit I-125-astressin binding to hCRF(1) receptor up to 10 muM. Hyperforin inhibited binding to opioid and serotonin (5-HT) receptors at IC50 values between 0.4 and 3 muM while hypericin and pseudohypericin inhibited with weaker potency. The biflavonoid 13,118-biapigenin inhibited H-3-estradiol binding to the estrogen-a receptor with an IC50 value of 1 muM. The inhibition of H-3-muscimol binding to the GABA(A) receptor is likely to be exclusively due to GABA present in the extract. We therefore hypothesize that additive or synergistic actions of several ditsinct compounds may be responsible for the beneficial antidepressant effect of St. John's wort.

Method: Density of platelet serotonin transporters was determined by radioligand binding analysis. Genotyping was performed by PCR amplification of polymorphic regions followed by size determination of the obtained fragments. Results: The control subjects and the two groups of patients were similar with respect to the genotype and allele distribution belonging to the two polymorphisms in the serotonin transporter gene for. An interaction between status (control, unipolar- or bipolar patient) and VNTR genotype regarding the number of platelet serotonin transporters was observed; unipolar patients with the genotype 12/10 had more platelet serotonin transporters than bipolar patients and controls with this genotype. No association related to the polymorphism was found in the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene. Conclusion: An association was observed between the polymorphism in intron 2 of the serotonin transporter gene and the number of platelet serotonin transporters. Unipolar patients with a particular genotype had more platelet serotonin transporters than the corresponding controls and bipolar patients.

GHS receptor subtypes have also been identified in the heart; and a gastric-derived peptide, named ghrelin, has recently been proposed as a natural ligand. Our aim was to investigate the presence of GHS receptors in a wide range of human tissues, by radioreceptor assay with [I-125]Tyr-Ala-hexarelin. GHS receptors were detected mainly in the myocardium, but they were also present (in order of decreasing binding activity) in adrenal, gonads, arteries, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, pituitary, thyroid, adipose tissue, veins, uterus, skin, and lymphnode. In contrast, negligible binding was found in parathyroid, pancreas, placenta, mammary gland, prostate, salivary gland, stomach, colon, and spleen. Hexarelin, MK 0677, and human ghrelin completely displaced the radioligand from binding sites of endocrine tissues, but MK 0677 and ghrelin were less potent than hexarelin. In nonendocrine tissues, both MK 0677 and ghrelin were inactive in displacement of [I-125]Tyr-Ala-hexarelin, whereas hexarelin was as active as a displacing agent in endocrine tissues. This study provides the first detailed analysis of the tissue localization of GHS receptors and suggests that a still unknown receptor subtype, specific for peptidyl GHS, may exist in the heart and in other tissues.

Herein we describe the synthesis, the F-18-labelling as well as the biological evaluation of our latest PDE2A (radio-)ligand 9-(5-Butoxy-2-fluorophenyl)-2-(2-([F-18])fluoroethoxy)7-methylimidazo[5,1-c]pyrido[2,3-e][1,2,4]triazine (([F-18])TA5). It is the most potent PDE2A ligand out of our series of imidazopyridotriazine-based derivatives so far (IC50 hPDE2A = 3.0 nM; IC50 hPDE10A > 1000 nM). Radiolabelling was performed in a one-step procedure starting from the corresponding tosylate precursor. In vitro autoradiography on rat and pig brain slices displayed a homogenous and non-specific binding of the radioligand. Investigation of stability in vivo by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) and micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) analyses of plasma and brain samples obtained from mice revealed a high fraction of one main radiometabolite. Hence, we concluded that [F-18]TA5 is not appropriate for molecular imaging of PDE2A neither in vitro nor in vivo. Our ongoing work is focusing on further structurally modified compounds with enhanced metabolic stability.

In animal models, CRH has been shown to modulate dopamine release, and this interaction is believed to contribute to stress-induced relapse in neuropsychiatric disorders. Here we investigated whether CRH administration induces dopamine release in humans, using positron emission tomography (PET). Eight healthy volunteers (5 female, 22-48 years old) completed two PET scans with the dopamine D-2/3 receptor radioligand [C-11]-(+)-PHNO: once after saline injection, and once after injection of corticorelin (synthetic human CRH). We also assessed subjective reports and measured plasma levels of endocrine hormones (adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol). Relative to saline, corticorelin administration decreased binding of the D-2/3 PET probe [C-11]-(+)-PHNO, suggesting dopamine release. Endocrine stress markers were also elevated, in line with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, but we detected no changes in subjective ratings. Preliminary results from this proof-of-concept study suggests that CRH challenge in combination with [C-11]-(+)-PHNO PET may serve as an assay of dopamine release, presenting a potential platform for evaluating CRH/dopamine interactions in neuropsychiatric disorders and CRH antagonists as potential treatment avenues.

Radioligand binding assays showed that several 6-substituted benzimidazole derivatives displayed high affinities binding to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor at the same order of magnitude to telmisartan. The biological evaluation on spontaneously hypertensive rats showed that 2-[4-[2-n-propyl-4-methyl-6-(1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)benzimidazole-1-yl]methyll-1H-indol-1-yl]benzoic acid, 1c, could cause significant decrease on MBP in a dose dependent manner. Its maximal response lowered 53 mmHg of MBP at 5 mg/kg and 64 mmHg of MBP at 10 mg/kg after oral administration, and the significant antihypertensive effect lasted beyond 24 h, which was better than both losartan and telmisartan. A study designed to determine acute toxicity showed that 1c had low acute toxicity with no significant changes in the weight and no obvious untoward reactions. The encouraging results make 1c an effective and durable anti-hypertension drug candidate and deserve further investigation for therapeutic application. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

To gain information on the active conformation, we synthesized analogues of 1 with a cyclopentane-1,3-diyl linker. Affinities and functional activities were determined at 'recombinant hH(X)R (x: 1-4) subtypes on Sf9 cell membranes (radioligand binding, [S-35]GTP gamma S, or GTPase assays) and in part in luciferase assays on human or mouse H4R (HEK-293 cells). The most potent H4R agonists among 14 racemates were separated by chiral HPLC, yielding eight enantiomerically pure compounds. Configurations were assigned based on X-ray structures of intermediates and a stereocontrolled synthetic pathway. (+)-2-Cyano-1-{[trans-(1S,3S)-3-(1H-imidazol-4-yl) cyclop entyl]methy11-3-[2-(phenylsulfanyl) ethyl] guanidine ((1S,3S)-UR-RG98, 39a) was the most potent H4R agonist in this series (EC50 11 nM; H4R vs H3R, >100-fold selectivity; H1R, H2R, negligible activities), whereas the optical antipode proved to be an H4R antagonist ([S-35]GTP gamma S assay).

We found that in the presence of the studied peptides the amount of the specifically bound ligand, [H-3] GABA, varied. Preliminary intranasal administration of Selank also induced changes in the number of specific binding sites of [H-3] GABA but did not affect the affinity of the receptors. More complex and delayed effects were caused by the preliminary intranasal administration of Arg-Pro-Gly-Pro (RPGP). The data that were obtained in the research also indicate the impact of the peptides on cellular regulatory mechanisms that are not associated with the ligand-receptor interaction of studied peptides in the places of their action. Thus, the biological effects of Selank were apparently due to a combination of the direct modulating action of the peptide on the target receptor and the initiation of the biochemical cellular mechanisms that determine the molecular basis of the physiological effect of the peptide.

The isoxazoline target in house fly (Musca domestica) brain has subnanomolar affinity for [H-3]fluralaner and a unique pattern of sensitivity to isoxazolines and avermectin B-1a (AVE) but not to fipronil and alpha-endosulfan. Inhibitor specificity profiles for 15 isoxazolines examined with Musca GABA-R and [H-3]fluralaner, [H-3]-4'-ethynyl-4-n-propylbicycloorthobenzoate ([H-3]EBOB), and [H-3]AVE binding follow the same structure-activity trends although without high correlation. The 3 most potent of the 15 isoxazolines tested in Musca [H-3]fluralaner, [H-3]EBOB, and [H-3]AVE binding assays and in honeybee (Apis mellifera) brain [H-3]fluralaner assays are, generally those most toxic to Musca and four agricultural pests. Fluralaner does not inhibit [H-3]EBOB binding to the human GABA-R recombinant beta(3) homopentamer, which is highly sensitive to all of the commercial GABAergic insecticides. The unique isoxazoline binding site may resurrect the GABA-R as a major insecticide target.

We recently reported that this protein is neurolysin and now report upon the specificity of this binding site for various neuropeptides. Competition binding assays in rat brain and testis used I-125-Sar(1), Ile(8) angiotensin II (Ang II) as the radioligand in the presence of saturating concentrations of AT(1) and AT(2) receptor antagonists and 100 mu M parachloromercuribenzoate. Primary screening of 36 peptides and other compounds at 10 mu M concentration revealed seven peptides that inhibited specific binding > 50 %: ghrelin, Tyr(1) S36057 (a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor ligand), orphanin FQ and its congeners (Tyr(1) and Tyr(14)), Dynorphin A (1-8), and Ang (1-9). The selective neurolysin inhibitor Proline-Isoleucine dipeptide was inactive at 1 mM. These results suggest that the ability of PCMB to unmask high affinity binding of Ang II to neurolysin is a pharmacological effect and that neurolysin may significantly affect the activity of the renin-angiotensin system.

We explored BRS-3 expression in skeletal muscle from normal, obese or type-2 diabetic (T2D) patients, and the effect of [D-Phe(6), beta-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]bombesin(6-14) - BRS-3-agonist-peptide (BRS-3-AP) - on glucose-related effects, before or after BRS-3 gene silencing. In muscle tissue and primary cultured myocytes from altered metabolic states, BRS-3 gene/protein expressions were down-regulated. In normal, obese and T2D cells: A) BRS-3-AP as insulin enhanced BRS-3 and GLUT-4 mRNA/protein levels; improving glucotransporter translocation to plasma membrane, and B) BRS-3-AP caused a concentration-related-stimulation of glucose transport, being obese and T2D myocytes more sensitive to the ligand than normal. Wortmannin and PD98059, but not rapamycin, abolished the stimulatory action of BRS-3-AP on glucose transport. BRS-3 plays an important role in glucose metabolism, and could be use as a molecular target, and/or its ligand, as a therapeutic agent for obesity and diabetes treatments.

The aim of this study was to assess the influence of systemic morphine on cerebral serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) binding in dogs using SPECT with the 5-HT2A radioligand I-123-5I-R91150. Methods: 5-HT2A binding was estimated with and without morphine pretreatment in 8 dogs. The 5-HT2A binding indices in the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital cortex and in the subcortical region were obtained by semiquantification. Results: A significantly decreased 5-HT2A binding index was found in the morphine group for the right (morphine, 1.41 +/- 0.06; control, 1.52 +/- 0.10) and left (morphine, 1.44 +/- 0.08; control, 1.55 +/- 0.11) frontal cortices, with P = 0.012 and P = 0.040, respectively. No significant differences were noted for the other regions. Conclusion: Morphine decreased the frontocortical 5-HT2A availability, confirming an interaction between the 5-HTergic and the opioid systems. Whether this interaction is caused by decreased receptor density due to direct internalization or is the result of indirect actions, such as increased endogenous serotonin release, remains to be elucidated.

It is apparent that H-3 receptor antagonists produce in vivo effects in preclinical animal models of central diseases across a wide dose range. In order to characterize the relationship between efficacy in the preclinical models and H-3 receptor occupancy, a brain slice receptor autoradiography method was used. Brain slice receptor autoradiography requires less in vitro tissue processing, preserves brain structure, and provides anatomical localization of compound in the brain. Consistent with H-3 receptor distribution, in vitro autoradiography experiments demonstrated specific binding of [H-3]NAMH (N-alpha-methylhistamine) in rat cortex, and other brain regions, but not in cerebellum. Ex vivo H3R brain slice autoradiography was able to detect H-3 receptor occupancy by reference antagonists at doses lower than previously found using a homogenate assay format. The method is relatively quick with image acquisition on a beta-imager (TM) and is capable of detecting receptor occupancy in different brain regions simultaneously. Furthermore, the increased sensitivity should be useful in providing dosing guidelines for H-3 antagonists in both preclinical and clinical settings. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, these two series were modified in parallel at the adenine C2 position. N-6-3-Chlorobenzyl-5'-N-methyluronamides derivatives with functionalized 2-alkynyl chains of varying length terminating in a reactive carboxylate, ester, or amine group were full, potent human A(3)AR agonists. Flexibility of chain substitution allowed the conjugation with a fluorescent cyanine dye (Cy5) and biotin, resulting in binding K-i values of 17 and 36 nM, respectively. The distal end of the chain was predicted by homology modeling to bind at the A(3)AR extracellular regions. Corresponding L-nucleosides were nearly inactive in AR binding. In the 5'-truncated nucleoside series, 2-Cl analogues were more potent at A(3)AR than 2-H and 2-F, functional efficacy in adenylate cyclase inhibition varied, and introduction of a 2-alkynyl chain greatly reduced affinity. SAR parallels between the two series lost stringency at distal positions. The most potent and selective novel compounds were amine congener 15 (K-i = 2.1 nM) and truncated Partial agonist 22 (K-i = 4.9 nM).

A remarkable improvement in potency, and most noticeable, in selectivity has been achieved, as exemplified by the 3-cyclopropylmethyl-8-methoxy-1-(4-methylbenzyl)-1H,3H-pyrido[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione (10) that combines a very high affinity at hA(3) (K-i = 2.24 nM), with lack of affinity for the A(1), A(2), and A(2B) receptors. On the basis of the published hA(3) receptor model (PDB 1OEA), molecular modeling studies, including molecular dynamics (MID) simulations, have been performed to depict the binding mode of the 1H,3H-pyrido[2,1-f]purine-2,4-diones and to justify the selectivity against the other adenosine receptors. These studies have led to novel features of the cavity where our antagonists are bound so that the cavity is lined by the hydrogen-bonded Gln 167-Asn 250 pair and by the highly conserved Phe 168.

Saturation radioligand binding of the NMDA receptor agonists [H-3]- glycine and [H-3]-glutamate showed that only glycine binds to human NR3A (hNR3A) with high affinity (K-d = 535 nM (277-793 nM)). Eight amino acids, which correspond to amino acids that are critical for ligand binding to other NMDA receptor subunits. situated within the S1S2 predicted ligand binding domain of hNR3A were mutated, which resulted in complete or near complete loss of [H-3]-glycine binding to hNR3A. The NMDA NR1 glycine site agonist D-serine and partial agonist HA-966 (3-amino-1-hydroxypyrrolid-2-one), similarly to glycine displaced [H-3]-glycine monophasically, suggesting a single common binding site. However, neither the partial agonist D-cycloserine nor the antagonist 7-chlorokynurenic acid displaced [H-3]-glycine. Using homology modelling, a model of the NR3A binding pocket was generated which we suggest can be used to identify candidate agonists and antagonists. Our data show that glycine is a ligand, and most probably the endogenous ligand, for native NR3A at a binding site with unique pharmacological characteristics. (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Insulin is an important nutritional signal from the periphery that may regulate the reproductive axis. To determine whether insulin acts directly on the GnRH neuron, we performed studies in mouse-derived GnRH-expressing cell lines. Both insulin receptor protein and mRNA were detected in these cells. A saturation radioligand binding assay revealed high affinity, low capacity binding sites for insulin in GnRH neurons. Insulin also stimulated GnRH promoter activity in GnRH neurons. This effect was blocked by pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059, indicating a role for MAP kinase signaling. In transient transfection studies, insulin treatment stimulated expression of a 1250 bp mouse GnRH gene promoter fragment four-fold when compared to promoter activity in untreated cells. In contrast, insulin did not stimulate activity of a 587 bp fragment of the mGnRH gene promoter, indicating that the promoter elements mediating insulin stimulation of the GnRH promoter are located between -1250 and -587 bp. Our studies suggest that insulin may regulate reproductive function by direct effects on the GnRH neurons and specifically by stimulating GnRH gene expression. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Therefore, in the present report, receptor binding and pharmacological studies were performed to characterize the interaction between methamphetamine and sigma receptors. Of the two major sigma receptor subtypes, sigma(1) and sigma(2), competition binding studies showed that methamphetamine has a 22-fold preferential affinity for the sigma(1) subtype. Saturation binding studies using the sigma(1) selective radioligand [H-3](+)-pentazocine showed that in the presence of methamphetamine, there was a significant change in K-d, but not B-max, suggesting competitive interactions. In behavioral studies, pretreatment of Swiss Webster mice with the sigma(1) receptor antagonists, BD1063 or BD1047, significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of methamphetamine. Mice that were administered an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide to down-regulate brain sigma(1) receptors also exhibited a reduced locomotor stimulatory response to methamphetamine, as compared to control mice receiving mismatch oligonucleotides. Together, the data suggest that sigma(1) receptors are involved in the acute actions of methamphetamine and that antagonism of this subtype is sufficient to prevent the locomotor stimulatory effects. of methamphetamine.

In this study, we synthesised 11 new linear MSH analogues and tested their binding to the human MC receptors (MC1, MC3, MC4 and MC5) expressed in COS cells. Our results show that introduction of Asp in position 4 similarly affects the binding to the MC1, MC4 and MC5 receptors, but drastically lowers the binding to the MC3 receptor. Arg(5) substitution shows relatively high affinity for the MC4 receptor, while the results also give further support for specific importance of His(6) for the MC1 receptor. Introduction of Asp in position 10, mimicking gamma-MSH, decreased the affinity for the MC3 receptor in similar manner as for the MC4 receptor, suggesting that there are important differences in the binding conformation of gamma-MSH and NPD-MSH. Our results provide further information about the ligand binding requirements for each of the MC receptor subtypes, and highlights differential influence of the core residues in the MSH peptides. The data set also provides useful information for further calculations and modeling of MC receptor binders. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Therefore, we examined the effect of treatment of, and withdrawal from, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine or clozapine on the binding of [H-3]N-[1-(2-thienyl)cyclohexyl]piperidine ([H-3]TCP) to the open ion channel of the NMDA receptor in rat caudate-putamen, hippocampus and frontal cortex. [H-3]TCP binding was not significantly different in the caudate-putamen, hippocampus and cortex after three months of treatment with any antipsychotic drug. There were significant decreases in [H-3]TCP binding in rat caudate-putamen and cortex, but not hippocampus, one month after ceasing treatment. Decreases in the caudate-putamen were detected in rats previously treated with chlorpromazine (0.1 mg/kg/day) and clozapine (0.1 and 1.0 nig/kg/day). In the cortex, decreases in [H-3]TCP binding were also detected in rats previously treated with olanzapine (0.1 mg/kg/day) for three months. These data suggest that changes in the NMDA receptor associated ion channels occur following antipsychotic drug withdrawal. (0 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we examined in particular the pharmacological property of a fraction isolated from a methanolic extract of M. chamomilla, which was identified by HPLC-MS-MS analysis as apigenin. By radioreceptor binding assays, we demonstrated the ability of the flavone to displace a specific radioligand, [H-3]Ro 15-1788, from the central benzodiazepine binding site. Electrophysiological studies performed on cultured cerebellar granule cells showed that apigenin reduced GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-activated Cl(-)currents in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect was blocked by co-application of Ro 15-1788, a specific benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Accordingly, apigenin reduced the latency in the onset of picrotoxin-induced convulsions. Moreover, apigenin injected i.p. in rats reduced locomotor activity, but did not demonstrate anxiolytic, myorelaxant, or anticonvulsant activities. The present results seem to suggest that the inhibitory activity of apigenin on locomotor behaviour in rats cannot be ascribed to an interaction with GABA(A)- benzodiazepine receptor but to other neurotransmission systems, since it is not blocked by Ro 15-1788.

Methods: We investigated 6 neurologically healthy subjects and 5 PD patients: 2 with mild unilateral disease, 1 with mild-to-moderate bilateral disease, and 2 with moderately severe bilateral disease. The healthy subjects underwent a 3-h PET scan (26 frames) and the PD subjects underwent a 2-h PET scan (23 frames) while F-18-FECNT was being injected over the first 5 min of the scan. Arterial blood samples were taken throughout scanning for well-counter and metabolite analysis to determine the presence of possible active metabolites. The scans were reconstructed; then we placed spheric regions of interest in the caudate nuclei, putamena, thalami, brain stem, cerebellum, and occipital cortex of each subject. The radioactivity level in each region was calculated for each frame of a subject's PET scan. Then we calculated target tissue-to-cerebellum ratios for each time frame. Results: The analysis of arterial blood samples revealed that metabolism of the tracer was rapid. The ether-extractable component of the arterial input was >98% pure F-18-FECNT. The caudate nucleus and putamen exhibited the highest uptake and prolonged retention of the radioligand. They both attained maximum uptake at similar to90 min, with the healthy subjects' average caudate- and putamen-to-cerebellum ratios (+/-SD) at that time being 9.0 +/- 1.2 and 7.8 +/- 0.7, respectively. The maximal caudate-to-cerebellum ratios for the healthy subjects ranged from 7.6 to 10.5 and their maximal putamen-to-cerebellum ratios ranged from 7.1 to 9.3. The 2 early-stage, unilateral PD patients had, at 90 min, an average right caudate-to-cerebellum ratio of 5.3 +/- 1.1 and a left ratio of 5.9 +/- 0.7 and an average right putamen-to cerebellum ratio of 2.8 +/- 0.1 and a left ratio of 3.0 +/- 0.6. The late-stage PD patients had, at 90 min, an average right caudate-to-cerebellum ratio of 3.7 +/- 0.4 and a left ratio of 3.9 +/- 0 and an average right putamen-to cerebellum ratio of 1.8 +/- 0.1 and a left ratio of 1.8 +/- 0. Conclusion: These results indicate that F-18-FECNT is an excellent candidate radioligand for in vivo imaging of the DAT system in humans. It has a much higher affinity for DAT than for the serotonin transporter and yields the highest peak striatum-to-cerebellum ratios and has among the most favorable kinetics of F-18-radiolabeled DAT ligands. Having picked up presymptomatic changes in the hemisphere opposite the unaffected side of the body in our earlystage (unilateral) PD patients, it appears that, like other DAT radioligands, it may be able to identify presymptomatic PD.

The placenta is a site of production of hypophysiotropic factors that participate in the control of local hormone production, as well as the respective hypothalamic-pituitary neurohormones. In the present study, we show the expression of PACAP gene and irPACAP distribution within rat and human placental tissues, by means of RT-PCR and immunohystochemical experiments. Tn both rat and human placenta, we evaluated the expression of PAC(1) gene by Northern hybridization analysis performed with a P-32-labeled 706 nt complementary DNA probe, derived from the full-length coding region of the rPAC(1) complementary DNA. The results of these experiments demonstrate the presence, in both human and rat placenta, of a 7.5-kb transcript similar in size to those detected in the ovary, brain, and hypothalamus. Alternative splicing of two exons occurs in human and rat PAC(1) gene generating splice variants with variable tissue-specific expression. To ascertain which of the splice variants were expressed in placental tissue we performed PT-nested PCR using primers flanking the insertion sequence termed hip/hop cassette in rat or SV1/SV2 box in human gene. Electrophoretic analysis of the PCR products showed a different pattern of expression of messenger RNA splicing variants in human and rat placenta. In particular, the rat placenta expresses the short PAC(1) receptor (PAC(1short)), the rPAC(1)-hip or hop (which are indistinguishable with the primers used), and the rPAC(1)-hip-hop, whereas the human placenta expresses only the PAC(1)SV(1) (or SV2) variant, structurally homologous to the rat PAC(1) hip (or hop). Sequence analysis of the human PCR-amplified PAC(1) variant was therefore carried out and revealed that human placenta only expresses the PAC(1)SV(2) isoform. The presence and characterization of PACAP binding sites was then investigated in human placenta by radioligand binding studies performed on crude membrane preparation using [I-126]PACAP27 as tracer. Scatchard analysis of the binding results revealed the presence of two binding sites, one with high affinity and low capacity (K-d 0.33 +/- 0.04 nM; B-max 36.9 +/- 12.1 fmol/mg protein) and one with low affinity and high capacity (K-d 24 +/- 6.9 nM, B-max 9.3 +/- 0.19 pmol/mg protein). The relative potencies of PACAP-related peptides for inhibition of radioligand binding were: PACAP27 greater than or equal to PACAP38 > VIP, whereas GHRH and other unrelated peptides, such as CRH and beta-endorphin, did not inhibit [I-125]PACAP27 binding. In conclusion, in this study, we provide evidence for the expression of PACAP within rat and human placenta. We also demonstrate that both human and rat placenta express the PAC, gene and that the human tissue has binding sites for PACAP. These findings may suggest a role for PACAP in the regulation of placental physiology through autocrine and/or paracrine mechanisms.

This study estimated lesional uptake, normal physiologic concentrations, and temporal variation on delayed PET/CT of Ga-68-PSMA-11 across different molecular imaging PSMA (miPSMA) expression scores in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostatic carcinoma. Methods: We retrospectively studied 50 patients who were evaluated for Lu-177-PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy and underwent Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT to determine disease status. Their mean age was 67.5 +/- 8 y (52-84 y), and their average serum prostate-specific antigen level was 401 +/- 1,353 ng/mL (0.098-9,235.13 ng/mL) at the time of scanning. They underwent standard Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT an average of 65 min after injection (60-90 min). Tumors (n = 50) were correlated with miPSMA expression score and uptake. Physiologic tracer distribution was estimated by placing a volume of interest 1 cm in diameter for smaller organs (submandibular, parotid, lacrimal, and tubarial glands; renal cortices; blood pool; and bowel) and 3 cm for larger organs (liver and spleen). SUVmax and SUVmean were estimated for each region. Tumor-to-spleen (T/S), tumor-to-liver (T/L), and tumor-to-parotid (T/P) ratios were calculated for each lesion. For 16 patients who underwent a delayed scan an average of 135 min after injection (120-150 min), additional analysis evaluated the effect of the delay. Results: Uptake was maximal in renal cortices, followed by salivary glands, bowel, spleen, liver, lacrimal glands, and blood pool. SUVmax averaged 37.7 +/- 22.1 for renal cortices, 15.4 +/- 7.3 for submandibular glands, 14.4 +/- 7.1 for parotid glands, 9.4 +/- 4.9 for spleen, 6.2 +/- 3.7 for lacrimal glands, 5.9 +/- 2.3 for liver, 5.3 +/- 1.41 for tubarial glands, 13.8 +/- 7.6 for bowel, and 2.4 +/- 1.9 for blood pool. SUVmax averaged 10.33 +/- 3.27 (6.46-17) for miPSMA expression score 2 and 38.21 +/- 25.9 (7.68-119.08) for score 3. T/S and T/P ratios averaged 1.21 +/- 0.44 (0.48-2.04) and 0.6 +/- 0.18 (0.39-0.87), respectively, for score 2 and 5.05 +/- 4.46 (1.25-20.89) and 3.15 +/- 2.09 (1.06-9.45), respectively, for score 3. SUVmax for score 3 lesions averaged 18.85, which increased significantly to 26.24 on delayed imaging (P = 0.0001). However, T/L, T/S, and T/P ratios did not significantly change. Temporal variation in normal organs showed SUVmax to increase significantly on delayed scans for salivary (submandibular and parotid) and lacrimal glands and renal cortices, whereas SUVmean increased significantly for spleen; liver; and parotid, tubarial, and lacrimal glands and insignificantly for other organs. Conclusion: These data form a basis for a proposed consensus on standard reference ranges for quantitative Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT. The temporal variations should be kept in mind for delayed acquisitions; T/S, T/L, and T/P ratios might serve as better markers for such scenarios.

The resulting loss of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) leads to excessive glutamate signaling via metabotropic glutamate subtype 5 receptors (mGluR5) which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In the present study we used the radioligand 3-[18F]fluoro-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)benzonitrile ([F-18]FPEB) in simultaneous PET-MR imaging of males with FXS and age- and gender-matched controls to assess the availability of mGlu5 receptors in relevant brain areas. Patients with FXS showed lower [F-18]FPEB binding potential (p< 0.01), reflecting reduced mGluR5 availability, than the healthy controls throughout the brain, with significant group differences in insula, anterior cingulate, parahippocampal, inferior temporal and olfactory cortices, regions associated with deficits in inhibition, memory, and visuospatial processes characteristic of the disorder. The results are among the first to provide in vivo evidence of decreased availability of mGluR5 in the brain in individuals with FXS than in healthy controls. The consistent results across the subjects, despite the tremendous challenges with neuroimaging this population, highlight the robustness of the protocol and support for its use in drug occupancy studies; extending our radiotracer development and application efforts from mice to humans.

Recent high-resolution structures of homomeric glycine receptors have confirmed the presence of five orthosteric binding sites located in the extracellular subunit interfaces of the receptor complex that are targeted by strychnine. Here, we report the synthesis and extensive pharmacological evaluation of bivalent ligands composed of two strychnine pharmacophores connected by appropriate spacers optimized toward simultaneous binding to two adjacent orthosteric sites of homomeric a 1 glycine receptors. In all bivalent ligands, the two strychnine units were linked through C-2 by amide spacers of various lengths ranging from 6 to 69 atoms. Characterization of the compounds in two functional assays and in a radioligand binding assay indicated that compound 11a, with a spacer consisting of 57 atoms, may be capable of bridging the homomeric alpha 1 GlyRs by simultaneous occupation of two adjacent strychnine-binding sites. The findings are supported by docking experiments to the crystal structure of the homomeric glycine receptor. Based on its unique binding mode, its relatively high binding affinity and antagonist potency, and its slow binding kinetics, the bivalent strychnine analogue 11 a could be a valuable tool to study the functional properties of glycine receptors.

The antioxidant resveratrol acts as a non-selective adenosine receptor agonist	FREE RADICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE			English	Article						Resveratrol; Adenosine receptors; GPCR modulation; C6 glioma cells	A(2A) RECEPTORS; FORCE-FIELD; INFLAMMATION; MODULATION; COMPLEX; A(1); HETEROTETRAMER; METADYNAMICS; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION	Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenolic antioxidant with a proven protective role in several human diseases involving oxidative stress, although the molecular mechanism underlying this effect remains unclear. The present work tried to elucidate the molecular mechanism of RSV's role on signal transduction modulation. Our biochemical analysis, including radioligand binding, real time PCR, western blotting and adenylyl cyclase activity, and computational studies provide insights into the RSV binding pathway, kinetics and the most favored binding pose involving adenosine receptors, mainly A(2A) subtype. In this study, we show that RSV target adenosine receptors (AdoRs), affecting gene expression, receptor levels, and the downstream adenylyl cyclase (AC)/PKA pathway. Our data demonstrate that RSV activates AdoRs. Moreover, RSV activate A(2A) receptors by directly binding to the classical orthosteric binding site. Intriguingly, RSV-induced receptor activation can stimulate or inhibit AC activity depending on concentration and exposure time. Such subtle and multifaceted regulation of the AdoRs/AC/PKA pathway might contribute to the protective role of RSV. Our findings suggest that RSV molecular action is mediated, at least in part, by activation of adenosine receptors and create the opportunity to interrogate the therapeutic use of RSV in pathological conditions involving AdoRs, such as Alzheimer.

However, due to their high affinity and specificity, mAbs may be an attractive option for brain PET if their brain distribution can be facilitated. In the present study, a F(ab')(2) fragment of the amyloidbeta (A beta) protofibril selective mAb158 was chemically conjugated to the transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody 8D3 to enable TfR mediated transcytosis across the BBB. The generated bispecific protein, 8D3-F(ab')(2)-h158, was subsequently radiolabeled and used for microPET imaging of A beta pathology in two mouse models of AD. [124I]8D3-F(ab')(2)-h158 was distributed across the BBB several fold more than unmodified mAbs in general and its accumulation in the brain reflected disease progression, while its concentration in blood and other organs remained stable across all age groups studied. Cerebellum was largely devoid of 8D3-F(ab')(2)-h158 in young and middle aged mice, while mice older than 18 months also showed some accumulation in cerebellum. In a longer perspective, the use of bispecific antibodies as PET ligands may enable in vivo 'immunohistochemistry' also of other proteins in the brain for which PET radioligands are lacking.

LEAVES; ANGIOTENSIN-II; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; BETA-ADRENOCEPTORS; RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; CONVERTING-ENZYME	Vasodilatory effects of mulberry leaf extract (MLE) and its possible underlying mechanisms on porcine basilar artery (PBA) were investigated by measuring changes in isometric tension in vitro. MLE slightly relaxed 60 mM KCI pre-contracted PBA rings (9.4% at 540 mu g/mL). A treatment with MLE induced extensive relaxation under pre-contraction with 0.1 mu M U-46619 (EC50 = 49.4 mu g/mL). Neither endothelial denudation nor treatment with atenolol (10 mu M) affected MLE-induced relaxation. Relaxation induced by MLE (540 mu g/mL) was significantly attenuated by cimetidine (10 mu M). MLE inhibited angiotensin I-induced contraction in endothelium-intact PBA rings (EC50 = 25 mu g/mL), similar to captopril. Therefore, the possible mechanisms underlying MLE-induced relaxation in PBA might be mediated through: (1) functional antagonism of thromboxane A(2) receptors; (2) suppression of angiotensin I-induced contraction; (3) Ca2+ influx inhibition; (4) stimulation of H-2-receptors. Moreover, MLE contained significant amounts of nitrite, nitrate and several phenolic compounds, possibly associated with MLE-induced relaxation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, we detected moderate uptake of [F-18]1 in baboon thalamus, a brain region lacking 5-HT1AR We sought to investigate the relative binding of [F-18]1 to 5-HT1AR, alpha R-1, and 5-HT7R in vitro. Using autoradiography in human brain sections, specific binding of [F-18)1 to 5-HT1AR was confirmed. However, [F-18]1 also showed 26% binding to alpha R-1 in PFC. The hippocampal formation exhibited 51% and 92% binding of [F-18]1 to alpha R-1 and 5-HT1AR, respectively. Thalamus and cerebellum showed very little binding. There is no measurable specific binding of [F-18]1 to 5-HT7R and no effect of temperature on [F-18]1 specific binding to 5-HT1AR or alpha R-1 These results indicate that, while [F-18]FECUMI-101 is not a completely selective 5-HT1AR ligand for receptor quantification, it may be useful for occupancy measurements of drugs acting at 5-HT1AR in vivo.

We found that NaV1.3 from rat was the most stable after detergent solubilisation. The order of stability was rNaV1.3 > hNaV1.2 > hNaV1.1 > hNaV1.6> hNaV1.3 > hNaV1.4. However, a comparison with the VGSC from Electrophorus electricus, which is most similar to NaV1.4, shows that the eel VGSC is considerably more stable in detergent than the human VGSCs examined. We conclude that current methods of structural analysis, such as single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM), may be most usefully targeted to eel VGSC or rNaV13, but that structural analysis on the full spectrum of VGSCs, by methods that require greater stability such as crystallisation and X-ray crystallography, will require further stabilisation of the channel.

Demomedin C resulted by coupling a Boc-protected N-4-chelator to neuromedin C (human GRP(18-27)), which, after Tc-99m-labeling, afforded [Tc-99m]Demomedin C. Demomedin C showed high affinity and selectivity for the GRPR during receptor autoradiography on human cancer samples (IC50 in nM: GRPR, 1.4 +/- 0.2; NMBR, 106 +/- 18; and BB3R, >1000). It triggered GRPR internalization in HEK-GRPR cells and Ca2+ release in PC-3 cells (EC50 = 1.3 nM). [Tc-99m]Demomedin C rapidly and specifically internalized at 37 degrees C in PC-3 cells and was stable in mouse plasma. [Tc-99m]Demomedin C efficiently and specifically localized in human PC-3 implants in mice (9.84 +/- 0.81%ID/g at 1 h pi; 6.36 +/- 0.8596ID/g at 4 h pi, and 0.41 +/- 0.07%ID/g at 4 h pi block). Thus, human GRP-based radioligands, such as [Tc-99m]Demomedin C, can successfully target GRPR-expressing human tumors in vivo while displaying attractive biological features-e.g. higher GRPR-selectivity-vs their frog-homologues.

CCK1 receptors are coupled to G alpha(q/11)-proteins, localized mainly in the gastrointestinal tract, and implicated in the regulation of various digestive functions. A primary screen was performed using a cell-based assay that used the beta-lactamase gene reporter controlled by the transcriptional activator NFAT. The assay was validated with the CCK1 receptor antagonist, lorglumide, and automated by the use of a liquid-handling robot MultiProbe II. Off-target hits were triaged by counterscreening against gene reporter cells activated by a combination of thapsigargin and phorbol ester. Purification of active compounds was guided by the beta-lactamase gene reporter and Ca2+ mobilization assays. Pure compounds were characterized by Ca2+ mobilization, radioligand binding, inositol-1 phosphate formation, and Eu-GTP binding assays. The selectivity of inhibition was tested against a panel of G alpha(q/11), G alpha(s), and G alpha(i/0)-coupled receptors. These studies led to the identification of a novel G alpha(q/11)-selective inhibitor.

In receptor binding studies, the N-benzyl derivative 7a (WMS-1813) revealed extraordinarily high sigma(1) receptor affinity (K-i = 1.4 nM) and excellent sigma(1)/sigma(2) Selectivity (>600fold). In vitro biotransformation of 7a with rat liver microsomes led to three main metabolites. N-Debenzylation was inhibited by introduction of an N-phenylethyl residue (7g). The PET tracer [F-18]7a was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 13 with K[F-18]F-K222-carbonate complex. The decay corrected radiochemical yield of [F-18]7a was 35-48% with a radiochemical purity of >99.5% and a specific activity of 150-238 GBq/mu mol. The radiotracer properties were evaluated in female CD-1 mice by organ distribution and ex vivo brain autoradiography. The radiotracer uptake in the brain was fast and sufficient, with values of similar to 4% injected dose per gram. Target specificity of [F-18]7a was validated in blocking studies by preapplication of haloperidol, and significant reduction in the uptake of radioactivity was observed in the brain and peripheral organs expressing sigma(1) receptors.

In this study receptor binding autoradiography of [3 H]MPEP, a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) selective radioligand, was used to investigate possible changes in mGluR5 in the basal ganglia Of L-Dopa-treated 1-methyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkeys having developed LIDs compared to animals in which LIDs was prevented by adjunct treatments. LIDs were associated with an increase of mGluR5 specific binding in the posterior putamen and pallidum (+41 % and +56%) compared to controls. By contrast, prevention of dyskinesias was associated with an important decrease of mGluR5 specific binding in these areas (-37% and -48%) compared with dyskinetic animals. Moreover, an upregulation (+34%) of mGluR5 receptor binding was seen in the anterior caudate nucleus of saline treated MPTP monkeys. This study is the first to provide evidence that enhanced mGluR5 specific binding in the posterior putamen and pallidum may contribute to the pathogenesis of LIDs in PD. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we investigated this hypothesis further and have elucidated some underlying mechanisms. We performed DNA microarray analyses of DPCs and found that adenosine stimulation increases fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF-7) gene expression levels by greater than 2-fold. Elevations of the extracellular FGF-7 protein levels were also observed. These upregulations of FGF-7 both at mRNA and protein levels were inhibited by A2b adenosine receptor-specific antagonist, alloxazine, but not by antagonists for other subtypes. In addition, the intracellular cAMP levels were raised by adenosine in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, an increase of intracellular cAMP augmented the FGF-7 upregulation. Taken together, these results show that adenosine treatment of DPCs upregulates FGF-7 expression via the A2b adenosine receptor and that cAMP acts as one of the second messengers in this pathway. Furthermore, treatment with FGF-7 at concentrations of 10ng/ml or greater significantly stimulated hair fiber elongation in human scalp hair follicle organ cultures. These data imply that adenosine might stimulate hair growth through FGF-7 upregulation in DPCs.

Slower GnRH pulses favor release (and higher circulating levels) of pituitary FSH, while faster pulses favor LH release. We used radioligand binding and inositol phosphate production (a measure of G-protein coupling) in association with mutational analysis to identify the impact of evolved sequence specializations that regulate receptor concentration at the plasma membrane and K-d in primate GnRHRs. Our results show that mutations appear to provide a mechanism that allows independent adjustment of response sensitivity and squelching (suppression) of low-level signals (noise), both desirable features for recognition of frequency-modulated signals. We identify specific amino acid residues that appear to be involved in these processes. This investigation occurred in light of recent observations that restriction of GnRHR plasma membrane expression developed under strong convergent pressure and concurrently with the complex pattern of cyclicity associated with primate reproduction. The findings present an evolved means for increased effectiveness of detection of a frequency-m modulated signal and provide a strategy to identify similar mechanisms in other receptors.

Here, we describe the synthesis and characterization of fluorescent analogs of LTB4 that are easy to produce, inexpensive, and without the disadvantages of a radioligand. Fluorescent LTB4 is useful for labeling LTB4 receptors for which no antibodies are available and for performing one-step fluorescence polarization assays conducive to high-throughput screening. We found that orange and green fluorescent LTB4 were full agonists that activated the LTB4 receptor BLT1 with EC50 values of 68 and 40 nM, respectively (4.5 nM for unmodified LTB4). Flow cytometric measurements and confocal imaging showed that fluorescent LTB4 colocalized with BLT1. Fluorescence polarization measurements showed that orange fluorescent LTB4 bound to BLT1 with a K-d of 66 nM and that this binding could be displaced by unlabeled LTB4 and other BLT1-specific ligands. Fluorescent LTB4 analogs were also able to displace tritiated LTB4. Orange fluorescent LTB4 binding to enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged BLT1 could be observed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. In addition to being a useful alternative to radiolabeled LTB4, the unique properties of fluorescently labeled LTB4 allow a variety of detection technologies to be used.

We investigated the effect of 1-BnTIQ-, TIQ- or 2-methyl-TIQ-treatment on the binding of 2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)-[N-methyl-C-11]tropane to striatal dopamine transporters (DATs) in mice. Neither 1-BnTlQ (80 mg/kg, i.p,, twice per day for 10 days) nor 2-methyl-TIQ (40 mg/kg, i.p., twice per day for 10 days) affected the radioligand-DAT binding. while TIQ (80 mg/kg, i.p., twice per day for 10 days) induced a 14% decrease.

This increase was first reported to be a receptor recruitment due to the fact that the increase induced by subsolubilizing concentrations of Triton X-100 was not additive to the receptor increase induced by acute stress [J Neural Transm 87 (1992) 97]. In synaptosomal membranes from stressed chicks, the incorporation of alkaline phosphatase or ATP into the lumen abolished or increased, respectively, the receptor unmasking after incubation at 4 and 37 degreesC, suggesting that phosphorylation plays a role in the recruitment mechanism. Moreover, both colchicine and vinblastine, but not taxol, abolished the recruitment induced by stress at 37 degreesC only in synaptosomes, suggesting that micrutubule depolymerization plays a role in the masking of receptors. Furthermore, both cytochalasins C and D induced an increase of the receptor density, abolished by N-ethylmaleimide, in both the stressed and nonstressed conditions, suggesting that microfilament depolyinerization induced the exposure to the radioligand of a cytosolic vesicular receptor pool, which had not fused yet with the postsynaptic membrane.

The common a subunit forms non-covalent heterodimers with different subunits. Two novel human glycoprotein hormonelike genes, alpha2 (A2) and beta5 (B5), recently have been identified. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, the two subunits were found as potential heterodimerization partners. Immunological analyses confirmed the heterodimerization of A2 and B5 in transfected cells and their colocalization in the anterior pituitary. Recombinant A2/B5 heterodimeric glycoproteins, purified using cation exchange and size fractionation chromatography, activated human TSH receptors, but not LH and FSH receptors, and showed high affinity to TSH receptors in a radioligand receptor assay. The heterodimer also stimulated cAMP production and thymidine incorporation by cultured thyroid cells and increased serum thyroxine levels in TSH-suppressed rats in vivo. This new heterodimeric glycoprotein hormone was named as thyrostimulin based on its thyroid-stimulating activity. The expression of thyrostimulin in the anterior pituitary known to express TSH receptors suggested a paracrine mechanism. The present discovery of a new ligand based on genomic approaches could facilitate the understanding of the physiological roles of extra-thyroid TSH receptor systems and the structural-functional basis of receptor signaling by related glycoprotein hormones.

In this study, we have characterized the beta (2)-adrenoceptor expression by radioligand binding assay, Northern blot analysis and measurement of intracellular cAMP accumulation in a human embryonic lung fibroblast cell line (HEL299 cells). Treatment with TGF-beta (1) caused a time-dependent decrease in beta (2)-adrenoceptor mRNA, and in receptor number after 24 h. Furthermore, nuclear run-on assays showed a 35% reduction in the transcription rate of the beta (2)-adrenoceptor gene with no alteration in stability of the beta (2)-adrenoceptor mRNA. After TGF-beta (1) treatment, the basal, procaterol- and forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulations were also decreased. Cycloheximide inhibited TGF-beta (1)-mediated reduction of beta (2)-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein, whilst alone caused induction of beta (2)-adrenoceptor mRNA without any effect on receptor number. In summary, TGF-beta (1) induces beta (2)-adrenoceptor desensitization through the alteration in adenylyl cyclase activity and down-regulation of beta (2)-adrenoceptor mRNA and protein through the reduction in the rate of beta (2)-adrenoceptor gene transcription.

J	Sanchez, MS; Celis, ME; Schiöth, HB				Sanchez, MS; Celis, ME; Schiöth, HB			Evidence that α-MSH induced grooming is not primarily mediated by any of the cloned melanocortin receptors	NEUROPEPTIDES			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; GAMMA-MSH; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; BETA-ENDORPHIN; ACTH RECEPTOR; PEPTIDES; ANTAGONISTS; BRAIN; MELANOTROPIN	It is well established that melanocortic peptides, such as melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and adrenocorticotropin, induce grooming behavior. The MC3 and MC4 receptors are the MC receptors which are most abundantly expressed in the brain. gamma-MSH, a peptide with preference to the MC3 receptor, however, does not induce grooming. Recent studies have shown that MC4 receptor antagonists are very effective in inhibiting alpha-MSH induced grooming. These data have indicated that grooming behavior in rodents may be mediated by the MC4 receptor. In this study we investigated if the recently developed MC1 receptor selective agonist MS05 was able to induce grooming in comparison with alpha-MSH. The results show that MS05 is effective in inducing grooming after either intracerebroventricular or ventral tegmental area administration in rats. Central administration of either MS05 or alpha-MSH besides grooming also induced stretching, yawning, rearing and locomotion. The results indicate that the earlier hypothesis that the MC4 receptor is the main mediator of grooming behavior has to be modified. Moreover, as this behaviour does not pharmacologically correlate to the profile of any of the five cloned MC receptors, we suggest that alpha-MSH induced grooming may not primarily be mediated by any of these receptors.

Discovery of Novel Delta Opioid Receptor (DOR) Inverse Agonist and Irreversible (Non-Competitive) Antagonists	MOLECULES			English	Article						delta opioid receptor; inverse agonist; irreversible antagonist; non-competitive antagonist; molecular pharmacology	ANALOGS; POTENT; ANTINOCICEPTION; BINDING	The delta opioid receptor (DOR) is a crucial receptor system that regulates pain, mood, anxiety, and similar mental states. DOR agonists, such as SNC80, and DOR-neutral antagonists, such as naltrindole, were developed to investigate the DOR in vivo and as potential therapeutics for pain and depression. However, few inverse agonists and non-competitive/irreversible antagonists have been developed, and none are widely available. This leaves a gap in our pharmacological toolbox and limits our ability to investigate the biology of this receptor. Thus, we designed and synthesized the novel compounds SRI-9342 as an irreversible antagonist and SRI-45128 as an inverse agonist. These compounds were then evaluated in vitro for their binding affinity by radioligand binding, their functional activity by S-35-GTP gamma S coupling, and their cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the human DOR. Both compounds demonstrated high binding affinity and selectivity at the DOR, and both displayed their hypothesized molecular pharmacology of irreversible antagonism (SRI-9342) or inverse agonism (SRI-45128). Together, these results demonstrate that we have successfully designed new inverse agonists and irreversible antagonists of the DOR based on a novel chemical scaffold. These new compounds will provide new tools to investigate the biology of the DOR or even new potential therapeutics.

The aim of this study was to develop a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for the GIPR to enable the assessment of target distribution and drug target engagement in vivo. The GIPR-selective peptide S02-GIP was radiolabeled with Ga-68. The resulting PET tracer [Ga-68]S02-GIP-T4 was evaluated for affinity and specificity to human GIPR (huGIPR). The in vivo GIPR binding of [Ga-68]S02-GIP-T4 as well as the occupancy of a drug candidate with GIPR activity were assessed in nonhuman primates (NHPs) by PET. [Ga-68]S02-GIP-T4 bound with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity to huGIPR in overexpressing cells. In vivo, pancreatic binding in NHPs could be dose-dependently inhibited by coinjection of unlabeled S02-GIP-T4. Finally, subcutaneous pretreatment with a high dose of a drug candidate with GIPR activity led to a decreased pancreatic binding of [Ga-68]S02-GIP-T4, corresponding to a GIPR drug occupancy of almost 90%. [Ga-68]S02-GIP-T4 demonstrated a safe dosimetric profile, allowing for repeated studies in humans. In conclusion, [Ga-68]S02-GIP-T4 is a novel PET biomarker for safe, noninvasive, and quantitative assessment of GIPR target distribution and drug occupancy.

Thus, the development of nanosystems targeting this receptor could be a strategy to both treat and diagnose cancer. Iron-filled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are an optimal platform for theranostic purposes, and the use of a magnetic field can be exploited for cancer magnetic cell sorting and thermal therapy. In this work, we have conjugated an A(3)AR ligand on the surface of iron-filled CNTs with the aim of targeting cells overexpressing A(3)ARs. In particular, two conjugates bearing PEG linkers of different length were designed. A docking analysis of A(3)AR showed that neither CNT nor linker interferes with ligand binding to the receptor; this was confirmed byin vitropreliminary radioligand competition assays on A(3)AR. Encouraged by this result, magnetic cell sorting was applied to a mixture of cells overexpressing or not the A(3)AR in which our compound displayed indiscriminate binding to all cells. Despite this, it is the first time that a GPCR ligand has been anchored to a magnetic nanosystem, thus it opens the door to new applications for cancer treatment.

The synthesized compounds were tested in radioligand binding assay on rat cortex against [H-3]-cytisine and [3H]-methyllycaconitine to measure their affinity for alpha 4 beta 2* and alpha 7* nicotinic receptors. The new derivatives showed some preference for the alpha 4 beta 2* over the alpha 7* subtype, with their affinity being dependent on the endo/exo isomerism and on the methylation degree of the basic nitrogen. The endo primary amines displayed the lowest K-i values on both receptor subtypes. Selected compounds (1a, 2a, 3a, and 6a) were tested on heterologously expressed alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 7, and alpha 3 beta 2 receptors and on SHSY-5Y cells. Compounds 1a and 2a showed alpha 4 beta 2 antagonistic properties while behaved as full agonists on recombinant alpha 7 and on SHSYSY cells.

As observed for the reference PSMA I&T, the Ga-nat/Lu-nat complexes of the respective galactose-, mannose-, and cellobiose-conjugated analogs showed high PSMA affinity. Carbohydration had almost no effect on the lipophilicity, whereas PSMA-mediated internalization was reduced. The specific binding toward human serum albumin (HSA) decreased from 78.6% for [Lu-nat] PSMA I&T to 19.9% for the Lu-nat-labeled cellobiose derivative. Compared to [Ga-68] PSMA I&T, [Ga-68] PSMA galactose displayed lower nonspecific tissue and kidney accumulation but also slightly lower tumor uptake in small-animal positron emission tomography (mu PET) imaging. Biodistribution studies confirmed reduced unspecific uptake in nontarget tissue and decreased renal accumulation of the metabolically stable [Ga-68] PSMA galactose derivative, resulting in overall improved tumor-to-tissue ratios. However, carbohydration has no significant beneficial in vivo effect on the targeting performance of PSMA I&T. Nevertheless, carbohydration expands the repertoire of feasible modifications within the linker area and might be a valuable tool for the future development of PSMA inhibitors with decreased kidney uptake.

Herein we report on reproducibility and reliability of [C-11]FLB 457 binding potential relative to non-displaceable uptake (BPND) following an acute amphetamine challenge. Ten healthy human subjects were studied twice with [C-11]FLB 457 following an acute amphetamine (oral, 0.5 mg kg(-1) dose) challenge on two-separate days approximately one week apart. D-2/3 receptor binding parameters were estimated using a two-tissue compartment kinetic analysis in the cortical regions of interest and cerebellum (reference region). The test-retest variability and intraclass correlation coefficient were assessed for distribution volume (V-T), binding potential relative to plasma concentration (BPP), and BPND of [C-11]FLB 457. The test-retest variability of [C-11]FLB 457 V-T, BPP and BPND were <= 17%, 22% and 11% respectively. These results, which are consistent with the published test-retest variability for this ligand measured under baseline conditions demonstrate that the post-amphetamine [C-11]FLB 457 BPND is reproducible. These data further support the use [C-11]FLB 457 and amphetamine to characterize cortical dopamine transmission in neuropsychiatric disorders.	[Narendran, Rajesh; Himes, Michael; Mason, N.

Patients with schizophrenia show cognitive impairment as a fundamental symptom, and it is proposed that the procognitive properties of some antipsychotics such as olanzapine and clozapine would be, in part, due to the central blockade of 5-HT6 receptors. In this study, we characterized the brain 5-HT6 receptor occupancy of olanzapine, clozapine and chlorpromazine in relation to their pharmacokinetic profiles using in vivo [H-3]GSK215083 binding assay in rat brain. Oral administration of olanzapine (3 mg/kg), clozapine (30 mg/kg) and chlorpromazine (30 mg/kg) produced significant 5-HT6 receptor occupancy in the brain, inhibiting radioligand binding by 88,97 and 81%, respectively. The blood concentrations required to achieve significant occupancy were clinically achievable (9.6, 26.9 and 98.6 nM for olanzapine, clozapine and chlorpromazine, respectively). This data provides preclinical evidence to support the hypothesis that brain 5-HT6 antagonism contributes to the procognitive properties of antipsychotic drugs such as olanzapine and clozapine.

The reduced adiponectin levels are associated with obesity-related metabolic syndrome. Replenishment of this hormone into animal models can improve insulin sensitivity, decrease blood glucose and lipid levels, and prevent the development of atherosclerosis and fatty liver injury. Despite these findings, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we have used affinity chromatography to purify the protein complexes that are associated with adiponectin in human serum. The nature of these adiponectin-binding proteins was analyzed by MS/ MS. Eight proteins from the adiponectin-containing protein mixtures have been identified. Many of them, including thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), histidine-rich glycoprotein, kininogen 1, and alpha 2 macroglobulin (alpha2M), are well-known glycoproteins involved in the regulation of inflammation, angiogenesis, and tissue remodeling. Coimmunoprecipitation and radioligand competitive-binding assays confirmed the direct interactions between adiponectin and alpha2M, or TSP-1. Moreover, these specific bindings were also detected in the serum samples derived from both healthy human subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes. In summary, our study demonstrated that, in the circulation, adiponectin forms protein complexes with other serum proteins. These proteins might serve as the physiological-binding partners of adiponectin and regulate its bioavailability and biological activities.

Objective: To study the serotonin system in PD with positron emission tomography, using the serotonin transporter radioligand [C-11](+)McN5652. Design and Patients: We measured the density of the serotonin transporter and the density of [C-11]WIN35 428-labeled dopamine transporters in the striatum of 13 adults with PD and 13 age- and sex-matched controls. To assess the effects of possible differences in blood flow or brain atrophy, we also measured regional cerebral blood flow and the size of the regions of interest for the caudate nucleus and putamen. Results: Patients with PD showed reductions in the specific distribution volumes of [C-11] (+)McN5652 in the caudate (P<.01) and putamen (P<.01), along with the expected reductions in striatal [C-11]WIN35428 binding (P<.01). There were no reductions in regional cerebral blood flow or the sizes of the regions of interest, mitigating against potential confounding effects of blood flow, brain atrophy, or partial volume effects. Reductions in serotonin transporter binding correlated with ratings of disease staging. Conclusions: These results suggest that the density of serotonin transporters, like that of dopamine transporters, is reduced in the striatum of patients with PD and that these changes are related to disease stage.

ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						parathyroid hormone; parathyroid fragment; bone turnover; histomorphometry; rats	PTH; FRAGMENTS; RECEPTOR; ASSAY	Circulating parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a mixture of PTH-1-84 and carboxy-terminal (C-PTH) fragments. Recently, the "intact" PTH assay was reported to detect not only PTH-(1-84) but also a C-PTH fragment, presumably PTH-(7-84). The purpose of this study was to determine whether PTH-(7-84) antagonizes the PTH-(1-84) effects on bone. Forty-eight rats were thyroparathyroidectomized (TPTX), eight were used as controls and the remaining TPTX rats (10/group) were nephrectomized (Nx) and subsequently given PTH-(1-84), PTH-(7-84), PTH-(1-84) and PTH-(7-84) brought serum calcium and osteoblast activity i.e., bone turnover, to normal levels. Concomitant administration of PTH-(7-84) abrogated these effects. Administration of PTH-(7-84) alone did not further suppress the levels of serum calcium and bone turnover in these TPTX-Nx rats. Moreover, radioligand binding experiments demonstrate that PTH-(7-84) binds specifically to SaOS cells and is equally displaced by both PTH-(1-84) and (7-84), but only partially displaced by PTH-(1-34). These data indicate that PTH-(7-84) antagonizes PTH-(1-84) effect not only on serum calcium but also on osteoblasts to affect bone turnover.

Attempts to elucidate the specific segment(s) that define the receptor ligand-binding pocket have produced less than definitive and sometimes conflicting results. On this basis, the present work identified an amino acid sequence of the TP receptor that is directly involved in ligand binding. Mapping of this domain was confirmed by two separate approaches: photoaffinity labeling and site-specific antibodies. The newly synthesized, biotinylated photoaffinity probe, SQBAzide, was first shown to specifically label TP receptor protein. Sequential digestion of this protein with CNBr/trypsin revealed photolabeling of a 2.9-kDa peptide. Using anti-peptide antibodies directed against different regions of the receptor protein, it was established that this peptide represents the predicted cleavage product for CNBr/trypsin and corresponds to amino acids Arg(174)-Met(202) of the receptor protein. Furthermore, antibody screening revealed that inhibition of the amino acid region Cys(183)-Asp(193) was critical for radioligand binding and platelet aggregation, whereas inhibition of Gly(172)-Cys(183) was not. Collectively these findings provide evidence that ligands interact with amino acids contained within the C-terminal portion of the third extracellular domain (ED3) of the receptor protein. This information should be of significant value in the study of TP receptor structure and signaling.

All cell types studied express the glucocorticoid receptor of molecular weight 97 KDa. In addition, in astrocytes derived from aged mouse cerebral hemispheres a smaller molecular weight polypeptide reacting with anti-glucocorticoid receptor antibody was also demonstrated. No difference in the amount of the 97 KDa glucocorticoid receptor between early and late C-6 2B cells was observed, whereas the astrocytes from aged cerebral hemispheres contained considerably reduced amounts of the glucocorticoid receptor compared to C-6 2B cells. Late passage C-6 2B cells were immunofluorescence labelled with the anti-glucocorticoid antibody, the receptor being almost exclusively present in the cytoplasm, with particular concentration in the perinuclear region. The presence of glucocorticoid receptor of molecular weight 97 KDa in glial cells corroborates and expands the existing data based on radioligand binding and immunocytochemical studies. These cell populations can be exploited as a model system for the study of the effects of glucocorticoids on senescence and brain aging. (C) 2000 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

These biological properties are mediated by the heparan sulfate moiety, Rather little is known about the protein core's mediation of functions. We have recently discovered that fibroblast growth factor-7 (FGF7) binds to perlecan protein core and that exogenous perlecan efficiently reconstitutes FGF7 mitogenic activity in perlecan-deficient cells. In this report we examined the specific binding of FGF7 to various domains and subdomains of perlecan protein core. Using several experimental approaches including overlay protein assays, radioligand binding experiments, and the yeast two-hybrid system, me demonstrate that FGF7 binds specifically to the N-terminal half of domain III and to a lesser extent to domain V, with affinity constants in the range of 60 nM. Thus, perlecan protein core should be considered a novel biological ligand for FGF7, an interaction that could influence cancer growth and tissue remodeling.

Three-step syntheses, consisting of N-alkylations using standard procedures as well as microwaves, were carried out. Crystal structures were determined for compounds 7-9. All of the synthesized 5,5-dimethylhydantoins were tested for their affinity to alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors (alpha(1)-AR) using both in vitro and in silico methods. Most of them displayed higher affinity (Ki < 127.9 nM) to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor than urapidil in radioligand binding assay. Docking to two subtypes of adrenergic receptors, alpha(1A) and alpha(1B), was conducted. Selected compounds were tested for their activity towards two alpha(1)-AR subtypes. All of them showed intrinsic antagonistic activity. Moreover, for two compounds (1 and 5), which possess o-methoxyphenylpiperazine fragments, strong activity (IC50 < 100 nM) was observed. Some representatives (3 and 5), which contain alkyl linker, proved selectivity towards alpha(1A)-AR, while two compounds with 2-hydroxypropyl linker (11 and 13) to alpha(1B)-AR. Finally, hypotensive activity was examined in rats. The most active compound (5) proved not only a lower effective dose than urapidil but also a stronger effect than prazosin.

As a promising small molecular probe, FAP inhibitor (FAPI) shows the specific binding to FAP. This study aimed to explore a novel molecular probe -[(99)mTc]Tc-HYNIC-FAPI targeting CAFs. The in vitro characteristics of the probe were also evaluated. The FAPI targeting FAP was designed, synthesized and conjugated with the chelator 6-hydrazinylnicotinic acid (HYNIC) for radiolabeling with (99)mTc. The radiolabeling yield, radiochemical purity and stability were evaluated by Instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) and High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Lipophilicity was performed by the distribution coefficient test. The binding and migration ability of the probe was assessed using the FAP transfected tumor cell line. The radiolabeling yield of -[(99)mTc]Tc-HYNIC-FAPI was (97.29 +/- 0.46) %. The radiochemical purity was more than 90% and kept stable until 6 h. The radioligand was shown as lower lipophilicity, of which logD7.4 value was - 2.38 +/- 0.13. In vitro experiments, the results indicated that the probe showed binding properties, and inhibited the migration of tumor cells. The novel -[(99)mTc] Tc-HYNIC-FAPI probe was successfully radiosynthesized and exhibited good radiochemical purity, stability and in vitro binding ability to tumor cells. The -[(99)mTc]Tc- HYNIC-FAPI will be a promising SPECT/CT imaging probe.

EDCs are easily absorbed into the body and have the ability to mimic or block hormone function. The radioligand binding assay based on the estrogen receptors binding affinity is widely used to detect estrogenic EDCs but is limited to radioactive substances and requires specific conditions. As an alternative, we developed a human cell-based dimerization assay for detecting EDC-mediated ER-alpha (ER alpha) dimerization using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). The resultant novel BRET-based on the ER alpha dimerization assay was used to identify the binding affinity of 17 beta-estradiol (E2), 17 alpha-estradiol, corticosterone, diethylhexyl phthalate, bisphenol A, and 4-nonylphenol with ER alpha by measuring the corresponding BRET signals. Consequently, the BRET signals from five chemicals except corticosterone showed a dose-dependent sigmoidal curve for ER alpha, and these chemicals were suggested as positive chemicals for ER alpha. In contrast, corticosterone, which induced a BRET signal comparable to that of the vehicle control, was suggested as a negative chemical for ER alpha. Therefore, these results were consistent with the results of the existing binding assay for ER alpha and suggested that a novel BRET system can provide information about EDCs-mediated dimerization to ER alpha.

For gliomas only little information exists. Therefore, we aimed to correlate PSMA expression in gliomas to tumor metabolism by L[S-methyl-C-11]methionine (MET) PET and survival. Therefore, immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for isocitrate dehydrogenase 1-R132H (IDH1-R132H) mutation and PSMA expression was performed on the paraffin embedded tissue samples of 122 treatmentnaive glioma patients. The IHC results were then related to the pre-therapeutic semiquantitative MET PET data and patients' survival. Vascular PSMA expression was observed in 26 of 122 samples and was rather specific for high-grade gliomas ([HGG] 81% of glioblastoma multiforme, 10% of WHO grade III and just 2% of grade II gliomas). Significantly higher amounts of gliomas without verifiable IDH1-R132H mutation showed vascular PSMA expression. Significantly shorter median survival times were seen for patients with vascular PSMA staining in all tumors as well as HGG only. Additionally, significantly higher numbers of PSMA staining vessels were found in tumors with high amino acid metabolic rates. Vascular PSMA expression in gliomas was seen as a high-grade specific feature associated with elevated amino acid metabolism and short survival.

Its inactivation leads to a continuous immune recruitment, cytokine expression modification and a specific humoral autoimmune response against the astrocytic extracellular matrix but without brain lesions or cell lysis. To assess the impact of Cx43 deletion on the brain's inflammatory response, TSPO expression was studied by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with a specific radioligand, [F-18]FEPPA, in basal conditions or upon Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammatory challenge. Astroglial Cx43-deleted mice underwent [F-18]FEPPA PET/CT dynamic imaging with or without LPS injection (5 mg/kg) 24 h before imaging. Quantification and pharmacokinetic data modelling with a 2TCM-1K compartment model were performed. After collecting the mice brains, TSPO expression was quantified and localized by Western blot and FISH analysis. We found that astroglial Cx43 deficiency does not significantly alter TSPO expression in the basal state as observed with [F-18]FEPPA PET imaging, FISH and Western blot analysis. However, deletion of astrocyte Cx43 abolishes the LPS-induced TSPO increase. Autoimmune encephalopathy observed in astroglial Cx43-deleted mice does not involve TSPO overexpression. Consistent with previous studies showing a unique inflammatory status in the absence of astrocyte Cx43, we show that a deficient expression of astrocytic Cx43 protects the animals from LPS-induced neuroinflammation as addressed by TSPO expression.

However, it is unclear which specific serotonergic receptors are involved in the effects. A large body of preclinical research supports a specific role of serotonin 1B receptors (5-HT(1B)Rs) in aggression and impulsivity, but this has never been evaluated in humans. METHODS: Nineteen incarcerated violent offenders and 24 healthy control nonoffenders were included and examined with positron emission tomography, using the radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 for quantification of cerebral 5-HT1BR binding in three regions of interest: the anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and striatum. RESULTS: Group status significantly moderated the association between striatal 5-HT(1B)Rs and trait anger (difference in slopes, p(corrected) = .04). In the violent offender group, striatal 5-HT1BR binding was positively correlated with self-reported trait anger (p = .0004), trait psychopathy (p = .008), and level of psychopathy according to the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (p = .02). We found no group differences in 5-HT1BR binding. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate for the first time in humans a specific involvement of 5-HT1BR binding in anger and psychopathy. 5-HT(1B)Rs putatively represent a molecular target for development of pharmacologic antiaggressive treatments.

Here we propose a modification of the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) to take into account the contribution of skull activity to the radioactivity kinetic pattern in cerebellum and target regions. It consists of the introduction of an additional parameter for each volume of interest (s(T)) and one for the cerebellum (s(R)), corresponding to the fraction of skull activity contaminating these structures. Using five rat positron emission tomography experiments, we applied the modified SRTM (SRTMc), which resulted in excellent fits. As a relative means of comparison of results, we applied factor analysis (FA) to decompose dynamic data into images corresponding to brain and skull activity. With the skull factor images, we estimated the "true'' s(T) and s(R) values, ultimately permitting us to fix the sR value. Parameters obtained with the SRTMc were closely correlated with values obtained from FA-corrected data. In conclusion, we propose an efficient method for reliable quantification of dopamine D-2/3 receptors with single-injection [F-18]fallypride scans that is potentially applicable to human studies where F-18 skull accumulation compromises binding parameter estimation.

J	Wang, HY; Flournoy, N; Kpamegan, E				Wang, HaiYing; Flournoy, Nancy; Kpamegan, Eloi			A new bounded log-linear regression model	METRIKA			English	Article						Asymptotics; Consistency; Linear model; Logistic model; Maximum likelihood estimation; Parameter dependent support	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; 4-PARAMETER LOGISTIC MODEL; TRANSLATION PARAMETER; END-POINT; CURVES; RADIOLIGAND; BIOASSAY; EVALUATE; QUALITY; PROTEIN	In this paper we introduce a new regression model in which the response variable is bounded by two unknown parameters. A special case is a bounded alternative to the four parameter logistic model. The four parameter model which has unbounded responses is widely used, for instance, in bioassays, nutrition, genetics, calibration and agriculture. In reality, the responses are often bounded although the bounds may be unknown, and in that situation, our model reflects the data-generating mechanism better. Complications arise for the new model, however, because the likelihood function is unbounded, and the global maximizers are not consistent estimators of unknown parameters. Although the two sample extremes, the smallest and the largest observations, are consistent estimators for the two unknown boundaries, they have a slow convergence rate and are asymptotically biased. Improved estimators are developed by correcting for the asymptotic biases of the two sample extremes in the one sample case; but even these consistent estimators do not obtain the optimal convergence rate. To obtain efficient estimation, we suggest using the local maximizers of the likelihood function, i.e., the solution to the likelihood equations. We prove that, with probability approaching one as the sample size goes to infinity, there exists a solution to the likelihood equation that is consistent at the rate of the square root of the sample size and it is asymptotically normally distributed.

Recent findings from animal experiments suggest that 5-HT reuptake inhibition in brain is related to pain reduction. However, there has been no report of 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) occupancy by tramadol at clinical doses in humans. In the present study, we investigated 5-HTT occupancy by tramadol in five subjects receiving various doses of tramadol by using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with the radioligand [C-11]DASB. Our data showed that mean 5-HTT occupancies in the thalamus by single doses of tramadol were 34.7% at 50mg and 50.2% at 100mg. The estimated median effective dose (ED50) of tramadol was 98.1mg, and the plasma concentration was 0.33g/ml 2h after its administration; 5-HTT occupancy by tramadol was dose-dependent. We estimated 5-HTT occupancy at 78.7% upon taking an upper limit dose (400mg) of tramadol. The results of the present study support the finding that 5-HTT inhibition is involved in the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of tramadol in humans, and a clinical dose of tramadol sufficiently inhibits 5-HTT reuptake; this inhibition is similar to that shown by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

Oxytocic plant cyclotides as templates for peptide G protein-coupled receptor ligand design	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						circular plant peptide; peptide ligand design; uterotonic; chemical pharmacology; peptide drugs	CYCLIC-CYSTINE-KNOT; KALATA B1; UTERINE CONTRACTILITY; HUMAN MYOMETRIUM; DRUG DESIGN; VASOPRESSIN; ANTAGONISTS; BINDING; AGONIST; MECHANISM	Cyclotides are plant peptides comprising a circular backbone and three conserved disulfide bonds that confer them with exceptional stability. They were originally discovered in Oldenlandia affinis based on their use in traditional African medicine to accelerate labor. Recently, cyclotides have been identified in numerous plant species of the coffee, violet, cucurbit, pea, potato, and grass families. Their unique structural topology, high stability, and tolerance to sequence variation make them promising templates for the development of peptide-based pharmaceuticals. However, the mechanisms underlying their biological activities remain largely unknown; specifically, a receptor for a native cyclotide has not been reported hitherto. Using bioactivity-guided fractionation of an herbal peptide extract known to indigenous healers as "kalata-kalata," the cyclotide kalata B7 was found to induce strong contractility on human uterine smooth muscle cells. Radioligand displacement and second messenger-based reporter assays confirmed the oxytocin and vasopressin V-1a receptors, members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, as molecular targets for this cyclotide. Furthermore, we show that cyclotides can serve as templates for the design of selective G protein-coupled receptor ligands by generating an oxytocin-like peptide with nanomolar affinity. This nonapeptide elicited dose-dependent contractions on human myometrium. These observations provide a proof of concept for the development of cyclotide-based peptide ligands.

Binding assay was conducted using synthetic amyloid-beta (A beta) fibrils, fluorescence microscopy, and autoradiogram in three postmortem AD brains. Pharmacokinetics of [F-18]FACT was assessed using 12 Crj:CD-1 (ICR) mice. In vivo binding ability with brain amyloid was investigated using amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse. Clinical PET scanning using [F-18]FACT was performed in ten healthy controls and ten mild cognitive impairment and ten AD patients. [F-18]FACT showed high binding affinity for synthetic A beta fibrils, preferential binding to dense cored plaques in brain sections, and excellent brain uptake and rapid clearance in mice. Injection in APP mice resulted in specific in vivo labeling of amyloid deposits in the brain. PET scans of AD patients showed significantly higher [F-18]FACT uptake in the neocortex compared to controls (P < 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test). [F-18]FACT is a promising agent for imaging dense A beta plaques in AD.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine MF-induced changes in the activity of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex, as well as dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors in the striatum of adult Wistar rats, considering their involvement in motor behavior regulation. Experimental animals were continuously exposed to extremely low frequency MF (ELF-MF, 50 Hz, 0.5 mT) for 1, 3, and 7 days. Subsequently, binding properties (K-d and B-max) of receptors were determined by in vitro radioligand receptor binding assays. It was shown that the affinity of serotonin 5-HT2A receptors decreased and their density increased in the prefrontal cortex of rats after ELF-MF exposure. Regarding affinity, this effect was duration-dependent and most prominent after 7-day of ELF-MF exposure. In contrast to serotonin 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex, ELF-MF had no significant effect on the affinity and density of dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors in the striatum. We can conclude that continuous exposure to ELF-MF up to 7 days affects cortical serotonergic neurotransmission, whereby intensity of these changes depends on ELF-MF exposure duration.

Pretreatment of the cells with 5 or 20 nM risperidone, followed by removal of the drug from the media, renders the 5-HT7 receptors unresponsive to 10 mu M 5-HT for at least 24 h. Thus, risperidone seems to be producing a rapid, long-lasting inactivation of the h5-HT7 receptor. Whole-cell radioligand binding studies indicate that risperidone interacts in an irreversible or pseudo-irreversible manner with the h5-HT7 receptor, thus producing the inactivation. Internalization of the h5-HT7 receptor was not detected by monitoring green fluorescent protein-labeled fluorescent forms of the h5-HT7 receptor exposed to 20 nM risperidone. Ten other antagonists were tested for h5-HT7-inactivating properties, and only 9-OH-risperidone and methiothepin were found to demonstrate the same anomalous properties as risperidone. These results indicate that the h5-HT7 receptor may possess unique structural features that allow certain drugs to induce a conformation resulting in an irreversible interaction in the intact membrane environment. This may indicate that the h5-HT7 receptor is part of a subfamily of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) possessing this property or that many GPCRs have the potential to be irreversibly blocked, but only select drugs can induce this effect. At the very least, the possibility that highly prescribed drugs, such as risperidone, are irreversibly antagonizing GPCR function in vivo is noteworthy.

Unlike the previously described allosteric GABA(B) receptor modulator CGP7930 (2,6-Di-tert-butyl-4-(3-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-propyl)-phenol), these compounds did not enhance GABA(B) receptor-mediated guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) [GTP(gamma)S-35] binding in native or recombinant cell membrane preparations. Similarly, in a competition binding assay using the antagonist radioligand [H-3]CGP62349, CGP7930, but not the other compounds, enhanced the affinities of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) for native GABA(B) receptors from rat brain cortex. Finally, in a cellular assay (Ca2+ signaling in a recombinant cell line), CGP7930 was again the only compound found to enhance the GABA response. It is concluded that the arylalkylamines, amino acids and dipeptides tested do not act as allosteric modulators at native and recombinant GABA(B) receptors. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Radioligand binding studies demonstrated significant levels of sigma receptors in the brain and heart, where cocaine interacts preferentially with the sigma(1) subtype. In behavioral pharmacological studies using mice, nine novel sigma receptor antagonists significantly attenuated cocaine-induced convulsions, while structural analogs with weak interactions with sigma receptors were ineffective. In contrast to the protection provided by the antagonists, a classical sigma receptor agonist exacerbated the convulsive effects of cocaine. The antagonists also attenuated cocaine-induced lethality, with the best compound protecting against death even when administered as a post-treatment. At doses where the antagonists had no effect on baseline locomotor activity, they significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine, suggesting their ability to block the psychomotor as well as the toxic effects of cocaine. To further validate that the anti-cocaine effects were achieved by interfering with cocaine's access to sigma receptors, antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against sigma(1) receptors were shown to attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine. Together, the studies support the involvement of sigma receptors, particularly the sigma(1), subtype, in the behavioral effects of cocaine. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, quantification of the regional [C-11](+)McN5652 binding potential in vivo is a controversial issue because of its complex characteristics. The authors examined the regional differences in nonspecific binding and proposed simple methods for estimating the binding potential of [C-11](+)McN5652. The regional difference in nonspecific binding was evaluated by the activity ratio of the thalamus compared with the cerebellum for inactive-isomer [C-11](-)McN5652 and [C-11](+)McN5652 saturation studies. The distribution volume of the thalamus was approximately 1.16 times larger than that of the cerebellum. The thalamus-to-cerebellum distribution volume ratio was estimated by nonlinear least square and graphical methods, with and without arterial input function. The graphical method with k(2)' without blood sampling was practical and most applicable for estimation of the distribution volume ratio because this method is more stable than the nonlinear least square method in the simulation study. Binding potential estimated with the distribution volume ratio of [C-11](+)McN5652 and the correction with distribution volume ratio of [C-11](-)McN5652 represent the most reliable parameters for the assessment of scrotonin transporter binding.

However, despite considerable efforts, there are very few approved drugs targeting this class of seven transmembrane domain receptors to date. In recent years, the importance of including binding kinetics in drug discovery campaigns was emphasized. Therefore, kinetic insight into chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions could help to address this issue. Moreover, it could additionally deepen our understanding of the selectivity and promiscuity of the chemokine-chemokine receptor network. Here, we describe the application, optimization and validation of a homogenous Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA) for real-time kinetic profiling of chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions on the example of ACKR3 and CXCL12. The principle of the SPA is the detection of radioligand binding to receptors reconstituted into nanodiscs by scintillation light. No receptor modifications are required. The nanodiscs provide a native-like environment for receptors and allow for full control over bilayer composition and size. The continuous assay format enables the monitoring of binding reactions in real-time, and directly accounts for non-specific binding and potential artefacts. Minor adaptations additionally facilitate the determination of equilibrium binding metrics, making the assay a versatile tool for the study of receptor-ligand interactions.

The development of radioligand such as the 18F-flortaucipir (AV-1451) has provided us with the opportunity to assess the underlying tau pathology in various etiologies of dementia. For the purpose of this article, we aimed to evaluate the utility of 18F-AV-1451 in the differential diagnosis of various neurodegenerative disorders. We used PubMed to look for the latest, peer-reviewed, and informative articles. The scope of discussion included the role of 18F-AV-1451 positron emission tomography (PET) to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and Parkinson's disease with dementia (PIN)). We also discussed if the tau burden identified by neuroimaging correlated well with the clinical severity and identified the various challenges of 18F-AV-1451 PET. We concluded that although the role of 18F-AV-1451 seems promising in the neuroimaging of AD, the benefit appears uncertain when it comes to the non-Alzheimer's tauopathies. More research is required to identify the off-target binding sites of 18F-AV-1451 to determine its clinical utility in the future.

All seven ligands exhibited nanomolar affinity for sigma(1) receptors (K-i(sigma(1)) = 0.47 - 12.1 nM) and moderate selectivity over sigma(2) receptors (K-i(sigma(2))/K-i(sigma(1)) = 2 - 44). Compound 8, with the best selectivity among these ligands, was selected for radiolabeling and further evaluation. Radioligand [F-18]8 was prepared via nucleophilic F-18-substitution of the corresponding tosylate precursor, with an overall isolated radiochemical yield of 12-35%, a radiochemical purity of greater than 99%, and molar activity of 94 - 121 GBq/mu mol. Biodistribution studies of [F-18]8 in mice demonstrated high initial brain uptake at 2 min. Pretreatment with SA4503 resulted in significantly reduced brain-to-blood ratio (70% - 75% at 30 min). Ex vivo autoradiography in ICR mice demonstrated high accumulation of the radiotracer in sigma(1) receptor-rich brain areas. These findings suggest that [F-18]8 could be a lead compound for further structural modifications to develop potential brain imaging agents for sigma(1) receptors.

Tissue expression of Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 alpha-subunits in human post-mortem brain tissue was confirmed in immunoblot analysis using a panel of specific monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitation experiments using toxin-prelabeled Kv1 channels revealed that all toxin-sensitive Kv1 channels in human hippocampus contained either a Kv1.1 or Kv1.2 alpha-subunit with the majority being composed of Kv1.1/Kv1.2 heterotetramers. Receptor autoradiography suggested Kv1.1/Kv1.2 channel expression in the molecular layer of dentate gyrus. In accordance, immunohistochemical experiments also observed Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 alpha-subunits in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus, in addition to the CA3 stratum lucidum and the CA1 stratum oriens. These findings indicate expression in axons and terminals of hippocampal pathways, namely the perforant path, the mossy fiber pathway and the Schaffer collaterals. Herein we present the first direct demonstration that Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 channel proteins are targeted to distinct compartments of the human hippocampal formation and that this expression pattern largely reflects their distribution profile in murine brain.

Structure-Activity Relationships of the Sustained Effects of Adenosine A2A Receptor Agonists Driven by Slow Dissociation Kinetics	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; A(2A) RECEPTOR; A(2A)-ADENOSINE RECEPTOR; ADENYLYL-CYCLASE; BINDING; DESENSITIZATION; CELLS; GPCR; RAT; ACTIVATION	The duration of action of adenosine A(2A) receptor (A2A) agonists is critical for their clinical efficacy, and we sought to better understand how this can be optimized. The in vitro temporal response profiles of a panel of A2A agonists were studied using cAMP assays in recombinantly (CHO) and endogenously (SH-SY5Y) expressing cells. Some agonists (e.g., 3cd; UK-432,097) but not others (e.g., 3ac; CGS-21680) demonstrated sustained wash-resistant agonism, where residual receptor activation continued after washout. The ability of an antagonist to reverse pre-established agonist responses was used as a surrogate read-out for agonist dissociation kinetics, and together with radioligand binding studies suggested a role for slow off-rate in driving sustained effects. One compound, 3ch, showed particularly marked sustained effects, with a reversal t(1/2) > 6 hours and close to maximal effects that remained for at least 5 hours after washing. Based on the structure-activity relationship of these compounds, we suggest that lipophilic N6 and bulky C2 substituents can promote stable and long-lived binding events leading to sustained agonist responses, although a high compound logD is not necessary. This provides new insight into the binding interactions of these ligands and we anticipate that this information could facilitate the rational design of novel long-acting A2A agonists with improved clinical efficacy.

We set out to evaluate the novel compound, [I-125] WYE-230949, as a potential radionuclide imaging agent for the histamine H-3 receptor in brain. [I-125] WYE-230949 had a high in vitro affinity for the rat histamine H-3 receptor (K-d of 6.9 nM). The regional distribution of [I-125] WYE-230949 binding sites in rat brain, demonstrated by in vitro autoradiography, was consistent with the known distribution of the histamine H-3 receptor. Rat brain uptake of intravenously injected [I-125] WYE-230949 was low (0.11 % ID/g) and the ratio of specific: non-specific binding was less than 1.4, as determined by ex vivo autoradiography. In plasma, metabolism of [I-125] WYE-230949 into a less lipophilic species occurred, such that less than 38% of the parent compound remained 30 minutes after injection. Brain uptake and metabolism of [I-125] WYE-230949 were increased and specific binding was reduced in anaesthetised compared to conscious rats. [I-125]WYE230949 is not a potential radiotracer for imaging rat histamine H-3 receptors in vivo due to low brain uptake, in vivo metabolism of the parent compound and low specific binding.

Hydrophobic residues at position 10 of α-conotoxin PnIA influence subtype selectivity between α7 and α3β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Alpha-conotoxin; Structure-function relationship	PHASE PEPTIDE-SYNTHESIS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BINDING PROTEIN; HOMOLOG ACHBP; SUBUNIT; CHANNEL; TARGETS; NACHR	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are a diverse class of ligand-gated ion channels involved in neurological conditions such as neuropathic pain and Alzheimer's disease. alpha-Conotoxin [A10L]PnIA is a potent and selective antagonist of the mammalian alpha 7 nAChR with a key binding interaction at position 10. We now describe a molecular analysis of the receptor-ligand interactions that determine the role of position 10 in determining potency and selectivity for the alpha 7 and alpha 3 beta 2 nAChR subtypes. Using electrophysiological and radioligand binding methods on a suite of [A10L]PnIA analogs we observed that hydrophobic residues in position 10 maintained potency at both subtypes whereas charged or polar residues abolished alpha 7 binding. Molecular docking revealed dominant hydrophobic interactions with several alpha 7 and alpha 3 beta 2 receptor residues via a hydrophobic funnel. Incorporation of norleucine (Nle) caused the largest (8-fold) increase in affinity for the alpha 7 subtype (Ki = 44 nM) though selectivity reverted to alpha 3 beta 2 (IC50 = 0.7 nM). It appears that the placement of a single methyl group determines selectivity between alpha 7 and alpha 3 beta 2 nAChRs via different molecular determinants.

Therefore, we performed ex vivo explorations with [(125)]-CLINDE, a TSPO-specific radioligand, to follow the time course of TSPO expression, in parallel with lesion progression, over 90 days after induction of cerebral excitotoxicity in rats intrastriatally injected with quinolinic acid. Biodistribution data showed a significant increase in CLINDE uptake on the injured side from 1 days postlesion (dpl); the maximal striatal binding values evidenced a plateau between 7 and 30 dpl. [I-125]-CLINDE binding was displaced from the lesion by PK11195, suggesting TSPO specificity. These results were confirmed by ex vivo autoradiography. Combined immunohistochemical studies showed a marked increase in microglial expression in the lesion, peaking at 14 dpl, and astrocytic reactivity enhanced at 7 and 14 dpl, whereas a prominent neuronal cell loss was observed. At 90 dpl, CLINDE binding and immunoreactivity targeting activated microglia, astrogliosis, and neuronal cell density returned to a basal level. These results show that both neuroinflammation and neuronal loss profiles occurred concomitantly and appeared to be transitory processes.

Discovery of (-)-7-methyl-2-<i>exo</i>-[3′-(6-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]fluoropyridin-2-yl)-5′-pyridinyl]-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, a radiolabeled antagonist for cerebral nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ((α4β2-nAChR) with optimal positron emission tomography Imaging properties	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO TRACER; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; PET; ANALOGS; BINDING; EPIBATIDINE; RADIOLIGAND; PHARMACOLOGY; LIGAND; DERIVATIVES	Several isomers of 7-methyl-2-exo-([F-18]fluoropyridinyl-5'-pyridinyl)-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane have been developed as radioligands with optimized brain kinetics for PET imaging of nAChR. The binding assay demonstrated that all isomers are beta-nAChR selective ligands with K-i = 0.02-0.3 nM. The experimental lipophilicity values of all isomers were in the. optimal range for the cerebral radioligands (log D-7.4=0.67-0.99). The isomers with higher binding affinity manifested slow baboon brain kinetics, whereas the isomer with the lowest binding affinity (K-i=0.3 nM) ((-)-7-methyl-2-exo-[3'-(6-[F]fluoropyridin-2-yl)-5'-pyridinyl]-7-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane, [F-18](-)-6c) and greatest lipophilicity (log D-7.4=0.99) exhibited optimal brain kinetics. [F-18](-)-6c manifests a unique combination of the optimally rapid brain kinetics, high BP and brain uptake, and favorable metabolic profile. Pharmacological studies showed that (-)-6c is an alpha 4 beta 2-nAChR antagonist with low side effects in mice. This combination of imaging properties suggests that [F-18]-(-)-6c is a potentially superior replacement for 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 and 6-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380, the only available nAChR PET radioligands for humans.

We show here that AM is a powerful pain-inducing neuropeptide. AM-like immunoreactivity is widely distributed in both CGRP-containing and lectin IB4-binding nociceptors in dorsal root ganglion and axon terminals in the superficial dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord. Specific binding sites for the radioligand, [I-125]AM13-52 as well as immunoreactivity for receptor markers such as the calcitonin receptor-like receptor and three receptor-activity-modifying proteins are localized in the superficial dorsal horn, demonstrating the existence of AM/CGRP receptors in this region. Intrathecal injection of rat AM1-50, dose- and time-dependently, induced long-lasting heat hyperalgesia and increased the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 beta in the dorsal horn. Pre- and post-treatments with the AM receptor antagonist AM22-52 and PI3 kinase inhibitors (LY294002 and Wortmannin) significantly blocked or reversed AM-induced heat hyperalgesia. Pre- and posttreatments-with AM22-52 and Wortmannin also significantly blocked or reversed intraplantar capsaicin-incluced heat hyperalgesia. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AM acts as a pain-inducing peptide in the dorsal horn. By activating specific receptors (likely AM2) and the PI3K/Akt/GSK3 beta signaling pathway, AM could play a significant role in long-lasting heat hypersensitivity and inflammatory heat hyperalgesia.

Functional GABA(B) receptors are assembled from two subunits GABA(B(1)) (GABA(B) receptor subtype 1) and GABA(B(2)). For the GABA(B(1)) subunit, which binds the neurotransmitter GABA, two variants GABA(B(1a)) (GABA(B) receptor subtype 1 variant a) and GABA(B(1b)) have been identified. They differ at the very N-terminus of their large glycosylated ECD (extracellular domain). To simplify the structural characterization, we designed truncated GABA(B(1)) receptors to identify the minimal functional domain which still binds a competitive radioligand and leads to a functional, GABA-responding receptor when co-expressed with GABA(B(2)). We show that it is necessary to include all the portion of the ECD encoded by exon 6 to exon 14. Furthermore, we studied mutant GABA(B(1b)) receptors, in which single or all potential N-glycosylation sites are removed. The absence of oligosaccharides does not impair receptor function, suggesting that the unglycosylated ECD of GABA(B(1)) can be used for further functional or structural investigations.

Methods: We produced transgenic mice overexpressing the Asp567Gly human FSHR under the control of a 1.5kb 5'-flanking region fragment of its promoter. Results: Mice were phenotypically normal and fertile. In males, mRNA could be detected in the testis and the brain, indicating that the 1.5kb promoter fragment drives expression not only in the gonads. The testis weight/body weight ratio and the testosterone levels in transgenic and non-transgenic littermates were similar. By in situ hybridisation we found that the transgenic FSHR was highly expressed in Sertoli cells, spermatocytes and round spermatids. However, a radioligand receptor assay failed to show a significant difference in total FSHR binding sites in testis homogenates of transgenic and wild type animals, suggesting that the transgenic FSHR is probably not translated into functional receptor protein. Conclusion: A 1.5kb 5'-region of the human FSHR drives mRNA expression of the transgene in the testis but leads to ectopic expression in germ cells and in the brain. No phenotypic consequences could be documented due to the lack of protein expression. (Asian J Androl 2003 Dec; 5: 267-275).

Inhibition of the 5-HT (3 muM)-induced response by 10 muM Ca 2+ reached a plateau at 68.5% inhibition, with half-maximal effect at 2.6 mM, This was due to an increase in EC., from 2.35 to 3.87 LM and a 30% reduction in I-max. Ca2+ also resulted in the inhibition of binding of both 5-HT3 receptor agonist [H-3]m-clorophenylbi [3 2 +) to guanide and antagonist [H-3]granisetron due to an increase in K-d with no change in B (max). An increase in EC50, from 2.6 0 mM Ca 4.7 PM (10 inM Ca2'), with no change in maximal [Ca 2+]i, was observed from Ca2' imaging studies. Largely similar effects were observed with Mg2'. The combined data suggest that Ca2+ acting at a site that directly or indirectly influences the agonist binding site plays a significant role in its inhibitory effect at the 5-HT3 receptor.

Group II mGlu receptor agonists inhibited voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC) currents in a reversible and concentration-dependent manner with a rank order of potency being LY354740> DCG-IV > L-CCG-I > glutamate >>1S,3R-ACPD > NAAG. The maximum degree of inhibition obtained was similar for all drugs tested, saturating at about 33-41%, except for NAAG that had a non saturating effect of 50% at 1mM. Two novel group II mGlu receptor antagonists, LY341495 and Ro 65-3479, reversed VGCC current inhibition by LY354740 with pK(B) values of 7.0 and 6.3, respectively. In a subpopulation of Golgi cells, the antagonistic effect of LY341495 was only partial, suggesting a remaining effect of group I mGlu receptors. This was confirmed by experiments with S-DHPG, a selective group I mGlu receptor agonist. These experiments suggest that Golgi cells of the cerebellum express group II mGlu receptors that couple to the inhibition of VGCCs. Therefore, inhibition of VGCCs in cerebellar Golgi cells is a useful model system to evaluate novel group II mGlu receptor ligands. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the basis of preliminary data as a diagnostic ligand, the isomer rhPSMA-7.3 is a promising candidate for potential endoradiotherapy. The aim of this preclinical evaluation was to assess the biodistribution, dosimetry, and therapeutic efficacy of F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 in comparison to the established therapeutic agent Lu-177-PSMA I&T (imaging and therapy). Methods: The biodistribution of F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T was determined in LNCaP tumor-bearing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice after sacrifice at defined time points up to 7 d (n = 5). Organs and tumors were dissected, percentage injected dose per gram (%ID/g) was determined, and dosimetry was calculated using OLINDA/EXM, version 1.0. The therapeutic efficacy of a single 30-MBq dose of F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 (n = 7) was compared with that of Lu-177-PSMA I&T in treatment groups (n = 7) and control groups (n = 6-7) using C4-2 tumor-bearing SCID mice by evaluating tumor growth and survival over 6 wk after treatment. Results: The biodistribution of F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 revealed fast blood clearance (0.63 %ID/g at 1 h after injection), and the highest activity uptake was in the spleen and kidneys, particularly in the first hour (33.25 %ID/g and 207.6 %ID/g, respectively, at 1 h after injection), indicating a renal excretion pathway. Compared with Lu-177-PSMA I&T, F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 exhibited an initial (1 h) 2.6-fold higher tumor uptake in LNCaP xenografts and a longer retention (4.5 %ID/g vs. 0.9 %ID/g at 168 h). The tumor dose of F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 was substantially higher (e.g., 7.47 vs. 1.96 mGy/MBq at 200 mm(3)) than that of Lu-177-PSMA I&T. In most organs, absorbed doses were higher for Lu-177-PSMA I&T. A significantly greater tumor size reduction was shown for a single dose of F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 than for Lu-177-PSMA I&T at the end of the experiment (P = 0.0167). At the predefined termination of the experiment at 6 wk, 7 of 7 and 3 of 7 mice were still alive in the F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 and Lu-177-PSMA I&T groups, respectively, compared with the respective control groups, with 0 of 7 and 0 of 6 mice. Conclusion: Compared with Lu-177-PSMA I&T, F-19/Lu-177-rhPSMA-7.3 can be considered a suitable candidate for clinical translation because it has similar clearance kinetics and a similar radiation dose to healthy organs but superior tumor uptake and retention. Preliminary treatment experiments showed a favorable antitumor response.

Kinetic and Thermodynamic Insights into Agonist Interactions with the Parathyroid Hormone Receptor-1 from a New NanoBRET Assay	ACS CHEMICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							BINDING; PTH; ABALOPARATIDE; CONFORMATIONS; SELECTIVITY; ACTIVATION; ALLOSTERY; ANALOGS	Polypeptides that activate the parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTHR1) are important in human physiology and medicine. Most previous studies of peptide binding to this receptor have involved the displacement of a radiolabeled ligand. We report a new assay format based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Fusion of a NanoLuc luciferase (nLuc) unit to the N-terminus of the PTHR1 allows the direct detection of binding by an agonist peptide bearing a tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) unit. Affinity measurements from the BRET assay align well with results previously obtained via radioligand displacement. The BRET assay offers substantial operational benefits relative to affinity measurements involving radioactive compounds. The convenience of the new assay allowed us to explore several questions raised by earlier reports. For example, we show that although the first two residues of PTH(1-34) (the drug teriparatide) are critical for PTHR1 activation, these two residues contribute little or nothing to affinity. Comparisons among the well-studied agonists PTH(1-34), PTHrP(1-34), and "long-acting PTH" (LA-PTH) reveal that the high affinity of LA-PTH arises largely from a diminished rate constant for dissociation relative to the other two. A D-peptide recently reported to be comparable to PTH(1-34) as an agonist of the PTHR1 was found not to bind detectably to the receptor and to be a very weak agonist.

Ketamine is thought to produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effects through restoration of lost synaptic connections. We investigated this hypothesis in humans for the first time using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]UCB-J-a radioligand that binds to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) and provides an index of axon terminal density. Overall, we did not find evidence of a measurable effect on SV2A density 24 h after a single administration of ketamine in non-human primates, healthy controls (HCs), or individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), despite a robust reduction in symptoms. A post-hoc, exploratory analysis suggests that patients with lower SV2A density at baseline may exhibit increased SV2A density 24 h after ketamine. This increase in SV2A was associated with a reduction in depression severity, as well as an increase in dissociative symptoms. These initial findings suggest that a restoration of synaptic connections in patients with lower SV2A at baseline may underlie ketamine's therapeutic effects, however, this needs replication in a larger sample. Further work is needed to build on these initial findings and further establish the nuanced pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms underpinning ketamine's therapeutic effects.

Methods We determined AR copy number in pretreatment plasma samples. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) in order to evaluate the independent relevance of AR status and to evaluate patients with early progressive disease (PD) defined as treatment interruption occurring within 4 months after the start of Lu-177-PSMA-617. Results Twelve of the 15 (80%) with AR gene gain and 5 of the 25 (20%) patients with no gain of AR had early PD (p = 0.0002). The OR for patients without PSA response having AR gain was 3.69 (95% CI 0.83-16.36, p = 0.085). The OR for patients with early PD having AR gain was 16.00, (95% CI 3.23-79.27, p = 0.0007). Overall, median PFS and OS were 7.5 and 12.4 months, respectively. AR-gained had a significant shorter OS compared to AR-normal patients (7.4 vs 19.1 months, p = 0.020). No treatment interruptions due to adverse effects were reported. Discussion Plasma AR status helped to indicate mCRPC with early resistance to Lu-177-PSMA-617.

CXCR3 antagonists have been proposed to be beneficial for the treatment of a wide range of disorders including but not limited to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The structure-based design of CXCR3 ligands remains, however, hampered by a lack of structural information describing in detail the interactions between an allosteric ligand and the receptor. We designed and synthesized photoactivatable probes for the structural and functional characterization, using photoaffinity labeling followed by mass spectrometry, of the CXCR3 allosteric binding pocket of AMG 487 and RAMX3, two potent and selective CXCR3 negative allosteric modulators. Photoaffinity labeling is a common approach to elucidate binding modes of small-molecule ligands of GPCRs through the aid of photoactivatable probes that convert to extremely reactive intermediates upon photolysis. The photolabile probe N-[({1-[3-(4-ethoxyphenyl)-4-oxo-3,4-dihydropyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-2-yl]ethyl}-2-[4-fluoro-3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-N-{1-[4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]benzyl}piperidin-4-yl)methyl]acetamide (10) showed significant labeling of the CXCR3 receptor (80%) in a [H-3]RAMX3 radioligand displacement assay. Compound 10 will serve as an important tool compound for the detailed investigation of the binding pocket of CXCR3 by mass spectrometry.

Its antagonists are used clinically for treatment of postoperative- and radiotherapy-induced emesis and irritable bowel syndrome. In order to better understand the structure and function of the 5-HT3 receptor, and to allow for compound screening at this receptor, recently a serotonin binding protein (5HTBP) was engineered with the Acetylcholine Binding Protein as template. In this study, a fluorescence enhancement assay for 5HTBP ligands was developed in plate-reader format and subsequently used in an on-line microfluidic format. Both assay types were validated using an existing radioligand binding assay. The on-line microfluidic assay was coupled to HPLC via a post-column split which allowed parallel coupling to a mass spectrometer to collect MS data. This high-resolution screening (HRS) system is well suitable for compound mixture analysis. As a proof of principle, the venoms of Dendroapsis polylepis, Pseudonaja affinis and Pseudonaja inframacula snakes were screened and the accurate masses of the found bioactives were established. To demonstrate the subsequent workflow towards structural identification of bioactive proteins and peptides, the partial amino acid sequence of one of the bioactives from the Pseudonaja affinis venom was determined using a bottom-up proteomics approach.

One of the key requirements for successful central nervous system drug development is to demonstrate target coverage of therapeutic candidates in brain for lead optimization in the drug discovery phase and for assisting dose selection in clinical development. Therefore, we identified AMG 580 [1-(4-(3-(4-(1H-benzo[d]imidazole-2-carbonyl)phenoxy) pyrazin-2-yl)piperidin-1-yl)-2-fluoropropan-1-one], a novel, selective small-molecule antagonist with subnanomolar affinity for rat, primate, and human PDE10A. We showed that AMG580 is suitable as a tracer for lead optimization to determine target coverage by novel PDE10A inhibitors using triple-stage quadrupole liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry technology. [H-3]AMG 580 bound with high affinity in a specific and saturable manner to both striatal homogenates and brain slices from rats, baboons, and human in vitro. Moreover, [F-18]AMG 580 demonstrated prominent uptake by positron emission tomography in rats, suggesting that radiolabeled AMG 580 may be suitable for further development as a noninvasive radiotracer for target coverage measurements in clinical studies. These results indicate that AMG 580 is a potential imaging biomarker for mapping PDE10A distribution and ensuring target coverage by therapeutic PDE10A inhibitors in clinical studies.

However, no studies have screened for interactions between general anesthetics currently in clinical use and serotonergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Given that both intravenous and inhalational anesthetics have been shown to target other classes of GPCRs, we hypothesized that general anesthetics might interact directly with some serotonin receptors and thus modify their function. Methods: Radioligand binding assays were performed to screen serotonin receptors for interactions with propofol and isoflurane as well as for affinity determinations. Docking calculations using the crystal structure of 5-HT2B were performed to computationally confirm the binding assay results and locate anesthetic binding sites. Results: The 5-HT2B class of receptors interacted significantly with both propofol and isoflurane in the primary screen. The affinities for isoflurane and propofol were determined to be 7.78 and .95 mu M, respectively, which were at or below the clinical concentrations for both anesthetics. The estimated free energy derived from docking calculations for propofol (-6.70 kcal/mol) and isoflurane (-5.10 kcal/mol) correlated with affinities from the binding assay. The anesthetics were predicted to dock at a pharmacologically relevant binding site of 5HT(2B). Conclusions: The molecular interactions between propofol and isoflurane with the 5-HT2B class of receptors were discovered and characterized. This finding implicates the serotonergic GPCRs as potential anesthetic targets.

We have recently shown that BV-9238, a proprietary formulation of Withania somnifera, Boswellia serrata, Zingiber officinale, and Curcuma longa, inhibits LPS-induced TNF-alpha and nitric oxide production from mouse macrophage and reduces inflammation in different animal models. To evaluate the safety parameters of BV-9238, we conducted a cytotoxicity study in RAW 264.7 cells (0.005-1mg/mL) by MTT/formazan method, an acute single dose (2-10 g/kg bodyweight) toxicity study and a 180-day chronic study with 1 g and 2 g/kg bodyweight in Sprague Dawley rats. Some sedation, ptosis, and ataxia were observed for first 15-20 min in very high acute doses and hence not used for further chronic studies. At the end of 180 days, gross and histopathology, blood cell counts, liver and renal functions were all at normal levels. Further, a modest attempt was made to assess the effects of BV-9238 (0.5 mu g/mL) on six major human cytochrome P450 enzymes and H-3 radioligand binding assay with human hERG receptors. BV-9238 did not show any significant inhibition of these enzymes at the tested dose. All these suggest that BV-9238 has potential as a safe and well tolerated anti-inflammatory formulation for future use.

In this study, rat aortic adventitia showed mRNA expression and immunoreactivity of UII and its receptor (UT). Moreover, radioligand-binding assay showed that maximum binding capacity (Borax) of [(125)l]-UII was higher in adventitia than in media (28.60 +/- 1.94 vs. 20.21 +/- 1.11 fmol/mg.

UII stimulated DNA synthesis, collagen synthesis and secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. These effects were inhibited by the UII receptor antagonist urantide (10(-6) mol/l), Ca(2+) channel blocker nicardipine (10(-5) mol/l), protein kinase C inhibitor H7 (10(-6) mol/l), and mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor PD98059 (10(-6) mol/l) but not the phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase inhibitor wortmannin (10(-7) mol/l).

Changes in the structure and function of the AChR can lead to serious impairment of physiological processes. In this study, we combined site-directed mutagenesis, radioligand binding assays, electrophysiological recordings and Fourier analyses to characterize the functional role and structural aspects of the beta M4 transmembrane domain of the Torpedo AChR. We performed tryptophan replacements, from residues L438 through F455, along the beta M4 transmembrane domain. Expression levels of mutants F439W-G450W and F452W-I454W produced peak currents similar to or lower than those in wild-type (WT). Tryptophan substitutions at positions L438 and T451 led to a deficiency in either subunit expression or receptor assembly. Mutations L440W, V442W, C447W and S453W produced a gain-of-function response. Mutation F455W produced a loss of ion channel function. The periodicity profile of the normalized expression level (closed state) and EC50 (open state) revealed a minor conformational change of 0.4 residues/turn of the beta M4 domain. These findings suggest that a minor movement of the beta M4 domain occurs during channel activation.

As neuregulin I is important in cortical development we postulated that changes in neuregulin I expression may contribute towards changes in cholinergic, glutamatergic and serotonergic markers that are well documented in the CNS of subjects with that disorder. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used in situ radioligand binding to measure levels of muscarinic M1/M4 receptors, the kainate receptor, the NMDA receptor, the serotonin 2A receptor, the serotonin I A receptor and the serotonin transporter in the CNS from heterozygous transmembrane domain neuregulin I mutant mice. The major outcomes from these studies was the demonstration of an overall increase in levels of the serotonin 2A receptor (F= 11.3, d.f.=3,1,72, p=0.0012) and serotonin transporter (F=5.00, d.f. = 1,3,72, p<0.05) in the mutant mice. Levels of the other receptors did not vary in the mutant mice compared to their wild type-like litter mates. These data are the first evidence to suggest that NRGI gene expression may be involved in regulating the development of the serotonergic system in the mammalian CNS. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The present studies have characterized the in vitro properties of a radiolabeled small molecule gamma-secretase inhibitor, [H-3]compound D (Yan et al., 2004, J. Neurosci.24, 2942-2952) in mammalian brain. [H-3]Compound D was shown to bind with nanomolar affinity (K-d = 0.32-1.5 nM) to a single population of saturable sites in rat, rhesus and human brain cortex homogenates, the density of binding sites ranging from 4 to 7 nM across the species. Competition studies with a structurally diverse group of gamma-secretase inhibitors with a wide range of binding affinities showed that the binding affinities of these compounds correlated well with their ability to inhibit gamma-secretase in vitro. Autoradiographic studies showed that the specific binding of [H-3]compound D was widely distributed throughout adult rat, rhesus and normal human brain. There did not appear to be any difference in distribution of [H-3]compound D specific binding sites in AD cortex compared with control human cortex as measured using tissue section autoradiography, nor any correlation between gamma-secretase binding and plaque burden as measured immunohistochemically. [H-3]compound D is a useful tool to probe the expression and pharmacology of gamma-secretase in mammalian brain.

In rat isolated thoracic aorta, urgosedin competitively antagonized norepinephrine-, clonidine-, and serotonin-induced vasocontractions in a concentration-dependent manner. In radioligand binding experiments, urgosedin had significant binding affinities on alpha(1)/alpha(2), 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B and 5-HT2A receptors. Intravenous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced a biphasic hypotens on in normotensive rats. Although intravenous injection of urgosedin caused minor depressor actions in the normotensive Wistar rat, urgosedin significantly attenuated the secondary prolonged hypotens ion produced by LPS. The plasma levels of cytokines (IL- 1beta, IL-6, GammaNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma) and hypoglycemia induced by LPS were also reduced by urgosedin. Moreover, the acute survival rates (350 minutes) of endotoxic shock increased from 0% (LPS group) to 100% in the groups pretreated with urgosedin. In RAW264.7 cells, urgosedin inhibited LPS-induced inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. In conclusion, our data suggest that urgosedin was a newly potent serotonergic and mild alpha-adrenergic blocking agent. Its preventior of LPS-induced hypotension and hypoglycemia might partially mediate through its inhibition activities on the iNOS expression and cytokines formation. Urgosedin might be an effective pharmacological agent against LPS-induced hypotension, hypoglycemia, and the formation of pro-inflammatory mediators.

Brain uptake of [C-11]SA4503 was high after intravenous injection followed by a gradual decrease in mice, whereas that of [H-3](+)-pentazocine rapidly decreased. The brain uptake of the two radioligands was dose-dependently reduced, but the reduction of [H-3](+)-pentazocine was found at higher doses. Percentages of the saturable binding of [H-3](+)-pentazocine was much lower than that of [C-11]SA4503. The brain uptake of [H-3](+)-pentazocine was greatly blocked by SA4503 at a dose of 2 mumol/kg, while that of [C-11]SA4503 was blocked by (+)-pentazocine at a dose of 20 mumol/kg and over. When mice were treated with cyclosporin A, a P-glycoprotein modulator, the uptake of [H-3](+)-pentazoeine was enhanced, but that of [C-11]SA4503 was not. Under control and P-glycoprotein-modulated conditions, the brain uptake of both radioligands was reduced by haloperidol, another representative sigma receptor ligand, to a different extent. We concluded that the P-glycoprotein modulation resulted in the different brain kinetics of the two radioligands. The radiolabeled SA4503 is suitable as an in vivo probe, but radiolabeled (+)-pentazocine is not. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with AT(1a)R-GFP demonstrated specific, high-affinity I-125-labeled ANG II binding (IC50 21 nM). ANG II exposure stimulated sodium-proton exchange and cytoplasmic calcium release to a similar extent in cells transfected with AT(1a)R or AT(1a)R-GFP; these responses were desensitized by prior exposure to ANG II and were sensitive to the AT(1)R blocker losartan. ANG II-driven internalization of AT(1a)R-GFP in transfected CHO cells was demonstrated both by radioligand binding and by laser scanning confocal microscopy. Colocalization of GFP fluorescence with that of the nuclear stain TOTO-3 in confocal images was increased more than twofold after 1 h of ANG II exposure. We conclude that AT(1a)R-GFP exhibits similar pharmacological behavior to that of the native AT(1a)R. Our observations also support previous evidence for the presence of AT(1a)R in the nucleus and suggest that the density of AT(1a)R in the nucleus may be regulated by exposure to its ligand.

J	Krutzek, F; Donat, CK; Stadlbauer, S				Krutzek, Fabian; Donat, Cornelius K.; Stadlbauer, Sven			Exploring Hydrophilic PD-L1 Radiotracers Utilizing Phosphonic Acids: Insights into Unforeseen Pharmacokinetics	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						PD-L1; organic synthesis; structure-activity relationship; radiotracers; PET imaging; phosphonic acids	SMALL-MOLECULE INHIBITORS; MCKENNA REACTION; FMOC GROUP; PET; COMPLICATIONS; REMOVAL	Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in cancer patients, is a promising oncological treatment. However, the number of non-responders remains high, causing a burden for the patient and the healthcare system. Consequently, a diagnostic tool to predict treatment outcomes would help with patient stratification. Molecular imaging provides said diagnostic tool by offering a whole-body quantitative assessment of PD-L1 expression, hence supporting therapy decisions. Four PD-L1 radioligand candidates containing a linker-chelator system for radiometalation, along with three hydrophilizing units-one sulfonic and two phosphonic acids-were synthesized. After labeling with 64Cu, log D7.4 values of less than -3.03 were determined and proteolytic stability confirmed over 94% intact compound after 48 h. Binding affinity was determined using two different assays, revealing high affinities up to 13 nM. mu PET/CT imaging was performed in tumor-bearing mice to investigate PD-L1-specific tumor uptake and the pharmacokinetic profile of radioligands. These results yielded an unexpected in vivo distribution, such as low tumor uptake in PD-L1 positive tumors, high liver uptake, and accumulation in bone/bone marrow and potentially synovial spaces. These effects are likely caused by Ca2+-affinity and/or binding to macrophages. Despite phosphonic acids providing high water solubility, their incorporation must be carefully considered to avoid compromising the pharmacokinetic behavior of radioligands.

Patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) whose disease has progressed on standard-of-care therapies have few options and a poor prognosis. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II integral membrane protein that is commonly expressed in prostate cancer. Expression is limited on extra-prostatic tissues other than the salivary glands, lacrimal glands, duodenal epithelium, Kupffer cells, and renal tubules. PSMA-directed theranostics has emerged to exploit the specificity of PSMA for prostate cancer cells and has demonstrated promising results in the clinic. Radionuclides linked to PSMA inhibitors/binders have resulted in US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of 2 radiodiagnostics for PSMA-directed positron emission tomography/computed tomography. In addition, these radionuclides have led to the development of lutetium Lu 177PSMA-617 therapy, which is currently under priority FDA review. Multiple novel PSMA-targeted modalities have been developed and are currently under clinical investigation, including ligand-drug and cellular immune therapies. In this review, we discuss the development of PSMA-directed theranostics, along with its clinical implications, limitations, and future directions.

A local-neighborhood Lassen plot filter for creating occupancy and non-displaceable binding images	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Lassen plot; Lassen plot filter; non-displaceable binding; occupancy; positron emission tomography	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO; PET; PHARMACOLOGY; C-11; D-2	For radioligands without a reference region, the Lassen plot can be used to estimate receptor occupancy by an exogenous drug ( ODrug). However, the Lassen plot is not well-suited for spatial variation in ODrug. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Lassen plot filter, i.e. a Lassen plot applied to local neighborhoods in PET images. Image data were simulated with regional variation in VND, ODrug, both, or neither and analyzed using the change in binding potential ( Delta BPND), the conventional Lassen plot, and the Lassen plot filter at the region of interest (ROI) and voxel level. All methods were also applied to a human [C-11]flumazenil occupancy study using PF-06372865. This combination of a non-selective radioligand and selective drug should lead to varying ODrug provided the distribution of subtypes varies spatially. In contrast with Delta BPND and the conventional Lassen plot, ROI-level and voxel-level Lassen plot filter estimates remained unbiased in the presence of regional variation in VND or ODrug. In the [C-11]flumazenil data-set, ODrug was shown to vary regionally in accordance with the distribution of binding sites for [C-11]flumazenil and PF-06372865. We demonstrate that a local-neighborhood Lassen plot filter provides robust and unbiased estimates of ODrug and VND without the need for any user intervention.

F-18-PBR06 was synthesized with an average decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 30-40% (end of synthesis, EOS), and the radiochemical purity was greater than 99%. The inflammation-to-blood ratio of F-18-PBR06 (3.53 +/- 0.26) was higher than the tumor-to-blood ratio (1.77 +/- 0.35) (P<0.001). The inflammation-to-muscle ratio of F-18-PBR06 (2.33 +/- 0.64) was also higher than the tumor-to-muscle ratio (1.45 +/- 0.14) (P=0.036). Micro-PET/CT images showed high uptake of F-18-FDG in both inflamed muscles and lung tumor tissues. However, F-18-PBR06 uptake in inflamed muscles remained higher than that in the lung tumor tissues, following 90min of dynamic Micro-PET/CT imaging. Further, macrophages in the inflammatory regions showed a higher fluorescence signal than in lung tumor tissues. Results of the study confirmed that F-18-PBR06 PET/CT imaging allowed for diagnosis of inflammation. Moreover, F-18-PBR06 uptake in the inflammatory regions was significantly higher than in lung tumor tissues, suggesting that F-18-PBR06 PET/CT imaging has potential to differentiate between peripheral lung cancer and inflammation nodules.

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether Ga-68-PSMA-PET has incremental value over conventional imaging for selecting patients suitable for Ra-223]-dichloride therapy. Methods: In 27 consecutive patients referred for Ra-223-dichloride therapy additional Ga-68-PSMA-PET/CT was performed and tracer distribution was evaluated systematically with respect to the detection of visceral metastases and bone metastases with inadequate uptake on bone scintigraphy. Results: In 4 patients (15 %) Ga-68-PSMA-PET revealed previously unknown visceral metastases (3 liver, 1 adrenal gland), which changed the therapeutic decision in 2 cases. PET revealed more extended tumour involvement in the bone compared to bone scintigraphy in 9 patients (33 %). In 3 of these, the mismatch was extensive enough to question suitability for Ra-223-dichloride therapy. Conclusions: Additional Ga-68-PSMA-PET as a gatekeeper between conventional staging and Ra-223-dichloride therapy can provide valuable additional information with regard to visceral metastases and tumour manifestations without adequate bone mineral turnover. It may lead to a change in therapeutic management in a significant number of patients and should therefore be considered in future clinical trials.

Targeting Metal-Aβ Aggregates with Bifunctional Radioligand [<SUP>11</SUP>C]L2-b and a Fluorine-18 Analogue [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FL2-b	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-beta; metal ions; metal-A beta; positron emission tomography; carbon-11; fluorine-18	HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE PRODUCTION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BINDING; PEPTIDE; MECHANISM; COPPER	Interest in quantifying metal-A beta species in vivo led to the synthesis and evaluation of [C-11]L2-b and [F-18]FL2-b as radiopharmaceuticals for studying the metallobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. [C-11]L2-b was synthesized in 3.6% radiochemical yield (nondecay corrected, n = 3), >95% radiochemical purity, from the corresponding desmethyl precursor. [F-18]FL2-b was synthesized in 1.0% radiochemical yield (nondecay corrected, n = 3), >99% radiochemical purity, from a 6-chloro pyridine precursor. Autoradiography experiments with AD positive and healthy control brain samples were used to determine the specificity of binding for the radioligands compared to [C-11]PiB, a known imaging agent for beta-amyloid (A beta) aggregates. The K-d for [C-11]L2-b and [F-18]PL2-b were found to be 3.5 and 9.4 nM, respectively, from those tissue studies. Displacement studies of [C-11]L2-b and [F-18]FL2-b with PiB and AV-45 determined that L2-b binds to A beta aggregates differently from known radiopharmaceuticals. Finally, brain uptake of [C-11]L2-b was examined through microPET imaging in healthy rhesus macaque, which revealed a maximum uptake at 2.5 min (peak SUV = 2.0) followed by rapid egress (n = 2).

Functional up-regulation of endopeptidase neurolysin during post-acute and early recovery phases of expermental stroke in mouse brain	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						endogenous brain-repair mechanism; ischemic stroke; mitochondria; neuropeptide; peptidase; response to stroke	MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; RAT; NEUROTENSIN; ANGIOTENSIN; MECHANISMS; PURIFICATION; INHIBITION; OCCLUSION; PEPTIDE	In this study, we provide evidence for the first time that membrane-bound endopeptidase neurolysin is up-regulated in different parts of mouse brain affected by focal ischemia-reperfusion in a middle cerebral artery occlusion model of stroke. Radioligand binding, enzymatic and immunoblotting experiments in membrane preparations of frontoparietal cortex, striatum, and hippocampus isolated from the ischemic hemisphere of mouse brain 24 h after reperfusion revealed statistically significant increase (>= twofold) in quantity and activity of neurolysin compared with sham-operated controls. Cerebellar membranes isolated from the ischemic hemisphere served as negative control supporting the observations that up-regulation of neurolysin occurs in post-ischemic brain regions. This study also documents sustained functional up-regulation of neurolysin in frontoparietal cortical membranes for at least 7 days after stroke, which appears not to be transcriptionally or translationally regulated, but rather depends on translocation of cytosolic neurolysin to the membranes and mitochondria. Considering diversity of endogenous neurolysin substrates (neurotensin, bradykinin, angiotensins I/II, substance P, hemopressin, dynorphin A(1-8), metorphamide, somatostatin) and the well-documented role of these peptidergic systems in pathogenesis of stroke, resistance to ischemic injury and/or post-stroke brain recovery, our findings suggest that neurolysin may play a role in processes modulating the brain's response to stroke and its recovery after stroke.

In this study, a new neurotensin analogue was labeled with Tc-99m via HYNIC and tricine/EDDA as coligands and investigated further. [HYNIC0, Gly(7), Lys(9), d-Tyr(11)]-Neurotensin (7-13) was synthesized using a standard Fmoc strategy. Labeling with Tc-99m was performed at 100 A degrees C for 10 min and radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and HPLC methods. The stability of radiopeptide was checked in the presence of humane serum at 37 A degrees C up to 24 h. The receptor bound internalization and externalization rates were studied in neurotensin receptor expressing HT-29 cells. Biodistribution of radiopeptide was studied in nude mice bearing HT-29 tumor. Labeling yield of 98.6 +/- A 0.54 % (n = 3) was obtained corresponding to a specific activity of 81 MBq/nmol. Peptide conjugate showed good stability in the presence of human serum. The radioligand showed specific internalization into HT-29 cells (12.43 +/- A 0.52 % at 4 h). In biodistribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake was observed in neurotensin receptor positive organs so that after 1 h the uptakes in mouse intestine and tumor were 0.87 +/- A 0.16 and 0.63 +/- A 0.12 % ID/g respectively.

By radioligand binding experiments in the absence or in the presence of the A(1)Rs allosteric modulator, adenosine deaminase, and by using the two-state dimer receptor model to fit binding data, we demonstrated that the protomer-protomer interactions in the A(1)R homomers account for some of the pharmacological characteristics of agonist and antagonist binding to A(1)Rs. These pharmacological properties include the appearance of cooperativity in agonist binding, the change from a biphasic saturation curve to a monophasic curve in self-competition experiments and the molecular cross-talk detected when two different specific molecules bind to the receptor. In this last case, we discovered that caffeine binding to one protomer increases the agonist affinity for the other protomer in the AIR homomer, a pharmacological characteristic that correlates with the low caffeine concentrations-induced activation of agonist-promoted A(1)R signaling. This pharmacological property can explain the biphasic effects reported at low and high concentration of caffeine on locomotor activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The X-ray crystal structure of agonist-bound alpha(7) acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP) has been recognized as the most appropriate template to model the ligand-binding domain of nAChR for studying the molecular mechanism of the receptor-ligand interactions. Virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute diversity set, a library of 1990 compounds with nonredundant pharmacophore profiles, using AutoDock against AChBPs revealed 51 potential candidates. In vitro radioligand competition assays using [H-3] epibatidine against the AChBPs from the freshwater snails, Lymnaea stagnalis, and from the marine species, Aplysia californica and the mutant (AcY55W), revealed seven compounds from the list of candidates that had micromolar to nanomolar affinities for the AChBPs. Further investigation on alpha(7)nAChR expressing in Xenopus oocytes and on the recombinant receptors with fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based calcium sensor expressing in HEK cells showed that seven compounds were antagonists of alpha(7)nAChR, only one compound (NSC34352) demonstrated partial agonistic effect at low dose (10 mu M), and two compounds (NSC36369 and NSC34352) were selective antagonists on alpha(7)nAchR with moderate potency. These hits serve as novel templates/scaffolds for development of more potent and specific in the AChR systems.

PBMC were isolated from human blood buffy coats provided by the blood transfusion service and were used for radioligand binding studies with [H-3]-nicotine. RT-PCR experiments were used to determine nAChR subunit expression while immunoblotting experiments were used to confirm that nAChR subunits identified by RT-PCR were translated into protein. Binding studies suggested the presence of one binding site for (-)- nicotine on human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Competition studies showed that only (-)- nicotine, epibatidine and alpha-bungarotoxin, displaced radiolabelled nicotine from cells. RT-PCR studies demonstrated mRNA for alpha 4, alpha 5, alpha 7, beta 1 and beta 2 nAChRs subunits in PBMC. Expression of mRNA for the a5 subunit of nAChR was observed in all lymphocyte samples tested. In contrast, the expression pattern of mRNAs for alpha 4, alpha 7, beta 1, and beta 2 mRNAs subunits of nAChRs, varied between samples. Western blot analysis showed that protein for alpha 4, alpha 5, and alpha 7 and beta 2 nAChR subunits was expressed in most, but not all of the PBMC samples tested but some of the bands obtained were faint. The results obtained suggest that human PBMC contain nAChRs containing alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 4 beta 2 alpha 5, and/or alpha 7 subunits.	[Wongsriraksa, A.; Parsons, M. E.; Whelan, C.

We have isolated and characterized one of these beta-sheet containing proteins with a mass of 7012.43 +/- 0.91 Da from the venom. The protein was nonlethal up to a dose of 10 mg/kg when injected intraperitoneally into Swiss albino mice. However, it induces labored breathing and death at a dose of 100 mg/kg. It does not show any hemolytic or anticoagulant activity. It caused a dose-dependent decrease of heart rate in vivo (anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats) and also ex vivo (Langendorff isolated rat heart). This is in contrast to classical cardiotoxins from snake venom that increase the heart rate in animals. Radioligand displacement studies showed that this protein targets beta-adrenergic receptors with a binding affinity (K-i) of 5.3 and 2.3 mu M toward beta(1) and beta(2) subtypes, respectively, to bring about its effect, and hence, it was named as beta-cardiotoxin. This is the first report of a natural exogenous beta-blocker.

UBP296 was found to be a potent and selective antagonist of native GLU(K5)-containing kainate receptors in the spinal cord, with activity residing in the S enantiomer (UBP302). In cells expressing human kainate receptor subunits, UBP296 selectively depressed glutamate-induced calcium influx in cells containing GLU(K5) in homomeric or heteromeric forms. In radioligand displacement binding studies, the willardiine analogues displaced [H-3]kainate binding with IC50 values > 100 muM at rat GLU(K6), GLU(K2) or GLU(K6)/GLU(K2). An explanation of the GLU(K5) selectivity of UBP296 was obtained using homology models of the antagonist bound forms of GLU(K5) and GLU(K6). In rat hippocampal slices, UBP296 reversibly blocked ATPA-induced depressions of synaptic transmission at concentrations Subthreshold for affecting AMPA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission directly. UBP296 also completely blocked the induction of mossy fibre LTP, in medium containing 2 mM (but not 4 mM) Ca2+. These data provide further evidence for a role for GLU(K5)-containing kainate receptors in mossy fibre LTP. In conclusion, UBP296 is the most potent and selective antagonist of GLU(K5)-containing kainate receptors so far described. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Kommalage, M; Höglund, AU				Kommalage, M; Höglund, AU			(±)Epibatidine increases acetylcholine release partly through an action on muscarinic receptors	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							EPIBATIDINE BINDING-SITES; RAT SPINAL-CORD; INTRASPINAL RELEASE; NICOTINIC AGONIST; IN-VITRO; ANTINOCICEPTIVE RESPONSES; GANGLION NEURONS; NITRIC-OXIDE; ANALGESIA; SUBTYPES	Epibatidine has been used in a wide dose range and was found to produce both nociceptive and antinociceptive effects. The different effects were partly explained by an action on multiple nicotinic receptor systems. The present study investigated the possibility that part of the action of intraspinally or subcutaneously administered (+/-) epibatidine, is mediated through an action on muscarinic receptors. Radioligand receptor assays were performed using homogenates of rat spinal cord and muscarinic M1-M5 receptors expressed in Sf9 cells. The intraspinal acetylcholine releasing effect of intraspinally and subcutaneously administered (+/-) epibatidine was studied with and without with atropine pretreatment. (+/-) Epibatidine has affinity for muscarinic receptors both in spinal cord tissue and expressed in Sf9 cells. The intraspinal administration of 160 muM (+/-) epibatidine produced an increase in acetylcholine release that was reduced by pretreatment with 100 muM atropine. Subcutaneous administration of 30 mug/kg (+/-) epibatidine produced an increase in intraspinal acetylcholine release that was not inhibited by 5 mg/kg subcutaneous atropine pretreatment. We conclude that (+/-) epibatidine, in muM concentrations, is a partial muscarinic receptor agonist that may interact with spinal muscarinic receptors to increase acetylcholine release. Epibatidine induced spinal acetylcholine release observed after subcutaneous administration appears not to be mediated via muscarinic receptor. The dual action on both nicotinic receptors and muscarinic receptors may explain the potent analgesic effect observed after epibatidine administration.

The enantiomeric ratios for several beta-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists at the cloned mouse, rat and human beta(3)-adrenoceptor were less than those reported at the cloned beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor but higher than those reported in previous studies. The degree of stereoselectivity was relatively low for the agonists isoprenaline and noradrenaline but higher for antagonists and, in particular, tertatolol and propranolol. In mouse ileum, stereoselectivity of propranolol and tertatolol was observed under beta(1)-/beta(2)-adrenoceptor blockade. The (-)-enantiomers of propranolol and tertatolol were more effective at antagonism of ( -)-isoprenaline-mediated relaxation of mouse ileum than their (+)-enantiomers. The recombinant mouse, rat and human beta(3)-adrenoceptors display stereoselective interactions for agonists and antagonists similar to the stereoselective profile Of beta(3)-adrenoceptors in mouse ileum. The degree of stereoselectivity varied between species and the human beta(3)-adrenoceptor displayed higher affinities and enantiomeric ratios than the mouse or rat beta(3)-adrenoceptors.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of antihypertensive treatment with doxazosin or propranolol on the binding and functional parameters of A(2A) adenosine receptors of lymphocytes and neutrophils in essential hypertensive patients. Two groups of previously untreated, essential hypertensive patients were studied. The mean affinity (K-d) and density (B-max) of adenosine receptors, by the A(2A) selective radioligand [H-3]-ZM-241385 binding assays, and EC50, by cAMP assays, were obtained first on no medication and a second time after treatment for up to 13 weeks with doxazosin (13 patients) or propranolol (8 patients). A third group of 15 healthy normotensive volunteers matched by age, sex, and body mass index was used as a control. Binding and functional parameters of the A(2A) adenosine receptors were significantly higher in the 2 hypertensive groups than in controls (P always <0.0001), both in lymphocyte and neutrophil membranes. After treatment with propranolol, the binding parameters did not change significantly, whereas after treatment with doxazosin, K-d, B-max, and EC50 values returned to control levels. In never-treated essential hypertensive patients, lower affinity, higher density, and impaired function of A(2A) adenosine receptors are present. The binding and functional parameters of A(2A) adenosine receptors appear to be normalized after treatment with doxazosin but not with propranolol.

Development and Characterization of Novel Selective, Non-Basic Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> Receptor Antagonists for the Treatment of Schizophrenia	MOLECULES			English	Article						antipsychotic; dopamine D-2 receptor; schizophrenia; SAR studies; GPCRs; lead optimization	DISCOVERY; PROTEIN; CONFORMATION; EFFICACY; INSIGHTS; TARGETS; DESIGN; MODELS; AGENTS	The dopamine D-2 receptor, which belongs to the family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR), is an important and well-validated drug target in the field of medicinal chemistry due to its wide distribution, particularly in the central nervous system, and involvement in the pathomechanism of many disorders thereof. Schizophrenia is one of the most frequent diseases associated with disorders in dopaminergic neurotransmission, and in which the D-2 receptor is the main target for the drugs used. In this work, we aimed at discovering new selective D-2 receptor antagonists with potential antipsychotic activity. Twenty-three compounds were synthesized, based on the scaffold represented by the D2AAK2 compound, which was discovered by our group. This compound is an interesting example of a D-2 receptor ligand because of its non-classical binding to this target. Radioligand binding assays and SAR analysis indicated structural modifications of D2AAK2 that are possible to maintain its activity. These findings were further rationalized using molecular modeling. Three active derivatives were identified as D-2 receptor antagonists in cAMP signaling assays, and the selected most active compound 17 was subjected to X-ray studies to investigate its stable conformation in the solid state. Finally, effects of 17 assessed in animal models confirmed its antipsychotic activity in vivo.

To provide detailed maps of the brain localization of SV2A autoradiography studies were carried out using the SV2A radioligand [C-11]UCB-J and whole hemisphere sections of non-human primate (NHP) and human brain. Binding of [C-11]UCB-J was observed in all evaluated grey matter structures of the primate brain, with highest density in the caudate nucleus and cortex and lowest density in pons and globus pallidus. The density of [C-11]UCB-J binding sites in human brain showed a good correlation with that in NHP brain. Binding of [C-11]UCB-J in the white matter was very low relative to that in grey matter containing structures and was only inhibited to a minor extent by co-incubation with a saturating concentration of unlabelled UCB-J. The high-resolution images obtained in the present study may aid the interpretation of data acquired in human subjects examined using [C-11]UCB-J in PET studies. In addition, observation of low binding for [C-11]UCB-J in white matter (centrum semiovale) supports that this structure can be used as a reference region for quantitative analysis of [C-11]UCB-J PET data.

Radiation dosimetry of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-PSS232a PET radioligand for imaging mGlu5 receptors in humans	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Dosimetry; Tracer; [F-18]-PSS232; mGlu5 receptors	IN-VIVO EVALUATION; TRACER; VITRO; BIODISTRIBUTION; F-18-FPEB; BRAIN	Purpose(E)-3-(pyridin-2-ylethynyl)cyclohex-2-enone O-(3-(2-[F-18]-fluoroethoxy)propyl) oxime ([F-18]-PSS232) is a new PET tracer for imaging of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5), and has shown promising results in rodents and humans. The aim of this study was to estimate the radiation dosimetry and biodistribution in humans, to assess dose-limiting organs, and to demonstrate safety and tolerability of [F-18]-PSS232 in healthy volunteers.MethodsPET/CT scans of six healthy male volunteers (mean age 23.51.7; 21-26years) were obtained after intravenous administration of 2433MBq of [F-18]-PSS232. Serial whole-body (vertex to mid-thigh) PET scans were assessed at ten time points, up to 90min after tracer injection. Calculation of tracer kinetics and cumulated organ activities were performed using PMOD 3.7 software. Dosimetry estimates were calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software.Results Injection of [F-18]-PSS232 was safe and well tolerated. Organs with highest absorbed doses were the gallbladder wall (0.2295mGy/MBq), liver (0.0547mGy/MBq), and the small intestine (0.0643mGy/MBq). Mean effective dose was 3.72 +/- 0.12mSv/volunteer (range 3.61-3.96mSv; 0.0153mSv/MBq).Conclusion [F-18]-PSS232, a novel [F-18]-labeled mGlu5 tracer, showed favorable dosimetry values. Additionally, the tracer was safe and well tolerated.

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to image dopamine D-2 receptors (D2R) and transporters (DAT) in women with RTT and in Mecp2-deficient mice, and D1R and D2R density was measured in postmortem human tissue by autoradiography. Results showed 1) significantly reduced D2R density in the striatum of women with RTT compared to control subjects. 2) PET imaging of mouse striatum similarly demonstrated significant reductions in D2R density of 7-10 week-old hemizygous (Mecp2-null) and heterozygous (HET) mice compared to wild type (WT) mice. With age, the density of D2R declined in WT mice but not HET mice. 3) In contrast, postmortem autoradiography revealed no group differences in the density of D1R and D2R in the caudate and putamen of RTT versus normal control subjects. 4) In humans and in the mouse model, PET revealed only marginal group differences in DAT. The results confirm that dopaminergic dysfunction in WIT is also present in Mecp2-deficient mice and that reductions in D2R more likely explain the impaired ambulation and progressive rigidity observed rather than alterations in DAT.

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent a main class of membrane proteins and drug targets, which are responsible for a huge number of signaling processes regulating various physiological functions in living cells. To circumvent the current bottlenecks in GPCR studies, we propose the synthesis of GPCRs in eukaryotic cell-free systems based on extracts generated from insect (Sf21) cells. Insect cell lysates harbor the fully active translational and translocational machinery allowing posttranslational modifications, such as glycosylation and phosphorylation of de novo synthesized proteins. Here, we demonstrate the production of several GPCRs in a eukaryotic cell-free system, performed within a short time and in a cost-effective manner. We were able to synthesize a variety of GPCRs ranging from 40 to 133kDa in an insect-based cell-free system. Moreover, we have chosen the opioid receptor (MOR) as a model protein to analyze the ligand binding affinities of cell-free synthesized MOR in comparison to MOR expressed in a human cell line by one-point radioligand binding experiments.

Identification of Histamine H<sub>3</sub> Receptor Ligands Using a New Crystal Structure Fragment-based Method	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; PRIVILEGED STRUCTURES; DRUG DISCOVERY; BINDING SITE; H3 RECEPTOR; CHEMOGENOMICS; DATABASE; CLONING; DESIGN	Virtual screening offers an efficient alternative to high-throughput screening in the identification of pharmacological tools and lead compounds. Virtual screening is typically based on the matching of target structures or ligand pharmacophores to commercial or in-house compound catalogues. This study provides the first proof-of-concept for our recently reported method where pharmacophores are instead constructed based on the inference of residue-ligand fragments from crystal structures. We demonstrate its unique utility for G protein-coupled receptors, which represent the largest families of human membrane proteins and drug targets. We identified five neutral antagonists and one inverse agonist for the histamine H-3 receptor with potencies of 0.7-8.5 mu M in a recombinant receptor cell-based inositol phosphate accumulation assay and validated their activity using a radioligand competition binding assay. H-3 receptor antagonism is of large therapeutic value and our ligands could serve as starting points for further lead optimisation. The six ligands exhibit four chemical scaffolds, whereof three have high novelty in comparison to the known H3 receptor ligands in the ChEMBL database. The complete pharmacophore fragment library is freely available through the GPCR database, GPCRdb, allowing the successful application herein to be repeated for most of the 285 class A GPCR targets. The method could also easily be adapted to other protein families.

One challenging problem in using MIPs for sensor development is the lack of reliable conjugation chemistry that allows MIPs to be fixed on transducer surface. In this work, we study the use of epoxy silane to immobilize MIP nanoparticles on model transducer surfaces without impairing the function of the immobilized nanoparticles. The MIP nanoparticles with a core shell structure have selective molecular binding sites in the core and multiple amino groups in the shell. The model transducer surface is functionalized with a self-assembled monolayer of epoxy silane, which reacts with the core shell MIP particles to enable straightforward immobilization. The whole process is characterized by studying the treated surfaces after each preparation step using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence microscopy, contact angle measurements and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The microscopy results show that the MIP particles are immobilized uniformly on surface. The photoelectron spectroscopy results further confirm the action of each functionalization step. The molecular selectivity of the MIP-fiinctionalized surface is verified by radioligand binding analysis. The particle immobilization approach described here has a general applicability for constructing selective chemical sensors in different formats. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

ORL1 antagonists have potential for clinical use as analgesic and antineuropathic drugs, and thus information on the receptor-binding characteristics of antagonists is very important for rational drug design. In the present study, we prepared tritiumlabelled isova-RYYRIK-NH2 from its precursor with the 3-methylcrotonyl (CH3)(2)C=CHCO group by a catalytic reduction using tritium gas. The resulting [H-3] isoVa-RYYRIK-NH2 was evaluated in a saturation binding assay using the COS-7 cell membrane preparations of transiently expressed ORL1. It exhibited more than 90% specific binding with a dissociation constant of 1.21 +/- 0.03 nM. From the mutual heterologous binding assays using [H-3] isoVa-RYYRIK-NH2 and [H-3] nociceptin, isoVa-RYYRIK-NH2 and nociceptin were found to share the receptor-binding site, but each also had a separate specific binding site of its own. They differentiated the two different binding states or conformations of ORL1, which might represent the agonist-active and antagonist-inactive conformations of ORL1. [H-3] isoVa-RYYRIK-NH2 is thus a key tracer to uncover the amino acid residues important for receptor inactivation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several lines of evidence point towards a strong lateralization of these mental processes, which indicates similar asymmetries in associated neurotransmitter systems. Here, our aim was to investigate a potential asymmetry of the serotonin transporter distribution using positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]DASB in vivo. As brain asymmetries may differ between sexes, we further aimed to compare serotonin transporter asymmetry between females, males and male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals whose brains are considered to be partly feminized. Voxel-wise analysis of serotonin transporter binding in all groups showed both strong left and rightward asymmetries in several cortical and subcortical structures including temporal and frontal cortices, anterior cingulate, hippocampus, caudate and thalamus. Further, male controls showed a rightward asymmetry in the midcingulate cortex, which was absent in females and MtF transsexuals. The present data support the notion of a lateralized serotonergic system, which is in line with previous findings of asymmetric serotonin-1A receptor distributions, extracellular serotonin concentrations, serotonin turnover and uptake. The absence of serotonin transporter asymmetry in the midcingulate in MtF transsexuals may be attributed to an absence of brain masculinization in this region.

An experimental model of toxoplasmosis was developed. The presence of toxoplasmosis was confirmed 60 days after implantation. Pyrimethamine was radioiodinated with I-131. The radioligand was validated by the requisite quality control tests to check its radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro stability and radiochemical purity etc. I-131-Pyrimethamine (specific activity: 7.08 MBq/mu mol) was injected intravenously into the tail vein of the control and infected rats. Static whole body images of the rats were acquired under the gamma camera at 5 min, 45 min, 2 h, 6 h, and 24 h following the intravenous administration of the radioactivity (3.7 MBq/rat). Then the scintigraphic data were analyzed both visually and semiquantitatively. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over the organs (thyroid, stomach, liver, bladder, and soft tissues) to calculate the ratios of the radiotracer in infected vs. control rats. The mean ratio of radiotracer in infected/control rats in the liver and diaphragm was over 1 at 45 min which persisted till 24 h. In conclusion, I-131-Pyrimethamine may be useful agent for diagnosis toxoplasmosis especially involving liver and diaphragm, needs further preclinical validation before being extended for use in clinical applications.

In the present study, the role of the endogenous opioid peptide beta-endorphin in DHA-induced antinociception was examined. DHA-induced antinociception was abolished when mice were pretreated with the mu-opioid receptor antagonist beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA) and the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole, but not by the kappa-opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) in the acetic acid-induced writhing test. In the radioligand binding assay, DHA itself did not have affinity for mu-, delta- or kappa-opioid receptors. On the other hand, the pretreatment of anti-beta-endorphin antiserum inhibited DHA-induced antinociception. Furthermore, the intracerebroventricular injection of DHA dose-dependently reduced writhing behavior, and this effect was inhibited by D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2 (CTOP) and naltrindole, but not nor-BNI. beta-endorphin-induced antinociception was inhibited by the pretreatment of beta-FNA, but not naltrindole or nor-BNI, and its levels in plasma were increased by DHA treatment. These findings suggest that the induction of antinociception by DHA may partially involve the mu-opioid receptor via the release of beta-endorphin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This effect is partially reversed by the application of caffeine, which is a nonselective blocker of adenosine receptors. Here, we report that the most abundant and highly concentrated A(1) subtype of cerebral adenosine receptors is upregulated after 24 h of sleep deprivation. We used the highly selective A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) radioligand [F-18] CPFPX ([F-18]8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine) and quantitative positron emission tomography to assess cerebral A(1)ARs before and after sleep deprivation in 12 healthy volunteers and a control group (n = 10) with regular sleep. In sleep deprived subjects, we found an increase of the apparent equilibrium total distribution volume in a region-specific pattern in all examined brain regions with a maximum increase in the orbitofrontal cortex (15.3%; p = 0.014). There were no changes in the control group with regular sleep. This is the first molecular imaging study that provides in vivo evidence for an A(1)AR upregulation in cortical and subcortical brain regions after prolonged wakefulness, indicating that A(1)AR expression is contributing to the homeostatic sleep regulation.

The novel ligands have been pharmacologically investigated in vitro for their affinities on the human H3R and H4R subtypes by radioligand displacement experiments and for their intrinsic H3R activities via a CRE-mediated P-galactosidase reporter gene assay. Subtle changes of the substitution pattern at the side chain nitrogen alter enormously the pharmacological activity of the ligands, resulting in a series of compounds with a wide spectrum of pharmacological activities. Among the several neutral H3R antagonists identified within this series, compounds 2b and 2h display an H3R affinity in the low nanomolar concentration range (pK(i) values of 8.1 and 8.4, respectively). A very potent and selective H3R agonist (1l, pEC(50) 8.9, alpha = 0.94) and a very potent, though not highly selective, H3R inverse agonist (2k, pIC(50) = 8-9, alpha -0.97) have been identified as well.

J	Pintér, O; Pajor, L; Molnár, J; Márki, A; Falkay, G				Pintér, O; Pajor, L; Molnár, J; Márki, A; Falkay, G			The role of androgen receptors in the dynamic process of prostate cancer:: Their analytical determination in biopsy material	IN VIVO			English	Article						androgen receptors; prostate-specific antigen; radioligand receptor analysis	GLEASON SCORE; P53 MUTATIONS; KAPPA-B; CARCINOMA; CELLS; BCL-2; ASSOCIATION; COMBINATION; WITHDRAWAL; APOPTOSIS	Under normal conditions, androgen receptors function via ligand binding and other coactivators in prostate cancer cells. The effects of the currently applied therapy are achieved through inhibition of the formation of the testosterone-receptor complex. With the advance of research at a cellular level, it is now known that tumorigenesis is much more complicated, and that tumour cell growth regulated by androgens is a complex process. The aim of our work was to utilize literature data in a search for a correlation between the number of androgen receptors and the clinical course of the disease. Transperineal ultrasound-guided biopsies were performed on 82 (otherwise unselected) patients with suspected prostate cancer, and the numbers of androgen receptors in the tissue samples were determined by a receptor-analytical method. Prostate cancer was confirmed in 43 cases. Rebiopsy was scheduled for 1 year later. We were able to carry out repeated biopsies in 18 cases, and to determine the number of receptors by the earlier method. The patients were followed clinically, and the efficacy of their medication was measured via improvement in their general condition and study of the prostate-specific antigen level. The investigation demonstrated that determination of the number of receptors itself is not of prognostic value, but it does provide information to Supplement the other parameters relating to the state.

In vitro competition binding studies were conducted with the new molecules and H-3-spiperone on crude membrane preparation from rat striatum and frontal cortex. One of these compounds. 3-benzylamino-1-(4-fluoro-2-iodophenyl)-propan-1-ol (6f), whose IC50 values are in the micromolar range for both the D-2 and 5-HT2 receptors. was prepared in iodine-125 labelled form (6i) by nucleophilic substitution of the bromine atom of 3-benzylamino-1-(2-bromo-4-fluorophenvl)-propan-1-ol (6d). In the in vivo studies. conducted on rats, the radiolabelled molecule 6i shows a good capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with a mean value of first pas., cerebral extraction (E) of ca. 50% when the regional cerebral blood flow. measured with microsphere technique, is in the experimental animal's physiologic range (0.8-1 mL/min/g). A preliminary in vitro autoradiographic distribution on coronal rat brain slices of the radioiodinated molecule showed that it was preferentially localized in the striatum and in the cerebral regions rich in dopamine- and serotonin receptors, even if a high nonspecific binding was observed.

The high affinity radioligand [C-11]FLB 457 makes possible the measurement of low concentrations of D-2 receptors in extrastriatal regions using positron emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to assess the test/retest variability and reliability of [C-11]FLB 457 binding using a reference tissue model. Eight healthy male subjects (aged 20-33 years) underwent two [C-11]FLB 457 PET examinations. Radioactivity in the cerebellum was used as the reference. The binding potentials (BPs) for five cortical regions of interest (ROIs) were calculated using the reference tissue model. The BP was also calculated for each pixel in the form of parametric images. Reproducibility was assessed both for the ROI method and for the parametric images. The test/retest reproducibility for [C-11]FLB 457 binding was good, with a mean variability ranging from 4.5% for the thalamus to 15.5% for the hippocampus. The parametric images also demonstrated good reproducibility. These results support the suitability of using [C-11]FLB 457 for the quantitative evaluation of extrastriatal D-2 receptors and for protocols requiring repeated measurements in the same individual.

Surprisingly, this peripallidal binding persists in monkeys rendered parkinsonian (n = 5) with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment. The border cell electrophysiological activity was then analysed in normal and parkinsonian monkeys (n = 2), either in the untreated state or following administration of levodopa. Pallidal border cell firing frequency was significantly decreased after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment (8.9 +/- 0.7 vs 31.4 +/- 1.6 Hz, P < 0.05). This decrease was partly corrected by levodopa administration (19.2 +/- 1.0 Hz, P < 0.05 vs both normal and parkinsonian situations). The peripallidal dopaminergic innervation suggests that pallidal border cells are under a direct dopaminergic control, arising from the ventral tegmental area and/or the basal forebrain magnocellular complex, the role of which remains unknown. Moreover, the relative sparing of these dopaminergic fibers in parkinsonian monkeys suggests that they would exhibit specific adaptive properties totally different from those described in the nigrostriatal pathway.

Phenyloxiranes 6 and (indazolyl)oxirane 15 were opened regioselectively at the position bearing the aryl moiety. Reaction of the resulting beta-aminoalcohols 7 and 16 with carboxylic acids under Mitsunobu conditions (DIAD, PPh3) led to rearrangement and after ester hydrolysis to the regioisomeric beta-aminoalcohols 9 and 18. This strategy allows the synthesis of amino-ifenprodil 12 as well using phthalimide in the Mitsunobu reaction. Unexpectedly, the isomeric (indazolyl)oxirane 21 reacted with benzylpiperidines to afford both regioisomeric beta-aminoalcohols 22 and 23. In radioligand receptor binding studies, the indazolyl derivative 18a, which can be regarded as indazole bioisostere of ifenprodil, showed high GluN2B affinity (K-i = 31 nM). Replacement of the benzylic OH moiety of ifenprodil by the NH2 moiety in amino-ifenprodil 12 also resulted in low nanomolar GluN2B affinity (K-i = 72 nM). In TEVC experiments, 18a inhibited the ion flux to the same extent as ifenprodil proving that the phenol of ifenprodil can be replaced bioisosterically by an indazole ring maintaining affinity and inhibitory activity. Whereas 10-fold selectivity was found for the ifenprodil binding site over sigma(1) receptors, only low preference for the GluN2B receptor over s2 receptors was detected. The log D-7.4 value of 18a (log D-7.4 = 2.08) indicates promising bioavailability.

Quinuclidine and DABCO Enhance the Radiofluorination of 5-Substituted 2-Halopyridines	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Fluorinated compounds; Fluorine; Radiofluorination; Organocatalysis; Halopyridines; Reactive intermediates	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NUCLEOPHILIC AROMATIC-SUBSTITUTION; FULLY AUTOMATED RADIOSYNTHESIS; PET RADIOLIGAND; FLUORINATION; ENANTIOMERS; TRACER	Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important molecular imaging technique for medical diagnosis, biomedical research and drug development. PET tracers for molecular imaging contain (+)-emitting radionuclides, such as carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min). The [F-18]2-fluoropyridyl moiety features in a few prominent PET radiotracers, not least because this moiety is usually resistant to unwanted radiodefluorination in vivo. Various methods have been developed for labeling these radiotracers from cyclotron-produced no-carrier-added [F-18]fluoride ion, mainly based on substitution of a leaving group, such as halide (Cl or Br), or preferably a better leaving group, such as nitro or trimethylammonium. However, precursors with a good leaving group are sometimes more challenging or lengthy to prepare. Methods for enhancing the reactivity of more readily accessible 2-halopyridyl precursors are therefore desirable, especially for early radiotracer screening programs that may require the quick labeling of several homologous radiotracer candidates. In this work, we explored a wide range of additives for beneficial effect on nucleophilic substitution by [F-18]fluoride ion in 5-substituted 2-halopyridines (halo = Cl or Br). The nucleophilic cyclic tertiary amines, quinuclidine and DABCO, proved effective for increasing yields to practically useful levels (> 15%). Quinuclidine and DABCO likely promote radiofluorination through reversible formation of quaternary ammonium intermediates.

However, the invivo selectivity of the ligand remains unknown and a full assessment of different analysis approaches has yet to be performed. Using human heterologous competition data, with [C-11]Ro15-4513 and the highly selective GABA(A)5 selective negative allosteric modulator Basmisanil (RG1662), we quantify the GABA(A)5 selectivity of [C-11]Ro15-4513, assess the validity of reference tissues and evaluate the performance of four different kinetic analysis methods. The results show that [C-11]Ro15-4513 has high but not complete selectivity for GABA(A)5, with 5 representing around 60-70% of the specific binding in 5 rich regions. Competition data indicate that the cerebellum and pons are essentially devoid of 5 signal and might be used as reference regions under certain conditions. Off-target non-selective binding to other GABA(A) subtypes means that the choice of analysis method and the interpretation of outcome measures must be considered carefully. We discuss the merits of two tissue compartmental model analyses to derive both V-T and V-S, band-pass spectral analysis for estimation of V5 and the simplified reference tissue model for estimation of BPND.

Using the second-generation TSPO-targeted radiotracer, [C-11]DPA-713, we conducted a positron emission tomography (PET) study to compare the brains of 12 healthy human subjects to those of 23 individuals with HIV who were effectively treated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). Compared to PET data from age-matched healthy control subjects, [C-11]DPA-713 PET of individuals infected with HIV demonstrated significantly higher volume-of-distribution (V-T) ratios in white matter, cingulate cortex, and supramarginal gyrus, relative to overall gray matter V-T, suggesting localized glial cell activation in susceptible regions. Regional TSPO abnormalities were evident within a sub-cohort of neuro-asymptomatic HIV subjects, and an increase in the V-T ratio within frontal cortex was specifically linked to individuals affected with HIV-associated dementia. These findings were enabled by employing a gray matter normalization approach for PET data quantification, which improved test-retest reproducibility, intra-class correlation within the healthy control cohort, and sensitivity of uncovering abnormal regional findings.

Method: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and Jurkat cells were treated with HIV-1 nef protein alone or together with N15P at different doses and time points. The competitive binding effect of N15P against nef was assessed via radioligand binding assays. Apoptosis was evaluated via terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The level of nuclear FOXO3a and phospho-FOXO3a was assessed by Western blotting. Results: The interaction of I-125-nef with Jurkat cells was inhibited by N15P in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 value of 0.3516 ng/ml. N15P protect against nef protein-induced apoptosis in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. The proapoptotic effect of extracellular nef protein in cells was associated with FOXO3a pathway and the changes in intracellular processes were blocked by N15P in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: N15P inhibits the apoptosis of uninfected CD4(+) T lymphocytes induced by HIV-1 extracellular nef protein. Therefore, N15P is a potential effective CXCR4 antagonist in the course of HIV and could prevent or delay the onset of AIDS.

Steroid resistance in nasal polyposis: role of glucocorticoid receptor and TGF-β1	RHINOLOGY			English	Article						nasal polyposis; resistance; glucocorticoids; glucocorticoid receptor; transforming growth factor-beta 1	CHRONIC RHINOSINUSITIS; MESSENGER-RNA; EXPRESSION; BETA; BUDESONIDE; CELLS; EOSINOPHILS; GALECTIN-1; MECHANISMS; CYTOKINES	Background: Glucocorticoids (GCs) are considered drugs of choice for treating nasal polyps (NPs). However, a subset of patients shows a limited clinical response even to high doses of GCs. Altered expression of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), namely GR-alpha and GR-beta, is a potential mechanism underlying GC insensitivity. GCs modulate the expression of several cytokines, including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), which may contribute to cellular proliferation in NPs. The study investigates some biomolecular features of GC-resistant NPs, and examines possible differences from normal mucosa (NM). Methodology: Radioligand binding assay (binding) was used to determine GR-alpha binding capacity; Western blotting was used to evaluate GR-alpha, GR-beta, and TGF-beta expression and GR-alpha subcellular distribution. NPs were sampled in 32 patients during ethmoidectomy; NM was taken from 15 healthy patients during rhinoplasty. Results: GR-alpha was present in NPs and NM, with lower affinity for the ligand in NPs. GR-alpha was prevalent in the cytosol of NPs that were GR-alpha-negative to the binding assay. GR-beta was expressed in NPs and absent in the majority of NM.TGF-beta 1 expression was higher in NPs than in NM. Conclusions: GR-beta and TGF-beta 1 might be involved in NP pathogenesis, but their role in modulating GC sensitivity is still unclear.

Models were generated using 545 molecules and validated through 258 external molecules tested in PC experiments. We also evaluated the suitability of the best models to predict the activity of 26 proprietary compounds tested in radioligand binding displacement (RBD). Results proved the necessity to use multiple validation sets for a true estimation of model accuracy and demonstrated that using various descriptors and algorithms improves the performance of ligand-based models. Intriguingly, one of the most accurate models uncovered an unexpected link between extent of metabolism and hERG liability. This hypothesis was fairly reinforced by using the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS) that recognized 94% of the hERG inhibitors as extensively metabolized in vivo. Data mining suggested that high Torsades de Pointes (TdP) risk results from an interplay of hERG inhibition, extent of metabolism, active transport, and possibly solubility. Overall, these new findings might improve both the decision making skills of pharmaceutical scientists to mitigate hERG liability during the drug discovery process and the TdP risk assessment during drug development.

The A beta 42 peptide in particular plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer disease pathogenesis and represents a major drug target. Several gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs), such as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (R)-flurbiprofen and sulindac sulfide, have been suggested to modulate the Alzheimer-related A beta production by targeting the APP. Here, we describe novel GSMs that are selective for A beta modulation and do not impair processing of Notch, EphB2, or EphA4. The GSMs modulate A beta both in cell and cell-free systems as well as lower amyloidogenic A beta 42 levels in the mouse brain. Both radioligand binding and cellular cross-competition experiments reveal a competitive relationship between the AstraZeneca (AZ) GSMs and the established second generation GSM, E2012, but a noncompetitive interaction between AZ GSMs and the first generation GSMs (R)-flurbiprofen and sulindac sulfide. The binding of a H-3-labeledAZGSManalog does not co-localize with APP but overlaps anatomically with a gamma-secretase targeting inhibitor in rodent brains. Combined, these data provide compelling evidence of a growing class of in vivo active GSMs, which are selective for A beta modulation and have a different mechanism of action compared with the original class of GSMs described.

In assays using thioflavin S (ThS) as a competitive ligand, FPPDB competed with ThS well and showed high affinity for both tau and A beta(1-42) aggregates (K-i = 13.0 and 20.0 nM, respectively). The results of saturation binding assays also verified that FPPDB bound to both tau and A beta(1-42) aggregates with high affinity (K-d = 44.8 nM and B-max = 45.8 pmol/nmol protein for tau aggregates and K-d = 45.4 nM and B-max = 38.9 pmol/nmol protein for A beta(1-42) aggregates). Furthermore, [F-18]FPPDB substantially labeled NFTs and senile plaques in AD brain sections but not control brain sections. In biodistribution experiments using normal mice, [F-18]FPPDB displayed higher uptake (4.28% ID/g at 2 min postinjection) into and washout (2.53% ID/g at 60 min postinjection) from the brain with time. On the basis of the chemical structure of FPPDB, further increases in selective binding to tau aggregates may lead to the development of more useful probes for the imaging of NFTs in AD brains.

The analysis revealed that the specific binding of [3 H]PE21 occurs within a homogeneous population of binding sites in these membranes. The relatively slow binding process was characterized by the pseudo-first-order rate constant k(obs). The plot of these rate constants versus free radioligand concentration was hyperbolic, demonstrating that at least two kinetically distinguishable steps can be identified in the interaction of dopamine transporter with this inhibitor. The fast and reversible binding step, characterized by dissociation constant K-A = 51 +/- 23 nM, is followed by a slow but also reversible isomerization step of the complex, characterized by the isomerization rate constant k(i) = (7 +/- 2)10(-2) s(-1) and by the rate constant k(-i) = (3.9 +/- 0.5)10(-3) s(-1) for the reverse process. This isomerization step increases the apparent affinity of the ligand and probably consists of a conformational transition of the transporter protein, induced by the inhibitor molecule.

Two thyroid transport proteins (TPs), thyroxine binding globulin (TBG) and recombinant transthyretin (rTTR), were applied in an inhibition assay format in a Biacore 3000 using CM5 biosensor chips coated with L-thyroxine (T4), the main hormone of the thyroid system. Assay conditions were optimized for the natural thyroid hormones, and known thyroid disruptors and structurally related compounds were selected as model compounds to be tested in both assays for their relative potency (RP) compared to T4. The chosen compounds were halogenated phenols, halogenated bisphenols, bisphenol A, 3,5-dichlorobiphenyl, and its hydroxylated metabolite 4-hydroxy-3,5-dichlorobiphenyl (4-OH PCB 14). The TBG-based assay was highly specific for T4, and the rTTR-based assay was sensitive toward several compounds, the highest sensitivity (RP = 4.4) being obtained with 4-OH PCB 14, followed by tetrabromobisphenol A (RP = 1.5) and tetrachlorobisphenol A (RP = 0.75). For the bioeffect-related screening of known and identification of possible new thyroid disruptors, the TPs-based biosensor assays were more sensitive (IC50 of 13.7 +/- 1.3 and 8.6 +/- 10.7 nM for the rTTR and the TBG-based assay, respectively), easier to perform, and faster alternatives (10 min/sample) than the currently used methods such as radioligand binding assays and immunoprecipitation-HPLC.

J	Schneider, T; Hein, P; Bai, J; Michel, MC				Schneider, T; Hein, P; Bai, J; Michel, MC			A role for muscarinic receptors or rho-kinase in hypertension associated rat bladder dysfunction?	JOURNAL OF UROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	98th Annual Meeting of the American-Urological-Association	APR 26-MAY 01, 2003	CHICAGO, IL	Amer Urol Assoc		hypertension; receptors, muscarinic; rho-associated kinase; bladder; rats	CARBACHOL-INDUCED CONTRACTION; URINARY-BLADDER; EXPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; M-2	Purpose: Essential arterial hypertension is a frequent condition. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) show bladder dysfunction similar to that seen in patients with overactive bladder. Since muscarinic receptors and rho-kinase have a key role in the regulation of bladder contractility, we determined whether alterations of either one might contribute to hypertension associated bladder dysfunction. Materials and Methods: The bladders of SHRs and normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs) were compared in in vitro radioligand binding and contractility studies. Results: The mean total number of muscarinic receptors +/- SEM (181 +/- 14 vs 191 +/- 22 fmol/mg protein) and the relative roles of their subtypes were similar in SHRs and WKYs. Contractile responses to the muscarinic agonist carbachol (maximum effect 2.04 +/- 0.24 vs 2.05 +/- 0.14 mN/mm strip length and -log EC50 5.61 +/- 0.07 vs 5.64 +/- 0.04) and to KCl in a receptor independent manner were similar in the 2 strains. The M-3 selective antagonist darifenacin inhibited carbachol responses much more potently than the M-2 selective antagonist methoctramine but the potency of the 2 drugs was similar in each strain. The rho-kinase inhibitor Y27,632 attenuated carbachol induced contraction in a quantitatively similar manner in SHRs and WKYs. Conclusions: An altered function of muscarinic receptor subtypes or rho-kinase does not appear to contribute to bladder dysfunction in SHRs.

The biological effects of octopamine and the pharmacology of octopamine receptors have been extensively studied in the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. This paper reports the cloning of the first octopamine receptor from Periplaneta americana. A cDNA encoding a putative 7 transmembrane receptor was isolated from the head of Periplaneta americana. The encoded protein contains 628 amino acids and has sequence similarity to other biogenic amine receptors. This protein was expressed in COS-7 cells for radioligand binding studies using the antagonist H-3-yohimbine. Competitive binding comparing biogenic amines that could potentially function as endogenous ligands demonstrated this receptor had the highest affinity for octopamine (K-i = 13.3 muM) followed by tyramine, dopamine, serotonin and histamine. Octopamine increased both cAMP levels (EC50 = 1.62 muM) and intracellular concentrations of calcium through the receptor expressed in HEK-293 cells. Tyramine increased levels of both of these second messengers but only at significantly higher concentrations than octopamine. The cAMP increase by octopamine was independent of the increase in calcium. Competitive binding with antagonists revealed this receptor is similar to Lym oa(1) from Lymnaea stagnalis. The data indicate that this cDNA is the first octopamine receptor cloned from Periplaneta americana and therefore has been named Pa oa(1). (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Following administration of 98+/-6 MBq [I-123]5-I-A-85380, serial whole-body images were acquired over 24 h and corrected for attenuation. One to four brain single-photon emission tomography (SPET) images were also acquired between 2.5 and 24 h. Estimates of radiation absorbed dose were calculated using MIRDOSE 3.1 with a dynamic bladder model and a dynamic gastrointestinal tract model. The estimates of the highest absorbed dose (muGy/MBq) were for the urinary bladder wall (71 and 140), lower large intestine wall (70 and 72), and upper large intestine wall (63 and 64), with 2.4-h and 4.8-h urine voiding intervals, respectively. The whole brain activity at the time of the initial whole-body imaging at 14 min was 5.0% of the injected dose. Consistent with the known distribution of alpha4beta2 nAChRs, SPET images showed the highest activity in the thalamus. These results suggest that [I-123]5-I-A-85380 is a promising SPET agent to image alpha4beta2 nAChRs in humans, with acceptable dosimetry and high brain uptake.

We attempted to identify the functional importance of intracellular domains of the cholecystokinin (CCK) receptor by their over-expression in receptor-bearing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-CCKR) cell lines. Although clathrin-dependent endocytosis and recycling of this receptor are well-established (J Cell Biol 128: 1029-1042, 1995), any influence of distinct receptor domains is not understood. In this work, constructs representing each of the intracellular domains of the CCK receptor were coexpressed with wild-type receptor, and stable clonal cell lines were selected. Each was characterized for ligand binding and agonist-stimulated biological activity (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate generation), desensitization, resensitization, receptor internalization, and recycling. Each cell line expressed normal CCK radioligand binding, signaling, internalization, and desensitization. Three independent cell lines that coexpressed the 25-residue second intracellular loop domain exhibited deficient resensitization. In morphological assessment of receptor trafficking, this construct was also shown to interfere with receptor recycling to the plasma membrane. As a control, recycling of an unrelated G protein-coupled receptor was demonstrated to occur normally in this cell line. These observations suggest that rather than representing passive cargo within an endosome, a receptor can influence its own trafficking within the cell.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]LW223 has low non-displaceable binding in murine brain, enabling high sensitivity TSPO PET imaging	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article; Early Access						[F-18]LW223; PET; TSPO; VND; brain	18-KDA TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; RAT MODEL; INFLAMMATION; NEUROINFLAMMATION; RADIOLIGAND; AFFINITY; RODENTS	Neuroinflammation is associated with a number of brain diseases, making it a common feature of cerebral pathology. Among the best-known biomarkers for neuroinflammation in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) research is the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). This study aims to investigate the binding kinetics of a novel TSPO PET radiotracer, [F-18]LW223, in mice and specifically assess its volume of non-displaceable binding (V-ND) in brain as well as investigate the use of simplified analysis approaches for quantification of [F-18]LW223 PET data. Adult male mice were injected with [F-18]LW223 and varying concentrations of LW223 (0.003-0.55 mg/kg) to estimate VND of [F-18]LW223. Dynamic PET imaging with arterial input function studies and radiometabolite studies were conducted. Simplified quantification methods, standard uptake values (SUV) and apparent volume of distribution (VTapp), were investigated. [F-18]LW223 had low VND in the brain (<10% of total binding) and low radiometabolism (similar to 15-20%). The 2-tissue compartment model provided the best fit for [F-18]LW223 PET data, although its correlation with SUV90-120min or V-Tapp allowed for [F-18]LW223 brain PET data quantification in healthy animals while using simpler experimental and analytical approaches. [F-18]LW223 has the required properties to become a successful TSPO PET radiotracer.	[Knyzeliene, Agne; Macaskill, Mark G.; Alcaide-Corral, Carlos J.; Morgan, Timaeus E. F.; Tavares, Adriana A.

Platform Reagents Enable Synthesis of Ligand-Directed Covalent Probes: Study of Cannabinoid Receptor 2 in Live Cells	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							CB2 RECEPTORS; TOSYL CHEMISTRY; IN-VITRO; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; CHEMICAL TOOLS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NATIVE FKBP12; HIGH-AFFINITY; EXPRESSION; FLUOROPHORE	Pharmacological modulation of cannabinoid receptor type2 (CB2R) holds promise for the treatment of neuroinflammatorydisorders,such as Alzheimer's disease. Despite the importance of CB2R, its expression and downstream signaling are insufficientlyunderstood in disease- and tissue-specific contexts. Herein, we reportthe first ligand-directed covalent (LDC) labeling of CB2R enabled by a novel synthetic strategy and application of platformreagents. The LDC modification allows visualization and study of CB2R while maintaining its ability to bind other ligands at theorthosteric site. We employed in silico docking and molecular dynamicssimulations to guide probe design and assess the feasibility of LDClabeling of CB2R. We demonstrate selective, covalent labelingof a peripheral lysine residue of CB2R by exploiting fluorogenic O-nitrobenzoxadiazole (O-NBD)-functionalizedprobes in a TR-FRET assay. The rapid proof-of-concept validation with O-NBD probes inspired incorporation of advanced electrophilessuitable for experiments in live cells. To this end, novel syntheticstrategies toward N-sulfonyl pyridone (N-SP) and N-acyl-N-alkyl sulfonamide(NASA) LDC probes were developed, which allowed covalent deliveryof fluorophores suitable for cellular studies. The LDC probes werecharacterized by a radioligand binding assay and TR-FRET experiments.Additionally, the probes were applied to specifically visualize CB2R in conventional and imaging flow cytometry as well as inconfocal fluorescence microscopy using overexpressing and endogenouslyexpressing microglial live cells.

For performing the same clinical tasks with such images, a clinical (rather than numerical) image quality assessment is essential. This process can be automated with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the scarcity of clinical quality readings is a challenge. We hypothesize that exploiting easily available quantitative information in pretext learning tasks or using established pre-trained networks could improve CNN performance for predicting clinical assessments with limited data. CNNs were pre-trained to predict injected dose from image patches extracted from eight real patient datasets, reconstructed using between 0.5% and 100% of the available data. Transfer learning with seven different patients was used to predict three clinically scored quality metrics ranging from 0-3: 1) global quality rating; 2) pattern recognition; and 3) diagnostic confidence. This was compared to pre-training via a VGG16 network at varying pre-training levels.

Preclinical dosimetry models and the prediction of clinical doses of novel positron emission tomography radiotracers	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PET RADIOLIGAND; BIODISTRIBUTION; MOUSE; RAT	Dosimetry models using preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) data are commonly employed to predict the clinical radiological safety of novel radiotracers. However, unbiased clinical safety profiling remains difficult during the translational exercise from preclinical research to first-in-human studies for novel PET radiotracers. In this study, we assessed PET dosimetry data of six F-18-labelled radiotracers using preclinical dosimetry models, different reconstruction methods and quantified the biases of these predictions relative to measured clinical doses to ease translation of new PET radiotracers to first-in-human studies. Whole-body PET images were taken from rats over 240 min after intravenous radiotracer bolus injection. Four existing and two novel PET radiotracers were investigated: [F-18]FDG, [F-18]AlF-NOTA-RGDfK, [F-18]AlF-NOTA-octreotide ([F-18]AlF-NOTA-OC), [F-18]AlF-NOTA-NOC, [F-18]ENC2015 and [F-18]ENC2018. Filtered-back projection (FBP) and iterative methods were used for reconstruction of PET data. Predicted and true clinical absorbed doses for [F-18]FDG and [F-18]AlF-NOTA-OC were then used to quantify bias of preclinical model predictions versus clinical measurements. Our results show that most dosimetry models were biased in their predicted clinical dosimetry compared to empirical values. Therefore, normalization of rat:human organ sizes and correction for reconstruction method biases are required to achieve higher precision of dosimetry estimates.

Three groups were recruited: (1) active pulmonary TB; (2) IGRA-positive household TB contacts; (3) pneumonia (non-TB). DOTANOC PET/MRI followed by FDG PET/MRI was performed in active TB and pneumonia groups. TB contacts underwent FDG PET/MRI, then DOTANOC PET/MRI if abnormalities were detected. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed for total lung and individual lesions. Eight active TB participants, three TB contacts and three pneumonia patients had paired PET/MRI scans. In the active TB group, median SUVmax([FDG]) for parenchymal lesions was 7.69 (range 3.00-15.88); median SUVmax([DOTANOC]) was 2.59 (1.48-6.40). Regions of tracer uptake were fairly similar for both radioligands, albeit more diffusely distributed in the FDG scans. In TB contacts, two PET/MRIs had parenchymal lesions detected with FDG (SUVmax 5.50 and 1.82), with corresponding DOTANOC uptake <1. FDG and DOTANOC uptake was similar in pneumonia patients (SUVmax([FDG]) 4.17-6.18; SUVmax([DOTANOC]) 2.92-4.78). DOTANOC can detect pulmonary TB lesions, but FDG is more sensitive for both active and sub-clinical lesions. FDG remains the preferred ligand for clinical studies, although DOTANOC may provide additional value for pathogenesis studies.	[Naftalin, Claire M.; Hallinan, James T. P.

Herein, we characterize the binding mode of 20 novel analogs and propose the molecular determinants driving BGT1-selectivity. A series of N-1-, exocyclic-N-, and C-4-substituted analogs was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized in radioligand-based uptake assays at the four human GABA transporters (hGATs) recombinantly expressed in mammalian cells. Overall, the analogs retained subtype-selectivity for hBGT1, though with lower inhibitory activities (mid to high micromolar IC50 values) compared to ATPCA. Further characterization of five of these BGT1-active analogs in a fluorescence-based FMP assay revealed that the compounds are substrates for hBGT1, suggesting they interact with the orthosteric site of the transporter. In silico-guided mutagenesis experiments showed that the non-conserved residues Q299 and E52 in hBGT1 as well as the conformational flexibility of the compounds potentially contribute to the subtype-selectivity of ATPCA and its analogs. Overall, this study provides new insights into the molecular interactions governing the subtype-selectivity of BGT1 substrate-inhibitors. The findings may guide the rational design of BGT1-selective pharmacological tool compounds for future drug discovery.

To determine if these abnormalities could be identified in vivo, we investigated mGluR5 availability in 10 patients with focal epilepsy and an MRI diagnosis of FCD using positron-emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [C-11]ABP688. Partial volume corrected [C-11]ABP688 binding potentials (BPND) were computed using the cerebellum as a reference region. Each patient was compared to homotopic cortical regions in 33 healthy controls using region-of-interest (ROI) and vertex-wise analyses. Reduced [C-11]ABP688 BPND in the FCD was seen in 7/10 patients with combined ROI and vertex-wise analyses. Reduced FCD BPND was found in 4/5 operated patients (mean follow-up: 63 months; Engel I), of whom surgical specimens revealed FCD type IIb or IIa, with most balloon cells showing negative or weak mGluR5 immunoreactivity as compared to their respective neuropil and normal neurons at the border of resections. [C-11]ABP688 PET shows for the first time in vivo evidence of reduced mGluR5 availability in FCD, indicating focal glutamatergic alterations in malformations of cortical development, which cannot be otherwise clearly demonstrated through resected tissue analyses.

By therapeutic inhibition of PDE4, intracellular cAMP levels can be stabilized, and the symptoms of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders including depression, memory loss and Parkinson's disease can be ameliorated. Radiotracers targeting PDE4 can be used to study PDE4 density and function, and evaluate new PDE4 therapeutics, in vivo in a non-invasive way, as has been shown using the carbon-11 labeled PDE4 inhibitor R-(-)-rolipram. Herein we describe a small series of rolipram analogs that contain fluoro- or iodo-substituents that could be used as fluorine-18 PET or iodine-123 SPECT PDE4 radiotracers. This series was evaluated with an in vitro binding assay and a 4-(fluoromethyl) derivative of rolipram, MNI-617, was identified, with a five-fold increase in affinity for PDE4 (K-d=0.26nM) over R-(-)-rolipram (K-d=1.6nM). A deutero-analogue d(2)-[F-18]MNI-617 was radiolabeled and produced in 23% yield with high (>5Ci/mu mol) specific activity and evaluated in non-human primate, where it rapidly entered the brain, with SUVs between 4 and 5, and with a distribution pattern consistent with that of PDE4.

We explored the association between verbal memory and 5-HT1A receptor binding in 24 healthy subjects (14 male, 10 female, aged 18-41 years). The cognitive tests included the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R), Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). 5-HT1A receptor binding was measured with PET and the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635, which was quantified with the gold standard method based on kinetic modeling using arterial blood samples. We found that global 5-HT1A receptor binding was positively correlated with measures of verbal memory, such that subjects who had higher receptor binding tended to have better verbal memory than subjects who had lower receptor binding. Regional analyses suggested significant correlations in multiple neocortical brain regions and the raphe nuclei. We did not find significant correlations between 5-HT1A receptor binding and executive functions as measured with WCST. We conclude that neocortical as well as raphe 5-HT1A receptors are involved in verbal memory function in man. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

Positron emission tomography molecular imaging for drug development	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						drug development; molecular imaging; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics; positron emission tomography (PET)	PROOF-OF-CONCEPT; HUMAN BRAIN; PET; RECEPTOR; TUMOR; TEMOZOLOMIDE; DELINEATION; ACTIVATION; PREDICTION; OCCUPANCY	Human in vivo molecular imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) enables a new kind of precision pharmacology, able to address questions central to drug development. Biodistribution studies with drug molecules carrying positron-emitting radioisotopes can test whether a new chemical entity reaches a target tissue compartment (such as the brain) in sufficient amounts to be pharmacologically active. Competition studies, using a radioligand that binds to the target of therapeutic interest with adequate specificity, enable direct assessment of the relationship between drug plasma concentration and target occupancy. Tailored radiotracers can be used to measure relative rates of biological processes, while radioligands specific for tissue markers expected to change with treatment can provide specific pharmacodynamic information. Integrated application of PET and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods allows molecular interactions to be related directly to anatomical or physiological changes in a tissue. Applications of imaging in early drug development can suggest approaches to patient stratification for a personalized medicine able to deliver higher value from a drug after approval. Although imaging experimental medicine adds complexity to early drug development and costs per patient are high, appropriate use can increase returns on R and D investment by improving early decision making to reduce new drug attrition in later stages. We urge that the potential value of a translational molecular imaging strategy be considered routinely and at the earliest stages of new drug development.

HEK293 alpha(1A) cell line, which expresses stably high levels of alpha(1A)AR, was used to prepare the stationary phase in the CMC model. The HEK293 alpha(1A)/CMC-offline-HPLC system was applied to specifically recognize the ligands which interact with the alpha(1A)AR, and the dissociation equilibrium constants (K-D) obtained from the model were (1.87 +/- 0.13) x 10(-6) M for tamsulosin, (2.86 +/- 0.20) x 10(-6) M for 5-methylurapidil, (3.01 +/- 0.19) x 10(-6) M for doxazosin, (3.44 +/- 0.19) x 10(-6) M for terazosin, (3.50 +/- 0.21) x 10(-6) M for alfuzosin, and (7.57 +/- 0.31) x 10(-6) M for phentolamine, respectively. The competitive binding study between tamsulosin and terazosin indicated that the two drugs interacted at the common binding site of alpha(1A)AAR. However, that was not the case between tamsulosin and oxymetazoline. The results had a positive correlation with those from radioligand binding assay and indicated that the CMC method combined modified competitive binding could be a quick and efficient way for characterizing the drug-receptor interactions.

The low-affinity sites for [H-3] CGP12177 in the segments was double in density, compared to the density of high-affinity sites. Total abundance of the beta-adrenoceptors decreased to approximately 10% upon tissue homgenization, and the proportion of low-affinity sites was the same as that of the high-affinity sites in the membranes. The majority of the high-affinity binding sites of [H-3]-CGP12177 in the segments and the membranes were beta(1H)-adrenoceptor, being highly sensitive to propranolol and beta(1)-antagonists (atenolol and ICI-89,406), whereas the low-affinity binding sites showed a beta(IL)-profile (less sensitive to propranolol and beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-antagonists). Furthermore, a part of the beta(IL)-adrenoceptors was insensitive to atenolol, ICI-89,406, and/or isoproterenol. The present binding Study clearly shows that beta(1L)-adrenoceptors Occur as a distinct phenotype from beta(1L)-adrenoceptors in rabbit ventricle. However, quantitative imbalance between beta(1H)- and beta(IL)-adrenoceptors and divergent ligand-beta(IL)-adrenoceptor interactions suggest a possibility that the beta(1L)-adrenoceptor may not reflect a simple conformational change or allosteric state in the beta(1)-adrenoceptor molecule.

Postmortem studies suggest decreased 5-HT1A receptors in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), but this has not been confirmed in vivo. Our primary objective was to assess the extent of 5-HT1A receptor losses in mild to moderate AD. Methods: The authors examined 5-HT1A receptors in 10 patients with mild to moderate AD and 10 healthy volunteers with the same sex and similar age using positron emission tomography imaging with the selective 5-HT1A receptor radioligand, [C-11] WAY-100635. Regions of interest (ROIs) were manually drawn on coregistered magnetic resonance images for the frontal, lateral temporal, medial temporal (MTC), parietal, and cerebellar cortices. Using the simplified reference tissue model, 5-HT1A binding potentials (BPs) were calculated relative to the cerebellum. Results: After adjusting for partial volume effects, ROI analysis showed a significant group effect (AD versus comparison group) on BP. Analysis of between-subjects factors showed significantly decreased 5-HT1A BP in the right MTC, but not in the other ROIs. Conclusion: Given the strategic role of these receptors, loss of right medial temporal 5-HT1A receptors might play an important role in AD symptomatology.

MERCK 1, MERCK 2, and MERCK 3 are novel NR2B subtype selective NMDA receptor antagonists. The affinity and the kinetic mechanism of inhibition by these antagonists and ifenprodil were investigated using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique, calcium flux, and radioligand binding on a mouse cell line L(tk-) expressing recombinant human heteromeric NMDA receptors consisting of NR1a/NR2B subunit combinations. The rank order of potency, as determined by electrophysiology, was ifenprodil < MERCK 2 < MERCK 1 < MERCK 3 with K-D's 79 +/- 8, 2.4 +/- 1.1, 1.3 +/- 0.9, and similar to 0.16 +/- 0.02 nM, respectively. The apparent dissociation rate constants among these compounds differed by as much as 394-fold whereas the apparent association constants varied less than 3-fold. Higher affinities were a result of slower drug dissociation kinetics of receptor unbinding. Maximal inhibition was not voltage-dependent and was not statistically different at saturating concentrations by these compounds. These results provide the first detailed functional analysis of the kinetic mechanism of MERCK 1, MERCK 2, and MERCK 3 inhibition of NMDA receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Full-length cDNA encoding alpha(1B)-AR was transfected into HEK293 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method, and alpha(1B)-AR expression and cAMP accumulation were determined by using the saturation radioligand binding assay and ion-exchange chromatography, respectively. Results: Under agonist stimulation, alpha(1B)-AR mediated cAMP synthesis in HEK293 cells, and blockade by PLC-PKC or tyrosine kinase did not reduce cAMP accumulation induced by NE. Pretreatment with pertussis toxin (PTX) had little effect on basal cAMP accumulation as well as norepirephrine (NE)-stimulated cAMP accumulation. In addition, pretreatment with cholera toxin (CTX) neither mimicked nor blocked the effect induced by NE. The extracellular Ca2+ chelator egtazic acid (EGTA), nonselective Ca2+ channel blocker CdCl2 and calmodulin (CaM) inhibitor W-7 significantly reduced NE-induced cAMP accumulation from 1.59% +/- 0.47% to 1.00% +/- 0.31%, 0.78% +/- 0.23%, and 0.90% +/- 0.40%, respectively. Conclusion: By coupling with a PTX-insensitive G protein, alpha(1B)-AR promotes Ca2+ influx via receptor-dependent Ca2+ channels, then Ca2+ is linked to CaM to form a Ca2+-CaM complex, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase (AC), thereby increasing the cAMP production in HEK293 cell lines.

Incubation of cells with the N-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin, reduced the molecular weight of the predominant immunoreactive h5-HT3A subunit species (from approximate to59 to 45 kDa) indicating that the h5-HT3A subunit is normally N-glycosylated. Site-directed mutagenesis studies individually substituting four identified N-terminal asparagines (N5, N81, N147, N163) demonstrated that each expressed mutant displayed a reduced molecular weight (by approximate to3 kDa) suggesting that each asparagine residue was subject to N-glycosylation. In addition, 5-HT3 receptor binding studies indicated that prevention of N-glycosylation, by individual amino acid substitution at each of the four asparagine residues, either prevented (N81, N147, N163) or greatly reduced (N5) the production of a 5-HT3 receptor binding site. Corresponding with the radioligand binding studies, immunocytochemical studies demonstrated that substitution of each asparagine either prevented (N81, N147, N163) or reduced considerably (N5) mutant protein expression within the cell membrane. The present study demonstrates an important role for N-glycosylation at multiple identified asparagine residues in the N-terminus of the h5-HT3A receptor subunit. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Study design A multicenter, retrospective study, including the following groups of children with hepatitis C virus infection: (1) 21 consecutive LKMI-positive patients, (2) 42 age- and sex- matched LKM1-negative patients, and (3) 4 interferon-induced LKM1-positive cases. LKM1 reactivity to human microsomes and recombinant cytochrome P450IID6 (CYP2D6) was assayed by immunoblotting. Results Clinical and biochemical features overlapped in LKMI-positive and LKM1-negative children, but a fibrosis score >3 (range 0-6) was significantly more frequent (P =.04) in the former. Reactivity to microsomal protein and CYP2D6 was significantly (P =.02) associated with LKM1. titers greater than or equal to1:320 and was found in 39% of patients, including severe cases and both children (of 4 treated) who achieved a sustained alanine aminotransferase (ALT) normalization after steroid treatment. Five of 7 LKM1-positive children treated with interferon had an ALT exacerbation. Conclusions LKMI-positive hepatitis C in children is characterized by a wide spectrum of biochemical, serologic, and histologic features. Whether autoimmunity may contribute to liver damage in a subgroup of patients with more severe liver disease, high LKM1 titers, and reactivity to CYP2D6 is a question deserving further investigation.

J	Chen, BH; Chung, SB; Chiang, W; Chao, MC				Chen, BH; Chung, SB; Chiang, W; Chao, MC			GAD65 antibody prevalence and association with thyroid antibodies, HLA-DR in Chinese children with type I diabetes mellitus	DIABETES RESEARCH AND CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						GAD65; thyroid autoimmune antibody; residual beta cell function; HLA-DR	GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; BETA-CELL FUNCTION; ADULT-ONSET IDDM; PRIMERS PCR-SSP; INSULIN; AUTOANTIBODIES; AUTOIMMUNITY; ISOFORM; ASSAY; AGE	Persistent humoral autoimmunity to the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) has been described in a substantial proportion of patients with type I diabetes mellitus. Higher prevalence of GAD antibody in diabetes patients using a new radioligand-binding assay with recombinant human GAD65 antibodies (GAD65Ab) has been seen in several studies. Using this method, we have reassessed the prevalence of GAD65Ab and investigated the association of GAD65Ab with HbAlC values, C-peptide values, HLA-DR typing and thyroid autoimmune antibody in 70 Chinese children with type I diabetes mellitus (mean age of onset 8.21 +/- 3.84 years. mean duration 3.39 +/- 2.54 years). Our result revealed that GAD65 antibodies were present in 54.3% (38/70) of diabetes children. There was no significant difference in gender, diabetes onset and duration, HbAlc, C-peptide concentration and frequencies of HLA DR3, DR4, DR9, DR3/DR4, DR3/DR9 and DR4/DR9 genotypes between GAD65Ab(+) and GAD65Ab(-) groups. There was no negative correlation between GAD65Ab values and duration of diabetes in those with GAD65Ab positivity (r = -0.239, P > 0.05). The frequencies of antimicrosomal and anti-thyroglobulin antibodies in GAD65Ab(+) (13.5, 8.1%, respectively) were not different from GAD65(-) patients (9.4, 12.5%, respectively).

THERAPIE			French	Article; Proceedings Paper	6th Congress of Clinical Pharmacologie	NOV, 2000	CARTHAGE, TUNISIA			ischaemia; sigma receptors; rat brain; binding; cocaine	MOLECULAR-CLONING; LIGANDS; COCAINE; BRAIN; BINDING; SITES; INHIBITION; DOG	Sigma receptors are present in many organs and several functions are allotted to them but the specificity of their effect remains to be established. Indeed, all the molecules known to interact with these receptors also have affinities for other receptors. Recently, sigma-1 receptors were implied in the processes of cellular protection, several of their ligands slowing a neuroprotector effect in various models of cerebral ischaemia. S-16950, a trimetazidine derivative, is a powerful anti-ischaemic drug on a hepatic model of ischaemia-reperfusion. It is structurally closely related to SA4503, a sigma receptor ligand showing also an anti-ischaemic action. Our study shows that S-16950 inhibits the binding of [H-3]pentazocine, a selective sigma-1 receptor radioligand, to rat brain membranes with a high affinity (IC50=7 nM). This affinity is equivalent to the most potent sigma ligand such as haloperidol. Its affinity is 170 times higher for the sigma-1 subtype than for the sigma-2 subtype. The effect of Gpp[NH]p on S-16950 inhibition of [H-3]pentazocine binding and the potentiation of the convulsivant effect of cocaine under the action of S-16950 suggest that this molecule may act as an agonist. These results indicate that S-16950 is a new sigma ligand and reinforce the assumption of a link between sigma receptors and a cytoprotective activity.

Methods: We applied the Caco-2VCR cells to a 96-well plate-based calcein AM extrusion assay. The Caco-2VCR cells were cultured as monolayers and incubated with calcein AM with/without addition of Pgp modulators. Fourteen known Pgp modulators were tested in the assay (chloropromazine, cyclosporin A, domperidone, digoxin, ivermectin, ketoconazole, loperamide, metoprolol, propranolol, progesterone, quinidine, quinine, verapamil and vincristine). For each compound an EC50 value was calculated. Protein and mRNA levels of the efflux transporters were analysed by Western blot and polymerase chain reaction techniques. Results: All compounds with the exception of digoxin displayed increased calcein levels. Protein and mRNA analysis showed increased levels of Pgp after vincristine exposure, while expression of the efflux transporters MRP1 and MRP2 remained unchanged. Conclusions: The calcein AM extrusion assay applied to Caco-2VCR cells can be a valuable tool as a screening assay for new compounds and their potential interaction with P-glycoprotein.

PDE4C and PDE4D) mRNAs in the brain of different species by in situ hybridization histochemistry and by autoradiography with [H-3]rolipram. We have compared the localization of each isozyme in human brain with that in rat and monkey brain. We have Found that the four PDE4 isoforms display a differential expression pattern at both regional and cellular level in the three species. PDE4A. PDE4B and PDE4D are widely distributed in human brain, with the two latter appearing more abundant. In contrast, PDE4C in human brain, presents a more restricted distribution, limited to cortex, some thalamic nuclei and cerebellum. This is at variance with the distribution of PDE4C in rat brain, where it is found exclusively in olfactory bulb. In monkey brain, the highest expression for this isoform is found in the claustrum, and at lower levels in cortical areas and cerebellum PDE4B presented a broad distribution, being expressed in both neuronal and non neuronal cell populations. In general, the distribution of binding sites visualized with [H-3]rolipram correlated well with the expression of each PDE4 isozyme. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Indeed, extensive data support the involvement of the sigma(2) receptor in neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, alcohol abuse and pain. Due to its serious side effects which prevent ibogaine from potential clinical applications, novel ibogaine derivatives endowed with improved sigma(2) receptor affinity may be particularly beneficial. With the purpose to facilitate the investigation of iboga alkaloid derivatives which may serve as templates for the design of selective sigma(2) receptor ligands, here we report a deconstruction study on the ibogaine tricyclic moiety and a successive scaffold-hopping of the indole counterpart. A 3D-QSAR model has been applied to predict the sigma(2) pK(i) values of the new compounds, whereas a molecular docking study conducted upon the sigma(2) receptor built by homology modeling was used to further validate the best-scored molecules. We eventually evaluated pinoline, a carboline derivative, for sigma(2) receptor affinity through radioligand binding assay and the results confirmed the predicted high mu M range of affinity and good selectivity. The obtained results could be helpful in the drug design process of new ibogaine simplified analogs with improved sigma(2) receptor binding capabilities.

All compounds exhibited high binding affinities toward the synthetic A beta(1-42) aggregate and/or Alzheimer's disease brain homogenate. In the microPET study with normal mice, the 3-[F-18]fluoro-2-hydroxypropyl substituted compounds resulted in fast brain washout by reducing the lipophilicities of the compounds. Intriguingly, (S)-configured PET tracers, (S)-[F-18]1b and (S)-[F-18]1c, exhibited a 2.8 and 4.0-fold faster brain washout rate at a peak/30 min in the mouse brain than the corresponding (R)-configured PET tracers despite there being no meaningful difference in binding affinities toward A beta plaque. A further evaluation of (S)-[F-18]1c with healthy rhesus monkeys also revealed excellent clearance from the frontal cortex with ratios of 7.0, 16.0, 30.0 and 49.0 at a peak/30, 60, 90, and 120 min, respectively. These results suggest that (S)-[F-18]1c may be a potential PET tracer for imaging A beta plaque in a living brain. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to investigate the expression of CCK and IP3 receptors in patients with gallbladder stones and T2DM and its correlation with the hypomotility of the gallbladder. Methodology: 26 patients with gallstones and T2DM (Group 1) and 24 gallstones patients without T2DM (Group 2) were enrolled in this study. The emptying function of the gallbladder was measured by ultrasonography. The activity of CCK-R was analyzed by radioligand method and the IP3-R antibody was used to detect the IP3-R from patients in both groups. Results: Gallbladder ejection volume (EV) ((11.6 +/- 5.1) ml(3) vs (21.5 +/- 7.8) ml(3)) and gallbladder ejection fraction (GBEF(2))(%)((17.2 +/- 11.3) ml(3) vs (52.8 +/- 12.9) ml(3)) were significantly lower (P<0.01) in patients with gallstones and T2DM. The amount of CCK-R and the activity of CCK-R in Group 1 were significantly lower than that in Group 2 (P<0.01). And IP3-R in Group 1 was much lower than that in Group 2, as well (P<0.01). Conclusion: The expression of CCK-R and IP3-R in gallstones patients with T2DM was much lower in such patients, leading to impaired gallbladder emptying function and the formation of gallstones.

Although [H-3]-melatonin has the advantage of corresponding to the endogenous ligand of the receptor, its binding has not been well described. Experimental ApproachWe characterized [H-3]-melatonin binding to the hMT(1) and hMT(2) receptors expressed in a range of cell lines and obtained new insights into the molecular pharmacology of melatonin receptors. Key ResultsThe binding of [H-3]-melatonin to the hMT(1) and hMT(2) receptors displayed two sites on the saturation curves. These two binding sites were observed on cell membranes expressing recombinant receptors from various species as well as on whole cells. Furthermore, our GTPS/NaCl results suggest that these sites on the saturation curves correspond to the G-protein coupled and uncoupled states of the receptors, whose pharmacology was extensively characterized. Conclusions and ImplicationshMT(1) and hMT(2) receptors spontaneously exist in two states when expressed in cell lines; these states can be probed by [H-3]-melatonin binding. Overall, our results suggest that physiological regulation of the melatonin receptors may result from complex and subtle mechanisms, a small difference in affinity between the active and inactive states of the receptor, and spontaneous coupling to G-proteins.

Radiolabeling was achieved by methylation of ethyl 6-bromo-8-(4-((tert-butyldimethylsilyl)oxy)benzamido)-4-oxo-4H-Chromene-2-carboxylate (19) with [H-3]methyl tosylate followed by ester hydrolysis. The radioligand was characterized by kinetic, saturation, and competition assays at membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary cells recombinantly expressing the human GPR35. [H-3]12 labeled the receptor with high affinity (K-D = 5.27 nM). Binding was saturable (B-max = 12.6 pmol/mg of protein) and reversible. Affinities of selected standard ligands and a library of amidochromen-4-one-2-carboxylates were determined. Binding data mostly correlated with potencies determined in beta-arrestin assays. On the basis of the test results, several new fluorine-substituted 6-bromo-8-benzamidochromen-4-one-2-carboxylic acids were obtained, which represent the most potent GPR35 agonists known to date. 6-Bromo-8-(2,6-difluoro-4-methoxybenzamido)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (83; K-i = 0.589 nM, EC50 = 5.54 nM) showed the highest affinity with a K-i value in the subnanomolar range.

An intrinsic CRF signaling system within the optic tectum	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Stress; Appetite; Vision; Amphibian; Anura	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; PREY-CATCHING BEHAVIOR; XENOPUS-LAEVIS; ENDOGENOUS NOREPINEPHRINE; DOPAMINERGIC MODULATION; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; VISUAL RESPONSES; GENE-EXPRESSION	Previous work indicates that CRF administration inhibits visually guided feeding in amphibians. We used the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis to examine the hypothesis that CRF acts as a neurotransmitter in the optic tectum, the major brain area integrating the visual and premotor pathways regulating visually guided feeding in anurans. Reverse transcriptase PCR revealed that cells in the optic tectum express mRNA for CRF and the CRF R1 receptor but not the CRF R2 receptor. Radioligand binding studies indicated that specific binding of [I-125]-Tyr-oCRF to tectal cell membranes can be displaced by the CRF R1 antagonists antalarmin or NBI-27914. CRF increased the expression of mRNA encoding regulator of G-protein signaling 2 (rgs2) in tectal explants and this effect was blocked by antalarmin. CRF had no effect on basal glutamate or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) secretion but inhibited secretion of norepinephrine from tectal explants, an effect that completely blocked by antalarmin. Using a homologous radioimmunoassay we determined that CRF release from tectal explants in vitro was potassium- and calcium-dependent. Basal and depolarization-induced CRF secretion was greater from optic tectum than hypothalamus/thalamus, telencephalon, or brainstem. We concluded that the optic tectum possesses a CRF signaling system that may be involved in modulating communication between sensory and motor pathways involved in food intake. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Specific Uptake of an Amyloid-β Protofibril-Binding Antibody-Tracer in AβPP Transgenic Mouse Brain	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-beta protofibrils; antibody; brain uptake; positron emission tomography; transgenic mice	SENILE PLAQUE-FORMATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MOLECULAR-BASIS; PROTEIN; MODEL; MUTATION; DEPOSITION; DIAGNOSIS; OLIGOMERS; PATHOLOGY	Evidence suggests that amyloid-beta (A beta) protofibrils/oligomers are pathogenic agents in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Unfortunately, techniques enabling quantitative estimates of these species in patients or patient samples are still rather limited. Here we describe the in vitro and ex vivo characteristics of a new antibody-based radioactive ligand, [I-125]mAb158, which binds to A beta protofibrils with high affinity. [I-125]mAb158 was specifically taken up in brain of transgenic mice expressing amyloid-beta protein precursor (A beta PP) as shown ex vivo. This was in contrast to [I-125]mAb-Ly128 which does not bind to A beta. The uptake of intraperitoneally-administered [I-125]mAb158 into the brain was age- and time-dependent, and saturable in A beta PP transgenic mice with modest A beta deposition. Brain uptake was also found in young A beta PP transgenic mice that were devoid of A beta deposits, suggesting that [I-125]mAb158 targets soluble A beta protofibrils. The radioligand was diffusely located in the parenchyma, sometimes around senile plaques and only occasionally colocalized with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. A refined iodine-124-labeled version of mAb158 with much improved blood-brain barrier passage and a shorter plasma half-life might be useful for PET imaging of A beta protofibrils.

It is widely considered that MCH1 receptor antagonists are worthy of development for medical treatment of obesity. Here we report on the development of an ex vivo receptor occupancy assay using a new radiolabeled MCH1 receptor antagonist, [S-35]-compound D. An MCH1 receptor antagonist inhibited the binding of [S-35]- compound D to brain slices in a dose-dependent manner. The result showed a good correlation between the receptor occupancy levels and plasma or brain levels of the MCH1 receptor antagonist, suggesting that the ex vivo receptor binding assay using this radioligand is practical. Quantitative analysis in diet-induced obese mice showed that the efficacy of body weight reduction correlated with the receptor occupancy levels at 24 h. Furthermore, more than 90% occupancy levels of MCH1 receptor antagonists during 24 h post-dosing are required for potent efficacy on body weight reduction. The present occupancy assay could be a useful pharmacodynamic marker to quantitatively estimate anti-obese efficacy, and would accelerate the development of MCH1 receptor antagonists for treatment of obesity.

Genetic and pharmacological manipulations of the CB<sub>1</sub> receptor alter ethanol preference and dependence in ethanol preferring and nonpreferring mice	SYNAPSE			English	Article						alcohol; striatum; CB1 receptor; G-protein; endocannabinoid; anandamide	ACID AMIDE HYDROLASE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINE RELEASE; ALCOHOL-DRINKING; ANTAGONIST SR141716A; BRAIN; WITHDRAWAL; CONSUMPTION; NMDA; PHARMACOTHERAPY	Recent studies have indicated a role for the endocannabinoid system in ethanol-related behaviors. This study examined the effect of pharmacological activation, blockade, and genetic deletion of the CB, receptors on ethanol-drinking behavior in ethanol preferring C57BL/6J (136) and ethanol nonpreferring DBA/2J (D2) mice. The deletion of CB, receptor significantly reduced the ethanol preference. Although the stimulation of the CB1 receptor by CP-55,940 markedly increased the ethanol preference, this effect was found to be greater in 136 than in D2 mice. The antagonism of CB1 receptor function by SR141716A led to a significant reduction in voluntary ethanol preference in 136 than D2 mice. A significant lower hypothermic and greater sedative response to acute ethanol administration was observed in both the strains of CB1 -/- mice than wild-type mice. Interestingly, genetic deletion and pharmacological blockade of the CB1 receptor produced a marked reduction in severity of handling-induced convulsion in both the strains. The radioligand binding studies revealed significantly higher levels of CB1 receptor-stimulated G-protein activation in the striatum of 136 compared to D2 mice. Innate differences in the CB1 receptor function might be one of the contributing factors for higher ethanol drinking behavior.

For this study, 96- well microplate filtration assays were adopted, and the screening parameters including screening window factor ( z factor) and z' factor indicated that the assays adopted were robust and suitable for medium- throughput screening ( MTS). z factor also indicated that data on plant extracts at 10 mu g/ well were more reliable compared to those obtained from 100 mu g/ well. Therefore, only data at 10 mu g/ well in duplicate were used in the determination of actives. In the preliminary screen, 23 plant extracts were found to show activity ( 50% or higher level of inhibition over the mean of all samples for a given plate) in either one or both of the duplicates. Of these, seven were reconfirmed to be active on 5HT1a receptor in the hit confirmation. The active plant extracts were isolated from Popowia odoardoi Diels ( Annonaceae) ( leaf and stem), Artabotrys roseus Boerl. ( Annonaceae) ( bark), Litsea elliptibacea Merr. ( Lauraceae) ( bark), Decaspermum fruticosum Forst. ( Myrtaceae) ( bark), Dyera costulata ( Miq.) Hook. f. ( Apocynaceae) ( leaf), and Irvingia malayana Oliv. ( Simaroubaceae) ( leaf). However, none of the plant extracts tested were active on either GABA(B) or D2S receptors.

The compound itself is fluorescent, and its fluorescence intensity at 408 nm increases upon binding to the ER. Here we describe a novel binding assay in 96-well plate format for estrogenic compounds, based on the competition between fluorescent coumestrol, and estrogenic compounds for binding to the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the ER-alpha. Displacement of coumestrol was measured as a decrease in fluorescence intensity using a Victor-1420 multilabel reader. Competitive binding curves for the well-known estrogenic Compounds, 17 beta-estradiol (E-2), ethinylestradiol, 4-nonylphenol, 4-octylphenol, genistein, bisphenol A, tamoxifen and diethyl-stilbestrol were constructed by using 7-10 different concentrations of the compounds and a fixed concentration of ER-alpha-LBD (14 nmol) and coumestrol (100 nmol). IC50) values and relative potencies (compared to E-2) of the estrogenic compounds were determined. The assay was validated by comparing the relative potencies to those from standard radioligand binding assays in the literature. Within day and between day variations were determined and the performance of the assay was assessed by determining the coefficients of variation and Z ' values. The present fluorescent binding assay has proven to be fast and easy, and allows accurately quantifying the binding affinity of estrogenic ligands. The method is also suitable as a high-throughput screening assay for ER ligands.

In consequence, slowly progressive autoimmune diabetes or LADA is likely to be missed. Antibodies to GAD65 and IA-2 are the major immunological markers in autoimmune diabetes. Recently, a new beta cell antigen, called ICA12, has been identified, which has a homology to the SOX family of transcription factors. The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence of ICA12 antibodies in diabetes mellitus patients and controls from Latvia and to see whether this antigen is important in revealing autoimmunity when antibodies against major antigens are not present. We studied 88 IDDM patients and 100 NIDDM patients as well as controls for the prevalence of GAD65, IA-2, and ICA12 antibodies by radioligand binding assay (RIA) using S-35-labeled islet antigens. We found ICA12Abs in 26 of 88 IDDM patients (30%) vs. 4% in healthy controls (4/100) and in 9 of 100 NIDDM patients (9%) vs. 2% controls (2/100). ICA12Abs alone are present in only 3% (3/88) of the patients with IDDM and 1% (1/100) of the NIDDM patients. We conclude that ICA12 represents the minor antigens in autoimmune diabetes and that, as a minor antigen, ICA12 alone does not contribute significantly in revealing new cases of autoimmunity.

Olanzapine did not contract the isolated guinea pig ileum, but blocked contractions induced by the 5-HT3 receptor agonist 2-methyl serotonin (2-CH3 5-HT) with a pK(B) value of 6.38 +/- 0.03, close to the affinity of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist ondansetron. The atypical antipsychotic risperidone (1 muM) did not significantly inhibit 2-CH3 5-HT-induced contractions. Olanzapine had high affinity (pK(i) = 8.30 +/- 00.06) for human 5-HT6 receptors in radioligand binding studies. Olanzapine did not stimulate [S-35]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTP gammaS) binding to the G protein G, in cells containing human 5-HT6 receptors, but inhibited 5-HT-stimulated [S-35]GTP gammaS binding (pK(B) = 7.38 +/- 0.16). Among other antipsychotics investigated, clozapine antagonized 5-HT6 receptors with a pK(B) = 7.42 +/- 0.15, ziprasidone was three-fold less potent, and risperidone, quetiapine and haloperidol were weak antagonists. Thus, olanzapine was not an agonist, but was a potent antagonist at 5-HT6 receptors and had marked antagonism at 5-HT3 receptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The basis of the central comorbidities in DMD is unclear. Brain dystrophin plays a role in the clustering of central gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors (GABA(A)Rs), and its loss in the mdx mouse alters the clustering of some synaptic subunits in central inhibitory synapses. However, the diversity of GABAergic alterations in this model is still fragmentary. In this study, the analysis of in vivo PET imaging of a benzodiazepine-binding site radioligand revealed that the global density of central GABA(A)Rs is unaffected in mdx compared with WT mice. In contrast, semi-quantitative immunoblots and immunofluorescence confocal imaging in tissue sections revealed complex and differential patterns of alterations of the expression levels and/or clustered distribution of a variety of synaptic and extrasynaptic GABA(A)R subunits in the hippocampus, cerebellum, cortex, and spinal cord. Hence, dystrophin loss not only affects the stabilization of synaptic GABA(A)Rs but also influences the subunit composition of GABA(A)Rs subtypes at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites. This study provides new molecular outcome measures and new routes to evaluate the impact of treatments aimed at compensating alterations of the nervous system in DMD.

Dasotraline [(1R,4 S)- 4-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-1-naphthalenamine, also known as SEP-225289) was evaluated for its inhibitory potency at DAT, NET and SERT using in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro radiometric functional uptake studies showed preferential inhibition by dasotraline of hDAT (IC50 =3 nM) and hNET (IC50 =4 nM relative to hSERT(IC50 =15 nM). In mouse ex vivo occupancy studies, dasotraline demonstrated total plasma concentration -dependent occupancy at DAT, NET and SERT. Determination of the TO50 (50% transporter occupancy) were 32, 109 and 276 ng/ml, respectively. In SPECT imaging studies in baboons, dasotraline (0.2 mg/kg iv) displaced radiotracer binding to DAT by 87% but only 20% at NET and SERT. Rat microdialysis studies were performed in prefrontal cortex and striatum. Dasotraline produced sustained (> 4 h) increases in dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations. Dasotraline was also more potent at increasing synaptic dopamine in the striatum, and norepinephrine in the prefrontal cortex than serotonin in these regions. In summary, dasotraline preferentially inhibits DAT and NET relative to SERT. Together, the occupancy and neurochemical profile of dasotraline provide a mechanistic basis for the treatment of diseases that have an underlying causality involving dopamine and norepinephrine dysfunction.

However, its exact role and underlying mechanism remain obscure. The current study found that aged apoE4-targeted replacement (TR) mice displayed obvious depression-like behavior when compared with age-matched apoE3-TR mice. Furthermore, apoE4 increased stress-induced depression-like behaviors, accompanied by declines in the hippocampal 5-HT (1A) radioligand [18F] MPPF uptake evidenced by positron emission tomography (PET). In [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose PET ([18F]-FDG PET) analyses, the FDG uptake in the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex and hippocampus of apoE4-TR mice significantly declined when compared with that of apoE3-TR mice after acute stress. Further biochemical analysis revealed that ATP levels in the prefrontal cortex of apoE4-TR mice decreased during aging or stress process and ATP supplementation effectively rescued the depression-like behaviors of elderly apoE4-TR mice. In primary cultured astrocytes from the cortex of apoE-TR mice, apoE4, when compared with apoE3, obviously decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial respiration, and glycolysis in a culture time-dependent manner. Our findings highlight that apoE4 is a potential risk factor of depression in elderly population by impairing the glucose metabolism, reducing ATP level, and damaging mitochondrial functions in astrocytes, which indicates that in clinical settings ATP supplementation may be effective for elderly depression patients with apoE4 carrier.

Modelling and Differential Quantification of Electric Cell-Substrate Impedance Sensing Growth Curves	SENSORS			English	Article						ECIS (impedance vs; time); IPEC-J2 (adherent cells); segmented regression; four-parameter logistic; smoothing spline; area under the curve (AUC)	UNDER-THE-CURVE; ETHANOL; POPULATION; PROLIFERATION; RADIOLIGAND; COMPETITION; RESOLUTION; APOPTOSIS; SELECTION; QPCR	Measurement of cell surface coverage has become a common technique for the assessment of growth behavior of cells. As an indirect measurement method, this can be accomplished by monitoring changes in electrode impedance, which constitutes the basis of electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS). ECIS typically yields growth curves where impedance is plotted against time, and changes in single cell growth behavior or cell proliferation can be displayed without significantly impacting cell physiology. To provide better comparability of ECIS curves in different experimental settings, we developed a large toolset of R scripts for their transformation and quantification. They allow importing growth curves generated by ECIS systems, edit, transform, graph and analyze them while delivering quantitative data extracted from reference points on the curve. Quantification is implemented through three different curve fit algorithms (smoothing spline, logistic model, segmented regression). From the obtained models, curve reference points such as the first derivative maximum, segmentation knots and area under the curve are then extracted. The scripts were tested for general applicability in real-life cell culture experiments on partly anonymized cell lines, a calibration setup with a cell dilution series of impedance versus seeded cell number and finally IPEC-J2 cells treated with 1% and 5% ethanol.

Pregnant rats were injected daily with 20 or 100mg/kg valproic acid (VPA) or saline from day 12 until the end of pregnancy. The number of pinning and pouncing events was assessed at postnatal days 29-34. Brains from male offspring (n=7/group) were removed at postnatal day 50. We performed quantitative autoradiography with an OXTR radioligand, the [I-125]-ornithine vasotocin analogue, in brain slices from the amygdala and other limbic brain regions involved in rat social behaviour. The results demonstrated a significant reduction in pinning behaviour and decreased OXTR density in the central nucleus of the amygdala in the 20mg/kg VPA group. However, the 100mg/kg VPA group had no significant changes in the number of play behaviour-related events or OXTR binding in the central nucleus of the amygdala. The reduction in OXTR density in the amygdala may be a critical disrupting mechanism affecting social behaviour in pervasive disorders such as ASD. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

New paradigms indicate that GPCRs localize to and signal at the nucleus, thus regulating distinct signaling cascades. The formylpeptide receptor FPR2 belongs to the GPCR super-family and is coupled to PTX-sensitive Gi proteins. We show by western blot analysis, immunofluorescence experiments and radioligand binding assays that FPR2 is expressed at nuclear level in CaLu-6 and AGS cells. Nuclear FPR2 is a functional receptor, since it participates in intra-nuclear signaling, as assessed by decreased G protein-FPR2 association and enhanced ERK2, c-Jun and c-Myc phosphorylation upon stimulation of intact nuclei with the FPR2 agonist, WKYMVm. We analyzed FPR2 sequence for the search of a nuclear localization sequence (NLS) and we found a stretch of basic aminoacids (227-KIHKK-231) in the third cytoplasmic loop of the receptor. We performed single (K230A) and multiple (H229A/K230A/K231A) mutagenesis of NLS. The constructs were individually overexpressed in HEK293 cells and immunofluorescence and western blot analysis showed that nuclear localization or translocation of FPR2 depends on the integrity of the H-229 and K-231 residues within the NLS.

We aim at improving the D-3 selectivity and hydrophilicity of a candidate ligand by changing the substitution pattern to a 2,3-dichlorophenylpiperazine and hydroxylation of the butyl chain. The compound [F-18]3 exhibited D-3 affinity of K-i =3.6 nM, increased subtype selectivity (K-i(D-2/D-3)=60), and low affinity to 5-HT1A and (1) receptors (K-i (5-HT1A/D-3) =34; K-i ((1)/D-3)=100). The two-step radiosynthesis was optimized for analog [F-18]4 by reducing the necessary concentration of the precursor amine (57mM), which reacted with [F-18]fluorophenylazocarboxylic tert-butylester under basic conditions. The optimization of the base (Cs 2CO3, 23mM) and the adjustment of reaction temperature led to the radiochemical yield of 63% after 5min at 35 degrees C. The optimized reaction conditions were transferred on to the synthesis of [F-18]3 with an overall non-decay corrected yield of 8-12% in a specific activity of 32-102 GBq/mu mol after a total synthesis time of 30-35min. This provides a D (3) radioligand candidate with improved attributes concerning selectivity and radiosynthesis for further preclinical studies.

Methods: Here, we applied small animal positron emission tomography (PET) and a radioligand for NK-1 receptors ([F-18]FE-SPA-RQ) for measuring occupancies of these receptors by a selective antagonist (aprepitant) in order to examine the validity of this in vivo imaging system for preclinical characterization of candidate agents acting on NK-1 receptors, and as a tool for predicting optimal doses in humans. Results: PET in gerbils depicted high uptake in the striatum and dose-dependent displacement with increasing doses of aprepitant. Occupancies increased as a function of aprepitant plasma concentrations according to a one-site competition model, which agrees with reported occupancy-concentration relationships in clinical studies after correction for species differences in plasma protein-unbound aprepitant fractions. These occupancy data were further supported by ex vivo autoradiography of brain samples from aprepitant-treated gerbils. In a pilot study of a marmoset, we obtained more accurate determinations of NK-1 receptor occupancy, less affected by spillover of signals from extracranial tissues than in gerbil experiments. Conclusions: These findings support the utility of small animals and quantitative PET in the development of drugs targeting NK-1 receptors.

SPECT is known as a more useful modality than PET in terms of routine diagnostic use, but there have been no reports on attractive probes in clinical studies. In this study, we synthesized and evaluated novel I-123-labeled pyridyl benzoxazole (PBOX) derivatives as SPECT probes for imaging A beta plaques in vivo. The PBOX derivatives showed affinity for A beta( 1-42) aggregates in vitro (K-i = 6.9-138 nM). In biodistibution experiments in normal mice, all these derivatives showed high initial uptake into (4.6-6.6% ID g(-1) at 2 min) and rapid clearance (0.3-1.3% ID g(-1) at 60 min) from the brain. Furthermore, [I-125]9 clearly labeled A beta plaques in in vitro autoradiography of postmortem AD brain sections. SPECT/CT study with [I-123]9 displayed higher radioactivity in Tg2576 mice than wild-type mice. In addition, ex vivo autoradiograms of brain sections from Tg2576 mice after the injection of [I-123]9 showed selective binding of Ab plaques. In conclusion, [I-123]9 may be a potential SPECT probe for imaging Ab plaques in AD brain.

An important impediment to the more rapid evaluation of interventions for both T1DM and T2DM lack of biomarkers of pancreatic BCM. A reliable means of monitoring the mass and/or function of beta-cells would enable evaluation of the progression of diabetes as well as the monitoring of pharmacologic and other interventions. Recently, we identified a biomarker of BCM that is quantifiable by positron emission tomography (PET). PET is an imaging technique which allows for non-invasive measurements of radioligand uptake and clearance, is sensitive in the pico- to nanonnolar range and of which the results can be deconvoluted into measurements of receptor concentration. For BCM estimates, we have identified VMAT2 (vesicular monoamine transporter type 2) as a biomarker and [C-11] DTBZ (dihydrotetrabenazine) as the transporter's ligand. VMAT2 is highly expressed in beta-cells of the human pancreas relative to other cells of the endocrine and exocrine pancreas. Thus measurements of [C-11] DTBZ in the pancreas provide an indirect measurement of BCM. Here we summarize our ongoing efforts to validate the clinical utility of this non-invasive approach to real-time BCM measurements	[Freeby, M.; Harris, P.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Goland, R.; Leibel, R.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Naomi Berrie Diabet Ctr, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Ichise, M.] Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, New York, NY 10032 USA; [Maffei, A.; Harris, P.] CNR, Inst Genet & Biophys Adriano Buzzati Traverso, I-80125 Naples, Italy	Columbia University; Columbia University; Columbia University; Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche (CNR); Istituto di Genetica e Biofisica "Adriano Buzzati-Traverso" (IGB-CNR)	Harris, P (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Med, 650 W 168th St,BB 20-06, New York, NY 10032 USA.

The effect of 1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl) isoquinoline on monoamine release and turnover in the rat frontal cortex	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						microdialysis; imidazoline(2)-binding site; monoamine release; BU98008 (1-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl) isoquinoline)	I-2-IMIDAZOLINE BINDING-SITES; IMIDAZOLINE I-2 RECEPTORS; OXIDASE-A; IN-VIVO; DOPAMINE; LIGANDS; BRAIN; 2-(2-BENZOFURANYL)-2-IMIDAZOLINE; INHIBITION	Imidazoline-2 binding sites (I-2-BS) are widely distributed in rat brain and our studies have shown that drugs selective for these sites regulate central extrasynaptic monoamine concentrations. Radioligand binding studies have recently shown that BU98008 (1-[4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl] isoquinoline) displays high affinity at I-2-binding sites. The aim of this study was set to assess the pharmacological actions of BU98008 in a functional in vivo model using the technique of in vivo brain microdialysis. Systemic injection of 20 mg/kg BU98008 produced an 85% rise in extracellular noradrenaline levels compared with basal values in the rat frontal cortex. Further experiments demonstrated that peripheral administration of 10 and 20 mg/kg BU98008 elicited a transient 25% elevation in dopamine overflow compared with basal values and simultaneously produced an 18% decrease in extracellular DOPAC (3-4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid) levels compared to basal values. In addition, BU98008 did not appear to affect serotonergic neurotransmission in the frontal cortex. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that BU98008 shares some functional similarities with known selective I-2-BS ligands. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The resultant GHR (GHM-656) includes a 36 amino-acids insertion after residue 207, in the region known to be important for homodimerization of GHR. We have examined the functional consequences of such an insertion in mammalian cells transfected with the wild type (GHRwt) and mutated GHR (GHM-656). Radioligand binding and flow cytometry analysis showed that GHR1-656 is poorly expressed at the cell surface compared with GHRwt. Total membrane binding and Western blot analysis showed no such difference in the level of total cellular GHR expressed for GHR1-656 vs GHRwt. Immunofluorescence showed GHR1-656 to have different cellular distribution to the wild type receptor (GHR-wt),,with the mutated GHR being mainly perinuclear and less vesicular than GHRwt. Western blot analysis showed GH-induced phosphorylation of jak2 and Stat5 for both GHR1-656 and GHRwt, although reduced Stat5- activity was detected with GHR1-656, consistent with lower levels of expression of GHR1-656 than GHRwt at the cell surface. In conclusion, we report that GHIS, due to a 36 amino-acids insertion in the extracellular domain of GHR, is likely to be explained by a trafficking defect rather than by a signalling defect of GHR.

G17DT is a gastrin immunogen, raising antibodies that blockade gastrin-stimulated growth. The aim of the study was to characterise antibody response and assess safety and tolerability of G17DT given to patients with gastric cancer. Experimental design. G17DT was administered to 52 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma at weeks 0, 2 and 6 by intramuscular injection at doses of 10, 100 and 250 mug. Antibody levels were measured by an ELISA assay. A radioligand displacement assay determined the ability of G17DT-immunised patients' sera to inhibit binding of (125)IG17 to cholecystokinin (CCK)-2 receptors. Results. By week 12 of the study, 6/12 evaluable stage I-III patients achieved an antibody response in the 10 mug group, 7/11 in the 100 mug group, and 11/12 in the 250 mug group. Stage IV patients dosed at 250 mug achieved a similar response rate to stage I-III patients dosed at 10 or 100 mug. G17DT was well tolerated in 47/52 patients. Two patients suffered significant adverse reactions including injection site pain and abscess. G17DT antibodies displaced iodinated gastrin from CCK-2 receptors, with the level of displacement correlating with antibody titre. Conclusions. G17DT immunisation is a well-tolerated method of raising functional antibodies to 17 amino acid gastrin forms in patients with gastric carcinomas. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Structural differences and varying affinities in radioligand binding studies lead to a further classification of alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-receptors into subtypes which are termed alpha(1A) (formerly alpha(1C)), alpha(1B), and alpha(1D) (formerly alpha(1AD)), and alpha(2AD), alpha(2B), and alpha(2C), respectively. mRNA expression of all but one alpha-adrenergic receptor subtypes and of all beta-adrenergic receptor types was measured quantitatively in total RNA extracted from mammary tissue of 10 lactating dairy cows by real-time reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction (PCR). mRNA expression of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors was highest for the alpha(1A)-subtype followed by alpha(1B), whereas the alpha(1D)-subtype could not be detected. The highest mRNA expression Of alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors was found for the alpha(2AD)-subtype, followed by alpha(2B) and alpha(2C). Within the beta-adrenergic receptors, the beta(2)-receptor type was most highly expressed, followed by beta(1) and beta(3) In conclusion, eight of nine adrenergic receptors classified to date were detected and relatively quantified in the mammary gland of dairy cows.

In the present study, we investigated whether [ I I C] KF 18446 PET can detect the change in the striatal adenosine A2A receptors in the rat after unilateral injection of an excitotoxin quinolinic acid into the striatum, a Huntington's disease model, to demonstrate the usefulness of [C-11]KF18446. The extent of the striatal lesion was identified based on MRI, to which the PET was co-registered. The binding potential of [C-11]KF18446 significantly decreased in the quinolinic acid-lesioned striatum. The decrease was comparable to the decrease in the potential of [(11C)]raclopride binding to dopamine D-2 receptors in the lesioned striatum, but seemed to be larger than the decrease in the potential of [C-11]SCH 23390 binding to dopamine D-1 receptors. Ex vivo and in vitro autoradiography validated the PET signals. We concluded that (C-11]KF18446 PET can detect change in the adenosine A(2A) receptors in the rat model, and will provide a new diagnostic tool for characterizing post-synaptic striatopallidal neurons in the stratum.

The drugs' direct vascular effects were assessed as the rightward shift (dose ratio - 1) of angiotensin dose-effect curves on diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Renal and adrenal effects were assessed by plasma renin activity (PRA), aldosterone concentrations, and antagonistic concentration equivalents (n x K-i) in a radioligand rat lung receptor assay. Both drugs exerted similar substantial (> 30-fold) and long-lasting (> 2-fold 47 h after dosing) rightward shifts of the angiotensin II dose effect declining with half-lives of 15 h irbesartan and 12 h candesartan, respectively. Dose ratio - 1 versus n x K-i showed a linear relationship in Schild regression plots; both drugs increased PRA, decreased DBP, and suppressed aldosterone. The slopes of linear relationship between angiotensin antagonism (dose ratio - 1) and PRA increase were almost threefold steeper (p = 0.005) following irbesartan as compared with candesartan. The findings suggest that for the same degree of angiotensin II antagonism, irbesartan produces a greater increase in PRA than candesartan. These pharmacodynamic differences warrant further investigation and clarification.

Specific GHB binding sites, uptake system, synthetic and metabolizing enzymes have been identified in CNS. The present study shows the anatomical distribution of GHB binding sites in sections of primate (squirrel monkey) and human brain by radioligand quantitative autoradiography. In both species the highest densities of binding sites were found in the hippocampus, high to moderate densities in cortical areas (frontal, temporal, insular, cingulate and entorhinal) and low densities in the striatum; no binding sites were detected in the cerebellum. High density of GHB binding was found in the monkey amygdala. In addition the binding characteristics of [H-3]GHB to membrane preparations of human brain cortex were examined. Scatchard analysis and saturation curves revealed both a high (K-d1 92+/-4.4 nM; B-max1 1027+/-110 fmol/mg protein) and a low-affinity binding site (K-d2 916+/-42 nM; B-max2 8770+/-159 fmol/mg protein). The present study is the first report on the autoradiographic distribution of specific GHB binding sites in the primate and human brain: such distribution is in both species in good agreement with the distribution found in the rat brain.

However, the high therapeutic activity can interfere with the PET camera performance and degrade both image quality and quantitative capabilities. As a solution, low-energy photon emissions from the therapeutic radionuclide can be highly attenuated, still allowing sufficient detection of annihilation photons in coincidence. Methods: Hollow Rose metal cylinders with walls 2-4 mm thick were used to shield a Na-22 point source and a uniform phantom filled with F-18 as they were imaged on a preclinical PET camera with increasing activities of Lu-177. A mouse with a subcutaneous tumor was injected with F-18-FDG and imaged with an additional 120 MBq of Lu-177 and repeated with shields surrounding the animal. Results: The addition of Lu-177 to the volume imaged continuously degraded the image quality with increasing activity. The image quality was improved when shielding was introduced. The shields showed a high ability to produce stable and reproducible results for both spatial resolution and quantification of up to 120 MBq of Lu-177 activity (maximum activity tested). Conclusion: Without shielding, the activity quantification will be inaccurate for time points at which therapeutic activities are high. The suggested method shows that the shields reduce the noise induced by the Lu-177 and therefore enable longitudinal quantitative intratherapeutic imaging studies.

We carried out mutagenesis studies of the human GPR139 receptor to identify the critical structural motifs required for GPR139 activation. We applied site-directed and high throughput random mutagenesis approaches using a double addition normalization strategy to identify novel GPR139 sequences coding receptors that have altered sensitivity to endogenous ligands. This approach resulted in GPR139 clones with gain-of-function, reductionof-function or loss-of-function mutations. The agonist pharmacology of these mutant receptors was characterized and compared to wild-type receptor using calcium mobilization, radioligand binding, and protein expression assays. The structure-activity data were incorporated into a homology model which highlights that many of the gain-of-function mutations are either in or immediately adjacent to the purported orthosteric ligand binding site, whereas the loss-of-function mutations were largely in the intracellular G-protein binding area or were disrupters of the helix integrity. There were also some reduction-of-function mutations in the orthosteric ligand binding site. These findings may not only facilitate the rational design of novel agonists and antagonists of GPR139, but also may guide the design of transgenic animal models to study the physiological function of GPR139.

The major aim of the current study was to identify and investigate the properties of the binding target for D-deprenyl in synovial membrane explants from arthritic patients. Main methods: Thirty patients diagnosed with arthritis or osteoarthritis were enrolled into the study. Homologous and competitive radioligand binding assays utilizing [H-3]D-deprenyl were performed to investigate the biochemical characteristics of the binding site and assess differences in the binding profile in synovial membranes exhibiting varying levels of inflammation. Key findings: The [H-3]D-deprenyl binding assay confirmed the existence of a single, saturable population of membrane-bound protein binding sites in synovial membrane homogenates. The macroscopically determined level of inflammation correlated with an increase in [H-3]D-deprenyl binding affinity, without significant alterations in binding site density. Selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, selegiline competed for the same site as [H-3]D-deprenyl, but failed to differentiate the samples with regard to their inflammation grade. A monoamine oxidase A inhibitor, pirlindole mesylate showed only weak displacement of [H-3]D-deprenyl binding. No significant alterations in monoamine oxidase B expression was detected, thus it was not confirmed whether it could serve as a marker for ongoing inflammation.

Previously, we investigated its effects in an invitro model expressing human MOP and NOP receptors individually or simultaneously (MOP, NOP, and MOP+NOP) in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Here, we expanded this cell model by expressing human KOP, MOP and NOP receptors individually or simultaneously (KOP, KOP+MOP, KOP+NOP and KOP+MOP+NOP). Radioligand binding with tritium-labelled diprenorphine confirmed the expression of KOP receptors. Immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry indicated that the expressed KOP, MOP and NOP receptors are N-linked glycoproteins and colocalized in cytoplasmic compartments. Acute application of the opioid receptor agonists U-69593, DAMGO and nociceptin inhibited adenylate cyclase (AC) activity in cells expressing KOP, MOP and NOP receptors respectively. Buprenorphine, when applied acutely, inhibited AC activity to 90% in cells expressing KOP+MOP+NOP receptors. Chronic exposure to buprenorphine induced concentration-dependent AC superactivation in cells expressing KOP+NOP receptors, and the level of this superactivation was even higher in KOP+MOP+NOP-expressing cells. Our study demonstrated that MOP receptor could enhance AC regulation in the presence of coexpressed KOP and NOP receptors, and NOP receptor is essential for concentration-dependent AC superactivation elicited by chronic buprenorphine exposure.

Hydrophilic [H-3]-NMS and hydrophobic [H-3]-QNB bound to the detrusor muscle segments with the same density, suggesting that the muscarinic receptors were localized at the plasma membrane. While the density of muscarinic receptor was higher in detrusor muscle than in the bladder mucosa and prostate, there was no species-specific difference either in density or in subtype distribution (M-1, M-2, and M-3 subtypes in detrusor; M-2 and M-3 subtypes in bladder mucosa; and M-1 and M-2 subtypes in prostate). Incubation of detrusor strips with carbachol decreased [(3) H]-NMS binding sites within 20 min, followed by a reduction of [(3) H]-QNB binding sites after a 60-min lag phase. The loss of the binding sites over 3 h after carbachol treatment was the same (approximately 40%) for both radioligands. The present intact tissue segment binding assay reveals tissue-specific and plasma membrane distribution of distinct muscarinic receptor subtypes and their dynamic changes (internalization and down-regulation) in lower urinary tract of humans and rats.

Serum anticholinergic activity in patients following cardiac surgery and healthy individuals following amitriptyline application	METHODS AND FINDINGS IN EXPERIMENTAL AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						antimuscarinergic activity; cognitive dysfunction; dementia; radioligand assay; serum protein	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; DELIRIUM; ASSOCIATION; DYSFUNCTION	The serum anticholinergic activity (SAA) is used as a marker for cognitive impairment. Here, two studies have been performed characterizing the SAA profile. In Study 1 the endogenous SAA in relation to the total serum protein concentration was monitored for 24 h in five healthy individuals and compared with that in four inpatients following cardiac surgery. In Study 2 the SAA of seven healthy individuals was assessed following a single amitripyline dose. In both studies SAA was assessed by an ex vivo assay. In Study 1, the absolute SAA varied in a wide range of 1.2 and 14.5 atropine equivalents (AEs) over 24 h. A circadian pattern was not observed. The mean total serum protein concentration, but not the SAA, was significantly lower in inpatients than in healthy, individuals. In Study 2, the SAA increased following amitriptyline to a maximum. The mean SAA increased by 6.39 AE at the amitriptyline peak concentration. High SAA variability showed a low, statistical relation to amitriptyline concentrations. Both studies characterize the SAA as an individual parameter not affected per se by surgery or clinical care and poorly correlated with the total serum protein concentration. The relation with amitripryline concentration helps to quantily SAA values towards a better understanding of the clinical implications and limitations of SAA changes. (c) 2007 Prous Science.

This study tested the hypothesis that activation of a G(i) protein is necessary for MIS-mediated OM in spotted seatrout. Addition of MIS significantly decreased adenylyl cyclase activity in a steroid specific, pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manner in oocyte membranes and microinjection of PTX into oocytes inhibited MIS-induced OM, suggesting the steroid activates a Gi protein. MIS significantly increased [S-35]GTP gamma S binding to ovarian membranes, confirming that MIS receptor binding activates a G-protein, and immunoprecipitation studies showed the increased [S-35]GTP gamma S binding was associated with G alpha(i1-3) proteins. Radioligand binding studies in ovarian membranes using GTP gamma S and PTX demonstrated that the MIS binds a receptor coupled to a PTX-sensitive G-protein. This study provides the first direct evidence in a vertebrate model that MIS-induced activation of a Gi protein is necessary for OM. These results support a mechanism of MIS action involving binding to a novel, G-protein coupled receptor and activation of an inhibitory G-protein, the most comprehensive and plausible model of MIS initiation of OM proposed to date.

The tachykinin substance P (SP) represents the prototypic spinal excitatory peptide neurotransmitter/neuromodulator, acting in concert with endogenous opioid systems to regulate analgesic responses to nociceptive stimuli. We have synthesized and pharmacologically characterized a chimeric peptide containing overlapping NH2- and COOH-terminal functional domains of the endogenous opioid endomorphin-2 (EM-2) and the tachykinin SP, respectively. Repeated administration of the chimeric molecule YPFFGLM-NH2, designated ESP7, into the rat spinal cord produces opioid-dependent analgesia without loss of potency over 5 days. In contrast, repeated administration of ESP7 with concurrent SP receptor (SPR) blockade results in a progressive loss of analgesic potency, consistent with the development of tolerance. Furthermore, tolerant animals completely regain opioid sensitivity after post hoc administration of ESP7 alone, suggesting that coactivation of SPRs is essential to maintaining opioid responsiveness. Radioligand binding and signaling assays, using recombinant receptors, confirm that ESP7 can coactivate mu-opioid receptors (MOR) and SPRs in vitro. We hypothesize that coincidental activation of the MOR- and SPR-expressing systems in the spinal cord mimics an ongoing state of reciprocal excitation and inhibition, which is normally encountered in nociceptive processing. Due to the ability of ESP7 to interact with both MOR and SPRs, it represents a unique prototypic, anti-tolerance-forming analgesic with future therapeutic potential.

ImmunoPET Predicts Response to Met-targeted Radioligand Therapy in Models of Pancreatic Cancer Resistant to Met Kinase Inhibitors	THERANOSTICS			English	Article						ImmunoPET; pancreatic cancer; molecular imaging	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; C-MET; IMMUNOREACTIVE FRACTION; PET; EXPRESSION; ANTIGEN; BIODISTRIBUTION; OVEREXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION	Background: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has limited standard of care therapeutic options. While initially received with enthusiasm, results from targeted therapy with small molecule tyrosine kinases inhibitors (TKIs) have been mixed, in part due to poor patient selection and compensatory changes in signaling networks upon blockade of one or more kinase of tumors. Here, we demonstrate that in PDACs otherwise resistant to rational kinase inhibition, Met-directed immuno-positron emission tomography (immunoPET) can identify targets for cell-signaling independent targeted radioligand therapy (RLT). In this study, we use Met-directed immunoPET and RLT in models of human pancreatic cancer that are resistant to Met- and MEK-selective TKIs, despite over-expression of Met and KRAS-pathway activation. Methods: We assessed cell membrane Met levels in human patient samples and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cell lines (BxPC3, Capan2, Suit2, and MIA PaCa-2) using immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and cell-surface biotinylation assays. To determine whether Met expression levels correlate with sensitivity to Met inhibition by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), we performed cell viability studies. A Met-directed imaging agent was engineered by labeling Met-specific onartuzumab with zirconium-89 (Zr-89) and its in vivo performance was evaluated in subcutaneous and orthotopic PDAC xenograft models. To assess whether the immunoPET agent would predict for targeted RLT response, onartuzumab was then labeled with lutetium (Lu-177) as the therapeutic radionuclide to generate our [Lu-177]Lu-DTPA-onartuzumab RLT agent. [Lu-177]Lu-DTPA-onartuzumab was administered at 9.25MBq (250 mu Ci)/20 mu g in three fractions separated by three days in mice subcutaneously engrafted with BxPC3 (high cell-membrane Met) or MIA PaCa-2 (low cell-membrane Met). Primary endpoints were tumor response and overall survival. Results: Flow cytometry and cell-surface biotinylation studies showed that cell-membrane Met was significantly more abundant in BxPC3, Capan2, and Suit2 when compared with MIA PaCa-2 pancreatic tumor cells. Crizotinib and cabozantinib, TKIs with known activity against Met and other kinases, decreased PDAC cell line viability in vitro. The TKI with the lowest IC50 for Met, capmatinib, had no activity in PDAC lines. No additive effect was detected on cell viability when Met-inhibition was combined with MEK1/2 inhibition. We observed selective tumor uptake of [Zr-89]Zr-DFO-onartuzumab in mice subcutaneously and orthotopically engrafted with PDAC lines containing high cell-surface levels of Met (BxPC3, Capan2, Suit2), but not in mice engrafted with low cell-surface levels of Met (MIA PaCa-2). Significant tumor growth delay and overall survival benefit were observed in both BxPC3 and MIA PaCa-2 engrafted animals treated with RLT when compared to controls, however, the benefit was more pronounced and more durable in the BxPC3 engrafted animals treated with [Lu-177]Lu-DTPA-onartuzumab RLT. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that while over-expression of Met is not predictive of Met-directed TKI response, immunoPET can detect Met over-expression in vivo and predicts for therapeutic response to Met-selective RLT. This phenomenon can be exploited for other Met-overexpressing tumor types specifically, and to any differentially overexpressed surface molecule more broadly.

SAP has been observed to be elevated in patients with depression, and higher SAP levels are associated with better response to the antidepressant escitalopram. The mechanisms underlying these clinical observations remain unclear. We examined the effect of SAP on serotonin transporter (SERT) expression and localization using Western blot, confocal microscopy, and positron emission tomography with the radioligand [C-11]DASB. We also investigated the effect of SAP on treatment response to escitalopram in mice with the forced swim test (FST), a classical behaviour paradigm to assess antidepressant effects. SAP reduced [C-11]DASB binding as an index of SERT levels, consistent with Western blots showing decreased total SAP protein because of increased protein degradation. In conjunction with the global decrease in SERT levels, SAP also promotes VAMP-2 mediated SERT membrane insertion. SAP levels are correlated with behavioural despair and SSRI treatment response in mice with FST. In MDD patients, the SAP and membrane SERT levels are correlated with response to SSRI treatment. SAP has complex effects on SERT levels and localization, thereby modulating the effect of SSRIs, which could partially explain clinical variability in antidepressant treatment response. These results add to our understanding of the mechanism for antidepressant drug action, and with further work could be of clinical utility.

We synthesized bis-cyclic guanidine heterocyclic peptidomimetics from reduced tripeptides. In vitro screening with radioligand competition binding assays demonstrated variable affinity for the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), delta-opioid receptor (DOR), and kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) across the series, with compound 1968-22 displaying good affinity for all three receptors. Central intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 1968-22 produced dose-dependent, opioid receptor-mediated antinociception in the mouse 55 degrees C warm-water tail-withdrawal assay, and 1968-22 also produced significant antinociception up to 80 min after oral administration (10 mg/kg, p.o.). Compound 1968-22 was detected in the brain 5 min after intravenous administration and was shown to be stable in the blood for at least 30 min. Central administration of 1968-22 did not produce significant respiratory depression, locomotor effects or conditioned place preference or aversion. The data suggest these bis-cyclic guanidine heterocyclic peptidomimetics with multifunctional opioid receptor activity may hold potential as new analgesics with fewer liabilities of use.

Theranostics in Nuclear Medicine: Emerging and Re-emerging Integrated Imaging and Therapies in the Era of Precision Oncology	RADIOGRAPHICS			English	Article							RECEPTOR RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; NEUROENDOCRINE TUMORS; THYROID-CANCER; FDG PET; DOSIMETRY; RADIOIODINE; GUIDELINES; SURVIVAL	Theranostics refers to the pairing of diagnostic biomarkers with therapeutic agents that share a specific target in diseased cells or tissues. Nuclear medicine, particularly with regard to applications in oncology, is currently one of the greatest components of the theranostic concept in clinical and research scenarios. Theranostics in nuclear medicine, or nuclear theranostics, refers to the use of radioactive compounds to image biologic phenomena by means of expression of specific disease targets such as cell surface receptors or membrane transporters, and then to use specifically designed agents to deliver ionizing radiation to the tissues that express these targets. The nuclear theranostic approach has sparked increasing interest and gained importance in parallel to the growth in molecular imaging and personalized medicine, helping to provide customized management for various diseases; improving patient selection, prediction of response and toxicity, and determination of prognosis; and avoiding futile and costly diagnostic examinations and treatment of many diseases. The authors provide an overview of theranostic approaches in nuclear medicine, starting with a review of the main concepts and unique features of nuclear theranostics and aided by a retrospective discussion of the progress of theranostic agents since early applications, with illustrative cases emphasizing the imaging features. Advanced concepts regarding the role of fluorine 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET in theranostics, as well as developments in and future directions of theranostics, are discussed.

Nowadays, new specific receptor targeted PET tracers in prostate cancer imaging have been introduced; one of the most used is Ga-68-PSMA, that evaluates the expression of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). This tracer has been rapidly taken into account for its better sensitivity and specificity compared to lipid metabolism tracers, such as C-11/F-18 labelled fluorocholine. Besides, in the era of theranostics, this tracer is having a useful application not only for imaging but also for therapeutic purposes. The aim of this review article is, in the first part, to give an overview of the main indications and future development of Ga-68-PSMA imaging, using PET/CT or PET/MRI, according to the clinical course of the disease and in view of the current use of multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and choline PET in the management of PCa. In the second part, a brief overview of the promising F-18-labelled PSMA tracers and the current use of PSMA radionuclide therapy will be provided.

Our previous studies revealed that hypidone hydrochloride (YL-0919), a novel 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist and SSRI, has antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects. Here, further studies found that YL-0919, but not vilazodone (a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist and SSRI), exerted a significant memory-enhancing effect in the Morris water maze, object recognition test and step-down passive avoidance task. Because the 5-HT6 receptor has emerged as an interesting drug target to improve cognition, we investigated the target profile of YL-0919 using radioligand binding assays [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding and cAMP stimulation assays. YL-0919 was found to act as a highly effective, full agonist of 5-HT6 receptors. Finally, we observed that the memory-enhancing activities of YL-0919 were completely reversed after co-administration of SB271046 (a selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist) at a dose that does not alter cognition. In summary, the findings of the current study suggest that YL-0919 has clear memory-enhancing effects, which might be at least partially mediated by 5-HT6 receptor activation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We recently reported three new potent and selective carbon-11 labeled VAChT radiotracers. Herein, we report the resolution with a Chiralcel OD column of three additional fluorine containing VAChT ligands in which a fluoroethoxy or fluoroethylamino moiety was substituted for the methoxy group. An in vitro competitive binding assay showed that (-)-7 had high potency for VAChT (Ki-VAChT = 0.31 +/- 0.03 nM) and excellent selectivity for VAChT versus sigma receptors (Ki-sigma 1 = 1870 +/- 250 nM, Ki-sigma 2 = 5480 +/- 140 nM). Three different radiolabeling approaches were explored; the radiosynthesis of (-)-[F-18]7 was successfully accomplished via a stepwise two-pot, three-step method with moderate yield (11 +/- 2%) and high radiochemical purity (>98%). PET imaging studies in a nonhuman primate indicated that (-)-[F-18]7 rapidly entered the brain and accumulated in the VAChT-enriched striatum. The uptake of (-)-[F-18]7 in the target striatal area peaked at 10 min and displayed improved clearance kinetics compared to the VAChT tracer [F-18] VAT, which has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for first-in-man studies. These studies justify further investigation of (-)-[F-18]7 and exploration of the structure-activity relationships of these fluoroethoxy and fluoroethylamino analogs.

Enteric bacteria circumvent the gastric acid barrier by activating extreme acid-resistance responses, such as the arginine-dependent acid resistance system. In this response, L-arginine is decarboxylated to agmatine, thereby consuming one proton from the cytoplasm. In Escherichia coli, the L-arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC facilitates the export of agmatine in exchange of L-arginine, thus providing substrates for further removal of protons from the cytoplasm and balancing the intracellular pH. We have solved the crystal structures of wild-type AdiC in the presence and absence of the substrate agmatine at 2.6-angstrom and 2.2-angstrom resolution, respectively. The high-resolution structures made possible the identification of crucial water molecules in the substrate-binding sites, unveiling their functional roles for agmatine release and structure stabilization, which was further corroborated by molecular dynamics simulations. Structural analysis combined with site-directed mutagenesis and the scintillation proximity radioligand binding assay improved our understanding of substrate binding and specificity of the wild-type L-arginine/agmatine antiporter AdiC. Finally, we present a potential mechanism for conformational changes of the AdiC transport cycle involved in the release of agmatine into the periplasmic space of E. coli.

Investigation of the presence and antinociceptive function of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the African naked mole-rat (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>)	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY A-NEUROETHOLOGY SENSORY NEURAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Naked mole-rat; Cholinergic receptors; Muscarinic; antinociception; formalin test	SPINAL DORSAL-HORN; GABA(B) RECEPTORS; OPIOID RECEPTORS; FORMALIN TEST; CHRONIC PAIN; HOT-PLATE; LOCALIZATION; HYPERALGESIA; ANALGESICS; MORPHINE	The present study investigated the cholinergic system in the African naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber) with focus on the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes M-1 and M-4. The protein sequences for the subtypes m (1-5) of the naked mole-rat were compared to that of the house mouse (Mus musculus) using basic local alignment search tool (BLAST). The presence and function of M-1 and M-4 was investigated in vivo, using the formalin test with the muscarinic receptor agonists xanomeline and VU0152100. Spinal cord tissue from the naked mole-rat was used for receptor saturation binding studies with [H-3]-N-methylscopolamine. The BLAST test revealed 95 % protein sequence homology showing the naked mole-rat to have the genetic potential to express all five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes. A significant reduction in pain behavior was demonstrated after administration of 8.4 mg/kg in the formalin test. Administration of 50 mg/kg VU0152100 resulted in a non-significant tendency towards antinociception. The antinociceptive effects were reversed by the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist atropine. Binding studies indicated presence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors with a radioligand affinity comparable to that reported in mice. In conclusion, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes are present in the naked mole-rat and contribute to antinociception in the naked mole-rat.

F-18-RGD-A7R was prepared by conjugation with F-18-SFB. The final product was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography and tested in vitro and in vivo. Cell-binding assays of RGD-A7R, RGD and RGD-A7R, A7R were tested in U87MG cells (I-125-RGDyK and I-125-A7RY as radioligand, respectively). Preliminary biodistribution of the F-18-RGD-A7R was also evaluated. The RGD-A7R had good integrin binding affinity (50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)=21.67 and 23.68nM, slightly lower than unmodified RGD (40.02nM) and A7R (50.18nM)). The radiotracer had receptor-mediated activity accumulation in U87MG tumor (1.90 +/- 0.34 percentage of injected dose per gram (%ID/g) at 0.5h postinjection), which is known to be integrin positive. After blocking with RGD-A7R, the tumor uptake was reduced to 0.47 +/- 0.06 %ID/g at 0.5h postinjection. F-18-RGD-A7R exhibited dual receptor targeting properties both in vitro and in vivo. The favorable characterizations of F-18-RGD-A7RY, such as convenient synthesis, high specific activity, and high tumor uptake, warrant its further investigation for clinical cancer imaging.

Part of its mechanism of survival is a 50% decrease in muscarinic and nicotinic receptors and a 50% decrease in adrenoceptor levels. Hypothesis: The hypothesis was tested that the dopaminergic neuronal system had also adapted. Methods: Radioligand binding assays measured dopamine receptor level and binding affinity in the striatum. Immunohistochemistry of brain sections with specific antibodies visualized dopamine transporter. Effects on the intracellular compartment were measured as CAMP content, PI-phospholipase C activity. Results: Dopamine receptor levels were decreased 28-fold for the D-1-like, and more than 37-fold for the D-2-like receptors, though binding affinity was normal. Despite these huge changes in receptor levels. dopamine transporter levels were not affected. The intracellular compartment had normal levels of CAMP and PI-phospholipase C activity. Conclusion: Survival of the acetylcholinesterase knock-out mouse could be linked to adaptation of many neuronal systems during development including the cholinergic. adrenergic and dopaminergic. These adaptations balance the overstimulation of cholinergic receptors caused by high acetylcholine concentrations and thus maintain homeostasis inside the cell, allowing the animal to live.

Effects of chlorpyrifos oxon on M2 muscarinic receptor internalization in different cell types	JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES			English	Article							ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; METHYL PARATHION; DOWN-REGULATION; IN-VIVO; DESENSITIZATION; PHOSPHORYLATION; SEQUESTRATION; MODULATION; BINDING; CHOLINESTERASE	The muscarinic M2 receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Agonist activation of GPCR leads to their phosphorylation, desensitization, internalization, and subsequent endocytic recycling or lysosomal degradation. Agonist-induced phosphorylation of M2 receptors is mediated by G-protein receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). The active metabolite of the organophosphorus insecticide chlorpyrifos, i.e., chlorpyrifos oxon (CPO), inhibited agonist-induced phosphorylation of human recombinant M2 receptors by GRK2 in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. In both intact HEL 299 cells (human embryonic lung fibroblasts expressing M2 receptors) and CHO-M2 cells (stably expressing M2 receptors), the muscarinic agonist carbachol (100 mu M) led to receptor internalization as determined by reduced specific binding to the membrane-impermeable radioligand [H-3]-N-methylscopolamine (NMS). CPO alone (100 mM) exerted no significant effect on NMS binding in either HEL 299 or CHO-M2 cells. In HEL 299 cells, CPO did not influence carbachol-induced internalization, whereas in CHO-M2 cells CPO blocked internalization. In primary striatal neurons, M2 receptors appeared widely and diffusely distributed. Exposure to either carbachol or CPO led to apparent receptor internalization with an increased percent of cells exhibiting punctate domains of immunostaining, while combined exposure to both carbachol and CPO led to a significantly higher percent of cells exhibiting this appearance. The data suggest that CPO may differentially influence agonist-stimulated M2 receptor internalization in a cell-dependent manner.	[Zamora, Elmar M.

Thomas; Roy, Kunal			Exploring QSAR of peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding affinity of 2-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl-acetamides using topological and physicochemical descriptors	INDIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY SECTION B-ORGANIC CHEMISTRY INCLUDING MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						QSAR study; peripheral benzodiazepine; receptor; 2-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine	LIGANDS; SITE; RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; ACETAMIDES; PARAMETERS; TARGET; BRAIN; MODEL	The structural and physicochemical requirements of 2-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl-acetamides for binding with peripheral benzodiazepine receptor has been explored in the present QSAR Study. The calculated hydrophobicity, logP(calc), shows a parabolic relation with the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor binding affinity, which suggests that the binding affinity increases with increase in the partition coefficient of the compounds until it reaches the critical value after which the affinity decreases. The range of the optimum values of logP(calc) is between 5.423-5.819 as found from different equations. The width of the para substituents at R-3 Position is conducive for the binding affinity. The E-state values of the fragments like methyl, [GRAPHICS] are conducive for the bindin,g affinity, while E-state value of the fragment -F is detrimental to the binding affinity. The average distance sum of the connectivity (Balaban J) among different groups is also conducive for the binding affinity. The presence of methyl groups at R-1 and R-2 positions and the presence of substituents at R-5 position are detrimental to the binding affinity, while presence of substituents at R-3 position and the presence of methyl group at R-6 position are conducive to the binding affinity.

J	Yao, Y; Koo, JCP; Wells, JW; Hampson, DR				Yao, Y; Koo, JCP; Wells, JW; Hampson, DR			Expression of a truncated secreted form of the mGluR3 subtype of metabotropic glutamate receptor	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						G-protein coupled receptor; DCG-IV; mGlu3; family 3	LIGAND-BINDING; TERMINAL DOMAIN; PURIFICATION; ANTAGONIST	In this study, 10 truncated constructs encompassing all or part of the extracellular ligand binding domain of the mGluR3 subtype of metabotropic glutamate receptor were generated, expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and tested for secretion and binding of the high affinity agonist [H-3]DCG-IV. The effect of inserting epitope tags into the N or C termini on cell secretion and radioligand binding was also examined. Secretion into the cell culture media was observed for 8 of the 10 truncated receptors and all secreted forms displayed high affinity agonist binding. The highest level of binding was observed in the C-terminal polyhistidine-tagged receptor truncated at serine 507. Reduction and enzymatic deglycosylation of the serine 507 truncated receptor using endoglycosidase H and PNGase F showed that the secreted receptor was a disulfide-linked dimer containing complex oligosaccharides. Pharmacological characterization demonstrated that the truncated receptor showed the same rank order of potency of agonist binding, a relatively small 2-fold decrease in agonist affinity, and a larger 10-fold decrease in affinity for the antagonist LY341495 compared to the full-length membrane-bound receptor. These results define the essential requirements for ligand binding to the extracellular domain of mGluR3 and highlight parameters important for the optimization of receptor expression in mammalian cells.

Icatibant and [Lys(10)]-Icatibant maintained the same high affinity towards the three receptors. For Icatibant-NH2, [Ala(10)]-Icatibant, MEN 11270 and [Glu(10)]-MEN 11270, the changes in affinity at the WT and Ser(111)Lys receptors indicated that the presence of a net positive or negative charge at the C-terminal moiety of these peptides caused a decrease in affinity to the WT receptor and that Ser(111) residue is in proximity of the side chain of residue 10. The changes in affinity measured with [desArg(10)]-Icatibant and [desArg(10)]-Icatibant-NH2, moreover, confirmed that a C-terminal charge compensation between the positive charge of Arg(10) side chain and the C-terminal free carboxylic function favours a high affinity interaction.

These new ligands contain groups amenable to labeling with C-11 or PET, or I-123 for SPECT. In vitro analysis of these compounds revealed that placement of a methoxy group at either the ortho or para position of the phenylaminocarbonyl group significantly reduced receptor affinity (Ki = 74.0 +/- 8.1 and 26.5 +/- 4.9 nM, respectively), as did placement of an iodine at the para position (Ki = 60.4 +/- 8.2 nM). However, the meta-methoxy derivative (4b) maintained high affinity (Ki = 4.8 +/- 0.9 nM) for the glycine site and was therefore labeled with carbon-11 by reacting the corresponding desmethyl derivative with [C-11]methyl iodide. Radiochemical yields of 14 +/- 10% (EOS), and high specific activity (1.2 +/- 0.5 Ci/mumol (EOS, n= 7)) were realized, and the product was prepared in a sterile saline solution suitable for in vivo use.

Recently, enfortumab vedotin (EV) was approved by the FDA as the first nectin-4 targeting antibody-drug conjugate for treating advanced urothelial carcinoma (UC). A PET imaging method to non-invasively quantify nectin-4 expression level would potentially help to select patients most likely to respond to EV and predict the response. Experimental Design: In this study, we designed a bicyclic peptide-based nectin-4 targeting radiotracer Ga-68-N188. Initially, we performed preclinical evaluations of Ga-68-N188 in UC cell lines and xenograft mouse models. Next, we performed the translational study in healthy volunteers and a pilot cohort of patients with advanced UC on uEXPLORER total-body PET/CT. Results: In the preclinical study, Ga-68-N188 showed high affinity to nectin-4, specific uptake in a nectin-4(+) xenograft mouse model, and suitable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. In the transla-tional study, 2 healthy volunteers and 14 patients with advanced UC were enrolled. The pharmacokinetic profile was determined for Ga-68-N188, and the nectin-4 relative expression level in different organs was quantitatively imaged. Conclusions: A clear correlation between PET SUV value and nectin-4 expression was observed, supporting the application of Ga-68-N188 PET as a companion diagnostic tool for optimizing treatments that target nectin-4.

Understanding of the mGluR2 function is pivotal in supporting the drug discovery targeting mGluR2. Herein, the positive allosteric modulation of mGluR2 was investigated via the in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using 2-((4-(2-[C-11]methoxy-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)piperidin-1-yl)methyl)-1-methyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine ([C-11]mG2P001). Distinct from the orthosteric compounds, pretreatment with the unlabeled mG2P001, a potent mGluR2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM), resulted in a significant increase instead of decrease of the [C-11]mG2P001 accumulation in rat brain detected by PET imaging. Subsequent in vitro studies with [H-3]mG2P001 revealed the cooperative binding mechanism of mG2P001 with glutamate and its pharmacological effect that contributed to the enhanced binding of [H-3]mG2P001 in transfected CHO cells expressing mGluR2. The in vivo PET imaging and quantitative analysis of [C-11]mG2P001 in non-human primates (NHPs) further validated the characteristics of [C-11]mG2P001 as an imaging ligand for mGluR2. Self-blocking studies in primates enhanced accumulation of [C-11]mG2P001. Altogether, these studies show that [C-11]mG2P001 is a sensitive biomarker for mGluR2 expression and the binding is affected by the tissue glutamate concentration.

Currently, the gold standard for imaging demyelination is MRI, but despite its high spatial resolution and sensitivity to demyelinated lesions, it remains challenging to obtain specific and quantitative measures of molecular changes involved in demyelination. To understand the contribution of demyelination in different diseases and to assess the efficacy of myelin-repair therapies, it is critical to develop new in vivo imaging tools sensitive to changes induced by demyelination. Upon demyelination, axonal K+ channels, normally located underneath the myelin sheath, become exposed and increase in expression, causing impaired conduction. Here, we investigate the properties of the K+ channel PET tracer [F-18]3F4AP in primates and its sensitivity to a focal brain injury that occurred three years prior to imaging. [F-18]3F4AP exhibited favorable properties for brain imaging including high brain penetration, high metabolic stability, high plasma availability, high reproducibility, high specificity, and fast kinetics.

However, the exact mechanism of PSMA inhibitor internalization has not yet been studied, and the inhibitors' subcellular fate remains elusive. Here, we investigated the intracellular distribution of peptidomimetic PSMA inhibitors and of PSMA itself by stimulated emission depletion (STED) nanoscopy, applying a novel nonstandard live cell staining protocol. Imaging analysis confirmed PSMA cluster formation at the cell surface of prostate cancer cells and clathrin-dependent endocytosis of PSMA inhibitors. Following the endosomal pathway, PSMA inhibitors accumulated in prostate cancer cells at clinically relevant time points. In contrast with PSMA itself, PSMA inhibitors were found to eventually distribute homogeneously in the cytoplasm, a molecular condition that promises benefits for treatment as cytoplasmic and in particular perinuclear enrichment of the radionuclide carriers may better facilitate the radiation-mediated damage of cancerous cells. This study is the first to reveal the subcellular fate of PSMA/PSMA inhibitor complexes at the nanoscale and aims to inspire the development of new approaches in the field of prostate cancer research, diagnostics, and therapeutics. 19). Significance: This study uses STED fluorescence microscopy to reveal the subcellular fate ofPSMA/PSMA inhibitor complexes near the molecular level, providing insights of great clinical interest and suggestive of advantageous targeted therapies.

Association of norepinephrine transporter methylation with in vivo NET expression and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms in ADHD measured with PET	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article								Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common neurodevelopmental disorder with a robust genetic influence. The norepinephrine transporter (NET) is of particular interest as it is one of the main targets in treatment of the disorder. As ADHD is a complex and polygenetic condition, the possible regulation by epigenetic processes has received increased attention. We sought to determine possible differences in NET promoter DNA methylation between patients with ADHD and healthy controls. DNA methylation levels in the promoter region of the NET were determined in 23 adult patients with ADHD and 23 healthy controls. A subgroup of 18 patients with ADHD and 18 healthy controls underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 to quantify the NET in several brain areas in vivo. Analyses revealed significant differences in NET methylation levels at several cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites between groups. A defined segment of the NET promoter ("region 1") was hypermethylated in patients in comparison with controls. In ADHD patients, a negative correlation between methylation of a CpG site in this region and NET distribution in the thalamus, locus coeruleus, and the raphe nuclei was detected. Furthermore, methylation of several sites in region 1 was negatively associated with the severity of hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms. Our results point to an epigenetic dysregulation in ADHD, possibly due to a compensatory mechanisms or additional factors involved in transcriptional processing.	[Sigurdardottir, H. L.; Kranz, G.

The mu opioid receptor gene, OPRM1, undergoes extensive alternative splicing, generating multiple splice variants. One type of splice variants are truncated variants containing only six transmembrane domains (6TM) that mediate the analgesic action of novel opioid drugs such as 3 '-iodobenzoylnaltrexamide (IBNtxA). Previously, we have shown that IBNtxA is a potent analgesic effective in a spectrum of pain models but lacks many side-effects associated with traditional opiates. In order to investigate the targets labeled by IBNtxA, we synthesized two arylazido analogs of IBNtxA that allow photolabeling of mouse mu opioid receptors (mMOR-1) in transfected cell lines and mMOR-1 protein complexes that may comprise the 6TM sites in mouse brain. We demonstrate that both allyl and alkyne arylazido derivatives of IBNtxA efficiently radio-photolabeled mMOR-1 in cell lines and MOR-1 protein complexes expressed either exogenously or endogenously, as well as found in mouse brain. In future, design and application of such radio-photolabeling ligands with a conjugated handle will provide useful tools for further isolating or purifying MOR-1 to investigate site specific ligand-protein contacts and its signaling complexes.

Dextromethorphan (DM) is a widely used antitussive reported to exert anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. In this study, we examined the long-term effect of MDMA on the primate serotonergic system and the protective property of DM against MDMA-induced serotonergic abnormality using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nine monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were divided into three groups, namely control, MDMA and co-treatment (MDMA/DM). [I-123]-ADAM was used as the radioligand for serotonin transporters (SERT) in SPECT scans. SERT levels of the brain were evaluated and presented as the uptake ratios (URs) of [I-123]-ADAM in several regions of interest of the brain including midbrain, thalamus and striatum. We found that the URs of [I-123]-ADAM were significantly lower in the brains of MDMA than control group, indicating lower brain SERT levels in the MDMA-treated monkeys. This MDMA-induced decrease in brain SERT levels could persist for over four years. However, the loss of brain SERT levels was not observed in co-treatment group. These results suggest that DM may exert a protective effect against MDMA-induced serotonergic toxicity in the brains of the non-human primate.

Nonetheless, the exact mode of action of major phytocannabinoids has to be elucidated, but both, receptor and non-receptor mediated effects are discussed. Focusing on the often presumed structure-affinity-relationship, Ki values of phytocannabinoids cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabichromene (CBC), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN), THC acid (THCA) and THC to human CB1 and CB2 receptors were detected by using competitive inhibition between radioligand [H-3]CP-55,940 and the phytocannabinoids. The resulting Ki values to CB1 range from 23.5 mu M (THCA) to 14,711 mu M (CBDV), whereas Ki values to CB2 range from 8.5 JAM (THCA) to 574.2 mu M (CBDV). To study the relationship between binding affinity and effects on neurons, we investigated possible CB1 related cytotoxic properties in murine mesencephalic primary cell cultures and N18TG2 neuroblastoma cell line. Most of the phytocannabinoids did not affect the number of dopaminergic neurons in primary cultures, whereas propidium iodide and resazurin formation assays revealed cytotoxic properties of CBN, CBDV and CBG. However, THC showed positive effects on N18TG2 cell viability at a concentration of 10 mu M, whereas CBC and THCA also displayed slightly positive activities. These findings are neither linked to structural characteristics nor to the receptor binding affinity therewith pointing to another mechanism than a receptor mediated one. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In cAMP accumulation assays, both 5'-substituted NECA and C2-substituted MRS3997 are full agonists. However, only 5'-substituted adenosine analogs are full agonists in calcium mobilization, ERK1/2 phosphorylation and P-arrestin translocation. A(2B)AR overexpression in HEK293 cells markedly increased the agonist potency and maximum effect in cAMP accumulation, but less in calcium and ERK1/2. A(2B)AR siRNA silencing was more effective in reducing the maximum cAMP effect of non-nucleoside agonist BAY60-6583 than NECA's. A quantitative 'operational model' characterized C2-substituted MRS3997 as either balanced (cAMP accumulation, ERK1/2) or strongly biased agonist (against calcium, beta-arrestin). N-6-substitution biased against ERK1/2 (weakly) and calcium and beta-arrestin (strongly) pathways. BAY60-6583 is ERK1/2-biased, suggesting a mechanism distinct from adenosine derivatives. BAY60-6583, as A(2B)AR antagonist in MIN-6 mouse pancreatic beta cells expressing low A(2B)AR levels, induced insulin release. This is the first relatively systematic study of structure-efficacy relationships of this emerging drug target. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Synthesis and in Vitro Characterization of Radioiodinatable Benzodiazepines Selective for Type 1 and Type 2 Cholecystokinin Receptors	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							B-GASTRIN RECEPTORS; PEPTIDE RECEPTORS; QUANTITATIVE AUTORADIOGRAPHY; ANTAGONISTS; TUMORS; LIGANDS; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; DIAGNOSIS; BINDING	Radiolabeled antagonists of specific peptide receptors identify a higher number of receptor binding sites than agonists and may thus be preferable for in vivo tumor targeting. In this study, two novel radioiodinated 1,4-benzodiazepines, (S)-1-(3-iodophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin3-yl)urea (9) and (R)-1-(3-iodophenyl)-3-(1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo(e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl)urea (7), were developed. They were characterized in vitro as high affinity selective antagonists at cholecystokinin types 1 and 2 (CCK1 and CCK2) receptors using receptor binding, calcium mobilization, and internalization studies. Their binding to human tumor tissues was assessed with in vitro receptor autoradiography and compared with an established peptidic CCK agonist radioligand. The I-125-labeled CCK1 receptor-selective compound 9 often revealed a substantially higher amount of CCK1 receptor binding sites in tumors than the agonist I-125-CCK. Conversely, the radioiodinated CCK2 receptor-selective compound 7 showed generally weaker tumor binding than I-125-CCK. In conclusion, compound 9 is an excellent radioiodinated nonpeptidic antagonist ligand for direct and selective labeling of CCK1 receptors in vitro. Moreover, it represents a suitable candidate to test antagonist binding to CCK1 receptor-expressing tumors in vivo.

Despite the fact that rat striatum contains high level of both dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors, only the D-1-specific AC activation by agonists could be determined. All D-1-receptor agonists (dopamine, dihydrexidine, and A 77636) used were able to increase cAMP accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner, while D-1-receptor antagonists (SCH23390, SKF83566, and butaclamol) blocked the effects induced by the aforementioned agonists. At the same time, the D-2-receptor agonist quinpirole and antagonist sulpiride had no effect on cAMP accumulation in striatal homogenate neither on the basal level nor on the activated level of AC, while inhibited [H-3]raclopride binding to these membranes. Comparing the ligands of the D-1 receptor in modulating the activity of AC and displacing D-1-receptor-specific radioligand [H-3]SCH23390 binding revealed that the ligands modulate both of these processes with similar affinities. It indicates that under given experimental conditions, only dopamine D-1-receptor-mediated stimulation of AC activity can be measured in membrane homogenate of rat striatum, while dopamine D-2-receptor effects remain fully hidden.

This positron-emission tomography (PET) study tested the hypothesis that 5-HT1A auto receptor internalization might be indexed in vivo by a decrease in the specific binding of the 5-HT1A radioligand, 4-[18F]fluoro-N-[2-[1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1 piperazinyl]ethyl-N-2-pyridinyl-benzamide ([F-18]MPPF), in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) of healthy adult men administered a single oral dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine. Methods: [F-18]MPPF binding potential was measured in the DRN and other brain regions endowed with 5-HT1A receptors in eight healthy volunteers, 5 hours after the randomized, double-blind administration of fluoxetine (20 mg) or placebo. Results: In every subject, [F-18]MPPF binding potential was decreased in the DRN only (44% +/- 22 SD), in response to fluoxetine. Conclusions: Imaging the functional state of 5-HT1A autoreceptors (i.e., internalization) in the human brain, using [F-18]MPPF/PET, may represent a promising avenue for investigating the neurobiology of serotonin-related disorders and notably of major depression.

The affinities of 16-29 for 5-HT7, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and D-2 receptors were assessed by radioligand binding assays. The intrinsic activities at the 5-HT7 receptor of the most potent compounds were determined. A series of substituents covering a wide range of electronic, steric, and polar properties was evaluated, revealing a key role on 5-HT7 receptor affinity and intrinsic activity. Certain lipophilic substituents (SCH3, CH(CH3)(2), N(CH3)(2), CH3, Ph) led to high-affinity agonists, whereas OH and NHCH3 substituents switched intrinsic activity toward antagonism. 4-[2-(1-Methylethyl)phenyl]-N-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-1-piperazinehexanamide (19), 4-(2-diphenyl)-N-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-1-piperazinehexanamide (21), and 4-(2-dimethylaminophenyl)-N-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-yl)-1-piperazinehexanamide (22) were identified as potent 5-HT7 receptor agonists (K-i = 0.13-1.1 nM, EC50 = 0.90-1.77 mu M), showing selectivity over 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and D-2 receptors.

[H-3] LBT-999 (> 99% radiochemically pure, specific radioactivity of 3.1 TBq/mmol) was prepared from [H-3]methyl iodide, allowing its in vitro pharmacological evaluation (K-D: 9 nM for DAT and IC50 > 1000 nM for SERT and NET). Routine production batches of 4.5-9.0 GBq of iv injectable solutions of [C-11]LBT-999 (with specific radioactivities ranging from 30 to 45 GBq/mu mol) were prepared in 25-30 min (HPLC purification and formulation included) using the efficient methylation reagent [C-11]methyl triflate. The preliminary in vivo pharmacological evaluation of [C-11]LBT-999, using both biodistributions in rats and brain imaging in monkeys with positron emission tomography (PET), clearly illustrates that this ligand is all excellent candidate for quantification with PET of DAT in humans.

Multistep synthesis starting from 5-nitroindole, via the Gould-Jacobs reaction to the quinoline nucleus, yielded key intermediates 9-chloro-3H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]quinoline-8-carboxylates. The reaction of the latter with methyl-hydrazine and various phenyl-hydrazines furnished the final compounds. In order to confirm the expected tetracyclic 2-substituted-2H-pyrazolopyrroloquinolin-3-one structure, IR spectrophotometric, mono-H-1 and C-13 and bi-dimensional spectrometric and HRMS analyses were carried out: all compounds were found to be 2-substituted 3-keto tautomers; compound 6 only differed because it turned out to be 1-methyl-2H-pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyrrolo[3,2-f]quinolin-3-olo. The results of this work are consistent with those previously reported for PQs: 7-9 show high potency in displacing specific [H-3]flunitrazepam from its receptor site; no compound was active in inhibiting the binding of [H-3]PK 11195.

Hence, inhibition of mucin secretion from these cells may be clinically beneficial. In this study, we have developed a lectin-based assay for mucin secretion from ovine airway goblet cells and used this assay to investigate the regulation of these cells by endothelin (ET)-1. ET-1 inhibited baseline mucin secretion (maximum inhibition: 60.3 +/- 4.2%, 50% inhibitory concentration: 0.8 +/- 0.17 nM). This response was abolished by the ETA antagonist, BQ-123 (1 PM), but not by the ETB antagonist, BQ-788 (1 muM). ET-1 (1 muM) did not affect mucin secretion stimulated by ATP (100 muM) but secretion in response to ATP (10 BM) was inhibited by 63.3 +/- 11.8%. This response could be eliminated by BQ-123, but not by BQ-788. Radioligand binding and immunohistochemistry indicated the expression of both ETA-and ETB-receptors on the epithelium. In summary, ET-1, acting via ETA-receptors, inhibits baseline and ATP-stimulated mucin secretion from ovine airway goblet cells. This represents the first report of a physiologic mechanism for inhibiting airway goblet cell mucin secretion; an understanding of this mechanism may provide opportunities for the treatment of obstructive airways disease.

In this study, the authors simultaneously assessed the effects of two antipsychotic drugs on procedural learning and on striatal dopamine (D-2) receptor occupancy. Twenty-seven patients receiving either olanzapine or haloperidol as antipsychotic medication were assessed with the Computed Visual Tracking Task (CVTT) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) following the administration of Iodine (123)-IBZM (I-123-IBZM), a radioligand with a high affinity and specificity for the D-2 receptors. The results showed poorer procedural learning in the haloperidol-treated patients than in normal control subjects, while no difference could be found between olanzapine-treated patients and normal control subjects. In the haloperidol but not the olanzapine group, significant correlations were found between procedural learning deficits and striatal D-2 receptor occupancy. However, there was no significant difference in D-2 receptor occupancy between olanzapine- and haloperidol-treated patients, and this may be related to the high doses of olanzapine and low doses of haloperidol administered. The authors concluded that: 1) striatal D-2 receptor blockade may alter procedural learning in humans; and 2) olanzapine may have a protective effect on procedural learning, even at doses that produce striatal D-2 receptor occupancy as high as that found with haloperidol. This protective effect of olanzapine may be related to its atypical pharmacological properties.

J	Cho, YJ; Lee, KE				Cho, YJ; Lee, KE			Decreased glucocorticoid binding affinity to glucocorticoid receptor is important in the poor response to steroid therapy of older-aged patients with severe bronchial asthma	ALLERGY AND ASTHMA PROCEEDINGS			English	Article							RESISTANT ASTHMA; EXPRESSION; INTERLEUKIN-4; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; MONOCYTES	The aim of this study was to determine whether alterations in glucocorticoid (GC) to GC receptor (GC/GCR) binding affinity and the state of airway remodeling contribute to the poor response to GC therapy of severe bronchial asthma patients in old age. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from two groups with severe asthma, 10 patients with steroid resistant (SR), 7 patients with steroid sensitive (SS), and 6 normal controls. GC/GCR binding affinity for dexamethasone was determined by using a radioligand binding assay with Scatchard analysis, and bronchial wall thickness in high-resolution computed tomography was used to determine the degree of airway remodeling. SR patients had decreased GC/GCR binding affinity (K-d=24.3+/-9.55; p<0.05) compared with the SS patients (K-d=13.5 +/- 1.48; p<0.05) and the normal controls (K-d=4.24+/-1.09). The inner diameter of bronchi and the thickness of the bronchial wall of segmental and subsegmental bronchi were increased significantly in patients compared with normal controls. However, no significant differences were found between the SR and SS patients. Our results suggest that decreased GC/GCR binding affinity, may be an important factor of clinical GC resistance in the acute exacerbation of chronic severe asthma in older-aged bronchial asthma patients.

We studied the influence of the two intramembranal Cys residues at positions 304 and 348, the role of Arg at position 177 in the highly conserved tripeptide sequence Asp-Arg-Tyr, the cytosolic G-protein binding area, and attempted to verify the general hypothesis of an ion tunnel-like interface in GPCRs. Wild type receptor, Histagged receptor, and His-tagged mutant receptors were expressed in COS-7 cells and functionally compared by bradykinin-induced formation of inositolphosphate and arachidonic acid. To investigate the expression, all mutants were modified at the N-terminus by insertion of two successive His-tags and detected with an anti-poly-His antibody. Replacement of the second and third cytosolic loop by a loop from another membrane protein as well as single replacement of Arg at position 177 by Ala leads to a fully inactive receptor mutant without any ligand binding affinity and stimulatory activity. Mutants with replacement of Cys residues 304 and 348 by Ser showed only moderate effects. Regardless of the replacement of Asp 407 by Ala, the receptor is able to increase the agonist-induced levels of inositolphosphate and of arachidonic acid, indicating that our studies can not verify the postulated ion tunnel hypothesis.

In this study, we found novel 1,2,4-triazolo[5,1-i]purine derivatives (2) showing human adenosine A(3) receptor affinities. The compounds were obtained in two steps from 5-amino-4-cyanoimidazole (33). The affinity was determined in radioligand binding assays for the cloned human adenosine A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) receptors. After the structure-activity relationship was analyzed, We determined that there was a mild parabolic relationship between the length of alkyl groups at the 5-position and the affinities at the A(3) receptor and positive correlation between the length of the substituents on phenyl groups at the 8-position and the affinities at the A(2A) receptor. These investigations led to potent and selective human adenosine A3 receptor ligands. The most potent A(3) receptor ligand (5-n-butyl-8-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3H-[1,2,4]triazolo-[5,1-i]purine (27, K-i = 0.18 nM) and the most selective A(3) receptor ligand against A(1), A(2A), and A(2B) receptors, (5-n-butyl-8-(4-n-propoxyphenyl)-3H-[1,2,4]triazolo[5,1-i]purine (29, > 19 600), were discovered.

Metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (KP), the main metabolism route of tryptophan, can influence the function of brain innate immune cells. Objective: To investigate whether tryptophan metabolites in blood associate with TSPO-PET measurable microglial activation in MS brain. Methods: Microglial activation was detected using PET imaging and the TSPO-binding radioligand [11C]PK11195. Distribution volume ratios (DVR) for specific [11C]PK11195-binding in the normal appearing white matter (NAWM), lesions, and thalamus were calculated. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure serum levels of tryptophan and kynurenine pathway metabolites. Results: The study cohort consisted of 48 MS patients. Increased DVR in the NAWM and thalamus correlated with decreased serum 3-hydroxykynurenine level (R =-0.31, p = 0.031 and R =-0.32, p = 0.028). Increased EDSS correlated with decreased 3-hydroxykynurenine and xanthurenic acid (R =-0.36, p = 0.012 and R =-0.31, p = 0.034) and increased DVR in the NAWM and thalamus (R = 0.33, p = 0.023 and R = 0.34, p = 0.020, respectively). Conclusions: This clinical study demonstrates an association between low serum 3-hydroxykynurenine and high microglial activation in MS. Further investigations are warranted for elucidation of the biological mechanisms behind this association.

This "upregulation" is thought to be a contributing factor to tobacco dependence. Although cigarette smoke contains thousands of constituents that can contribute to nicotine dependence, it is not well understood whether non -nicotine constituents contribute to nAChR upregulation. In this study, we used an aqueous cigarette smoke extract (CSE), which contains nicotine and soluble constituents of cigarette smoke, to induce nAChR upregulation in adult and adolescent rats. To do this, male rats were exposed to nicotine or CSE (1.5 mg/kg/day nicotine equivalent, intravenously) daily for ten days. This experimental procedure produces equivalent levels of brain and plasma nicotine in nicotineand CSE-treated animals. We then assessed nAChR upregulation using quantitative autoradiography to measure changes in three nAChR types. Adolescents were found to have consistently greater alpha 4132 nAChR binding than adults in many brain regions. Chronic nicotine exposure did not significantly increase nAChR binding in any brain region at either age. Chronic CSE exposure selectively increased alpha 4132 nAChR binding in adolescent medial amygdala and alpha 7 binding in adolescent central amygdala and lateral hypothalamus. CSE also increased alpha 3134 nAChR binding in the medial habenula and interpeduncular nucleus, and alpha 7 binding in the medial amygdala, independent of age. Overall, this work provides evidence that cigarette smoke constituents influence nAChR upregulation in an age-, nAChR typeand region-dependent manner.

Methods PET image analysis was carried out using whole-body segmentation quantifying molecular tumour volume (SUV > 3 threshold for PSMA, SUV > liver+2sd for fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) including SUVmax and SUVmean. For baseline bone scans, EXINI bone scan index (BSI) was used to calculate the percentage of involved bone. Baseline alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), prostate specific antigen (PSA) and PSA doubling time were also used in this analysis. We used univariate cox regression analysis and log-rank comparison with optimised cut-offs to find suitable biomarkers prognostic of overall survival from time of enrolment. Results This analysis identified FDG-positive tumour volume (FDGvol; HR 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4-4.8), mean intensity of PSMA-avid tumour uptake (PSMAmean; HR 0.89; 95% CI, 0.8-0.98), bone scan index (BSI; HR 2.3; 95% CI, 1.2-4.4), ALP (HR 1.1; 95% CI, 1-1.2) and LDH (HR 1.2; 95% CI, 1-1.5) as biomarkers prognostic of overall survival. Conclusions In addition to established biomarkers, both FDG and PSMA PET/CT parameters have prognostic significance for survival in men undergoing LuPSMA therapy.

To investigate this, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of autoantibodies against parathyroid autoantigens, calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and NACHT leucine-rich-repeat protein 5 (NALP5), in a large group of patients with non-APS1 polyendocrine autoimmunity. Possible occult APS1 was investigated by cytokine autoantibody measurement and AIRE gene analysis. Design, Subjects and MeasurementsSubjects were 178 patients with APS2, 3 or 4, and 80 healthy blood donors. Autoantibodies against the CaSR, NALP5 and cytokines were measured by immunoprecipitation, radioligand binding assays or ELISA, respectively. ResultsFour patient samples (2.2%), but none of the controls, were positive for CaSR autoantibodies. NALP5 autoantibodies were not detected in any participant. Eleven patients (6.2%) had cytokine autoantibodies, but none of the control samples was positive. None of the patients with cytokine autoantibodies had any known or novel mutations in the AIRE gene. ConclusionsThe low prevalence of CaSR autoantibodies indicate a very low level of subclinical parathyroid autoimmunity in APS types 2, 3 and 4. In addition, autoantibodies against cytokines constitute an uncommon feature of non-APS1 polyglandular autoimmunity.	[Kemp, E.

Ingestion of sweets releases dopamine in stria turn, and both sweet preferences and striatal D-2 receptors (D2R) decline with age and may be altered in obesity. Understanding the relationships between these variables and the impact of obesity on these relationships may reveal insight into the neurobiological basis of sweet preferences. We evaluated sucrose preferences, perception of sweetness intensity, and striatal D2R binding potential (D2R BPND) using positron emission tomography with a D2R-selective radioligand insensitive to endogenous dopamine, (N-[C-11] methyl)benperidol, in 20 subjects without obesity (BMI 22.5 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2); age 28.3 +/- 5.4 years) and 24 subjects with obesity (BMI 40.3 +/- 5.0 kg/m(2); age 31.2 +/- 6.3 years). The groups had similar sucrose preferences, sweetness intensity perception, striatal D2R BPND, and age-related D2R BPND declines. However, both striatal D2R BPND and age correlated with sucrose preferences in subjects without obesity, explaining 52% of their variance in sucrose preference. In contrast, these associations were absent in the obese group. In conclusion, the age-related decline in D2R was not linked to the age-related decline in sweetness preferences, suggesting that other, as-yet-unknown mechanisms play a role and that these mechanisms are disrupted in obesity.

Pharmacological activity and metabolic stability of the series was assessed. Consistent with earlier studies of beta-amino acid substitution into endomorphins, multiple analogues incorporation AHPBA displayed high affinity for it and opioid receptors (MOR and DOR, respectively) in radioligand competition binding assays, and an increased stability in rat brain membrane homogenates, notably Dmt-Tic-(2R,3S) AHPBA-Phe-NH2 (compound 26). Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 26 produced anti-nociception (ED50 value (and 95% confidence interval) = 1.98 (0.79-4.15) nmol, i.c.v.) in the mouse 55 degrees C warm-water tail-withdrawal assay, equivalent to morphine (235 (1.13-5.03) nmol, i.c.v.), but demonstrated DOR-selective antagonism in addition to non-selective opioid agonism. The antinociception of 26 was without locomotor activity or acute antinociceptive tolerance. This novel class of peptides adds to the potentially therapeutically relevant collection of previously reported EM analogues. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Here, we used the N-methyl-pyrrolidine moiety of nicotine to design and synthesise novel alpha 4 beta 2-preferring neonicotinic ligands. We increased the distance between the basic nitrogen and aromatic group of nicotine by introducing an ester functionality that also mimics acetylcholine (Fig. 2). Additionally, we introduced a benzyloxy group linked to the benzoyl moiety. Although the neonicotinic compounds fully inhibited binding of both [alpha-I-125]bungarotoxin to human alpha 7 nAChRs and [H-3]cytisine to human alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs, they were markedly more potent at displacing radioligand binding to human alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs than to alpha 7 nAChRs. Functional assays showed that the neonicotinic compounds behave as antagonists at alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 4 beta 2 alpha 5 nAChRs. Substitutions on the aromatic ring of the compounds produced compounds that displayed marked selectivity for alpha 4 beta 2 or alpha 4 beta 2 alpha 5 nAChRs. Docking of the compounds on homology models of the agonist binding site at the alpha 4/beta 2 subunit interfaces of alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs suggested the compounds inhibit function of this nAChR type by binding the agonist binding site.

Comparatively little is known about adult age changes regarding D1 receptors. In this study, we demonstrate marked age-related D1 receptor losses in striatal, limbic, and cortical areas using positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]SCH23390 in humans. Interregional correlations of binding potential (BP) values were high for areas within DA pathways in younger and elderly adults alike. Furthermore, interregional correlations in D1 BP between DA pathways were uniformly high in younger adults, indicating that D1 receptor densities in striatal, limbic, and cortical areas are not regulated independently, despite dopaminergic innervation from different midbrain areas. For elderly adults, between-pathway correlations of D1 receptor densities were preserved only between mesolimbic and mesocortical areas, whereas striatal BPs were weakly related to those in limbic and neocortical regions. Importantly, weak between-pathway correlations in elderly adults were found only for the slower half of the sample when BP was estimated during a cognitive interference task. These results suggest that D1 receptor densities in different pathways are not regulated independently in younger adults, but segregate in older age, and that this segregation of D1 receptor systems may be related to age-related cognitive slowing.

The aim of this work was to establish whether beta(2)-adrenoceptors were involved in polyamine-relaxation of bovine tracheal strips. Endogenous polyamines displaced the specific radioligand, [H-3]dihydroalprenolol, but spermine was the mast-potent. The polyamines elicited an acute transient relaxation, which was independent of beta-adrenoceptor activation, followed by a maintained component, which was shown to be dependent on beta-adrenoceptor activation because it was antagonized and reversed by propranolol. Polyamines did not alter salbutamol-induced acute relaxation. Polyamines modified the salbutamol-induced long-term effect on airway tone, which was shown by a partial reversal of beta-adrenoceptor desensitization. This process was delayed by alpha-difluoromethylomithine, but spermine increased the latency and time of reversal and decreased receptor desensitization. Putrescine prolonged the time-constant without changes in the desensitization. Spermine, but not putrescine, might block Calf channels, because it relaxed KCl- or electrical stimulated-contractions, which are related to Ca2+ influx, and the inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase activity. These differences might explain the functional differences observed between putrescine and spermine. Therefore, polyamines may modulate airway smooth muscle tone and interfere with the mechanism of receptor desensitization via several mechanisms involving beta(2)-adrenoceptors, Ca2+ influx and cAMP phosphodiesterase.

The Y-maze avoidance task showed that oral administration of smilagenin significantly improved spatial memory performance in aged rats. Mechanistic studies showed that smilagenin was neither a ligand of the M receptors nor a cholinesterase inhibitor, while radioligand binding assays revealed that smilagenin significantly increased the M1-receptor density. The increase of M-1-receptor density correlated with memory improvement. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that the m1 mRNA in m1 gene-transfected CHO cells increased significantly, and the average half-life of m1 mRNA was approximately doubled by smilagenin treatment. These results suggest that smilagenin improves memory of aged rats at least partially by increasing the stability of m1 mRNA. However since the ChAT activity in the cortex of aged rats was also elevated by smilagenin, it cannot be excluded that the increase of intrinsic acetylcholine excretion also plays a role in the memory-improvement effect of smilagenin.

The corresponding radiolabeled compounds [F-18]8 [F-18]12, [F-18]15, and [F-18]18 were prepared from their p-toluenesulfonyl precursors in 50-85% radiochemical yield. In biodistribution studies in rats, the distribution of radioactivity of the [F-18]PBR compounds paralleled the known localization of PBRs. In the olfactory bulbs, where the uptake of radioactivity was higher than in the rest of the brain, PK11195 and Ro 5-4864 were able to significantly inhibit [F-18]12, while little or no pharmacological action of these established PBR drugs were observed on the uptake of [F-18]8, [F-18]15, and [F-18]18 compared to control animals. Hence, [F-18]12 appeared to be the best candidate for evaluation as an imaging agent for PBR expression in neurodegenerative disorders.	[Fookes, Christopher J.

Longitudinal changes in epitope recognition of autoantibodies against glutamate decarboxylase 65 (GAD65Ab) in prediabetic adults developing diabetes	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						autoantibody epitopes; autoimmune; GAD65Ab; LADA	GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; INSULIN REQUIREMENT; ANTIBODY EPITOPE; DEPENDENT ONSET; MELLITUS; DIAGNOSIS; PREDICTION; ISOFORM; DISEASE; PATIENT	We analysed the beta cell-specific autoimmunity reflected in autoantibodies to the smaller isoform of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD65Ab) in the prediabetic period of GAD65Ab-positive healthy adults who developed Type 2 diabetes (T2D) during a follow-up period of 10 years. We found that of the adults that tested GAD65Ab-positive at baseline (n = 25), six developed T2D and one developed Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of the subjects that tested GAD65Ab-negative at baseline (n = 2209), 81 developed T2D, one developed T1D and four developed unclassified diabetes, indicating that the risk for GAD65Ab-positive healthy adults to develop diabetes is increased sixfold. The GAD65Ab epitopes were characterized in a competition radioligand binding assay using recombinant Fab derived of GAD65-specific monoclonal antibodies. We observed that the GAD65Ab epitope specificities in the prediabetic period changed dynamically. Specifically, the binding to a middle and a C-terminal epitope increased during the follow-up period (P = 0.03), causing a significant increase in the number of epitopes recognized (P = 0.03). These findings are similar to previous observations of dynamic changes in the prediabetic period of schoolchildren at high risk for T1D development. However, the character of the epitopes differs between the two populations, suggesting differences in the beta cell-specific autoimmune response in the prediabetic period of patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) and T1D.

J	Huang, XY				Huang, XY			Equilibrium competition binding assay: inhibition mechanism from a single dose response	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						equilibrium binding; competition binding; inhibition mechanism; receptor binding; displacement	NMDA RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; THERAPEUTIC AGENTS; SITE	Inhibition of a receptor by a small-molecule compound in many cases is achieved via a competitive, uncompetitive or noncompetitive mechanism. The receptor inhibitor interaction is often probed through the displacement of a ligand in an equilibrium competition binding experiment. The previous solutions to receptor inhibition mechanisms were borrowed from steady-state enzyme inhibition mechanisms. The inhibition mechanism is determined by a visual inspection or a global fit of ligand dose response curves at a series of inhibitor concentrations. However these solutions only apply to situations when both the ligand and the inhibitor are not significantly depleted by the receptor. In most published equilibrium receptor binding studies, only the relative potency of the inhibitor is calculated. Ranking inhibitors tested under differing experimental conditions is often not possible. In the current paper, we offer exact mathematical solutions to uncompetitive and non-competitive inhibition, and demonstrate that in most cases both the inhibition mechanism and absolute potency of an inhibitor can be simultaneously determined from a single dose response of the inhibitor at a fixed concentration of the ligand. Therefore, an equilibrium competition assay provides a quick and facile method to determine the inhibition mechanism of a large number of inhibitors. The theory herein described is applicable to equilibrium competition binding experiments such as radioligand assays and fluorescence polarization assays. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The location(s) of Hsp47 binding sites on the collagen molecule are, as yet, unknown. We have examined the substrate specificity of Hsp47 in vitro using well-characterized CNBr peptide fragments of type I and type II Collagen along with radiolabeled, recombinant Hsp47. Interaction of these peptides with Hsp47 bound to collagen-coated microtiter wells showed several binding sites for Hsp47 along the length of the alpha1 and alpha2 chains of type I Collagen and the alpha1 chain of type II collagen, with the N-terminal regions showing the strongest affinities. The latter observation was also supported by the results of a ligand-blot assay. Except for two peptides in the alpha2(I) chain, peptides that showed substantial binding to Hsp47 did so in their triple-helical and not random-coil form. Unlike earlier studies that used peptide models for Collagen, the results obtained here on fragments of type I and type II collagen identify, for the first time, binding of Hsp47 to specific regions of the collagen molecule. They also point to additional structural requirements for Hsp47 binding besides the known preference for third-position Arg residues and the triple-helical conformation.

We describe here the biological evaluation of [F-18]FMe-McN in rats. Biodistribution studies of [F-18]FMe-McN in rat brain ex vivo after an intravenous injection showed a high accumulation of radioactivity in the regions rich in SERT, such as raphe nuclei, hypothalamus, thalamus, substantia nigra, locus coeruleus, and amygdala. Region-to-cerebellum ratios reached a maximum value of 9 in raphe nuclei within 3.5 h after administration. The specificity and selectivity of [F-18]FMe-McN binding to SERT was studied by preinjecting blocking doses of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporter inhibitors. Fluoxetine, a specific inhibitor for SERT, decreased the specific binding of [F-18]FMe-McN in raphe nuclei by 91 +/- 4%; in other regions rich in SERT, similar results were obtained. GBR12909 and nisoxetine, selective inhibitors for dopamine transporter (DAT) and norepinephrine transporter (NET), respectively, showed no significant effects on the uptake of [F-18]FMe-McN. Our studies show that [F-18]FMe-McN has a clear potential as a tracer for studies with PET of SERT function in humans. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Previous studies conducted in laboratory animals have revealed that the biological effects on serotonin reuptake for citalopram reside in the S enantiomer. In contrast, both enantiomers of fluoxetine contribute to its biological activity. Methods: In the present study, the potency and selectivity of escitalopram, R-fluoxetine, and all of the other currently available selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were compared for binding affinity at the human serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters and several select neurotransmitter receptors using radioligand binding assays. Results: Both escitalopram and R-fluoxetine were potent inhibitors of the serotonin transporter (K-i = 1.1 and 1.4 nmol/L, respectively). Escitalopram was the most serotonin transporter-selective compound tested and was similar to 30-fold more potent than R-citalopram. Conclusions: As noted previously, paroxetine and sertraline possess moderate affinity (< 50 nmol/L) for the human norepinephrine transporter and dopamine transporter, respectively. R-Fluoxetine, unlike the other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, possesses moderate affinity (K-i = 64 nmol/L) for the serotonin 2C receptor. Potential clinical correlates of these unique attributes of escitalopram and R-fluoxetine are discussed. Biol Psychiatry 2001;50: 345-350 (C) 2001 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Structure-activity relationships were evaluated where binding affinity for the glycine site of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor was measured using the specific radioligand [H-3]- L-689,560, and functional antagonism was demonstrated by inhibition of NMDA-induced depolarizations of rat cortical wedges. The ability to prevent NMDA-induced hyperlocomotion in mice in vivo was measured for selected compounds. Binding affinity increased significantly if the heterocyclic group, e.g. 1,2,3-triazol-1-yl could participate in accepting a hydrogen bond from the receptor. It was difficult to obtain compounds with adequate aqueous solubility and strategies to improve it were investigated. The most potent compound in this series, 6,7-dichloro-5-[1-( 1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)propyl]-1,4-dihydro-(1H, 4H)-quinoxaline-2,3-dione (17) (binding IC50 = 2.6 nM; cortical wedge EC50 = 90 nM), inhibited NMDA-induced hyperlocomotion in mice (6/9 protected at 20 mg/kg iv).

To examine the role of tryptophan residues in the ligand binding domain of the 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) (5-HT3) receptor, we used site-directed mutagenesis to change each of the eight N-terminal tryptophan residues in the 5-HT3A receptor subunit to tyrosine or serine, The mutants were expressed as homomeric 5-HT3A receptors in HEK293 cells and analyzed with radioligand binding, electrophysiology, and immnunocytochemistry. Mutation of Trp(90), Trp(183), and Trp(195) to tyrosine resulted in functional receptors, although with increased EC50 values (2-92-fold) to 5-HT3 receptor agonists, Changing these residues to serine either ablated function (Trp(90) and Trp(183)) gp resulted in a further increase in EC50 (Trp(195)). Mutation of residue Trp(60) had no effect on Ligand binding or receptor function, whereas mutation of Trp(95), Trp(102), Trp(121), and Trp(214) ablated ligand binding and receptor function, and all but one of the receptors containing these mutations were not expressed at the plasma membrane. We propose that Trp(90), Trp(183), and Trp(195) are intimately involved in Ligand binding, whereas Trp(95), Trp(102), Trp(121), and Trp(214) have a critical role in receptor structure or assembly.

The KOR affinity was determined in receptor binding studies with the radioligand [H-3]U-69 593. The high KOR affinity of endo-configured amines 10a (K-i = 7 nM) and 10b (K-i = 13 nM) indicates that the dihedral angle of the KOR pharmacophoric element N(pyrrolidine)-C-C-N(phenylacetyl) of 42 degrees is close to the bioactive conformation of more flexible KOR agonists. It should be noted that changing the configuration of potent and selective KOR agonists 10a and 10b led to potent and selective sigma(1) ligands (e.g. ent-10aK(i)(sigma(1)) = 10 nM).

The present study describes the radiosynthesis and pre-clinical evaluation of a new compound, exo-3-(6-methoxypyridin-2-yloxy)-8-H-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane (NS8880), targeting NET. NS8880 has an in vitro binding profile comparable to desipramine and is structurally not related to reboxetine. Methods: Labeling of NS8880 with [C-11] was achieved by a non-conventional technique: substitution of pyridinyl fluorine with [C-11]methanolate in a Boc-protected precursor. The isolated [C-11]NS8880 was evaluated pre-clinically both in a pig model (PET scanning) and in a rat model (mu PET scanning) and compared to (S,S)-[C-11]-O-methylreboxetine ([C-11] MeNER). Results: The radiolabeling technique yielded [C-11]NS8880 in low (<10%) but still useful yields with high purity. The PET in vivo evaluation in pig and rat revealed a rapid brain uptake of [C-11]NS8880 and fast obtaining of equilibrium. Highest binding was observed in thalamic and hypothalamic regions. Pretreatment with desipramine efficiently reduced binding of [C-11]NS8880. Conclusion: Based on the pre-clinical results obtained so far [C-11]NS8880 displays promising properties for PET imaging of NET. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reciprocal alterations in cortical cannabinoid receptor 1 binding relative to protein immunoreactivity and transcript levels in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						CB1R; Cannabis; Cannabinoid; Marijuana; PET; Rimonabant; Radioligand; Prefrontal cortex; Schizophrenia	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CB1 RECEPTOR; MESSENGER-RNA; EXPRESSION; PSYCHOSIS; DENSITY; NEURONS	The deleterious effects of cannabis use in schizophrenia have been linked, in part, to underlying disturbances in endogenous cannabinoid signaling in the prefrontal cortex. However, while receptor autoradiography studies of the primary cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) have consistently found higher CB1R binding in the prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, deficits in CB1R mRNA levels and protein immunoreactivity have also been reported in the illness. To investigate this apparent discrepancy, we quantified CB1R binding using receptor autoradiography with the selective CB1R ligand [H-3]-OMAR in the prefrontal cortex of 21 subjects with schizophrenia who were previously found to have lower levels of both CB1R mRNA using in situ hybridization and CB1R protein using radioimmunocytochemistry relative to matched healthy comparison subjects. We observed higher levels of [H-3]-OMAR binding in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects that did not appear to be attributable to psychotropic medications or substance abuse. The combination of lower levels of CB1R mRNA and immunoreactivity with higher CB1R receptor binding may reflect 1) altered trafficking of the receptor resulting in higher levels of membrane-bound CB1R or 2) higher CB1R affinity. In either case, greater CB1R receptor availability may contribute to the increased susceptibility of schizophrenia subjects to the deleterious effects of cannabis use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

Effects of Lys2 to Ala2 substitutions on the structure and potency of ω-conotoxins MVIIA and CVID	BIOPOLYMERS			English	Article						-conotoxins; voltage-gated calcium channels; NMR spectroscopy; structure-activity relationship; radioligand binding	CALCIUM-CHANNEL BLOCKERS; COMMON AMINO-ACIDS; 3-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE; COUPLING-CONSTANTS; FUNCTIONAL ASSAY; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PEPTIDE TOXIN; CA2+ CHANNEL; CYSTINE KNOT; GVIA	Lys2 has previously been implicated as a residue important in binding interactions between ?-conotoxins and the N-type calcium channel. To further assess the importance of this residue, Lys2 to Ala2 derivatives of ?-conotoxins MVIIA and CVID were synthesized and their structures and binding potencies determined. A comparison of the 3D structures of the Ala2 mutants with the parent peptides suggest there are significant structural differences brought about by this substitution. In particular, stabilizing interactions between Lys2 and loop 2 of the ?-conotoxins are removed, leading to greater flexibility in loop 2, which contains Tyr13, a crucial residue for ?-conotoxin binding to the N- and P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC). The significant drop in binding potencies resulting from replacement of Lys2 thus appears to relate more to entropic factors than to any direct interaction of Lys2 with the VGCC. This has significant implications for the development of a pharmacophore binding model for ?-conotoxins, as removal of Lys2 from consideration suggests that the ?-conotoxins residues that interact with the N-type VGCC reside in loop 2 and 4, and thus cover a significantly smaller and more defined area of the surface of ?-conotoxin than previously thought.

Zebrafish neurotransmitter systems as potential pharmacological and toxicological targets	NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY			English	Article						Zebrafish; Contaminants; Neurotransmission; Neurotoxicity	MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; IONOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DANIO-RERIO; NICOTINIC RECEPTORS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; NUCLEOTIDE HYDROLYSIS; EMBRYONIC EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND BINDING	Recent advances in neurobiology have emphasized the study of brain structure and function and its association with numerous pathological and toxicological events. Neurotransmitters are substances that relay, amplify, and modulate electrical signals between neurons and other cells. Neurotransmitter signaling mediates rapid intercellular communication by interacting with cell surface receptors, activating second messenger systems and regulating the activity of ion channels. Changes in the functional balance of neurotransmitters have been implicated in the failure of central nervous system function. In addition, abnormalities in neurotransmitter production or functioning can be induced by several toxicological compounds, many of which are found in the environment. The zebrafish has been increasingly used as an animal model for biomedical research, primarily due to its genetic tractability and ease of maintenance. These features make this species a versatile tool for pre-clinical drug discovery and toxicological investigations. Here, we present a review regarding the role of different excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish, such as dopaminergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic, purinergic, histaminergic, nitrergic, glutamatergic, glycinergic, and GABAergic systems, and emphasizing their features as pharmacological and toxicological targets. The increase in the global knowledge of neurotransmitter systems in zebrafish and the elucidation of their pharmacological and toxicological aspects may lead to new strategies and appropriate research priorities to offer insights for biomedical and environmental research.

As among various available radioligands [I-125]-iodocyanopindolol ([I-125]-ICYP) exhibited the smallest problems in labeling cloned human beta(3)-adrenoceptors in previous studies, we have explored its suitability to label beta(3)-adrenoceptors in rat urinary bladder in saturation and competition radioligand binding experiments. Rat lung was used as an internal control and exhibited all characteristics expected from this tissue with regard to beta(3)/beta(2)-adrenoceptor labeling. Saturation and competition binding studies with ([I-125]-ICYP in rat bladder yielded saturable binding sites with an affinity compatible with beta(3)-adrenoceptors. In competition experiments various agonists and antagonists largely exhibited a profile compatible with a population consisting largely of beta(3)-adrenoceptors. However, the binding competition properties of ICI 118,551 and SR 59,230A were not easily explained by the idea of labeling a homogeneous beta(3)-adrenoceptor population but interpretation of the data was limited by a high degree of non-specific binding in ([I-125]-ICYP concentrations required to label the receptors. We conclude that ([I-125]-ICYP can be used to label tissue beta(3)-adrenoceptors but results obtained with this ligand have to be interpreted with caution.

Methods: Positron emission tomography (PET) was used to address, in 25 and 53 healthy volunteers, respectively, the possible association between six polymorphisms in the gene encoding BDNF and the availability of two proteins expressed by serotonergic neurons: the 5-HTT, measured with the radioligand [C-11]MADAM, and the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor, measured with [C-11]WAY-100635. Results: Several single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with [C-11]MADAM binding potential (BP) in most brain regions, male carriers of the valine/valine genotype of the Val66Met polymorphism displaying higher availability. Effect sizes ranged from a 50% to a threefold increase. In contrast, there was no association for [C-11]WAY-100635 BP. The observation that BDNF polymorphisms were associated with 5-HTT availability could be partly replicated in an independent population comprising nine male suicide attempters and nine matched control subjects, in which transporter availability had been measured with single photon emission computed tomography with I-123-beta-CIT as ligand. Conclusions: Our results suggest that genetic variation in BDNF influences 5-HTT but not 5-HT1A receptor density in the human brain.

In a previous human study using quantitative Western blotting and radioligand binding assay, dopaminergic terminal marker deficits were induced in chronic METH users. In this study, we examined the suitability of the immunohistochemical detection of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT), and vesicular monoamine transporter-2 (VMAT2) levels, and caspase-3 activation in the striatum to diagnose METH abuse. Decreases in TH immunoreactivity in the nucleus accumbens and DAT in the nucleus accumbens and putamen were induced in METH users, whereas a significant difference of VMAT2 was not evident between METH and control groups. However, in the nucleus accumbens of two METH users, levels of VMAT2, a stable marker of striatal dopaminergic terminal integrity, were reduced remarkably. These findings might indicate that dopaminergic terminal degeneration is induced in the striatum of some METH abusers. On the other hand, we observed little caspase-3 activation, indicative of apoptosis, in the striatal neurons of chronic METH users. Overall, the findings of dopaminergic terminal markers were similar to those in the previous human study. Therefore, it is suggested that immunohistochemical techniques could be used to examine dopaminergic terminal marker levels and could also give useful information on chronic and/or lethal METH use in cases of METH-related death, where METH intoxication may not be toxicologically demonstrated.

To optimize it, two modifications have been introduced into [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide ([I-125]TOC): C-terminal Thr-for-Thr(ol) exchange (leading to Tyr(3)-octreotate (TOCA)) and N-terminal derivatization with different carbohydrates. Both have significant impact on radioligand uptake into sst(2)-expressing cells in vitro and in vivo. Glucose conjugation via Amadori reaction by itself led to improved tumor uptake of [I-123] Gluc-TOC in vivo, which is based on an enhancement of peptide internalization despite a reduction in receptor affinity. In the case of the doubly modified analogues [I-123]Gluc-TOCA, [I-123]Gluc-S-TOCA, and [I-123] Gal-S-TOCA, a cumulative effect of both structural modifications was observed, leading up to a 5-fold increased uptake of these compounds in sst-expressing tumors compared to [I-125]TOC. Thus, glycosylation with small carbohydrates was found to be a suitable tool to enhance receptor-mediated uptake of radiolabeled octreotide analogues into sst-positive malignancies, leading to tracers with excellent characteristics for in vivo sst-imaging applications.

The log P-7,P-4 value of KF21652 was 3.14, and the K-i value was 13 nM for adenosine transporters using [H-3]nitrobenzylthioinosine as a radioligand. In mice, the highest initial uptake was found in the liver, followed by the kidney and small intestine. The brain uptake was very low. The radioactivity level slightly increased with time in the liver and small intestine, but decreased in the other organs. Coinjection of carrier KF21652 slightly decreased the uptake of [C-11]KF21562 only in the liver, but not in any other organs. Ex vivo autoradiography of the rat brain showed that [C-11]KF21652 was scarcely incorporated into the brain. On the other hand, in vitro autoradiography showed the binding of [C-11]KF21562 to adenosine transporters with high nonspecific binding. These results show that the compound is not a suitable PET ligand for mapping adenosine transporters. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

To evaluate the possibility of using this tracer for the in vivo quantification of these receptors, an accurate measurement of the plasma concentration of the parent compound is necessary. In human or nonhuman primate whole blood as well as in plasma, the parent compound is only stable for approximately 5 min, after which it decomposes. The radioligand is stable in the injection solution and in protein-free (>30 K M.W.) plasma ultrafiltrate for at least 18 h. To preserve the parent compound in plasma the radioactive plasma must be mixed with equal volumes of acetonitrile within 5 min after its collection or, alternatively, radioactive blood should be collected and mixed with sodium azide (3 mg/ml blood). The in vivo metabolism of [I-123]5-IA resulted in two components: a radiometabolite that is less lipophilic than the parent compound and a polar radiometabolite that is not free radioiodide because of the absence of radioactivity accumulation in the thyroid.

Pretreatment of H3922 cells,vith OM for 72 h suppressed EGF-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation signals by 77%, Interestingly, pretreatment with OM for 6 or 48 h had little effect on these signals. EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of EGF receptor (EGFR) was suppressed by 55% in 72-h OM pretreated H3922 cells. No reduction in EGFR protein expression was detected in these cells, Flow cytometric analysis verified that OM does not suppress EGFR expression, The effect of OM could not be attributed to induction of protein tyrosine phosphatases. An H3922 subclone cell line, designated H3922-8, was found to exhibit no proliferative response to treatment with EGF. However, EGF-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected in these cells. Radioligand EGF binding studies comparing H3922 to H3922-8 cells indicated that the clonal cells apparently lack high affinity EGF receptors, The mechanism by which OM suppresses EGF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation has not been completely characterized. However, the suppressive effect occurs regardless of whether the cells are acutely responsive (H3922) or virtually unresponsive (H3922-8) to EGF stimulation of cell growth. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

Although N-benzyl substitution of 5-methoxytryptamine is known to increase its affinity and potency at 5-HT2 receptors associated with psychedelic activity, N-benzylated tryptamines have been studied much less than their phenethylamine analogs. To further our knowledge of the activity of N-benzyltryptamines, we have synthesized a family of tryptamine derivatives and, for comparison, a few 5-methoxytryptamine analogs with many different substitution patterns on the benzyl moiety, and subjected them to in vitro affinity and functional activity assays vs. the human 5-HT2 receptor subtypes. In the binding (radioligand displacement) studies some of these compounds exhibited only modest selectivity for either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors suggesting that a few of them, with affinities in the 10-100 nanomolar range for 5-HT2A receptors, might presumably be psychedelic. Unexpectedly, their functional (calcium mobilization) assays reflected very different trends. All of these compounds proved to be 5-HT2C receptor full agonists while most of them showed low efficacy at the 5-HT2A subtype. Furthermore, several showed moderateto-strong preferences for activation of the 5-HT2C subtype at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, although some N-benzyltryptamines might be abuse-liable, others might represent new leads for the development of therapeutics for weight loss, erectile dysfunction, drug abuse, or schizophrenia.

This can be assessed by studying the expression patterns of marker genes that are relevant in particular functional circuits. In all vertebrates, the dopaminergic system is responsible for the behavioral responses to environmental stimuli. Here we show that the brain regions that receive dopaminergic input through dopamine receptor D-1 are relatively conserved, but with some important variations between three evolutionarily distant vertebrate lines-house mouse (Mus musculus), domestic chick (Gallus gallus domesticus) / common quail (Coturnix coturnix) and red-eared slider turtle (Trachemys scripta). Moreover, we find that in almost all instances, those brain regions expressing D-1 like dopamine receptor genes also express Wfsl. Wfsl has been studied primarily in the pancreas, where it regulates the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response, cellular Ca2+ homeostasis, and insulin production and secretion. Using radioligand binding assays in wild type and Wfsli-mouse brains, we show that the number of binding sites of Dl-like dopamine receptors is increased in the hippocampus of the mutant mice. We propose that the functional link between Wfsl and Dl-like dopamine receptors is evolutionarily conserved and plays an important role in adjusting behavioral reactions to environmental stimuli.

Even though Parkinson's disease (PD) is primarily a motor disorder, reports of impaired executive function are also steadily being associated with this disease. Not much is known about the pathophysiology behind this. The aim of this study was thereby twofold: (1) to investigate 5-HT2A receptor binding levels in Parkinson's brains and (2) to investigatewhether PDassociated pathology, alpha-synuclein (AS) overexpression, could be associated with 5-HT2A alterations. Binding density for the 5-HT2A-specific radioligand [H-3]-MDL 100.907 was measured in membrane suspensions of frontal cortex tissue from PD patients. Protein levels of AS were further measured using western blotting. Results showed higher AS levels accompanied by increased 5-HT2A receptor binding in PD brains. In a separate study, we looked for changes in 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex in 52-week-old transgenic mice overexpressing human AS. We performed region-specific 5-HT2A receptor binding measurements followed by gene expression analysis. The transgenic mice showed lower 5-HT2A binding in the frontal association cortex that was not accompanied by changes in gene expression levels. This study is one of the first to look at differences in serotonin receptor levels in PD and in relation to AS overexpression.

Once activated, these enzymes initiate cellular death through cleavage of proteins which are responsible for DNA repair, signaling and cell maintenance. Several radiofluorinated inhibitors of caspases-3 and -7, comprising a moderate lipophilic 5-(1-pyrrolidinylsulfonyl)isatin lead structure, are currently being investigated for imaging apoptosis in vivo by us and others. The purpose of this study was to increase the intrinsic hydrophilicity of the aforementioned lead structure to alter the pharmacokinetic behavior of the resulting caspase-3 and -7 targeted radiotracer. Therefore, fluorinated and non-fluorinated derivatives of 5-(1-pyrrolidinylsulfonyl)-7-azaisatin were synthesized and tested for their inhibitory properties against recombinant caspases-3 and -7. Fluorine-18 has been introduced by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) of an alkyne precursor with 2-[F-18]fluoroethylazide. Using dynamic micro-PET biodistribution studies in vivo the kinetic behavior of one promising PET-compatible 5-pyrrolidinylsulfonyl 7-azaisatin derivative has been compared to a previously described isatin based radiotracer.

While the potential use of simultaneous MRI/PET for clinical diagnostic and disease staging has been demonstrated recently; the biological relevance of concurrent functional MRI-PET brain imaging to dissect neurochemically distinct components of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI signal has not yet been shown. We obtained sixteen fMRI-PET data sets from eight healthy volunteers. Each subject participated in randomized order in a pain scan and a control (nonpainful pressure) scan on the same day. Dynamic PET data were acquired with an opioid radioligand, [C-11] diprenorphine, to detect endogenous opioid releases in response to pain. BOLD fMRI data were collected at the same time to capture hemodynamic responses. In this simultaneous human fMRI-PET imaging study, we show co-localized responses in thalamus and striatum related to pain processing, while modality specific brain networks were also found. Co-localized fMRI and PET signal changes in the thalamus were positively correlated suggesting that pain-induced changes in opioid neurotransmission contribute a significant component of the fMRI signal change in this region. Simultaneous fMRI-PET provides unique opportunities allowing us to relate specific neurochemical events to functional hemodynamic activation and to investigate the impacts of neurotransmission on neurovascular coupling of the human brain in vivo.

Radiation Dosimetry of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FPEB in Humans	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						F-18-FPEB; glutamate; mGluR5; radiation dosimetry	INTERNAL DOSE ASSESSMENT; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR 5; MGLUR5; BEHAVIORS; BINDING; MODELS; MICE; PET	F-18-3-fluoro-5-[(pyridin-3-yl)ethynylibenzonitrile (F-18-FPEB) is a potent and specific radioligand for the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5). Before undertaking clinical research studies with F-18-FPEB, we performed studies of human radiation dosimetry. Methods: Serial whole-body scans were obtained in 9 healthy human subjects (5 men, 4 women) for 190-440 min after the intravenous administration of F-18-FPEB. Radiation doses were estimated using the OLINDA/EXM software. Results: Peak organ doses were to the urinary bladder wall, 0.258 mGy/MBq (0.955 rad/mCi), and gallbladder wall, 0.193 mGy/MBq (0.716 rad/mCi). The effective dose was 0.025 mSv/MBq (0.0922 rem/mCi). The doses to the red marrow and spleen were 0.00797 mGy/MBq (0.0295 rad/mCi) and 0.00709 mGy/MBq (0.0262 rad/mCi), respectively. Reducing the urinary voiding interval to 60 or 90 min lowered the urinary bladder wall dose to 0.0885 mGy/MBq (0.327 rad/mCi) or 0.128 mGy/MBq (0.473 rad/mCi), respectively, and the effective dose to 0.0149 mSv/MBq (0.0551 rem/mCi) or 0.0171 mSv/MBq (0.0634 rem/mCi), respectively. Conclusion: Urinary voiding should be performed during F-18-FPEB studies to minimize radiation exposure to research subjects.

Methods Positron emission tomography (PET) studies were undertaken using the radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 in eight control subjects at baseline and after administration of zolmitriptan orodispersible tablets. The subjects were examined after two consecutive administrations of 10mg zolmitriptan, approximately 1 week apart. Two of the subjects were subsequently examined after administration of 5 mg zolmitriptan. One week after the last administration of zolmitriptan five of the subjects underwent additional PET measurements without drug pretreatment. Results After administration of 10mg zolmitriptan, mean receptor occupancy was 4-5%. No consistent changes in 5-HT1B receptor binding were observed for subjects who received 5mg zolmitriptan. There was a statistically significant negative relationship between binding potential (BPND) and plasma concentration of zolmitriptan and the active metabolite 183C91, respectively. All of the five subjects who were examined 1 week after dosing with zolmitriptan showed higher BPND post drug administration compared with baseline. Conclusion This is the first demonstration of CNS 5-HT1B receptor occupancy of a triptan. The findings are consistent with the low receptor occupancy previously reported in PET studies with agonists at other G protein coupled receptors.

A direct pharmacologic intervention at the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) was proposed as an alternative therapeutic approach and promising in vitro and in vivo results were obtained with the bispyridinium compound SAD-128. In addition, a number of SAD-128 analogues improved neuromuscular transmission of soman-poisoned diaphragms in vitro. We investigated the interaction of six of these SAD-128 analogues with the orthosteric binding site of the human alpha 7 nAChR and Torpedo californica nAChR with a high-throughput assay using radioactive ligands. The determined affinity constants indicate a weak interaction of three test compounds (K-i in the micromolar range) with both receptors, but no interaction could be recorded with the other three test compounds. The six SAD-128 analogues showed a low intrinsic inhibitory potency with human acetylcholinesterase (IC50 > 400 mu M). In conclusion, the results of the present study do not indicate a correlation between the affinity to the orthosteric binding site and the functional improvement of neuromuscular transmission and it is assumed that other mechanisms contribute to the therapeutic effect of the tested compounds.

J	Willard, FS; Siderovski, DP				Willard, FS; Siderovski, DP			The R6A-1 peptide binds to switch II of Gα<sub>i1</sub> but is not a GDP-dissociation inhibitor	BIOCHEMICAL AND BIOPHYSICAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						BODIPYFL-GTP gamma S; GDI; GoLoco motif; G-protein; guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor; KB-752; R6A; R6A-1; switch region	HETEROTRIMERIC G-PROTEIN; FLUORESCENCE-BASED ASSAYS; NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING; ALPHA-SUBUNITS; GOLOCO MOTIF; ACTIVATION; RECOGNITION; DIVISION; RECEPTOR; ANALOGS	Heterotrimeric G-proteins are molecular switches that convert signals from membrane receptors into changes in intracellular physiology. Recently, several peptides that bind heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunits have been isolated including the novel G alpha(i1) (.) GDP binding peptides R6A and KB-752. The R6A peptide and its minimized derivative R6A-1 interact with G alpha(i1) (.) GDP. Based on spectroscopic analysis of BODIPYFL-GTP gamma S binding to G alpha(i1), it has been reported that R6A-1 has guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) activity against G alpha(i1) [W.W. Ja, RM. Roberts, Biochemistry 43 (28) (2004) 9265-9275]. Using radioligand binding, we show that R6A-1 is not a GDI for G alpha(i1) subunits. Furthermore, we demonstrate that R6A-1 reduces the fluorescence quantum yield of the G alpha(i1)-BODI-PYFL-GTP gamma S complex, thus explaining the previously reported GDI activity as a fluorescence artifact. We further show that R6A-1 has significant sequence similarity to the guanine nucleotide exchange factor peptide KB-752 that binds to switch 11 of G alpha(i1). We use competitive binding analysis to show that R6A-1 also binds to switch 11 of G alpha subunits. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PBMCs were stimulated with interleukin-2 (IL-2), tetanus toxoid (TT), anti-CD3 antibody, or phytohemagglutinin (PHA). The cytokines interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), IL-4, and IL-6 were determined by ELISA following coincubation with high-dose (10(-5) M) and low-dose (10(-9) M) epinephrine (EPI) and norepinephrine (NE). Intracellular IFN-gamma and IL-4 were studied by FACS analysis. The beta 2R density was investigated using a radioligand binding assay. The stimuli induced various cytokine profiles in PBMCs. Synthesis of IFN-gamma was induced by all mitogens and could be suppressed by catecholamines (26% - 85% reduction). In PHA-stimulated PBMCs, IL-4 synthesis was decreased by high-dose catecholamines (24% - 28% reduction). Adding a beta-blocking agent attenuated most catecholamine effects. A highly significant negative correlation between the density of beta 2R with IFN-gamma and IL-6 levels of PHA-activated PBMCs ( r = - 0.88 to - 0.96, p < 0.01 - < 0.001) was observed. The results indicate that the density of beta 2R on PBMC plays a role in mediating the differential catecholamine effects on cytokine production of PBMC. Furthermore, changes in cytokine expression induced by catecholamines favor Th2 responses.

J	Lin, KS; Ding, YS				Lin, KS; Ding, YS			Synthesis, enantiomeric resolution, and selective C-11 methylation of a highly selective radioligand for imaging the norepinephrine transporter with positron emission tomography	CHIRALITY			English	Article						reboxetine; antidepressant; chiral HPLC; carbon-11; radiotracer; PET	RADIOTRACERS; SEPARATION; PET; DERIVATIVES; REBOXETINE; CELLULOSE; BRAIN; MOUSE	Reboxetine, 2-[alpha-(2-ethoxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine, is a highly selective norepinephrine transporter (NET) blocker that has been used for the treatment of depression. Its methyl analogue, 2-[alpha-(2-methoxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine (MRB), has been radiolabeled with C-11 for studies of the NET system with positron emission tomography (PET). The normethyl precursor, 2-alpha-(2-hydroxyphenoxy)benzyl]morpholine (desethylreboxetine), was synthesized in 6% overall yield via a multi-step regio- and stereo-specific synthesis, starting from a mono-O-protected catechol. The resulting racemic mixture of desethylreboxetine was resolved by chiral HPLC to provide the (2S,3S) and (2R,3R) enantiomers in >98% enantiomeric excess. These enantiomers were then used as precursors for radiosynthesis to prepare enantiomerically pure individual C-11-labeled MRB enantiomers for comparative PET studies in baboons. Selective C-11 methylation at the phenolic oxygen with [C-11]CH3I was achieved in the presence of excess base. After HPLC purification, racemic ((2S,3S)/(2R,3R)) or enantiomerically pure ((2S,3S) or (2R,3R)) [11C]MRB was obtained in 61-74% decay-corrected radiochemical yields from [11C]CH3I in a synthesis time of 40 min with a radiochemical purity of >96% and a specific activity of 1.7-2.3 Ci/mumol (63-85 GBq/mumol) corrected from the end of bombardment (EOB).

Methods: Sera from 68 patients with Graves' disease, 23 patients with autoimmune thyroiditis, and 119 healthy controls were evaluated in four different laboratories using both radioactive and chemiluminescent tracers. Functional sensitivity, interlaboratory precision, optimal cutoff values for Graves' disease, and the correlation between the two methods were evaluated. Results: Functional sensitivity was 0.98 IU/litre for both assays. Interlaboratory precision, expressed as per cent coefficient of variation over a wide range of antibody concentrations, varied from 5.7% to 15.1% for the radioligand, and from 6.6% to 19.9% for the chemiluminescence assay. The two methods ( radioactive and chemiluminescent) were closely correlated. All the sera from untreated or relapsing patients with Graves' disease gave TSH receptor antibody values above 2.1 IU/litre, whereas in none of the healthy controls did values exceed 2.5 IU/litre. Receiver operating curve analysis allowed an optimal cutoff point to be defined at 1.99 IU/litre, according to a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 99.1%. Conclusions: These data show the high analytical and diagnostic accuracy of the human TSH receptor assays, both with radioactive and chemiluminescent tracers, when both functional sensitivity and interlaboratory reproducibility are considered. These two methods could be proposed as first line diagnostic markers for Graves' disease.

We investigated the effects of ET-1 on growth and collagen synthesis responses in cardiac fibroblasts isolated from human hearts. We also studied the receptor subtype(s) mediating such responses and the factors regulating their expression. Methods: Fibroblasts were isolated from cardiac transplant recipient hearts and characterised by immunocytochemistry. Serum-starved cells were exposed to ET-1 and incorporation of [H-3]proline and thymidine were measured as indexes of collagen and DNA synthesis respectively. Blocking experiments utilised the selective ETA receptor antagonist BQ123 and the ETB antagonist BQ788. Results: ET-1 elicited a potent collagen synthesis response in cardiac fibroblasts, with a maximum 29+/-5% increase that was abolished by BQ123. Cardiac fibroblasts responded to ET-1 with a concentration-dependent decrease to those of TGF-beta. Radioligand binding studies revealed the presence of high-affinity ET-1 binding sites on these cells, which were upregulated by treatment with the growth factors PDGF and EGF but downregulated by TGF-beta. Conclusions: These results therefore implicate ET-1 as a trophic agent in the human heart with the ability to influence the development of cardiac fibrosis. Copyright (C) 2004 S. Karger AG, Basel.

J. Pharmacol. 286 (1995) 137). To identify the protein constituent of the levetiracetam binding site in situ, we synthesized the photoaffinity label [H-3]ucb 30889 ((2S)-2-[4-(3-azidophenyl)-2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl]butanamide), a levetiracetam analog with higher affinity for the levetiracetam binding site. This radioligand was used to map the levetiracetam binding site within the brain and to study its cellular and subcellular distribution. Autoradiography experiments using [H-3]ucb 30889 in rat brain revealed a unique distribution profile that did not match that of classical receptors known to be involved in the generation of epileptic seizures. There was a high level of binding in the dentate gyrus, the superior colliculus, several thalamic nuclei, the molecular layer of the cerebellum and to a lesser extent in the cerebral cortex, the striatum and the hypothalamus. The levetiracetam binding site was restricted to neuronal cell types, undifferentiated PC 12 cells and was highly enriched in synaptic vesicles. [H-3]ucb 30889 was also used in photoaffinity labelling studies and shown to bind covalently to a membrane protein with a molecular weight of approximately 90 kDa. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we develop new fluorescently labeled ligands that bind DAT with high affinity and enable single-molecule detection of the transporter. The cocaine analogue MFZ2-12 (1) was conjugated to novel rhodamine-based Janelia Fluorophores (JF(549) and JF(646)). High affinity binding of the resulting ligands to DAT was demonstrated by potent inhibition of [H-3]dopamine uptake in DAT transfected CAD cells and by competition radioligand binding experiments on rat striatal membranes. Visualization of binding was substantiated by confocal or TIRF microscopy revealing selective binding of the analogues to DAT transfected CAD cells. Single particle tracking experiments were performed with JF(5)(49)-conjugated DG3-80 (3) and JF(646)-conjugated DG4-91 (4) on DAT transfected CAD cells enabling quantification and categorization of the dynamic behavior of DAT into four distinct motion classes (immobile, confined, Brownian, and directed). Finally, we show that the ligands can be used in direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) experiments permitting further analyses of DAT distribution on the nanoscale. In summary, these novel fluorescent ligands are promising new tools for studying DAT localization and regulation with single-molecule resolution.

Key findingsThe K-D values measured by frontal analysis were (8.720.21)x10(-7)M for azelastine, (9.12 +/- 0.26)x10(-7)M for cyproheptadine, (9.90 +/- 0.18)x10(-7)M for doxepin, (1.42 +/- 0.13)x10(-6)M for astemizole, (2.25 +/- 0.36)x10(-6)M for chlorpheniramine and (3.10 +/- 0.27)x10(-6)M for diphenhydramine. The results had a positive correlation with those from radioligand binding assay. The ability of displacement order measured on the binding sites occupied by doxepin was doxepin (K-D,K- (2.95 +/- 0.21)x10(-8)M)>astemizole (K-D,K- (5.03 +/- 0.18)x10(-7)M)>chlorpheniramine (K-D,K- (1.27 +/- 0.16)x10(-6)M)>cyproheptadine (K-D,K- (1.61 +/- 0.27)x10(-6)M), whose order met with the scores by molecular docking study. ConclusionsThe studies showed CMC could be applied to investigate drug-receptor interactions.

Here we show that resistance to imidacloprid in a selected strain of Nilaparvata lugens is associated with a reduction in expression levels of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit Nl8. Synergism bioassays of the selected strain suggested resistance was conferred, in part, by a target-site mechanism. Sequencing of N.lugens nAChR subunit genes identified no mutations associated with resistance, however, a decrease in mRNA and protein levels of Nl8 was observed during selection. RNA interference knockdown of Nl8 decreased the sensitivity of N.lugens to imidacloprid, demonstrating that a decrease in Nl8 expression is sufficient to confer resistance invivo. Radioligand binding assays revealed that the affinity of the high-affinity imidacloprid-binding site of native nAChRs was reduced by selection, and reducing the amount of Nl8 cRNA injected into Xenopus oocytes significantly decreased imidacloprid potency on recombinant receptors. Taken together, these results provide strong evidence that a decrease in Nl8 levels confers resistance to imidacloprid in N.lugens, and thus provides a rare example of target-site resistance associated with a quantitative rather than qualitative change.

Modulation of Ionotropic GABA Receptors by 6-Methoxyflavanone and 6-Methoxyflavone	NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						GABA; Flavone; Flavanone; Benzodiazepine; Flavonoid; GABA receptors	CONFERS BARBITURATE SENSITIVITY; HIGH-AFFINITY; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; FLAVONE DERIVATIVES; BINDING; SUBTYPE; LIGAND; SITE; AMENTOFLAVONE; PHARMACOLOGY	We evaluated the effects of 6-methoxyflavanone and 6-methoxyflavone on wild-type alpha 1/alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2L GABA(A) and rho 1 GABA(C) receptors and on mutant rho 1I307S, rho 1W328 M, rho 1I307S/W328 M GABA(C) receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes using two-electrode voltage clamp and radioligand binding. 6-Methoxyflavanone and 6-methoxyflavone act as a flumazenil-insensitive positive allosteric modulator of GABA responses at human recombinant alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2L and alpha 2 beta 2 gamma 2L GABA(A) receptors. However, unlike 6-methoxyflavone, 6-methoxyflavanone was relatively inactive at alpha 1 beta 2 GABA(A) receptors. 6-Methoxyflavanone inhibited [H-3]-flunitrazepam binding to rat brain membranes. Both flavonoids were found to be inactive as modulators at rho 1, rho 1I307S and rho 1W328 M GABA receptors but acted as positive allosteric modulators of GABA at the benzodiazepine sensitive rho 1I307S/W328 M GABA receptors. This double mutant retains rho 1 properties of being insensitive to bicuculline and antagonised by TPMPA and THIP. Additionally, 6-methoxyflavanone was also a partial agonist at rho 1W328 M GABA receptors. The relative inactivity of 6-methoxyflavanone at alpha 1 beta 2 GABA(A) receptors and it's partial agonist action at rho 1W328 M GABA receptors suggest that it exhibits a unique profile not matched by other flavonoids.

The inhibitory effects of the extract were qualitatively and quantitatively estimated by phase-contrast microscopy and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. The extract exhibited a potent and dose-dependent inhibition of the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity in the culture media. Further, using radioligand binding assays, it was observed that the inhibitory effect of the extract was more potent and selective for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated toxicity. The S.B. ethanol extract competed with [H-3] MDL 105,519 for the specific binding to the NMDA receptor glycine site with 50% inhibition occurring at 35.1 mu g/mL. Further, NMDA receptor inactivation by the S.B. ethanol extract was concluded from the decreasing binding capability of [H-3] MK-801 in the presence of the extract. Thus, S.B. extract exhibited neuroprotection against excitotoxic cell death, and this neuroprotection was mediated through the inhibition of NMDA receptor function by interacting with the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor. Phytochemical analysis of the bioactive extract revealed the presence of six phytochemical constituents including baicalein, baicalin, wogonin, wogonoside, scutellarin, and Oroxylin A.

Insect nicotinic receptor interactions in vivo with neonicotinoid, organophosphorus, and methylcarbamate insecticides and a synergist	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							IMIDACLOPRID BINDING-SITE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; AGONISTS; RESISTANCE; BRAIN	The nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChR) is the principal insecticide target. Nearly half of the insecticides by number and world market value are neonicotinoids acting as nAChR agonists or organophosphorus (OP) and methylcarbamate (MC) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. There was no previous evidence for in vivo interactions of the nAChR agonists and AChE inhibitors. The nitromethyleneimidazole (NMI) analog of imidacloprid, a highly potent neonicotinoid, was used here as a radioligand, uniquely allowing for direct measurements of house fly (Musca domestica) head nAChR in vivo interactions with various nicotinic agents. Nine neonicotinoids inhibited house fly brain nAChR [H-3]NMI binding in vivo, corresponding to their in vitro potency and the poisoning signs or toxicity they produced in intrathoracically treated house flies. Interestingly, nine topically applied OP or MC insecticides or analogs also gave similar results relative to in vivo nAChR binding inhibition and toxicity, but now also correlating with in vivo brain AChE inhibition, indicating that ACh is the ultimate OP- or MC-induced nAChR active agent. These findings on [H-3]NMI binding in house fly brain membranes validate the nAChR in vivo target for the neonicotinoids, OPs and MCs. As an exception, the remarkably potent OP neonicotinoid synergist, O-propyl O-(2-propynyl) phenylphosphonate, inhibited nAChR in vivo without the corresponding AChE inhibition, possibly via a reactive ketene metabolite reacting with a critical nucleophile in the cytochrome P450 active site and the nAChR NMI binding site.

A mixture of (7,12-dihydrotetraphene-12-yl)methanamine and (6,11-dihydrotetracene-11-yl)methanamine in a 75-25% ratio was found to have an apparent K-i of 10 nM at the 5-HT2A receptor. A substantial binding affinity for (7,12-dihydrotetraphene-3-methoxy-12-yl)methanamine at the 5-HT2A receptor (K-i = 21 nM) was also observed. Interestingly, this compound was found to have 100-fold selectivity for 5-HT2A over the H-1 receptor (K-i = 2500 nM). N-Phenylalkyl-AMDA derivatives, in which the length of the alkyl chain varied from methylene to n-butylene, were found to have only weak affinity for both 5-HT2A and H-1 receptors (K-i = 223 to 964 nM). Our results show that large rigid annulated AMDA analogs can be sterically accommodated within the proposed 5-HT2A binding site. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The sigma1 receptor interacts with N-alkyl amines and endogenous sphingolipids	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Sigma1 receptor; Sphingolipid; Alkyl amine; Ligand binding; Endogenous ligand	TUMOR-CELL-LINES; MOLECULAR-CLONING; LIGAND-BINDING; HIGH-AFFINITY; LIPID RAFTS; RAT-LIVER; SIGMA-1-RECEPTOR; IDENTIFICATION; SPHINGOSINE; SITES	The sigma1 receptor is distinguished for its ability to bind various pharmacological agents including drugs of abuse such as cocaine and methamphetamine. Some endogenous ligands have been identified as putative sigma1 receptor regulators. High affinity ligands for the sigma1 receptor contain a nitrogen atom connected to long alkyl chains. We found that long alkyl chain primary amines including endogenous amines belonging to the sphingolipid family such as D-erythro-sphingosine and sphinganine bind with considerable affinity to the sigma1 receptor but not to the sigma2 receptor. The binding Of D-erythro-sphingosine to the sigma1 receptor appears to be competitive in nature as assessed against the radioligand [H-3]-(+)-pentazocine. Interestingly, the well studied sphingolipid mediator sphingosine-1 phosphate did not bind to the sigma1 or the sigma2 receptor. Sphingosine is converted to sphingosine-1 phosphate by a family of sphingosine kinases that regulate the relative levels of these two bioactive lipids in the cell. The selective binding of sphingosine but not sphingosine-1 phosphate to the sigma1 receptor suggests a mechanism for regulation of sigma1 receptor activity by the sphingosine kinase. We have successfully reconstituted this hypothetical model in HEK-293 cells overexpressing both the sigma1 receptor and sphingosine kinase-1. The data presented here strongly supports sphingosine as an endogenous modulator of the sigma1 receptor. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The compounds were synthesized by substituting the chlorine atom of the pyrazine ring with various N-alkyl-4-piperidinylmethanolates. They were evaluated in binding assays with [H-3] GR113808 (1) as the 5-HT4 receptor radioligand. The affinity values (K-i or inhibition percentages) were affected by both the substituent on the aromatic ring and the substituent on the lateral piperidine chain. A methyl group on the tricyclic ring produced a marked increase in affinity while an N-propyl or N-butyl group gave compounds with nanomolar affinities. Among the most potent ligands, 34d was selected for further pharmacological studies and evaluated in vivo. This compound acts as an antagonist/weak partial agonist in COS-7 cells stably expressing the 5-HT4(a) receptor and is of great interest as a peripheral antinociceptive agent. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Allosteric modulation of the muscarinic M<sub>4</sub> receptor as an approach to treating schizophrenia	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						cholinergic; GPCR; cooperativity	POSITIVE COOPERATIVITY; SUBTYPE SELECTIVITY; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; ACETYLCHOLINE; AGONIST; MEMORY; XANOMELINE; GALLAMINE; LIGANDS; PHARMACOLOGY	Current antipsychotics provide symptomatic relief for patients suffering from schizophrenia and related psychoses; however, their effectiveness is variable and many patients discontinue treatment due to side effects. Although the etiology of schizophrenia is still unclear, a leading hypothesis implicates an imbalanced dopaminergic system. Muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptors regulate dopamine levels in key areas of the brain involved in psychosis, with the M-4 subtype emerging as a key regulator of dopaminergic hyperactivity. Unfortunately, no selective small molecule tools exist to provide pharmacological validation of this hypothesis. Here, we describe the discovery of a small molecule modulator, LY2033298, that is highly selective for human M-4 receptors by virtue of targeting an allosteric site on this receptor. Pharmacological assays confirmed the selectivity of LY2033298 for the M-4 receptor and revealed the highest degree of positive allosteric enhancement of ACh potency thus far identified. Radioligand binding assays also show this compound to directly potentiate agonist binding while having minimal effects on antagonist binding. Mutational analysis identified a key amino acid (D-432) in the third extracellular loop of the human M-4 receptor to be critical for selectivity and agonist potentiation by LY2033298. Importantly, LY2033298 was active in animal models predictive of clinical antipsychotic drug efficacy indicating its potential use as a first-in-class, selective, allosteric muscarinic antipsychotic agent.

(Amaranthaceae) and Brugmansia arborea (L.) Lagerheim (Solanaceae) towards 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C serotononergic, D, and D-2 dopaminergic, a, and a, adrenergic receptors by radioligand assays. The results show weak affinity to 5-HT1A only for the aqueous extract of V. adscendens and no affinity for 5-HT2A, 5HT(2C) serotononergic receptors, alpha(1), and alpha(2) adrenergic receptors and D-2 receptors. As it regards D, receptors, only for the methanolic extract the IC50 value was determinable. The data obtained for 1. herbstii extracts have shown a low affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor (22.44%) and no affinity for 5-HT2A receptor. Otherwise these extracts showed affinity for 5-HT2C receptor but only for the methanolic extract the IC50 value (inhibitory concentration 50%) was: 34.8 mu g/ml. The B. arborea aqueous extract displayed weak affinity for all receptors tested, the highest levels of inhibition at the maximum concentration tested (125 mu g/ml) were 38% for the 5-HT1A, 16% for the 5-HT2A and 39% for the 5-HT2C receptor. The results of our experiments indicate that V. adscendens, Iresine herbstii and Brugmansia arborea were able to interact with the central 5-HT receptors thus confirming their ritual use.

B2R, a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, is a potential drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders, pain and inflammation. In this study, human B2R was expressed at high levels in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells using Semliki Forest virus-based vectors. The recombinant receptor was produced as a fusion protein with affinity tags and an expression level of 11 pmol/mg (i.e., approx. 0.2 mg of active receptor per liter of culture) was obtained. Radioligand binding analysis revealed that the recombinant receptor binds to its endogenous ligand bradykinin with high affinity (K-d=0.12 nM) and its pharmacological profile was similar to that of B2R in native tissues. Bradykinin-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphate was observed in BHK cells expressing the recombinant receptor, which indicated the activation of endogenous G alpha(q) protein by the recombinant B2R. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and immunogold staining revealed that the recombinant receptor was predominantly localized intracellularly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an affinity-tagged recombinant B2R been expressed at high levels in BHK cells and extensively characterized.

J	Garbán, HJ; Buga, GM; Ignarro, LJ				Garbán, HJ; Buga, GM; Ignarro, LJ			Estrogen receptor-mediated vascular responsiveness to nebivolol:: a novel endothelium-related mechanism of therapeutic Vasorelaxation	JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						estrogen receptor; nebivolol; nitric oxide; vascular endothelium; estrogen	NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; ESSENTIAL-HYPERTENSION; CARDIOVASCULAR-SYSTEM; FOREARM VASCULATURE; CORONARY-ARTERIES; BINDING-SITES; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; CELLS; RELAXATION; ANTAGONIST	Nebivolol is a highly selective and lipophilic beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist with vasodilating characteristics attributed mainly to endothelial generation of nitric oxide (NO). Coincidently, rapid vascular vasodilating effects of estradiol are also widely reported and membrane- initiated signaling by estrogen receptor (ER), leading to generation of NO, parallels the vasodilating effects observed for nebivolol. Thus, we hypothesized that the NO-dependent vasodilating effect attributed to nebivolol may be partially mediated through its interaction with the membrane-associated form of ER. The objective of this study was to examine the ER-mediated/endothelium-dependent vascular responses to nebivolol and the specific binding properties of nebivolol to ER. In isolated rat aortic rings, the endothelium-dependent vasodilating effect of nebivolol was significantly blocked by the use of the potent ER antagonist, ICI 182,780. In contrast, in the absence of intact endotbelium, nebivolol-induced vasorelaxation was not blocked by ICI 182,780, strongly suggesting that nebivolol-elicited vasorelaxation is partially dependent on ER-mediated pathways. Further, we examined the binding of nebivolol to ER (MCF-7 cells) by radioligand binding assay and revealed specific binding kinetics with an estimated DC50 of 5 x 10(-4) M, coinciding with the approximate EC50 of nebivolol as a vasorelaxant. In conclusion, the endothelium-dependent vascular response to nebivolol is attributed partially to its interaction with ER.

Histamine H-1-receptor antagonists completely block its effect. In the present study, we determined the involvement of histamine-receptor subtypes in this process. Materials and methods:Radioligand-binding assay was used to establish the presence of histamine H-1- and H-2-receptors on new-born rat cortical astrocytes in primary culture. Histamine H-1-, H-2- and H-3/H-4-receptor ligands, and highly selective protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor were used to influence NGF secretion from cultured astrocytes. NGF, released into the culture medium, was measured by NGF-ELISA. Results:Histamine H-1-receptor agonists (histamine, selected histaprodifens) increased the secretion of NGF from cultured astrocytes in a concentration-dependent manner. H-1-receptor antagonists/inverse agonists (mepyramine, triprolidine) and PKC inhibitor completely blocked the effect of histamine. Histamine H-2- and H-3-receptor agonists did not enhance NGF secretion significantly. In addition, H-2- and H-3/H-4-receptor antagonists did not diminish histamine-stimulated NGF release. Conclusions:Our results indicate that histamine H-1-receptor and PKC are involved in the signal transduction pathway, responsible for histamine-stimulated NGF secretion from cultured astrocytes.

Displacement of [H-3]bremazocine by selective ligands for the mu (mu), delta (delta), and lappa (kappa) receptors revealed that only the delta -selective ligands could fully displace specific [H-3]bremazocine binding, indicating the presence of only the delta -receptor in these cells. Saturation binding studies with the delta -antagonist naltrindole afforded a B-max of 32 fmolsimg protein and a K-D value for [H-3]naltrindole of 0.46 nM. The binding affinities of various delta ligands for the receptor in HL-1 cell membranes obtained from competition binding assays were similar to those obtained using membranes from a neuroblastoma x glioma cell line, NG108-15. Finally, various delta -agonists were found to stimulate the binding of [S-35]GTP gammaS, confirming coupling of the cardiac delta -receptor to G-protein. DADLE (D-Ala-D-Leu-enkephalin) was found to be the most efficacious in this assay, stimulating the binding of [S-35]GTP gammaS to 27% above basal level. The above results indicate that the HL-1 cell line contains a functionally coupled delta -opioid receptor and therefore provides an in vitro model by which to study the direct effects of opioids on cardiac opioid receptors.

However, the precise mechanisms have not been determined. Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays crucial roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and neointimal formation after angioplasty. We examined the effect of PPAR gamma activators on the expression of Ang II type 1 receptor (AT(1)-R) in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Methods and Results-AT(1)-R mRNA and AT(1)-R protein levels were determined by Northern blot analysis and radioligand binding assay, respectively. Natural PPAR gamma ligand 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2), as well as Tro, reduced the AT(1)-R mRNA expression and the AT(1)-R protein level. The PPAR gamma activators also reduced the calcium response of VSMCs to Ang II. PPAR gamma activators suppressed the AT(1)-R promoter activity measured by luciferase assay but did not affect the AT(1)-R MRNA stability, suggesting that the suppression occurs at the transcriptional level. Conclusions-PPAR gamma activators reduced the AT(1)-R expression and calcium response to Ang II in VSMCs, Downregulation of AT(1)-R may contribute to the inhibition of neointimal formation by PPAR gamma activators.

A relative potent binding inhibition was observed for dopamine D-2 and opioid (mu and kappa subtype) receptors with IC50 values of the native extract between 20 and 70 mg/mL. Binding, neither to the histamine H-1, benzodiazepine and OFQ receptor, nor to the binding-site of the serotonin (5-HT) transporter, was significantly inhibited. The lipophilic fractions contained the diterpenes rotundifuran and 6 beta ,7 beta -diacetoxy-13-hydroxy-labda-8,14-dien. They exhibited inhibitory actions on dopamine D-2 receptor binding. While binding inhibition to mu and kappa opioid receptors was most pronounced in lipophilic fractions, binding to delta opioid receptors was inhibited mainly by a aqueous fraction. Standardised Ze 440 extracts of different batches were of constant pharmacological quality according to their potential to inhibit the binding to D-2 receptors. In superfusion experiments, the aqueous fraction of a methanolic extract inhibited the release of acetylcholine in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, the potent D-2 receptor antagonist spiperone antagonised the effect of the extract suggesting a dopaminergic action mediated by D-2 receptor activation. Our results indicate a dopaminergic effect of Vitex agnus-castus extracts and suggest additional pharmacological actions via opioid receptors.

In order to fulfill the increasing clinical demand of an F-18-labeled SV2A PET ligand, we have developed a fully automated procedure to provide a sterile and pyrogen-free good manufacturing procedure (GMP)-compliant product of [F-18]SynVesT-1 suitable for clinical studies in humans. [ [F-18]SynVesT-1 is synthesized via a rapid copper-mediated radiofluorination protocol. The procedure was developed and established on a commercially available module, TracerMaker (ScanSys Laboratorieteknik ApS, Copenhagen, Denmark), a synthesis platform originally developed to conduct carbon-11 radiochemistry. From similar to 130 GBq (end-of-bombardment), our newly developed procedure enabled us to prepare [F-18]SynVesT-1 in an isolated radioactivity yield of 14,220 +/- 800 MBq (n= 3), which corresponds to a radiochemical yield (RCY) of 19.5 +/- 0.5%. The radiochemical purity (RCP) and enantiomeric purity of each of the final formulated batches exceeded 98%. The overall synthesis time was 90 min and the molar activity was 330 +/- 60 GBq/mu mol (8.9 +/- 1.6 Ci/mu mol). The produced [F-18]SynVesT-1 was stable over 8 h at room temperature and is suitable for in vivo PET imaging studies in human subjects.

Compound 3j (6,7-dimethoxybenzofuran-2-yl)(3-methoxyphenyl) methanone exhibited A(1) affinity (A(1)K(i) (rat) = 6.880 mu M) as well as A(2A) affinity (A(2A)K(i) (rat) = 0.5161 mu M). Compounds 3a-b & 3i-k exhibited selective affinity towards A(1) with K-i values below 10 mu M. The results indicate that C6,7-diOCH(3) substitution on ring A in combination with meta (C3')-OCH3 substitution on ring B is beneficial for A(1) and A(2A )affinity and activity. Compounds 3a-b & 3j-k showed low cytotoxicity. Upon in vitro and in silico evaluation, compound 3j may be considered lead-like (i.e. a molecular entity suitable for optimization) and, thus, of value in the design of novel, potent and selective adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor antagonists.

In this prospective study, we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of 177Lutetium (Lu)-PSMA in metastatic castration-resistant PC (mCRPC) patients for the establishment and approval of this therapy in Iran. Fourteen mCRPC patients (mean age 70.57 +/- 7.3 years) were treated with a single dose of 177Lu-PSMA. Complete blood count, liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase), alkaline phosphatase levels, renal function tests (urea and creatinine), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were obtained for the patients at baseline and every 2 weeks. A majority of the patients (11 patients, 64.2%) experienced a decline in their PSA levels; in 5 (45.4%) of these patients, the PSA levels declined > 50%.The severity of pain decreased in 8 (57.1%) patients, and performance status was improved in 5 (45.4%) patients. The treatment was well tolerated, and no severe hematological or nonhematological side effects were observed. Our findings show that 177Lu-PSMA had a high efficacy and a low toxicity in an Iranian population and is a promising treatment option for PC patients.

One of the challenges in screening such compounds is to understand their mechanisms of action and define appropriate parameter estimates for affinity, cooperativity and efficacy. Herein we describe the mechanisms of action and structure activity relationships for a series of "pan-G(q)-coupled" muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). Using a combination of radioligand binding, functional inositol phosphate accumulation assays, receptor alkylation and operational data analysis, we show that most compounds in the series derive their variable potency and selectivity from differential cooperativity at the M-1, M-3 and M-5 mAChRs. None of the PAMs showed greater than 10-fold subtype selectivity for the agonist-free receptor, but VU6007705, VU6007678, and VU6008555 displayed markedly increased cooperativity compared to the parent molecule and M-5 mAChR-preferring PAM, ML380 (alpha beta > 100), in the presence of ACh. Most of the activity of these PAMs derives from their ability to potentiate ACh binding affinity at mAChRs, though VU6007678 was notable for also potentiating ACh signaling efficacy and robust allosteric agonist activity. These data provide key insights for the future design of more potent and subtype-selective mAChR PAMs.	[Berizzi, Alice E.; Sexton, Patrick M.; Langmead, Christopher J.; Christopoulos, Arthur] Monash Univ, Monash Inst Pharmaceut Sci, Drug Discovery Biol, Parkville, Vic 3052, Australia; [Bender, Aaron M.; Lindsley, Craig W.; Conn, P.

Interaction of Synthetic Human SLURP-1 with the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CHEMICAL-SYNTHESIS; EXPRESSION; PROTEINS; MODULATOR; PEPTIDE; BINDING; SYSTEM; LYNX1	Human SLURP-1 is a secreted protein of the Ly6/uPAR/three-finger neurotoxin family that co-localizes with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and modulates their functions. Conflicting biological activities of SLURP-1 at various nAChR subtypes have been based on heterologously produced SLURP-1 containing N- and/or C-terminal extensions. Here, we report the chemical synthesis of the 81 amino acid residue human SLURP-1 protein, characterization of its 3D structure by NMR, and its biological activity at nAChR subtypes. Radioligand assays indicated that synthetic SLURP-1 did not compete with [I-125]-alpha-bungarotoxin (alpha-Bgt) binding to human neuronal alpha 7 and Torpedo californica muscle-type nAChRs, nor to mollusk acetylcholine binding proteins (AChBP). Inhibition of human alpha 7-mediated currents only occurred in the presence of the allosteric modulator PNU120596. In contrast, we observed robust SLURP-1 mediated inhibition of human alpha 3 beta 4, alpha 4 beta 4, alpha 3 beta 2 nAChRs, as well as human and rat alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChRs. SLURP-1 inhibition of alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChRs was accentuated at higher ACh concentrations, indicating an allosteric binding mechanism. Our results are discussed in the context of recent studies on heterologously produced SLURP-1 and indicate that N-terminal extensions of SLURP-1 may affect its activity and selectivity on its targets. In this respect, synthetic SLURP-1 appears to be a better probe for structure-function studies.

We have here investigated the effect of the non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and of a Cannabis sativa extract with high (64.8%) content in THCV (THCV-BDS) on nitric oxide (NO) production, and on cannabinoid and transient receptor potential (TRP) channel expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated murine peritoneal macrophages. THCV-BDS and THCV exhibited similar affinity in radioligand binding assays for CBI and CB2 receptors, and inhibited, via CB2 but not CBI cannabinoid receptors, nitrite production evoked by LPS in peritoneal macrophages. THCV down-regulated the over-expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and interleukin 113 (IL-1 (3) proteins induced by LPS. Furthermore, THCV counteracted LPS-induced up-regulation of CBI receptors, without affecting the changes in CB2, TRPV2 or TRPV4 mRNA expression caused by LPS. Other TRP channels, namely, TRPA1, TRPVI, TRPV3 and TRPM8 were poorly expressed or undetectable in both unstimulated and LPS-challenged macrophages. It is concluded that THCV via CB2 receptor activation inhibits nitrite production in macrophages. The effect of this phytocannabinoid was associated with a down-regulation of CBI., but not CB2 or TRP channel mRNA expression. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Resin-supported arylstannanes as precursors for radiolabeling with iodine: benzaldehydes, benzoic acids, benzamides, and NHS esters	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						solid phase organic chemistry (SPOC); radiopharmaceuticals; iodobenzamides; N-succinimidyl benzoate; radioiodination	LITHIUM HALOGEN EXCHANGE; PHASE ORGANIC-CHEMISTRY; SOLID-PHASE; MALIGNANT-MELANOMA; CELLULAR UPTAKE; N-SUCCINIMIDYL; IMAGING AGENT; IN-VITRO; REAGENTS; DERIVATIVES	A highly cross-linked polystyrene resin bearing a reactive chlorostannane moiety 1 has been used to generate a variety of arylstannane radiopharmaceutical precursors for no-carrier-added radioiodination. The resins were characterized for their solvent compatibility and sensitivity to acid cleavage. Resin-supported arylstannanes synthesized via their aryllithium analogues include 3-and 4-stannylbenzaldehydes, 3-and 4-stannylbenzoic acids, and 3-and 4-N-succinimidyl benzoates. A three-step route to the resin-supported stannylbenzoic acids 12a/b was developed through resin-supported benzaldehydes 11a/b. The aldehyde to acid conversion efficiency is >90%, and acid loading capacities of 0.66-0.94 mmol/g were obtained. Resin-supported N-succinimidyl benzoates 16a/b were prepared from the acid with 78%-84% conversion efficiency. Libraries of resin-supported benzamides 19a/b prepared from amine conjugation to corresponding benzoic acids or N-succinimidyl benzoates are described. A third approach describes the preparation of resin-supported benzamides via direct conjugation of the dilithio salt of the intact benzamide to the chlorostannane resin 1. Lastly, as proof-of-principle, a radiolabeling study with iodine-131 (I-131) was performed with a resinsupported benzamide to afford the corresponding radioligand in moderate yields, and high radiochemical purity.

Investigating the mode of action of sulfoxaflor: a fourth-generation neonicotinoid	PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE			English	Article						Imidacloprid; resistance; pest management; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Myzus persicae; radiolabel	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; APHID MYZUS-PERSICAE; BINDING; RESISTANCE; INSECTICIDES; RADIOLIGAND; DINOTEFURAN; HEMIPTERA; ANALOGS; SITE	Background The precise mode of action of sulfoxaflor, a new nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-modulating insecticide, is unclear. A detailed understanding of the mode of action, especially in relation to the neonicotinoids, is essential for recommending effective pest management practices. Results Radiolabel binding experiments using a tritiated analogue of sulfoxaflor ([3H]-methyl-SFX) performed on membranes from Myzus persicae demonstrate that sulfoxaflor interacts specifically with the high-affinity imidacloprid binding site present in a subpopulation of the total nAChR pool. In competition studies, imidacloprid-like neonicotinoids displace [3H]-methyl-SFX at pM concentrations. The effects of sulfoxaflor on the exposed aphid nervous system in situ are analogous to those of imidacloprid and nitenpyram, and finally the high-affinity sulfoxaflor binding site is absent in a Myzus persicae strain (clone FRC) possessing a single amino acid point mutation (R81T) in the -nAChR, a region critical for neonicotinoid interaction. Conclusion The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pharmacological profile of sulfoxaflor in aphids is consistent with that of imidacloprid. Additionally, the insecticidal activity of sulfoxaflor and the current commercialised neonicotinoids is affected by the point mutation in FRC Myzus persicae. Therefore, it is suggested that sulfoxalfor be considered a neonicotinoid, and that this be taken into account when recommending insecticide rotation partnering for effective resistance management programmes.

We have developed a novel PDE10A PET ligand, F-18-JNJ42259152, and describe here its human dynamic biodistribution, safety and dosimetry. Six male subjects (age range 23-67 years) underwent ten dynamic whole-body PET/CT scans over 6 h after bolus injection of 175.5 +/- 9.4 MBq F-18-JNJ42259152. Source organs were delineated on PET/CT and individual organ doses and effective dose were determined using the OLINDA software. F-JNJ42259152 was readily taken up by the brain and showed exclusive retention in the brain, especially in the striatum with good washout starting after 20 min. The tracer was cleared through both the hepatobiliary and the urinary routes. No defluorination was observed. Organ absorbed doses were largest for the gallbladder (239 mu Sv/MBq) and upper large intestine (138 mu Sv/MBq). The mean effective dose was 24.9 +/- 4.1 mu Sv/MBq. No adverse events were encountered. In humans, F-18-JNJ42259152 has an appropriate distribution, brain kinetics and safety. The estimated effective dose was within WHO class IIb with low interindividual variability. Therefore, the tracer is suitable for further kinetic evaluation in humans.

In this study, a new bombesin analogue was labeled with Tc-99m via HYNIC and tricine/EDDA as coligands and investigated further. HYNIC-GABA-Bombesin (7-14) NH2 was synthesized using a standard Fmoc strategy. Labeling with Tc-99m was performed at 100 A degrees C for 10 min and radiochemical analysis involved ITLC and HPLC methods. The stability of radiopeptide was checked in the presence of humane serum at 37 A degrees C up to 24 h. The receptor bound internalization and externalization rates were studied in GRP receptor expressing PC-3 cells. Biodistribution of radiopeptide was studied in nude mice bearing PC-3 tumor. Labeling yield of > 98% was obtained corresponding to a specific activity of similar to 2.6 MBq/nmol. Peptide conjugate showed good stability in the presence of human serum. The radioligand showed high and specific internalization into PC-3 cells (14.63 +/- A 0.41% at 4 h). In biodistribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake was observed in GRP-receptor-positive organs so that after 4 h the uptakes in mouse tumor and pancreas were 1.31 +/- A 0.18 and 1.2 +/- A 0.13% ID/g, respectively.

Using brain tissue from rats obtained at postnatal days 1, 10, 25, and >25 (adult), the binding of [H-3]gaboxadol and the benzodiazepine [H-3]flunitrazepam to GABAA receptors was compared in homogenate binding assays and quantitative receptor autoradiography. Kinetic and equilibrium data obtained in homogenate binding studies revealed two different [H-3]gaboxadol affinities. A kinetically derived K-D of 3.7 nM in adult cerebellum, calculated from the association and dissociation rate constants k(on) ( 1.45 X 108 M-1 min(-1)) and kff (0.54 min(-1)) was contrasted by an equilibrium K-D of 38.6 nM, obtained by homologous competition experiments. Quantitative analysis of autoradiographic data revealed an increase in specific [H-3] gaboxadol binding sites during brain development, which resembles the anatomical and temporal pattern of the postnatal expression of the extrasynaptic delta subunit of GABA(A) receptors. In conclusion, by the radioligand binding data obtained on native tissue, binding of gaboxadol to GABA(A) receptors located outside the synaptic junctions could be postulated. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

[(11)]FR194921 was successfully synthesized in 19 min after [C-11]CH3I formation. The radiochemical yield was 38 +/- 3%; and radioactivity was 4.1 +/- 0.4 GBq, calculated from end of synthesis; radiochemical purity was higher than 99%; and the specific radioactivity was 25.0 +/- 8.1 GBq mu mol(-1) (n =5). In a rat experiment, the distribution of [C-11]FR194921 was higher in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum regions. This accumulation was significantly decreased by approximately 50% by pretreatment with 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an adenosine A(I) receptor antagonist, which indicated specific binding of the radioligand to adenosine A, receptors. In conscious monkey PET experiments, [C-11]FR194921 accumulated in several regions of the brain, especially in the occipital cortex, thalamus and striatum. These results suggest that [C-11]FR194921 can be used as an agent for imaging adenosine A, receptors in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To facilitate easy detection and purification, a FLAG tag was introduced at the N-terminal, a c-myc epitope and a hexahistidine tag were introduced at the C-terminal of the CB1. In membrane preparations of CB1 gene transformed yeast cells, Western blot analysis detected the expression of CB1 proteins. Radioligand binding assays demonstrated that the tagged CB1 receptors expressed in P. pastoris have a pharmacological profile similar to that of the untagged CB1 receptors expressed in mammalian systems. Furthermore, the tagged CB1 receptors were purified by anti-FLAG M2 affinity chromatography and the identity of the purified CB1 receptor proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis. MALDI/TOF mass spectrometry analysis of the peptides extracted from tryptic digestions of purified CB1 preparations detected 17 peptide fragments derived from the CB1, thus further confirming the identity of the purified receptor. In conclusion, these data demonstrated for the first time that epitope tagged, functional CB1 cannabinoid receptors can be expressed in P. pastoris for purification and mass spectrometry characterization.

Immunoglobulin A (IgA) and G (IgG) anti-tTG were measured in radioligand binding assays and compared with conventionally analysed IgA antibodies against gliadin (AGA) and IgA autoantibodies against endomysium (EMA) in 48 DS patients. HLA-DQB1 typing was carried out by polymerase chain reaction and hybridization with allele-specific probes in 41/48 patients. Both IgA-tTG and IgG-tTG, as well as EMA, were detected in 7/48 and AGA in 15/48 patients. Intestinal biopsy showed histopathological changes consistent with CD in 9/16 patients. HLA-DQB1 typing, available for 8/9 patients with and for 33/39 without CD, demonstrated that 5/8 with CD had DQB1*02 compared with 7/33 of those without (p = 0.0345). In patients with anti-tTG. 5/6 had the DQB1*02 allele compared with 7/35 of those without (P = 0.0053). Conclusions: Anti-tTG are HLA-DQB1*02-associated autoantibodies which together could be useful screening tests for silent CD in DS patients. In patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or clinical signs of malabsorption. anti-tTG should be combined with AGA to detect other forms of enteropathies and CD.

Following intravenous injection of [C-11]KW-6002, radioactivity was measured in blood, plasma, peripheral tissues, and in discrete brain tissues over a 2-h time period commensurate with PET scanning, In brain, [C-11]KW-6002 showed highest retention in striata, with evidence of saturable binding, and lowest retention in frontal cortex (a tissue low in adenosine A(2A) receptors). PET scanning with [C-11]KW-6002 demonstrated a specific signal in the striata which could be described using compartmental modelling. Specific binding was, however, also detected in extrastriatal regions, including brain areas reported to have low adenosine A(2A) receptor density. Blocking studies with the A(1) selective antagonist KF15372 and the non xanthine-type A2A antagonist ZM 241385 failed to elucidate the nature of this binding. Thus, although [C-11]KW-6002 shows some potential for development as a PET ligand for quantifying striatal adenosine A(2A) receptor function, its in vivo selectivity requires further investigation.

Its expression is almost entirely restricted to the mushroom bodies, centres for learning and memory in the insect brain. This G-protein coupled receptor is present in relatively low concentrations in the locust brain (35 fmol/mg protein). The pharmacological characterisation reveals high affinity for the putative natural agonist dopamine (K-i = 28 nM). Substances with high subtype specificity for vertebrate dopamine receptors such as SCH 23390 (K-i = 639 nM) and sulpiride (K-i = 21,200 nM) have low affinity for the locust neuronal dopamine receptor. In opposite, substances with a broad pharmacological profile such as LSD, spiperone (K-i = 7.26 nM), and chlorpromazine (K-i = 9.52 nM) have high affinity properties. Comparison of the pharmacological data reveals no significant homology to any vertebrate dopamine receptor class characterised so far. This uncertainty about the pharmacological relatedness of insect dopamine receptors mirrors the available molecular data. It is almost impossible to classify cloned insect dopamine receptors into vertebrate dopamine receptor schemes. This lack of pharmacological relatedness opens the opportunity to develop highly specific insecticides against insect dopamine receptors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

An animal model of excessive Glu release in the brain was produced by intraperitoneally implanting an Alzet osmotic pump containing N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an activator of the cysteine/Glu antiporter, into the abdomen of rats. Basal Glu concentration in the brain was measured by microdialysis, which showed that basal Glu concentration in NAC-treated rats (0.31 mu M) was higher than that in saline-treated rats (0.17 mu M) at day 7 after the implantation of the osmotic pump. Similarly, PET studies with [C-11]ITDM, a useful radioligand for mGluR1 imaging exhibited that the striatal binding potential (BPND) of [C-11]ITDM for mGluR1 in PET assessments was increased in NAC-treated animals at day 7 after implantation (2.30) compared with before implantation (1.92). The dynamic changes in striatal BPND during the experimental period were highly correlated with basal Glu concentration. In conclusion, density of mGluR1 is rapidly upregulated by increases in basal Glu concentration, suggesting that mGluR1 might to be a potential biomarker of abnormal conditions in the brain.

Here global forebrain ischemia was created in anesthetized rats and aggravated with the induction of spreading depolarizations (SDs) and subsequent short hypoxia before reperfusion. Drugs (DMT, the selective Sig-1R agonist PRE-084, the Sig-1R antagonist NE-100, or the serotonin receptor antagonist asenapine) were administered intravenously alone or in combination while physiological variables and local field potential from the cerebral cortex was recorded. Neuroprotection and the cellular localization of Sig-1R were evaluated with immunocytochemistry. Plasma and brain DMT content was measured by 2D-LC-HRMS/MS. The affinity of drugs for cerebral Sig-1R was evaluated with a radioligand binding assay. Both DMT and PRE-084 mitigated SDs, counteracted with NE-100. Further, DMT attenuated SD when co-administered with asenapine, compared to asenapine alone. DMT reduced the number of apoptotic and ferroptotic cells and supported astrocyte survival. The binding affinity of DMT to Sig-1R matched previously reported values. Sig-1Rs were associated with the perinuclear cytoplasm of neurons, astrocytes and microglia, and with glial processes. According to these data, DMT may be considered as adjuvant pharmacological therapy in the management of acute cerebral ischemia.

The importance of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) became generally recognized due to its physical link through anchor proteins with NMDAR. Neuroinflammation as well as the kynurenine (tryptophan catabolite; TRYCAT) pathway are equally considered as major contributors to the pathology. We aimed to investigate this interplay between glutamate release, neuronal activation and inflammatory markers, by using small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) in a rat model known to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms. Daily intraperitoneal injection of MK801 or saline were administered to induce the model together with N-Acetyl-cysteine (NAc) or saline as the treatment in 24 male Sprague Dawley rats for one month. Biweekly in vivo [C-11]-ABP688 microPET was performed together with mGluR5 immunohistochemistry. Simultaneously, weekly in vivo [F-18]-FDG microPET imaging data for glucose metabolism was acquired and microglial activation was investigated with biweekly in vivo [F-18]-PBR111 scans versus OX42 immunohistochemistry. Finally, plasma samples were analyzed for TRYCAT metabolites.

These mutant muscarinic receptors are unable to bind acetylcholine (ACh), the endogenous muscarinic receptor ligand, but can be efficiently activated by clozapine-N-oxide (CNO), an otherwise pharmacologically inert compound. These CNO-sensitive designer GPCRs (alternative name: designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug/DREADDs) have proven highly useful to explore the in vivo roles of distinct G protein signaling pathways in specific cell types or tissues. Like native GPCRs, CNO-activated DREADDs do not only couple to heterotrimeric G proteins but can also recruit proteins of the arrestin family (arrestin-2 and -3). Many studies have shown that arrestins can act as scaffolding proteins to promote signaling through G protein-independent pathways. To develop a novel tool useful for studying the physiological relevance of these arrestin-dependent signaling pathways, we recently described the development of an M-3 muscarinic receptor-based DREADD that is no longer able to couple to G proteins but can recruit arrestins and initiate arrestin-mediated signaling in a CNO-dependent fashion. In this chapter, we provide protocols useful for the pharmacological and functional characterization of this newly developed DREADD. These protocols can be applied more generally to all other members of the DREADD receptor family.

Aiming at improved selectivity for the H4R, the imidazole ring in imbutamine was methyl-substituted or replaced by various differently substituted heterocycles (1,2,3-triazoles, 1,2,4-triazoles, pyridines, pyrimidines) as potential bioisosteres. Investigations in [S-35] GTP gamma S binding assays using membranes of Sf9 insect cells expressing the respective human histamine receptor subtype revealed only very weak activity of most of the synthesized hetarylalkylamines at both receptors. By contrast, the introduction of substituents at the 4-imidazolyl ring was most effective regarding H4R selectivity. This holds for methyl substitution in position 2 and, especially, in position 5. 5-Methylimbutamine (H4R: EC50 = 59 nM, alpha = 0.8) was equipotent with imbutamine at the hH(4)R, but revealed about 16-fold selectivity for the hH(4)R compared to the hH(3)R (EC50 980 nM, alpha = 0.36), whereas imbutamine preferred the hH(3)R. The functional activities were in agreement with radioligand binding data. The results support the hypothesis that, by analogy with histamine, methyl substitution in histamine homologs offers a way to shift the selectivity in favor of the H4R.

The antagonistic potency of these compounds was tested by Ca2+ influx assays on cells expressing the h alpha 7 or h alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR subtype. To determine the inhibitory mechanisms, additional radioligand binding experiments were performed. The results indicate that the methiodides present the highest affinities for the flea nAChR agonist sites, while the same compounds bind preferably to the h alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR ion channel domain. These results indicate that the methiodides are competitive antagonists of the h alpha 7 nAChR but noncompetitive antagonists of the h alpha 4 beta 2 subtype. Docking and molecular dynamics simulations showed that the methiodide derivative 8d binds to the h alpha 7 orthosteric binding sites by forming stable cation-pi interactions between the quaternized quinulinuim moiety and the aromatic box in the receptor, whereas compounds 7j and 8j block the h alpha 4 beta 2 AChR ion channel by interacting with a luminal domain formed between the serine (position 6') and valine (position 13') rings that overlaps the imipramine binding site.

There are predictable seasonal patterns in both circulating CORT and immune function across many animal species, but whether CORT receptor density in immune tissues varies seasonally is currently unknown. Using radioligand binding assays, we examined changes in concentrations of glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) in spleen and skin in wild-caught house sparrows in Massachusetts during six different life-history stages: moult, early winter, late winter, pre-egg-laying, breeding and late breeding. Splenic GR and MR binding were highest during the pre-laying period. This may help animals respond to immune threats through increased lymphocyte proliferation and/or an increase in delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions, both of which CORT can stimulate and in which spleen is involved. A decrease in splenic GR and MR during the late breeding period coincides with low baseline and stress-induced CORT, suggesting immune function in spleen may be relatively CORT-independent during this period. We saw no seasonal patterns in GR or MR in skin, suggesting skin's response to CORT is modulated primarily via changes in circulating CORT titres and/or via local production of CORT in response to wounding and other noxious stimuli.

The compounds were designed, synthesized, and characterized by spectral data (IR, H-1 NMR, and MS) and the purity was ascertained by microanalysis. The D-2 and 5-HT2A affinity of the synthesized compounds was screened in vitro by radioligand displacement assays on membrane homogenates isolated from rat striatum and rat cortex, respectively. Furthermore, all the synthesized final compounds (10a-g; 11a-g; 12a-g) were screened for their in vivo pharmacological activity in Swiss albino mice. D-2 antagonism studies were performed using climbing mouse assay model and 5-HT2A antagonism studies were performed using quipazine-induced head twitches in mice. It was observed that none of the new chemical entities exhibited catalepsy and 12d, 11f, and 10a were found to be the most active compounds with 5-HT2A/D-2 ratio of 1.23077, 1.14286, and 1.12857, respectively, while the standard drug risperidone exhibited 5-HT2A/D-2 ratio of 1.0989. Among the twenty one new chemical entities, three compounds (12d, 11f, and 10a) were found to exhibit better atypical antipsychotic activity as they were found to have higher Meltzer index than the standard drug risperidone.

Binding assays seem to be more prone to this attractive format because no functional biological activity is taking place but instead a biophysical process, whose dynamics seem easier to control without introducing significant alterations, is happening. Therefore, single-addition assays based on the displacement of prebound labeled ligands can be conceived, but careful kinetic considerations must still be taken to maximize the sensitivity of the assay and to avoid jeopardizing the identification of compounds with slow-binding kinetics. This article shows the development of a single-addition, displacement-based binding assay intended to identify modulators that act by binding to the gabapentin site of the ion channel regulatory protein alpha 2 delta 1. After studying the kinetics of gabapentin binding and the influence they might have on the assay sensitivity, the best conditions were identified, and the sensitivity was compared with that of the more classical two-additions competition-based assay. Although the present study focuses on alpha 2 delta 1 and its interaction with gabapentin, the rationale and the methodology followed are of broad purpose and can be applied to virtually every binding assay.

In the mammalian brain the 5-HT1A receptor is the most widespread serotonin receptor type, and is involved in various functions. Less is known about the distribution of 5-HT1A receptors in the avian species. Therefore, we analyzed serotonin 5-HT1A receptor binding sites in the pigeon brain using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography with the selective radioligand [H-3]-8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin ([H-3]-8-OH-DPAT). The receptor is differentially distributed throughout the pigeon brain. High levels of 5-HT1A receptors are found in the nucleus pretectalis (PT). Moderate densities were detected in the tectum, as well as in the telencephalic nidopallium and hyperpallium. Very low levels were found in the hippocampal formation, the amygdaloid complex, the basal ganglia, and several thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, local variations in 5-HT1A receptor densities support the concept of further subdivisions of the entopallium.

Jeffrey			Discovery of a Novel Chemical Class of mGlu<sub>5</sub> Allosteric Ligands with Distinct Modes of Pharmacology	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						mGlu(5); metabotropic; glutamate; allosteric; potentiator	GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR SUBTYPE-5; MODULATORS; SITE; 2-METHYL-6-(PHENYLETHYNYL)PYRIDINE; POTENTIATORS; ACTS; SAR	We previously discovered a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu(5)) termed 4 N-{4-chloro-2-[(1,3-dioxol,3-dihydro-2H-isoindo1-2-yl)methyl]pheny1}-2-hydroxy- benzamide (CPPHA) that elicits receptor activation through a novel allosteric site on mGlu(5), distinct from the classical mGlu(5) negative allosteric modulator (NAM) MPEP allosteric site. However, a shallow structure activity relationship (SAR), poor physio-chemical properties, and weak PAM activity at rat mGlu(5) limited the utility of CPPHA to explore allosteric activation of mGlu(5) at a non-MPEP site. Thus, we performed a functional high-throughput screen (HTS) and identified a novel mGlu(5) PAM benzamide scaffold, exemplified by VU0001850 (EC50 = 1.3 mu M, 106% Glu(max)) and VU0040237 (EC50 = 350 nM, 84% Glu(Max)). An iterative parallel synthesis approach delivered 22 analogues, optimized mGlu(5) PAM activity to afford VUO357121 (EC50 = 33 nM, 92% Glum(max)), and also revealed the first non-MPEP site neutral allosteric ligand (VUO365396). Like CPPHA, PAMs within this class do not appear to bind at the MPEP allosteric site based on radioligand binding studies. Moreover, mutagenesis studies indicate that VUO357121 and related analogues bind to a yet uncharacterized allosteric site on mGlu(5), distinct from CPPHA, yet share a functional interaction with the MPEP site.

Proteinaceous inclusions in Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), so-called Lewy bodies, also consist of fibrillar, misfolded proteins, chiefly alpha-synuclein. To test whether PDD subjects show specific amyloid binding in vivo and whether this could reflect fibrillar alpha-synuclein accumulation, we investigated 10 PDD subjects with [C-11]IPIB-PET. Radioligand binding was compared to that in 11 control and 6 AD subjects. Furthermore, postmortem sections of 4 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), therefrom 2 with dementia (PDD), and of 6 controls were stained with PIB to evaluate the histological distribution of the fluorescent ligand in the brainstem. In PET, only 2 PDD patients displayed increased PIB binding to cortical amyloid comparable to AD patients. The other 8 patients showed control-like cortical findings but elevated PIB binding in the pons and mesencephalon. Fluorescence microscopy showed PIB binding to Lewy bodies and neuromelanin in the substantia nigra of PD and PDD brainstem sections, but not in controls. These data suggest that PIB-PET can be used to further differentiate PDD with respect to cortical amyloid. Furthermore, we provide evidence that - in addition to nonspecific binding - PIB uptake in the brainstem may also reflect PDD related amyloid. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To investigate further, it is essential to show the precise location of H1R in the placenta. In the present study, we investigated H1R expression in human placenta by radioligand binding assay and immunohistochemical study using an antibody against human H1R. Placentas were obtained from normal uncomplicated deliveries. Membranes prepared from the tissue exhibited saturable [H-3]mepyramine binding (K-d = 4.0 +/- 0.6 nM and B-max = 91.4 +/- 4.9 fmol/mg of protein). Stereoisomers of chlorpheniramine inhibited [H-3]mepyramine binding; d-chlorpheniramine inhibited more potently than 1-chlorpheniramine, K-i values being 1.1 +/- 0.4 and 270 +/- 170 nM, respectively. The placenta tissues were positively immunostained with anti-H1R antibody only in the region of the syncytiotrophoblast of chorionic villus. The tissues were double stained with anti-H1R antibody and an antibody against human chorionic gonadotoropin (hCG) that is solely expressed in placental syncytiotrophoblast cells. The results showed that H1R and hCG were expressed on the same cells, that is, syncytiotrophoblast cells. These results indicate that H(1)Rs are specifically expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells of human placenta organ.

Kinetics experiments, however, may be distorted by the time course of drug penetration into even so simple a "tissue" as the monolayer. The impediments include unstirred layers both above and between the cells, the congregation of receptors within the confined space between cells, and nonspecific binding to membrane components. The contributions of these factors were investigated in cultures of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells either nontransfected or stably transfected with It opioid receptors. The dissociation of [H-3]naloxone was four times faster under displacement than under infinite dilution conditions, clearly demonstrating the "retention effect" of receptors confined in space. Even the penetration of this ligand between nontransfected cells showed salient delays with respect to diffusion into a slab, indicating that nonspecific, low-affinity binding to membrane components was arresting its progress. The optical sectioning capabilities of confocal microscopy demonstrated that the kinetics of two fluorescent antagonists depended on the vertical plane, providing direct evidence for slowed diffusion down a single cell depth. Modeling shows that kinetic errors increase with receptor density forward rate constant, and the thickness of the unstirred layer.

Methods: Alpha, adrenoceptor sites were measured by radioligand binding in three cortical regions of 46 individuals with dementia and 33 elderly normal controls together with cortical noradrenaline concentration and locus coeruleus cell and neurofibrillary tangle counts. Results: The a, adrenergic receptor density was unaltered in patients with Alzheimer's disease, mixed/other dementias compared with controls; however, there was a loss of locus coeruleus cells in subjects with dementia, reaching 50% within the rostral nucleus. In addition, a significant reduction was seen in the midtemporal cortical noradrenaline concentration (31% decrease.) in patients with Alzheimer's disease. In subjects with dementia, there was a positive correlation between aggressive behavior and magnitude of rostral locus coeruleus cell loss, while the reduction in noradrenaline concentration correlated with cognitive impairment. Conclusions: Subgroups of patients with Alzheimer's disease may have different neurochemical changes from patients lacking these changes. Therefore, this study may have implications for the treatment of behavioral and psychiatric signs and symptoms in dementia, particularly aggressive behavior in patients with dementia.

ICYP binding to intact equine lymphocytes was rapid, saturable (maximal number of binding sites 320 +/- 20 ICYP binding sites/cell, n = 12) and of high affinity (K-D value for ICYP 14.4 +/- 1.7 pmol/l, n = 12). Binding was stereospecific as shown by the 10 times greater potency of (-)-propranolol to inhibit binding than its (+)-isomer. beta -adrenoceptor agonists inhibited ICYP binding with an order of potency: (-)-isoprenaline >(-)-adrenaline >(-)-noradrenaline; the same order of potency was obtained for agonist-induced stimulation of lymphocyte cyclic AMP content. The selective beta (2)-adrenoceptor antagonist ICI 118,551 was about 1000 times more potent in inhibiting ICYP binding than was the beta (1)-selective adrenoceptor antagonist CGP 20712A. It is, therefore, concluded that in intact equine lymphocytes, ICYP labels a class of functional beta -adrenoceptors that belong predominantly (> 90%) to the beta (2)-adrenoceptor subtype; a small (< 10%) beta (1)-adrenoceptor component, however, cannot be ruled out completely. ICYP binding to equine lymphocytes might be a suitable model to study function and regulation of the beta -adrenoceptor system in the horse in vivo. The aim of this study was to characterise the P-adrenoreceptor subtypes present on equine lymphocytes.

One important goal of PET in drug development is assessing the occupancy of various molecular targets (e.g., receptors, transporters, enzymes) by exogenous drugs. The current linear mathematical approaches used to determine occupancy using PET imaging experiments are presented. These algorithms use results from multiple regions with different target content in two scans, a baseline (pre-drug) scan and a post-drug scan. New mathematical estimation approaches to determine target occupancy, using maximum likelihood, are presented. A major challenge in these methods is the proper definition of the covariance matrix of the regional binding measures, accounting for different variance of the individual regional measures and their nonzero covariance, factors that have been ignored by conventional methods. The novel methods are compared to standard methods using simulation and real human occupancy data. The simulation data showed the expected reduction in variance and bias using the proper maximum likelihood methods, when the assumptions of the estimation method matched those in simulation. Between-method differences for data from human occupancy studies were less obvious, in part due to small dataset sizes. These maximum likelihood methods form the basis for development of improved PET covariance models, in order to minimize bias and variance in PET occupancy studies.

The time-resolved fluorescence technique, quenching resonance energy transfer (QRET), relics on a single-labeled binding partner in combination with a soluble quencher. The quencher efficiently suppresses the luminescence of the unbound labeled ligand, whereas the luminescence of the bound fraction is not affected. This approach allows the development of cell-based screening assays in a simple and cost-effective manner. The authors have applied the technique to the screening of beta(2)-adrenoreceptor (beta(2)AR) antagonists and agonists in intact human embryonic kidney HEK293(i) cells overexpressing human beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. Two antagonists (propranolol, alprenolol) and 2 agonists (metaproterenol, terbutaline) for beta(2)AR were investigated in a displacement assay using europium(III)-labeled pindolol ligand. The assay Z' values ranged from 0.68 to 0.78, the coefficient of variation was less than 10%, and the K-i values were 19 nM for propranolol and alprenolol and 14 and 5.9 mu M for metaproterenol and terbutaline, respectively. The QRET technique with beta(2)AR was also applied to LOPAC compound library screening, yielding nearly error-free recognition of known binders. This simple and cost-effective technique can be readily adapted to laboratory and industrial-scale screening.

We provide here evidence from bioluminescence resonance energy transfer experiments that stimulation by chemokines does not influence the CCR2/CCR5 heterodimerization status. In addition, we show that the rate of radioligand dissociation from one unit of the heterodimer in "infinite" tracer dilution conditions is strongly increased in the presence of an unlabeled chemokine ligand of the other unit. These results demonstrate unambiguously that the interaction between heterodimer units is of allosteric nature. Agonists, but also some monoclonal antibodies, could promote such negative binding cooperativity, indicating that this phenomenon does not require the full conformational change associated with receptor activation. Finally, we show that G protein coupling is required for high-affinity binding of macrophage inflammatory protein-1 beta (CCL4) to CCR5 and that the dissociation from G proteins, after incubation with Gpp(NH)p, promotes the release of prebound radiolabeled chemokines with kinetics similar to those measured after the addition of an excess of unlabeled chemokines. These observations suggest that the association with G proteins probably participates in the negative cooperativity observed between receptor monomers. We propose that negative cooperativity within homo- and heterodimers of chemokine receptors and probably other G protein-coupled receptors will probably have major implications in their pharmacology in vivo and in the physiopathology of the diseases with which they are associated.

The brains of these rats were unilaterally lesioned with an intranigral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine. The lesioned animals were divided into three groups subject to their behavior after pharmacological challenges. Circling behavior was recorded after amphetamine, apomorphine, and L-DOPA challenge in order to predict lesion size. The spatial distribution of radioactivity after [F-18]FDOPA or [F-18]CFT injection in brain sections was determined with digital autoradiography. Regions of interest were left/right striatum, left/right substantia nigra, and cerebellum. The degree of unilateral lesion for each animal was confirmed by counting of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cell bodies. With both tracers the uptake in the lesioned side was lower than in the intact side in the striatum and in the substantia nigra. In conclusion, both tracers clearly demonstrated nigrostriatal dopaminergic hypofunction and correlated with the number of nigral dopaminergic neurons. However, [F-18]FDOPA showed a much higher unspecific uptake of radioactivity, due to extensive metabolism; therefore, this tracer was less sensitive than the transporter tracer [F-18]CFT to detect these defects.

Ang II modulates AT(1)R expression. Here, we determined if estrogen-induced down-regulation of adrenal AT(1)Rs involves modulation of adrenal Ang II. Female rats were ovariectomized (OVX) and injected with 17beta-estradiol benzoate (E-2; 40 mug/kg) or vehicle for 7 d. Adrenal Ang II was separated from other angiotensin peptides by HPLC and measured by RIA. Scatchard analysis of radioligand binding curves showed that E2 or captopril (Cap; 0.5 g/liter water) significantly reduced adrenal AT(1)R binding (maximum binding capacity) by 22% and 19%, respectively, compared with OVX (276+/-2.09 fmol/mg protein). E-2 and Cap lowered adrenal AngII levels by 39% and 21%, respectively, compared with OVX (4.10+/-0.44 pmol/g). E-2 caused no further reductions in adrenal AT(1)R binding or in Ang II levels in Cap-treated OVX rats. High-dose Ang II infusion (1000 ng/kg. min) increased adrenal Ang II levels by 71% and lowered AT(1)R binding by 18%. Under these infusion conditions, E-2 did not reduce adrenal Ang II or AT(1)R binding. No differences in AT(1)R affinity ( dissociation constant) were observed among groups. These data suggest that E-2 regulates the number of adrenal AT(1)R binding sites indirectly by modulating adrenal Ang II.

Lymphocytes hybridized for alpha (1A) receptor subtype represented approximately 30% of total lymphocytes, those hybridized for alpha (1B)- and alpha (1D)-receptor subtypes averaged 42 and 25% of total lymphocytes, respectively. 3 Cytospin centrifuged lymphocytes exposed to anti-alpha (1A)-, alpha (1B)- or alpha (1D)-receptor protein antibodies, developed specific immunostaining. Approximately 27% of total lymphocytes were immunoreactive for alpha (1A)-receptor protein, 40% displayed alpha (1B)-receptor protein immunoreactivity and 22% alpha (1D)-receptor protein immunoreactivity. Analysis of percentages as well as of lymphocyte morphology of in situ hybridized and immunolabelled lymphocytes suggests the co-expression of mRNA receptor signal and protein receptor immunostaining in the same lymphocyte. 4 The demonstration of both alpha (1)-adrenoceptor mRNA and receptor protein subtypes suggests that alpha (1)-adrenoceptors may have a role in regulating lymphocyte function. 5 The possibility of demonstrating receptor protein immunoreactivity in a small amount of blood, such as that required for preparing cytospin-centrifuged lymphocytes, may stimulate research to evaluate the role of these receptors in lymphocytes and to establish if assessment of lymphocyte alpha (1)-adrenoceptors may represent a marker of their status in health and disease.

The previously reported CMRI has demonstrated its great potential and scope of labeling for the radiosynthesis of radioiodine-labeled compounds. However, the reported protocols (using a small amount/volume of radioactivity) are practically not reproducible in large-scale CMRI, in which the radioactivity was usually provided in a bulk alkaline solution. A large amount of water and a strong base are incompatible with CMRI. To overcome these issues in large-scale CMRI, we have developed a simple protocol for large-scale CMRI. The bulk water was removed under a flow of inert gas at 110 degrees C, and the strong base (i.e., NaOH) was neutralized with an acid, pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate or p-toluenesulfonic acid. In the model reactions of [I-123]KX-1, a PARP-1 radioligand for Auger radiotherapy, radiochemical conversions were significantly improved after neutralization of the base, and the addition of additional acids was tolerated and favorable for the reactions. Using this protocol, [I-123] KX-1 was radiosynthesized from 20 mCi (0.74 GBq) of [I-123]iodide in high radiochemical yields, high radiochemical purity, and high molar activity. This protocol should be applicable to the radiosynthesis of other compounds with radioiodine via CMRI.

This study investigated the contribution of radiolabelled metabolites which potentially affect its quantification. Ex vivo high-performance liquid chromatography with a radio detector (radioHPLC) was used to evaluate the parent and radiometabolite fractions of [C-11]SMW139 in the brain and plasma of eleven mice. Twelve healthy humans underwent 90-min [C-11]SMW139 brain PET with arterial blood sampling and radiometabolite analysis. The volume of distribution was estimated by using one- and two- tissue compartment (TCM) modeling with single (V-T) and dual (V-Tp) input functions. RadioHPLC showed three major groups of radiometabolite peaks with increasing concentrations in the plasma of all mice and humans. Two radiometabolite peaks were also visible in mice brain homogenates and therefore considered for dual input modeling in humans. 2TCM with single input function provided V-T estimates with a wide range (0.10-10.74) and high coefficient of variation (COV: 159.9%), whereas dual input function model showed a narrow range of V-Tp estimates (0.04-0.24; COV: 33.3%). In conclusion, compartment modeling with correction for brain-penetrant radiometabolites improves the in vivo quantification of [C-11]SMW139 binding to P2X(7)R in the human brain.

Simple ammonium salts acting on sigma-1 receptors yield potential treatments for cancer and depression	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MOLECULAR-CLONING; BINDING; ANTAGONISTS; EXPRESSION; LIGANDS; MICE; DESENSITIZATION; TRANSPORTER; INHIBITOR; MECHANISM	Sigma-land sigma-2 receptors are emerging therapeutic targets. We have identified that simple ammonium salts bind to these receptors and are effective in vivo. Radioligand binding assays were used to obtain structure-activity relationships of these salts. MTS assays were performed to determine their effect on growth in MCF7 and MDA-MB-486 cells. Anticancer properties were tested in NMRI mice transplanted with a fragment of mouse adenocarcinoma (MAC13). Antidepressant activity was tested using the forced-swim test and tail suspension tests. Dipentylammonium (K-i 43 nM), tripentylammonium (K-i 15 nM) and trihexylammonium (K, 9 nM) showed high affinity for the sigma-1 receptor. Dioctanoylammonium had the highest affinity (K-50 0.05 nM); this also showed the highest affinity for sigma-2 receptors (K-i 13 nM). Dipentylammonium was found to have antidepressant activity in vivo. Branched-chain ammonium salts showed lower affinity. Bis(2-ethylhexyl)ammonium (K-50 29 mu M), triisopentylammonium (K-50 196 mu M) and dioctanoylammonium showed a low Hill slope, and fitted a 2-site binding model for the sigma-1 receptor. We propose this two-site binding can be used to biochemically define a sigma-1 receptor antagonist. Bis(2-ethylhexyl)ammonium and triisopentylammonium were able to inhibit the growth of tumours in vivo. Cheap, simple ammonium salts act as sigma-1 receptor agonists and antagonists in vivo and require further investigation.

A characteristic feature of Plks is their C-terminal polo-box domain (PBD). Pro-Leu-His-Ser-pThr (PLHS[pT])-the phosphopeptide inhibitor of the PBD of PlkI-induces apoptosis in cancer cells. However, because of the low cell membrane-penetration ability of PLHS[pT], new approaches are required to overcome these drawbacks. We therefore developed a vitamin E (VE) conjugate that is biodegradable by intracellular redox enzymes as an anticancer drug-delivery system. To ensure high efficiency of membrane penetration, we synthesized VE-S-S-PLHS[pT]KY (1) by conjugating PLHS[pT] to VE via a disulfide bond. We found that 1 penetrated cancer cell membranes, blocked cancer cell proliferation, and induced apoptosis in cancer cells through cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase. We synthesized a radiolabeled peptide (I-124-I), and the radioligand was evaluated in in vivo tumor uptake using positron emission tomography. This study shows that combination conjugates are an excellent strategy for specifically targeting Plk PBD. These conjugates have a dual function, with possible uses in anticancer therapy and tumor diagnosis.

Additionally, given the importance of the dog as a non-rodent species for predicting human safety during the drug development process, we cloned the dog CB2 receptor gene and characterized its in-vitro pharmacological properties in a recombinant expression system. A 1.1 kb dog peripheral cannabinoid receptor (dCB(2)) fragment encoding a 360 amino acid protein was cloned from dog spleen cDNA. Analysis of the cloned dCB(2) polypeptide sequence revealed that it shares between 76 and 82% homology with rat, mouse, human and predicted chimpanzee cannabinoid CB2 receptors. The dog CB2 receptor expressed in CHO cells displayed similar binding affinities for various synthetic and endogenous cannabinoids as compared to those measured for the human and rat cannabinoid CB2 receptors. However, these ligands exhibited altered functional potencies and efficacies for the dog cannabinoid CB2 receptor, which was also found to be negatively coupled to adenylate cyclase activity. These complex pharmacological differences observed across species for the cannabinoid CB2 receptor suggest that caution should be exerted when analyzing the outcome of animal efficacy and safety studies, notably those involving cannabinoid CB2 receptor targeting molecules tested in the dog.

The characteristics of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the seminal vesicle and epididymal and prostatic portion of vas deferens of 3 and 22-month-old rats were determined using an isolated muscle bath, radioligand receptor binding and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction techniques. Old rats had significantly higher body weight and lower testosterone than young rats. Although there was no significant age dependent difference in the properties of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the prostatic portion of vas deferens, the maximum contractile responses to phenylephrine, total alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density and mRNA expression of all 3 alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes were significantly lower in the seminal vesicle and epididymal portion of vas deferens of 22 vs 3-month-old rats. Age dependent differences in the molecular, biochemical and functional properties of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the rat seminal vesicle and vas deferens may indicate potential differences in the response to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists with aging.

Pharmacological characterization of a novel nonpeptide antagonist of the human gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor, NBI-42902	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							GNRH-ANTAGONISTS; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; PROSTATE-CANCER; BINDING-SITES; OPEN-LABEL; IN-VITRO; POTENT; IDENTIFICATION; ENDOMETRIOSIS; MULTICENTER	Suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by peptides that act at the GnRH receptor has found widespread use in clinical practice for the management of sex-steroid-dependent diseases (such as prostate cancer and endometriosis) and reproductive disorders. Efforts to develop orally available GnRH receptor antagonists have led to the discovery of a novel, potent nonpeptide antagonist, NBI-42902, that suppresses serum LH concentrations in postmenopausal women after oral administration. Here we report the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of this compound. NBI-42902 is a potent inhibitor of peptide radioligand binding to the human GnRH receptor (K-i = 0.56 nM). Tritiated NBI-42902 binds with high affinity (K-d = 0.19 nM) to a single class of binding sites and can be displaced by a range of peptide and nonpeptide GnRH receptor ligands. In vitro experiments demonstrate that NBI-42902 is a potent functional, competitive antagonist of GnRH stimulated IP accumulation, Ca2+ flux, and ERK1/2 activation. It did not stimulate histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells. Finally, it is effective in lowering serum LH in castrated male macaques after oral administration. Overall, these data provide a benchmark of pharmacological characteristics required for a nonpeptide GnRH antagonist to effectively suppress gonadotropins in humans and suggest that NBI-42902 may have clinical utility as an oral agent for suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.

Radioligand binding showed apelin receptors in rat and human heart and human large conduit vessels. The specific cell types expressing the receptor, however, have not been determined. Apelin, the cognate receptor ligand, is present in endothelial cells. However, the exact pathway of endothelial apelin synthesis and secretion is not known. We therefore investigated the cellular distribution of APJ receptor-like immunoreactivity (APJ-LI) in a range of human tissues using immunocytochemistry and fluorescent double staining confocal microscopy. The same techniques were applied to determine the intracellular localisation of apelin-like immunoreactivity (apelin-LI) in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). APJ-LI is present in endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes. Apelin-LI localises to secretory vesicles and the Golgi complex/endoplasmic reticulum of HUVECs. Apelin-LI does not co-localise with von Willebrand factor in Weibel-Palade bodies, suggesting synthesis of apelin via the constitutive pathway. The proximity of receptor and ligand in the human vasculature, together with evidence for local vascular apelin synthesis, suggests an important role for APJ/apelin as a paracrine cardiovascular regulator system.

The classical opioid prohormones can generate several bioactive peptides, and these divergent families of prohormones share a common well conserved ancestral opioid motif (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe). Evidence from pharmacological and molecular cloning studies indicates the presence of multiple isoforms of opioid ligands and receptors that are as yet uncharacterized. To identify potential new members we used the opioid motif as an anchor sequence and isolated two distinct isoforms (Xen-dorphins A and B) of an opioid prohormone from Xenopus laevis brain cDNA library. Xen-dorphin prohormones can generate multiple novel opioid ligands distinct from the known members of this family. Both isoforms are present in a wide variety of tissues including the brain. Two potential bioactive peptides, Xen-dorphin-1A and -1B, that were chemically synthesized showed opioid agonist activity in frog and rat brain membranes using a [S-35] GTPgammaS assay. Initial radioligand binding experiments demonstrated that Xen-dorphin-1B binds with high affinity to opioid receptor(s) and with potential preference to the kappa-opioid receptor subtype. Cloning of the Xen-dorphin prohormone provides new evidence for the potential presence of other members in the opioid peptide superfamily.

A(2A) selective adenosine receptors antagonists are promising new drugs for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, while A(3) selective adenosine receptors antagonists have been postulated as novel anti-inflammatory and antiallergic agents; recent studies also indicated a possible employment of these derivatives as antitumour agents. Lately different classes of compounds have been identified as potent A(2A) and A(3) antagonists. In this article we report the past and present efforts which led to development of more potent and selective A(2A) and A(3) antagonists. Our group has mainly worked on the pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine nucleus both as A(2A) and A(3) antagonists, aiming to improve the affinity, selectivity and the hydrophilic profile. In fact, we have synthesised several compounds endowed with high affinity and selectivity versus A(2A) adenosine receptors, as 2, 2a-c (K(i)A(2A) = 0.12-0.19 nM), or A(3) adenosine receptors, as 4p (KiA(3) = 0.01 nM) and 4q (K(i)A(3) = 0.04 nM).

The specific binding of [H-3]TIOT to duck cerebral cortical membranes was found to be rapid, stable, saturable, reversible, and of high affinity. Saturation analysis resulted in a linear Scatchard plot suggesting binding to a single class of receptor binding sites with high affinity (K-d = 19.5 nM) and high capacity (B-max = 356 fmol/mg protein). Competition studies showed the following relative rank order of potency of various HA receptor ligands to inhibit the [H-3]TIOT binding: antagonists, tiotidine much greater than ranitidine approximate to zolantidine greater than or equal to cimetidine much greater than mepyramine > thioperamide; agonists, HA greater than or equal to 4-methylHA > 2-methylHA > dimaprit much greater than Ralpha-methylHA. The biphasic nature of the displacement curve for HA and the effect of 5'-guanylimidodiphosphate indicate the coupling of the studied receptor to G-protein. It is suggested that HA receptors in the duck cerebral cortex labelled with [H-3]TIOT represent either avian-specific H-2-like HA receptors or a novel subtype of HA receptors, coupled to a signalling pathway other than the adenylyl cyclase/cyclic adenosine monophosphate one.

Adenosine receptors are involved in the homeostasis of the immune, cardiovascular, and central nervous systems, and adenosine agonists/antagonists; exert many similar effects. The affinity of flavonoids and other phytochemicals to adenosine receptors suggests that a wide range of natural substances in the diet may potentially block the effects of endogenous adenosine. We used competitive radioligand binding assays to screen flavonoid libraries for affinity and a computational CoMFA analysis of flavonoids to compare steric and electrostatic requirements for ligand recognition at three subtypes of adenosine receptors. Flavone derivatives, such as galangin, were found to bind to three subtypes of adenosine receptors in the gM range. Pentamethylmorin (K-i 2.65 muM) was 14- to 17-fold selective for human A(1) receptors than for A(1) and A(2A) receptors. An isoflavone, genistein, was found to bind to A(1) receptors. Aurones, such as hispidol (K-i 350 nM) are selective A(1) receptor antagonists, and, like genistein, are present in soy. The flavones, chemically optimized for receptor binding, have led to the antagonist, MRS 1067 (3,6-dichloro-2'.(isopropoxy)-4'-methylflavone), which is 200-fold more selective for human A(3) than A(1) receptors. Adenosine receptor antagonism, therefore, may be important in the spectrum of biological activities reported for the flavonoids.

The 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) inhibited both [H-3]batrachotoxinin binding to neurotoxin site 2 of the Na+ channel in rat cortical membranes (IC50 = 5-1 muM) and veratridine-stimulated Na+ influx into rat synaptosomes (EC50 = 20.8 muM). The 5-HT1A receptor agonist flesinoxan and the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide (WAY-100635) also displaced [H-3]batrachotoxinin binding with similar affinities to 8-OH-DPAT, but were much less effective in reducing veratridine-stimulated Na+ influx. All three serotonergic agents also increased [H-3]saxitoxin binding to neurotoxin site 1 of the Na+ channel. In contrast, none of these agents interacted with radioligand binding to N- or P/Q-type Ca2+ channels. These data show that 8-OH-DPAT directly interacts with voltage-sensitive Na+ channels to reduce Na+ influx so providing an additional mechanism to explain how it functions as a neuroprotectant.

The analysis of GPCRs in natural membranes is laborious, as established methods are almost exclusively cell culture-based and only a few methods for immobilization in a natural membrane outside the cell are known. Within this study, we present a one-step, fast and robust immobilization strategy of the GPCR glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R). GLP-1R was synthesized in eukaryotic lysates harboring endogenous endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes enabling the embedment of GLP-1R in a natural membrane. Interestingly, we found that these microsomes spontaneously adsorbed to magnetic Neutravidin beads thus providing immobilized membrane protein preparations which required no additional manipulation of the target receptor or its supporting membrane. The accessibility of the extracellular domain of membrane-embedded and bead-immobilized GLP-1R was demonstrated by bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using GLP-1R-specific monoclonal antibodies. In addition, ligand binding of immobilized GLP-1R was verified in a radioligand binding assay. In summary, we present an easy and straightforward synthesis and immobilization methodology of an active GPCR which can be beneficial for studying membrane proteins in general.

Tc-99m(CO)(3)-MPPDTF is a neutral and lipophilic complex, which was confirmed by paper electrophoresis and octanol/water partition coefficient (P = 27.0 +/- 1.4, n = 3), respectively. In vivo biodistribution indicated that this complex had moderate brain uptake (0.53 +/- 0.10% ID/g at 5 min and 0.42 +/- 0.02% ID/g at 120min) and good retention (about 80% of the activity was retained in the brain at 120min post-injection). Regional brain distribution study showed that hippocampus, where the 5-HT1A receptor density is high, had the highest uptake (0.60 +/- 0.02% ID/g at 5min p.i.) and the cerebellum, where the 5-HT1A receptor density is low, had the lowest uptake (0.10 +/- 0.02% ID/g at 5min p.i.). After blocking with 8-OH-DPAT, the hippocampus uptake was decreased obviously while the cerebellum uptake was increased slightly. This result indicates that Tc-99m(CO)(3)-MPPDTF complex has specific binding to 5-HT1A receptor. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanisms by which endogenous opioids contribute to the pathophysiology of RLS remain unknown. We have studied opioid receptor availability in 15 patients with primary RLS and 12 age-matched healthy volunteers using PET and [C-11]diprenorphine, a non-selective opioid receptor radioligand. Ligand binding was quantified by generating parametric images of volume of distribution (V-d) using a plasma-derived input function. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to localize mean group differences between patients and controls and to correlate ligand binding with clinical scores of disease severity. There were no mean group differences in opioid receptor binding between patients and controls. However, we found regional negative correlations between ligand binding and RLS severity (international restless legs scale, IRLS) in areas serving the medial pain system (medial thalamus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and orbitofrontal cortex). Pain scores (affective component of the McGill Pain Questionnaire) correlated inversely with opioid receptor binding in orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus. Our findings suggest that, the more severe the RLS, the greater the release of endogenous opioids within the medial pain system. We therefore discuss a possible role for opioids in the pathophysiology of RLS with respect to sensory and motor symptoms.

Here we examined the molecular basis of these alterations and whether these findings can be replicated in another cohort. Methods. Prefrontal cortex from depressed suicide victims and nonpsychiatric controls were obtained from the Lenhossek Human Brain Program, Budapest and the Maryland Brain Collection Program. [H-3]cyclic adenosine monophosphate binding and protein kinase A activity were determined by radioligand binding and enzymatic assay, respectively. Expression of catalytic and regulatory subunits was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Results: [H-3]cyclic adenosine monophosphate binding and total and endogenous protein kinase A activity were significantly decreased in membrane and cytosol fractions of prefrontal cortex of depressed suicide victims from the Budapest cohort, with a similar magnitude (33%- 40% reduction) as reported for the Maryland cohort. In both cohorts, selective reduction (36%- 41%) in mRNA and protein expression of the regulatory RIIbeta and the catalytic Cbeta was observed. Conclusions: Our results suggest abnormalities in [H-3]cyclic adenosine monophosphate binding and catalytic activity kinase A in brain of depressed suicide victims, which could be due to reduced expression of RIIbeta and Cbeta. These abnormalities in PKA may be critical in the pathophysiology of depression.

We have characterised rat retinal D4 receptors using the D4 selective radioligand [I-125] L-750667 which bound specifically and saturably to rat retinal membranes with high affinity (K-d 0.06+/-0.02 nM) and exhibited a D4 receptor pharmacology. Comparison of the binding kinetics of [I-125] L-750667 and [H-3] spiperone revealed B-max values of 134 +/- 27 fmol/mg and 219+/-47 fmol/mg respectively, indicating that the dopamine D4 receptor is a major component of D2-like dopamine receptors in the rat retina. Modulation of retinal cAMP levels by quinpirole was used to evaluate the functional relevance of rat retinal dopamine D4 receptors. Quinpirole (0.03-3 muM) produced a dose-related decrease of the light sensitive cAMP pool which was reversed by haloperidol, clozapine and the D4 selective antagonist, L-745870 with a rank order of potency suggesting that the quinpirole effect is due to activation of the dopamine D4 receptors. The D2 selective ligand L-741626 had no effect on the quinpirole response confirming that the D4 receptor is the major receptor subtype mediating dopamine induced suppression of adenylate cyclase in the retina.

To identify the receptor subtypes, we performed [(125) I]epibatidine autoradiography in the presence of cytisine or A-85380. By comparing these results with binding data from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with different combinations of rat nicotinic receptor subunits, we were able to quantify three distinct populations of [ (125) I]epibatidine binding sites with characteristics of alpha4beta2, alpha3beta2 and alpha3beta4 receptors. Although the predominant subtype in rat brain was alpha4beta2, non-alpha4beta2 binding sites were prominent in many regions. In the habenulo-peduncular system, cerebellum, substantia gelatinosa, and many medullary nuclei, alpha3beta4-like binding accounted for more than 40% of [I-125]epibatidine binding, and nearly all binding in superior cervical ganglion and pineal gland. Other regions enriched in alpha3beta4-like binding included locus ceruleus, dorsal tegmentum, subiculum and anteroventral thalamic nucleus. Regions enriched in alpha3beta2-like binding included the habenulo-peduncular system, many visual system structures, certain geniculate nuclei, and dopaminergic regions. The combination of autoradiography using a broad spectrum radioligand in the presence of selectivecompetitors, and data from binding to defined receptor subtypes in expression systems, allowed us to quantify the relative populations of these three subtypes.

However, the cellular distribution and the influence of endogenous serotonin (5-HT) on in vivo binding have not been fully examined. In this study, we investigated the effect of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-produced destruction of 5-HT neurons, reserpine-induced 5-HT depletion, and fenfluramine-induced 5-HT increase on [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 binding in vivo. There was no significant change in the uptake of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in the slice of 5-HT denervated rat brain except in the raphe nucleus, where 5-HT cell bodies exist. There was no obvious effect of enhanced 5-HT release by fenfluramine or decreased release by reserpine on [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 binding in the dissected brain region. No significant effect was observed in the time course of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in the hippocampus and frontal cortex measured by PET. These results indicated that the in vivo binding of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex mainly reflects postsynaptic 5-HT1A, receptor binding, and that this binding is not sensitive to endogenous 5-HT, Synapse 40:122-129, 2001, (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We studied a woman with severe progressive SOH with blood pressure unresponsive to the presser effects of alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists, We tested the hypothesis that a circulating factor in this patient interferes with vascular adrenergic neurotransmission. Preincubation of porcine pulmonary artery vessel rings with patient plasma produced a dose-dependent inhibition of vasoconstriction to phenylephrine in vitro, abolished vasoconstriction to direct electrical stimulation, and had no effect on nonadrenergic vasoconstrictive stimuli (endothelin-1), PGF-2 alpha (or KCl), Preincubation of vessels with control plasma was devoid of these effects. SOH plasma inhibited the binding of an alpha (1)-selective antagonist radioligand ([I-125]HEAT) to membrane fractions derived from porcine pulmonary artery vessel rings, rat liver, and cell lines selectively overexpressing human ARs of the alpha (1B) subtype but not other AR subtypes (alpha (1A) and alpha (1D)), We conclude that a factor in SOH plasma can selectively and irreversibly inhibit adrenergic ligand binding to alpha (1B) ARs, We propose that this factor contributes to a novel pathogenesis for SOH in this patient. This patient's syndrome represents a new disease entity, and her plasma may provide a unique tool for probing the selective functions of alpha (1)-ARs.

The present study investigated the effects of dexamethasone on P-AR density, high-affinity P-agonist binding, G(s)alpha and G(i)alpha protein expression, and cAMP responses in bovine tracheal smooth muscle (bTSM). Dexamethasone treatment of cultured bTSM cells increased total beta-AR density 1.6- to 1.9-fold as assessed by the saturation binding of [H-3]CGP-12177 and by displacement of radioligand binding with isoproterenol. Isoproterenol bound to the 6-AR at two sites, a high-affinity site with a density of 5.9 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein and a low-affinity site with a density of 16.9 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg protein. Dexamethasone increased both high- and low-affinity isoproterenol binding sites to 11.1 +/- 2.2 and 25.9 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg protein, respectively, without influencing agonist binding affinities. Dexamethasone also selectively increased G(s)alpha protein levels from 0.99 +/- 0.14 to 1.46 +/- 0.17 mu g/mg protein without affecting G(i)alpha levels. The net effect of these changes was a 1.8-fold increase in maximal isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation in dexamethasone-treated bTSM cells. These findings provide new insights into the corticosteroid regulation of P-adrenergic signaling pathways in airway smooth muscle.

The internalization of the wild-type (WT) rat GnRH-R, stop codon mutants, GnRH-R/TRH receptor (TRK-R) chimera, rat TRH-R, and catfish GnRH-R was examined using radioligand binding assay. Overexpression of beta-arrestin in COS-7 cells expressing each of the receptor constructs substantially increased endocytosis rate constants (k(e)) of the TRH-R, catfish GnRH-R, and GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera, but not of the WT rat GnRH-R and stop codon mutants. The beta-arrestin-promoted increase in the k(e) value was diminished by co- transfecting cells with the dominant negative beta-arrestin-(319-418) mutant, whereas WT GnRH-R and stop codon mutant internalization were unaffected. Additionally, confocal microscopy showed that activated GnRH-Rs failed to induce time-dependent redistribution of either beta-arrestin-1- or beta-arrestin-2-green fluorescent protein conjugate to the plasma membrane. However, the dominant negative dynamin (DynK44A) mutant impaired internalization of all of the receptors regardless of their p-arrestin dependency, indicating that they internalize via a clathrin-mediated pathway. We conclude that the mammalian GnRH-R uses a beta-arrestin-independent, dynamin-dependent internalization mechanism distinct from that employed by the other receptors studied.

In all NSCLC patients, it is estimated that 50%-60% are programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive, and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies have shown their clinical application prospects in advanced NSCLC. To avoid unnecessary adverse effects and provide anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy to the most appropriate patient population, the PD-L1 expression in patients preparing for treatment must be evaluated accurately and in real time. In this study, we noninvasively evaluate the PD-L1 expression in an NSCLC xenograft using I-124-labeled F(ab ')(2) fragments of durvalumab (Durva) and compared it with the I-124-labeled intact antibody in terms of the biodistribution and dosimetry. The aim is to develop a nuclide labeled molecular probe with better performance for PD-L1 immunoPET imaging. After cleaving using IdeS protease, the F(ab ')(2) fragments of Durva were labeled with I-124. The radioligand showed a high radiochemical purity (>96%) and outstanding stability. Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry were performed on the two selected NSCLC cell lines to measure the in vitro PD-L1 expression. The H460 cells showed a much higher PD-L1 expression than the A549 cells, both at the protein level and the mRNA level. In the following cell binding experiment and binding specificity assay, the labeled radioligand showed good affinity to high PD-L1 expression cells and could be blocked with excess unlabeled intact Durva. The results of the biodistribution and the positron emission tomography (PET) image showed that the peak tumor uptake of I-124-Durva-F(ab ')(2) was close to I-124-Durva, but much earlier (5.29 +/- 0.42% ID/g for I-124-Durva-F(ab ')(2) at 12 h vs 5.18 +/- 0.73% ID/g for I-124-Durva at 48 h). Compared with I-124-Durva, an accelerated blood clearance was observed for I-124-Durva-F(ab ')(2). The faster blood clearance allowed for a higher tumor-to-background ratio, which was reflected on the image in contrast. The H460 tumors showed excellent contrast as early as 4 h after injection with I-124-Durva-F(ab ')(2), and for I-124-Durva, the xenograft could not be distinguished clearly until 24 h after injection. Interestingly, I-124-Durva-F(ab ')(2) showed lower accumulations compared to other metal isotopes labeled PD-L1 antibodies in bone, liver, spleen etc., which will be beneficial for metastasis detection. Another benefit of accelerated blood clearance was a reduction in the radiation dose. According to the results of the OLINDA/EXM, the effective dose for the total body of I-124-Durva was 4.25-times greater than that of I-124-Durva-F(ab ')(2) (186 mu Sv/MBq vs 43.8 mu Sv/MBq). All of these data indicated that I-124-Durva-F(ab ')(2) is a promising immunoPET tracer for evaluating the in vivo PD-L1 levels in an NSCLC model and is expected to be successful in future clinical application.

For this purpose, new highly sensitive AO' tracers were designed by regulating the position and number of nitrogen atoms. A series of derivatives of florbetapir (AV45) containing different numbers and positions of N atoms were synthesized and evaluated for in vitro affinity and in vivo biodistribution. Preliminary study results showed that [18F]BIBD-124 and [18F]BIBD-127 had better clearance rates and less in vivo defluorination than AV45 in ICR (ICR = Institute of Cancer Research) mice. Autoradiography and molecular docking indicated that the binding sites of [18F]BIBD-124/127 were similar to that of [18F]AV45. Micro-positron emission tomography-computed tomography imaging further demonstrated that [18F]BIBD-124 could monitor AO' plaques similar to [18F]AV45. Besides, the imaging contrast of [18F]BIBD-124 is better than that of [18F]AV45. Mass spectrometric metabolic analysis showed that BIBD-124 was less demethylated than AV45 without subsequent acetylation, which might explain its less nonspecific uptake and higher imaging contrast. Gauss calculations further confirmed that the introduction of N5 in [18F]BIBD-124 decreased demethylation. Considering imaging contrast and in vivo defluorination, [18F]BIBD-124 is expected to be a promising radiotracer of AO' plaques for further clinical trials.

New fused pyrroles with rA1/A2A antagonistic activity as potential therapeutics for neurodegenerative disorders	MOLECULAR DIVERSITY			English	Article						Pyrrolopyrimidine analogues; 7-Deazapurine derivatives; 7-Azaindole derivatives; Suzuki cross-coupling reactions; Adenosine A(1) and/or A(2A) receptor antagonists; Parkinson's disease; Alzheimer's disease	ADENOSINE A(2A) RECEPTOR; PALLADIUM; A(1); PHARMACOLOGY; RAT; 8-CYCLOPENTYL-1,3-DIPROPYLXANTHINE; PERSPECTIVES; NONXANTHINE; AFFINITY; AGONISTS	In a pilot study, eleven pyrrolopyridine and pyrrolopyrimidine derivatives (specifically, 7-azaindole and 7-deazapurine derivatives) were synthesised by Suzuki cross-coupling reactions and evaluated via radioligand binding assays as potential adenosine receptor (AR) antagonists in order to further investigate the structure-activity relationships of these compounds. 6-Chloro-4-phenyl-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-b]pyridine, with a 7-azaindole scaffold, was identified as a selective A(1)AR antagonist with a rA(1)K(i) value of 0.16 mu M, and interestingly, the addition of a N-atom to the aforementioned fused heterocyclic ring system, creating corresponding 7-deazapurines, led to a dual A(1)/A(2A) AR ligand (2-chloro-4-phenyl-7H-pyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidine: rA(1)K(i): 0.19 +/- 0.02 mu M; rA(2A)K(i): 0.43 +/- 0.01 mu M). Introducing an additional N-atom into the heterocyclic ring system was tolerable for rA(1) AR affinity and also led to rA(2A) AR affinity. This pilot study concluded that new 7-azaindole and 7-deazapurine derivatives represent interesting scaffolds for design of A(1) and/or A(2A) AR antagonists. [GRAPHICS] .

Although the brainstem is an important structure in this regard, PET radioligand binding quantification in brainstem areas often shows poor reliability. This study aims to improve PET quantification of 5-HT1B receptor binding in the brainstem. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were selected based on a 3D [H-3]AZ10419369 Autoradiography brainstem model, which visualized 5-HT1B receptor distribution in high resolution. Two previously developed VOI delineation methods were tested and compared to a conventional manual method. For a method based on template data, a [C-11]AZ10419369 PET template was created by averaging parametric binding potential (BPND) images of 52 healthy subjects. VOIs were generated based on a predefined volume and BPND thresholding and subsequently applied to test-retest [C-11]AZ10419369 parametric BPND images of 8 healthy subjects. For a method based on individual subject data, VOIs were generated directly on each individual parametric image. Both methods showed improved reliability compared to a conventional manual VOI. The VOIs created with [C-11]AZ10419369 template data can be automatically applied to future PET studies measuring 5-HT1B receptor binding in the brainstem.

Pharmacological characterization of mutant huntingtin aggregate-directed PET imaging tracer candidates	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							BETA-SHEET STRUCTURE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; POLYGLUTAMINE AGGREGATION; PROTEIN AGGREGATION; AMYLOID FIBRILS; SMALL MOLECULES; EXON-1; DYSFUNCTION; TOXICITY; BRAIN	Huntington's disease (HD) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first exon of the huntingtin (HTT) gene coding for the huntingtin (HTT) protein. The misfolding and consequential aggregation of CAG-expanded mutant HTT (mHTT) underpin HD pathology. Our interest in the life cycle of HTT led us to consider the development of high-affinity small-molecule binders of HTT oligomerized/amyloid-containing species that could serve as either cellular and in vivo imaging tools or potential therapeutic agents. We recently reported the development of PET tracers CHDI-180 and CHDI-626 as suitable for imaging mHTT aggregates, and here we present an in-depth pharmacological investigation of their binding characteristics. We have implemented an array of in vitro and ex vivo radiometric binding assays using recombinant HTT, brain homogenate-derived HTT aggregates, and brain sections from mouse HD models and humans post-mortem to investigate binding affinities and selectivity against other pathological proteins from indications such as Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia 1. Radioligand binding assays and autoradiography studies using brain homogenates and tissue sections from HD mouse models showed that CHDI-180 and CHDI-626 specifically bind mHTT aggregates that accumulate with age and disease progression. Finally, we characterized CHDI-180 and CHDI-626 regarding their off-target selectivity and binding affinity to beta amyloid plaques in brain sections and homogenates from Alzheimer's disease patients.

Radiotracers must be produced for positron emission tomography studies in humans according to prescribed time schedules while also meeting current good manufacturing practice. Translation of an experimental radiosynthesis to a current good manufacturing practice environment is challenging. Here we exemplify such translation with a protocol for the production of an emerging radiotracer for imaging brain translocator protein 18 kDa, namely [C-11]ER176. This radiotracer is produced by rapid conversion of cyclotron-produced [C-11]carbon dioxide into [C-11]iodomethane, which is then used to treat N-desmethyl-ER176 in the presence of base ((BuOK)-Bu-t) at room temperature for 5 min. [C-11]ER176 is separated in high purity by reversed-phase HPLC and formulated for intravenous injection in sterile ethanol-saline. The radiosynthesis is reliable and takes 50 min. Quality control takes another 20 min. All aspects of the protocol, including quality control, are discussed. Radiotracers used in human positron emission tomography studies need to be prepared according to current good manufacturing practice. Here we use the synthesis of [C-11]ER176 as an example to show the translation of an experimental radiosynthesis to a current good manufacturing practice process.

Still, limited success has been achieved in getting new chemical modulators on the market. As such, there is a clear interest in the design of novel selective chemical entities for this family of receptors. In this work, we investigate the selective recognition of ISAM-140, a recently reported A(2B)AR reference antagonist. A combination of semipreparative chiral HPLC, circular dichroism and X-ray crystallography was used to separate and unequivocally assign the configuration of each enantiomer. Subsequently affinity evaluation for both A(2A) and A(2B) receptors demonstrate the stereospecific and selective recognition of (S)-ISAM140 to the A(2B)AR. The molecular modeling suggested that the structural determinants of this selectivity profile would be residue V250(6.51) in A(2B)AR, which is a leucine in all other ARs including the closely related A(2A)AR. This was herein confirmed by radioligand binding assays and rigorous free energy perturbation (FEP) calculations performed on the L249V(6.51) mutant A(2A)AR receptor. Taken together, this study provides further insights in the binding mode of these A(2B)AR antagonists, paving the way for future ligand optimization.

Here, we investigate in a novel sample if the association is related to affective components of memory, by examining the association between cerebral 5-HT4R binding and affective verbal memory recall. MethodsTwenty-four healthy volunteers were scanned with the 5-HT4R radioligand [C-11]SB207145 and positron emission tomography, and were tested with the Verbal Affective Memory Test-24. The association between 5-HT4R binding and affective verbal memory was evaluated using a linear latent variable structural equation model. ResultsWe observed a significant inverse association across all regions between 5-HT4R binding and affective verbal memory performances for positive (p=5.5x10(-4)) and neutral (p=.004) word recall, and an inverse but nonsignificant association for negative (p=.07) word recall. Differences in the associations with 5-HT4R binding between word categories (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) did not reach statistical significance. ConclusionOur findings replicate our previous observation of a negative association between 5-HT4R binding and memory performance in an independent cohort and provide novel evidence linking 5-HT4R binding, as a biomarker for synaptic 5-HT levels, to the mnestic processing of positive and neutral word stimuli in healthy humans.

PET plays a significant role in the diagnosis, prognostication, and treatment of various cancers, including brain tumors. In this article, we compare uptake mechanisms and the clinical performance of the amino acid PET radiotracers (L-[methyl-C-11]methionine [MET], F-18-fluoroethyl-tyrosine [FET], F-18-fluoro-L-dihydroxy-phenylalanine [FDOPA], and C-11-alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan [AMT]) most commonly used for brain tumor imaging. First, we discuss and compare the mechanisms of tumoral transport and accumulation, the basis of differential performance of these radioligands in clinical studies. Then we summarize studies that provided direct comparisons among these amino acid tracers and to clinically used 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose [FDG] PET imaging. We also discuss how tracer kinetic analysis can enhance the clinical information obtained from amino acid PET images. We discuss both similarities and differences in potential clinical value for each radioligand. This comparative review can guide which radiotracer to favor in future clinical trials aimed at defining the role of these molecular imaging modalities in the clinical management of brain tumor patients.

Synthesis and evaluation of C-11, F-18 and I-125 small molecule radioligands for detecting oxytocin receptors	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Oxytocin; Vasopressin; Receptors; Iodine-125; Autoradiography	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; VASOPRESSIN; BEHAVIOR; BRAIN; PERMEABILITY; ANTAGONISTS; L-371,257; DENSITY; BINDING	Compounds 1-4 were synthesized and investigated for selectivity and potency for the oxytocin receptor (OTR) to determine their viability as radioactive ligands. Binding assays determined 1-4 to have high binding affinity for both the human and rodent OTR and also have high selectivity for the human OTR over human vasopressin V1a receptors (V1aR). Inadequate selectivity for OTR over V1aR was found for rodent receptors in all four compounds. The radioactive (C-11, F-18, and I-125) derivatives of 1-4 were synthesized and investigated for use as autoradiography and positron emission tomography (PET) ligands. Receptor autoradiography performed with [I-125]1 and [I-125]2 on rodent brain slices provided the first small molecule radioligand images of the OTR and V1aR. Biodistribution studies determined [I-125]1 and [I-125]2 were adequate for in vivo peripheral investigations, but not for central investigations due to low uptake within the brain. A biodistribution study with [F-18]3 suggested brain uptake occurred slowly over time. PET imaging studies with [F-18]3 and [C-11]4 using a rat model provided insufficient uptake in the brain over a 90 and 45 min scan times respectively to merit further investigations in non-human primates.

We used receptor-binding autoradiography of the mGluR2/3-selective radioligand [H-3]LY341495 in postmortem brain specimens from PD patients (n = 14) and controls (n = 11) to investigate possible contributions of changes in ligand binding of this receptor to levodopa-associated motor complications experienced premortem in PD patients. The PD patients included those with and without histories of dyskinesias and those with and without "wearing off," which is defined as a reduced period of benefit from levodopa. Specific binding of [H-3]LY341495 to mGluR2/3 in the basal ganglia was higher in the caudate nucleus than the putamen and lower by approximately half in the external and internal globus pallidus (GPi) in controls. [H-3]LY341495-specific binding was reduced in the caudate and GPi in patients without wearing-off (-22% caudate -30% GPi), compared with controls and with patients who had experienced wearing-off, there were no differences among PD patients with or without dyskinesias. These data suggest that an adaptive downregulation of mGluR2/3 in PD patients without wearing-off may compensate for increased glutamate. They indicate a key role for mGluR2/3 in control of movement and the potential for mGluR2/3-targeted drugs in the management of wearing-off fluctuations in PD.

Here we assessed the acute seizurogenic and toxic properties of DA, isodomoic acids A, B and C (Iso-A, -B, -C), and the therapeutic potential of these compounds as pharmacological preconditioning agents. DA, Iso-A, Iso-B, and Iso-C all produced significant dose-dependent increases in seizure activity following intrahippocampal administration; doses producing half maximal cumulative seizure scores (ED50) were 137 pmol, 171 pmol, 13,000 pmol. and 3150 pmol, respectively. Pharmacological preconditioning with low-dose DA or Iso-A, 60 min before a high test dose of DA produced a significant reduction in seizure scores. In contrast, Iso-B and Iso-C each failed to induce any detectable tolerance to high-dose DA. Radioligand binding indicated a significant correlation between seizurogenic potency and kainate receptor affinity with K(1)s of 2.4 nM, 4.4 nM, 4990 nM and 170 nM for DA, Iso-A, Iso-B and Iso-C, respectively. Our in vivo results indicate that DA and Iso-A are functionally equipotent in acute seizure induction by direct intrahippocampal administration, while Iso-B and Iso-C are distinctly less potent.

Cannabinoid system in the budgerigar brain	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						CB1 receptor; WIN55,212-2; SR141716A; receptor autoradiography; [S-35]GTP gamma S autoradiography avian	VOCAL CONTROL PATHWAYS; ACTIVATED G-PROTEINS; RAT-BRAIN; MELOPSITTACUS-UNDULATUS; ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; ENDOGENOUS CANNABINOIDS; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; MOLECULAR-CLONING; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; PURKINJE-CELLS	Cannabinoid receptor density and cannabinoid receptor-mediated G protein stimulation were studied by autoradiographic techniques throughout the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) brain. The maximal CB1 receptor density value (using [H-3]CP55,940 as radioligand) was found in the molecular layer of the cerebellum (Mol), and high binding values were observed in the nucleus taeniae amygdalae (TnA), nucleus preopticus medialis, and nucleus pretectalis. The highest net-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding values induced by the selective CB1 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 were observed in the nucleus paramedianus internus thalami, and high values of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding were observed in the TnA, Mol, arcopallium dorsale and arcopallium intermedium. The distribution data suggest that in the budgerigar, as previously indicated in mammals, cannabinoid receptors may be related to the control of several brain functions in the motor system, memory, visual system, and reproductive behavior. The discrepancies between the cannabinoid receptor densities and the cannabinoid receptor-mediated stimulation found in several budgerigar brain nuclei support the hypothesis, previously described for mammals, of the existence of different G(i/o) protein populations able to associate with the cannabinoid receptors, depending on the brain structure, and could reflect the relative importance that cannabinoid transmission could exerts in each cerebral area.

We developed a method for the efficient N-[C-11]methylation of CP-122,721, yielding the NKi, antagonist N-[C-11]methyl CP-643,051. The brain uptake and distribution of N-[C-11]methyl CP-643,051 were studied by positron emission tomography (PET) in the anaesthetized pig, first in a baseline condition, and again after displacement of specific binding with the NK1, receptor antagonist L-732,138 (0.6 mg/kg, i.v.). In order to validate this displacement procedure, we tested the effects of L-732,138 on cerebral blood flow (CBF) in one pia. We found that N-[C-11]methyl CP-643,051 had a distribution volume close to 3 ml g(-1), and a binding potential (pB) of 0.3 in the pig striatum; this binding was displaceable by the L-732,138 pre-treatment, which evoked a small (10-20%) global increase in CBF. We conclude that of N-[C-11]methyl CP-643,051 may serve as a lead structure for the development of PET NK-1 ligands of higher specific binding in vivo. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the baboon brain, 5-[I-123]iodo-A-85380 displayed a profile consistent with the known distribution of nAChRs, however, 5-[I-123]iodo-A-84543 displayed a homogenous uptake with no preferential localisation in regions known to contain nAChRs. To examine the effect of halogen substitution on the 3-pyridyl ether, A-84543, the 5-chloro, 5-bromo and 5-iodo analogues were synthesised and evaluated with respect to nAChR binding. In vitro binding data revealed that halogen substitution at the 5-position of A-84543 was not well tolerated with an increase in halogen size resulting in lower binding towards nAChRs.

The Ang II-induced proliferation was inhibited by CV-11974 (AT(1) antagonist; 1 muM) and saralasin (AT(1)/AT(2) antagonist; 1 muM), but not by PD123,319 (AT(2) antagonist; 1 muM), suggesting that Ang II-induced proliferation was mediated via AT(1) receptors present in and/or on gingival fibroblasts. The results of Western blot analysis indicated the presence of AT(1) and AT(2) receptors in/on the fibroblasts. In a subsequent radioligand binding assay, the binding of [H-3]Ang II to the fibroblasts was specific and saturable with both high- and low-affinity sites. Competition binding experiments indicated that Ang II completely displaced [H-3]Ang II binding, and CV 11974 and PD123,319 maximally displaced up to approximately 63% and 37% of the total binding, respectively. Ang II and CV-11974 completely displaced the [H-3]DuP753 binding but PD123,319 did not, indicating a single population of binding site. These findings demonstrate that gingival fibroblasts contain both AT(1) and AT(2) receptor subtypes for Ang II, and support that Ang II stimulation of AT(1) receptors results in proliferation of the fibroblasts.

The goal was to determine a limiting dose consistent with accepted guidelines for use in clinical studies and to compare the radiation burden with other agents such as I-123-FPCIT, F-18-fluorodopa, and F-18-FDG. Methods: Dynamic PET scans of the urinary bladder were obtained in 6 subjects; 2 subjects had brain scans and 5 subjects had scans of the thorax or abdomen. Regions of interest were placed over composite images of each organ for which activity was visualized to generate time-activity curves. Doses were calculated from residence times using the MIRDOSE3 program. Results: The critical organ for dosimetry is the urinary bladder wall with a dose of 0.0586 +/- 0.0164 mGy/MBq. The dose comes primarily (97.2%) from activity in the urinary bladder contents. The dose is lower than any of the other agents used commonly in PET to assess dopaminergic function. The effective dose equivalent (0.0120 mGy/MBq) is also lower than comparable compounds. Conclusion: F-18-FPCIT has favorable dosimetry when compared with other agents used to study dopaminergic function. Doses as high as 853 MBq (23 mCi) may be given to adult patients and remain within accepted guidelines.

Human homomeric p1 GABA(C) receptor expressed in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) undergoes specific and saturable high-affinity binding of 4-n-[H-3]propyl-4'-ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate ([H-3]EBOB) using a cyano analog (CNBOB) to determine non-specific binding. This GABA(C) rho1 receptor is very sensitive to CNBOB and lindane relative to alpha-endosulfan. tert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate. picrotoxinin and fipronil (IC50 values of 23, 91 800, 1080 4000 and > 10000 nM, respectively, in displacing [H-3]EBOB). A similar potency sequence (except for picrotoxinin) is observed for inhibition of GABA-induced currents of rho1 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The present study does not consider rho2 homomeric and rho1rho2 heteromeric GABA(C) receptors which are known to be more sensitive than rho1 to picrotoxinin. The inhibitor sensitivity and specificity of this rho1 GABA(C) receptor differ greatly from those of human homomeric beta3 and native GABA(A) receptors, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

However, we have previously demonstrated that gacyclidine enantiomers [(-) and (+)GK11] interact with other ('non-NMDA') binding sites which may play a role in the lower self-neurotoxicity of this compound relative to the other NMDA receptor antagonists. Evidence for these binding sites has been obtained from autoradiographic and membrane binding experiments. They were found to be expressed at high levels in the molecular layer of the cerebellum, although they can also been seen in the granular layer and in telencephalic regions. The present study was designed to further characterize these gacyclidine 'non-NMDA' binding sites. The pharmacological profiles obtained on cerebellar and telencephalic membrane homogenates showed that they could not be linked directly to the main receptors or uptake complexes of the central nervous system (CNS), However, the comparison of (-) and (+)[H-3]GK11 binding distribution in different mutant animals bearing specific cellular deficits in the cerebellum has demonstrated that the gacyclidine 'non-NMDA' binding sites are associated with the dendritic trees of Purkinje cells. Interestingly, our study also shows that the radioligand binding to both cerebellar and telencephalic structures could be modulated by endogeneous factors which can be removed by a stringent prewashing procedure.

Several strategies have been developed for the preparation of-bicyclic lactam analogues of alpha -conotoxin SI, a 13-residue peptide neurotoxin found in cone snail venom. Four analogues of the natural regioisomer of alpha -conotoxin SI were designed and synthesized, each with one of the two paired cysteines of the parent peptide being replaced by a side-chain lactam bridged glutamic acid/lysine pair. Solid-phase lactamization was studied to determine rates of formation of the two possible loops and to document the extent of dimerization and higher oligomerization. Radioligand binding assays were carried out on all synthesized peptides, including the naturally occurring two-disulfide form, in order to determine their affinities for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Replacement of the Cys(2)-Cys(7) loop Of alpha -conotoxin SI With a lactam bridge resulted in complete loss of activity, whereas replacement of the Cys(3)-Cys(13) disulfide loop resulted in a similar to 60-fold reduction in affinity for one orientation and a similar to 70-fold increase in affinity for the other. The two active lactam analogues retain the selectivity exhibited by the naturally occurring peptide for the alpha/delta subunit of nAChRs, as judged by competition experiments with the curariform antagonist metocurine.

[<SUP>111</SUP>In-DOTA]Somatostatin-14 analogs as potential pansomatostatin-like radiotracers - first results of a preclinical study	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Radiolabeled pansomatostatins; In-111-radiotracer; sst(1-5)-targeted tumor imaging		Background: In this study, we report on the synthesis, radiolabeling, and biological evaluation of two new somatostatin-14 (SS14) analogs, modified with the universal chelator DOTA. We were interested to investigate if and to what extent such radiotracer prototypes may be useful for targeting sst(1-5)-expressing tumors in man but, most importantly, to outline potential drawbacks and benefits associated with their use. Methods: AT1S and AT2S (DOTA-Ala(1)-Gly(2)-c[Cys(3)-Lys(4)-Asn(5)-Phe(6)-Phe(7)-Trp(8)/DTrp(8)-Lys(9)-Thr(10)-Phe(11)-Thr(12)-Ser(13)-Cys(14)-OH], respectively) were synthesized on the solid support and labeled with In-111. The sst(1-5) affinity profile of AT1S/AT2S was determined by receptor autoradiography using [Leu(8), DTrp(22),I-125-Tyr(25)]SS28 as radioligand. The ability of AT2S to stimulate sst(2) or sst(3) internalization was qualitatively analyzed by an immunofluorescence-based internalization assay using hsst(2)- or hsst(3)-expressing HEK293 cells. Furthermore, the internalization of the radioligands [In-111]AT1S and [In-111]AT2S was studied at 37 degrees C in AR4-2J cells endogenously expressing sst(2). The in vivo stability of [In-111]AT1S and [In-111]AT2S was tested by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of mouse blood collected 5 min after radioligand injection, and biodistribution was studied in normal mice. Selectively for [In-111]AT2S, biodistribution was further studied in SCID mice bearing AR4-2J, HEK293-hsst(2A)(+), -hsst(3)(+) or -hsst(5)(+) tumors. Results: The new SS14-derived analogs were obtained by solid phase peptide synthesis and were easily labeled with In-111. Both SS14 conjugates, AT1S, and its DTrp(8) counterpart, AT2S, showed a pansomatostatin affinity profile with the respective hsst(1-5) IC50 values in the lower nanomolar range. In addition, AT2S behaved as an agonist for sst(2) and sst(3) since it stimulated receptor internalization. The In-111 radioligands effectively and specifically internalized into rsst(2A)-expressing AR4-2J cells with [In-111]AT2S internalizing faster than [In-111]AT1S. Ex vivo mouse blood analysis revealed a rapid degradation of both radiopeptides in the bloodstream with the DTrp8 analog showing higher stability. Biodistribution results in healthy mice were consistent with these findings with only [In-111]AT2S showing specific uptake in the sst(2)-rich pancreas. Biodistribution of [In-111]AT2S in tumor-bearing mice revealed receptor-mediated uptake in the AR4-2J (1.82 +/- 0.36 %ID/g - block 0.21 +/- 0.17 %ID/g at 4 h post injection (pi)), the HEK293-hsst(2A)(+) (1.49 +/- 0.2 %ID/g - block 0.27 +/- 0.20 %ID/g at 4 h pi), the HEK293-hsst(3)(+) (1.24 +/- 0.27 %ID/g - block 0.32 +/- 0.06 %ID/g at 4 h pi), and the HEK293-hsst(5)(+) tumors (0.41 +/- 0.12 %ID/g - block 0.22 +/- 0.006 %ID/g at 4 h pi). Radioactivity washed out from blood and background tissues via the kidneys. Conclusions: This study has revealed that the native SS14 structure can indeed serve as a motif for the development of promising pansomatostatin-like radiotracers. Further peptide stabilization is required to increase in vivo stability and, consequently, to enhance in vivo delivery and tumor targeting.

Prognostic importance of prostatic specific antigen response in patients who received Lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen treatment for castration resistant prostate cancer	QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Prostatic neoplasms; Prostate-specific antigen; Survival	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PSMA	BACKGROUND: This study aims to analyze the prognostic importance of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) response in patients who received radioligand therapy (RLT) with Lu-177 Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) for their castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients who received Lu-177 PSMA treatment for their castration-resistant prostate carcinoma were included. All the patients had undergone Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT scanning before Lu-177 PSMA therapy, which revealed multiple metastases. Patients were treated with a fixed dose (180 mCi) of Lu-177 PSMA at six to eight weeks intervals. PSA response was evaluated using Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria. Serum PSA response was classified as PSA progression (25% increase over the baseline and an increase in the absolute-value PSA level by at least 5 ng per millilitre), any <50% decline or >= 50% decline. PSA response was evaluated six weeks after every cycle. Response evaluation with radiological imaging and Ga-68 PSMA PET/CT were performed before the first cycle and eight weeks after the last cycle. RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated with a total of 171 cycles (median 4, range 3-7) of Lu-177 PSMA. A decline in serum PSA of >= 50% was detected in ten patients (33%) while a decline in PSA of any amount was observed in fifteen (50%) patients after the first cycle. After the last cycle, a decline in PSA >= 50% and of any amount was seen in thirteen (43%) and fourteen (46%) patients, respectively. Of the fifteen patients who were not responder after the first cycle, three (20%) had a decline in PSA of any amount after the completion of the RLT. Moreover, of the 20 patients who did not have a >= 50% decline in PSA level after the first cycle, four (20%) became responder after the last cycle. Regarding serum PSA response after the first cycle, median OS was significantly higher for patients who had >50% decline in PSA level with 21.0 +/- 10.0 (95% CI: 1.2-40.7) months compared to patients who had not with 8.0 +/- 12.6 (95% CI: 2.7-13.2) months (P=0.012). A decline in PSA of any amount after the first cycle did not have a significant impact on median OS (12.0 +/- 1.1 vs. 6.0 +/- 2.5 months, P=0.08). The decline in serum PSA level after the last cycle of treatment had a significant impact on OS. Median OS for the decline in PSA of any amount was calculated as 13.0 +/- 1.0 (95% CI: 10.9-15.0) months for responders and 6.0 +/- 1.9 (95% CI: 2.2-9.7) months for non-responders (P=0.016). Considering >= 50% of decline as a response. median OS was 21.0 +/- 5.8 (95% CI: 9.5-32.4) months for responders and 6.0 +/- 3.0 (95% CI: 0.1-11.8) months for non-responders (P=0.026). CONCLUSIONS: Serum PSA level during RLT with Lu-177 PSMA remains a clinically significant factor to predict OS times. About twenty percent of patients who were not responder after the first cycle could become responder after the last cycle. However, patients without PSA response after completion of all cycles should be closely followed-up. Non-responder patients can achieve a response with further treatments.

Peering into the Brain's Estrogen Receptors: PET Tracers for Visualization of Nuclear and Extranuclear Estrogen Receptors in Brain Disorders	BIOMOLECULES			English	Article						PET; estrogen receptors; radioligand; ER alpha; ER beta; GPER; positron emission tomography; genomic estrogen signaling; non-genomic estrogen signaling; membrane estrogen receptors	GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; BETA MESSENGER-RNA; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; DRUG-NAIVE PATIENTS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; HUMAN HYPOTHALAMUS; BREAST-CANCER; ER-ALPHA; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS	Estrogen receptors (ERs) play a multitude of roles in brain function and are implicated in various brain disorders. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for the visualization of ERs' intricate landscape has shown promise in oncology but remains limited in the context of brain disorders. Despite recent progress in the identification and development of more selective ligands for various ERs subtypes, further optimization is necessary to enable the reliable and efficient imaging of these receptors. In this perspective, we briefly touch upon the significance of estrogen signaling in the brain and raise the setbacks associated with the development of PET tracers for identification of specific ERs subtypes in the brain. We then propose avenues for developing efficient PET tracers to non-invasively study the dynamics of ERs in the brain, as well as neuropsychiatric diseases associated with their malfunction in a longitudinal manner. This perspective puts several potential candidates on the table and highlights the unmet needs and areas requiring further research to unlock the full potential of PET tracers for ERs imaging, ultimately aiding in deepening our understanding of ERs and forging new avenues for potential therapeutic strategies.

Particularly, LRRK2-Gly2019Ser mutation was reported to alter the early phase of neuronal differentiation, increasing cell death. Selective inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase activity were considered as a promising therapeutic target for PD treatment. However, the development of effective brain-penetrant LRRK2 inhibitors remains challenging. Recently, we have developed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for LRRK2 imaging and demonstrated preferable tracer properties in rodents. Herein, we evaluate [F-18]PF-06455943 quantification methods in the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain using full kinetic modeling with radiometabolite-corrected arterial blood samples, and homologous blocking with two doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg). Kinetic analysis results demonstrated that a two-tissue compartmental model and a Logan graphical analysis are appropriate for [F-18]PF-06455943 PET quantification. In addition, we observed that total distribution volume (VT) values can be reliably estimated with as short as a 30 min scan duration. Homologous blocking studies confirmed the specific binding of [F-18]PF-06455943 and revealed that the nonradioactive mass of PF-06455943 achieved 45-55% of VT displacement in the whole brain. This work supports the translation of [F-18]PF-06455943 PET imaging for the human brain and target occupancy studies.

Given the replicated finding of increased microglial activation in AD, we sought to investigate whether microglial activation is also elevated in aMCI and whether it is related to amyloid beta (A beta) burden in-vivo. Eleven aMCI participants and 14 healthy volunteers completed positron emission tomography (PET) scans with [F-18]-FEPPA and [C-11]-PIB. Given the known sensitivity in affinity of second-generation TSPO radioligands, participants were genotyped for the TSPO polymorphism and only high-affinity binders were included. Dynamic [F-18]-FEPPA PET images were analyzed using the 2-tissue compartment model with arterial plasma input function. Additionally, a supplementary method, the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR), was explored. [C-11]-PIB PET images were analyzed using the Logan graphical method. aMCI participants had significantly higher [C-11]-PIB binding in the cortical regions. No significant differences in [F-18]-FEPPA binding were observed between aMCI participants and healthy volunteers. In the aMCI group, [F-18]-FEPPA and [C-11]-PIB bindings were correlated in the hippocampus. There were no correlations between our PET measures and cognition. Our findings demonstrate that while A beta burden is evident in the aMCI stage, microglial activation may not be present.	[Knezevic, Dunja; Verhoeff, Nicolaas Paul L.

Prospects of Targeting the Gastrin Releasing Peptide Receptor and Somatostatin Receptor 2 for Nuclear Imaging and Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EXPRESSION; SUBTYPES	Background The gastrin releasing peptide receptor (GRPR) and the somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) are overexpressed on primary breast cancer (BC), making them ideal candidates for receptor- mediated nuclear imaging and therapy. The aim of this study was to determine whether these receptors are also suitable targets for metastatic BC. Methods mRNA expression of human BC samples were studied by in vitro autoradiography and associated with radioligand binding. Next, GRPR and SSTR2 mRNA levels of 60 paired primary BCs and metastases from different sites were measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receptor mRNA expression levels were associated with clinico-pathological factors and expression levels of primary tumors and corresponding metastases were compared. Results Binding of GRPR and SSTR radioligands to tumor tissue correlated significantly with receptor mRNA expression. High GRPR and SSTR2 mRNA levels were associated with estrogen receptor (ESR1)-positive tumors (p< 0.001 for both receptors). There was no significant difference in GRPR mRNA expression of primary tumors versus paired metastases. Regarding SSTR2 mRNA expression, there was also no significant difference in the majority of cases, apart from liver and ovarian metastases which showed a significantly lower expression compared to the corresponding primary tumors (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). Conclusion Targeting the GRPR and SSTR2 for nuclear imaging and/ or treatment has the potential to improve BC care in primary as well as metastatic disease.

TGF-beta mediates diverse biological responses by signalling through type I and II TGF-beta receptors (T beta RI and T beta RII). We have previously identified CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, as a novel TGF-beta co-receptor that negatively regulates TGF-beta signalling and responses and demonstrated that membrane-anchored CD109 promotes TGF-beta receptor degradation via a SMAD7/Smurf2-mediated mechanism. To determine whether CD109 released from the cell surface (soluble CD109 or sCD109) also acts as a TGF-beta antagonist, we determined the efficacy of recombinant sCD109 to interact with TGF-beta and inhibit TGF-beta signalling and responses. Our results demonstrate that sCD109 binds TGF-beta with high affinity as determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and cell-based radioligand binding and affinity labelling competition assays. SPR detected slow dissociation kinetics between sCD109 and TGF-beta at low concentrations, indicating a stable and effective interaction. In addition, sCD109 antagonizes TGF-beta-induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation, transcription and cell migration. Together, our results suggest that sCD109 can bind TGF-beta, inhibit TGF-beta binding to its receptors and decrease TGF-beta signalling and TGF-beta-induced cellular responses.

To gain insight into the mechanism of binding of the synthesized compounds, a tritiated antagonist, (R)-N-a-diphenylacetyl-N-omega-[2-([2,3-H-3]propionylamino)ethyl]aminocarbonyl-(4-hydroxybenzyl)arginin-amide ([H-3]UR-MK299, [H-3]38), was prepared. [H-3]38 revealed a dissociation constant in the picomolar range (K-d 0.044 nM, SK-N-MC cells) and very high Y1R selectivity. Apart from superior affinity, a considerably lower target off-rate (t1/2 95 min) was characteristic of [H-3]38 compared to that of the higher homologue containing a tetramethylene instead of an ethylene spacer (t(1/2) 3 min, K-d 2.0 nM). Y1R binding of [H-3]38 was fully reversible and fully displaceable by nonpeptide antagonists and the agonist pNPY. Therefore, the insurmountable antagonism observed in the functional assay has to be attributed to the extended target-residence time, a phenomenon of relevance in drug research beyond the NPY receptor field.

Syntheses of reference standard 1 and the corresponding des-fluoroethyl radiolabeling precursor (2) were achieved with 75% and 65% yields, respectively. In vitro pharmacology assay of FECIMBI-36 by [H-3]-ketanserin competition binding assay obtained from NIMH-PDSP showed high affinities to 5-HT2AR (K-i = 1 nM) and 5-HT2CR (K-i = 1.7 nM). Radiolabeling of FECIMBI-36 was achieved from the boc-protected precursor 2 using [F-18]-fluoroethyltosylate in presence of Cs2CO3 in DMSO followed by removal of the protective group. [F-18]1 was isolated using RP-HPLC in 25 +/- 5% yield, purity >= 95% and specific activity 1-2 Ci/mu mol (N = 6). In vitro autoradiography studies demonstrate that [F-18]1 selectively label 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in slide-mounted sections of postmortem human brain using phosphor imaging. Our results indicate the potential of [F-18]1 for imaging 5-HT2A/2C receptors in the high affinity state in vivo using PET imaging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Golden Age of RyR and GABA-R Diamide and Isoxazoline Insecticides: Common Genesis, Serendipity, Surprises, Selectivity, and Safety	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; GATED CHLORIDE CHANNELS; RYANODINE RECEPTOR; ANTHRANILIC DIAMIDE; DIAMONDBACK MOTH; BINDING-SITES; FLUBENDIAMIDE; MODE; AFOXOLANER; RESISTANCE	The serendipitous observation of the insecticidal activity of a candidate herbicide was the first in a series of surprises that changed the course of insecticide research and opened the Golden Age of Diamide and Isoxazoline Insecticides which have a common genesis. Two novel modes of action were discovered, one involving the ?-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor of the chloride channel and the other the ryanodine receptor (RyR) of the calcium-activated calcium channel. These are old insecticide targets, but physiological assays and radioligand binding studies reveal that the new diamides and isoxazolines act at previously unrecognized sites without cross-resistance to other chemotypes and more important differing between insects and mammals resulting in selective toxicity and mechanistically based safety. The phthalic diamide flubendiamide and anthranilic diamides chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole act at an allosteric site of the RyR to activate calcium release in insects but not mammals. They are the most important insecticide introductions of the past decade. Isoxazoline and meta-diamide insecticides and their previously unrecognized GABA-R target are more recent discoveries. Isoxazolines are currently important in flea and tick control in dogs and cats, and meta-diamides show promise for pest management and crop protection. These 21st century RyR and GABA-R diamides and isoxazolines were serendipitous discoveries and developments showing the importance of mechanism studies in maintaining the arsenal of safe and effective insecticides.

For the nudibranch mollusk Hermissenda crassicornis no endogenous compounds were known, and here we describe the isolation of 6-BHP from this mollusk and its effects on different nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR). Two-electrode voltage-clamp experiments on the chimeric alpha 7 nAChR (built of chicken alpha 7 ligand-binding and glycine receptor transmembrane domains) or on rat alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR expressed in Xenopus oocytes revealed no action of 6-BHP. However, in radioligand analysis, 6-BHP competed with radioiodinated alpha-bungarotoxin for binding to human alpha 7 nAChR expressed in GH(4)C(1) cells (IC50 23 +/- 1 mu M), but showed no competition on muscle-type nAChR from Torpedo californica. In Ca2+-imaging experiments on the human alpha 7 nAChR expressed in the Neuro2a cells, 6-BHP in the presence of PNU120596 behaved as an agonist (EC50 ~80 mu M). To the best of our knowledge, 6-BHP is the first low-molecular weight compound from marine source which is an agonist of the nAChR subtype. This may have physiological importance because H. crassicornis, with its simple and tractable nervous system, is a convenient model system for studying the learning and memory processes.

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 binding and protein expression in schizophrenia and following antipsychotic drug treatment	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Antipsychotic; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; mGluR5; Post-mortem human brain tissue; Schizophrenia	MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AMINO-ACID TRANSPORTER-2; GENE-EXPRESSION; MGLU5 RECEPTORS; WORKING-MEMORY; NMDA; POTENTIATION; DYSFUNCTION; DENSITY	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for schizophrenia, primarily due to its ability to indirectly modulate glutamatergic signalling through the NMDA receptor (NMDAR). Despite its potential, molecular studies characterising mGluR5 in schizophrenia are limited. We therefore aimed to determine if the mGluR5 binding site or protein levels were altered in schizophrenia or by current antipsychotics. Using in-situ radioligand binding and immunoblot, we measured [H-3]MPEP binding to mGluR5 and mGluR5 protein density in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; BA46) of 37 schizophrenia and 37 matched control subjects. Subsequently, we measured [H-3]MPEP binding in rat brains following typical (haloperidol) or atypical (olanzapine) antipsychotic treatment (n=6/group). Subjects with schizophrenia showed no significant alteration in mGluR5 binding density or mGluR5 protein levels. Furthermore, mGluR5 binding in the rat cortex, thalamus, hippocampus and striatum was unaltered by short-, medium-and long-term antipsychotic treatment. Our data suggests that there are no alterations in mGluR5 in schizophrenia subjects. The lack of alteration in mGluR5 binding and protein in schizophrenia is advantageous because its ability to modulate the NMDAR is potentially unhindered, thereby supporting the development of novel antipsychotic agents that work through the mGluR5/NMDAR complex.

However, the labeling of such molecules is not trivial, especially when poorly soluble tags have to be incorporated. The classical method of coupling usually necessitates a tedious final purification step to remove the excess of reagents and to isolate tagged molecules. To overcome this limitation, Cu(I)- catalyzed 1,3- dipolar cycloaddition, referred to as "click" chemistry, was evaluated as a tool to facilitate the access to labeled molecules. In order to validate the approach, we focused our attention on the incorporation of a fluorophore ( Lissamine Rhodamine B), a nonfluorescent dye ( Patent Blue VF), or biotin into a muscarinic antagonist scaffold derived from pirenzepine. The reaction performed in acetonitrile/ water, in the presence of CuSO4 and Cu wire, allowed us to obtain three novel pirenzepine derivatives with high purity and in good yield. No coupling reagents were needed, and the quasi- stoichiometric conditions of the reaction enabled the straightforward isolation of the final product by simple precipitation and its use in bioassays. The affinity of the compounds for the human M1 muscarinic receptor fused to EGFP was checked under classical radioligand and FRET binding conditions. The three pirenzepine constructs display a nanomolar affinity for the M1 receptor. In addition, both dye- labeled derivatives behave as potent acceptors of energy from excited EGFP with a very high quenching efficiency.

Several psychiatric disorders, including PD, are associated with lower levels of peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the kinetic binding parameters of the specific PBR ligand, PK 11195, in platelets from patients with PD in relation to the presence and severity of adulthood SA. Methods: Using the specific radioligand, [H-3] PK 11195, the kinetic binding parameters of PBR were determined on platelet membranes of 27 adult outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PD and 18 healthy controls. Patients were assessed with the SCID-1, the Panic Disorder Severity Scale, the Structured Clinical Interview for Separation Anxiety Symptoms and the Adult Separation Anxiety Checklist. Results: PD patients had significantly lower PBR density than controls. However, the lower density was only evident in the subgroup of PD patients who also fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for adult separation anxiety disorder. PBR density was negatively correlated with each of the two SA scales total scores. Conclusions: Patients with SA symptoms had significantly lower densities of PBRs. PBR expression might become a useful biological marker of these two associated conditions.

Methods: To illustrate this approach, the iodide concentrations in urine samples were determined by means of RATRA using Na+/I- symporter (NIS). Results: Iodide concentrations ranging from 9 x 10(-6) to 9 x 10(-4) mol/l could be measured without any significant interference of 0.85 mol/l NaCl. The mean recovery rate of added iodide to urine was 96.5%, serial dilutions of urine samples gave almost straight dose response lines passing near the zero point, the mean within assay coefficient of variation (CV) was 8.8% and between assay CV was 12.9%. Although urinary iodide concentrations determined by RATRA correlated with those using a chemical method (r=0.97) and an electrode method (r=0.85), there were discrepancies in absolute values particularly at the low level among these. Conclusions: The RATRA may have a limitation with respect to the specificity for determining analytes in the biological materials, but we suggest it has the ability to detect some factors influencing the transport.

The results indicate that the inhibition of [3H]candesartan binding by sanguinarine is independent of cell viability, since the alkaloid inhibited at a similar extent radioligand binding on both intact Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with the human angiotensin AT(1) receptor (hAT(1)) and their cell membranes (K-i = 0.14 and 1.10 muM, respectively). The unsuccessful recovery of [3H]candesartan binding after washing sanguinarine off the cells suggested a nearly irreversible or slow reversible interaction. Saturation binding studies showed a substantial reduction of the B-max without affecting the K-d. In addition, the presence of 2-n-butyl-4chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-[(2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl)methyl]imidazole (losartan) could not prevent sanguinarine inhibition of [H-3]candesartan binding neither: The present. findings indicate that sanguinarine interacts with the receptor in a slow, nearly irreversible and noncompetitive manner.

The primary gene associated with predisposition to type I diabetes is the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II gene (IDDM1). Recent studies have described linkage and association of type I diabetes to the cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) gene (IDDM12)in Caucasians. CTLA-4 is a candidate gene for T-cell-mediated autoimmune diseases because it is a negative regulator of T-cell proliferation. We investigated distribution of a CTLA-4 (AT)n microsatellite marker in 118 Japanese patients with type I diabetes and 195 control subjects. We also investigated association between this CTLA-4 gene polymorphism and GAD65 antibody positivity in 103 of the patients. CTLA-4 microsatellite marker loci were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA and resolution of the products on sequencing gels. GAD65 antibody was detected by radioligand binding assay. There was no significant difference in the distribution of CTLA-4 alleles between patients and controls, and no difference was observed in the prevalence of CTLA-4 alleles when GAD65 antibody-positive and -negative individuals with the type I diabetes were compared. The present study did not support an association between the CTLA-4 microsatellite marker and type I diabetes in our Japanese study population.

Furthermore, attempt was also made to compare radiation absorbed doses for normal organs and tumor lesions in subsequent cycles of Lu-177-PSMA-617 peptide receptor radioligand therapy (PRLT) in the same group of patients during the course of treatment. Methods: A total of 30 patients of proven mCRPC were enrolled for this prospective study. These patients received up to 5 cycles of treatment with Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT (1 cycle for 13 patients, 2 cycles for 9 patients, 3 cycles for 3 patients, and 5 cycles for 5 patients), at 11-12-week intervals between the two successive therapies. The patients underwent postadministration whole-body scintigraphy at five time points: 0.5 (prevoid), 2, 12, 24, and 72/96 h (postvoid). From time-activity curves generated by drawing regions of interests on the images, number of disintegrations was determined. Tumor masses were estimated from pretherapeutic Ga-68-PSMA-11 positron emission tomography-computed tomography images. Absorbed doses for organs and tumors were calculated using OLINDA 2.0 software. Results: The average activity of Lu-177-PSMA-617 (mean +/- SD) administered per patient per cycle was 4.94 +/- 0.45 GBq. The mean absorbed organ doses (mean +/- SD) from first therapy cycle in Gy/GBq were as follows: kidneys 0.52 +/- 0.16, spleen 0.17 +/- 0.07, liver 0.08 +/- 0.05, salivary glands 0.53 +/- 0.30, lacrimal glands 1.45 +/- 0.85, nasal mucosa membrane 0.46 +/- 0.19, urinary bladder 0.23 +/- 0.02, and bone marrow 0.04 +/- 0.03. The mean effective dose for whole body from first therapy cycle was 0.05 +/- 0.03 Sv/GBq. Among all the normal organs, lacrimal glands received the highest absorbed dose. The median dose for all lesions, bone lesions, lymph nodes, primary site, liver lesion, lung lesion, and soft tissue deposit from first therapy cycle was determined to be 4.17, 4.23, 3.96, 4.36, 10.27, 0.78, and 4.68 Gy/GBq respectively. Absorbed doses received by the normal organs in five consecutive cycles follow three different trends, (a) for kidneys, salivary glands, and nasal mucous membrane, absorbed doses increased from first therapy cycle to second therapy cycle and then slowly decreased in subsequently therapy cycles; (b) for spleen, liver, and lacrimal glands, absorbed doses decreased with the successive therapy cycles; and (c) in case of bone marrow, bladder, and whole body, mean absorbed dose almost remained constant in each therapy cycle. Absorbed doses to the lesions gradually decreased with increase of the number of therapy cycles. Conclusions: The organ and tumor absorbed doses of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in mCRPC patients were found to be comparable to the data reported in the literature. The highest absorbed organ dose was observed in lacrimal glands and being a dose limiting organ, a cumulative activity up to 32.5 GBq (878 mCi) of Lu-177-PSMA-617 in 4-5 therapy cycles appears safe and feasible to achieve full therapeutic window.

It is mainly composed of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II receptors AT1 and AT2. ACE and AT1 are targets of choice for the treatment of hypertension, whereas the AT2 receptor is still not exploited due to the lack of knowledge of its physiological properties. Peptide toxins from venoms display multiple biological functions associated with varied chemical and structural properties. If Brazilian viper toxins have been described to inhibit ACE, no animal toxin is known to act on AT1/AT2 receptors. We screened a library of toxins on angiotensin II receptors with a radioligand competition binding assay. Functional characterization of the selected toxin was conducted by measuring second messenger production, G-protein activation and beta-arrestin 2 recruitment using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) based biosensors. We identified one original toxin, A-CTX-cMila, which is a 7-residues cyclic peptide from Conus miliaris with no homology sequence with known angiotensin peptides nor identified toxins, displaying a 100-fold selectivity for AT1 over AT2. This toxin shows a competitive antagonism mode of action on AT1, blocking G alpha q, G alpha i3, G alpha oA, beta-arrestin 2 pathways and ERK1/2 activation. These results describe the first animal toxin active on angiotensin II receptors.

[<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28 radiotracer kinetics are not driven by alterations in cerebral blood flow	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						PET; MRI; cerebral blood flow; pharmacokinetics; hypercapnia; [C-11]PBR28	TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; PET RADIOLIGAND; GLIAL ACTIVATION; BINDING; BRAIN; MODEL; HYPERCAPNIA; C-11-PBR28; RECEPTORS; PSYCHOSIS	The positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [C-11]PBR28 has been increasingly used to image the translocator protein (TSPO) as a marker of neuroinflammation in a variety of brain disorders. Interrelatedly, similar clinical populations can also exhibit altered brain perfusion, as has been shown using arterial spin labelling in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies. Hence, an unsolved debate has revolved around whether changes in perfusion could alter delivery, uptake, or washout of the radiotracer [C-11]PBR28, and thereby influence outcome measures that affect interpretation of TSPO upregulation. In this simultaneous PET/MRI study, we demonstrate that [C-11]PBR28 signal elevations in chronic low back pain patients are not accompanied, in the same regions, by increases in cerebral blood flow (CBF) compared to healthy controls, and that areas of marginal hypoperfusion are not accompanied by decreases in [C-11]PBR28 signal. In non-human primates, we show that hypercapnia-induced increases in CBF during radiotracer delivery or washout do not alter [C-11]PBR28 outcome measures. The combined results from two methodologically distinct experiments provide support from human data and direct experimental evidence from non-human primates that changes in CBF do not influence outcome measures reported by [C-11]PBR28 PET imaging studies and corresponding interpretations of the biological meaning of TSPO upregulation.

In order to fully understand its role in different diseases and to monitor treatments aiming at reversing this process, it would be valuable to have PET radiotracers that can detect and quantify molecular changes involved in demyelination such as the uncovering and upregulation of the axonal potassium channels K(v)1.1 and K(v)1.2. Carbon-11 labeled radiotracers present the advantage of allowing for multiple scans on the same subject in the same day. Here, we describe [C-11]3MeO4AP, a novel C-11-labeled version of the K+ channel tracer [F-18]3F4AP, and characterize its imaging properties in two non-human primates including a monkey with a focal brain injury sustained during a surgical procedure 3 years prior to imaging. Our findings show that [C-11]3MeO4AP is brain permeable, metabolically stable and has high plasma availability. When compared with [F-18]3F4AP, [C-11]3MeO4AP shows very high correlation in volumes of distribution (V-T), confirming a common target. [C-11]3MeO4AP shows slower washout than [F-18]3F4AP, suggesting stronger binding. Finally, similar to [F-18]3F4AP, [C-11]3MeO4AP is highly sensitive to the focal brain injury. All these features make it a promising radioligand for imaging demyelinated lesions.

Risk management through fish market regulation has existed in Cuba for decades and consists of bans on selected species above a certain weight; however, the actual occurrence of ciguatoxins (CTXs) in seafood has never been verified. From this food safety risk management perspective, a study site locally known to be at risk for ciguatera was selected. Analysis of the epiphytic dinoflagellate community identified the microalga Gambierdiscus. Gambierdiscus species included six of the seven species known to be present in Cuba (G. caribaeus, G. belizeanus, G. carpenteri, G. carolinianus, G. silvae, and F. ruetzleri). CTX-like activity in invertebrates, herbivorous and carnivorous fishes were analyzed with a radioligand receptor-binding assay and, for selected samples, with the N2A cell cytotoxicity assay. CTX activity was found in 80% of the organisms sampled, with toxin values ranging from 2 to 8 ng CTX3C equivalents g(-1) tissue. Data analysis further confirmed CTXs trophic magnification. This study constitutes the first finding of CTX-like activity in marine organisms in Cuba and in herbivorous fish in the Caribbean. Elucidating the structure-activity relationship and toxicology of CTX from the Caribbean is needed before conclusions may be drawn about risk exposure in Cuba and the wider Caribbean.

In this study, we aimed to develop probes with higher affinity for the sigma-1 receptor. For this purpose, we synthesized and evaluated compounds, namely, vesamicol derivatives, in which alkyl chains of varying chain length were introduced between a piperazine ring and a benzene ring. The binding affinity of the vesamicol derivatives for the sigma-1 receptor tended to increase depending on the length of the alkyl chain between the benzene ring and the piperazine ring. The sigma-1 receptor of 2-(4-(3-phenylpropyl)piperazin-1-yl)cyclohexan-1-ol (5) (K-i=5.8 nM) exhibited the highest binding affinity; therefore, we introduced radioiodine into the benzene ring in 5. The radioiodine labeled probe [I-125]2-(4-(3-(4-iodophenyl)propyl) piperazin-1-yl)cyclohexan-1-ol ([I-125] 10) showed high accumulation in the sigma-1 receptor expressing DU-145 cells both in vitro and in vivo. Co-injection of [I-125] 10 with an excess level of a sigma receptor ligand, haloperidol, resulted in a significant decrease in the tumor accumulation in vitro and in vivo, indicating sigma receptor-mediated tumor uptake. These results provide useful information for developing sigma-1 receptor imaging probes.

FOLIA NEUROPATHOLOGICA			English	Article						neurokinin (tachykinin); receptor binding; radioligand; GPCR monomer; dimer; allosteric modulation	FUNCTIONAL SELECTIVITY; NEUROKININ-1 RECEPTORS; CHIMERIC PEPTIDE; HIGH-AFFINITY; ANTAGONIST; AGONIST; GLY-LEU-MET-NH2; CONFORMATION; INHIBITION; TRIPEPTIDE	In the present paper, we report the synthesis, radiolabeling and comprehensive pharmacological evaluation of a C-terminally truncated tachykinin derivative, H-3-KFFGLM-NH2. The C-terminal fragments of endogenous tachykinins are pharmacophores responsible for interaction with the tachykinin receptors NK1, NK2 and NK3. The N-terminal fragments are responsible for modulation of receptor selectivity and interactions with other receptor systems. To evaluate and separate the function of an NK-pharmacophore from the activity of its parent neurokinin, KFFGLM-NH2 was synthesized in both tritiated and unlabeled forms. It has been proposed that the obtained NK-binding profiles of specific reference ligands and KFFGLM-NH2 differentiate monomeric and dimeric forms of NK receptors. We hypothesize that dimers of NK receptors could be specific receptor(s) for C-terminal fragments of all neurokinins as well as their C-terminal fragments, including H-KFFGLM-NH2. Dissociation of dimers into monomers opens access to additional allosteric binding sites. Fully elongated undecapeptide substance P interacts with both the "tachykinin pocket" and the "allosteric pocket" on the monomeric NK1 receptor, resulting in high and selective activation. However C-terminal hexapeptide fragment analogues, recognizing only the "tachykinin pocket", may have less specific interactions with all tachykinin receptors in both monomeric and dimeric forms.

The selective 5-HT1BR antagonist radioligand, [C-11]P943, permits in vivo assessment of central 5-HT1BR binding potential (BPND) with positron emission tomography. Because of its central role in AD, we were particularly interested in ventral striatal 5-HT1BR BPND values. Methods: Twelve medication-free, recently abstinent (at least 4 weeks) patients with AD (mean age 35.2 +/- 10.2 years, 5 women) and 12 healthy control subjects (HC) (mean age 30.6 +/- 9.2 years, 5 women) completed [C-11]P943 positron emission tomography on a high-resolution research tomograph. Individual magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected to exclude individuals with anatomical abnormalities and for coregistration. Imaging data were analyzed with a multilinear reference tissue model. Results: Ventral striatal 5-HT1BR BPND values (2.01 +/- .57% and 1.55 +/- .09%, respectively; 29% between-group difference, p = .006) were increased in AD compared with HC subjects. No influence of demographic or clinical variables or amount of injected radiotracer was observed. Conclusions: This study provides the first evidence that AD in humans is, like in rodent models, associated with increased levels of ventral striatal 5-HT(1B)Rs.

Substantial evidence has demonstrated that voltage-gated Na+ channels in the membrane of damaged nerves play a key role in the establishment and maintenance of pathological neuronal excitability not only of these peripheral nerves but also in the second- and third-order neurons in the pain pathway to the cerebral cortex. Na+ channel blocking drugs have been used in treating neuropathic pain with limited success mainly because of a preponderance of side-effects. We have developed an analogue of mexiletine which is approximately 80 times more potent than mexiletine in competing with the radioligand, H-3-batrachotoxinin for binding to Na+ channels in rat brain membranes and also it is much more lipophilic than mexiletine which should enhance its uptake into the brain to block the increased expression of Na+ channels on second- and third-order neurons of the pain pathway. This analogue, HFI-1, has been tested in three different rat models of neuropathic pain (formalin paw model, ligated spinal nerve model and contusive spinal cord injury model) and found to be more effective in reducing pain behaviours than mexiletine.

Hawthorn (<i>Crataegus monogyna</i> Jacq.) extract exhibits atropine-sensitive activity in a cultured cardiomyocyte assay	JOURNAL OF NATURAL MEDICINES			English	Article						Hawthorn; Neonatal cardiomyocyte; Atropine; Himbacine; [H-3]-QNB	MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR; 5-HT2 ANTAGONISTS; CARDIAC MYOCYTES; HEART-FAILURE; RAT-HEART; ACETYLCHOLINE; BINDING; WS(R)-1442; AFFINITY; STRESS	Hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) plant extract is used as a herbal alternative medicine for the prevention and treatment of various cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it was shown that hawthorn extract preparations caused negative chronotropic effects in a cultured neonatal murine cardiomyocyte assay, independent of beta-adrenergic receptor blockade. The aim of this study was to further characterize the effect of hawthorn extract to decrease the contraction rate of cultured cardiomyocytes. To test the hypothesis that hawthorn is acting via muscarinic receptors, the effect of hawthorn extract on atrial versus ventricular cardiomyocytes in culture was evaluated. As would be expected for activation of muscarinic receptors, hawthorn extract had a greater effect in atrial cells. Atrial and/or ventricular cardiomyocytes were then treated with hawthorn extract in the presence of atropine or himbacine. Changes in the contraction rate of cultured cardiomyocytes revealed that both muscarinic antagonists significantly attenuated the negative chronotropic activity of hawthorn extract. Using quinuclidinyl benzilate, L-[benzylic-4,4'-H-3] ([H-3]-QNB) as a radioligand antagonist, the effect of a partially purified hawthorn extract fraction to inhibit muscarinic receptor binding was quantified. Hawthorn extract fraction 3 dose-dependently inhibited [H-3]-QNB binding to mouse heart membranes. Taken together, these findings suggest that decreased contraction frequency by hawthorn extracts in neonatal murine cardiomyocytes may be mediated via muscarinic receptor activation.

The crucial reaction step in the chiral pool synthesis was the establishment of the three carbon bridge by a Dieckmann analogous cyclization of the allyl and propyl derivatives 6 and 7 to yield the mixed methyl silyl acetals 8 and 9, respectively. Stereoselective Grignard reaction, dehydration, and introduction of the pharmacophoric (N,N-diethylcarbamoylbenzyl) residue led to the designed delta receptor agonists 3, ent-3, and 20 with a double bond in the bicyclic framework. Hydrogenation of the allyl derivative 14 was performed with ammonium formate and Pd/C to yield the saturated ligands 24a and 24b. Removal of the allyl substituent with RhCl3, hydrogenation of the ring system, and re-attachment of the allyl moiety provided the allyl derivatives 4a and 4b. In receptor binding studies with the radioligand [H-3]-deltorphine II only ent-3 showed considerable 8 receptor affinity (K-i = 740 nM). Since ent-3 also interacts with mu receptors (K-i = 250 nM) it belongs to the very interesting compound class of mixed delta/mu ligands. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We compared its effects with those of memantine, a well-studied pore blocker of NMDA receptors, currently used in therapeutics for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Our results indicate that both compounds block acetylcboline-evoked responses at micromolar concentrations with a rank order of potency of neramexane > memantine, P < 0.05. Block by neramexane of acetylcholine responses was not overcome at high concentrations of the agonist, indicative of a non-competitive inhibition. The lack of interaction of neramexane with the ligand binding domain was confirmed by radioligand binding experiments in transfected tsA201 cells. Moreover, block did not involve an increase in desensitization kinetics, it was independent of the resting potential of the membrane at low concentrations of neramexane and slightly voltage-dependent at concentrations higher than 1 mu M. Finally, clinically-relevant concentrations of neramexane blocked native alpha 9 alpha O-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ofrat inner hair cells, thus demonstrating a possible in vivo relevance in potentially unexplored therapeutic areas.

On this basis, the tritiated compound was examined for its utility in autoradiography to localize the 5-HT1F receptor in rat and guinea pig brain regions. Specific 5-HT1F receptor binding in rat brain was found in layers 4 - 5 of all cortical regions examined, as well as olfactory bulb and tubercle, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, medial mammillary nucleus, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, subiculum, and several amygdaloid nuclei. In guinea pig brain, the [H-3] LY334370 binding sites were found at highest density in claustrum, but also in a layer of the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and medial mammillary nucleus. Some species differences in the distribution of the 5-HT1F receptor were noted. Side by side comparison of rat brain autoradiography with [H-3] LY334370 and [H-3] sumatriptan showed labeling in the same brain regions. Preliminary binding studies in rhesus monkey and human brain sections showed [H-3] LY334370 binding in cortical layers 4-5, subiculum ( in the monkey), and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. These findings suggest a discrete localization of the 5-HT1F receptor in the rat, guinea pig, monkey and human brain, and confirms the utility of [H-3] LY334370 as a potential tool to explore further the localization and possible functions of the 5-HT1F receptor.

Modulating agents are currently marketed in Japan and under clinical evaluation in the US, but full characterization of the thromboxane A(2) receptor and the signaling pathways that link it to the proliferative events taking place during airways structural remodeling has not been achieved. Here, we report that the presence of mRNA for both a and isoforms of the thromboxane A(2) receptor in smooth muscle cells from human bronchi correlates with protein expression evaluated by radioligand binding of the antagonist, SQ29,548 ([1S-[1alpha,2alpha(Z),3alpha,4alpha]]-7-[3-[[2-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]hydrazino]methyl]-7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-yl]-5-heptenoic-acid) (K-d=3.4 nM +/- 44%CV, coefficient of variation, B-max=41 fmol/mg prot +/- 38%CV). The receptor is functional, as the agonist, U46619 (9,11-dideoxy-9alpha,11alpha-methanoepoxy-prosta-5Z,13E-dien-1-oic-acid), induced a concentration-dependent Ca2+ transient (EC50=0.12 muM +/- 27%CV). Furthermore, U46619 concentration dependently increased DNA synthesis and markedly potentiated the epidermal growth factor mitogenic effect. Both events were specifically inhibited by SQ29,548, independently from transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and partially sensitive to pertussis toxin. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Previous data from our laboratory, using cultured cell lines, indicated that cisplatin increases the expression of the adenosine A(1) receptor subtype through generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Since the adenosine A(1) receptor plays an important role in normal renal physiology, this study was performed to determine whether cisplatin modulates adenosine A(1) receptor expression in vivo and whether these receptors play a role in the nephrotoxicity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, treated with cisplatin (8 mg/kg), developed nephrotoxicity within 3 days, as demonstrated by increased serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, Cisplatin also produced a significant increase in malondialdehyde, apoptosis and necrosis in the kidney. The above changes were associated with a time-dependent increase in the expression of adenosine A(1) receptor, as determined by radioligand binding assays, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry, and an increase in adenosine A(1) receptor transcripts, Administration of selective and nonselective antagonists of the adenosine A(1) receptor produced either no change or exacerbated the nephrotoxicity produced by cisplatin. These data indicate that cisplatin can regulate the adenosine A(1) receptor in the kidney and suggest a cytoprotective role of this receptor subtype against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity.

The aim of the present study was to develop a radioligand binding assay for 3 beta HSD autoantibodies and to exploit this to examine regions of the molecule targeted by autoantibodies. We generated a construct of 3 beta HSD coupled to a luciferase fusion partner in order to maximize the yield of (35)S-radiolabeled protein. Labeled 3 beta HSD was then immunoprecipitated and the autoantibodies quantified by phosphoimaging. Auto-antibodies to 3 beta HSD were detected in 12 of 100 (12%) idiopathic premature ovarian failure patients and 0 of 103 (0%) healthy age-matched controls (P < 0.0001). Three overlapping fragments of 3 beta HSD cDNA were cloned downstream of luciferase to examine autoantibody binding sites. Two of nine sera with 3 beta HSD autoantibodies (22%) displayed reactivity to the N terminus of 3 beta HSD, and seven (77%) showed reactivity to the C terminal; no sera reacted with the middle region. Our study demonstrates a markedly enhanced disease specificity of autoantibodies to 3 beta HSD detected using this novel assay and shows that distinct regions of the molecule are targeted.

The copious literature on nAChRs is related to the pharmacological profile of new, promising subtype selective derivatives as well as the encouraging preclinical and early clinical evaluation of known ligands. However, recently approved therapeutic derivatives are still missing, and examples of ligands discontinued in advanced CNS clinical trials include drug candidates acting at both neuronal homomeric and heteromeric receptors. In this review, we have selected heteromeric nAChRs as the target and comment on literature reports of the past five years dealing with the discovery of new small molecule ligands or the advanced pharmacological/preclinical investigation of more promising compounds. The results obtained with bifunctional nicotinic ligands and a light-activated ligand as well as the applications of promising radiopharmaceuticals for heteromeric subtypes are also discussed.

We introduce the clinical profile of advanced metastatic PCa in terms of common genetic alterations. Findings from recently developed models of PCa metastatic spread are discussed, focusing mainly on the role of the TME (mainly matrix and fibroblast cell types), at distinct stages: premetastatic niche orchestrated by the primary tumor towards the metastatic site and bone metastasis. We report evidence of premetastatic niche formation, such as the mechanisms of distant site conditioning by extracellular vesicles, chemokines and other tumor-derived mechanisms, including altered cancer cell-ECM interactions. Furthermore, evidence supporting the similarities of stroma alterations among the primary PCa and bone metastasis, and contribution of TME to androgen deprivation therapy resistance are also discussed. We summarize the available bone metastasis transgenic mouse models of PCa from a perspective of pro-metastatic TME alterations during disease progression and give an update on the current diagnostic and therapeutic radiological strategies for bone metastasis clinical management.

Using membrane receptors as a stationary phase, the CMC method helps in determining the binding characteristics between ligands and membrane receptors and in efficiently identifying specific target components in a complex sample that produce the cellular biological effects of ligands (drugs, antibodies, enzymes, cytokines, etc.). CMC is an analytical tool for revealing characteristics of ligand-receptor interactions, screening and discovering target substances, and accurately controlling the quality of drugs. Since establishment of CMC in the early 1990s, with the rapid development of cell biology, significant progress has been made in the development of high-expression receptors, engineered cell cultures, and standardized preparations, which allowed in vitro immobilization of cell membrane receptors and miniaturization of binding assays. A variety of CMC models have been established using different membrane receptors as a stationary phase, and many new methods have been developed by combining CMC with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/mass spectrometry or HPLC-IT-TOF technologies. CMC methods have been widely used to study drug-receptor interactions and to screen complex samples for effective or harmful components. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In vivo imaging of this receptor in the canine brain could improve diagnosis and therapy of several behavioural disorders in dogs. Furthermore, since dogs are considered as a valuable animal model for human psychiatric disorders, the ability to image this receptor in dogs could help to increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases. Therefore, five healthy laboratory beagles underwent a 90-min dynamic PET scan with arterial blood sampling after [F-18] altanserin bolus injection. Compartmental modelling using metabolite corrected arterial input functions was compared with reference tissue modelling with the cerebellum as reference region. Results The distribution of [F-18] altanserin in the canine brain corresponded well to the distribution of 5-HT2A receptors in human and rodent studies. The kinetics could be best described by a 2-Tissue compartment (2-TC) model. All reference tissue models were highly correlated with the 2-TC model, indicating compartmental modelling can be replaced by reference tissue models to avoid arterial blood sampling. Conclusions This study demonstrates that [F-18] altanserin PET is a reliable tool to visualize and quantify the 5-HT2A receptor in the canine brain.

The endogenous mu-opioid receptor (MOR) system is involved in rewarding aspects of both food and physical exercise, yet interaction between endogenous opioid release following exercise and anticipatory food reward remains unresolved. Here we tested whether exercise-induced opioid release correlates with increased anticipatory reward processing in humans. We scanned 24 healthy lean men after rest and after a 1 h session of aerobic exercise with positron emission tomography (PET) using MOR-selective radioligand [C-11]carfentanil. After both PET scans, the subjects underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment where they viewed pictures of palatable versus nonpalatable foods to trigger anticipatory food reward responses. Exercise-induced changes in MOR binding in key regions of reward circuit (amygdala, thalamus, ventral and dorsal striatum, and orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices) were used to predict the changes in anticipatory reward responses in fMRI. Exercise-induced changes in MOR binding correlated negatively with the exercise-induced changes in neural anticipatory food reward responses in orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices, insula, ventral striatum, amygdala, and thalamus: higher exercise-induced opioid release predicted higher brain responses to palatable versus nonpalatable foods. We conclude that MOR activation following exercise may contribute to the considerable interindividual variation in food craving and consumption after exercise, which might promote compensatory eating and compromise weight control.

However, 10% to 50% and 20% to 65% of the patients will experience biochemical recurrence within 15 years following RP and RT, respectively. According to the results of watchful waiting policy, the median time from biochemical recurrence to development of distant metastases is 3 years, more or less, which pushes clinicians to apply further curative local salvage therapy (LST). LST via various surgical (salvage RP) and non-surgical (high-intensity focused ultrasound, re-brachytherapy, cryotherapy, etc.) options can be offered in this setting. We present a case of locally recurrent PCa after brachytherapy. Considering our patients' body habitus, relatively young age, and marital status (just recently married), sexual side effects of androgen deprivation therapy, local adhesions induced by brachytherapy and prior abdominopelvic surgeries, the lack of institutional experience on cryotherapy/high-intensity focused ultrasound, and the risk of metastatic progression associated with watchful waiting, theranostic application of lutetium-177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen imaging and therapy was offered. To the best of our knowledge, this case represents the first example of the successful theranostic application of lutetium-177-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen, as a LST option in the setting of locally recurrent PCa following curative intent brachytherapy for organ-confined PCa.

They are signaling through three distinct types of receptors: tropomyosin receptor kinase family (TrkA/B/C), p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) and sortilin. Aberrant expression of p75(NTR) in the CNS is implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The goal of this work was to evaluate one of the very few reported p75(NTR) small molecule ligands as a lead compound for development of novel PET radiotracers for in vivo p75(NTR) imaging. Here we report that previously described ligand LM11A-24 shows significant inhibition of carbachol-induced persistent firing (PF) of entorhinal cortex (EC) pyramidal neurons in wild-type mice via selective interaction with p75(NTR). Based on this electrophysiological assay, the compound has very high potency with an EC50 <10 nM. We optimized the radiosynthesis of [C-11]LM11A-24 as the first attempt to develop PET radioligand for in vivo imaging of p75(NTR). Despite some weak interaction with CNS tissues, the radiolabeled compound showed unfavorable in vivo profile presumably due to high hydrophilicity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Agonists bind preferentially to the high-affinity state of the dopamine D2R, which has been proposed as the reason why agonists are more sensitive to detect dopamine release than antagonist radiopharmaceuticals, but this theory has been challenged. Interestingly, not all agonists similarly activate the classic cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) and the beta-arrestin-2 pathway, some stimulate preferentially one of these pathways; a phenomenon called biased agonism. Because these pathways can be affected separately by pathologies or drugs (including dopamine releasers), it is important to know how agonist radiotracers act on these pathways. Therefore, we characterized the intracellular signalling of the well-known D2/3R agonist radiopharmaceuticals NPA and PHNO and of several novel D2/3R agonists. Methods: cAMP accumulation and beta-arrestin-2 recruitment were measured on cells expressing human D2R. Results: All tested agonists showed (almost) full agonism in both pathways. Conclusions: The tested D2/3R agonist radiopharmaceuticals did not exhibit biased agonism in vitro. Consequently, it is likely that drugs (including psychostimulants like amphetamines) and/or pathologies that influence the cAMP and/or the beta-arrestin-2 pathway may influence the binding of these radiopharmaceuticals.

Climate, in particular sunshine, influences mood and energy levels, creating a positive upswing of mood on bright, sunny days and negative downswing in cold, dark winter seasons. Higher serotonin transporter availability in healthy human subjects in times of lesser light exposure and lower serotonin levels have been shown in winter. Methods. We examined the light-dependent variations in serotonin-1A receptor binding in limbic regions in 36 drug-naive healthy human subjects. Receptor binding was quantified using positron emission tomography and the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635. Binding potential values were related to the amount of individual exposure to sunlight (daily duration of sunshine) and global radiation (total light intensity). Results. We found a 20-30% lower serotonin-1A receptor binding in the group exposed to a lower amount of global light radiation. Partial correlation analysis revealed significant positive correlations between the regional postsynaptic serotonin-1A receptor binding and global radiation accumulated over a period of 5 days. Conclusions. Seasonal factors, such as daily amount of sunshine and global radiation, influence serotonin-1A receptor binding in limbic brain regions of healthy human subjects. Combined with recently demonstrated seasonal fluctuations in the serotonin transporter availability, our results underline the importance of seasonal factors in the regulation of the serotonergic transmission.

Decreased Neurokinin-1 (Substance P) Receptor Binding in Patients with Panic Disorder: Positron Emission Tomographic Study with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]SPA-RQ	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						NK1; receptor; panic attack; panic disorder; positron emission tomography (PET); substance P	HUMAN BRAIN; NK1 RECEPTORS; ANTAGONIST; STRESS; PET; ANXIETY; PHOBIA	Background: Positron emission tomography (PET) can localize and quantify neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors in brain using the nonpeptide antagonist radioligand, [F-18]SPA-RQ. We sought to determine if patients with panic disorder have altered density of INK, receptors in brain because of their history of recurrent panic attacks. We also sought to determine if a drug-induced panic attack releases substance P in brain, as measured by decreased binding of [F-18]SPA-RQ. Methods: Positron emission tomography scans with [F-18]SPA-RQ were performed in 14 patients with panic disorder and 14 healthy subjects. Of these two groups, 7 patients and 10 healthy subjects were scanned twice, once at baseline and once after injection of doxapram, a drug that induces panic attacks. Results: NK1 receptor binding in patients (n = 14) compared with that in healthy subjects (n = 14) was significantly decreased by 12% to 21% in all brain regions. Doxapram effectively produced panic attacks in 6 of 7 patients with panic disorder but only 2 of 10 healthy subjects. Doxapram caused no significant change of [F-18]SPA-RQ binding in either patients or healthy subjects. Conclusions: Although induction of a panic attack has no significant effect on [F-18]SPA-RQ binding to NK1 receptors, patients with panic disorder have widespread reduction of NK1 receptor binding in brain.

Dopamine Release in Dissociable Striatal Subregions Predicts the Different Effects of Oral Methylphenidate on Reversal Learning and Spatial Working Memory	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE LESIONS; LOBE LESIONS; ATTENTION; RECEPTORS	Previous data suggest that methylphenidate can have variable effects on different cognitive tasks both within and between individuals. This is thought to be underpinned by inverted U-shaped relationships between cognitive performance and dopaminergic activity in relatively separate fronto-striatal circuits and reflected by individual differences in trait impulsivity. Direct evidence for this is currently lacking. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that therapeutic doses of oral methylphenidate administered to young healthy subjects result in different sized changes in D-2/D-3 receptor availability in different regions of the human striatum and that the change in receptor availability within an individual subregion predicts cognitive performance on a particular task. Methylphenidate produced significantly different effects on reversal learning and spatial working memory tasks within individuals. Performance on the reversal learning task was predicted by the drug-induced change in D-2/D-3 receptor availability in postcommissural caudate, measured using [C-11]-raclopride radioligand PET imaging, whereas performance on the spatial working memory task was predicted by changes in receptor availability in the ventral striatum. Reversal learning performance was also predicted by subjects' trait impulsivity, such that the most impulsive individuals benefited more from methylphenidate, consistent with this drug's beneficial effects on cognition in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

Intact coupling of M1 receptors and preserved M2 and M4 receptors in the cortex in progressive supranuclear palsy: Contrast with other dementias	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL NEUROANATOMY			English	Article						progressive supranuclear palsy; cholinergic; muscarinic receptors; frontal cortex	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN-BRAIN; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; LEWY BODIES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CINGULATE CORTEX; G-PROTEINS; ACETYLCHOLINE; SUBTYPES	Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disease characterised clinically by motor and cognitive symptoms. Cholinergic dysfunction is thought to be responsible for much of the cognitive symptomatology. To date, however, cholinergic replacement therapies have been ineffective. We used receptor specific radioligand autoradiography to measure M1, M2, and M4 receptor density, and the functional status of the principal cortical subtype, M1, in the frontal cortex in post-mortem brain tissue of PSP patients (n = 14). Results were compared to normal controls (n = 17) and patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n = 12) and Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 15). In PSP there were no changes in M1, M2, or M4 muscarinic receptor densities or M1 coupling. DLB cases showed a non-significant increase in M1 receptors. In AD there was a reduction in M1 receptors and coupling in most frontal cortical areas which reached significance, compared to DLB, for M1 receptors in the cingulate (p < 0.05). We conclude from this first systematic study of cortical muscarinic receptors in PSP that functioning cortical muscarinic receptors are preserved. A further, larger trial of cholinergic therapy, such as an M1 agonist, may be warranted. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Functional production of recombinant GPCRs is one of the main bottlenecks to obtaining structural information. Here, we report the use of a novel bacterial expression system based on the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides for the production of human recombinant GPCRs. The advantage of employing R. sphaeroides as a host lies in the fact that it provides much more membrane surface per cell compared to other typical expression hosts. The system was tailored to overexpress recombinant receptors under the control of the moderately strong and highly regulated superoperonic photosynthetic promoter pufQ. We tested this system for the expression of some class A GPCRs, namely, the human adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR), the human angiotensin AT1a receptor (AT1aR) and the human bradykinin B2 receptor (B2R). Several different constructs were examined and functional production of the recombinant receptors was achieved. The best-expressed receptor, AT1aR, was solubilized and affinity-purified. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of successful use of a bacterial host - R. sphaeroides - to produce functional recombinant GPCRs under the control of a photosynthetic gene promoter.

J. Dandliker et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 47:3831-3839, 2003). Footprinting experiments, using a range of NRIs and chemical modification agents on Escherichia coli ribosomes, revealed no evidence for direct protection of rRNA. In the presence of tRNA, however, we found that NRIs enhanced the known ribosomal footprinting pattern of tRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The most prominent increase in protection, at A1492/3 and A1413 in helix-44 of 16S RNA, strictly required the presence of IRNA and poly(U), and the effect was correlated with the potency of the inhibitor. Radioligand binding studies with inhibitor [H-3]A-424902 showed that the compound binds to tRNA, either in its charged or uncharged form. The dissociation constant for [H-3]A-424902 binding to Phe-tRNA(Phe), was determined to be 1.8 mu M, near its translation inhibition potency of 1.6 mu M in a cell-free S. pneumoniae extract assay. The compound did not change the binding of radiolabeled tRNA to the 30S ribosomal subunit. Taken together, these results imply that the NRIs exert their effects on protein synthesis by structurally perturbing the tRNA/30S complex at the decoding site.

[H-3]SCH23390 binding to D-1-like receptors was not changed by any drug treatments. There were significant increases in [H-3]nemonapride binding to D-2-like receptors at different time points due to treatment with haloperidol, chlorpromazine and olanzapine. By contrast, treatment with clozapine and olanzapine caused a time-dependent decrease in [H-3]muscimol binding to the GABAA receptor. These data suggest that treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs, but not typical antipsychotic drugs, affect striatal GABAergic neurons. In addition, it would appear that clozapine might be unique in that it does not increase dopamine-D-2 like receptor density at doses which would be predicted to have antipsychotic effects in humans. The extent to which such changes are involved in the therapeutic effects of drugs such as olanzapine and clozapine remains to be determined. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We evaluated the binding of both radioligands to human postmortem frontal cortex membranes. Saturation binding analyses revealed that [H-3]idazoxan tin the presence of 2 muM efaroxan to avoid radioligand binding to alpha (2)-adrenoceptors and imidazoline I-1 receptors) and [H-3]2-BFI bound with high affinity to an apparent single population of sites. However, in competition studies whereas [H-3]idazoxan (10 nM) binding was displaced monophasically by idazoxan and 2-BFI, both drugs displayed biphasic curves for [H-3]2-BFI (1 nM). The proportion of the low-affinity binding site increased from 17% to 25% when 10 nM [3H]2-BFI was displaced by idazoxan. Amiloride inhibited [H-3]2-BFI(10 nM) binding with low affinity and in a monophasic way. These data indicate that [H-3]2-BFI recognises in human postmortem brain membranes a second binding site different from the imidazoline I? receptors labelled by [H-3]idazoxan.

PiB PET may thus underestimate total amyloid burden in patients with FAD and abundant cotton wool plaques. Individuals with familial Alzheimer's disease due to PSEN1 mutations develop high cortical fibrillar amyloid-beta load but often have lower cortical C-11-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) retention than Individuals with sporadic Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized this is influenced by limited interactions of Pittsburgh compound B with cotton wool plaques, an amyloid-beta plaque type common in familial Alzheimer's disease but rare in sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Histological sections of frontal and temporal cortex, caudate nucleus and cerebellum were obtained from 14 cases with sporadic Alzheimer's disease, 12 cases with familial Alzheimer's disease due to PSEN1 mutations, two relatives of a PSEN1 mutation carrier but without genotype information and three non-Alzheimer's disease cases. Sections were processed immunohistochemically using amyloid-beta-targeting antibodies and the fluorescent amyloid stains cyano-PiB and X-34. Plaque load was quantified by percentage area analysis. Frozen homogenates from the same brain regions from five sporadic Alzheimer's disease and three familial Alzheimer's disease cases were analysed for H-3-PiB in vitro binding and concentrations of amyloid-beta 1-40 and amyloid-beta 1-42. Nine sporadic Alzheimer's disease, three familial Alzheimer's disease and three non-Alzheimer's disease participants had C-11-PiB PET with standardized uptake value ratios calculated using the cerebellum as the reference region. Cotton wool plaques were present in the neocortex of all familial Alzheimer's disease cases and one sporadic Alzheimer's disease case, in the caudate nucleus from four familial Alzheimer's disease cases, but not in the cerebellum. Cotton wool plaques immunolabelled robustly with 4G8 and amyloid-beta 42 antibodies but weakly with amyloid-beta 40 and amyloid-beta N3pE antibodies and had only background cyano-PiB fluorescence despite labelling with X-34. Relative to amyloid-beta plaque load, cyano-Pittsburgh compound B plaque load was similar in sporadic Alzheimer's disease while in familial Alzheimer's disease it was lower in the neocortex and the caudate nucleus. In both regions, insoluble amyloid-beta 1-42 and amyloid-beta 1-40 concentrations were similar in familial Alzheimer's disease and sporadic Alzheimer's disease groups, while H-3-PiB binding was lower in the familial Alzheimer's disease than the sporadic Alzheimer's disease group. Higher amyloid-beta 1-42 concentration associated with higher H-3-PiB binding in sporadic Alzheimer's disease but not familial Alzheimer's disease. C-11-PiB retention correlated with region-matched post-mortem amyloid-beta plaque load; however, familial Alzheimer's disease cases with abundant cotton wool plaques had lower C-11-PiB retention than sporadic Alzheimer's disease cases with similar amyloid-beta plaque loads. PiB has limited ability to detect amyloid-beta aggregates in cotton wool plaques and may underestimate total amyloid-beta plaque burden in brain regions with abundant cotton wool plaques.

Managing these patients are currently challenging. Hence, there is an unmet need for further efficient therapeutic options that induce anti-tumor activity and improve survival. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and therapeutic efficacy of Ac-225-PSMA-617 targeted alpha therapy (TAT) in mCRPC patients in real-world conditions. Methods: In this prospective study, we recruited patients with mCRPC who either were refractory to Lu-177-PSMA-617 radioligand therapy (RLT) or did not receive previous Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT. Patients were treated with Ac-225-PSMA-617 TAT (100 KBq/Kg body weight) at 8-weekly intervals. The primary endpoint included the assessment of biochemical response by measuring the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate as per the prostate cancer working group criteria (PCWG3). Secondary endpoints comprised the estimation of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), molecular tumor response assessment (PERCIST 1 criteria), disease control rate (DCR), toxicity according to CTCAE v5.0, and clinical response evaluation. Results: A total of 28 patients were recruited for this cohort study among whom 15 (54%) received prior Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT and the remaining 13 (46%) patients were Lu-177-PSMA-617 RLT naive. The mean age was 69.7 years (range: 46-87 years). All patients, except one, had extensive skeletal metastases on baseline Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan; one patient had lymph node dominant disease and advanced primary prostatic tumor. The mean activity administered was 26.5 +/- 12 MBq (range: 9.25 - 62.9 MBq) [715.5 +/- 327 mu Ci, range: 250 - 1700 mu Ci] with a median of 3 cycles (range: 1 - 7 cycles). At 8th week of post first cycle of Ac-225-PSMA-617 therapy (initial follow-up) and the end of the follow-up, >50% decline in PSA was observed in 25% and 39%, respectively. The median PFS and OS were 12 months (95% CI: 9 - 13 months) and 17 months (95% CI: 16 months - upper limit not reached), respectively. Molecular tumor response by PERCIST 1 criteria could be conducted in 22/28 (78.6%) patients, which revealed complete response in 2/22 (9%), partial response in 10/22 (45.4%) patients, 2/22 (9%) with stable disease, and 8/22 (36%) with progressive diseases. The disease control rate, according to the biochemical and molecular tumor response criteria, was 82% and 63.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed PSA progression as adverse prognostic indicator of OS, and any PSA decline as a good prognostic indicator of PFS. There was no Grade III/IV toxicity noted in this series. The most common side-effect was transient fatigue (50%) followed by grade I/II xerostomia (29%). Conclusion: Ac-225-PSMA-617 TAT showed promising disease control rate, even when all other therapeutic options were exhausted, with low treatment-related toxicities.

A Structure-Activity Relationship Comparison of Imidazodiazepines Binding at Kappa, Mu, and Delta Opioid Receptors and the GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptor	MOLECULES			English	Article						opioid receptor; imidazodiazepine; GABA(A)receptor	PAIN; IMIDAZOBENZODIAZEPINES; FLUORINE; INSIGHTS; LIGANDS; RAT	Analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties mediated by the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) have been reported for oxadiazole imidazodiazepines. Affinities determined by radioligand competition assays of more than seventy imidazodiazepines using cell homogenates from HEK293 cells that overexpress KOR, mu opioid receptor (MOR), and delta opioid receptor (DOR) are presented. Affinities to synaptic, benzodiazepine-sensitive receptors (BZR) were determined with rat brain extract. The highest affinity for KOR was recorded for GL-I-30 (Ki of 27 nM) and G-protein recruitment was observed with an EC(50)of 32 nM. Affinities for MOR and DOR were weak for all compounds. Ester and amide imidazodiazepines were among the most active KOR ligands but also competed with(3)H-flunitrazepam for brain extract binding, which is mediated predominately by gamma aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABA(A)R) of the alpha(1-3)beta(2-3)gamma(1-2)subtypes. Imidazodiazepines with carboxylic acid and primary amide groups did not bind KOR but interacted strongly with GABA(A)Rs. Pyridine substitution reduced KOR affinity. Oxadiazole imidazodiazepines exhibited good KOR binding and interacted weakly with BZR, whereas oxazole imidazodiazepines were more selective towards BZR. Compounds that lack the imidazole moiety, the pendent phenyl, or pyridine substitutions exhibited insignificant KOR affinities. It can be concluded that a subset of imidazodiazepines represents novel KOR ligands with high selectivity among opioid receptors.

Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of Quinoxaline Derivatives for PET Imaging of the NMDA Receptor	HELVETICA CHIMICA ACTA			English	Article						NMDA receptor; GluN2A subunit; [F-18]-labelling; quinoxaline derivatives; PET imaging; heart slices; brain	D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; RED-BLOOD-CELLS; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; 5-AMINOMETHYLQUINOXALINE-2,3-DIONES; RADIOLIGAND; SYSTEM; SITE; AMPA	Due to the biological complexity of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), the development of a positron emission tomography radiotracer for the imaging of NMDAR has met with limited success. Recent studies have established the presence of GluN2A subunit of the NMDAR in the heart and its role in the regulation of intracellular calcium levels. In our efforts to develop an imaging agent for the GluN2A subunit, we designed three new compounds based on a quinoxaline scaffold. The synthesis of the analogues was based on a two-step Kabachnik-Fields reaction in sequence with Suzuki cross-coupling and acid hydrolysis. They exhibited comparable high binding affinity values below 5 nm. A two-step radiolabeling procedure was successfully developed for the synthesis of [F-18]1. [F-18]1 was obtained in a modest overall radiochemical yield of 5.5 +/- 4.2%, a good specific radioactivity of 254 +/- 158 GBq/mol, and a radiochemical purity > 99%. While compounds 2 and 3 showed comparable binding affinity towards NMDAR, sluggish radiolabeling, prevented their further evaluation. For [F-18]1, in vitro autoradiography on rat heart slices demonstrated heterogeneous but unspecific accumulation, whereas for the brain a high in vitro specificity towards NMDAR, could be demonstrated.

DKFZ-PSMA-617, a PSMA targeting ligand reported recently, was chosen to be radio-labeled with nuclide Cu-64. Cu-64-PSMA-617 was radio-synthesized in high radio-chemical yield and specific activity up to 19.3 GBq/mu mol. It showed good stability in vitro. The specificity of Cu-64-PSMA-617 was confirmed by cell uptake experiments in PSMA (+) LNCaP cell and PSMA (-) PC-3 and gastric adenocarcinoma BGC-823 cells. Micro-PET imaging in BGC-823 and PC-3 xenografts nude mice was evaluated (n = 4). And the tumors were visualized and better tumor-to-background achieved till 24 h. Co-administration of N-[[[(1S)-1-Carboxy-3-methylbutyl] amino]-carbonyl]-L-glutamic acid (ZJ-43) can substantially block the uptake in those tumors. Dissected tumor tissues were analyzed by auto-radiography and immunohistochemistry, and these results confirmed the PSMA expression in neo-vasculature which explained the target molecular imaging of Cu-64-PSMA-617. All those results suggested Cu-64-PSMA-617 may serve as a novel radio-tracer for tumor imaging more than prostate cancer.

Here, we tested the claim that pathological accumulation of alpha-synuclein, and subsequent synaptic disruption, occur in absence of dopaminergic neuron loss in PD. We determined early synaptic changes in rats that overexpress human alpha-synuclein by local injection of viral-vectors in midbrain. We aimed to achieve alpha-synuclein levels sufficient to induce terminal pathology without significant loss of nigral neurons. We tested synaptic disruption in vivo by analyzing motor defects and binding of a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand to the vesicular monoamine transporter 2, (VMAT2), [C-11] dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ). Animals overexpressing alpha-synuclein had progressive motor impairment and, 12 weeks post-surgery, showed asymmetric in vivo striatal DTBZ binding. The PET images matched ligand binding in postmortem tissue, and histological markers of dopaminergic integrity. Histology confirmed the absence of nigral cell death with concomitant significant loss of striatal terminals. Progressive aggregation of proteinase-K resistant and Ser129-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein was observed in dopaminergic terminals, in dystrophic swellings that resembled axonal spheroids and contained mitochondria and vesicular proteins. In conclusion, pathological alpha-synuclein in nigro-striatal axonal terminals leads to early axonal pathology, synaptic disruption, dysfunction of dopaminergic neurotransmission, motor impairment, and measurable change of VMAT2 in the absence of cell loss.

Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been reported to have higher efficacy and/or faster acting rate than commonly used antidepressants. The present study was designed to screen the potential SNRIs, using in vitro radioligand receptor binding assays and in vivo animal tests, and introduced the discovery of 071031B. In the tail suspension test and forced swimming test in mice, six compounds (071017S, 071026W, 071031A, 071031B, 080307A and 080307B) showed robust antidepressant activity, without stimulant effect on the locomotor activity or other side effects, and the minimal effective dose of 071017S, 071026W, 071031A and 071031B was less than that of duloxetine; in vitro binding tests indicated that 071031B had high affinity to both serotonin transporter and noradrenaline transporter with similar inhibitory rates to duloxetine at 1 and 100 nM; acute toxicity test indicated that the LD50 value of 071031B was similar to that of duloxetine. These findings demonstrated that this integrated system, combining high throughput screening technology and in vivo animal tests, is effective to screen potential monoamine reuptake inhibitors fast and accurately; 071031B is expected to be a novel serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor for its robust antidepressant activity and transporter affinity.

Our study, aimed at investigating the presence of functional nuclear UT in various rat and monkey tissues as well as in human cell lines, demonstrated for the first time by Western blot analysis and confocal immunofluorescence a tissue-specific nuclear expression of this receptor (heart and central nervous system). This nuclear UT was further characterized pharmacologically through radioligand binding studies using specific ligands of the urotensinergic system, as well as somatostatin. In 2D-gel experiments, we observed the presence of different post-translational modifications between membrane and nuclear UT receptors in brain extracts. Transcription initiation assays showed de novo RNA synthesis caused by UII and Urotensin-related peptide (URP) which were inhibited by an UT antagonist urantide. In hypoxic/ischemic conditions, UT receptors were differentially modulated in regard to subcellular localization. Thus, the unique regiospecificity of the nuclear UT receptor along with its particular modulation under hypoxic conditions could indicate a specific and complementary physiological role that could be correlated with pro-angiogenic and/or neuromodulatory actions of UII, both in the cardiovascular and central nervous system.

In this report, we describe the pharmacological characteristics of MDA7 (1-[(3-benzyl-3-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1-benzofuran-6-yl)carbonyl]piperidine), a novel CB2 receptor agonist. Experimental approach: We characterized the pharmacological profile of MDA7 by using radioligand-binding assays and in vitro functional assays at human cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) and CB2 receptors. In vitro functional assays were performed at rat CB1 and CB2 receptors. The effects of MDA7 in reversing neuropathic pain were assessed in spinal nerve ligation and paclitaxel-induced neuropathy models in rats. Key results: MDA7 exhibited selectivity and agonist affinity at human and rat CB2 receptors. MDA7 treatment attenuated tactile allodynia produced by spinal nerve ligation or by paclitaxel in a dose-related manner. These effects were selectively antagonized by a CB2 receptor antagonist but not by CB1 or opioid receptor antagonists. MDA7 did not affect rat locomotor activity. Conclusion and implications: MDA7, a novel selective CB2 agonist, was effective in suppressing neuropathic nociception in two rat models without affecting locomotor behaviour. These results confirm the potential for CB2 agonists in the treatment of neuropathic pain.

In this study, stable cell lines expressing the ferret dopamine D2-long (D-2L) and D-4 receptors were used to characterize known dopamine agonists via radioligand binding and calcium ion flux assays, while emetic activity of these dopamine receptor agonisis was determined in male ferrets. Latencies to first emetic event, average number of emetic episodes, and stereotypical behaviors which may be indicative of nausea were also determined. Agonists at dopamine D-1-like and D-4 receptors had no emetic effect in ferrets. Conversely, stimulation of dopamine D-2 and/or D-3 receptors resulted in a robust emetic response characterized by a relatively short latency (< 15 min) and multiple emetic events. Competitive antagonists of dopamine, D-2-like receptors (domperidone, haloperidol) dose-dependently blocked the emetic response to PNU95666E, a dopamine D-2 receptor selective agonist. Thus, dopamine D-2 and/or D-3 receptor agonists elicit emesis, while dopamine D-1/D-5 or D-4 receptor-selective agonists are devoid of emetic properties. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.-All rights reserved.
