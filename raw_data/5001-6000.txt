H-1 and C-13 NMR data (APT, COSY, HMQC, and HMBC) revealed that the reaction was regioselective, as 3-O-ethoxycarboxymethylcoumestrol was the only monosubstituted derivative. The hapten was then conjugated to bovine serum albumin and used for immunization of rabbits. A radioimmunoassay (RIA) system was established based on the polyclonal antiserum and a I-125-labeled hapten-tyrosine methyl ester conjugate as the radioligand. Parameters of the RIA: sensitivity: 12 pg per tube, 50% intercept: 140 pg per tube, working range: 20-4000 pg per tube. The cross-reactivity of a panel isoflavonoid and lignan phytoestrogens was either negligible (e.g. formononetin 0.07%; biochanin A 0.06%) or not detectable at all. The major immunoreactive peak in HPLC fractions from an alfalfa extract had the same retention time as coumestrol standard and represented 94.8% of the signal. The remaining 5.2% of immunoreactivity was distributed between five minor peaks. We conclude that after the validation for particular matrices, the method will be a useful tool for analysis of coumestrol, especially in low volume and low concentration samples.

Patients: Patients (n = 24) meeting the diagnostic criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, for schizophrenia were selected from an outpatient clinic (age range 18-70 yr). Methods: Patients were given loxapine (dose determined by a physician) for a period of 12 weeks. There were clinic visits at before treatment began and at 6 weeks and 12 weeks of treatment. Scores on a variety of efficacy and safety scales were recorded at each visit, and blood was drawn for receptor assays. Results: Patients showed significant improvement on most psychiatric assessment scales after 6 and 12 weeks of treatment with loxapine, and both lymphocyte D-2-like and 5-HT2A platelet receptor binding were down-regulated after 6 and 12 weeks. The degree of receptor down-regulation was not significantly correlated with improvements in psychotic symptoms, however. Conclusion: Loxapine down-regulated both lymphocyte D-2-like and platelet 5-HT2A receptors to the same extent, suggesting that both receptors are involved in the mechanism of action of loxapine in patients with schizophrenia.

J	Lansdell, SJ; Millar, NS				Lansdell, SJ; Millar, NS			Dβ3, an atypical nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit from <i>Drosophila</i>:: molecular cloning, heterologous expression and coassembly	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						assembly; cDNA cloning; Drosophila; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor	APHID MYZUS-PERSICAE; ALPHA-SUBUNITS; CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; PHARMACOLOGICAL-PROPERTIES; GABA RECEPTOR; HAIR-CELLS; MELANOGASTER; SEQUENCE; IDENTIFICATION; BUNGAROTOXIN	Insect nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play a central role in mediating neuronal synaptic transmission and are the target sites for the increasingly important group of neonicotinoid insecticides. Six nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits (four alpha-type and two beta-type) have been cloned previously from the model insect species Drosophila melanogaster. Despite extensive efforts, it has not been possible to generate functional recombinant nAChRs by heterologous expression of any combination of these six subunits. It has, however, been possible to express functional hybrid receptors when Drosophila alphasubunits are co-expressed with vertebrate betasubunits. This has led to the assumption that successful heterologous expression might require an, as yet, uncloned beta-type insect subunit. Examination of the recently completed Drosophila genomic sequence data has identified a novel putative nAChR beta-type subunit. Here we report the molecular cloning, heterologous expression and characterization of this putative Drosophila nAChR subunit (Dbeta3). Phylogenetic comparisons with other ligand-gated ion channel subunit sequences support its classification as a nAChR subunit but show it to be a distantly related member of this neurotransmitter receptor subunit family. Evidence that the Dbeta3 subunit is able to coassemble with other Drosophila nAChR subunits and contribute to recombinant nAChRs has been obtained by both radioligand binding and coimmunoprecipitation studies in transfected Drosophila S2 cells.

However, there is a lack of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR specific PET radioligands with kinetics fast enough to enable quantification of nAChR within a reasonable time frame. Following on from promising preclinical results, the aim of the present study was to evaluate for the first time in humans the novel PET radioligand (-)-[F-18]Flubatine, formerly known as (-)-[F-18]NCFHEB, as a tool for alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR imaging and in vivo quantification.' Dynamic PET emission recordings lasting 270 min were acquired on an ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner in 12 healthy male non-smoking subjects (71.0 +/- 5.0 years) following the intravenous injection of 353.7 +/- 9.4 MBq of (-)-[F-18]Flubatine. Individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for coregistration. PET frames were motion-corrected, before the kinetics in 29 brain regions were characterized using 1- and 2-tissue compartment models (1TCM, 2TCM). Given the low amounts of metabolite present in plasma, we tested arterial input functions with and without metabolite corrections. In addition, pixel-based graphical analysis (Logan plot) was used. The model's goodness of fit, with and without metabolite correction was assessed by Akaike's information criterion. Model parameters of interest were the total distribution volume V-T (mL/cm(3)), and the binding potential BPND relative to the corpus callosum, which served as a reference region. The tracer proved to have high stability in vivo, with 90% of the plasma radioactivity remaining as untransformed parent compound at 90 min, fast brain kinetics with rapid uptake and equilibration between free and receptor-bound tracer. Adequate fits of brain TACs were obtained with the 1TCM. V-T could be reliably estimated within 90 min for all regions investigated, and within 30 min for low-binding regions such as the cerebral cortex. The rank order of V-T by region corresponded well with the known distribution of alpha 4 beta 2* receptors (V-T [thalamus] 27.4 +/- 3.8, V-T [putamen] 12.7 +/- 0.9, V-T [frontal cortex] 10.+/- 0.8, and V-T [corpus callosum]6.3 +/- 0.8). The BPND, which is a parameter of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR availability, was 3.41 +/- 0.79 for the thalamus, 1.04 +/- 0.25 for the putamen and 0.61 +/- 0.23 for the frontal cortex, indicating high specific tracer binding. Use of the arterial input function without metabolite correction resulted in a 10% underestimation in V-T, and was without important biasing effects on BPND. Altogether, kinetics and imaging properties of (-)-[F-18] Flubatine appear favorable and suggest that (-)[F-18] Flubatine is a very suitable and clinically applicable PET tracer for in vivo imaging of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Methods Ten healthy participants (30 years; 6M, 4F) and one participant with narcolepsy received a baseline positron emission tomography scan of [C-11]raclopride, a D2/3 dopamine receptor radioligand sensitive to dopamine occupancy, followed approximately one week later by an oral sedative 3g dose of SO and two [C-11]raclopride scans (1 h, 7 h post SO). Plasma SO levels and drowsiness duration were assessed. Results No significant changes were detected in [C-11]raclopride binding in striatum overall 1 or 7 h after SO, but a small non-significant increase in [C-11]raclopride binding, implying decreased dopamine occupancy, was noted in limbic striatal subdivision at one hour (+6.5%; p uncorrected = 0.045; +13.2%, narcolepsy participant), returning to baseline at 7 h. A positive correlation was observed between drowsiness duration and percent change in [C-11]raclopride binding in limbic striatum (r = 0.73; p = 0.017). Conclusions We did not find evidence in this sample of human subjects of a robust striatal dopamine change, as was reported in non-human primates. Our preliminary data, requiring extension, suggest that a 3g sedative SO dose might cause slight transient inhibition of dopamine release in limbic striatum.

Following the putative detection of 5F-CUMYL-P7AICA in Australia in 2016, the scaffold-hopping SCRAs 5F-CUMYL-PICA, 5F-CUMYL-PINACA, and 5F-CUMYL-P7AICA were synthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-MS (LC-QTOF-MS). Since little is known of the pharmacology of 7-azaindole SCRAs like 5F-CUMYL-P7AICA, the binding affinities and functional activities of all compounds at cannabinoid type 1 and type 2 receptors (CB1 and CB2, respectively) were assessed using tritiated radioligand competition experiments and fluorescence-based plate reader membrane potential assays. Despite CB1 binding affinities differing by over two orders of magnitude (K-i = 2.95-174 nM), all compounds were potent and efficacious CB1 agonists (EC50 = 0.43-4.7 nM), with consistent rank order for binding and functional activity (5F-CUMYL-PINACA >5F-CUMYL-PICA >5F-CUMYL-P7AICA). Additionally, 5F-CUMYL-P7AICA was found to exert potent cannabimimetic effects in mice, inducing hypothermia (6 degrees C, 3 mg/kg) through a CB1-dependent mechanism.

Imaging of Nonprostate Cancers Using PSMA-Targeted Radiotracers: Rationale, Current State of the Field, and a Call to Arms	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PSMA; PET; breast cancer; lung cancer; renal cell carcinoma	RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; F-18-DCFPYL PET/CT; GA-68-PSMA PET/CT; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; DIAGNOSTIC-ACCURACY; COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY	Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly overexpressed on prostate cancer epithelial cells and for which there is a growing body of literature examining the role of small-molecule and antibody radiotracers targeted against this protein for prostate cancer detection and therapy. Despite its name, PSMA is also expressed, to varying degrees, in the neovasculature of a wide variety of nonprostate cancers; indeed, the pathology literature is replete with promising immunohistochemistry findings. Several groups have begun to correlate those pathology-level results with in vivo imaging and therapy in nonprostate cancers using the same PSMA-targeted agents that have been so successful in prostate cancer. The potential to leverage radiotracers targeted to PSMA beyond prostate cancer is a promising approach for many cancers, and PSMA-targeted agents may be able to supplement or fill gaps left by other agents. However, to date, most of the reported findings with PSMA-targeted radiotracers in nonprostate malignancies have been in case reports and small case series, and the field must adopt a more thorough approach to the design and execution of larger prospective trials to realize the potential of these promising agents outside prostate cancer.

Why Targeting PSMA Is a Game Changer in the Management of Prostate Cancer	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PSMA; prostate cancer; urology	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; LU-177-PSMA-617 RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY J591; PHASE-I TRIAL; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; F-18-DCFBC PET/CT; BIODISTRIBUTION; LIGAND; RECURRENCE	Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is highly expressed on prostate adenocarcinomas, exhibits only limited expression in benign and extraprostatic tissues, and thus represents an ideal target for the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Since its discovery over 30 y ago, significant effort has been made to develop clinical technology targeting PSMA. The last 5 y have seen an explosion of development of new agents targeting PSMA for diagnostic and therapeutic use. Imaging agents targeting PSMA have been developed for SPECT and PET platforms. PSMA PET imaging appears to outperform traditional imaging in the high-risk localized-disease state, in patients with biochemical recurrence after treatment, and in advanced disease. To date, most of the reported clinical studies of therapeutic agents have used PSMA-targeted radiometals to deliver beta-radiation to metastatic disease sites, with 177Lu being the most widely investigated therapeutic radioisotope. Studies of both antibodies and small-molecule agents have been published and have demonstrated encouraging results. Safety appears generally limited to mild transient bone marrow toxicity and xerostomia because of uptake of the small-molecule agents in the salivary glands. Radiologic responses can be dramatic, and decreases in pain have been observed. The effect on overall survival, however, has yet to be demonstrated.

A library of 69 derivatives was prepared and evaluated in radioligand binding studies at adenosine receptor (AR) subtypes and for their ability to inhibit monoamine oxidases (MAO). Potent dual-target-directed A(1)/A(2A) adenosine receptor antagonists were identified. Several compounds showed triple-target inhibition; one of the best compounds was 8-(2,4-dichloro-5-fluorobenzyl)-1,3-dimethyl-6,7,8,9-tetra-hydropyrazino[2,1-f] purine-2,4(1H,3H)-dione (72) (human AR: K-i A(1) 217 nm, A(2A) 233 nm; IC50 MAO-B: 508 nm). Dichlorinated compound 36 [8-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)-1,3-dimethyl-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrazino[2,1-f] purine-2,4(1H, 3H)-dione] was found to be the best triple-target drug in rat (K-i A1 351 nm, A(2A) 322 nm; IC50 MAO-B: 260 nm), and may serve as a useful tool for preclinical proof-of-principle studies. Compounds that act at multiple targets relevant for symptomatic as well as disease-modifying treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are expected to show advantages over single-target therapeutics.

Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic saturation experiments in the same animals. Overall brain uptake of [F-18]altanserin was reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well with in vitro autoradiographic data of the same animals. [F-18]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and reference tissue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.

In man, [18F]AV-45 with positron emission tomography (PET) is currently studied and used to track in vivo amyloid accumulation. Here, [18F]-AV45-PET was used to visualize amyloid deposition in a transgenic murine model of amyloidosis (APP/PS1-21). Studies were performed ex vivo by autoradiography and in vivo by microPET. Autoradiograms of the brain sections highlighted an increased uptake of [18F]AV-45 in APP/PS1-21 mice compared with age-matched control mice. From 8 months, an intense labeling was observed in cortex, hippocampus, and striatum. The marked accumulation of radiotracer was found in close association with thioflavin S-positive amyloid plaques. The longitudinal microPET assessment, performed from 3 to 12 months of age, demonstrated an increased [18F]AV-45 uptake in APP/PS1-21 compared with control mice. The elevated tracer uptake was increased in association with age. This study opens the possibility of [18F]AV-45, coupled with microPET, to visualize and quantitatively measure amyloid deposits in the brains of living APP/PS1 mice. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

A novel [S-35]GTP gamma S binding/immunocapture assay was employed to evaluated changes in M-1 receptor function in cortical tissue samples harvested from people who had no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD. M-1 function was stable across clinical groups. However,[H-3]-oxotremorine-M radioligand binding studies revealed that the concentration of M-1 cortical receptors increased significantly between the NCI and AD groups. Although M-1 receptor function did not correlate with cognitive function based upon mini-mental status examination (MMSE) or global cognitive score (GCS), functional activity was negatively correlated with the severity of neuropathology determined by Braak staging and NIA-Reagan criteria for AD. Since M-1 agonists have the potential to modify the pathologic hallmarks of AD, as well as deficits in cognitive function in animal models of this disease, the present findings provide additional support for targeting the M, receptor as a potential therapeutic for AD.

Serotonin analogs that feature a fluorescent probe attached through an ether linkage at the tryptamine 5-position have high affinity for the 5-HT2C receptor, and affinity is dependent on both linker length and pendent dye. these variables have been optimized to generate Cy3B derivative 5a, which has 10-fold higher 5-HT2C affinity relative to serotonin (K-d = 0.23 nM). In receptor activation experiments, 5a acts as a full agonist of 5-HT2C. upon binding to 5-HT2C cell membranes, 5a shows a robust increase in fluorescence polarization (fp) signal. In an fp binding assay using 5a as a tracer ligand, K-i values for known 5-HT2C agonists and antagonists showed excellent agreement with K-i values from radio-ligand binding (r(2) = 0.93). the fp ligand assay is suitable for high-throughput drug screening applications with respect to speed of analysis, displaceable signal, precision, and sensitivity to various reagents. A 384-well-based high-throughput assay that is rapid, economical, and predictive of test compounds' ability to bind to the 5-HT2C receptor has been compiled and validated.

In competitive binding experiments, CART(61-102), CART(55-102) and di-iodinated CART(61-102) were bound to PC 12 cell membranes with K-i in low nM range; their affinity to intact non-differentiated and differentiated cells was in low 10(-8) M range. In order to prove that iodination did not eliminate the pharmacological properties of CART, we tested the biological activity of di-iodinated CART(61-102). It decreased food intake in in vivo feeding experiment on fasted mice in a dose of 1 mu g/mouse to the same extent as CART(61-102) in a dose of 0.5 mu g/mouse. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Following transfection into HEK293 cells, 6- to 13-fold increases in the density of specific [I-125]BE 2254 binding sites were observed for both tagged and untagged Delta(1-79) alpha(1D)- compared to full-length alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, while agonist and antagonist affinities remained unchanged. In contrast, inummoprecipitation of tagged receptors showed that full-length alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor protein was at least twice as abundant as Delta(1-79) alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor protein. Photoaffinity labelling with [I-125]arylazidoprazosin showed much more intense labelling of tagged Delta(1-79) alpha(1D)- than of full-length alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors. Substantial N-linked glycosylation of tagged Delta (1 -79) alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors was observed, although full-length alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors contain two consensus glycosylation sites but,are not glycosylated. These results suggest that N-terminal truncation of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors enhances processing of a binding competent form in HEK293 cells; and show a clear dissociation between abundance of receptor protein and density of receptor binding sites.

In an attempt to expand the therapeutic potential of this class, four new omega -conotoxins (CVIA-D) have been discovered in the venom of the piscivorous cone snail, Conus catus, using assay-guided fractionation and gene cloning. Compared with other omega -conotoxins, CVID has a novel loop 4 sequence and the highest selectivity for N-type over P/Q-type calcium channels in radioligand binding assays. CVIA-D also inhibited contractions of electrically stimulated rat vas deferens. In electrophysiological studies, omega -conotoxins CVID and MVIIA had similar potencies to inhibit current through central (alpha (1B-d)) and peripheral (alpha (1B-b)) splice variants of the rat N-type calcium channels when coexpressed with rat beta (3) in Xenopus oocytes, However, the potency of CVID and MVIIA increased when alpha (1B-d) and alpha (1B-b) were expressed in the absence of rat beta (3), an effect most pronounced for CVID at alpha (1B-d) (up to 540-fold) and least pronounced for MVIIA at alpha (1B-d) (3-fold). The novel selectivity of CVID may have therapeutic implications. H-1 NMR studies reveal that CMD possesses a combination of unique structural features, including two hydrogen bonds that stabilize loop 2 and place loop 2 proximal to loop 4, creating a globular surface that is rigid and well defined.

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of chronically elevated ET-1 concentrations in vitro on the expression of the beta -adrenergic receptor (beta AR), the ol-subunit of the stimulatory guanine-nucleotide-binding protein (G(s alpha)). and to determine beta AR's ability to activate adenylyl cyclase. In order to elucidate the effects of elevated ET-1 concentrations in vivo, male rats were infused with ET-1 and beta AR density was measured. Smooth muscle cells were incubated with ET-1 (10(-7) mol/l) for 6 to 48 h. Densities of beta ARs were determined by radioligand binding studies and the G(s alpha) was analyzed by Western blotting. Isoproterenol-mediared adenylyl cyclase activity was measured. Additionally male rats were infused with ET-1 for 3 weeks. In vitro the beta AR density increased by 52% (p < 0.05, n = 5). The G(s<alpha>) increased to 260%. The isoproterenol-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was increased to 228%. In vivo, the pulmonary and myocardial beta AR density was elevated by 43% and 97%, respec tively. Chronic ET receptor activation induces a transregulation of beta ARs in vitro and in vivo.

Methods: plant samples were macerated in 40% ethanol or hot/ cold glycerate and assessed for polyphenols content. The antioxidant activity was investigated by DPPH radical scavenging assay and H(2)DCFDA test in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and N9 microglial cells. MTS experiments and antiinflammatory properties verified cellular toxicity through NO assay. Interaction with A(2A) adenosine receptors was evaluated through binding assays using [H-3]ZM241385 radioligand. Results: Polyphenols were present in 40% ethanol plant extract, which at 0.1-10 mu g/mu L achieved good antioxidant effects, with a DPPH radical scavenging rate of about 90%. In LPS-stimulated cells, these plant extracts, at 1 mu g/mu L, did not affect cell vitality, displayed significant inhibition of H(2)DCFDA and NO production, and inhibited ZM 241385 binding in CHO cells transfected with A(2A) receptors. RAW 264.7 and N9 cells presented a density of them quantified in 60 & PLUSMN; 9 and 45 & PLUSMN; 5 fmol/mg of protein, respectively. Conclusion: Epilobium parviflorum, Cardiospermum halicacabum, and Melilotus officinalis extracts may be considered a source of agents for treating disorders related to oxidative stress and inflammation.

In this study, we developed an experimental model to assess the trophic transfer of CTXs from herbivorous parrotfish, Chlorurus microrhinos, to carnivorous lionfish, Pterois volitans. During a 6-week period, juvenile lionfish were fed naturally contaminated parrotfish fillets at a daily dose of 0.11 or 0.035 ng CTX3C equiv. g(-1), as measured by the radioligand-receptor binding assay (r-RBA) or neuroblastoma cell-based assay (CBA-N2a), respectively. During an additional 6-week depuration period, the remaining fish were fed a CTX-free diet. Using r-RBA, no CTXs were detectable in muscular tissues, whereas CTXs were measured in the livers of two out of nine fish sampled during exposure, and in four out of eight fish sampled during depuration. Timepoint pooled liver samples, as analyzed by CBA-N2a, confirmed the accumulation of CTXs in liver tissues, reaching 0.89 ng CTX3C equiv. g(-1) after 41 days of exposure, followed by slow toxin elimination, with 0.37 ng CTX3C equiv. g(-1) measured after the 6-week depuration. These preliminary results, which need to be pursued in adult lionfish, strengthen our knowledge on CTX transfer and kinetics along the food web.

The different subtypes of ARs and the knowledge on their densities and status are important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of diseases and for developing new therapeutics. Looking for new scaffolds for selective AR ligands, coumarin-chalcone hybrids were synthesized (compounds 1-8) and screened in radioligand binding (hA(1), hA(2A) and hA(3)) and adenylyl cyclase (hA(2B)) assays in order to evaluate their affinity for the four human AR subtypes (hARs). Coumarin-chalcone hybrid has been established as a new scaffold suitable for the development of potent and selective ligands for hA(1) or hA(3) subtypes. In general, hydroxy-substituted hybrids showed some affinity for the hA(1), while the methoxy counterparts were selective for the hA(3). The most potent hA(1) ligand was compound 7 (K-i = 17.7 mu M), whereas compound 4 was the most potent ligand for hA(3) (K-i = 2.49 mu M). In addition, docking studies with hA(1) and hA(3) homology models were established to analyze the structure-function relationships. Results showed that the different residues located on the protein binding pocket could play an important role in ligand selectivity.

In Pursuit of Fluorinated Sigma Receptor Ligand Candidates Related to [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-FPS	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article							C-H FLUORINATION; PPBP 4-PHENYL-1-(4-PHENYLBUTYL) PIPERIDINE; TRANSIENT FOCAL ISCHEMIA; DECREASES BRAIN-INJURY; ALKYL FLUORIDES; GENERAL-METHOD; RADIOLIGAND; ALCOHOLS; BINDING; MODEL	This paper describes the synthesis of N-arylmethyl(1-benzyl) and N-aroyl(1-benzoyl) 4-(4-fluoromethylphenoxymethyl)piperidines as potential sigma receptor ligands analogous to the potent and highly selective sigma-1 ligand [F-18]-FPS, but with enhanced or alternative binding and transport profiles. The synthesis involves N-aroylation of 4-hydroxmethylpiperidine or ethyl nipecotate, functional group manipulation of the ester group or simple activation of the hydroxyl group to introduce the phenoxy component, and subsequent functional group manipulation to reduce the amide group and introduce the fluorine into the fluoromethyl substituent. In its development, the synthesis was found to require early N-aroylation of the piperidine precursor to avoid complications due to anchimeric assistance by its nitrogen in subsequent displacement reactions. New evidence is presented on the pathway followed in a literature report of direct displacement of a benzylic hydroxyl group by fluoride ion under Appel-like conditions. Relevant to the literature report, the halide ion in the fluoromethylphenoxy 1-benzylpiperidine derivatives was surprisingly labile to hydrolytic displacement on chromatography and this aspect is worthy of further study. Moreover, the NMR spectra of the amides were complicated by geometric isomerism about the amide C(O)-N bond, but detailed analysis of spectra from 2-anisoyl derivatives allowed the assignment of diastereomeric contributors to consistent, secondary atropisomerism about the aryl-C(O) bond.

For compounds binding at the benzodiazepine site of the receptor, the first step is to set up a primary screen that consists of developing radioligand binding assays on cell membranes expressing the major GABA(A) subtypes. Then, taking advantage of the heterologous expression of rodent and human GABA(A) receptors in Xenopus oocytes or HEK 293 cells, it is possible to explore, in electrophysiological assays, the physiological properties of the different receptor subtypes and the pharmacological properties of the identified compounds. The Xenopus oocyte system will be presented here, starting with the isolation of the oocytes and their microinjection with different mRNAs, up to the pharmacological characterization using two-electrode voltage clamps. Finally, recordings conducted in rodent brain slices will be described that are used as a secondary physiological test to assess the activity of molecules at their native receptors in a well-defined neuronal circuit. Extracellular recordings using population responses of multiple neurons are demonstrated together with the drug application.

Other aspects of obesity may be more tightly coupled to the dopaminergic system. We characterized obesity-associated behaviors and determined if these related to central D2 receptor (D2R) specific binding independent of BMI. Twenty-two obese and 17 normal-weight participants completed eating-and reward-related questionnaires and underwent PET scans using the D2R-selective and nondisplaceable radioligand (N-[C-11]methyl) benperidol. Questionnaires were grouped by domain (eating related to emotion, eating related to reward, non-eating behavior motivated by reward or sensitivity to punishment). Normalized, summed scores for each domain were compared between obese and normal-weight groups and correlated with striatal and midbrain D2R binding. Compared to normal-weight individuals, the obese group self-reported higher rates of eating related to both emotion and reward (p < 0.001), greater sensitivity to punishment (p = 0.06), and lower non-food reward behavior (p < 0.01). Across normal-weight and obese participants, self-reported emotional eating and non-food reward behavior positively correlated with striatal (p < 0.05) and midbrain (p < 0.05) D2R binding, respectively. In conclusion, an emotional eating phenotype may reflect altered central D2R function better than other commonly used obesity-related measures such as BMI.

It has been hypothesized that this phenomenon, named "Scans Without Evidence of Dopaminergic Deficiency" (SWEDD), may be an adult-onset dystonia. We investigated the hypothesis that these patients might be affected by Dopa-Responsive Dystonia (DRD). We enrolled eleven unrelated patients (8 F and 3 M) with clinical parkinsonism and normal [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT. The GTP-cyclohydrolase1 (GCH1) gene was sequenced in all patients; urine biopterin and neopterin analysis was carried out in nine and oral phenylalanine (Phe) loading in seven. Neurological examination showed bradykinesia and resting/postural tremor in all patients, and rigidity in ten, suggesting a clinical diagnosis of PD. We detected mild dystonic signs in eight cases. In particular, five of them presented cranial dyskinesias. No mutation of the GCH1 gene was found. The results of the urine biopterin and neopterin analysis and the oral Phe loading did not reveal biochemical abnormalities suggestive of reduced GCH1 activity. We confirm that some clinical features, namely the presence of focal or segmental dystonia, suggest an adult-onset dystonia in SWEDD cases. However, we exclude DRD caused by GCH1 gene mutations in the present series.

However, the neurochemical underpinnings of normal speech production remain largely unknown. We investigated the extent of striatal endogenous dopamine release and its influences on the organization of functional striatal speech networks during production of meaningful English sentences using a combination of positron emission tomography (PET) with the dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor radioligand [C-11]raclopride and functional MRI (fMRI). In addition, we used diffusion tensor tractography (DTI) to examine the extent of dopaminergic modulatory influences on striatal structural network organization. We found that, during sentence production, endogenous dopamine was released in the ventromedial portion of the dorsal striatum, in both its associative and sensorimotor functional divisions. In the associative striatum, speech-induced dopamine release established a significant relationship with neural activity and influenced the left-hemispheric lateralization of striatal functional networks. In contrast, there were no significant effects of endogenous dopamine release on the lateralization of striatal structural networks. Our data provide the first evidence for endogenous dopamine release in the dorsal striatum during normal speaking and point to the possible mechanisms behind the modulatory influences of dopamine on the organization of functional brain circuits controlling normal human speech.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scans with ligands for this receptor show increased expression of TSPO in many neuropathologic conditions. However, expression of TSPO in the periphery and its possible correlation to central nervous system (CNS) inflammation has been largely unstudied. In this paper PBR28, a recently synthesized ligand for TSPO that is shown to have 80-fold higher specific binding than its predecessor PK11195, is used to quantify peripheral TSPO. Data presented in this study show that monocytes account for the majority of TSPO measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and that TSPO expression is stable over time in healthy individuals. Previous studies show that areas of increased PBR28 binding in the brains of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients correlate with active demylinating lesions found during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To measure peripheral TSPO expression in an inflammatory disease of the CNS, PBR28 is used in an in vitro radioligand binding assay to measure the amount of TSPO in the PBMC of MS and healthy donor cohorts. Surprisingly, MS patients are found to have a significantly lower amount of peripheral TSPO than healthy donors. We suggest that TSPO protein expression is a potential peripheral biomarker of MS, more research is needed to determine if peripheral TSPO expression may also be altered in other neuroinflammatory conditions.

The cyclization takes place with (N--5) neighboring group participation. The reaction of 3 beta-acetoxy-21-azidopregn-5-en-20 beta-ol (3d) with triphenylphosphine gave 3 beta-acetoxy-21-phosphiniminopregn-5-en-20 beta-ol, which reacted in situ with carbon dioxide with the participation of the sterically favored 20 beta-OH to give the unsubstituted steroidal cyclic carbamate (8). Oppenauer oxidation of the 3 beta-hydroxy-exo-heterocyclic steroids (5a-f, 9) yielded the corresponding Delta(4)-3-ketosteroids (7a-f, 10). The inhibitory effects (IC50) of these compounds on rat testicular C-17,C-20-lyase were investigated with an in vitro radioligand incubation technique. The N-unsubstituted 17 beta-(2-oxazolidon-5-yl)-androst-4-en-3-one derivative (10) was found to be a potent inhibitor (IC50 = 3.0 mu M). (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Lamarckian genetic algorithm (AutoDock 3.0) was used to model the interaction/binding between m-iodo-p-methoxyHoechst (IMH), a ligand available in the Protein Data Bank whose binding to the minor groove of DNA has been demonstrated (crystal structure), and the oligonucleotide d(CGCGAATTCGCG)(2). Since the predicted complex compared well with the crystal structure, m-iodo-p-ethoxyHoechst (IEH), a radioligand we had previously synthesized and characterized, was then docked onto DNA, the IEH-DNA complex minimized, and the binding free energy and inhibition constant (K-i) estimated and compared with those for IMH-DNA. Using the protocol, several novel iodoHoechst analogs were designed. Finally, Insight 11 was used to measure the distances between the iodine atom of these Hoechst analogs and the central axis of the targeted DNA, and these values were correlated with the expected (Monte Carlo calculations) and measured (experimental data) double-strand-break yield following 125 1 decay. The approach is general and can be applied to the interaction of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals with DNA and other macromolecular targets. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this strategy, the strong electrophilic [TcN(PNP)](2+) metal fragment efficiently reacts with bifunctional chelating ligands having a pi-donor atom set, such as N-functionalized O,S-cysteine. The 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine (2-MPP) pharmacophore, which displays preferential affinity for 5HT(1A) receptors, was conjugated to the amino group of cysteine to obtain 2-MPPP-cys-OS, where 2-MPPP is 3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]propionate. The asymmetric Tc(V)-nitrido complexes, [Tc-99g/99m(N)(PNP)(2-MPPP-cys-OS)] (PNP = PNP3, PNP4), were obtained in high yield (95%), by simultaneous addition of PNP and 2-MPPP-cys-OS ligand to a solution containing a starting Tc-99g/99m-nitrido precursor. A mixture of syn and anti isomers was observed, the latter being the thermodynamically favored species. In vitro challenge experiments using the anti isomers with glutathione and cysteine indicated that no transchelation reaction occurs. Assessment of the in vitro 5HT(1A) receptor-affinity of the technetium complexes revealed that only the anti-PNP4 complex possesses some affinity for the receptor, but displayed negligible brain uptake in biodistribution studies in rats in vivo.

The pacemaker site is known to shift away from the sinoatrial (SA) node in response to autonomic stimuli. 2. To test whether the shifting of the impulse-initiation site that occurs during autonomic nerve stimulation can be explained by the spatial distributions of beta -adrenoceptor and muscarinic receptors, we obtained densities (B-max ) and dissociation constants (K-d ) for these receptors in three regions along the sulcus terminalis (the SA node itself and regions superior and inferior to it) and a region of the right atrial appendage in the dog. 3. The B-max values for [(125) I]-iodocyanopindolol binding to beta -adrenoceptors were not different among the four regions. The B-max value for [(3) H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic receptors was significantly higher in the SA node area than in any other region (P < 0.01), although there was no difference among the other three regions. 4. For each receptor, K-d values were similar among the four regions. 5. These results suggest that spatial variations in the densities of beta -adrenoceptors and muscarinic receptors are not important for shifting the impulse-initiation site and that other factors, such as non-uniform innervation by autonomic nerve fibres, may be mainly responsible for the pacemaker shift induced by autonomic nerve stimulation.

The in vitro binding studies using rat brain slices demonstrated that (+/-)[C-11]1 shows an extremely hi.-h-specific binding to the NR2B subunit of NMDA receptors. In contrast to the in vitro binding. the in vivo binding to mouse and monkey brains showed no apparent specific localization of the radioactivity in any of the brain regions. Metabolism and physicochemical properties such as the lipophilicity of (+/-)[C-11]1 seemed unlikely to affect the in vivo (+/-)[C-11]1 binding. Among the various endogenous ligands acting at the NMDA receptors, polyamines (spermine and spermidine) and divalent cations (Mg2+ Zn2+ and Ca2+) strongly inhibited the in vitro(+/-)[C-11]1 binding. Thus. the present studies point to the possibility, that the polyamines and cations behave as endogenous inhibitors for (+/-)[C-11]1 binding, leading to the loss of the specific binding in vivo, (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

To determine whether these changes were due to decreases in the level of protein kinase C, we measured [H-3]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding, levels of the protein kinase C isoforms alpha, beta, delta, epsilon, gamma, eta and theta, as well as protein kinase C activity in crude particulate membranes from parahippocampal gyri of 15 schizophrenic and 15 control subjects. There was a significant decrease in the density (mean +/- SEM: 6.56 +/- 0.73 pmol mg(-1) vs 9.68 +/- 1.22 pmol mg(-1); P < 0.05) and affinity (mean K-D +/- SEM: 4.64 +/- 0.34 nM vs 2.95 +/- 0.35 nM; P < 0.005) of [H-3]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding in homogenates from schizophrenic subjects. There were no significant changes in levels of the protein kinase C isoforms which are known to bind phorbol esters or in the activity of protein kinase C in membranes from schizophrenic subjects. These results suggest that there are changes in molecules capable of binding [H-3]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate, other than protein kinase C, in the parahippocampal gyrus from subjects with schizophrenia.

To date, the status of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in AD in relation to accompanying behavioral disturbances is unknown. This study aimed to measure alterations of muscarinic M-1 and M-2 receptor binding in the frontal and temporal cortex of AD and to correlate the neurochemical findings with clinical features. Methods: The cognitive and behavioral features of 26 patients with AD were assessed prospectively using standardized tests. Together with 14 matched controls, the status of muscarinic M-1 and M-2 receptors in the postmortem frontal and temporal cortex of these patients were measured by radioligand binding assays and were correlated with clinical data. Results: Compared with controls, M-2 receptor density was reduced only in the frontal cortex of AD, whereas M-1 was unaffected, Within the AD group, the neurochemical variables were not affected by demographic factors, disease severity, or cognition. Instead, M-2 receptor density was increased in the frontal and temporal cortex of patients with AD with psychotic symptoms compared with those without these symptoms. Conclusions: This study suggests a role for M-2 receptors in the psychosis of AD and may provide the rationale for treatment of behaviorally perturbed patients with AD with cholinomimetics and M-2 antagonists.

This receptor, termed AXOR35, is most closely related to the H3 histamine receptor, sharing 37% protein sequence identity. A multiple responsive element/cyclic AMP-responsive element-luciferase reporter assay was used to identify histamine as a ligand for AXOR35. When transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells, the AXOR35 receptor showed a strong, dose-dependent calcium mobilization response to histamine and H3 receptor agonists including imetit and immepip. Radioligand binding confirmed that the AXOR35 receptor was a high-affinity histamine receptor. The pharmacology of the AXOR35 receptor was found to closely resemble that of the H3 receptor; the major difference was that (R)-alpha -methylhistamine was a low potency agonist of the AXOR35 receptor. Thioperamide is an antagonist at AXOR 35. Expression of AXOR35 mRNA in human tissues is highest in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in tissues likely to contain high concentrations of blood cells, such as bone marrow and lung. In situ hybridization analysis of a wide survey of mouse tissues showed that mouse AXOR35 mRNA is selectively expressed in hippocampus. The identification and localization of this new histamine receptor will expand our understanding of the physiological and pathological roles of histamine and may provide additional opportunities for pharmacological modification of these actions.

J	Richelson, E; Souder, T				Richelson, E; Souder, T			Binding of antipsychotic drugs to human brain receptors - Focus on newer generation compounds	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						histamine H-1 receptor; muscarinic receptor; alpha(1)-adrenoceptor; alpha(2)-adrenoceptor; dopamine D-2 receptor; serotonin 5-HT1A receptor; serotonin 5-HT2A receptor	NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE D-1; CLOZAPINE; NEUROLEPTICS; ANTAGONISM; AFFINITY; SITES	Using radioligand binding assays and post-mortem normal human brain tissue, we obtained equilibrium dissociation constants (K(d)s) for nine new antipsychotic drugs (iloperidone, melperone, olanzapine, ORG 5222, quetiapine, risperidone, sertindole, ziprasidone, and zotepine), one metabolite of a new drug (9-OH-risperidone), and three older antipsychotics (clozapine, haloperidol, and pimozide) at nine different receptors (alpha (1)-adrenergic, alpha (2)-adrenergic, dopamine D-2, histamine H-1, muscarinic, and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C receptors). Iloperidone was the most potent drug at the two adrenergic receptors. ORG 5222 was the most potent drug at dopamine D-2 and 5-HT2c receptors, while ziprasidone was the most potent compound at three serotonergic receptors (5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, and 5-HT2A). At the remaining two receptors, olanzapine was the most potent drug at the histamine H-1 receptor (K-d=0.087 nM); clozapine at the muscarinic receptor (K-d=9 nM). Certain therapeutic and adverse effects, as well as certain drug interactions can be predicted from a drug's potency for blocking a specific receptor. These data can provide guidelines for the clinician in the choice of antipsychotic drug. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Pretargeted methodology could avoid the high radiation exposure due to the slow pharmacokinetics of antibodies. In this investigation, we reported the development of a novel pretargeted single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging strategy (atezolizumab-TCO/[99mTc]HYNIC-PEG11-Tz) for evaluating immune checkpoint ligand PD-L1 expression in tumor based on bioorthogonal Diels-Alder click chemistry. Procedures The radioligand [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz was achieved by the synthesis of a 6-hydrazinonicotinc acid (HYNIC) modified 1,2,4,5-tetrazine (Tz) and subsequently radiolabeled with technetium-99m (Tc-99m). The stability of [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz was evaluatedin vitro, and its blood pharmacokinetic test was performedin vivo. Atezolizumab was modified with trans-cyclooctene (TCO). The [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz and atezolizumab-TCO interaction was testedin vitro. Pretargeted H1975 cell immunoreactivity binding and saturation binding assays were evaluated. Pretargeted biodistribution and SPECT imaging experiments were performed in H1975 and A549 tumor-bearing modal mice to evaluate the PD-L1 expression level. Results [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz was successfully radiosynthesized with a specific activity of 9.25 MBq/mu g and a radiochemical purity above 95 % as confirmed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz showed favorable stability in NS, PBS, and FBS and rapid blood clearance in mice. The atezolizumab was modified with TCO-NHS ester to produce a conjugate with an average 6.4 TCO moieties as confirmed by liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer (LC-MS). Size exclusion HPLC revealed almost complete reaction between atezolizumab-TCO and [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tzin vitro, with the 1:1 Tz-to-mAb reaction providing a conversion yield of 88.65 +/- 1.22 %. Pretargeted cell immunoreactivity binding and saturation binding assays showed high affinity to H1975 cells. After allowing 48 h for accumulation of atezolizumab-TCO in H1975 tumor, pretargetedin vivobiodistribution revealed high uptake of the radiotracer in the tumor with a tumor-to-muscle ratio of 27.51 and tumor-to-blood ratio of 1.91. Pretargeted SPECT imaging delineated the H1975 tumor clearly. Pretargeted biodistribution and SPECT imaging in control groups demonstrated a significantly reduced tracer accumulation in the A549 tumor. Conclusions We have developed a HYNIC-modified Tz derivative, and the HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz was labeled with Tc-99m with a high specific activity and radiochemical purity. [Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz reacted rapidly and almost completely towards atezolizumab-TCOin vitrowith the 1:1 Tz-to-mAb reaction. SPECT imaging using the pretargeted strategy (atezolizumab-TCO/[Tc-99m]HYNIC-PEG(11)-Tz) demonstrated high-contrast images for high PD-L1 expression H1975 tumor and a low background accumulation of the probe. The pretargeted imaging strategy is a powerful tool for evaluating PD-L1 expression in xenograft mice tumor models and a potential candidate for translational clinical application.

A 2022 International Survey on the Status of Prostate Cancer Theranostics	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						prostate cancer; PSMA; Theranostics; PET; survey	PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; CONSENSUS; THERAPY; PET/CT; LIGAND	Growing interest in PSMA imaging using [Ga-68]- or [F-18]-labeled ligands and PSMA-based radioligand therapy (RLT) of prostate cancer (PCa) prompted us to survey the global community on their experiences and expectations. Methods: A web-based survey was composed to interrogate areas specific to PET imaging, the clinical value chain, and RLT applications. International responses were collected in early 2022. In total, over 300 valid responses were received and evaluated. Results: Most responses (83%) were given by nuclear medicine specialists with extensive experience in PET. At 22% of sites, PCa ranked "top" in cancer-type-specific PET indications, with an average and median of 15% and 10% of all cases, respectively. The most frequently used PSMA PET tracers were [Ga-68]PSMA (32%) and [F-18]PSMA-1007 (31%). Users reported a steady growth in PSMA PET and RLT over the past 5 y, averaging 50% and 82%, respectively, with a further 100% median growth projected over the next 5 y. Of note, more respondents indicated cognizance of personalized dosimetry than actually used it routinely. The most commonly identified barriers to future growth in PCa theranostics were radiopharmaceutical supply, reimbursement, staff availability, and buy-in of medical oncologists. Conclusion: Despite enthusiasm, this survey indicates variable adoption of PSMA imaging and RLT globally. Several challenges need to be addressed by the medical community, authorities, and patient advocacy groups in integrating PSMA-targeted theranostics into personalizedmedicine.

There is a different shelf life for each labeled product, which determines how long a product can maintain in vitro stability before it needs to be discarded. Lu-177 is a radioactive isotope that is increasingly being accepted into the treatment paradigm for palliation of advanced-stage tumors, including metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). In our institution, synthesis of Lu-177 with prostate-specific membrane antigen imaging and therapy (PSMA I&T) for palliation of mCRPC is performed on an automated synthesis system. Methods: After each synthesis, the final product quality was evaluated by highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC) at 3 different time points: 0, 24, and 48 h. Between February 2020 and October 2020, the quality of 35 batches of Lu-177-PSMA I&T was evaluated. Results: The average radiochemical purity of ITLC-silica gel was found to be greater than 99% (99.70% +/- 60.05%), and HPLC was greater than 98% (98.60% +/- 60.05%). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that synthesis of Lu-177-PSMA I&T with an automated synthesis system can remain stable for 48 h after labeling.

Herein, we present the design, synthesis, and evaluation of 11 PSMA-binding radioligands with modified linker structures, focusing on the relationship between molecular structure and targeting properties. The linker design was based on 2-naphthyl-L-alanine-tranexamic acid, the linker structure of PSMA-617. X-ray crystal-structure analysis of PSMA and structure-based design were used to generate the linker modifications, suggesting that substitution of tranexamic acid could lead to interactions with Phe546, Trp541, and Arg43 within the binding cavity. After synthesis through SPPS, analogues were labelled with indium-111 and evaluated in vitro for their specific binding, affinity, and cellular retention. Selected compounds were further evaluated in vivo in PSMA-expressing tumour-bearing mice. Based on the results, 2-naphthyl-L-alanine appears to be crucial for good targeting properties, whereas tranexamic acid could be replaced by other substituents. [In-111]In-BQ7859, consisting of a 2-naphthyl-L-alanine-L-tyrosine linker, demonstrated favourable targeting properties. The substitution of tranexamic acid for L-tyrosine in the linker led to an improved tumour-to-blood ratio, highlighting [In-111]In-BQ7859 as a promising PSMA-targeting radioligand.

Full-length 7-transmembrane (TM) variants of MOR share similar amino acid sequences of TM domains in rodents and humans; however, interspecies differences in N- and C-terminal amino acid sequences of MOR splice variants dramatically affect the downstream signaling. Thus, it is essential to develop a mouse model that expresses human MOR splice variants for opioid pharmacological studies. We generated 2 lines of fully humanized MOR mice (hMOR(+); mMOR(-/-) mice), line #1 and #2. The novel murine model having human OPRM1 genes and human-specific variants was examined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and the MinION nanopore sequencing. The differences in the regional distribution of MOR between wild-type and humanized MOR mice brains were detected by RNAscope and radioligand binding assay. hMOR(+); mMOR(-/-) mice were characterized in vivo using a tail-flick, charcoal meal, open field, tail suspension, naloxone precipitation tests, and rectal temperature measurement. The data indicated that wild-type and humanized MOR mice exhibited different pharmacology of morphine, including antinociception, tolerance, sedation, and withdrawal syndromes, suggesting the presence of species difference between mouse and human MORs. Therefore, hMOR(+); mMOR(-/-) mice could serve as a novel mouse model for pharmacogenetic studies of opioids.

Since there is no brain region devoid of TSPO, an arterial input function (AIF) is ideally required for quantification of binding. However, obtaining an AIF is experimentally demanding, is sometimes uncomfortable for participants, and can introduce additional measurement error during quantification. The objective of this study was to perform an evaluation of the test-retest reliability and convergent validity of techniques used for quantifying (R)-[C-11]PK11195 binding without an AIF in clinical studies.MethodsData from six healthy individuals who participated in two PET examinations, 6weeks apart, were analyzed. Regional non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) values were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model, with either cerebellum as reference region or a reference input derived using supervised cluster analysis (SVCA). Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were estimated for the time interval of 40-60min.ResultsTest-retest reliability for BPND estimates were poor (80% of ICCs <0.5). BPND estimates derived without an AIF were not correlated with BPND, total or specific distribution volume from the 2TCM using an AIF (all R-2<12%). SUVs showed moderate reliability but no correlation to any other outcome measure.ConclusionsCaution is warranted when interpreting patient-control comparisons employing (R)-[C-11]PK11195 outcome measures obtained without an AIF.

This study aimed to evaluate the potential of radioiodinated flavonoid derivatives for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of PrPSc. In vitro binding assays using recombinant mouse PrP (rMoPrP) aggregates revealed that the 4-dimethylamino-substituted styrylchromone derivative (SC-NMe2) had higher in vitro binding affinity (K-d = 24.5 nM) and capacity (B-max = 36.3 pmol/nmol protein) than three other flavonoid derivatives (flavone, chalcone, and aurone). Fluorescent imaging using brain sections from mouse-adapted bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mBSE)-infected mice demonstrated that SC-NMe2 clearly labelled PrPSc-positive prion deposits in the mice brain. Two methoxy SC derivatives, SC-OMe and SC(OMe)(2), also showed high binding affinity for rMoPrP aggregates with K-i values of 20.8 and 26.6 nM, respectively. In vitro fluorescence and autoradiography experiments demonstrated high accumulation of [(125I)]SC-OMe and [(125I)] SC-(OMe)(2) in prion deposit-rich regions of the mBSE-infected mouse brain. SPECT/computed tomography (CT) imaging and ex vivo autoradiography demonstrated that [(123I)]SC-OMe showed consistent brain distribution with the presence of PrPSc deposits in the mBSE-infected mice brain. In conclusion, [(123I)]SC-OMe appears a promising SPECT radioligand for monitoring prion deposit levels in the living brain.

PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Caudate nucleus; Dopamine supersensitivity; Psychosis; Putamen; Schizophrenia; Striatum	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NAIVE SCHIZOPHRENIC-PATIENTS; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; HIGH-AFFINITY-STATE; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; INTERACTING PROTEINS; D2-DOPAMINE RECEPTOR; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEGATIVE SYMPTOMS; BASAL GANGLIA	It is known that schizophrenia patients are behaviorally supersensitive to dopamine-like drugs (amphetamine, methylphenidate). There is evidence for an increased release of dopamine, a slight increase of dopamine D2 receptors and an increase of dopamine D2High receptors in schizophrenia, all possibly explaining the clinical supersensitivity to dopamine. The elevation in apparent D2High receptors in vivo in schizophrenia matches the elevation in D2High receptors in many animal models of psychosis. The increased amounts of D2High receptors in psychotic-like behavior in animals may result from a loss of control of D2 by various factors. These factors include the rate of phosphorylation and desensitization of D2 receptors by kinases, the attachment of arrestin to D2 receptors, internalization of D2 receptors, the rate of receptor de-phosphorylation, formation of D2 receptor dimers, and GTP regulation by various GTPases. While at present there are no statistically significant associations of any of these controlling factors and their genes with schizophrenia, investigation of D2High receptors in schizophrenia will require a new radioligand in order to selectively label D2High receptors in vivo in patients. Finally, haloperidol reduces the number of D2High receptors that are elevated by amphetamine, indicating that this therapeutic effect may occur clinically. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In control cells, the displacement curves for histamine against the binding of 5 nM [H-3]mepyramine, a radioligand for H-1-receptors, showed the presence of two binding sites for histamine, that is, high and low affinity sites. Pretreatment with 0.1 mM histamine for 30 min at 37 degrees C induced a significant reduction in the percentage of high affinity sites for histamine and a concomitant increase in the percentage of low affinity sites with no change in their pIC(50) values. These histamine-induced changes were insensitive to 30 mu M KN-62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, but they were completely inhibited either by 0.4 mM ZnCl2, an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), or under hypertonic conditions, where clathrin-mediated endocytosis is known to be inhibited. These results suggest that histamine-induced conversion of high to low affinity sites for histamine is predominantly regulated by GRK/clathrin-mediated internalization of H-1-receptors in human astrocytoma cells.

Yohimbine, an alpha 2 adrenoceptor antagonist, has recently been developed as a carbon-11 [11C]-labeled radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies. Here we explore the hypothesis that yohimbine can be used as an in vivo tracer of NA receptor binding and release during amphetamine challenges in Landrace pigs. Pigs underwent baseline PET scans with [11C]yohimbine and were then challenged with 10 mg/kg d-amphetamine 20 min prior to a second [11C]yohimbine scan. Using the Logan analysis model, volumes of distribution were calculated from fits of the kinetic data 25-90 min post-yohimbine injection. Amphetamine decreased [11C]yohimbine volume of distribution in the brain regions under investigation, including the thalamus, caudate nucleus, and cortical regions. These data suggest that the binding of [11C]yohimbine to alpha 2 adrenoceptors may be displaceable by increases in synaptic concentrations of the endogenous ligand, NA, and possibly dopamine, suggesting the possibility that [11C]yohimbine may be used as a surrogate marker of NA release in vivo.

Recent findings Neuroimaging studies using T1 structural MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) distinguish between patients with FTLD and Alzheimer's disease, although the reliability of these group-level findings in individual patients has been assessed only rarely. However, innovative analyses such as support vector machine approaches are able to integrate T1 and DTI imaging results and to identify specific MRI profiles that distinguish between individual patients with FTLD and Alzheimer's disease. Novel radioligand positron emission tomography assessments also can recognize Alzheimer's disease patients with a clinical phenotype resembling that seen in FTLD. Biofluid studies identify about 15% of patients with FTLD due to a genetic mutation that is associated with the specific histopathologic features of TDP-43 or a tauopathy. Other genetically-based risk factors and targeted proteomic searches of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid have suggested additional markers in sporadic cases of FTLD that will lead to the identification of patients with TDP-43 or tau histopathology. Summary Great progress has been made in developing biomarkers for FTLD, but additional work is needed to extend these advances so that the histopathologic abnormality causing FTLD can be specified in an individual patient.

[I-123]-IBVM is a highly selective radioligand for in vivo visualization of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) using single photon emission computed tomography. This study compares different noninvasive methods using the occipital cortex as a reference region for the quantification of [I-123]IBVM binding in six older, healthy volunteers: two kinetic analyses based on one-tissue (1TCM) or two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), one linear and one multilinear analysis, and a simplified peak equilibrium analysis. Time-activity curves were well described by a 1TCM for all regions. The 2TCM converged reliably only in the striatum. Goodness of fit was not improved by using a 2TCM as compared with a 1TCM. The multilinear analysis gave binding potentials similar to the 1TCM while being more robust. The peak equilibrium method might prove to be a useful simplified analysis. The binding potentials obtained with reference region methods strongly correlated with results from invasive blood-sampling analysis. Noninvasive quantification of [I-123]-IBVM data provides reliable estimates of VAChT binding, which is most valuable to study neurodegenerative diseases with specific cholinergic alteration.

Frequency of pancreatic beta-cell autoimmunity markers in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease	MEDICINA-BUENOS AIRES			English	Article						thyroid disease; diabetes; immunological markers; autoimmunity	GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; ISLET-CELL; DIABETES-MELLITUS; ANTIBODY POSITIVITY; INSULIN-ANTIBODIES; ADULT-ONSET; AUTOANTIBODIES; PROTEIN; ORGAN; DIAGNOSIS	A total of 305 ambulatory patients recruited at the Division of Endocrinology, Hospital de Clinicas, University of Buenos Aires, with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) were studied to search for associations between autoimmune thyroid disease and presence of serum markers of autoimmune diabetes mellitus. Screening for markers of pancreatic beta-cell autoimmunity was performed by radioligand binding assays (RBA) as follows: autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GADA) and proinsulin (PAA) were determined in all sera, whereas autoantibodies to protein tyrosine phosphatase (IA-2A) and insulin (IAA) were additionally measured in,200 sera randomly selected from the total collection. In addition, every GADA positive serum among the remaining 105 sera was systematically tested for the presence of IA-2A and IAA. In the cohort of 305 AITD patients 22 (7.2%) were previously diagnosed as type 1, type 2 or insulin-requiring type 2 diabetics. Ten of these patients presented serum marker positivity specific for beta-cell autoantigens and 12 were marker negative. On the other hand, considering the majority of non-diabetic AITD patients (n=283), beta-cell marker positivity was detected in 17 individuals (6.0%). The prevalence of autoimmune diabetes markers was much higher in the studied population than in the general population utilized as a control group, and GADA was the most frequent marker.

Modulatory effects of heparin and short-length oligosaccharides of heparin on the metastasis and growth of LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells <i>in vivo</i>	BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						CXCL12; CXCR4; glycosaminoglycan; metastasis; breast cancer	LOW-MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; BIOLOGICAL-ACTIVITIES; CHEMOKINE RECEPTORS; GLYCOSAMINOGLYCANS; SULFATE; BINDING; ANGIOGENESIS; CARCINOMA; CXCR4; INVOLVEMENT	Expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 allows breast cancer cells to migrate towards specific metastatic target sites which constitutively express CXCL12. In this study, we determined whether this interaction could be disrupted using short-chain length heparin oligosaccharides. Radioligand competition binding assays were performed using a range of heparin oligosaccharides to compete with polymeric heparin or heparan sulphate binding to I 125 CXCL12. Heparin dodecasaccharides were found to be the minimal chain length required to efficiently bind CXCL12 (71% inhibition; P < 0.001). These oligosaccharides also significantly inhibited CXCL12-induced migration of CXCR4-expressing LMD MDA-MB 231 breast cancer cells. In addition, heparin dodecasaccharides were found to have less anticoagulant activity than either a smaller quantity of polymeric heparin or a similar amount of the low molecular weight heparin pharmaceutical product, Tinzaparin. When given subcutaneously in a SCID mouse model of human breast cancer, heparin dodecasaccharides had no effect on the number of lung metastases, but did however inhibit ( Po0.05) tumour growth (lesion area) compared to control groups. In contrast, polymeric heparin significantly inhibited both the number (P < 0.001) and area of metastases, suggesting a differing mechanism for the action of polymeric and heparin-derived oligosaccharides in the inhibition of tumour growth and metastases.

In order to identify an effective PET radioligand for in vivo assessment of the GlyT-2 transporter, 3-(3-[F-18]fluoropropoxy)-4-(benzyloxy)-N-((1-dimethylaminocyclopentyl) methyl)-5-methoxybenzamide ([F-18]3), a novel analog of 4-benzyloxy-3,5-dimethoxy-N-[(1-dimethylaminocyclopentyl) methyl]benzamide was synthesized using a one-pot, two-step method. The NCA radiotluorination of 1,3-propanediol di-p-tosylate in the presence of K2CO3 and Kryptofix-222 in acetonitrile gave 81% 3-[18F]fluoropropyl tosylate, which was subsequently coupled with 4-benzyloxy-3-hydroxy-5-methoxy-N-[(1-dimethylaminocyclopentyl) methyl]benzamide in the same reaction vessel. Solvent extraction and HPLC (Eclipse XDB-C8 column, 80/20/0.1 MeOH/H2O/Et3N, 3.0 ml/min) gave [F-18]3 in 98.5% radiochemical purity. The radiochemical yield was determined to be 14.0-16.2% at EOS, and the specific activity was 1462 +/- 342 GBq/mu mol. The time of synthesis and purification was 128 min. The final product was prepared as a sterile saline solution suitable for in vivo use. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

A comparison between MAO-A and MAO-B, binding of the endogenous beta-carboline [H-3]harmane, and I-BS, has been made using sections from brain and kidney. The loss of binding to MAO-A in the knockout animals was confirmed using the selective radioligand [H-3]Ro41-1049, with labelling reduced to background levels. The binding of [H-3]Ro19-6327 to MAO-B was unaffected, indicating no change in this isoform in response to the loss of MAO-A. A reduction in binding to the I-2-BS, as labelled by both [H-3]idazoxan and [H-3]2-BFI (2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline), was seen in the MAO-A knockout animals in both brain and kidney sections, whereas binding to the I-1-BS in kidney sections remained unchanged. The loss of I-2 binding was found to be regionally dependent and was positively correlated with the relative expression of MAO-A in specific regions in the wild-type animals. Using the MAO-A knockout mice it was also possible to demonstrate a non-MAO-A population of binding sites labelled by the putative I-BS endogenous ligand, harmane.(2)	Univ Bristol, Sch Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England; Univ Paris Sud, Fac Pharm, Orsay, France; Univ Bristol, Henry Wellcome LINE, Psychopharmacol Unit, Bristol, Avon, England	University of Bristol; Universite Paris Saclay; University of Bristol	Robinson, ESJ (corresponding author), Univ Bristol, Sch Med Sci, Dept Pharmacol, Univ Walk, Bristol BS8 1TD, Avon, England.	emma.s.j.robinson@bristol.ac.uk	Robinson, Emma s/A-4572-2010; Hudson, Alan L/C-3123-2013	Robinson, Emma s/0000-0002-1299-6541; nutt, david/0000-0002-1286-1401; Hudson, Alan/0000-0003-1105-7646					47	17	19	0	4	WILEY	HOBOKEN	111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA	0022-3042	1471-4159		J NEUROCHEM	J.

Up-regulation, an increase in numbers of radioligand-binding nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), occurs on exposure to nicotine at high concentrations. To determine whether altered gene expression might account for long term changes and up-regulation following nicotine exposure, we assessed effects of 1 h of 1 mm nicotine exposure on alteration of gene expression in the neuron-like SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma clonal line. Repeat and cross-controlled microarray analyses yielded a list of 17 genes from the initially screened similar to5,000 whose expression was consistently altered following nicotine treatment. Subsequent quantitative, real time reverse transcriptase PCR analyses confirmed altered expression in 14 of 16 genes tested. Further, the general nAChR antagonist, d-tubocurarine, blocked all but two of the observed changes in gene expression, indicating that these changes are dependent on nAChR activation. Use of other antagonists revealed that nAChR subtypes can differentially affect gene expression. The genes affected code for proteins that may be broadly categorized into four groups: transcription factors, protein processing factors, RNA-binding proteins, and plasma membrane-associated proteins. Our results suggest that nicotinic activation of nAChR may have a broad role in affecting cellular physiology through modulating gene expression.

Here, we characterize the binding of Calmodulin to purified neuronal NOS (nNOS). [I-125]Calmodulin bound to a single class of non-interacting and high affinity sites on nNOS. [I-125]Calmodulin binding achieved rapid saturation, was linear with nNOS concentration, and exhibited a strict dependence on [Ca2+]. Neither affinity nor extent of [I-125]Calmodulin binding was affected by L-arginine, NADPH or Tetrahydrobiopterin. Native Calmodulin and engineered Calmodulin homologs [i.e., duplicated N-terminal (CaMNN)] potently displaced [I-125]Calmodulin. CaMNN supported nNOS catalysis, but required similar to five-fold more Ca2+ for comparable activity with native Calmodulin. Taken with results from kinetic analyses of [I-125]Calmodulin association and dissociation, our findings suggest four sequential steps in activation of nNOS by Calmodulin: (1) Ca2+ binds to Calmodulin's C-lobe, (2) the C-lobe of Calmodulin binds NOS, (3) Ca2+ binds to the N-lobe of Calmodulin, and (4) the N-lobe binds to nNOS. Activation of nNOS only occurs after completion of step (4), with the displacement of nNOS's autoinhibitory insert. Upon intracellular Ca2+ sequestration, deactivation of nNOS would proceed in reverse order. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V All rights reserved.

The presence of VR1 in the dorsal root, trigeminal, and nodose ganglia has been firmly established, but it is unclear in the gut, despite this VR1 may be important for gastric mucosal homeostasis. In this study we used an antibody and a radioligand to show the distribution of vanilloid receptors (VRs) in rat stomach and to characterize it. The deaf-ferentiation of capsaicin-sensitive nerves in rats was induced by consecutive injections of capsaicin. VR1-immunopositive nerve endings were predominantly found in the mucous neck cells of the proliferation zone, and around blood vessels in the submucosa. Radioreceptor assay using [H-3]-resiniferatoxin (RTX) revealed the existence of high affinity and single-class binding site in the membrane fractions of the mucosa. Capsaicin completely inhibited the specific binding of [H-3]-RTX. Both the VR1 immunoreactivity and the receptor density of [H-3]-RTX binding sites significantly reduced by the application of capsaicin for prolonged periods of time in the mucosa of rats. Our results indicate that VRS are expressed in the rat stomach, and suggest that they may be involved in mucosal protection by increasing cell proliferation and blood flow.

Charged residues of the amino terminus and the first extracellular loop of CXCR2 were targeted for point mutagenesis studies, Seven separate CXCR2 mutants (Glu7, Asp9, Glu12, Asp13, Lys108, Asn110, and Lys120, all to Ala) were generated, Based on the Scatchard analysis of radioligand binding studies, the following amino acids mere deemed critical for ligand binding: (i) Asp9, Glu12, Lys108, and Lys120 for IL-8 and (ii) Glu7, Asp9, and Glu12 for GRO alpha. Point mutations En the amino terminus domain (Asp9 and Glu12) and the first extracellular loop (Lys108, Asn110, and Lys120) of CXCR2 reduced cell activation to all three ligands as measured by changes in intracellular calcium concentration, In conclusion, high-affinity binding of IL-8, NAP-2, and GRO alpha to CXCR2 involves interaction with specific and different amino acid residues of CXCR2, Furthermore, we propose that the CXCR2 amino acid residues required for cell activation are not necessarily the same residues required for ligand binding.

CB1 receptor-binding sites were detected by the highaffinity antagonist radioligand [I-125]AM-251. In ECV304 cells, both the highly potent synthetic cannabinoid agonist HU-210 and the endogenous ligand anandamide induce activation of mitogen-activated protein (R IAP) kinase, and the effect of HU-210 was completely blocked, whereas the effect of anandamide was partially inhibited by SR141716A, a selective CB1 receptor antagonist. Transfection of ECV304 cells with CB1 receptor antisense, but not sense, oligonucleotides caused the same pattern of inhibition as SR141716A, This provides more definitive evidence for the involvement of CBI receptors in MAP kinase activation and suggests that anandamide may also activate MAP kinase via an additional, CB1 receptor-independent: SR141716A-resistant mechanism. The MAP kinase activation by anandamide in ECV304 cells requires genistein-sensitive tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C (PKC), and anandamide also activates p38 kinase and c-Jun kinase. These findings indicate that CB1 receptors located in human vascular endothelium are functionally coupled to the MAP kinase cascade.

Selective S1R agonists represent a new class of therapeutic agent for treating neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, however, to date, no S1R ligand has been approved for therapeutic purposes. We used three potential methods on known and potential S1R ligands to develop an unambiguous high-throughput cell screen for S1R activity. We screened known and potential S1R ligands using radioligand binding and previously reported markers of S1R activity including BDNF release, modulation of IP3 mediated calcium release, and modulation of NGF-induced neurite sprouting. Here, we present results several prototypical S1R compounds and some compounds with the potential for drug repurposing. Using an in-situ ELISA approach we demonstrated that these compounds could stimulate S1R-mediated BDNF release, which is a valuable therapeutic property since BDNF plays a critical role in neuronal support. These compounds were classified as S1R agonists because the BDNF response was comparable to the prototypical agonist 4-PPBP and because it could be reversed by a S1R selective concentration of the antagonist BD1063. When modulation of IP3 mediated calcium response and NGF-induced neurite sprouting were used as a measure of S1R activation, we were unable to reproduce the published results and determined that they are not reliable measures for evaluating functional properties of S1R ligands.

Subjects and methods: Non-diabetic FDR of T1DM patients were interviewed and blood was drawn for autoantibodies measurement (GADA, IA-2A, IAA, ZnT8A). Serum samples were analyzed by standard radioligand binding assays performed at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (GADA, IAA and IA2A), and at the Skane University Hospital, Sweden (ZnT8A). The FDR were interviewed by phone after 10 years to determine if they had developed T1DM. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed and results were described as means and standard deviation (SD). Results: 81 individuals were analyzed. Thirteen subjects had positive autoantibodies associated with T1DM.10 were positive for 1 autoantibody and 3 subjects were positive for multiple autoantibodies (1 of them showed positivity for 2 autoantibodies - GADA, ZnT8A - and the other two were positive for 3 autoantibodies - GADA, IA2A, ZnT8A). The 3 subjects with multiple positive autoantibodies developed T1DM within 10 years. Conclusions: In Brazilian FDR of T1DM patients, the positivity for multiple autoantibodies indicate a greater chance of progression to T1DM, similar to observed in Caucasians. ZnT8A was helpful in the risk assessment for T1DM development.

Exposure to antipsychotic medication has been suggested to be a likely source of this heterogeneity, and thus there is a need for studies of patients at early stages of the disorder who have not been exposed to such drugs. Methods: Here, we compared 17 healthy control subjects and 18 first-episode neuroleptic naive patients with schizophrenia or schizophreniform psychosis using positron emission tomography and the D1-dopamine receptor radioligand [C-11]SCH23390. Results: We observed a statistically significant difference in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Contrary to our expectations, patients had less D1-dopamine receptor availability with a moderate effect size. In a Bayesian analysis, we show that the data are over 50 times more likely to have occurred under the decrease as opposed to the increase hypothesis. This effect was not global, as our analysis showed that the null hypothesis was preferred over either hypothesis in the striatum. Conclusions: This investigation represents the largest single sample of neuroleptic-naive patients examined for D1-dopamine receptor availability using PET and suggests a reduction of prefrontal D1-dopamine receptor density in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, further work will be required to reach a consensus.

Here, we investigated brain 5-HT levels, as indexed by 5-HT4 receptor binding, in chronic migraine patients and evaluated whether these were associated with migraine frequency. Methods Sixteen chronic migraine patients underwent a dynamic PET scan after injection of [C-11]SB207145, a specific 5-HT4 receptor radioligand. Data from 15 episodic migraine patients and 16 controls were included for comparison. Quantification of 5-HT4 receptor binding was used as a proxy for brain 5-HT levels, since 5-HT4 receptor binding is inversely related to brain 5-HT levels. Results Chronic migraine patients had 9.1% (95% CI: [-17%; -1.0%]) lower 5-HT4 receptor binding compared to controls (p = 0.039). There was no difference in 5-HT4 receptor binding between chronic and episodic migraine patients (p = 0.48) and no association between number of monthly migraine days and 5-HT4 receptor binding (slope estimate 0.003, 95% CI: [-0.004; 0.715], p = 0.39). Conclusion The finding of low 5-HT4 receptor binding suggests that cerebral levels of 5-HT are elevated in chronic migraine patients. This is in line with observations made in patients with episodic migraine. Elevated brain 5-HT levels may thus be an inherent trait of the migraine brain rather than a risk factor for conversion from episodic to chronic migraine.

In the present study, we have developed a brain shuttle for active transport of antibodies across the BBB by receptor-mediated transcytosis. We have thus recombinantly fused two single-chain variable fragments (scFv) of the transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody 8D3 to the light chains of mAb158, an antibody selectively binding to A beta protofibrils, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite the two TfR binders, a monovalent interaction with TfR was achieved due to the short linkers that sterically hinder bivalent binding to the TfR dimer. The design enabled efficient receptor-mediated brain uptake of the fusion protein. Two hours after administration, brain concentrations were 2-3% of the injected dose per gram brain, comparable to small molecular drugs and 80-fold higher than unmodified mAb158. After three days, fusion protein concentrations in AD transgenic mouse brains were 9-fold higher than in wild type mice, demonstrating high in vivo specificity. Thus, our innovative recombinant design markedly increases mAb158 brain uptake, which makes it a strong candidate for improved Aa immunotherapy and as a PET radioligand for early diagnosis and evaluation of treatment effect in AD. Moreover, this approach could be applied to any target within the brain.

DA release can be measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using the radioligand [11C]raclopride. Its binding to DA D2 receptors (D2R) is sensitive and reciprocally related to endogenous DA, especially in the striatum. In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled within-subjects trial on 18 adult male volunteers we combined [11C]raclopride PET and a facial attractiveness rating task to establish whether intranasal OXT (24 IU) increased both the perceived attractiveness of unfamiliar female faces and striatal DA release compared with placebo administration. While our behavioral data confirmed that subjects rated unfamiliar female faces as more attractive following OXT treatment, and this correlated with an increased perfusion rate in the striatum, there was no evidence for altered [11C]raclopride binding in the striatum or pallidum. Instead under OXT we rather observed an increased [11C]raclopride binding and reduced perfusion rate in subregions of the right dorsomedial prefrontal gyrus and superior parietal gyrus. The absence of OXT effects on dopamine release and D2 receptors in brain reward centers, despite increased striatal activity, implies that the peptide may facilitate perceived attraction via non-dopaminergic actions.

Imaging this binding reaction in the brain remains a long sought goal in this field of study, and one of the primary challenges remaining is enabling soluble labeled PQQ to pass the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Previously, our group successfully labeled PQQ with Technetium-99m (Tc-99m), a metastable nuclear isomer used in radioactive isotope medical tests. In this work, we determined the specific binding of Tc-99m-PQQ and NMDAR by radioligand receptor assay. Ebselen (EB) and MK-801 both effectively inhibited Tc-99m-PQQ binding. We then investigated methods of opening the BBB using mannitol to enable entry to the brain by Tc-99m-PQQ. Our results showed that 7.5 mL/kg of 20 % mannitol effectively opened the BBB and 20 min was the optimum treatment time. Competition studies showed that mannitol did not affect the specific binding between Tc-99m-PQQ and NMDA receptors. Using this method, the amount of Tc-99m-PQQ uptake and retention was increased most significantly in the hippocampus and cortex, and re-opening the BBB did not affect binding. Together, our results demonstrate that the use of mannitol to open the BBB may contribute significantly to improving image quality by increasing the uptake amount of a water-soluble agent in brain.

Use of a mammalian gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist to characterize pituitary GnRH receptors in white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY			English	Article							SALMON SALMO-SALAR; REPRODUCTIVE-CYCLE; GENE-EXPRESSION; OVULATION; BINDING; RESPONSIVENESS; PROGESTERONE; SECRETION	Aim of the present study was to characterize the pituitary GnRH receptor in white sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus, using a superagonist analog of mammalian GnRH [D-Ala6, des-Gly10Pro9]-ethylamide and to investigate the possible effect of estradiol-17 beta treatment on the concentration and affinity of the GnRH receptor in immature white sturgeon. The binding of 125I-GnRH-A to sturgeon pituitary receptors was rapid and saturable at 4 degrees C and 20 degrees C. However, maximal binding at 20 degrees C was almost two-fold greater than the highest binding noted at 4 degrees C. Specific binding of radioligand was directly related to the amount of tissue included in the assay system over the range of 520 mg fresh tissue equivalents per ml. The binding capacity of 125I-GnRH-A with sturgeon pituitary tissue was much greater than radiolabeled GnRH. Administration of E2 to immature sturgeon caused an almost two-fold increase in GnRH-A binding capacity (E2 treated: Bmax = 2.87 fmoles 3 mg-1 FTE; control: Bmax = 1.70 fmoles 3 mg-1), and did not affect GnRH-A binding affinity (E2 treated: Ka = 0.13 x 1011 m-1; control: Ka = 0.15 x 1011 m-1). Overall, the study provides evidence that the GnRH analog is effective for characterizing the GnRH receptor in white sturgeon; however, more experimentation is necessary to determine whether E2 administration to immature white sturgeon can increase the GnRH receptor capacity.

J	Hislop, JN; Henry, AG; von Zastrow, M				Hislop, James N.; Henry, Anastasia G.; von Zastrow, Mark			Ubiquitination in the First Cytoplasmic Loop of μ-Opioid Receptors Reveals a Hierarchical Mechanism of Lysosomal Down-regulation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED-RECEPTORS; AGONIST-PROMOTED UBIQUITINATION; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING; ESCRT MACHINERY; RESENSITIZATION; INTERNALIZATION; DEGRADATION; DEPENDENCE; ENDOSOMES	mu-Type opioid receptors (MORs) are members of the large seven-transmembrane receptor family which transduce the effects of both endogenous neuropeptides and clinically important opioid drugs. Prolonged activation of MORs promotes their proteolytic degradation by endocytic trafficking to lysosomes. This down-regulation process is known to contribute to homeostatic regulation of cellular opioid responsiveness, but mechanisms that mediate and control MOR down-regulation have not been defined. We show here that lysosomal down-regulation of MORs is ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-dependent and involves ubiquitin-promoted transfer of internalized MORs from the limiting endosome membrane to lumen. We also show that MOR down-regulation measured by conventional radioligand binding assay is determined specifically by ubiquitination in the first cytoplasmic loop. Surprisingly, we were unable to find any role of ubiquitination in determining whether internalized receptors recycle or are delivered to lysosomes. Instead, this decision is dictated specifically by the MOR C-tail and occurs irrespectively of the presence or absence of receptor ubiquitination. Our results support a hierarchical organization of discrete ubiquitin-independent and -dependent sorting operations, which function non-redundantly in the conserved down-regulation pathway to mediate precise endocytic control. Furthermore, they show that this hierarchical mechanism discriminates the endocytic regulation of naturally occurring MOR isoforms. Moreover, they are the first to reveal, we believe, for any seven-transmembrane receptor, a functional role of ubiquitination in the first cytoplasmic loop.

J	Oh, KS; Lee, S; Lee, BH				Oh, Kwang-Seok; Lee, Sunghou; Lee, Byung Ho			Development of Filtration-Based Time-Resolved Fluorescence Assay for the High-Throughput Screening of Urotensin II Receptor Antagonist	ASSAY AND DRUG DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGIES			English	Article							VASOCONSTRICTOR; EXPRESSION; DISEASE; TISSUES; SYSTEM	The time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) receptor binding assay has many advantages over the traditional radioligand binding assay in terms of sensitivity and reproducibility for the screening of receptor ligands. The TRF-based urotensin receptor (UT) binding assay with an automatic vacuum filtration system was developed and evaluated for the high-throughput screening of UT receptor antagonists. For this assay development, the human recombinant urotensin II (UII) was modified by labeling europium at its N-terminal position (Eu-UII) and used as a fluorescent tracer. The microsomal membrane fraction of UT receptor was prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing the human UT receptor. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of UII from competition binding assays with Eu-UII were 2.76 nM, which is very similar to that of fluorescence polarization (FP)-based UT receptor binding experiment (2.18 nM). Comparing with the FP-based receptor binding assay for UII (Z' factor, 0.36), the current TRF assay presented improved Z' factor (0.76) with a relatively higher signal-to-background ratio (1.5 and 2.1, respectively). The known high-affinity UT receptor antagonists, palosuran and SB657510, exhibited IC(50) values of 23.6 and 73.4 nM, respectively, which were consistent with the IC(50) values from FP-based receptor binding assay (30.6 and 78.7 nM, respectively). These results suggest that our filtration-based TRF UT receptor binding assay can achieve the desired sensitivity with higher reproducibility to adapt for the high-throughput screening of compound libraries.

Aged dogs demonstrate both increased sensitivity to scopolamine impairment and decreased muscarinic receptor density	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Cholinergic system; Dog; Muscarinic receptors; Scopolamine; Memory	DEPENDENT COGNITIVE DECLINE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CHOLINERGIC HYPOTHESIS; BEAGLE DOG; TAU PHOSPHORYLATION; CANIS-FAMILIARIS; WORKING-MEMORY; SELECTIVE LOSS; ANIMAL-MODEL; ATTENTION	Memory deficits associated with aging and Alzheimer's disease have been linked to cholinergic dysfunction. The present study investigated this hypothesis by comparing the effects of the muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine on recent memory performance and by examining muscarinic receptor density in aged and young dogs. Scopolamine (15 mu g/kg; SC) was administered prior to testing young (M = 2.8 years) and aged (M = 13.0 years) dogs on a delayed-non-matching-to-position task (DNMP). Scopolamine significantly impaired performance of aged, but not young dogs. Muscarinic receptor density was assessed autoradiographically using the non-selective radioligand [H-3]quinuclidinylbenzilate. Aged dogs (M = 14.1 years) showed significantly decreased density of muscarinic receptors in all brain regions examined except the cerebellum compared to young dogs (M = 3.7 years). The results are consistent with those seen in aged humans and Alzheimer's patients and support the hypothesis of age-dependent cholinergic dysfunction in the dog, although this was not directly determined in the current study. These findings demonstrate that markers of cholinergic hypofunction, in addition to the natural cognitive decline and amyloid pathology previously noted, are seen in canine aging. Collectively, this supports the use of the aged dog as a model for examining early pathological events in the development of Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

No association between serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors and spirituality among patients with major depressive disorders or healthy volunteers	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						serotonin; 5-HT1A receptor; spirituality; positron emission tomography; major depressive disorder	TEMPERAMENT; CHARACTER	An earlier study (Borg et al., Am J Psychiatry 2003) found an inverse correlation between [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 ligand binding to 5-HT1A receptors and scores for self-transcendence, but no other of the six dimensions of the Temperament and Character Inventory, in a group of healthy males. The aim of this study was to investigate if the finding of an inverse correlation between spirituality and 5-HT1A could be seen in patients suffering from major depressive disorder or replicated among healthy volunteers. A total of 23 patients with major depressive disorder and 20 healthy volunteers were examined with PET using [carbonyl-C-11]-WAY-100635 as the radioligand. The personality traits were measured using the Finnish version of the Temperament and Character Inventory and correlated with ligand binding (BP). No significant correlations were found between the different Temperament and Character Inventory subscales and BP in any of the studied brain regions (amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal raphe nuclei, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, angular gyrus, inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri, medial prefrontal cortex orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, insular cortex, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and posterior cingulate cortex). These results do not support the idea that the serotonin system forms the biological basis of spiritual experiences among patients suffering from major depressive disorder or among healthy volunteers.

PROTEIN-KINASE-C; CELL-SURFACE EXPRESSION; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; TOURETTE-SYNDROME; BIPOLAR DISORDER; ACTIVATION; PHOSPHORYLATION; RECEPTORS; BINDING; GENE	The serotonin transporter (SEAT) mediates clearance of serotonin from the synapse, thereby, regulating extracellular serotonin concentrations. Radioligand uptake techniques are typically used to assess SEAT function in tissue and heterologous expression systems. The need for sufficient protein in samples, however, requires use of homogenate preparations, potentially masking effects limited to specific cell populations. 4-(4-(dimethylamino)-styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP(+)) is a fluorescent monoamine transporter substrate that has been used for real-time monitoring of dopamine and norepinephrine transporter function in single cells. The present live cell imaging studies examine the utility of ASP for quantifying human SEAT function in HEK293 and neuroblastoma cells. We show rapid membrane binding and intracellular ASP(+) accumulation in human SERT-expressing cells. Accumulation is saturable; dependent on temperature and the presence of sodium and chloride in the media, and attenuated by serotonin. Acute or prolonged exposure of cells to serotonin re-uptake inhibitors produces a concentration-dependent decrease in accumulation. Similar effects are produced by protein kinase C activation whereas p38 MAPK activation increases ASP(+) accumulation. These data demonstrate the validity of ASP(+) as a probe for monitoring SEAT function in living cells. Alterations in SEAT binding and uptake can be quantified in the same cell and use of a within-cell design permits analysis of time-related alterations in SEAT function.

Individual subunits of GABA(A)/Benzodiazepine (BZ) receptor complex have been revealed to have different functional properties. alpha 5 subunit was reported to be related to learning and memory. Changes of a5 subunit in schizophrenia were reported in postmortem studies, but the results were inconsistent. In this study, we examined GABA(A)/BZ receptor using [C-11]Rol5-4513, which has relatively high affinity for (alpha 5 subunit, and its relation to clinical symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. [C-11]Rol5-4513 bindings of I I patients with schizophrenia (6 drug-naive and 5 drug-free) were compared with those of 12 age-matched healthy control subjects using positron emission tomography. Symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. [C-11]Rol5-4513 binding was quantified by binding potential (BP) obtained by the reference tissue model. [C-11] Ro15-4513 binding in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus was negatively correlated with negative symptom scores in patients with schizophrenia, although there was no significant difference in BP between patients and controls. GABAA/BZ receptor including alpha 5 subunit in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus might be involved in the pathophysiology of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This region has previously been shown to be a good antisense region and therefore we aimed to identify the subregions and/or thermodynamic parameters determining the antisense efficacy. Nine different PNA oligomers were conjugated to a cell-penetrating peptide, transportan, to enhance their cellular uptake. Concentration-dependent down-regulation of GalR1 protein expression in human melanoma cell line Bowes was measured by radioligand binding assay. No reduction of GalR1 mRNA level was observed upon PNA treatment, thus, the effect was concluded to be translational arrest. Judging from the EC50 values, antisense PNA oligomers targeting regions 24-38 (EC50 = 70 nM) or 27-38 (EC50 = 80 nM) were the most potent suppressors of protein expression. No parameter predicted by M-fold algorithm was found to correlate with the measured antisense activities. Presence of some subregions was found not to increase antisense efficiency of PNA. Presence of a short unpaired triplet between nucleotides 33 and 35 in the target region was, on the other hand, found to be the most critical for efficient GalR1 down-regulation. Thus, the results are of high impact in designing antisense oligomers. Specific results of this study demonstrate 20-fold more efficient antisense down-regulation of GalR1 as achieved before.

We recently identified a new protein, pituitary gland specific factor la (PGSF1a), that is specifically transcribed in the pituitary gland. In our investigation of anti-PGSF1a antibody for pituitary diseases, we examined it in patients with RA and other autoimmune diseases. We unexpectedly discovered the frequent existence of anti-PGSF1a antibody in patients with RA. We therefore examined the prevalence of this antibody to understand its clinical significance in RA. Methods. Anti-PGSF1a antibody was detected by radioligand assay using recombinant 35 S-labelled PGSF1a protein. Antibody activity is expressed as an index that was obtained by comparison with normal pooled serum. Results. RA patients had a significantly higher mean anti-PGSF1a antibody index (n = 46, 1.28 +/- 0.38, P < 0.001) than healthy controls (n = 36, 1.04 ± 0.13). Indices greater than the cut-off value (mean + 2 S.D. of healthy controls) were found in 43.5% (20/46) and 10.0% (2/20) of patients with RA and osteoarthritis, respectively. There was no correlation between the activities of anti-PGSF1a antibodies and titres of rheumatoid factor (RF) or serum C-reactive protein concentrations, but RA patients with more erosive disease had a higher mean anti-PGSF1a antibody index. Four of eight sera samples obtained from RF-negative RA patients were positive for anti-PGSF1a antibodies. Conclusion. Anti-PGSF1a antibody is a useful new marker for the diagnosis of RA, especially for RF-negative RA, and may relate to clinical manifestations of RA.

In the present study, we examine the kinetics of sequestration of beta(1)-adrenergic receptor and beta(3)-adrenergic receptor subtypes by radioligand binding assays using whole cells ('whole cell binding assays'). We found that HEK293T cells, but not COS1 cells, were readily and uniformly detached from the culture dish upon exposure to ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Using this property of HEK293T cells, we conducted whole cell binding assays using a hydrophilic antagonist ([H-3]CGP-12177) and HEK293T cells transiently overexpressing human beta(1)-adrenergic receptor or beta(3)-adrenergic receptor. The B-max and K-d values were 5.96 +/- 0.97 pmol/mg protein and 1 +/- 0.23 nM for the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, and were 1.84 +/- 0.13 pmol/mg protein and 44.7 +/- 2.5 nM for the beta(3)-adrenergic receptor, respectively. Isoproterenol treatment, but not 6-[3-(dimethylamino)propionyl]forskolin treatment, for 2 h resulted in a dose-dependent loss of the number of the cell surface beta(1)-adrenergic receptor. At 100 muM, 36.6 +/- 5.7% of the cell surface beta(1)-adrenergic receptor was lost. In contrast, the cell surface beta(3)-adrenergic receptor number remained unchanged with isoproterenol treatment. Thus, beta(1)-adrenergic receptor sequestrates upon agonist stimulation but the same agonist stimulation does not induce beta(3)-adrenergic receptor sequestration, as demonstrated by our whole cell binding assays.

Vesicles were loaded with Ca2+ and membrane potentials were generated by establishing K+ gradients across the vesicle using the ionophore, valinomycin. Anandamide, in the range of 1-100 mu M, inhibited depolarization-induced efflux responses. Anandamide also functionally modulated the effects of nifedipine (1-10 mu M) and Bay K 8644 (1 mu M) on Ca2+ flux responses. Pretreatment with the specific cannabinoid receptor antagonist, SR141716A (1 mu M), pertussis toxin (5 mu g/ml), the amidohydrolase inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mM) or the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (5 mu M) did not alter the inhibition of efflux responses by anandamide. Arachidonic acid (10-100 mu M) also effectively inhibited Ca-45(2+) efflux from membrane vesicles. in radioligand binding studies, it was found that both anandamide and arachidonic acid inhibited the specific binding of [H-3]PN 200-110 to transverse tubule membranes with IC50 values of 4.4 +/- 0.7 and 13.4 +/- 3,5 mu M, respectively. These results indicate that anandamide, independent of cannabinoid receptor activation, directly inhibits the function of voltage-dependent calcium channels and modulates the specific binding of calcium channel ligands of the dihydropyridine class.

PD-L1 expression in tumors may predict treatment response to immunotherapy. Indeed, ongoing clinical studies utilize a few PD-L1 radiotracers to assess PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker for immunotherapy. Here, we present a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer called [Ga-68]BMSH, which is derived from a small molecule inhibitor specifically targeting the binding site of PD-L1. The inhibitor was modified to optimize its in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and enable chelation of Ga-68. In vitro evaluation revealed [Ga-68]BMSH possessed a strong binding affinity, high specificity, and rapid internalization in PD-L1 overexpressing cells. Biodistribution studies showed that PD-L1 overexpressing tumors had an uptake of [Ga-68]BMSH at 4.22 +/- 0.65%ID/g in mice, while the number was 2.23 +/- 0.41%ID/g in PD-L1 low-expressing tumors. Micro-PET/CT imaging of tumor-bearing mice further confirmed that, compared to [F-18]FDG, [Ga-68]BMSH can specifically identify tumors with varying levels of PD-L1 expression. Our findings suggest that the [Ga-68]BMSH is a PD-L1 radioligand with ideal imaging properties, and its further application in the clinical screening of PD-L1 overexpressing tumors may improve ORR for immunotherapy.

The PET radioligand Ga-68-DO3A-VS-Tuna-2 (Ga-68-Tuna-2) was developed to yield a noninvasive imaging marker for GCGR target distribution and drug target engagement in humans. Methods: The biodistribution and dosimetry of Ga-68-Tuna-2 was assessed by PET/CT in 13 individuals with type 2 diabetes as part of a clinical study assessing the occupancy of the dual GCGR/glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist SAR425899. Binding of Ga-68-Tuna-2 in liver and reference tissues was evaluated and correlated to biometrics (e.g., weight or body mass index) or other biomarkers (e.g., plasma glucagon levels). Results: Ga-68-Tuna-2 binding was seen primarily in the liver, which is in line with the strong expression of GCGR on hepatocytes. The kidneys demonstrated high excretion-related retention, whereas all other tissue demonstrated rapid washout. The SUV55 (min) (SUV during the last 10-min time frame, 50-60 min after administration) uptake endpoint was sensitive to endogenous levels of glucagon. Ga-68-Tuna-2 exhibited a safe dosimetry profile and no adverse events after intravenous administration. Conclusion: Ga-68-Tuna-2 can be used for safe and accurate assessment of the GCGR in human. It may serve as an important tool in understanding the in vivo pharmacology of novel drugs engaging the GCGR.

Virtual Rehabilitation in Parkinson Disease A Dopamine Transporter Imaging Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL MEDICINE & REHABILITATION			English	Article						Parkinson Disease; Virtual Rehabilitation; Dopamine Transporter; SPECT	TC-99M-TRODAT-1 SPECT; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; BALANCE; MOTOR; EXERCISE; ATTENTION; DEFICITS; REALITY; GAIT	Objective The aim of the study was to verify the effect of a virtual rehabilitation protocol for patients with Parkinson disease, primarily assessing striatal dopamine transporters and secondarily motor symptoms and quality of life. Design Nineteen patients with Parkinson disease underwent an 8-wk virtual rehabilitation protocol using XBOX 360S. Evaluation of dopamine transporters was performed by single-photon emission computed tomography using TRODAT-1 as the radioligand. Participants were clinically assessed using the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale to quantify motor symptoms. Moreover, the Parkinson Disease Questionnaire and Short-Form Health Status Survey were used to assess quality of life and the Berg Balance Scale to assess balance. Results Regarding our primary outcome, dopamine transporter was significantly increased in the putamen contralateral to the clinically most affected body side (P = 0.034) considering preintervention and postintervention measurements. Furthermore, we observed significant improvement in Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (10-point reduction, P = 0.001), Parkinson Disease Questionnaire (11.3-point reduction, P = 0.001), Short-Form Health Status Survey ("Functional capacity," P = 0.001; "Pain," P = 0.006; and "Mental Health" domains, P < 0.001), and Berg Balance Scale (5-point increase, P = 0.015). Conclusions In our group of Parkinson disease patients, this virtual rehabilitation protocol enabled a dopamine transporter increase in the region of the putamen contralateral to the clinically most affected body side. Moreover, motor signs and quality of life were significantly improved.	[Toldo, Juliana M.

Since variations in pharmacokinetics and metabolism of a compound occur in different species, careful selection of a suitable model species is mandatory to obtain valid data. This study focuses on species differences in the in vitro metabolism of three xanthine-derived ligands for the A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR), which, in their F-18-labeled form, can be used to image A(1)AR via PET. In vitro intrinsic clearance and metabolite profiles of 8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine (CPFPX), an established A(1)AR-ligand, and two novel analogs, 8-cyclobutyl-3-(3-fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine (CBX) and 3-(3-fluoropropyl)-8-(1-methylcyclobutyl)-1-propylxanthine (MCBX), were determined in liver microsomes from humans and preclinical animal species. Molecular mechanisms leading to significant differences between human and animal metabolite profiles were also examined. The results revealed significant species differences regarding qualitative and quantitative aspects of microsomal metabolism. None of the tested animal species fully matched human microsomal metabolism of the three A(1)AR ligands. In conclusion, preclinical evaluation of xanthine-derived A(1)AR ligands should employ at least two animal species, preferably rodent and dog, to predict in vivo behavior in humans. Surprisingly, rhesus macaques appear unsuitable due to large differences in metabolic activity towards the test compounds.

A Pharmacological Comparison of Two Isomeric Nicotinic Receptor Agonists: The Marine Toxin Isoanatabine and the Tobacco Alkaloid Anatabine	MARINE DRUGS			English	Article						acetylcholine; alkaloid; Alzheimer's disease; anabaseine; anabasine; anatabine; inflammation; isoanatabine; nemertine; nicotine; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; tobacco; toxin	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SMOKE CONSTITUENTS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; ALPHA-7; BINDING; ANABASINE; DETERMINANTS; ANNOUNCEMENT; ENANTIOMERS	Many organisms possess "secondary" compounds to avoid consumption or to immobilize prey. While the most abundant or active compounds are initially investigated, more extensive analyses reveal other "minor" compounds with distinctive properties that may also be of biomedical and pharmaceutical significance. Here, we present an initial in vitro investigation of the actions of two isomeric tetrahydropyridyl ring-containing anabasine analogs: isoanatabine, an alkaloid isolated from a marine worm, and anatabine, a relatively abundant minor alkaloid in commercial tobacco plants. Both compounds have a double bond that is distal to the piperidine ring nitrogen of anabasine. Racemic isoanatabine and anatabine were synthesized and their S- and R-enantiomers were isolated by chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Both isoanatabines displayed higher efficacies at alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) relative to the anatabines; R-isoanatabine was most potent. Radioligand binding experiments revealed similar alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR binding affinities for the isoanatabines, but R-anatabine affinity was twice that of S-anatabine. While the two anatabines and S-isoanatabine were highly efficacious agonists at alpha 7 nAChRs, R-isoanatabine was only a weak partial agonist. The four compounds share an ability to stimulate both alpha 4 beta 2 and alpha 7 nAChRs, a property that may be useful in developing more efficacious drugs to treat neurodegenerative and other medical disorders.

In this study, kinetics modeling methods were applied and compared for quantifying regional brain uptake of the VAChT-specific positron emission tomography radiotracer, ((-)-(1-(-8-(2-fluoroethoxy)-3-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)piperidin-4-yl)(4-fluorophenyl)-methanone) ([F-18]VAT) in macaques. Total volume distribution (V-T) estimates were compared for one-tissue compartment model (1TCM), two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), Logan graphic analysis (LoganAIF) and multiple linear analysis (MA1) with arterial blood input function using data from three macaques. Using the cerebellum-hemispheres as the reference region with data from seven macaques, three additional models were compared: reference tissue model (RTM), simplified RTM (SRTM), and Logan graphic analysis (LoganREF). Model selection criterion indicated that a) 2TCM and SRTM were the most appropriate kinetics models for [F-18]VAT; and b) SRTM was strongly correlated with 2TCM (Pearson's coefficients r > 0.93, p < 0.05). Test-retest studies demonstrated that [F-18]VAT has good reproducibility and reliability (TRV < 10%, ICC > 0.72). These studies demonstrate [F-18]VAT is a promising VAChT positron emission tomography tracer for quantitative assessment of VAChT levels in the brain of living subjects.

The association and dissociation kinetics of [H-3]tamsulosin for recombinant human alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes were compared with those of [H-3]prazosin. Tamsulosin competitively inhibited [H-3]prazosin binding to human alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors (pK(i) values were 10.38, 9.33, 9.85) indicating 11 and 3.4-fold higher affinities for human alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor than those for alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, respectively. The affinity of tamsulosin for the human awadrenoceptor was, respectively, 5, 9.9, 38, 120, 280, 400, 1200 and 10000 fold higher than those of silodosin, prazosin, 5-methylurapidil, terazosin, alfuzosin, naftopidil, urapidil and BMY7378, respectively. [H-3]Tamsulosin dissociated from the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor slower than from the alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors (alpha(1B)>alpha(1D)>alpha(1A)). Moreover, [H-3]tamsulosin dissociated slower than [H-3]prazosin from the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor and faster from the alpha(1B)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors. In conclusion, tamsulosin potently and selectively antagonized alpha(1A/1D)-adrenoceptor ligand binding, and slowly dissociated from the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor subtype.

Initial studies of this binding site indicate that it is not expressed in the adrenal, liver or kidney of the rat and mouse. To determine if this binding site occurs in other mouse tissues, 8 tissues were assayed for expression of this binding site by radioligand binding assay and compared with the expression of this binding site in the forebrain. Particulate fractions of homogenates of testis, epididymis, seminal vesicles, heart, spleen, pancreas, lung, skeletal muscle, and forebrain were incubated with I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II in the presence or absence of 0.3 mM parachloromercuribenzoate plus 10 mu M losartan and 10 mu M PD123319 (to saturate AT(1) and AT(2) receptors). Specific (3 mu M angiotensin II displaceable) high affinity binding occurred in the testis>forebrain>epididymis>spleen>pancreas>lung when parachloromercuribenzoate was present. Binding could not be reliably observed in heart, skeletal muscle and seminal vesicles. High affinity binding of I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) angiotensin II was observed in the absence of parachloromercuribenzoate in the pancreas on occasion. This suggests that this novel angiotensin binding site may have a functional role in these tissues. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we sought to determine if such data could be obtained in rat, with a microPET (R4, Concorde Microsystems). Methods Scans from isoflurane-anaesthetised rats (n=18, including six test-retest) were co-registered with magnetic resonance imaging data, and binding potential, blood to plasma ratio and radiotracer efflux were estimated according to a simplified reference tissue model. Results Values of binding potential for hippocampus (1.2), entorhinal cortex (1.1), septum (1.1), medial prefrontal cortex (1.0), amygdala (0.8), raphe nuclei (0.6), paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (0.5) and raphe obscurus (0.5) were comparable to those previously measured with PET in cats, non-human primates or humans. Test-retest variability was in the order of 10% in the larger brain regions (hippocampus, medial prefrontal and entorhinal cortex) and less than 20% in small nuclei such as the septum and the paraventricular hypothalamic, basolateral amygdaloid and raphe nuclei. Conclusions MicroPET brain imaging of 5-HT1A receptors with [F-18] MPPF thus represents a promising avenue for investigating 5-HT1A receptor function in rat.

The purpose of this study was to examine the test-retest reproducibility using a design tailored for future applied studies. Nine healthy male subjects were examined with PET and [C-11]MADAM under baseline conditions at two occasions 4-8 weeks apart. The subjects participated in a Phase 1 trial to which the present study was an addendum. Eight regions of interest were studied, including frontal cortex, hippocampal complex, and the raphe nuclei. All regions, but the raphe nuclei, were defined on MR-images to which the PET-images were coregistered using SPM2. Binding potentials were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model, with cerebellum as reference region. Test-retest data were calculated from the binding potentials, and included binding potential (BP) quotient, BP difference, and the intraclass correlation coefficient. The quotient was about one in all regions, and the mean difference varied between 0 and 11%. The intraclass correlation coefficient varied between 0.96 and 0.51 in the raphe nuclei and averaged bilateral regions. [C-11]MADAM was shown to have good to excellent reliability in measurements of 5-HTT binding in brain regions of interest in research on psychiatric disorders.

The 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is a key element in 5-HT neurotransmission. The current study aimed to investigate the binding of 5-HTT in the brain of patients with PD. We used single-photon emission computed tomography with a radioligand that specifically labels the 5-HTT. [I-123]nor-beta-CIT. Subjects comprised eight patients with current PD, eight patients with PD in remission. and eight healthy control subjects. The patient, with current PD showed a significant decrease in 5-HTT binding in the midbrain. in the temporal lobes and in the thalamus in comparison to the controls. The binding of 5-HTT in patients with PD in remission was similar to findings in the control group in the midbrain and in the temporal lobes, but lower in the thalamus. Regional 5-HTT binding significantly and negatively correlated with the severity of panic symptoms. These findings point to a dysregulation of the 5-HT system in PD patients. Altered function of 5-HTT appears to be related to the clinical status of patients. Clinical improvement in the patients in remission is associated with normalization of 5-HTT binding.

VOIs representing major structures of the rat brain were defined on a set of digitized cryosectioned images of the rat brain. For VOI placement, each PET study was registered with a synthetic PET target constructed from the VOI template. Registration was accomplished with an automated algorithm that maximized the mutual information content of the image volumes. The accuracy and precision of this method for VOI placement was determined using datasets from PET studies of the striatal dopamine and hippocampal serotonin systems. Each evaluated PET study could be registered to at least one synthetic PET target without obvious failure. Registration was critically dependent upon the initial position of the PET study relative to the synthetic PET target, but not dependent on the amount of synthetic PET target smoothing. An evaluation algorithm showed that resultant radioactivity concentration measurements of selected brain structures had errors = 2% due to misalignment with the corresponding VOI. Further, radioligand binding values calculated from these measurements were found to be more precise than those calculated from measurements obtained with manually drawn regions of interest (ROIs). Overall, evaluation results demonstrated that this atlas-derived VOI method can be used to obtain unbiased measurements of radioactivity concentration from PET studies. Its automated features, and applicability to different radioligands and brain regions, will facilitate quantitative rat brain PET assessment procedures. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

HD causes blisters because epithelial cells lose their attachments. Epithelial cell adhesion is under control of the local cytotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) working through the muscarinic and nicotinic receptor, mAChR and nAChR, classes expressed by epithelial cells. In this study, nitrogen mustard (NM)-a structural analog of HD-was used to elucidate the mechanism of vesicating effects of mustards in mucocutaneous tissues. NM caused cell detachment and cholinergic agents antagonized its effect. Radioligand binding inhibition experiments showed that NM binds to the ligand-binding site of ACh receptors (AChRs) of both classes. Ligation of AChRs on the cell membrane of keratinocytes (KC) and bronchial epithelial cells (BEC) with NM increased total esterolytic activity of serine proteinases (TEASP). Antagonists of both classes of AChRs, atropine and mecamylamine, diminished NM-induced changes, suggesting that the pathobiological effects of NM on KC and BEC result from an agonist-like degradation of ligated AChRs, predominantly of the muscarinic class. Thus, biological effects of NM on cell adhesion were antagonist-like, whereas its pharmacological effect on TEASP was agonist-like. These findings support a hypothesis that pharmacologic protection from the vesicating action of HD can be achieved by using cholinergic drugs. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein, the possibility of an interaction between these receptors was explored using a cloned cDNA that encodes a protein with I1R-like binding properties, designated imidazoline receptor antisera-selected (IRAS). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) sublines permanently expressing the human subtype alpha(2A)AR cDNA were transiently cotransfected with the human IRAS cDNA (pIRAS). Saturation radioligand binding experiments on membranes isolated from the various sublines allowed distinction between I1R and alpha(2A)AR. Transfection of pIRAS into either subline led to a rise in membrane I1R-binding sites. Immunoblotting revealed that IRAS was enriched in membranes more than in cytosolic fractions. Transfection of pIRAS in CHO cells harboring the alpha(2A)AR cDNA resulted in a twofold increase in alpha(2A)AR binding sites with no change in alpha(2A)AR binding affinity, compared with controls. Immunoblotting also revealed increased expression of membranous alpha(2A)AR by IRAS. Thus, pIRAS transfection led to I-1 binding sites and to an increase in alpha(2A)AR binding sites in CHO cells expressing the human alpha(2A)AR. Although the mechanism is unclear, this increase in binding sites may explain previous imidazoline drug effects suggestive of interactions between these two receptors.

Since exacerbation of hepatitis occurs in 5-10% of HCV patients receiving interferon-alpha treatment and may be success fully treated by immunosuppression afterwards, hepatitis C was also suspected to be associated with autoimmune hepatitis. LKM3 autoantibodies in chronic hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection and epitope recognition are discussed. Lately, endogenous and exogenous retroviruses have been investigated for the induction of autoimmune diseases. Human A type retroviral particles (HIAP), reverse transcriptase activity and anti-HIAP autoantibodies were detected in patients with Sjogren's syndrome. Anti-HIAP and anti-MN p24 autoantibodies are seen in systemic lupus erythematosus, primary biliary cirrhosis and multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis was even associated with a new human retrovirus called multiple sclerosis associated retrovirus (MSRV). In diabetes long terminal repeats (LTR) were detected in the HLA DQB1 locus, which was shown to associate with an increased risk of diabetes. A second retrovirus called IDDMK(1,2)22 was reported to code for a superantigen, which was implicated as a potential cause of diabetes. This hypothesis, however, was challenged repeatedly. Until now it is unknown whether endogenous retroviruses are aetiological agents of autoimmune diseases or an epiphenomenon, induced by coinfecting viruses (e.g. herpes viruses) and inflammatory processes.

By immunoenzymatic, zymographic, and radioligand binding methods and by quantitative polymerase chain reaction of the specific mRNA we have shown that both normal and DMD MSC produce u-PA and the plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and express u-PA receptors (Le-PAR). During the proliferation phase of their growth-differentiation program, MSC from DMD patients show more u-PAR than their normal counterpart, produce more plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and release low amounts of u-PA into the culture medium. By Boyden chamber Matrigel invasion assays we have shown that normal MSC are more prone than DMD cells to spontaneous invasion but, when subjected to a chemotactic gradient of u-PA, DMD MSC sense the ligand much better and to a greater extent than normal MSG. u-PA also stimulates proliferation of MSG, but no difference is observable between normal and DMD patients. Antagonization of u-PA/u-PAR interaction with specific anti-u-PA and anti-u-PAR monoclonal antibodies and with antisense oligonucleotides inhibiting u-PAR expression indicates that u-PA/u-PAR interaction is required in spontaneous and u-PA-induced invasion, as well as in u-PA-induced proliferation.

A benefit of imprinted polymers is the possibility to prepare sorbents with selectivity pre-determined for a particular substance, or group of structural analogues. The application most close to a wider acceptance is probably that of solid phase extraction for clean-up of environmental and biological samples. The improved selectivity of imprinted polymers compared with conventional sorbents may lead to cleaner chromatographic traces in the subsequent analytical separation. Furthermore, the solid phase extraction application does not suffer from drawbacks generally associated with imprinted polymers in chromatography, such as peak broadening and tailing. Most liquid chromatographic studies have focused on using imprinted polymers as chiral stationary phases for enantiomer separations. Also, the use of imprinted polymers as selective sorbents in capillary electrochromatography has been presented. For this purpose, a protocol to prepare superporous, monolithic imprinted polymer-based capillary columns has been developed. Due to the high affinities and selectivities often achievable, imprinted polymers have been considered as alternative binding entities in biosensors and in immunoassay type protocols. Here, high stability, easy preparation and ability to be used for assay of both aqueous and organic solvent based samples are advantages of the polymers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Synthesis and biodistribution of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]R107474, a new radiolabeled α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonist	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						[C-11]R107474; [C-11]formaldehyde; alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist; PET	RAT-BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; BINDING; ANTIDEPRESSANT; MIRTAZAPINE; MONOAMINES; RECEPTORS; AGONIST	R107474, 2-methyl-3-[2-(1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]furo[3,2-c]pyridin-2-yl)ethyl]-4H-pyrido[1,2-alpyrimidin-4-one, was investigated using in vitro and in vivo receptor assays and proved to be a potent and relatively selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist. Performed assays in vitro were inhibition of binding to a large number of neurotransmitter receptor sites, drug receptor binding sites, ion channel binding sites, peptide receptor binding sites, and the monoamine transporters in membrane preparations of brain tissue or of cells expressing the cloned human receptors. The compound has subnanomolar affinity for h alpha(2A)- and h alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors (K-i = 0.13 and 0.15 nM, respectively) and showed nanomolar affinity for the h alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors and 5-hydroxytryptamine(7) (h5-HT7) receptors (Ki = 1 and 5 nM, respectively). R107474 interacted weakly (Ki values ranging between 81 and 920 nM) with dopamine-hD(2L), -hD3 and -hD4, h5-HT1D-, wh5-HT1F-, h5-HT2A-, h5-HT2C-, and h5-HT5A receptors. The compound, tested up to 10 mu M, interacted only at micromolar concentrations or not at all with any of the other receptor or transporter binding sites tested in this study. In vivo alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor occupancy was measured by ex vivo autoradiography 1 h after subcutaneous (sc) administration of R107474. It was found that R 107474 occupies the alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors with an ED50 (95% confidence limits) of 0.014 mg/kg sc (0.009-0.019) and 0.026 mg/kg sc (0.022-0.030), respectively. Radiolabeled 2-methyl-3-[2-([1-C-11]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[4,5]furo[3,2-c]pyridin-2-yl)ethyl]-4H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrimidin-4-one ([C-11]R107474) was prepared and evaluated as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for studying central alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. [C-11]R107474 was obtained via a Pictet-Spengler reaction with [C-11]formaldehyde in 33 +/- 4% overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield. The total synthesis time was 55 min and the specific activity was 24-28 GBq/mu mol. The biodistribution of [C-11]R107474 in rats revealed that the uptake of [C-11]R 107474 after in vivo intravenous administration is very rapid; in most tissues (including the brain) it reaches maximum concentration at 5 min after tracer injection. In agreement with the known distribution of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the brain, highest uptake of radioactivity was observed in septum (3.54 +/- 0.52 ID/g, 5 min pi) and entorhinal cortex (1.57 +/- 0.10 ID/g, 5 min pi). Tissue/cerebellum concentration ratios for septum (5.38 +/- 0.45, 30 min pi) and entorhinal cortex (3.43 +/- 0.24, 30 min pi) increased with time due to rapid uptake followed by a slow washout. In vivo blocking experiments using the non-selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist mirtazapine demonstrated specific inhibition of [C-11]R107474 binding in selective brain areas. The receptor binding profile of mirtazapine is reported and the selectivity of inhibition of binding is discussed. These results suggest that [C-11]R107474 deserves further investigation as a potential radioligand for studying alpha(2)-adrenoceptors using PET. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Particularly, LRRK2-Gly2019Ser mutation was reported to alter the early phase of neuronal differentiation, increasing cell death. Selective inhibitors of LRRK2 kinase activity were considered as a promising therapeutic target for PD treatment. However, the development of effective brain-penetrant LRRK2 inhibitors remains challenging. Recently, we have developed a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for LRRK2 imaging and demonstrated preferable tracer properties in rodents. Herein, we evaluate [18F]PF-06455943 quantification methods in the nonhuman primate (NHP) brain using full kinetic modeling with radiometabolite-corrected arterial blood samples, and homologous blocking with two doses (0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg). Kinetic analysis results demonstrated that a two-tissue compartmental model and a Logan graphical analysis are appropriate for [18F]PF-06455943 PET quantification. In addition, we observed that total distribution volume (VT) values can be reliably estimated with as short as a 30 min scan duration. Homologous blocking studies confirmed the specific binding of [18F]PF-06455943 and revealed that the nonradioactive mass of PF-06455943 achieved 45-55% of VT displacement in the whole brain. This work supports the translation of [18F]PF-06455943 PET imaging for the human brain and target occupancy studies.

Preclinical Molecular PET-CT Imaging Targeting CDCP1 in Colorectal Cancer	CONTRAST MEDIA & MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN-1; FDG-PET/CT; TUMOR; INHIBITION; BIODISTRIBUTION; NANOMEDICINES; ANTIBODIES	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common malignancy in the world, with 22% of patients presenting with metastatic disease and a further 50% destined to develop metastasis. Molecular imaging uses antigen-specific ligands conjugated to radionuclides to detect and characterise primary cancer and metastases. Expression of the cell surface protein CDCP1 is increased in CRC, and here we sought to assess whether it is a suitable molecular imaging target for the detection of this cancer. CDCP1 expression was assessed in CRC cell lines and a patient-derived xenograft to identify models suitable for evaluation of radio-labelled 10D7, a CDCP1-targeted, high-affinity monoclonal antibody, for preclinical molecular imaging. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography was used to compare zirconium-89 (Zr-89)-10D7 avidity to a nonspecific, isotype control Zr-89-labelled IgG kappa 1 antibody. The specificity of CDCP1-avidity was further confirmed using CDCP1 silencing and blocking models. Our data indicate high avidity and specificity for of Zr-89-10D7 in CDCP1 expressing tumors at. Significantly higher levels than normal organs and blood, with greatest tumor avidity observed at late imaging time points. Furthermore, relatively high avidity is detected in high CDCP1 expressing tumors, with reduced avidity where CDCP1 expression was knocked down or blocked. The study supports CDCP1 as a molecular imaging target for CRC in preclinical PET-CT models using the radioligand Zr-89-10D7.

Compelling experimental evidence suggests that microglial activation is involved in the spread of tau tangles over the neocortex in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We tested the hypothesis that the spatial propagation of microglial activation and tau accumulation colocalize in a Braak-like pattern in the living human brain. We studied 130 individuals across the aging and AD clinical spectrum with positron emission tomography brain imaging for microglial activation ([C-11]PBR28), amyloid-beta (A beta) ([F-18]AZD4694) and tau ([F-18]MK-6240) pathologies. We further assessed microglial triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations and brain gene expression patterns. We found that [C-11]PBR28 correlated with CSF soluble TREM2 and showed regional distribution resembling TREM2 gene expression. Network analysis revealed that microglial activation and tau correlated hierarchically with each other following Braak-like stages. Regression analysis revealed that the longitudinal tau propagation pathways depended on the baseline microglia network rather than the tau network circuits. The co-occurrence of A beta, tau and microglia abnormalities was the strongest predictor of cognitive impairment in our study population.

Dendrimer Scaffold for the Amplification of In Vivo Pretargeting Ligations	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							METAL-CHELATING POLYMERS; ALDER CLICK CHEMISTRY; C-11-LABELED TETRAZINE; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; RADIOIMMUNOTHERAPY; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; OPTIMIZATION; CONJUGATION; STRATEGY; IN-111	The development of immunoconjugates requires a careful balance between preserving the functionality of the antibody and modifying the immunoglobulin with the desired cargo. Herein, we describe the synthesis, development, and in vivo evaluation of a novel bifunctional dendrimeric scaffold and its application in pretargeted PET imaging. The site-specific modification of the huA33 antibody with this dendrimeric scaffold yields an immunoconjugate-(ss)huA33-DEN-TCO-decorated with similar to 8 trans-cyclooctene (TCO) moieties, a marked increase compared to the similar to 2 TCO/mAb of a nondendrimeric control immunoconjugate ((ss)huA33-PEG(12)-TCO). Pretargeted PET imaging and biodistribution experiments were used to compare the in vivo performance of these two immunoconjugates in athymic nude mice bearing subcutaneous SW1222 human colorectal cancer xenografts. To this end, the mice were administered 100 mu g of each immunoconjugate followed 120 h later by the injection of a tetrazine-bearing radioligand, [Cu-64]Cu-SarAr-Tz. Pretargeting with (ss)huA33-DEN-TCO produced excellent tumoral uptake at 24 h (8.9 +/- 1.9 %ID/g), more than double that created by (ss)huA33-PEG(12)-TCO (4.1 +/- 1.3 %ID/g). Critically-and somewhat surprisingly-the attachment of the G(0.5) dendrimeric structures did not hamper the in vivo behavior of the immunoconjugate, suggesting that this versatile bifunctional scaffold may have applications beyond pretargeting.

Assessment of the pharmacological properties of 5-methoxyindole derivatives at 5-HT4 receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						5-HT4 receptor agonists; 5-methoxyindole derivatives; gastrointestinal tract; human colon; intestinal smooth muscle	CIRCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; HUMAN COLON; GUINEA-PIG; RAT ESOPHAGUS; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE; LIGANDS; ACTIVATION; MECHANISM; AGONISTS; ILEUM	Objectives The aim was to examine the biological activity of 5-methoxytryptamine derivatives at the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)4 receptor to explore the effect of substitution on the aliphatic amine of the 5-methoxyamine scaffold. Methods Three compounds were tested for affinity at the 5-HT4 receptor by radioligand binding and functional activity using guinea-pig ileum and human colon circular muscle preparations and also in the mouse whole gut transit test. Key findings The three compounds all had agonist properties at the 5-HT4 receptor but their efficacy differed in the different functional tests. Compound 3 had the highest affinity for the 5-HT4 receptor and was a full agonist at relaxing human colon circular muscle with efficacy closest to 5-HT. Compounds 1 and 2 were partial agonists in this assay with lower efficacies; compound 2 was a full agonist in the guinea-pig ileum assay whereas compound 3 was a partial agonist. Compounds 1 and 2 also showed activity in the mouse gut transit assay while compound 3 had no activity. Conclusions Of the compounds tested, compound 3 was the most promising 5-HT4 receptor agonist and the results highlight the value of using human tissue in functional tests when assessing compounds for potential activity.

Interaction of novel hybrid compounds with the D3 dopamine receptor: Site-directed mutagenesis and homology modeling studies	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Dopamine D3 receptor; Parkinson's disease; Hybrid dopamine agonists; 7-OH-DPAT; 5-OH-DPAT; Homology modeling	CONSERVED SERINE RESIDUES; PROTEIN COUPLED RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO ACTIVITY; BINDING-SITE; D-3; LIGANDS; POTENT; IDENTIFICATION; DISCOVERY; MULTIPLE	The dopamine D3 receptor has been implicated as a potential target for drug development in various complex psychiatric disorders including psychosis, drug dependence, and Parkinson's disease. In our overall goal to develop molecules with preferential affinity at D3 receptors, we undertook a hybrid drug development approach by combining a known dopamine agonist moiety with a substituted piperazine fragment. In the present study, three compounds produced this way with preferential D3 agonist activity, were tested at D3 receptors with mutations in the agonist binding pocket of three residues known to be important for agonist binding activity. At S192A and T369V, the hybrid agonist compounds produced an interaction profile in [H-3]spiperone binding assays similar to that of the parent 5-OH-DPAT and 7-OH-DPAT molecules. The loss of affinity at the S192A mutant was most prominent for 5-OH-DPAT and its corresponding hybrid compound D237. D110N did not show any radioligand binding. Homology modeling indicated that 7-OH-DPAT-derived D315 uniquely shares H-bonding with Tyr365 which produced favorable interaction and no loss of H-bonding in the S192A mutant, suggesting that agonist activity may not be solely controlled by residues in the binding pocket.

The four azetidinic amino acids were characterized in a radioligand binding assay ([H-3]CGP39653) at native NMDA receptors: L-trans-ADC showed the highest affinity (K-i = 10 mu m) followed by the D-cis-ADC stereoisomer (21 mu m). In contrast, the two analogues L-cis-ADC and D-trans-ADC were low-affinity ligands (> 100 and 90 mu m, respectively). Electrophysiological characterization of the ADC compounds at the four NMDA receptor subtypes NR1/NR2A, NR1/NR2B, NR1/NR2C, and NR1/NR2D expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed that L-trans-ADC displayed the highest agonist potency at NR1/NR2D (EC50=50 mu M), which was 9.4-, 3.4-, and 1.9-fold higher than the respective potencies at NR1/NR2A-C D-cis-ADC was shown to be a partial agonist at NR1/NR2C and NR1/NR2D with medium-range micromolar potencies (EC50=720 and 230 mu m, respectively).

As a part of our research program on new antipsychotics, we synthesized various derivatives of 1-cinnamyl-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazines, and evaluated their affinities for D2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and adrenergic (a,) receptors using radioligand-binding assays. In addition, we performed docking analysis using models for the D2 and 5-HT1A receptors. All compounds exhibited low to moderate affinity to 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, high affinity to the D2 receptor and large variability in affinities for the alpha(1) receptor. Docking analysis indicated that the binding to D2 and 5-HT1A receptors is based on (i) interaction between protonated N1 of the piperazine ring and various aspartate residues, (ii) hydrogen bonds between various moieties of the ligand and the residues of threonine, serine, histidine or tryptophane, and (iii) edge-to-face interactions of the aromatic ring of the arylpiperazine moiety with phenylalanine or tyrosine residues. Docking data for the D2 receptor can account for the binding properties obtained in binding assays, suggesting that the model is reliable and robust. However, docking data for the 5-HT1A receptor cannot account for actual binding properties, suggesting that further refinement of the model is required.

Opioid Receptors and Signaling on Cells from the Immune System	JOURNAL OF NEUROIMMUNE PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						opioid receptors; immune; chemokine receptors; selective opioids; receptor dimerization; mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors		This review discusses the criteria for determining whether a binding site or functional response is directly mediated by either the mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors. In 1988, Sibinga and Goldstein published the first review that addressed whether cells from the immune system express opioid receptors. The criteria that they used, namely, structure-activity relationships, stereoselectivity, dose- and concentration-dependence, and saturability are still relevant criteria today for determining if an immunological response is mediated by either the mu, delta or kappa opioid receptors. Radioligand receptor binding studies and functional studies that clearly show the presence of an opioid receptor on immunocytes are presented. Selective agonists and antagonists for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors are discussed, and the need for their use in experiments is emphasized. Conditions used in functional assays are very important. Receptor desensitization and downregulation occur within minutes after the application of an agonist. However, many immunological assays are applying an agonist for days before measuring an immunological effect. The results obtained may reflect changes that are results of receptor desensitization and/or downregulation instead of changes that are observed with acute activation of the receptor. The future of receptor pharmacology lies in the crosstalk and dimerization of G protein-coupled receptors. In transfected systems, opioid receptors have been shown to dimerize with chemokine and cannabinoid receptors, resulting in crosstalk between different types of receptors.

The aim of this study was to compare the distribution of histamine H-1 receptors between schizophrenics and normal human subjects in vivo using positron emission tomography (PET). H-1 receptor binding was measured in 10 normal subjects and 10 medicated schizophrenic patients by PET and [C-11] doxepin, a radioligand for the H-1 receptor. The binding potential (BP=Bmax/K-D) of [C-11] doxepin for available brain H-1 receptors was calculated by a graphical analysis on voxel-by-voxel basis and compared between schizophrenics and normal subjects using the regions of interest (ROIs) and the statistical parametrical mapping (SPM99). BP values for H, receptors in the frontal and prefrontal cortices and the cingulate gyrus were significantly lower among the schizophrenic patients than among the control subjects. On the contrary, there were no areas of the brain where H-1 receptors were significantly higher among the schizophrenic patients than the control subjects. The results of our study suggest that the central histaminergic neuron system could be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, although further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Opioid systems, which are closely linked with dopamine transmission, are thought to be affected by ethanol through alterations in the processing, release, and/or receptor binding of opioid peptides. We studied the effects of a single acute dose of ethanol on rat nigrostriatal mu opioid receptors by quantitative receptor autoradiography, using [H-3] [D-Ala(2), MePhe(4), Gly-ol(5)]-enkephalin ([H-3]-DAMGO) as radioligand. [H-3]-DAMGO binding was significantly decreased in the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra 1 hr after ethanol administration. Ethanol exposure did not affect [H-3]-DAMGO binding neither in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra nor in the caudate-putamen at any time tested after drug administration. The observed effects may reflect ethanol-induced changes in ligand binding affinity (Kd) or in receptor density (Bmax). Early and transitory ethanol-induced changes of mu receptors in the substantia nigra pars reticulata may be related to regulation of dopaminergic nigrostriatal transmission and contribute to determine brain sensitivity to the drug.

We investigated possible changes in glutamate receptor levels in neonatal animals following ethanol exposure using radioligand binding and western blot analysis. We used a vapor chamber to administer ethanol to neonatal Wistar rats 3 h a day from postnatal day (PND) 4-9. A separation control group was separated from their mothers for the same time and duration as the vapor treatment, while a normal control group was left to develop normally. Daily ethanol administrations resulted in decreased brain weight and body weight, as well as microencephaly (decreased brain:body weight ratio). Neither the affinity nor maximum binding of [H-3]MK-801 (dizoclipine maleate) in the cortex of PND10 rats differed between treatment groups. Western blot analysis also failed to reveal any changes in NMDAR1, NMDAR2A, or NMDAR2B receptor levels. In contrast, the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was greatly reduced in vapor-treated pups compared with control pups, as revealed by western blot analysis. A similar reduction was found in westerns with an antibody recognizing the GluR2 and 4 subunits. These results indicate that ethanol reduces AMPA rather than NMDA receptors in the developing neocortex, possibly by blocking NMDA receptors during development. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this study, we aimed to monitor in vivo regional changes of mGluR1 related to neuroinflammation in the brains of rats after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PISE) using longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET). PISE was induced in rats by administering lithium chloride, followed by repeated pilocarpine hydrochloride treatments. PET assessments were conducted using N-[4-[6-(isopropylamino)-pyrimidin-4-yl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]-N-methyl-4-[C-11] methylbenzamide ([C-11] ITDM), a selective radioligand for mGluR1, and N-benzyl-N-[C-11] methyl-2( 7-methyl-8-oxo-2-phenyl-7,8-dihydro-9H-purin-9-yl) acetamide ([C-11] DAC), a selective translocator protein PET ligand for neuroinflammation monitoring. PET scans were conducted on PISE rats at 1 day (acute), 1 week (subacute) and 3 weeks (chronic) after repeated seizures. PET with [C-11] ITDM showed significant decreases of mGluR1 availability (BPND) in the thalamus and hippocampus after PISE over the chronic period. Conversely, PET with [C-11] DAC exhibited a significant increase of radioactive uptake in the forebrain after the acute period, especially in the thalamus. These conflicting changes in the thalamus indicated negative correlation. In conclusion, PET with [C-11] ITDM could successfully visualize hippocampal and thalamic declines of mGluR1 related to neuroinflammation, which would help further understanding for mGluR1 functions in neuroexcitotoxicity.

SEP-39 is a potent (1.0 nM) inhibitor of human PDE10A in vitro, with good selectivity (>16000-fold) against other PDEs. In an in vivo occupancy study, the RO50 value was determined to be 0.7 mg/kg (p.o.), corresponding to plasma and brain exposures of 28 ng/mL and 43 ng/g, respectively. Using microdialysis, we show that 3 mg/kg (p.o.) SEP-39 significantly increased rat striatal cGMP concentrations. Furthermore, SEP-39 inhibits PCP-induced hyperlocomotion at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg (p.o.) corresponding to 59-86% occupancy. At similar doses in a catalepsy study, the time on the bar was increased but the maximal effect was less than that seen with haloperidol. In an EEG study, 3 and 10 mg/kg (p.o.) SEP-39 suppressed REM intensity and increased the latency to REM sleep. We also demonstrate the procognitive effects of SEP-39 in the rat novel object recognition assay. These effects appear to require less PDE10A inhibition than the reversal of PCP-induced hyperlocomotion or EEG effects, as improvements in recognition index were seen at doses of 03 mg/kg and above. Our data demonstrate that SEP-39 is a potent, orally active PDE10A inhibitor with therapeutic potential in a number of psychiatric indications. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The objectives of the present study were to evaluate kinetic analysis methods, determine test-retest reliability, and assess gender differences in receptor availability. Dynamic PET data were acquired in 10 human subjects, and analyzed with one-tissue (1T) and two-tissue (2T) compartment models and by the Logan and multilinear analysis (MA1) methods to estimate regional volume of distribution (V-T). The 2T model inclusive of a vascular component (2T(V)) and MA1 were the preferred techniques. Test-retest reliability of V-T was good (mean absolute deviation similar to 9%; intraclass correlation coefficient similar to 0.7). Tracer parent fraction in plasma was lower in women (P<0.0001). Cerebral uptake normalized by body weight and injected dose was higher in men by 17% (P<0.0001), but V-T was significantly greater in women by 23% (P<0.0001). These findings show that [C-11]OMAR binding can be reliably quantified by the 2T model or MA1 method and demonstrate the utility of this tracer for in vivo imaging of CB1R. In addition, results from the present study indicate that gender difference in receptor binding should be taken into consideration when [C-11]OMAR is used to quantify CB1R availability in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Cerebral 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor binding, but not mGluR2, is increased in tryptophan hydroxylase 2 decrease-of-function mice	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Serotonin; Receptor; Autoradiography; Tiyptophan hydroxylase; Frontal cortex; Rat	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SUICIDE VICTIMS; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; DEPRESSION; BRAIN; RAT; ACTIVATION; PAROXETINE	Transgenic mice with a knock-in (KI) of a tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (Tph2) R439H mutation, analogous to the Tph2 R441H single-nucleotide polymorphism originally identified in a late life depression cohort, have markedly reduced levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). These Tph2KI mice are therefore interesting as a putative translational model of low endogenous 5-HT function that allows for assessment of adaptive changes in different anatomical regions. Here, we determined 5-HT2A receptor binding in several brain regions using in vitro receptor autoradiography and two different radioligands. When using the 5-HT2A receptor selective antagonist radioligand H-3-MDL100907, we found higher binding in the prefrontal cortex (10%, P = 0.009), the striatum (26%, P = 0.005), and the substantia nigra (21%, P = 0.027). The increase was confirmed in the same regions with the 5-HT2A/c receptor agonist, H-3-CIMBI-36 (2-(4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-methoxybenzyl)ethanamine). 5-HT2A receptors establish heteromeric receptor complexes with metabotropic glutamate 2 receptors (mGluR2), but binding levels of the mGluR2/3 ligand H-3-LY341495 were unaltered in brain areas with increased 5-HT2A receptor levels. These data show that in distinct anatomical regions, 5-HT2A receptor binding sites are up-regulated in 5-HT deficient mice, and this increase is not associated with changes in mGluR2 binding.

However, approximately one-third of epilepsy patients still suffer from uncontrolled seizures. Effective treatments for epilepsy are yet to be developed. N-6-(3-methoxyl-4-hydroxybenzyl) adenine riboside (B2) is a N-6-substitued adenosine analog. Here we describe an investigation of the effects and mechanisms of B2 on chemical convulsant-induced seizures. Seizures were induced in mice by administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), picrotoxin, kainite acid (KA), or strychnine. B2 has a dose-related anticonvulsant effect in these chemical-induced seizure models. The protective effects of B2 include increased latency of seizure onset, decreased seizure occurrence, shorter seizure duration and reduced mortality rate. Radioligand binding and cAMP accumulation assays indicated that B2 might be a functional ligand for both adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors. Furthermore, DPCPX, a selective A(1) receptor antagonist, but not SCH58261, a selective A(2A) receptor antagonist, blocked the anticonvulsant effect of B2 on PTZ-induced seizure. c-Fos is a cellular marker for neuronal activity. Immunohistochemical and western blot analyses indicated that B2 significantly reversed PTZ-induced c-Fos expression in the hippocampus. Together, these results indicate that B2 has significant anticonvulsant effects. The anticonvulsant effects of B2 may be attributed to adenosine A(1) receptor activation and reduced neuronal excitability in the hippocampus. These observations also support that the use of adenosine receptor agonist may be a promising approach for the treatment of epilepsy.

We investigated both serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 drug-naive dogs with compulsive behaviour, as a potential model for human OCD. Single photon emission computed tomography was used with I-123-R91150 and I-123-FP-CIT, in combination with Tc-99m-ECD brain perfusion co-registration, to measure the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor, dopamine transporter (DAT) and serotonin transporter (SERT) availability. Fifteen normally behaving dogs were used as reference group. Significantly lower 5-HT2A receptor radioligand availability in frontal and temporal cortices (bilateral) was observed. Further, in 78% of the compulsive dogs abnormal DAT ratios in left and right striatum were demonstrated. Interestingly, both increased and decreased DAT ratios were observed. Finally, significantly lower subcortical perfusion and (hypo) thalamic SERF availability were observed in the compulsive dogs. This study provides evidence for imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in the pathophysiology of compulsions in dogs. The similarities with the altered neurotransmission in human OCD provide construct validity for this non-induced, natural canine model, suggesting its usefulness for future investigations of the pathophysiology of human OCD as well as the effectiveness of psychopharmacological interventions.

Decreased dopamine type 2 receptor availability after bariatric surgery: Preliminary findings	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Dopamine; Obesity; Bariatric surgery; Receptor	LAPAROSCOPIC SLEEVE GASTRECTOMY; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MORBIDLY OBESE SUBJECTS; GASTRIC BYPASS-SURGERY; EXTRASTRIATAL REGIONS; F-18 FALLYPRIDE; DORSAL STRIATUM; FOOD REWARD; WEIGHT-LOSS; PEPTIDE-YY	Background: Diminished dopaminergic neurotransmission contributes to decreased reward and negative eating behaviors in obesity. Bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for obesity and rapidly reduces hunger and improves satiety through unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized that dopaminergic neurotransmission would be enhanced after Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass (RYGB) and Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy (VSG) surgery and that these changes would influence eating behaviors and contribute to the positive outcomes from bariatric surgery. Methods: Five females with obesity were studied preoperatively and at 7 weeks after RYGB or VSG surgery. Subjects underwent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with a dopamine type 2 (DA D2) receptor radioligand whose binding is sensitive to competition with endogenous dopamine. Regions of interest (ROI) relevant to eating behaviors were delineated. Fasting enteroendocrine hormones were quantified at each time point. Results: Body weight decreased as expected after surgery. DA D2 receptor availability decreased after surgery. Regional decreases (mean +/- SEM) were caudate 10 +/- 3%, putamen 9 +/- 4%, ventral striatum 8 +/- 4%, hypothalamus 9 +/- 3%, substantia nigra 10 +/- 2%, medial thalamus 8 2%, and amygdala 9 3%. These were accompanied by significant decreases in plasma insulin (62%) and leptin (41%). Conclusion: The decreases in DA D2 receptor availability after RYGB and VSG most likely reflect increases in extracellular dopamine levels. Enhanced dopaminergic neurotransmission may contribute to improved eating behavior (e.g. reduced hunger and improved satiety) following these bariatric procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Kappa opioid mediation of cannabinoid effects of the potent hallucinogen, salvinorin A, in rodents	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Cannabinoid; JDTic; Kappa-opioid agonist; Kappa-opioid antagonist; Rimonabant; Salvia divinorum; Salvinorin A	PLANT-DERIVED HALLUCINOGEN; SALVIA-DIVINORUM; RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; PHARMACOLOGICAL-PROPERTIES; CB1 RECEPTOR; AGONIST; RATS; MICE; DISCRIMINATION; MODULATION	Salvinorin A, the primary psychoactive derivative of the hallucinogenic herb Salvia divinorum, is a potent and highly selective kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist. Several recent studies, however, have suggested endocannabinoid system mediation of some of its effects. This study represents a systematic examination of this hypothesis. Salvinorin A was isolated from S. divinorum and was evaluated in a battery of in vitro and in vivo procedures designed to detect cannabinoid activity, including CB(1) receptor radioligand and [(35)S]GTP gamma S binding, calcium flux assay, in vivo cannabinoid screening tests, and drug discrimination. Salvinorin A did not bind to nor activate CB(1) receptors. In vivo salvinorin A produced pronounced hypolocomotion and antinociception (and to a lesser extent, hypothermia). These effects were blocked by the selective KOR antagonist, JDTic, but not by the CB(1) receptor antagonist rimonabant. Interestingly, however, rimonabant attenuated KOR activation stimulated by U69,593 in a [(35)S]GTP gamma S assay. Salvinorin A did not substitute for Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in mice trained to discriminate THC. These findings suggest that similarities in the pharmacological effects of salvinorin A and those of cannabinoids are mediated by its activation of KOR rather than by any direct action of salvinorin A on the endocannabinoid system. Further, the results suggest that rimonabant reversal of salvinorin A effects in previous studies may be explained in part by rimonabant attenuation of KOR activation.

The reproducibility and reliability of [C-11]PE2I measurements, especially in the small DAT-rich brain regions, is unknown and of critical importance to the interpretation of the data. Five healthy volunteers were scanned twice during the same day using [C-11]PE2I and the HRRT PET scanner. Methods based on metabolite-corrected arterial plasma curve and reference region were used to estimate distribution volumes (VT) and binding potential (BP). Within-subject and between-subject variabilities were compared. [C-11]PE2I accumulated in the DAT-rich striatum and the midbrain. Equilibrium of specific binding appeared late in the striatum, whereas it was reached earlier in the midbrain. Plasma metabolite analysis showed that the potentially brain-penetrant 4-hydroxymethyl metabolite represented 15% to 20% of total plasma radioactivity. VT and BP measurements were associated with low within-subject variability. Measurement of DAT binding in small brain regions, including the substantia nigra, is reproducible and reliable using [11C]PE2I and high-resolution research tomograph. A scanning time of more than 70 mins is required for the striatum, while less is sufficient for DAT quantification in the midbrain. The previously suggested involvement of the potentially brain-penetrant radioactive metabolite in the quantification should be further studied.

However, the extent to which dopamine increases reflect a primary rather than a secondary response to the cues remains unclear. Here we evaluated the extent to which dopamine increases by themselves can induce craving in cocaine abusers. Using PET and [C-11]raclopride (D2 receptor radioligand sensitive to competition with endogenous dopamine) we show that in cocaine abusers (n=20) oral methylphenidate (20 mg), which significantly increased dopamine in striatum, did not induce craving unless subjects were concomitantly exposed to cocaine cues (video scenes of subjects self-administering cocaine). This suggests that dopamine increases associated with conditioned cues are not primary responses but reflect downstream stimulation of dopamine cells (presumably glutamatergic afferents from prefrontal cortex and/or amygdala). Inasmuch as afferent stimulation of dopamine neurons results in phasic cell firing these findings suggest that "fast" dopamine increases, in contrast to the "slow" dopamine increases as achieved when using oral methylphenidate (mimicking tonic dopamine cell firing), are required for cues to trigger craving. The fact that methylphenidate induced craving only when given with the cocaine cues highlights the context dependency of methylphenidate's effects and suggests that its use for the treatment of ADHD subjects with co-morbid drug abuse should not increase craving.

Methods A group of 33 Chinese patients with newly diagnosed Type 1B diabetes, were identified by the absence of autoantibodies to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), IA-2, insulin, thyroid globulin or thyroid peroxidase, or high-risk HLA-DQ haplotypes. The cohort was further characterized by measurement of autoantibodies to carboxypeptidase H (CPH) and SOX13 using radioligand assays, and testing for genetic mutations associated with MODY3/MODY6 and mitochondrial diabetes. Mutations of HNF-1 alpha (MODY3) and neuroD1/beta 2 (MODY6) genes were screened using the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique and sequencing. Mitochondrial DNA mutations were analysed with polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Results Within the cohort, we found one patient with a novel mutation, R321H (CGC -> CAC) in exon 5 of the HNF-1 alpha gene, one with ND1 mt3316 G -> A mutation in mitochondrial DNA, five with Ala45Thr polymorphisms in the neuroD1/beta 2 gene, and two patients with autoantibodies to SOX13. Conclusions Some of the Chinese patients originally thought to have Type 1B diabetes do have other evidence of islet autoimmunity and genetic mutations involved in the underlying aetiology. This suggests that more rigorous screening for these conditions is needed before classifying subjects as having Type 1B diabetes.

Radiosyntheses were accomplished by the reaction of fluorine-18-labeled intermediate with 8-methoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrochromeno[3,4-c]pyridin-5-one (1) followed by HPLC purification. The overall radiochemical yield of the radiosynthesis was 19.5% (decay corrected), the specific radioactivity was about 110GBq/mu mol and the radiochemical purity was greater than 99%, the time of synthesis and purification was approximately I 10 min. Tissue distribution studies of the [F-18]FMTP in rats showed that the radioactivity in the brain was concentrated in frontal cortex and medulla, the region that has a high density of D-4 receptors. Pre-treatment with nonradioactive FMTP (1.0mg/kg) produced a significant reduction of radioactivity in all the regions. About 40% of total radioactivity in plasma and 100% in rat brain extract represented unchanged radioligand at 60min after injection as determined by HPLC. These results indicate that [F-18]FMTP have some specific binding to the D-4 receptor. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Oxazolo[2,3-f]purinediones were synthesized by cyclization of 8-bromotheophylline with oxiranes. The obtained compounds (1-22) were evaluated for their affinity at adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors. They showed mainly adenosine A(2A) receptor affinity at low micromolar concentrations and A(2A) selectivity, for example, compound 9 with an octyl substituent at the oxazole ring displayed adenosine A(2A) receptor affinity (K-i=0.998muM) and at least 25-fold A(2A) versus A(1) selectivity. This compound was less selective (5-fold) towards human recombinant A(2B) and A(3) adenosine receptors. In this group of compounds active adenosine A, receptor antagonists were also identified. Oxazolopurinediones were evaluated in vivo as anticonvulsants in MES and ScMet tests and examined for neurotoxicity in mice (ip). Compounds with long alkyl chains showed anticonvulsant activity in both tests (in 100 and 300mg/kg doses), accompanied by significant neurotoxicity. The anticonvulsant activity in rats (po) was higher and without signs of neurotoxicity. SAR and QSAR studies stressed the importance of lipophilic 7-substituents for both types of pharmacological activity. The volume of the substituent is, however, limited at the A(2A) AR, an n-octyl group being optimal. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here we describe the distribution of A(1)ARs in the living human brain with PET, made possible for the first time by the highly potent and selective A(1)AR antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-3-(3-[F-18]fluoropropyl)-1-propylxanthine ([F-18]CPFPX). In vivo data demonstrate a rapid cerebral uptake, peaking at 2.9 +/- 0.6% injected dose/liter at 3.3 +/- 1.3 min, followed by a gradual washout. Consistent with the results of autoradiography, high receptor densities occurred in the putamen and the mediodorsal thalamus. Neocortical regions showed regional differences in [F-18]CPFPX binding, with high accumulation in temporal > occipital > parietal > frontal lobes and a lower level of binding in the sensorimotor cortex. Ligand accumulation was low in cerebellum, midbrain, and brain stem. Metabolism of [18 F]CPFPX is rapid outside the central nervous system, but the metabolites do not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In conclusion, in vivo application of [F-18]CPFPX, a highly potent and selective PET ligand, for the first time allows the imaging of A(1)ARs in the living human brain.

We investigated the suitability of DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid! as a replacement for the widely used diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, to enable stable labeling of somatostatin analogs with both therapeutic (Y-90) and diagnostic (In-111) radionuclides. The three clinically relevant somatostatin agonists, octreotide, vapreotide, and lanreotide, together with the newly designed Tyr(3)-octreotide (TyrOc), were conjugated to DOTA and labeled with Y-90 or In-111. For all DOTA-somatostatin analogs tested, irrespective of the incorporated radionuclide, we observed favorable biodistribution profiles in AR4-2J tumor-bearing mice: 1) a rapid clearance from all SSTR-negative tissues except kidney; 2) a specific uptake in SSTR-positive tissues, including tumor; and 3) an excellent tumor penetration. The main route of excretion was via the kidneys. Nevertheless, DOTATOC was clearly superior to the other DOTA-somatostatin analogs tested, as well as OctreoScan, as indicated by the highest tumor-to-nontarget-tissue ratio, including the tumor-to-SSTR-positive-tissue ratios. The presence of different SSTR subtypes in the SSTR-positive tissues possibly contributes to these differential uptakes. We assume that the very favorable behavior of DOTATOC in our mouse model makes this radioligand very promising for future applications in nuclear oncology.

Vascular effects of midazolam, flumazenil, and a novel imidazobenzodiazepine MP-III-058 on isolated rat aorta	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						vascular GABAA receptors; midazolam; flumazenil; MP-III-058; vasoactivity; rat thoracic aorta	GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; GABA-A RECEPTORS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ARTERIES; SUBTYPES; ENDOTHELIUM; DIAZEPAM; VASODILATION	Hypotensive influences of benzodiazepines and other GABAA receptor ligands, recognized in clinical practice, seem to stem from the existence of "vascular" GABAA receptors in peripheral blood vessels, besides any mechanisms in the central and peripheral nervous systems. We aimed to further elucidate the vasodilatatory effects of ligands acting through GABAA receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, the rat aortic smooth muscle layer was found to express GABAA gamma 2 and alpha 1-5 subunit proteins. To confirm the role of "vascular" GABAA receptors, we investigated the vascular effects of standard benzodiazepines, midazolam, and flumazenil, as well as the novel compound MP-III-058. Using two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology and radioligand binding assays, MP-III-058 was found to have modest binding but substantial functional selectivity for alpha 5,83 gamma 2 over other alpha x,83 gamma 2 GABAA receptors. Tissue bath assays revealed comparable vasodilatory effects of MP-III-058 and midazolam, both of which at 100 mu mol/L concentrations had efficacy similar to prazosin. Flumazenil exhibited weak vasoactivity per se, but significantly prevented the relaxant effects of midazolam and MP-III-058. These studies indicate the existence of functional GABAA receptors in the rat aorta, where ligands exert vasodilatory effects by positive modulation of the benzodiazepine binding site, suggesting the potential for further quest for leads with optimized pharmacokinetic properties as prospective adjuvant vasodilators.

Benzimidazolone-based selective σ<sub>2</sub> receptor ligands: Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Sigma receptors; Sigma-2 receptors; Sigma-2 ligands; Benzimidazolone; Structure-affinity relationships; Cocaine-induced convulsions; Cocaine's toxicity	MOLECULAR-CLONING; COCAINE; BINDING; SN79; METHAMPHETAMINE; EXPRESSION; STIMULANT; AGONISTS; DISEASE; ANALOGS	Sigma receptors (sigma Rs) are considered to be a significant and valid target for developing new medications to address several diseases. Their potential involvement in numerous central nervous system disorders, neuropathic pain, addiction, and cancer has been extensively reported. In particular, the sigma R-2 has been identified as potential target for the development of pharmaceutical agents intended to treat the negative effects associated with drugs of abuse. As a continuation of our previous efforts to develop new selective sigma R-2 ligands, a series of benzimidazolone derivatives were designed, synthesized, and characterized. The newly synthesized ligands were evaluated through in vitro radioligand binding assays to determine their affinity and selectivity towards both sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors. Several derivatives displayed high affinity for the sigma R-2 (K-i = 0.66-68.5 nM) and varied from preferring to selective, compared to sigma R-1 (sigma(1)/sigma(2) = 5.8-1139). Among them, compound 1-{4-[4-(4-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-3-propyl-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one dihydrochloride (14) displayed the ability to produce a dose-dependent reduction in the convulsive effects of cocaine in a rodent model after injecting 10 mg/kg (i.p.). These preliminary results support the use of selective sigma R-2 ligands in the development of useful pharmacological tools or potential pharmacotherapies for cocaine toxicity.

Methods We quantified the cerebral binding potential (BPND) of the A(1)AR in carriers of the HD CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion using the radioligand [F-18] CPFPX and PET. Four groups were investigated: (i) premanifest individuals far (preHD-A; n = 7) or (ii) near (preHD-B; n = 6) to the predicted symptom onset, (iii) manifest HD patients (n = 8), and (iv) controls (n = 36). Results Cerebral A(1)AR values of preHD-A subjects were generally higher than those of controls (by up to 31 %, p<.01, in the thalamus on average). Across stages a successive reduction of A(1)AR BPND was observed to the levels of controls in preHD-B and undercutting controls in manifest HD by down to 25 %, p<.01, in the caudatus and amygdala. There was a strong correlation between A(1)AR BPND and years to onset. Before onset of HD, the assumed annual rates of change of A(1)AR density were -1.2 % in the caudatus, -1.7 % in the thalamus and -3.4 % in the amygdala, while the corresponding volume losses amounted to 0.6 %, 0.1 % and 0.2 %, respectively. Conclusions Adenosine receptors switch from supra to subnormal levels during phenoconversion of HD. This differential regulation may play a role in the pathophysiology of altered energy metabolism.

Therefore in this study, for the first time we investigated the direct binding affinity of KYNA and its structural analog KYNA-1 towards mu, kappa and delta opioid receptor in competition binding experiments applying opioid receptor specific radioligands. The binding affinity measurements were performed in Chinese hamster ovary cell lines overexpressing the corresponding opioid receptor (mu and kappa opioid receptor were rat, delta opioid receptor were mouse sequence). Additionally we also examined the chronic effect of these compounds on mu, kappa and delta opioid receptor and also nociceptin peptide receptor mediated G-protein activity in [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays performed in mouse cortex and striatum membranes. Our results showed that KYNA and KYNA-1 had no affinity towards any of the three classic opioid receptors. On the other hand the compounds significantly decreased opioid and nociceptin receptor mediated G-protein activity or in some cases enhanced the potency of the activating ligand. Moreover, the alterations were receptor and brain region specific. Accordingly, we conclude that KYNA and KYNA-1 do not interact directly with the opioid receptors, but more likely alter the receptor functions intracellularly.

Commercially Available Angiotensin II At<sub>2</sub> Receptor Antibodies Are Nonspecific	PLOS ONE			English	Article							TYPE-2 AT(2) RECEPTOR; MESSENGER-RNA; CONVERTING-ENZYME; BIOCHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; AT(1) RECEPTORS; ADRENAL-GLAND; RAT-BRAIN; EXPRESSION; SUBTYPES; SPECIFICITY	Commercially available angiotensin II AT(2) receptor antibodies are widely employed for receptor localization and quantification, but they have not been adequately validated. In this study, we characterized three commercially available AT(2) receptor antibodies: 2818-1 from Epitomics, sc-9040 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and AAR-012 from Alomone Labs. Using western blot analysis the immunostaining patterns observed were different for every antibody tested, and in most cases consisted of multiple immunoreactive bands. Identical immunoreactive patterns were present in wild-type and AT(2) receptor knockout mice not expressing the target protein. In the mouse brain, immunocytochemical studies revealed very different cellular immunoreactivity for each antibody tested. While the 2818-1 antibody reacted only with endothelial cells in small parenchymal arteries, the sc-9040 antibody reacted only with ependymal cells lining the cerebral ventricles, and the AAR-012 antibody reacted only with multiple neuronal cell bodies in the cerebral cortex. Moreover, the immunoreactivities were identical in brain tissue from wildtype or AT(2) receptor knockout mice. Furthermore, in both mice and rat tissue extracts, there was no correlation between the observed immunoreactivity and the presence or absence of AT(2) receptor binding or gene expression. We conclude that none of these commercially available AT(2) receptor antibodies tested met the criteria for specificity. In the absence of full antibody characterization, competitive radioligand binding and determination of mRNA expression remain the only reliable approaches to study AT(2) receptor expression.

Increased In Vivo Expression of an Inflammatory Marker in Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						positron emission tomography; translocator protein 18 kDa; epilepsy; inflammation	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PROTEIN 18 KDA; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; HUMAN BRAIN; HIPPOCAMPAL SCLEROSIS; PET; ENCEPHALITIS; ASSOCIATION; MICROGLIA	Animal studies and clinical observations suggest that epilepsy is associated with inflammation. Translocator protein (TSPO) (18 kDa), a marker of inflammation, is increased in vitro in surgical samples from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. TSPO can be measured in the living human brain with PET and the novel radioligand C-11-PBR28. In this study, we sought to determine whether in vivo expression of TSPO is increased ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy. Methods: Sixteen patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy and 30 healthy subjects were studied with C-11-PBR28 PET and MRI. Uptake of radioactivity after injection of C-11-PBR28 was measured from regions of interest drawn bilaterally onto MR images. Brain uptake from ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres was compared using a paired-samples t test. Results: We found that brain uptake was higher ipsilateral to the seizure focus in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, amygdala, fusiform gyrus, and choroid plexus but not in other brain regions. This asymmetry was more pronounced in patients with hippocampal sclerosis than in those without. Conclusion: We found increased uptake of radioactivity after injection of C-11-PBR28 ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy, suggesting increased expression of TSPO. Studies in larger samples are required to confirm this finding and determine the clinical utility of imaging TSPO in temporal lobe epilepsy.

Starting from the enantiopure bicyclic ketones 3 and ent-3 bridged piperazines with different residues in position 6 were synthesized. The N-6 allyl protective group was removed by a RhCl3 catalyzed double bond isomerization and subsequent hydrolysis of the resulting enamide 8. After acetalization the secondary amide 10 was alkylated and arylated. Structure affinity relationships show that a relatively large substituent, which has not necessarily to be an aromatic one, is required in position 6 for high sigma(1) receptor affinity (e. g., 12 and ent-12 with a dimethylallyl residue: K-i = 20 nM and 17 nM). Furthermore, it was shown that substituents that reduce the basicity of N-6 led to a severe decrease in sigma(1) affinity. Growth inhibition experiments with six human tumor cell lines revealed that the allyl and benzyl substituted 6,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.2] nonan-2-one derivatives 5, ent-5 and ent-14 are able to selectively inhibit the growth of the bladder cancer cell line 5637.

[F-18]altanserin studies were conducted in seven subjects using the bolus/infusion approach designed for attaining steady state in blood and brain 2 hours after the initial [F-18]altanserin administration. Three hours after commencement of radiotracer administration, 0.25 mg/kg of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, citalopram (Lundbeck, Valby, Denmark), was administered to all subjects as a constant infusion for 20 minutes. To reduce 5-HT1A-mediated autoinhibition of cortical 5-HT release, four of the seven subjects were pretreated with the partial 5-HT1A agonist pindolol for 3 days at an increasing oral dose (25 mg on the day of scanning). In each subject, the baseline condition (120 to 180 minutes) was compared with the stimulated condition (195 to 300 minutes). Despite a pronounced increase in plasma prolactin and two subjects reporting hot flushes compatible with an 5-HT-induced adverse effect, cortical [F-18]altanserin binding was insensitive to the citalopram challenge, even after pindolol pretreatment. The biochemical and cellular events possibly affecting the unsuccessful translation of the citalopram/pindolol challenge into a change in 5-HT2A receptor binding of [F-18]altanserin are discussed.

The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has, however, not been thoroughly examined in terms of this complex structure, which has connections with most brain regions of central interest in schizophrenia research. The aim of the present study was to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. Method: The authors used positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]FLB457 to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in thalamic subregions of 10 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia. Binding potential was calculated by the reference tissue method and used as an index for dopamine D-2 receptor binding. Comparisons were made with 19 healthy subjects. Subregions of interest were de-fined on individual magnetic resonance images using a percentage-based operational approach. Clinical symptoms were rated by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: The [C-11]FLB457 binding potential was lower in the central medial and posterior subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. At a functional level, there was a significant negative correlation between binding potential and BPRS positive symptom scores. Conclusions: The subregions with low D-2 receptor binding comprise primarily the dorsomedial nucleus and pulvinar, two important components in circuitries previously suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Aberrant dopaminergic neurotransmission in thalamic subregions might be a mechanism underlying positive symptoms in schizophrenia.

The modeling studies have investigated the conformational and electrostatic properties of the ligands. Superposition of active molecules gave the coordinates of the hypothetical 5-point sigma1 pharmacophore, as follows: R1 (0.85, 7.26, 0.30); R2 (5.47, 2.40, -1.51); R3 (-2.57, 4.82, -7.10); N (-0.71, 3.29, -6.40); carbon centroid (3.16, 4.83, -0.60), where R1, R2 were constructed onto the aromatic ring of each compound to represent hydrophobic interactions with the receptor; and R3 represents a hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom and the receptor. Additional analyses were used to describe secondary binding sites to electronegative groups such as oxygen or sulfur atom. Those coordinates are (2.34, 5.08, -4.18). The model was verified by fitting other sigma1 receptor ligands. This model may be used to search conformational databases for other possibly active ligands. In conjunction with rational drug design techniques the model may be useful in design and synthesis of novel sigma1 ligands of high selectivity and potency.

Many studies report detectable levels of autoantibodies to myelin basic protein though other studies, using similar techniques, report their absence. We compared a solution-phase assay that has detected clinically relevant autoantibodies in diabetes and other autoimmune diseases to solid phase assays similar to those used in previous reports. The solution-phase assay consistently measured autoantibodies to MBP in serum from human subjects with Semple rabies vaccine (SRV)-induced demyelinating disease and from MBP-immunized animals. A solid phase assay detected MBP autoantibodies in the serum of a fraction of patients with MS. Autoantibodies capable of binding to MBP in the solution-phase were not detected in the CSF or serum of patients with MS. Additional solution-phase measurements revealed that anti-MBP antibodies from individuals with SRV-induced demyelinating disease demonstrated a binding affinity profile consistent with that of polyclonal antibodies with a range of affinities from low to high. In contrast, antibodies to MBP in the serum of MS patients detected by ELISA did not bind soluble MBP in the same assay. These results indicate that the Immoral response in patients with MS does not include moderate- or high-affinity autoantibodies to MBP. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Among its hypothesized functions, the regulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and apoptosis have been suggested; in addition alterations of PBR site density have been shown in some neuropathologic conditions with putative mitochondrial involvement. The aim of this work has been to evaluate PBR kinetic binding parameters in platelets from patients affected by mitochondrial disorders (MD) with large-scale mitochondrial DNA deletions and reduced cytochrome c oxidase activity. Materials and Methods: Using the specific PBR radioligand [H-3] PK 11195, the kinetic binding parameters of PBR sites were determined in platelet membrane of 15 healthy subjects and 11 patients affected by different form of MD. Results: Significant changes of dissociation constant (K-d) and maximal number of binding sites (B-max) values were evidenced in platelets of patients versus controls. in all patients the B-max values were decreased (2387.0 +/- 305.6 fmol/mg proteins versus 4889.0 +/- 357.8 fmol/mg proteins, p < 0.05), whereas the K-d values were higher in patients than controls (13.18 +/- 2.06 nM versus 5.63 +/- 0.46 nM, p < 0.05). Conclusions: These data suggest that the kinetic binding parameters of PBR are altered in MD and that the observed changes might be related to the mitochondrial dysfunction associated with MD.

J	Harkness, PC; Millar, NS				Harkness, PC; Millar, NS			Inefficient cell-surface expression of hybrid complexes formed by the co-assembly of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and serotonin receptor subunits	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						acetylcholine receptor; nicotinic receptor; serotonin receptor; subunit assembly	ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN RECEPTORS; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; HETEROLOGOUS EXPRESSION; STABLE EXPRESSION; MOLECULAR-CLONING; 5-HT3 RECEPTORS; BRAIN; SUBTYPES; BINDING	Previous studies have demonstrated that relatively low levels of alpha4 beta2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are expressed on the cell surface of transfected mammalian cell lines but that surface expression levels can be dramatically up-regulated by co-expression of these subunits with chimeric subunits containing the N-terminal portion of the neuronal nAChR alpha4 or beta2 subunits together with the C-terminal domain of the 5-HT3A subunit. Recent work has also suggested that the nAChR alpha4 subunit can co-assemble in a 'promiscuous' manner with the serotonin receptor 5-HT3A subunit to form functional hybrid receptors. In this study we have examined whether co-assembly of either alpha4 or beta2 with 5-HT3A itself (rather than with the alpha4/5-HT3A or beta2/5-HT3A subunit chimeras) can also facilitate cell surface expression of alpha4 and beta2 subunits in transfected mammalian cells. Evidence has been obtained by immunoprecipitation, cell-surface antibody binding and radioligand binding which indicates that the 5-HT3A can co-assemble with both the alpha4 and beta2 nAChR subunits. We conclude, however, that co-assembly of 5-HT3A with either alpha4 or beta2 does not result in efficient cell surface expression of the nAChR subunits and that co-assembled hybrid (nAChR subunit + 5-HT3R subunit) receptor complexes are largely retained within the cell.

J	Acosta, JJ; San Román, JI; López, MA; Calvo, JJ				Acosta, JJ; San Román, JI; López, MA; Calvo, JJ			Influence of chronic ethanol consumption on the muscarinic cholinergic control of rat pancreatic acinar cells	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						ethanol; muscarinic receptors; pancreatic acini; amylase secretion; rat	DIETARY FIBER; INDIGESTIBLE POLYSACCHARIDES; EXOCRINE SECRETION; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; ANIMAL-MODELS; RECEPTORS; BINDING; CHOLECYSTOKININ; INGESTION; INCREASES	There are a number of hypothetical explanations for the actions of ethanol on the exocrine pancreas; among them, the cholinergic hypothesis has received special attention. According to this hypothesis, chronic alcohol consumption induces alterations in the control of exocrine pancreatic function resulting in cholinergic hyperstimulation of pancreatic acinar cells and their muscarinic receptors. Our aim was to investigate the cholinergic control of pancreatic enzyme secretion and the number and affinity of muscarinic receptors in the pancreatic acinar cells of rats subjected to chronic ethanol ingestion. We also investigated whether a high-fibre diet modifies the actions of ethanol on these aspects of the exocrine pancreatic function. Four groups of rats received either a standard or a high fibre diet, and either water or 20 % (v/v) ethanol. After 6 months of treatment, isolated pancreatic acini were used for the determination of carbachol-stimulated amylase secretion and for the analysis of muscarinic receptors, using 1-[N-methyl-H-3]scopolamine as a radioligand. Neither chronic ethanol intake nor a high fibre diet caused any apparent, alteration in pancreatic histology, neither did them modify plasmatic amylase levels. Chronic alcoholization resulted in a significant increase in the amylase released from pancreatic acini in response to carbachol stimulation, but it did not affect either the number or the affinity of pancreatic acinar muscarinic receptors. The actions of ethanol are not significantly modified by the simultaneous consumption of a high fibre diet.

However. because SPs are extracellular deposits of amyloid-beta peptides (A beta), it may be possible to eventually develop radioligands that cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and label SPs so they can be visualized by current imaging methods. As a first step toward the generation of such a radioligand, we developed a probe, [(trans,trans)-1-bromo-2,5-bis-(3-hydroxycarbonyl-4-hydroxy)styrylbenzene(BSB)], and we report here that BSB has the following properties essential for a probe that can detect SPs in vivo, First, BSB sensitively labels SPs in AD brain sections. Second. BSB permeates living cells in culture and binds specifically to intracellular A beta aggregates. Third, after intracerebral injection in living transgenic mouse models of AD amyloidosis. BSB labels SPs composed of human A beta with high sensitivity and specificity. fourth, BSB crosses the BBB and labels numerous AD-like SPs throughout the brain of the transgenic mice after i.v. injection. Thus, we conclude that BSB is an appropriate starting point for future efforts to generate an antemortem diagnostic for AD.

Ketamine and Ceftriaxone-Induced Alterations in Glutamate Levels Do Not Impact the Specific Binding of Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Subtype 5 Radioligand [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PSS232 in the Rat Brain	PHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						glutamate; metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5; [F-18]PSS232; ketamine; ceftriaxone; positron emission tomography; allosteric modulator; MMPEP; ABP688	PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE; MGLUR5; RADIOSYNTHESIS; C-11-ABP688; ACTIVATION; CHALLENGE; BLOCKADE	Several studies showed that [C-11]ABP688 binding is altered following drug-induced perturbation of glutamate levels in brains of humans, non-human primates and rats. We evaluated whether the fluorinated derivative [F-18]PSS232 can be used to assess metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) availability in rats after pharmacological challenge with ketamine, known to increase glutamate, or ceftriaxone, known to decrease glutamate. In vitro autoradiography was performed on rat brain slices with [F-18]PSS232 to prove direct competition of the drugs for mGluR5. One group of rats were challenged with a bolus injection of either vehicle, racemic ketamine, S-ketamine or ceftriaxone followed by positron emission tomography PET imaging with [F-18]PSS232. The other group received an infusion of the drugs during the PET scan. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were calculated using a reference tissue model. In vitro autoradiography showed no direct competition of the drugs with [F-18]PSS232 for the allosteric binding site of mGluR5. DVRs of [F-18]PSS232 binding in vivo did not change in any brain region neither after bolus injection nor after infusion. We conclude that [F-18]PSS232 has utility for measuring mGluR5 density or occupancy of the allosteric site in vivo, but it cannot be used to measure in vivo fluctuations of glutamate levels in the rat brain.

In the present study, we report on the evaluation of a new radiopharmaceutical peptide for its potential to visualization for CXCR4-expressing tumors in vivo. Methods: A CXCR4 antagonist analogue was synthesized using a standard Fmoc solid phase strategy and labeled with Tc-99m via HYNIC and EDDA/tricine as coligands. In addition, stability in human serum, receptor binding internalization, in vivo tumor uptake, and tissue biodistribution were evaluated. Labeling procedure has been accomplished at 100 degrees C. RTLC and HPLC analysis methods have been used to confirm the procedure. The receptor binding internalization rate studied using B16-F10 melanoma tumor cells. C57BL/6 mice bearing B16-F10 tumor were used for radiopeptide biodistribution studies. Results: Labeling yield of >95% (n = 3) was obtained corresponding to a specific activity of 123 +/- 60 GBq/mu mol. Efficient stability in the presence of human serum was observed. The radioligand showed specific internalization (of total add) into B16-F10 cells (1.57 +/- 0.27% at 2 h). In animal biodistribution study, the uptake in mouse tumor was 2.74 +/- 0.47% ID/g after 15 min (percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue). Conclusion: Results of this study show that labeled peptide conjugate could be a potential candidate for diagnosis of malignant tumors. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the flexible benzyloxybenzene derivative [I-125]B-4 represents an excellent lead candidate for targeting A beta in AD brains. Based on that, we designed two pairs of more flexible and optically pure diphenoxy derivatives with a chiral center as novel A beta probes. These compounds possessed high affinity (K-i = 15.8-45.0 nM) for A beta(1-42) aggregates, and (R)-enantiomers showed slightly better binding ability than (S)-enantiomers. In addition, the competition binding assay implied that the optically pure diphenoxy derivatives with more flexible planar A beta probe. For I-125-radiolabeled enantiomers, (S)-[I-125]5 and (R)-[I-125]5 specific plaque labeling on brain sections of T-g mice and AD patients were observed in in vitro autoradiography, persuasively proving the excellent affinity of the probes. In biodistribution, (S)-[I-125]5 and (R)-[I-125]5 with relatively low lipophilicity exhibited moderate initial brain uptake (4.37% and 3.72% ID/g at 2 min, respectively) and extremely fast washout from normal mice brain (brain(2min)/brain(60min) = 19.0 and 17.7, respectively). In summary, the separate enantiomers displayed similar properties in vitro and in vivo, and (S/12)-[I-123]5 may be potential SPECT probes for recognizing Afi plaques in AD brains.

R.			5-HT<sub>3</sub> Receptor Brain-Type B-Subunits are Differentially Expressed in Heterologous Systems	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Serotonin; cys-loop; heteromeric; single channel	BINDING-SITES; LOOP; ACTIVATION	Genes for five different 5-HT3 receptor subunits have been identified. Most of the subunits have multiple isoforms, but two isoforms of the B subunits, brain-type 1 (Br1) and brain-type 2 (Br2) are of particular interest as they appear to be abundantly expressed in human brain, where 5-HT3B subunit RNA consists of approximately 75% 5-HT3Br2, 24% 5-HT3Br1, and <1% 5-HT3B. Here we use two-electrode voltage-clamp, radioligand binding, fluorescence, whole cell, and single channel patch-clamp studies to characterize the roles of 5-HT3Br1 and 5-HT3Br2 subunits on function and pharmacology in heterologously expressed 5-HT3 receptors. The data show that the 5-HT3Br1 transcriptional variant, when coexpressed with 5-HT3A subunits, alters the EC50, n(H), and single channel conductance of the 5-HT3 receptor, but has no effect on the potency of competitive antagonists; thus, 5-HT(3)ABr1 receptors have the same characteristics as 5-HT(3)AB receptors. There were some differences in the shapes of 5-HT(3)AB and 5-HT(3)ABr1 receptor responses, which were likely due to a greater proportion of homomeric 5-HT(3)A versus heteromeric 5-HT(3)ABr1 receptors in the latter, as expression of the 5-HT3Br1 compared to the 5-HT3B subunit is less efficient. Conversely, the 5-1-IT(3)Br2 subunit does not appear to form functional channels with the 5-HT3A subunit in either oocytes or HEK293 cells, and the role of this subunit is yet to be determined.

In this study, we analyze clinical outcomes of TN BC and implications of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. Clinical and biologic features, time to first recurrence (TTFR), and overall survival (OS) were compared in 253 TN versus 1,036 ER positive, PgR positive, HER2-negative [estrogen-driven (ED)] BC. Compared to ED, TN tumors were larger (p = 0.02), more proliferative (high S-phase 54 vs. 17 %, p < 0.0001), more aneuploid (64 vs. 43 %, p < 0.0001) and more likely EGFR positive (a parts per thousand yen10 fmol/mg by radioligand-binding assay, 49 vs. 7 %, p < 0.0001). Among TN, EGFR-positive BC were larger (p = 0.0018), more proliferative (p < 0.0001), and more aneuploid, (p < 0.0001) than EGFR-negative BC. Adjuvant-treated TN patients had shorter TTFR (p = 0.0003), and OS (p = 0.0017), than ED patients. However, in untreated patients, no differences in TTFR and OS were observed at 8 years median follow-up. Among TN patients, EGFR expression was not associated with worse outcome. TN tumors have a worse outcome in systemically treated patients but not in untreated patients. EGFR expression, does not predict for worse long-term survival.

There are clear functional interactions between dopaminergic and serotonergic type 2A receptors (5-HT2A)-mediated neurotransmission. Moreover, 5-HT2A receptor antagonists can reduce L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID). We hypothesized that enhanced 5-HT2A -mediated neurotransmission may be involved in the genesis of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Radioligand binding autoradiography, using [H-3]-ketanserin, was performed to define 5-HT2A receptor levels in brain tissue from macaques: 6 normal; 5 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-lesioned, parkinsonian macaques, without exposure to L-DOPA; 6 MPTP-lesioned, parkinsonian macaques, receiving a single administration of L-DOPA, and exhibiting no dyskinesia; and 6 MPTP-lesioned, parkinsonian, macaques chronically treated with L-DOPA, and exhibiting dyskinesia. 5-HT2A receptor binding was increased in the caudate, putamen, and middle layers of the motor cortex in chronically L-DOPA-treated animals, by 50%, 50%, and 45% respectively, compared with normal macaques. 5-HT2A binding was not significantly altered in parkinsonian, untreated, or parkinsonian, single treatment, nondyskinetic macaques, compared with normal. These data provide an anatomical basis for mechanisms to explain the efficacy of 5-HT2A antagonists against dyskinesia. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Results: In vitro binding studies show a K-i value of 2.21 nM at the 5-HTIF receptor, compared with K-i values of 1043 nM and 1357 nM at the 5-HTIB and 5-HTID receptors, respectively, a selectivity ratio greater than 470-fold. Lasmiditan showed higher selectivity for the 5-HTIF receptor relative to other 5-HTI receptor subtypes than the first generation 5-HTIF receptor agonist LY334370. Unlike the 5-HTIB/ID receptor agonist sumatriptan, lasmiditan did not contract rabbit saphenous vein rings, a surrogate assay for human coronary artery constriction, at concentrations up to 100 mu M. In two rodent models of migraine, oral administration of lasmiditan potently inhibited markers associated with electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion (dural plasma protein extravasation, and induction of the immediate early gene c-Fos in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis). Conclusions: Lasmiditan presents a unique pyridinoyl-piperidine scaffold not found in any other antimigraine class. Its chemical structure and pharmacological profile clearly distinguish it from the triptans. The potency and selectivity of lasmiditan make it ideally suited to definitively test the involvement of 5-HTIF receptors in migraine headache therapy.

Central opioidergic neurotransmission in complex regional pain syndrome	NEUROLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; HUMAN BRAIN; AMYGDALA; STIMULATION; SYSTEM; QUANTIFICATION; AVAILABILITY; MODULATION	Objective: Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic pain condition characterized by sensory, motor, and autonomic symptoms. It develops after limb trauma and may be associated with relevant psychiatric comorbidity. As there is evidence for central pathophysiology which might be related to an altered opioidergic neurotransmission, we investigated the cerebral opioid receptor status under resting conditions in this patient population. Methods: In this case-control study, 10 patients with CRPS and 10 age-and gender-matched healthy subjects underwent a PET scan using the subtype-nonselective opioidergic radioligand [F-18] fluoroethyl-diprenorphine. As a surrogate for regional cerebral opioid receptor availability, the opioid receptor binding potential (OR-BP) was assessed by means of the modified Logan plot with reference region input for categorical group comparison and correlation with clinical data in the patient group. Results: Patients with CRPS showed reduced OR-BP in contralateral amygdala and parahippocampal gyri and increased OR-BP in contralateral prefrontal cortical areas. When OR-BP in the midcingulate cortex and the ipsilateral temporal cortex was low, the McGill pain rating index was high. In general, when anxiety and depression scales were high, contralateral temporal OR-BP was high as well. In addition, the anxiety scale decreased with increasing OR-BP in the contralateral parahippocampal cortex. Conclusions: These results demonstrate altered central opioidergic neurotransmission in CRPS. The correlation of regional opioid receptor availability to measures of pain, anxiety, and depression underlines the clinical importance of these findings.

However, in previous studies, we showed that C-terminal truncation of the gastrin-17 (G17) to the G17 analog G17(1-12) and then to G17(1-6)-NH2 did not remove the ability to bind to DLD-1 cells or to activate proliferation. This implies that residues and/or structural motifs required for bioactivity at these receptors rest in the N-terminal region of G17. In this work, radioligand binding studies conducted with further C-terminally truncated analogs revealed that sequences as short as G17(1-4) still bind to a single receptor with micromolar affinity. Additionally, cell proliferation assays showed that G17(1-12) stimulates proliferation of DLD-1 cells, as of HT-29 cells, but the sequences shorter than G17(1-6)-NH2, including non-amidated G17(1-6), were incapable of stimulating proliferation. These observations indicate that the tetrapeptide pGlu-Gly-Pro-Trp is the minimum N-terminal sequence for binding to the probable growth-promoting site on DLD-1 cells. Since analogs shorter than G17(1-6) are able to bind the receptor, these peptides may be of use for developing selective antagonists. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We aimed to investigate the properties of alpha 2* nAChRs in these mouse brain regions. Methods: alpha 2 nAChR subunit-null mutant mice were engineered. Pharmacological and immunoprecipitation studies were used to determine the composition of alpha 2 subunit-containing (alpha 2*) nAChRs in these two regions. Results: [I-125] Epibatidine (200 pmol/L) autoradiography and saturation binding demonstrated that alpha 2 deletion reduces nAChR expression in both olfactory bulbs and interpeduncular nucleus (by 4.8 +/- 1.7 and 92 +/- 26 fmol.mg(-1) protein, respectively). Pharmacological characterization using the beta(2)-selective drug A85380 to inhibit [I-125] epibatidine binding proved inconclusive, so immunoprecipitation methods were used to further characterize alpha 2* nAChRs. Protocols were established to immunoprecipitate beta 2 and beta 4 nAChRs. Immunoprecipitation specificity was ascertained using tissue from beta 2- and beta 4-null mutant mice, and efficacy was good (>90% of beta 2* and >80% of beta 4* nAChRs were routinely recovered). Conclusion: Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that interpeduncular nucleus alpha 2* nAChRs predominantly contain beta 2 subunits, while those in olfactory bulbs contain mainly beta 4 subunits. In addition, the immunoprecipitation evidence indicated that both nuclei, but especially the interpeduncular nucleus, express nAChR complexes containing both beta 2 and beta 4 subunits.

Heterologous Expression and Purification of the Serotonin Type 4 Receptor from Transgenic Mouse Retina	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; RHODOPSIN MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHAPERONES; QUALITY-CONTROL; CELL-SURFACE; SF9 CELLS; IN-VIVO; PROMOTER	Recent breakthroughs in the solution of X-ray structures for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with diffusible ligands have employed extensively mutated or recombined receptor fusion proteins heterologously expressed in conventional in vitro cell-based systems. While these advances now show that crystallization of non-rhodopsin members of this superfamily can be accomplished, the use of radically modified proteins may limit the relevance of the derived structures for precision-guided drug design. To better enable the study of native GPCR structures, we report here efforts to engineer an in vivo expression system that harnesses the photoreceptor system of the retina to express heterologous GPCRs with native human sequences in a biochemically homogeneous and pharmacologically functional conformation. As an example, we show that the human 5HT4 receptor, when placed under the influence of the mouse opsin promoter and an opsin rod outer segment (ROS) targeting sequence, localized to ROS of transgenic mouse retina. The resulting receptor protein was uniformly glycosylated and pharmacologically intact as demonstrated by immunoblotting and radioligand binding assays. Upon solubilization, the retinal 5HT4 receptor retained the binding properties of its initial state in retinal membranes. With the engineered T7 monoclonal epitope sequence, the solubilized receptor was easily purified by one-step immunoaffinity chromatography and the purified receptor in detergent solution preserved its ligand binding properties. This expression method may prove generally useful for generating functional, high-quality GPCR protein.

Using electrophysiological recordings of muOR activation of G-protein-coupled K+ channels (K(ir)3) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and AtT20 cells, confocal microscopy of receptor localization, and radioligand binding of cell surface receptors, we resolved these desensitization mechanisms to determine the domain of muOR important for receptor uncoupling. Activation of muOR by saturating concentrations of [D-Ala(2), N-Me-Phe(4), Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), methadone, or fentanyl, but not morphine, produced robust internalization of a green fluorescent protein-tagged muOR. A subsaturating concentration of DAMGO (100 nM) did not cause receptor internalization but markedly reduced the subsequent responsiveness of K(ir)3 by uncoupling muOR. muOR desensitization in AtT20 cells was confirmed to be homologous, because desensitization by 100 nM DAMGO was blocked by dominant-negative forms of either G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) or arrestin, and pretreatment with DAMGO did not affect the K(ir)3 response to somatostatin receptor activation. Alanine substitution of a single threonine in the second cytoplasmic loop of the muOR ( Threonine 180) blocked agonist-dependent receptor uncoupling without affecting receptor internalization. These results suggest that GRK-dependent phosphorylation of muOR required threonine 180 for uncoupling but that a different GRK and arrestin-dependent mechanism controlled muOR internalization in AtT20 cells.

Since changes in angiotensin type 1 (AT,) receptor expression are central to modulation of the RAS, we used the noninvasive PET imaging technique to study for the in vivo effects of estrogen on membrane and intracellular AT, receptors. Methods: Dynamic PET measurements of canine AT(1) (cAT(1)) receptors using the radiolabeled AT, receptor antagonist, "C-L-159,884, were performed during 2-wk consecutive periods of estrogen deprivation induced by ovariectomy and 17beta-estradiol (E2) replacement. Results: Kinetic modeling of time-activity curves in the kidney and adrenal showed lower receptor expression in the estrogen replete state (21 % and 30% decrease in Gjedde-Patlak slope, influx constant, respectively). These in vivo find- ings correlated with in vitro radioligand-binding assays with I-125-[Sar(1),IIe(8)]angiotensin II showing reduced AT(1) receptor number in the adrenal (35%), glomeruli (30%), myocardium (35%), and liver (21 %) in the estrogen-replenished compared with estrogen-depleted animals. Conclusion: Although other endogenous systems are known to regulate AT, receptors and could compete with estrogenic actions, these PET studies reveal that estrogen attenuates AT, receptor expression in vivo. Thus, estrogen modulation of AT, receptors may contribute to the cardiovascular protective effects associated with estrogen.

However, factors that regulate their actions in the heart are poorly understood. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that endothelin-1, a peptide hormone that produces a pattern of cardiac hypertrophy distinct from LIF and cardiotrophin-1, modulates LIF-induced signaling in cardiomyocytes. Upon binding LIF or cardiotrophin-1, the LIF receptor alpha subunit (LIFRalpha) dimerizes with gp130, leading to activation of constitutively associated Jak1 proteins and LIFRalpha-gp130 tyrosine phosphorylation. W found that pretreatment of neonatal rat ventricular myocytes with endothelin-1 rapidly inhibited LIF-induced LIFRalpha tyrosine phosphorylation and Jak1 activation. This effect of endothelin-1 on LIF and Jak1 was attenuated by the MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059, implicating involvement of the ERK kinases. Radioligand binding studies showed that inhibition of LIF signaling resulted from a reduction in cell surface LIFRalpha levels. Additionally, endothelin-1 was found to reduce LIF-induced STAT3 activation, as indexed by STAT3 Y-705 phosphorylation. Finally, endothelin-1 and LIF were shown to induce opposite patterns of STAT3 activation in cardiomyocytes. LIF induced rapid, robust STAT3 Y-705 phosphorylation; endothelin-1 produced a delayed, modest increase, and initially decreased STAT3 Y-705 phosphorylation. Overall our findings indicate that endothelin-1 acts to temper IL-6-related cytokine signaling in cardiomyocytes, in particular STAT3 activation.

The majority of patients with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus has autoantibodies to insulin, glutamic acid decarboxylase and the tyrosine phosphatase-like protein IA-2. Some patients with Type I diabetes, in particular with adult onset diabetes, have, however, only cytoplasmic islet cell antibodies that could be directed to as yet unknown beta cell autoantigens. Recently, one potential antigen, ICA12, was identified as the high mobility group (HMG) box transcription factor SOX-13. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of autoantibodies to SOX-13 for autoimmune diabetes. Methods. Full-length SOX-13 was cloned from human brain mRNA, expressed by vitro transcription/translation and used to detect autoantibodies by immunoprecipitation and radioligand assay in patients suffering from autoimmune diabetes or non-organ-specific autoimmune diseases. Results, We found SOX-13 antibodies to be present in 11 of 125 (8.8%) patients with newly diagnosed Type I diabetes and in 3 of 43 (7.0%) patients with latent autoimmune diabetes in adults. There was no association with age, sex and a particular pattern of diabetes-specific autoantibodies. Similar frequencies of SOX-13 antibodies were found in 84 patients with rheumatic diseases (4.0-11.4%) and 211 healthy control subjects (5.2%). Conclusions/interpretation. Our data indicate that SOX-13 represents a minor target of autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune diabetes. Because SOX-13 antibodies were found not to be disease-specific, we assume they are not helpful in improving the diagnosis and prediction of Type I diabetes.

We have recently reported that mGluR1 availability in the early stage of AD is equivalent to that in healthy subjects. This study aimed to address whether mGluR1 availability changes with the progression of AD. Methods Eight patients with AD (79.1 +/- 4.6 years) underwent a total of two positron emission tomography (PET) examinations using the mGluR1 radioligand during the early-to-middle stages of AD. The mean interval was 2.8 years. Volumes-of-interest were placed on the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, hippocampus, anterior and posterior lobes, and vermis in the cerebellum. The binding potential (BPND) was calculated to estimate mGluR1 availability, applying partial volume correction to the BPND values. Results No significant difference was observed in BPND values between the first and second PET examinations in the frontal cortex (p = 0.94), parietal cortex (p = 0.67), temporal cortex (p = 0.20), hippocampus (p = 0.17), anterior lobe (p = 0.73), posterior lobe (p = 0.21), and vermis (p = 0.22). Conclusion This study suggests that mGluR1 availability is unchanged in the follow-up period of a few years during the early-to-middle stages of AD.

Here, we report the radiosynthesis and preclinical evaluation of [Ga-68]Ga-NOTA-folate (Ga-68-FOL). After determining the affinity of Ga-68-FOL using cells expressing FR-beta, we studied atherosclerotic mice with Ga-68-FOL and F-18-FDG PET/CT. In addition, we studied tracer distribution and co-localization with macrophages in aorta cryosections using autoradiography, histology, and immunostaining. The specificity of Ga-68-FOL was assessed in a blocking study with folate glucosamine. As a final step, human radiation doses were extrapolated from rat PET data. We were able to produce Ga-68-FOL with high radiochemical purity and moderate molar activity. Cell binding studies revealed that Ga-68-FOL had 5.1 nM affinity for FR-beta. Myocardial uptake of Ga-68-FOL was 20-fold lower than that of F-18-FDG. Autoradiography and immunohistochemistry of the aorta revealed that Ga-68-FOL radioactivity co-localized with Mac-3-positive macrophage-rich atherosclerotic plaques. The plaque-to-healthy vessel wall ratio of Ga-68-FOL was significantly higher than that of F-18-FDG. Blocking studies verified that Ga-68-FOL was specific for FR. Based on estimations from rat data, the human effective dose was 0.0105 mSv/MBq. Together, these findings show that Ga-68-FOL represents a promising new FR-beta -targeted tracer for imaging macrophage-associated inflammation.

Given the pivotal role of mouse models in understanding neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, this study aims to validate and characterize [C-11]UCB-J in mice. We performed a blocking study to verify the specificity of the radiotracer to SV2A, examined kinetic models using an image-derived input function (IDIF) for quantification of the radiotracer, and investigated the in vivo metabolism. Regional TACs during baseline showed rapid uptake of [C-11]UCB-J into the brain. Pretreatment with levetiracetam confirmed target engagement in a dose-dependent manner. V-T (IDIF) values estimated with one- and two-tissue compartmental models (1TCM and 2TCM) were highly comparable (r=0.999, p < 0.0001), with 1TCM performing better than 2TCM for K-1 (IDIF). A scan duration of 60 min was sufficient for reliable V-T (IDIF) and K-1 (IDIF) estimations. In vivo metabolism of [C-11]UCB-J was relatively rapid, with a parent fraction of 22.5 +/- 4.2% at 15 min p.i. In conclusion, our findings show that [C-11]UCB-J selectively binds to SV2A with optimal kinetics in the mouse representing a promising tool to noninvasively quantify synaptic density in comparative or therapeutic studies in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorder models.

This study sought to investigate the effects of age on 5-HT6 receptor availability using C-11-GSK215083, a PET ligand with affinity for 5-HT6 in the striatum and 5-HT2A in the cortex. Methods: Twenty-eight healthy male volunteers (age range, 23-52 y) were scanned with C-11-GSK215083 PET. Time-activity curves in regions of interest were fitted using a multilinear analysis method. Nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the cerebellum as the reference region and corrected for partial-volume effects. Results: In 5-HT6-rich areas, regional C-11-GSK215083 showed a negative correlation between BPND and age in the caudate (r = -0.41, P = 0.03) (14% change per decade) and putamen (r = -0.30, P = 0.04) (11% change per decade) but not in the ventral striatum or pallidum. A negative correlation with age was also seen in cortical regions (r = -0.41, P 5 0.03) (7% change per decade), consistent with the literature on 5-HT2A availability. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this was the first in vivo study on humans to examine the effect of age on 5-HT6 receptor availability. The study demonstrated a significant age-related decline in 5-HT6 availability (BPND) in the caudate and putamen.

Impact of paroxetine on proximal β-adrenergic receptor signaling	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article						Paroxetine; beta-adrenergic receptor; G protein-coupled receptor kinase; beta-arrestin	KINASE 2; CARDIAC-FUNCTION; HEART-FAILURE; PROTEIN; INHIBITORS; ARRESTIN; ACTIVATION; ABLATION; INJURY	D-adrenergic receptors (beta AR) regulate numerous functions throughout the body, however G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-dependent desensitization of beta AR has long been recognized as a maladaptive process in the progression of various disease states. Thus, the development of small molecule inhibitors of GRKs for the study of these processes and as potential therapeutics has been at the forefront of recent research efforts. Via structural and biochemical analyses, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine was identified as a GRK2 inhibitor that enhances PAR-dependent cardiomyocyte and cardiac contractility and reverses cardiac dysfunction and myocardial DAR expression in mouse models of heart failure. Despite these functional outcomes, consistent with diminished beta AR desensitization, the proximal PAR signaling mechanisms sensitive to paroxetine have not been reported. In this study, we aimed to determine whether paroxetine prevents classic beta AR desensitization-related signaling mechanisms at a molecular level. Therefore, via immunoblotting, radioligand binding, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and microscopy assays, we have performed an assessment of the effect of paroxetine on proximal beta AR signaling responses. Indeed, paroxetine treatment inhibited ligand-induced beta 2AR phosphorylation in a concentration -dependent manner. Additionally, for both beta 1AR and beta 2AR, paroxetine decreased ligatid-induced beta arrestin2 recruitment and subsequent receptor internalization. Thus, paroxetine inhibits DAR desensitization mechanisms consistent with GRK2 inhibition and provides a useful pharmacological tool for studying these proximal GPCR signaling responses.

Apoptosis and necrosis have been implicated in MDMA-induced neurotoxicity, but the role of autophagy in MDMA-elicited serotonergic toxicity has not been investigated. The present study aimed to examine the contribution of autophagy to neurotoxicity in serotonergic neurons in in vitro and in vivo animal models challenged with MDMA. Here, we demonstrated that in cultured rat serotonergic neurons, MDMA exposure induced LC3B-densely stained autophagosome formation, accompanying by a decrease in neurite outgrowth. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) significantly attenuated MDMA-induced autophagosome accumulation, and ameliorated MDMA-triggered serotonergic neurite damage and neuron death. In contrast, enhanced autophagy flux by rapamycin or impaired autophagosome clearance by bafilomycin Al led to more autophagosome accumulation in serotonergic neurons and aggravated neurite degeneration. In addition, MDMA-induced autophagy activation in cultured serotonergic neurons might be mediated by serotonin transporter (SERT). In an in vivo animal model administered MDMA, neuroimaging showed that 3-MA protected the serotonin system against MDMA-induced downregulation of SERT evaluated by animal-PET with 4-[(18F)]-ADAM, a SERT radioligand. Taken together, our results demonstrated that MDMA triggers upregulation of autophagy in serotonergic neurons, which appears to be detrimental to neuronal growth. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Discovery and Mapping of an Intracellular Antagonist Binding Site at the Chemokine Receptor CCR2	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; SMALL-MOLECULE; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; DRUG DISCOVERY; ACTIVATION; IDENTIFICATION; COMPLEX; GPCR; ACETYLCHOLINE	The chemokine receptor CCR2 is a G protein-coupled receptor that is involved in many diseases characterized by chronic inflammation, and therefore a large variety of CCR2 small molecule antagonists has been developed. On the basis of their chemical structures these antagonists can roughly be divided into two groups with most likely two topographically distinct binding sites. The aim of the current study was to identify the binding site of one such group of ligands, exemplified by three allosteric antagonists, CCR2-RA-[R], JNJ-27141491, and SD-24. We first used a chimeric CCR2/CCR5 receptor approach to obtain insight into the binding site of the allosteric antagonists and additionally introduced eight single point mutations in CCR2 to further characterize the putative binding pocket. All constructs were studied in radioligand binding and/or functional IP turnover assays, providing evidence for an intracellular binding site for CCR2-RA-[R], JNJ-27141491, and SD-24. For CCR2-RA-[R] the most important residues for binding were found to be the highly conserved tyrosine Y-7.53 and phenylalanine F-8.50 of the NPxxYx((5,6))F motif, as well as V-6.36 at the bottom of TM-VI and K-8.49 in helix-VIII. These findings demonstrate for the first time the presence of an allosteric intracellular binding site for CCR2 antagonists. This contributes to an increased understanding of the interactions of diverse ligands at CCR2 and may allow for a more rational design of future allosteric antagonists.	[Zweemer, Annelien J.

Development of a new epidermal growth factor receptor positron emission tomography imaging agent based on the 3-cyanoquinoline core: Synthesis and biological evaluation	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						EGFR; [(18)F]-PET imaging; 3-Cyanoquinoline; Click chemistry	TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITORS; PUTATIVE IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITOR; ANILINOQUINAZOLINE DERIVATIVES; CLICK CHEMISTRY; POSITIVE TUMORS; PHASE-I; EGFR; CANCER; DRUG; CU-64-DOTA-CETUXIMAB	The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/c-ErbB1/HER1) is overexpressed in many cancers including breast, ovarian, endometrial, and non-small cell lung cancer. An EGFR specific imaging agent could facilitate clinical evaluation of primary tumors and/or metastases. To achieve this goal we designed and synthesized a small array of fluorine containing compounds based on a 3-cyanoquinoline core. A lead compound, 16, incorporating 2'-fluoroethyl-1,2,3-triazole was selected for evaluation as a radioligand based on its high affinity for EGFR kinase (IC(50) = 1.81 +/- 0.18 nM), good cellular potency (IC(50) = 21.97 +/- 9.06 nM), low lipophilicity and good metabolic stability. 'Click' labeling afforded [(18)F]16 in 37.0 +/- 3.6% decay corrected radiochemical yield based on azide [(18)F]14 and 7% end of synthesis (EOS) yield from aqueous fluoride. Compound [(18)F]16 was obtained with > 99% radiochemical purity in a total synthesis time of 3 h. The compound showed good stability in vivo and a fourfold higher uptake in high EGFR expressing A431 tumor xenografts compared to low EGFR expressing HCT116 tumor xenografts. Furthermore, the radiotracer could be visualized in A431 tumor bearing mice by small animal PET imaging. Compound [(18)F]16 therefore constitutes a promising radiotracer for further evaluation for imaging of EGFR status. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study investigated whether ME10092 regulates the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B)-mediated signal transduction in vivo. The effect of ME10092 treatment (1-100 pmol/mouse) on nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, activation of expression of inflammatory mediators and production of nitric oxide were measured in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced brain inflammation model in mice in vivo. The antinociceptive activity of ME10092 was tested in the formalin-induced paw licking test. ME10092 dose-dependently inhibited LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NF-kappa B, transcription of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (INF-alpha), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements showed that ME10092 inhibited the LPS-induced increase in nitric oxide content in mouse brain tissue in a dose-dependent manner. In the formalin-induced paw licking test, ME10092 (at the dose of 3 mg/kg, p.o. twice daily for eight days) significantly reduced nociceptive response. In conclusion, above results indicate that ME10092 inhibits NF-kappa B activation and suppresses the upregulation of inflammatory mediators in experimental models in vivo. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of racemic phenibut and its optical isomers in pharmacological tests and GABA(B) receptor binding studies. In pharmacological tests of locomotor activity antidepressant and pain effects, S-phenibut was inactive in doses up to 500 mg/kg. In contrast, R-phenibut turned out to be two times more potent than racemic phenibut in most of the tests. in the forced swimming test, at a dose of 100 mg/kg only R-phenibut significantly decreased immobility time. Both R-phenibut and racemic phenibut showed analgesic activity in the tail-flick test with R-phenibut being slightly more active. An GABA(B) receptor-selective antagonist (3-aminopropyl)(diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid (CGP35348) inhibited the antidepressant and antinociceptive effects of R-phenibut, as well as locomotor depressing activity of R-phenibut in open field test in vivo. The radioligand binding experiments using a selective GABA(B) receptor antagonist [H-3]CGP54626 revealed that affinity constants for racemic phenibut, R-phenibut and reference GABA-mimetic baclofen were 177 +/- 2, 92 +/- 3, 6.0 +/- 1 mu M, respectively. We conclude that the pharmacological activity of racemic phenibut relies on R-phenibut and this correlates to the binding affinity of enantiomers of phenibut to the GABA(B) receptor.

We Studied the gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)) receptor in a series of binding assays in membranes from rat brain. The GABA(A) receptor was probed using the radioligand [H-3]t-butylbicycloorthobenzoate ([H-3]TBOB) which binds to the convulsant recognition site of the receptor. The results demonstrated that the short-chain t-ethers and their t-alcohol metabolites inhibit binding at the convulsant site of the GABA(A) receptor, The potency of the inhibition tended to correlate with carbon chain length, For agents having an equal number of carbon atoms, potency of inhibition of [H-3]TBOB binding was greater in magnitude for the alcohols than for the ethers. The descending rank order of potency for the ethers and alcohols were as follows. t-amyl alcohol (TAA); t-amyl-methyl ether (TAME), ethyl-t-butyl ether (ETBE) > t-butyl alcohol (TBA) > methyl-t-butyl ether (MTBE) > ethanol. In additional saturation binding assays, MTBE reduced apparent density of convulsant binding (B-max). (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Fenik, P; Ogawa, H; Veasey, SC				Fenik, P; Ogawa, H; Veasey, SC			Hypoglossal nerve response to 5-HT<sub>3</sub> drugs injected into the XII nucleus and vena cava in the rat	SLEEP			English	Article						sleep apnea; serotonin; XII; motoneurons; 5-HT3; CPBG; ondansetron; nodose ganglion	META-CHLOROPHENYLBIGUANIDE; RECOGNITION SITES; SLEEP APNEAS; C-FOS; SEROTONIN; RECEPTORS; NEURONS; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; AGONIST	Systemically administered ondansetron, a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, reduces obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (OSDB) events in the English bulldog. The neural mechanisms through which ondansetron acts are unknown. 5-HT3 receptor immunoreactivity and mRNA have been detected in the vicinity of upper airway dilator motoneurons (UAWDMn's), suggesting that this receptor may contribute to the state-dependent modulation of UADMn's. To characterize 5-HT3 receptor activity within a representative UAWD nucleus, we performed acute microinjections of selective 5-HT3 drugs, 1-(m-Chlorophenyl) -biguanide HCl, an agonist, and ondansetron, an antagonist, into a major population of UADMn's, the hypoglossal nucleus (XII), in anesthetized, paralyzed and mechanically-ventilated rats. The 5-HT3-selective drugs neither altered the baseline XII nerve activity nor the excitatory effect of 5-HT microinjected into the XII. In contrast, system ic-ad ministration of ondansetron (3 mg/kg) produced a significant increase in the inspiratory modulation of XII nerve activity (to 195.8%+/- 19.3 of control, p <0.001). Together, these data suggest that 5-HT3 receptors within the XII nucleus do not mediate 5-HT effects on XII motoneurons, rather antagonism of 5-HT3 receptors outside the XII nucleus can increase respiratory drive to XII motoneurons. These results highlight the importance of understanding serotonergic effects on respiratory drive outside the UAWD motor nuclei as we search for 5-HT drug therapies for OSDB.

In this study, we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of the new human histamine H-3 receptor (H3R) ligands with flavonoid structure in murine microglial BV-2 cells. Material and methods The affinity of flavonoids (E243 -flavone and IIIa-IIIc-chalcones) for human H3R was evaluated in the radioligand binding assay. The cytotoxicity on BV-2 cell viability was investigated with the MTS assay. Preliminary evaluation of anti-inflammatory properties was screened by the Griess assay in an in vitro neuroinflammation model of LPS-treated BV-2 cells. The expression and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines were evaluated by real-time qPCR and ELISA, respectively. The expression of microglial cell markers were determined by immunocytochemistry. Results Chalcone derivatives showed high affinity at human H3R with K-i values < 25 nM. At the highest nontoxic concentration (6.25 mu M) compound IIIc was the most active in reducing the level of nitrite in Griess assay. Additionally, IIIc treatment attenuated inflammatory process in murine microglia cells by down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) at both the level of mRNA and protein level. Our immunocytochemistry studies revealed expression of microglial markers (Iba1, CD68, CD206) in BV-2 cell line. Conclusions These results emphasize the importance of further research to accurately identify the anti-inflammatory mechanism of action of chalcones.

We, therefore, aimed to develop a method that allowed the estimation of blood clearance kinetics in vitro. For this purpose, Lu-177-labeled PSMA radioligands were subjected to a SEC column with human serum albumin (HSA) dissolved in a mobile phase. The HSA-mediated retention time of each PSMA ligand generated by this novel 'albumin-mediated size exclusion chromatography' (AMSEC) was converted to a ligand-specific apparent molecular weight (MWapp), and a normalization accounting for unspecific interactions between individual radioligands and the SEC column matrix was applied. The resulting normalized MWapp,norm. could serve to estimate the blood clearance of renally excreted radioligands by means of their influence on the highly size-selective process of glomerular filtration (GF). Based on the correlation between MW and the glomerular sieving coefficients (GSCs) of a set of plasma proteins, GSC(calc) values were calculated to assess the relative differences in the expected GF/blood clearance kinetics in vivo and to select lead candidates among the evaluated radioligands. Significant differences in the MWapp,norm. and GSC(calc) values, even for stereoisomers, were found, indicating that AMSEC might be a valuable and high-resolution tool for the preclinical selection of therapeutic lead compounds for clinical translation.

J	Schellenberg, LM; Regenthal, R; Abraham, G				Schellenberg, Linda Marie; Regenthal, Ralf; Abraham, Getu			The Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 reduces the β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor density but enhance cAMP formation in primary equine bronchial epithelial cells	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Y-27632; beta(2)-adrenoceptors; cAMP; Bronchial epithelial cells; Equine asthma	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; CA2+ SENSITIZATION; AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; TRACHEAL; ASTHMA; TARGET; DESENSITIZATION; CONTRACTION	The present study addresses the effect of the Rho-kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 on the beta(2)-adrenoceptor density and beta-agonist-stimulated intracellular second messenger cAMP formation in primary equine bronchial epithelial cells (EBEC). Y-27632 significantly decreased the beta(2)-adrenoceptor number (B-max) without markedly affecting the receptor affinity (dissociation constant, K-D) to the radioligand [I-125]-iodocyanopindolol (ICYP). In contrast, Y-27632 augmented the beta-agonist-stimulated intracellular cAMP production. Herein, Y-27632 markedly increased the maximal cAMP responses (E-max) (isoproterenol > epinephrine > norepinephrine) but did not shift the beta-agonist concentration-effect curves to the left. The beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118.551 and the beta(1/)beta(2)-antagonsit propranolol but not the beta(1)-selctive antagonist CGP 20712A reversed the isoproterenol-induced cAMP formation equally in Y-27632-treated and control EBEC, suggesting the effect was merely related to the beta(2)-subtype. These results show that Y-27632 differentially regulates the receptor density and function. Thus, these findings provide the first evidence that the functional interaction of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor and Rho-kinase (ROCK) signaling pathways decreases the receptor expression but enhances receptor downstream cAMP formation. This differential regulation of the receptor density and function by Y-27632 should be further reconsidered with regard to the beneficial effect of the drug in asthma therapy.

Herein we describe the synthesis, radiolabeling, and preliminary biological evaluation of the novel PSMA-D4 ligand. Synthesized PSMA-D4 was characterized using TOF-ESI-MS, NMR, and HPLC methods. The novel compound was subject to molecular modeling with GCP-II to compare its binding mode to analogous reference compounds. The radiolabeling efficiency of PSMA-D4 with Lu-177, Y-90, Sc-47, and Ac-225 was chromatographically tested. In vitro studies were carried out in PSMA-positive LNCaP tumor cells membranes. The ex vivo tissue distribution profile of the radioligands and Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) was studied in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice. PSMA-D4 was synthesized in 24% yield and purity >97%. The radio complexes were obtained with high yields (>97%) and molar activity ranging from 0.11 to 17.2 GBq mcmol(-1), depending on the radionuclide. In vitro assays confirmed high specific binding and affinity for all radiocomplexes. Biodistribution and imaging studies revealed high accumulation in LNCaP tumor xenografts and rapid clearance of radiocomplexes from blood and non-target tissues. These render PSMA-D4 a promising ligand for targeted therapy of prostate cancer (PCa) metastases.

In addition, we wanted to explore the effect of derivatization of functional groups of the agonist binding moiety in compounds developed by us earlier from the hybrid template. Binding affinity (K-i) of the new compounds was measured with tritiated spiperone as the radioligand and HEK-293 cells expressing either D-2 or D-3 receptors. Functional activity of selected compounds was assessed in the GTP gamma S binding assay. In the imidazole series, compound 10a exhibited the highest D-3 affinity whereas the indole derivative 13 exhibited similar high D-3 affinity. Functionalization of the amino group in agonist (+)-9d with different sulfonamides derivatives improved the D-3 affinity significantly with (+)-14f exhibiting the highest affinity. However, functionalization of the hydroxyl and amino groups of 15 and (+)-9d, known agonist and partial agonist, to sulfonate ester and amide in general modulated the affinity. In both cases loss of agonist potency resulted from such derivatization. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study investigated the effect of variation in 5-HTT expression on 5-HT4 receptor levels in both 5-HTT knockout (KO) and over-expressing (OE) mice using autoradiography with the selective 5-HT4 receptor radioligand, [H-3]SB207145. Compared to wild-type (5-HTT+/+) controls, homozygous 5-HTT KO mice (5-HTT-/-) had reduced 5-HT4 receptor binding site density in all brain regions examined (35-65% of 5-HTT+/+). In contrast, the density of 5-HT4 receptor binding sites was not significantly different between heterozygous 5-HTT KO mice (5-HTT-/+) and 5-HTT+/+ mice. The 5-HT synthesis inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine (250 mg/kg twice daily for 3 d) abolished the difference in 5-HT4 binding between 5-HTT-/- and 5-HTT+/+ mice in all brain regions. Compared to wild-type (WT) littermate controls, 5-HTT OE mice had increased 5-HT4 binding density across all brain regions, except amygdala (118-164% of WT) and this difference between genotypes was reduced by the 5-HTT inhibitor, fluoxetine (20 mg/kg twice daily, 3 d). Together, these findings suggest that variation in 5-HTT expression causes adaptive changes in 5-HT4 receptor levels which are directly linked to alterations in 5-HT availability.

Extracellular loop C of NPC1L1 is important for binding to ezetimibe	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							CHOLESTEROL ABSORPTION INHIBITOR; STEROL-SENSING DOMAIN; BRUSH-BORDER MEMBRANE; RECEPTOR CLASS-B; SCAVENGER RECEPTOR; PRIMARY HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA; SENSITIVE CHOLESTEROL; LIPID ABSORPTION; HIGH-AFFINITY; SR-BI	Niemann-Pick C1-like protein (NPC1L1) mediates the absorption of dietary cholesterol in the proximal region of the intestine, a process that is blocked by cholesterol absorption inhibitors (CAIs), including ezetimibe (EZE). Using a proteomic approach, we demonstrate that NPC1L1 is the protein to which EZE and its analogs bind. Next, we determined the site of interaction of EZE analogs with NPC1L1 by exploiting the different binding affinities of mouse and dog NPC1L1 for the radioligand analog of EZE, [(3)H]AS. Chimeric and mutational studies indicate that high-affinity binding of [(3)H]AS to dog NPC1L1 depends on molecular determinants present in a 61-aa region of a large extracellular domain (loop C), where Phe-532 and Met-543 appear to be key contributors. These data suggest that the [(3)H]AS-binding site resides in the intestinal lumen and are consistent with preclinical data demonstrating in vivo efficacy of a minimally bioavailable CAI. Furthermore, these determinants of [(3)H]AS binding lie immediately adjacent to a hotspot of human NPC1L1 polymorphisms correlated with hypoabsorption of cholesterol. These observations, taken together with the recently described binding of cholesterol to the N terminus (loop A) of the close NPC1L1 homologue, NPC1, may provide a molecular basis for understanding EZE inhibition of NPC1L1-mediated cholesterol absorption. Specifically, HE binding to an extracellular site distinct from where cholesterol binds prevents conformational changes in NPC1L1 that are necessary for the translocation of cholesterol across the membrane.

Imaging of cerebral A, adenosine receptors (AIAR) with positron emission tomography (PET) has recently become available for neurological research. To date, it has still not been unraveled if there is a valid reference region without specific radioligand binding that may be used to improve image quantification. We conducted in vivo displacement studies in humans to elucidate this important question using the AIAR ligand [F-18]CPFPX. Methods: Five healthy male volunteers underwent [F-18]CPFPX bolus/infusion PET with short infusion of unlabelled CPFPX as competitor (n = 4; 0.9 to 4.0 mg) or vehicle (n = 1; control condition) after equilibrium of [F-18]CPFPX distribution was attained. Results: Infusion of CPFPX induced a rapid displacement of [F-18]CPFPX binding in all regions, including the cerebellum (region with lowest binding). Even at the highest competitor dose, no full displacement was reached. Displacement was dose-dependent in all regions except the cerebellum where floor effects and/or noise might have obscured dose dependency. Specific binding was estimated to account for about one third and two thirds of total equilibrium uptake in cerebellum and cortex, respectively. Conclusions: Although the cerebellum is the region with lowest in vivo [F-18]CPFPX binding, it is not an ideal reference region devoid of specific binding. Nevertheless, as will be discussed, the use of a reference region analysis may be a useful, non-invasive alternative analysis method in carefully selected applications. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Though CRF is involved in the aetiology of several stress-related disorders, including depression and anxiety, details of CRFR1 regulation such as internalization remain uncharacterized. In the present study, agonist-induced internalization of CRFR1 in HEK293 cells was visualized by confocal microcopy and quantified using the radioligand I-125-labelled sauvagine. Recruitment of beta-arrestin 1 in response to receptor activation was demonstrated by confocal microscopy. The extent of I-125-labelled sauvagine stimulated internalization was significantly impaired by sucrose, indicating the involvement of clathrin-coated pits. No effect on the extent of internalization was observed in the presence of the second messenger dependent kinase inhibitors H-89 and staurosporine, indicating that cAMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C are not prerequisites for CRFR1 internalization. Surprisingly, deletion of all putative phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail, as well as a cluster of putative phosporylation sites in the third intracellular loop, did not affect receptor internalization. However, these mutations almost abolished the recruitment of beta-arrestin 1 following receptor activation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CRFR1 internalization is independent of phosphorylation sites in the C-terminal tail and third intracellular loop, and the degree of beta-arrestin 1 recruitment.

In the present study, a series of iodinated derivatives and a fluorinated derivative of the classical alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, idazoxan, have been evaluated as potential imaging ligands. These compounds are based on the structure of idazoxan but more closely resemble the selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists 2-methoxy-idazoxan (RX821002) and 2-ethoxy-idazoxan (RX811059). Preliminary studies, investigating their affinities at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, using brain membranes prepared from a variety of species. and their ability to antagonise UK14. 304-induced inhibition of twitch in mouse vas deferens highlighted 2-iodopropoxy-idazoxan and 2-fluoroethoxy-idazoxan as the most promising candidates. Further characterisation of these two compounds showed they had a good selectivity for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors compared with imidazoline(2)-binding sites and beta-adrenoceptors. Additional functional studies also showed a lack of intrinsic activity at alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Following intravenous injection, both compounds were able to Cross the blood brain barrier when tested using an ex vivo binding assay. These data show that both 2-iodopropoxy-idazoxan and 2-fluoroethoxy-idazoxan have binding and functional properties Suitable for imaging ligands. Further Studies using radiolabelled forms of these ligands and a more extensive characterisation of their binding profiles are necessary but these initial evaluations demonstrate their potential.

Charged amino acids are strongly conserved in the ligand- binding domain of these receptor proteins. To investigate the role of particular residues in ligand binding of the serotonin 5-HT3AS receptor (5-HT3R), glutamate amino acid residues at three different positions, Glu(97), Glu(224), and Glu(235), in the extracellular N- terminal domain were substituted with aspartate and glutamine using site- directed mutagenesis. Wild type and mutant receptor proteins were expressed in HEK293 cells and analyzed by electrophysiology, radioligand binding, fluorescence measurements, and immunochemistry. A structural model of the ligand- binding domain of the 5- HT3R based on the acetylcholine binding protein revealed the position of the mutated amino acids. Our results demonstrate that mutations of Glu(97), distant from the ligand- binding site, had little effect on the receptor, whereas mutations Glu(224) and Glu(235), close to the predicted binding site, are indeed important for ligand binding. Mutations E224Q, E224D, and E235Q decreased EC50 and K-d values 5 - 20- fold, whereas E235D was functionally expressed at a low level and had a more than 100- fold increased EC50 value. Comparison of the fluorescence properties of a fluorescein- labeled antagonist upon binding to wild type 5- HT3R and E235Q, allowed us to localize Glu(235) within a distance of 1 nm around the ligand- binding site, as proposed by our model.

In this study, we report the synthesis and 1-125-radiolabelling of Compound 6 and its in vitro and in vivo properties. Compound 6 [2-(3'-iodo-4'-aminophenyl)-6-hydroxybenzothiazole] bound to synthetic Abeta((1-40)) fibrils in a saturable manner, exhibiting an affinity (Ki) of 11+/-1.1 nM in a competitive binding assay using a tritiated thioflavin T analog ([3H]BTA-1) as radioligand. [I-125]6 binding to synthetic Abeta((1-40)) fibrils fit a single-site model. [I-125]6 exhibited several-fold higher binding to homogenates of frontal cortex from post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brain relative to age-matched control brain homogenates. No difference in binding was observed in cerebellum. The ratio of radioactivity concentration between frontal cortex and cerebellum was 6-fold higher in AD brain homogenates than the age-matched control. [I-125]6 also readily penetrated the blood-brain barrier in normal control mice with an average radioactivity concentration of 6.43+/-0.62%ID/g detected in the whole brain at 2 min post i.v. injection. At 30 min, the radioactivity concentration decreased to 0.40+/-0.05%ID/g, indicating good clearance in the absence of amyloid deposits in the brain.

The involvement of receptors and serotonin- and dopamine-metabolizing enzymes in the emesis induced by ipecac syrup and these components was investigated. 1) In ferrets, the selective 5-HT3-receptor antagonist ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) prevented each emesis induced by TJN-119 (0.5 mL/kg, p.o.), cephaeline (0.5 mg/kg, p.o.) and emetine (5.0 mg/kg, p.o.), but the intraperitoneal administration of the selective dopamine D-2-receptor antagonist sulpiride failed to significantly suppress the TJN-119, cephaeline and emetine-induced emesis at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg that blocked apomorphine-induced emesis. 2) In the receptor binding assays, cephaeline and emetine had a distinct affinity to 5-HT4 receptor, but no or weak affinity to 5-HT1A. 5-HT3, nicotine, M-3, beta(1), NK1 and D-2 receptors. 3) Cephaeline and emetine did not affect activities of metabolic enzymes of 5-HT and dopamine (NIAO-A, MAO-B, tryptophan 5-hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase) in vitro. These results suggest that 5-HT3 receptor plays an important role in the emetic action of TJN-119, cephaeline and emetine, and the 5-HT4 receptor may be involved in their mechanisms.

Here we have studied a novel immune evasion mechanism of serotype 3 pneumococci, which are particularly resistant to phagocytosis. On their surfaces the bacteria express the factor H-binding inhibitor of complement (Hie), a protein of the pneumococcal surface protein C family. Using radioligand binding, microtiter plate assays, surface plasmon resonance analysis, and recombinant constructs of factor H, we located the binding site of Hie to short consensus repeats (SCRs) 8-11 in the middle part of factor H. This represents a novel microbial interaction region on factor H. The only other ligand known so far for SCRs 8-11 of factor H is C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein that binds to the pneumococcal C-polysaccharide. The binding sites of Hie and CRP within the SCR8-11 region were different, however, because CRP did not inhibit the binding of Hie and required calcium for binding. Binding of factor H to Hic-expressing pneumococci promoted factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b and restricted phagocytosis of pneumococci. Thus, virulent pneumococci avoid complement attack and opsonophagocytosis by recruiting functionally active factor H with the Hie surface protein. Hie binds to a previously unrecognized microbial interaction site in the middle part of factor H.

In a recent study, we reported that male rats fed a cafeteria diet, while becoming obese, developed hypertension and important changes in their renal alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes distributions. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether these alterations are sex dependent. After 10 weeks of the cafeteria diet, male and female rats had the same increase in fat pad weight and in plasma leptin levels. However, in contrast to males, females had normal blood pressure (BP). On the basis of radioligand-binding studies using [H-3]-RX821002 and confirming our recent observation, an increase in alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor densities occurred in kidneys of cafeteria-fed male but not female rats. Moreover, in contrast with the situation observed in males, ligand competition studies failed to reveal any change in the renal alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-adrenergic receptors subtypes distribution in females. Finally, in the cafeteria-fed females reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction experiments showed unaltered expression of these two alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes. These data thus suggest a strong relationship between the sexual dimorphism in the cafeteria diet-induced hypertension and altered expression of the alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor subtypes in the kidney.

Twelve control studies and foul preblocking studies (400 nmol/kg unlabeled MDL 100,907) were performed in isoflurane-anesthetized rhesus monkeys. The plasma input function was determined from arterial blood samples with metabolite measurements by extraction in ethyl acetate. The preblocking studies showed that a two-tissue compartment model was necessary to fit the time activity curves of all brain regions including the cerebellum-in other words, the need fur two compartments is not proof of specific binding. Therefore, a three-tissue compartment model was used to analyze the control studies, with three parameters fixed based on the preblocking data. Reliable fits of control data could be obtained only if no more than three parameters were allowed to vary. For routine use of [(11)C]MDL 100,907, several simplified methods were evaluated. A two-tissue (2T') compartment with one fixed parameter was the most reliable compartmental approach: a one-compartment model failed to fit the data adequately. The Logan graphical approach was also tested and produced comparable results to the 2T' model. However, a simulation study showed that Logan analysis produced a larger bias at higher noise levels. Thus, the 2T' model is the best choice for analysis of [(11)C]MDL 100,907 studies.

We have observed that these receptors differ substantially in their membrane trafficking after endocytosis, B2AR expressed in stably transfected HEK293 cells exhibits negligible (<10%) down-regulation after continuous incubation of cells with agonist for 3 h, as assessed both by radioligand binding (to detect functional receptors) and immunoblotting (to detect total receptor protein), In contrast, DOR exhibits substantial (greater than or equal to 50%) agonist-induced down-regulation when examined by similar means. Degradation of internalized DOR is sensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis. Flow cytometric and surface biotinylation assays indicate that differential sorting of B2AR and DOR between distinct recycling and non-recycling pathways (respectively) can be detected within similar to 10 min after endocytosis, significantly before the onset of detectable proteolytic degradation of receptors (similar to 60 min after endocytosis), Studies using pulsatile application of agonist suggest that after this sorting event occurs, later steps of membrane transport leading to lysosomal degradation of receptors do not require the continued presence of agonist in the culture medium. These observations establish that distinct GPCRs differ significantly in endocytic membrane trafficking after internalization by the same membrane mechanism, and they suggest a mechanism by which brief application of agonist can induce substantial down-regulation of receptors.

The analysis of GPCRs in natural membranes is laborious, as established methods are almost exclusively cell culture-based and only a few methods for immobilization in a natural membrane outside the cell are known. Within this study, we present a one-step, fast and robust immobilization strategy of the GPCR glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R). GLP-1R was synthesized in eukaryotic lysates harboring endogenous endoplasmic reticulum-derived microsomes enabling the embedment of GLP-1R in a natural membrane. Interestingly, we found that these microsomes spontaneously adsorbed to magnetic Neutravidin beads thus providing immobilized membrane protein preparations which required no additional manipulation of the target receptor or its supporting membrane. The accessibility of the extracellular domain of membrane-embedded and bead-immobilized GLP-1R was demonstrated by bead-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using GLP-1R-specific monoclonal antibodies. In addition, ligand binding of immobilized GLP-1R was verified in a radioligand binding assay. In summary, we present an easy and straightforward synthesis and immobilization methodology of an active GPCR which can be beneficial for studying membrane proteins in general.

Tc-99m(CO)(3)-MPPDTF is a neutral and lipophilic complex, which was confirmed by paper electrophoresis and octanol/water partition coefficient (P = 27.0 +/- 1.4, n = 3), respectively. In vivo biodistribution indicated that this complex had moderate brain uptake (0.53 +/- 0.10% ID/g at 5 min and 0.42 +/- 0.02% ID/g at 120min) and good retention (about 80% of the activity was retained in the brain at 120min post-injection). Regional brain distribution study showed that hippocampus, where the 5-HT1A receptor density is high, had the highest uptake (0.60 +/- 0.02% ID/g at 5min p.i.) and the cerebellum, where the 5-HT1A receptor density is low, had the lowest uptake (0.10 +/- 0.02% ID/g at 5min p.i.). After blocking with 8-OH-DPAT, the hippocampus uptake was decreased obviously while the cerebellum uptake was increased slightly. This result indicates that Tc-99m(CO)(3)-MPPDTF complex has specific binding to 5-HT1A receptor. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanisms by which endogenous opioids contribute to the pathophysiology of RLS remain unknown. We have studied opioid receptor availability in 15 patients with primary RLS and 12 age-matched healthy volunteers using PET and [C-11]diprenorphine, a non-selective opioid receptor radioligand. Ligand binding was quantified by generating parametric images of volume of distribution (V-d) using a plasma-derived input function. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to localize mean group differences between patients and controls and to correlate ligand binding with clinical scores of disease severity. There were no mean group differences in opioid receptor binding between patients and controls. However, we found regional negative correlations between ligand binding and RLS severity (international restless legs scale, IRLS) in areas serving the medial pain system (medial thalamus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate gyrus, insular cortex and orbitofrontal cortex). Pain scores (affective component of the McGill Pain Questionnaire) correlated inversely with opioid receptor binding in orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate gyrus. Our findings suggest that, the more severe the RLS, the greater the release of endogenous opioids within the medial pain system.

Here we examined the molecular basis of these alterations and whether these findings can be replicated in another cohort. Methods. Prefrontal cortex from depressed suicide victims and nonpsychiatric controls were obtained from the Lenhossek Human Brain Program, Budapest and the Maryland Brain Collection Program. [H-3]cyclic adenosine monophosphate binding and protein kinase A activity were determined by radioligand binding and enzymatic assay, respectively. Expression of catalytic and regulatory subunits was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. Results: [H-3]cyclic adenosine monophosphate binding and total and endogenous protein kinase A activity were significantly decreased in membrane and cytosol fractions of prefrontal cortex of depressed suicide victims from the Budapest cohort, with a similar magnitude (33%- 40% reduction) as reported for the Maryland cohort. In both cohorts, selective reduction (36%- 41%) in mRNA and protein expression of the regulatory RIIbeta and the catalytic Cbeta was observed. Conclusions: Our results suggest abnormalities in [H-3]cyclic adenosine monophosphate binding and catalytic activity kinase A in brain of depressed suicide victims, which could be due to reduced expression of RIIbeta and Cbeta. These abnormalities in PKA may be critical in the pathophysiology of depression.

We have characterised rat retinal D4 receptors using the D4 selective radioligand [I-125] L-750667 which bound specifically and saturably to rat retinal membranes with high affinity (K-d 0.06+/-0.02 nM) and exhibited a D4 receptor pharmacology. Comparison of the binding kinetics of [I-125] L-750667 and [H-3] spiperone revealed B-max values of 134 +/- 27 fmol/mg and 219+/-47 fmol/mg respectively, indicating that the dopamine D4 receptor is a major component of D2-like dopamine receptors in the rat retina. Modulation of retinal cAMP levels by quinpirole was used to evaluate the functional relevance of rat retinal dopamine D4 receptors. Quinpirole (0.03-3 muM) produced a dose-related decrease of the light sensitive cAMP pool which was reversed by haloperidol, clozapine and the D4 selective antagonist, L-745870 with a rank order of potency suggesting that the quinpirole effect is due to activation of the dopamine D4 receptors. The D2 selective ligand L-741626 had no effect on the quinpirole response confirming that the D4 receptor is the major receptor subtype mediating dopamine induced suppression of adenylate cyclase in the retina.

To identify the receptor subtypes, we performed [(125) I]epibatidine autoradiography in the presence of cytisine or A-85380. By comparing these results with binding data from human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells stably transfected with different combinations of rat nicotinic receptor subunits, we were able to quantify three distinct populations of [ (125) I]epibatidine binding sites with characteristics of alpha4beta2, alpha3beta2 and alpha3beta4 receptors. Although the predominant subtype in rat brain was alpha4beta2, non-alpha4beta2 binding sites were prominent in many regions. In the habenulo-peduncular system, cerebellum, substantia gelatinosa, and many medullary nuclei, alpha3beta4-like binding accounted for more than 40% of [I-125]epibatidine binding, and nearly all binding in superior cervical ganglion and pineal gland. Other regions enriched in alpha3beta4-like binding included locus ceruleus, dorsal tegmentum, subiculum and anteroventral thalamic nucleus. Regions enriched in alpha3beta2-like binding included the habenulo-peduncular system, many visual system structures, certain geniculate nuclei, and dopaminergic regions. The combination of autoradiography using a broad spectrum radioligand in the presence of selectivecompetitors, and data from binding to defined receptor subtypes in expression systems, allowed us to quantify the relative populations of these three subtypes.

However, the cellular distribution and the influence of endogenous serotonin (5-HT) on in vivo binding have not been fully examined. In this study, we investigated the effect of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine-produced destruction of 5-HT neurons, reserpine-induced 5-HT depletion, and fenfluramine-induced 5-HT increase on [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 binding in vivo. There was no significant change in the uptake of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in the slice of 5-HT denervated rat brain except in the raphe nucleus, where 5-HT cell bodies exist. There was no obvious effect of enhanced 5-HT release by fenfluramine or decreased release by reserpine on [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 binding in the dissected brain region. No significant effect was observed in the time course of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in the hippocampus and frontal cortex measured by PET. These results indicated that the in vivo binding of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex mainly reflects postsynaptic 5-HT1A, receptor binding, and that this binding is not sensitive to endogenous 5-HT, Synapse 40:122-129, 2001, (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We studied a woman with severe progressive SOH with blood pressure unresponsive to the presser effects of alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonists, We tested the hypothesis that a circulating factor in this patient interferes with vascular adrenergic neurotransmission. Preincubation of porcine pulmonary artery vessel rings with patient plasma produced a dose-dependent inhibition of vasoconstriction to phenylephrine in vitro, abolished vasoconstriction to direct electrical stimulation, and had no effect on nonadrenergic vasoconstrictive stimuli (endothelin-1), PGF-2 alpha (or KCl), Preincubation of vessels with control plasma was devoid of these effects. SOH plasma inhibited the binding of an alpha (1)-selective antagonist radioligand ([I-125]HEAT) to membrane fractions derived from porcine pulmonary artery vessel rings, rat liver, and cell lines selectively overexpressing human ARs of the alpha (1B) subtype but not other AR subtypes (alpha (1A) and alpha (1D)), We conclude that a factor in SOH plasma can selectively and irreversibly inhibit adrenergic ligand binding to alpha (1B) ARs, We propose that this factor contributes to a novel pathogenesis for SOH in this patient. This patient's syndrome represents a new disease entity, and her plasma may provide a unique tool for probing the selective functions of alpha (1)-ARs.

The present study investigated the effects of dexamethasone on P-AR density, high-affinity P-agonist binding, G(s)alpha and G(i)alpha protein expression, and cAMP responses in bovine tracheal smooth muscle (bTSM). Dexamethasone treatment of cultured bTSM cells increased total beta-AR density 1.6- to 1.9-fold as assessed by the saturation binding of [H-3]CGP-12177 and by displacement of radioligand binding with isoproterenol. Isoproterenol bound to the 6-AR at two sites, a high-affinity site with a density of 5.9 +/- 1.2 fmol/mg protein and a low-affinity site with a density of 16.9 +/- 1.0 fmol/mg protein. Dexamethasone increased both high- and low-affinity isoproterenol binding sites to 11.1 +/- 2.2 and 25.9 +/- 2.1 fmol/mg protein, respectively, without influencing agonist binding affinities. Dexamethasone also selectively increased G(s)alpha protein levels from 0.99 +/- 0.14 to 1.46 +/- 0.17 mu g/mg protein without affecting G(i)alpha levels. The net effect of these changes was a 1.8-fold increase in maximal isoproterenol-induced cAMP generation in dexamethasone-treated bTSM cells. These findings provide new insights into the corticosteroid regulation of P-adrenergic signaling pathways in airway smooth muscle.

The internalization of the wild-type (WT) rat GnRH-R, stop codon mutants, GnRH-R/TRH receptor (TRK-R) chimera, rat TRH-R, and catfish GnRH-R was examined using radioligand binding assay. Overexpression of beta-arrestin in COS-7 cells expressing each of the receptor constructs substantially increased endocytosis rate constants (k(e)) of the TRH-R, catfish GnRH-R, and GnRH-R/TRH-R chimera, but not of the WT rat GnRH-R and stop codon mutants. The beta-arrestin-promoted increase in the k(e) value was diminished by co- transfecting cells with the dominant negative beta-arrestin-(319-418) mutant, whereas WT GnRH-R and stop codon mutant internalization were unaffected. Additionally, confocal microscopy showed that activated GnRH-Rs failed to induce time-dependent redistribution of either beta-arrestin-1- or beta-arrestin-2-green fluorescent protein conjugate to the plasma membrane. However, the dominant negative dynamin (DynK44A) mutant impaired internalization of all of the receptors regardless of their p-arrestin dependency, indicating that they internalize via a clathrin-mediated pathway. We conclude that the mammalian GnRH-R uses a beta-arrestin-independent, dynamin-dependent internalization mechanism distinct from that employed by the other receptors studied.

The major goal of this amplitudinous update is to summarize findings for natural polypeptide ligands of K+ channels, as well as data for the artificial derivatives of these substances obtained over the decades of exploration. We manually analyzed more than 700 original manuscripts and systematized the information on mutagenesis, production of radio- and fluorescently labeled derivatives, and the molecular pharmacology of K+ channel ligands. As a result, data on more than 1200 substances were processed and added enriching the database content fivefold. We also included the electrophysiological data obtained on the understudied and neglected K+ channels including the heteromeric and concatenated channels. We associated target channels in Kalium with corresponding entries in the official database of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology. Kalium was supplemented with an adaptive Statistics page, where users are able to obtain actual data output. Several other improvements were introduced, such as a color code to distinguish the range of ligand activity concentrations and advanced tools for filtration and sorting.

Understanding mechanisms of metabolic suppression during hibernation torpor promises new therapies for critical care. The activation of the Adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)AR) has been shown to be necessary and sufficient for entrance into hibernation with a winter season sensitization to the agonist, but the role of the A(1)AR in seasonal sensitization is unknown. In the current study, we characterize the A(1)AR in the forebrain, hippocampus and hypothalamus of summer and torpid AGS. For the first time, we define the pharmacological characteristics of the A(1)AR agonist, N-6-cyclohexyladenosine and the A(1)AR antagonist dipropylcyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) in the AGS brain. In addition, we test the hypothesis that increased A(1)AR agonist efficacy is responsible for sensitization of the A(1)AR during the torpor season. The resulting S-35-GTP gamma S binding data indicate an increase in agonist potency during torpor in two out of three brain regions. In addition to S-35-GTP gamma S binding, [H-3]DPCPX saturation and competition assays establish for the first-time pharmacological characteristics for the A(1)AR agonist, N-6-cyclohexyladenosine and the A(1)AR antagonist dipropylcyclopentylxanthine (DPCPX) in AGS brain.

However, toxicity, intolerance, and low efficiency of the available AEDs have prompted the continual attempts in the discovery of new AEDs. In this study, we discovered a skeleton of triazolopyrimidine for the development of new AEDs. The design, synthesis, in vivo anticonvulsant activity evaluation of triazolopyrimidines (3a-3i and 6a-6e), and pyrazolopyrimidines (4a-4i) are reported. We found that most triazolopyrimidines showed anticonvulsive activity in the maximal electroshock (MES) and pentetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizure models. On the contrary, pyrazolopyrimidines (4a-4i) showed weak or no protective effects. Among the tested derivatives, compound 6d, holding a median effective dose (ED50) of 15.8 and 14.1 mg/kg against MES and PTZ-induced seizures, respectively, was found to be the most potent one. Moreover, the protection index (PI) value of 6d was significantly higher than that of the available AEDs such as valproate, carbamazepine, and diazepam. The antiepileptic efficacy of compound 6d was also observed in the 3-mercaptopropionic acid and bicuculline-induced seizure models. Antagonistic effects of flumazenil and 3-MP for the anticonvulsive activity of 6d and also the radioligand-binding assay confirmed the involvement of GABA receptors, at least benzodiazepine (BZD) receptor, in the anticonvulsant activity of compound 6d. The docking study of compounds 4e and 6d with GABA(A) receptor confirmed and explained their affinity to the BZD receptors.

Therefore, a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer targeting this ion channel could serve as a potential diagnostic tool by imaging the K(Ca)3.1 channel in vivo. It was envisaged to synthesize [F-18]senicapoc ([F-18]1) since senicapoc (1) shows high affinity and excellent selectivity towards the K(Ca)3.1 channels. Because problems occurred during F-18-fluorination, the [F-18]fluoroethoxy senicapoc derivative [F-18]28 was synthesized to generate an alternative PET tracer targeting the K(Ca)3.1 channel. Inhibition of the K(Ca)3.1 channel by 28 was confirmed by patch clamp experiments. In vitro stability in mouse and human serum was shown for 28. Furthermore, biodistribution experiments in wild type mice were performed. Since [F-18]fluoride was detected in vivo after application of [F-18]28, an in vitro metabolism study was conducted. A potential degradation route of fluoroethoxy derivatives in vivo was found which in general should be taken into account when designing new PET tracers for different targets with a [F-18]fluoroethoxy moiety as well as when using the popular prosthetic group [F-18]fluoroethyl tosylate for the alkylation of phenols.

A pharmacological profile of the high-affinity GluK5 kainate receptor	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Ionotropic glutamate receptor; Radioligand binding; Kinetics; Affinity; Glycosylation; Sf9	TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; BIOSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERIZATION; GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ACID RECEPTORS; ION CHANNELS; SUBUNITS; EXPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA	Mouse GluK5 was expressed in Sf9 insect cells and radiolabelled with [H-3]-kainate in receptor binding assays (K-d = 6.9 nM). Western immunoblotting indicated an Sf9 GluK5 band doublet corresponding to the glycosylated (128 kDa) and deglycosylated (111 kDa) protein, which was identical to the band pattern of native rat brain GluK5. A pharmacological profile of the high-affinity kainate receptor GluK5 is described which is distinct from the profiles of other kainate receptors (GluK1-3). The 27 tested ligands generally show a preferential affinity to GluK1 over GluK5, the exceptions being: dihydrokainate, (S)-5-fluorowillardiine, (S)-glutamate and quisqualate, where the affinity is similar at GluK1 and GluK5. In contrast, quisqualate shows 40-fold higher affinity at GluK5 over GluK3 whereas (S)-1-(2'-amino-2'-caboxyethyl) thienol[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2,4-dione (NF1231), (RS)-2-amino 3-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-4-yl)propionate (ATPA), dihydrokainate and (25,4R)-4-methyl-glutamate (SYM2081) have higher affinity at GluK3 compared to GluK5. Since some studies have indicated that GluK5 is associated with various diseases in the central nervous system (e.g. schizophrenia, temporal lobe epilepsy, bipolar disorder), selective GluK5 ligands could have therapeutic potential. The distinct pharmacological profile of GluK5 suggests that it would be possible to design ligands with selectivity towards GluK5. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

As cerebral 5-HT4 receptor (5-HT4R) binding has recently been recognized as a proxy for stable brain levels of 5-HT, we here test the hypothesis in healthy men and women that brain 5-HT levels, as indexed by cerebral 5-HT4R, are inversely correlated with trait aggression and impulsivity. Sixty-one individuals (47 men) underwent positron emission tomography scanning with the radioligand [C-11]SB207145 for quantification of brain 5-HT4R binding. The Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ) and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale were used for assessment of trait aggression and trait impulsivity. Among male subjects, there was a positive correlation between global 5-HT4R and BPAQ total score (P = 0.037) as well as BPAQ physical aggression (P = 0.025). No main effect of global 5-HT4R on trait aggression or impulsivity was found in the mixed gender sample, but there was evidence for sex interaction effects in the relationship between global 5-HT4R and BPAQ physical aggression. In conclusion we found that low cerebral 5-HT levels, as indexed by 5-HT4R binding were associated with high trait aggression in males, but not in females.

However, it was not possible to localize heightened expression of (1)-adrenoceptors to nerves, sweat glands, blood vessels, or keratinocytes using this technique. MethodsTo explore this in the present study, skin biopsies were obtained from 31 patients with CRPS type I and 23 healthy controls of similar age and sex distribution. Expression of (1)-adrenoceptors on keratinocytes and on dermal blood vessels, sweat glands, and nerves was assessed using immunohistochemistry. Results(1)-Adrenoceptors were expressed more strongly in dermal nerve bundles and the epidermis both on the affected and contralateral unaffected side in patients than in controls (P<0.05). However, expression of (1)-adrenoceptors in sweat glands and blood vessels was similar in patients and controls. (1)-Adrenoceptor staining intensity in the CRPS-affected epidermis was associated with pain intensity (P<0.05), but a similar trend for nerve bundles did not achieve statistical significance. DiscussionEpidermal cells influence nociception by releasing ligands that act on sensory nerve fibers. Moreover, an increased expression of (1)-adrenoceptors on nociceptive afferents has been shown to aggravate neuropathic pain. Thus, the heightened expression of (1)-adrenoceptors in dermal nerves and epidermal cells might augment pain and neuroinflammatory disturbances after tissue injury in patients with CRPS type I.

Allosteric modulators of the hERG K<SUP>+</SUP> channel Radioligand binding assays reveal allosteric characteristics of dofetilide analogs	TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						hERG K+ channel; Allosteric modulator; LUF6200; Potassium ions; [H-3]astemizole; [H-3]dofetilide	POTASSIUM CHANNEL; MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; SITES; RECEPTORS; IDENTIFICATION; INACTIVATION; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; DISCOVERY	Drugs that block the cardiac K+ channel encoded by the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG) have been associated with QT interval prolongation leading to proarrhythmia, and in some cases, sudden cardiac death. Because of special structural features of the hERG K+ channel, it has become a promiscuous target that interacts with pharmaceuticals of widely varying chemical structures and a reason for concern in the pharmaceutical industry. The structural diversity suggests that multiple binding sites are available on the channel with possible allosteric interactions between them. In the present study, three reference compounds and nine compounds of a previously disclosed series were evaluated for their allosteric effects on the binding of [H-3]astemizole and [H-3]dofetilide to the hERG K+ channel. LUF6200 was identified as an allosteric inhibitor in dissociation assays with both radioligands, yielding similar EC50 values in the low micromolar range. However, potassium ions increased the binding of the two radioligands in a concentration-dependent manner, and their EC50 values were not significantly different, indicating that potassium ions behaved as allosteric enhancers. Furthermore, addition of potassium ions resulted in a concentration-dependent leftward shift of the LUF6200 response curve, suggesting positive cooperativity and distinct allosteric sites for them. In conclusion, our investigations provide evidence for allosteric modulation of the hERG K+ channel, which is discussed in the light of findings on other ion channels. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

However, the molecular basis of zebrafish prostanoid receptors has not been characterized to date. Here, we demonstrate that there exist at least six 'relaxant' (Gs-coupled) prostanoid receptors in zebrafish; one PGI(2) receptor IP and five PGE(2) receptors comprising two EP2 (EP2a and EP2b), and three EP4 receptors (EP4a, EP4b and EP4c). In contrast, we failed to find a zebrafish PGD(2) receptor with any structure and/or character similarities to the mammalian DP1 receptor. [H-3]iloprost, a stable IP radioligand, specifically bound to the membrane of cells expressing zebrafish IP with a Kd of 42 nM, and [H-3]PGE(2) specifically bound to the membranes of cells expressing zebrafish EP2a, EP2b, EP4a, EP4b and EP4c with a Kd of 6.9, 6.0, 1.4, 3.3 and 1.2 nM, respectively. Upon agonist stimulation, the 'relaxant' prostanoid receptors showed intracellular cAMP accumulation. The responsiveness of these zebrafish receptors to subtype-specific agonists correlated with their structural conservation to the corresponding receptor in mammals. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the six zebrafish prostanoid receptors show unique tissue distribution patterns; each receptor gene may hence be under unique transcriptional regulation. This work provides further insights into the diverse functions of prostanoids in zebrafish. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Identifying the binding site(<i>s</i>) for antidepressants on the <i>Torpedo</i> nicotinic acetylcholine receptor: [<SUP>3</SUP>H]2-azidoimipramine photolabeling and molecular dynamics studies	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOMEMBRANES			English	Article						Torpedo nAChR; Noncompetitive inhibitors; Tricyclic antidepressants; Photolabeling; Molecular modeling	NONCOMPETITIVE INHIBITORS; AFFINITY-CHROMATOGRAPHY; ION-CHANNEL; MECHANISMS; ANTAGONISTS; PROTEIN	Radioligand binding, photoaffinity labeling, and docking and molecular dynamics were used to characterize the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) binding sites in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nKhR). Competition experiments indicate that the noncompetitive antagonist phencyclidine (PCP) inhibits [3H]imipramine binding to resting (closed) and desensitized nAChRs. [H-3]2-azidoimipramine photoincorporates into each subunit from the desensitized nAChR with similar to 25% of the labeling specifically inhibited by TCP (a PCP analog), whereas no TCP-inhibitable labeling was observed in the resting (closed) state. For the desensitized nAChR and within the alpha subunit, the majority of specific [H-3]2-azidoimipramine labeling mapped to a similar to 20 kDa Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease fragment (alpha V8-20: Set(173)-Glu(338)). To further map the labeling site, the alpha V8-20 fragment was further digested with endoproteinase Lys-C and resolved by Tricine SDS-PAGE. The principal labeled fragment (11 kDa) was further purified by rpHPLC and subjected to N-terminal sequencing. Based on the amino terminus (alpha Met(243)) and apparent molecular weight, the 11 kDa fragment contains the channel lining M2 segment. Finally, docking and molecular dynamics results indicate that imipramine and PCP interact preferably with the M2 transmembrane segments in the middle of the ion channel. Collectively, these results are consistent with a model where PCP and TCA bind to overlapping sites within the lumen of the Torpedo nAChR ion channel. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Characterization of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor mutations identified in schizophrenic patients	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						serotonin receptor; ligand-gated ion channel; binding site; 5-HT3 receptor; schizophrenia; intracellular loop; whole-cell patch clamp; intracellular mutation; Cys-loop receptor; M3-M4	PROTEIN-KINASE-C; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(3) RECEPTORS; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; PHOSPHORYLATION; CONDUCTANCE; ANTAGONISTS; MODULATION; VARIANTS; REGION	The 5-HT3 receptor is a member of the Cys-loop family of ligand-gated ion channels, proteins that have been implicated in the pathology of several neurological disorders. In this study, we examine two mutations ((RH)-H-344 and (PR)-R-391) that have been previously identified in individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia. These mutations are located in the M3-M4 loop of the 5-HT3 receptor and their occurrence presents the possibility that they contribute toward the etiology of this disorder. Radioligand binding with the 5-HT receptor antagonist, [H-3]granisetron, revealed no significant difference in receptor affinity or density between mutant and wild-type receptors when expressed in HEK293 cells. However, comparison of EC50 values using whole-cell patch clamp for wild-type (1.68 mu M +/- 0.01, n = 38), (RH)-H-344 (1.70 mu M 0.02, n = 18), and (PR)-R-391 (2.73 mu M 0.01, n = 8) receptors revealed a significant increase in the EC50 of the (PR)-R-391 mutant. Analysis of Hill co-efficients, and activation and desensitization rate constants showed no significant difference between wild-type and mutant receptors. These data suggest that the (PR)-R-391, but not the (RH)-H-344, mutation may play a role in the pathology of schizophrenia.

High expression of sstr in NE tumours leads to tumour-specific uptake of radiolabelled somatostatin analogues and high absorbed doses. In this study, we present the first optimised radiation therapy via sstr using [Lu-177-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)]-octreotate given to nude mice xenografted with the human midgut carcinoid GOT1. The tumours in 22 out of 23 animals given therapeutic amounts showed dose-dependent, rapid complete remission. The diagnostic amount (0.5 MBq [Lu-177-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)]-octreotate) did not influence tumour growth and was rapidly excreted. In contrast, the therapeutic amount (30 MBq [Lu-177-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)]-octreotate) induced rapid tumour regression and entrapment of Lu-177 so that the activity concentration of Lu-177 remained high, 7 and 13 days after injection. The entrapment phenomenon increased the absorbed dose to tumours from 1.6 to 4.0 Gy MBq(-1) and the tumours in animals treated with 30 MBq received 120 Gy. Therapeutic amounts of [Lu-177-DOTA(0)-Tyr(3)]-octreotate rapidly induced apoptosis and gradual development of fibrosis in grafted tumours. In conclusion, human midgut carcinoid xenografts can be cured by receptor-mediated radiation therapy by optimising the uptake of radioligand and taking advantage of the favourable change in biokinetics induced by entrapment of radionuclide in the tumours.

The results indicate that cocaine in the concentration range of 3-500 muM reversibly inhibits cromakalim-induced K+ currents. The IC50 value for cocaine was 96 muM. Inhibition of the cromakalim-activated K+ current by cocaine was noncompetitive and voltage independent. Pretreatment with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA did not modify the cocaine-induced inhibition of cromakalim-induced K+ currents, suggesting that Ca2+-activated second messenger pathways are not involved in the actions of cocaine. Outward K+ currents activated by the application of 8-Br-cAMP or forskolin were also inhibited by cocaine. The EC50 and slope values for the activation of K+ currents by cromakalim were 184+/-19 muM and 1.14 in the absence of cocaine as compared to 191+/-23 muM and 1.03 in the presence of cocaine (300 muM). Cocaine also blocked K+ currents mediated through C-terminally deleted form of Kir6.2 (KirDeltaC26) in the absence of sulfonylurea receptor with an IC50 value of 87 muM, suggesting that cocaine interacts directly with the channel forming Kir6.2 subunit. Radioligand binding studies indicated that cocaine (100 muM) did not affect the binding characteristics of the K-ATP ligand, [H-3]glibenclamide. These results demonstrate that cromakalim-activated K+ currents in follicular cells of Xenopus oocytes are modulated by cocaine.

Methods: Human corneal fibroblast cultures were obtained using human donor corneas. CXCR4 receptors were characterized using binding studies and autoradiography with [I-125]SDF-1. The functionality of CXCR4 receptors was assessed by intracellular calcium measurement using a dynamic imaging microscopy system. CXCR4 and SDF-1 mRNA were detected in human corneal fibroblasts using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The CXCR4 protein was detected by western blot analysis. Results: [I-125]SDF-1 specifically bound to cultured corneal fibroblasts with a KD value of 8.3+/-1.2 nM. The presence of CXCR4 was confirmed by autoradiography of the radioligand on slices of corneal stroma. SDF-1 induced a rapid and transient intracellular calcium increase in cultured corneal fibroblasts that was blocked by the specific antagonist bicyclam. Moreover, a 48 kDa protein was detected by western blot analysis of corneal fibroblast extracts, using a specific CXCR4 polyclonal antibody. RT-PCR showed the expression of both CXCR4 and SDF-1 mRNAs in human corneal fibroblasts. Conclusions: These results indicate for the first time that cultured human corneal fibroblasts express the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1. This latter might exert physiological effects on the cornea and could be involved in pathological conditions such as corneal angiogenesis.

Several of the transport systems known to mediate efflux in the major clearing organs - liver and kidney - are also expressed in the intestine. Examples of secretory transporters in the intestine are P-glycoprotein, members of the multidrug resistance associated protein family, breast cancer resistance protein, organic cation transporters and members of the organic anion polypeptide family. In this communication, the P-glycoprotein mediated intestinal secretion of talinolol, a model compound showing metabolic stability, has been investigated in the jejunum, ileum and colon of rat intestine by single-pass perfusion. A model has been developed which demonstrates an increase in carrier-mediated secretion in the order jejunum < ileum < colon. Furthermore, the potency of common excipients in peroral drug products towards inhibition of P-gp mediated secretion has been investigated using a radioligand-binding assay and transport studies in Caco-2 cell monolayers. Finally, evidence is provided which demonstrates that constituents of grapefruit juice not only may influence intestinal drug metabolism, but can also interfere with secretory transport systems, leading to a new and yet undescribed mechanism in drug-food interactions.

To evaluate whether the receptors for melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) and its functional antagonist alpha -melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha -MSH) are expressed in the ciliary epithelium. Furthermore, to examine whether MCH, a neuropeptide involved in fluid and electrolyte homeostasis, may influence ion flux mediated by Na,K (adenosine triphosphatase)-ATPase in a ciliary epithelial cell line. METHODS. Expression of MCH receptors (MCH-R) and alpha -MSH receptors (MSH-R) on primary porcine ciliary pigmented epithelial (PE) cells and on a human nonpigmented ciliary epithelial (NPE) cell line, ODM-2 was investigated by radioligand binding studies and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The MCH-R nas further characterized by photocrosslinking. Influence of MCH on Na,K;-ATPase activity Nas evaluated by an Rb+ transport assay. RESULTS. MCH-R expression was observed at both the mRNA and protein levels in PE and NPE cells. In contrast, MSH-Rs were not detectable. At the mRNA level, expression of slc-1 was shown and with crosslinking, a 44-kDa protein was labeled. MCH showed no effect on Na,K-ATPase activity of NPE cells. CONCLUSIONS. The presence of MCH-R in ciliary epithelial cells of both human and porcine origin but the absence of MSPI-Rs indicates that in these cells, MCH and alpha -MSH do not form a functionally antagonistic hormonal pair as they do in several other systems. Although effects of MCH on intestinal water and ion transport have been documented, a direct control of Na,K-ATPase activity was not detected in human NPE cells in vitro.

Pyrimidinyl Biphenylureas Act as Allosteric Modulators to Activate Cannabinoid Receptor 1 and Initiate β-Arrestin-Dependent Responses	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							SIMULTANEOUS QUANTIFICATION; INTERNALIZATION; AGONIST; INHIBITOR; AFFINITY; SYSTEM; LIGAND; IMAGE	Cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is a G-protein-coupled receptor that is abundant in the central nervous system. It binds several compounds in its orthosteric site, including the endocannabinoids, arachidonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide) and 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, and the plant-derived Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol, one of the main psychoactive components of marijuana. It primarily couples to G(i/o) proteins to inhibit adenylate cyclase activity and typically induces downstream signaling that is G(i)-dependent. Since this receptor is implicated in several maladies, such as obesity, pain, and neurodegenerative disorders, there is interest in developing therapeutics that selectively target this receptor. Allosteric modulators of CB1 offer one new approach that has tremendous therapeutic potential. Here, we reveal receptor- and cellular-level properties consistent with receptor activation by a series of pyrimidinyl biphenylureas (LDK1285, LDK1288, LDK1305, and PSNCBAM1), including promoting binding of the agonist CP55940 with positive cooperativity and inhibiting binding of the inverse agonist SR141716A with negative cooperativity, demonstrated via radioligand binding studies. Consistent with these findings, the allosteric modulators induced cellular internalization of the receptor and recruitment of beta-arrestin 2 in human embryonic kidney cell line 293 cells monitored with confocal and total internal reflective fluorescence microscopy, respectively. These allosteric modulators, however, caused G-protein-independent but beta-arrestin 1-dependent phosphorylation of the downstream kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Src, shown by immunoblotting studies. These results are consistent with the involvement of beta-arrestin and suggest that these allosteric modulators induce biased signaling.	[Jagla, Caitlin A.

[F-18]FEPPA radiosynthesis was optimized to assess in a mouse model the cerebral inflammation induced by an intraperitoneal injection of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 5 mg/kg) 24 h before PET imaging. [F-18]FEPPA was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution (90 degrees C, 10 min) with tosylated precursor, followed by improved semi-preparative HPLC purification (retention time 14 min). [F-18]FEPPA radiosynthesis were carried out in 55 min (from EOB). The non-decay corrected radiochemical yield were 34 +/- 2% (n = 17), and the radiochemical purity greater than 99%, with a molar activity of 198 +/- 125 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis. Western blot analysis demonstrated a 2.2-fold increase in TSPO brain expression in the LPS treated mice compared to controls. This was consistent with the significant increase of [F-18]FEPPA brain total volume of distribution (V-T) estimated with pharmacokinetic modelling. In conclusion, [F-18]FEPPA radiosynthesis was implemented with high yields. The new purification/formulation with only class 3 solvents is more suitable for in vivo studies.

Pro-inflammatory activation of primary microglia and macrophages increases 18 kDa translocator protein expression in rodents but not humans	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; microglia; macrophages; inflammation; neurodegeneration	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN ADULT MICROGLIA; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; IN-VIVO; MOUSE MODEL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; BRAIN; TSPO; PET	The 18kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO) is the most commonly used tissue-specific marker of inflammation in positron emission tomography (PET) studies. It is expressed in myeloid cells such as microglia and macrophages, and in rodent myeloid cells expression increases with cellular activation. We assessed the effect of myeloid cell activation on TSPO gene expression in both primary human and rodent microglia and macrophages in vitro, and also measured TSPO radioligand binding with H-3-PBR28 in primary human macrophages. As observed previously, we found that TSPO expression increases (similar to 9-fold) in rodent-derived macrophages and microglia upon pro-inflammatory stimulation. However, TSPO expression does not increase with classical pro-inflammatory activation in primary human microglia (fold change 0.85 [95% CI 0.58-1.12], p = 0.47). In contrast, pro-inflammatory activation of human monocyte-derived macrophages is associated with a reduction of both TSPO gene expression (fold change 0.60 [95% CI 0.45-0.74], p = 0.02) and TSPO binding site abundance (fold change 0.61 [95% CI 0.49-0.73], p<0.0001). These findings have important implications for understanding the biology of TSPO in activated macrophages and microglia in humans. They are also clinically relevant for the interpretation of PET studies using TSPO targeting radioligands, as they suggest changes in TSPO expression may reflect microglial and macrophage density rather than activation phenotype.

During the search for new histamine H-4 receptor antagonists among 1,3,5-triazine derivatives, compound 2 (4-benzyl-6-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine) was found. Compound 2, weakly active for the H4 receptor but fitted in 3/4 of pharmacophore features of the 5-HT6R ligand, occurred to be a moderate 5-HT6R agent, useful as a lead structure for further modifications. A series of new derivatives (3-19) of the lead 2 was synthesized, evaluated in the radioligand binding assay (RBA) and explored in comprehensive molecular modelling, including both pharmacophore- and structure based approaches with docking to the homology model of 5-HT6R. The most active compounds displayed a potent affinity for the 5-HT6R in the nanomolar range (K-i = 20-30 nM), some of them (4,11 and 19) were tested in the rat forced swim test that revealed their antidepressant-like effect. SAR-analysis on the basis of both, RBA and docking results, indicated that action on the receptor is related to the hydrophobicity and the size of aromatic moiety substituted by a methylene linker at the position 4 of 1,3,5-triazine.

MEDICAL SCIENCE MONITOR			English	Article						Chemokine CXCL12; Prognosis; Radioligand Assay; Transcriptome	IN-VITRO; CELLS; RADIOSENSITIVITY; INHIBITOR; INVASION; KINASE	Background: Different sensitivity of advanced cervical cancer to irradiation can decrease effectiveness of radiotherapy in some cases. We attempted to identify the differentially expressed genes in residual cervical cancer after radiotherapy that might be associated with poor prognosis and radioresistance. Material/Methods: Differential genes expression was identified by an oligonucleotide microarray in cervical cancer tissues before radiation and after a 50-Gy dose of radiation. The microarray results were validated by quantitative real-time PCR. CXCL12 was validated by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded cervical cancer tissues before radiotherapy. The relationship between the differentiated gene and prognosis was validated by survival analysis. Results: Hierarchic cluster analysis identified 238 differentiated genes that exhibited >= 3.0-fold change and p<0.05. We found 111 genes that were in persistent up-regulation and 127 in persistent down-regulation after a 50-Gy dose of radiation when compared with the control group. These genes were involved in processes such as cell growth and death, cell-apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, cell signaling, DNA synthesis and repair, and cell adhesion. High differential expression of CXCL12, CD74, FGF7, COL14A1, PRC1, and RAD54L genes was validated by quantitative PCR before and after radiotherapy. Survival analysis results showed that the high expression of CXCL12 was closely related to poor prognosis.

Characterization of Novel Cannabinoid Based T-Type Calcium Channel Blockers with Analgesic Effects	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						hCav 3.2; T-type calcium channel; inflammatory pain; neuropathic pain; carbazole scaffold; electrophysiology	PAINFUL DIABETIC-NEUROPATHY; SENSORY NEURONS; CA2+ CHANNELS; BLOCKING ACTIVITY; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; SCIATIC-NERVE; RAT MODEL; INHIBITION; RECEPTOROME; TARGET	Low-voltage-activated (T-type) calcium channels are important regulators of the transmission of nociceptive information in the primary afferent pathway and finding ligands that modulate these channels is a key focus of the drug discovery field. Recently, we characterized a set of novel compounds with mixed cannabinoid receptoi/T-type channel blocking activity and examined their analgesic effects in animal models of pain. Here, we have built on these previous findings and synthesized a new series of small organic compounds. We then screened them using whole-cell voltage clamp techniques to identify the most potent T-type calcium channel inhibitors. The two most potent blockers (compounds 9 and 10) were then characterized using radioligand binding assays to determine their; affinity for CB1 and CB2 receptors. The structure activity relationship and optimization studies have led to the discovery of a new T-type calcium channel blocker, compound 9. Compound 9 was efficacious in mediating analgesia in mouse models of acute inflammatory pain and in reducing tactile allodynia in the partial nerve ligation model. This compound was shown to be ineffective in Cav3.2 T-type calcium channel null mice at therapeutically relevant concentrations, and it caused no significant motor deficits in open field tests. Taken together, our data reveal a novel class of compounds whose physiological and therapeutic actions are mediated through block of Cav3.2 calcium channels.

The new compounds were synthesized using Bucherer-Bergs reaction, two-phase alkylation, Mitsunobu reaction and/or an alkylation under microwave irradiation. The compounds developed were assessed on their affinity for serotoninergic receptors 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 and alpha(1)-ARs in radioligand binding assays. Selected compounds were tested on their inhibitory effect at human 5-HT3A expressed in Xenopus Oocytes as well as on their activity at alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes in functional and electrophysiological bioassays, respectively. Most of investigated compounds exhibited affinities for alpha(1)-ARs, 5-HT1A, 5-HT7 (K-i similar to 0.8-353 nM) significantly higher than those for 5-HT6 receptors. Very weak inhibitory effect at 5-HT3A accompanied with high activity at alpha(1D)-AR subtypes were observed for selected representative compounds. Among the current series, particularly 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(2-hydroxy-3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl) propyl)-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione hydrochloride (25a) displayed the highest 5-HT7 affinity with K-i = 3 nM and selectivity with 40-3600 fold towards 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and alpha(1)-ARs.

Identification and profiling of CXCR3-CXCR4 chemokine receptor heteromer complexes	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						chemokine receptor; GPCR; heteromerization; -arrestin; radioligand binding; CXCR3; CXCR4	RESONANCE ENERGY-TRANSFER; PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS; SMALL-MOLECULE; BINDING-PROPERTIES; BIVALENT LIGANDS; CXCR4; HETERODIMERS; OLIGOMERIZATION; DIMERIZATION; ANTAGONISTS	Background and Purpose The C-X-C chemokine receptors 3 (CXCR3) and C-X-C chemokine receptors 4 (CXCR4) are involved in various autoimmune diseases and cancers. Small antagonists have previously been shown to cross-inhibit chemokine binding to CXCR4, CC chemokine receptors 2 (CCR2) and 5 (CCR5) heteromers. We investigated whether CXCR3 and CXCR4 can form heteromeric complexes and the binding characteristics of chemokines and small ligand compounds to these chemokine receptor heteromers. Experimental Approach CXCR3CXCR4 heteromers were identified in HEK293T cells using co-immunoprecipitation, time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer, saturation BRET and the GPCR-heteromer identification technology (HIT) approach. Equilibrium competition binding and dissociation experiments were performed to detect negative binding cooperativity. Key Results We provide evidence that chemokine receptors CXCR3 and CXCR4 form heteromeric complexes in HEK293T cells. Chemokine binding was mutually exclusive on membranes co-expressing CXCR3 and CXCR4 as revealed by equilibrium competition binding and dissociation experiments. The small CXCR3 agonist VUF10661 impaired binding of CXCL12 to CXCR4, whereas small antagonists were unable to cross-inhibit chemokine binding to the other chemokine receptor. In contrast, negative binding cooperativity between CXCR3 and CXCR4 chemokines was not observed in intact cells. However, using the GPCR-HIT approach, we have evidence for specific -arrestin2 recruitment to CXCR3-CXCR4 heteromers in response to agonist stimulation. Conclusions and Implications This study indicates that heteromeric CXCR3CXCR4 complexes may act as functional units in living cells, which potentially open up novel therapeutic opportunities.

Positron emission tomography scans were performed in 12 healthy volunteers for 180 minutes. A two-tissue compartment model (2-CM) provided, with no exception, better fits to the data than a one-tissue model. Estimates of total distribution volume (V-T), specific distribution volume (V-S), and binding potential (BPND) demonstrated very good identifiability (based on coefficient of variation (COV)) for all the regions of interest (ROIs) in the gray matter (COV V-T < 7%, COV V-S < 8%, COV BPND < 11%). Reduction of the length of the scan to 2 hours is feasible as V-S and V-T showed only a small bias (6% and 7.5%, respectively). Monte Carlo simulations showed that, even under conditions of a 500% increase in specific binding, the identifiability of V-T and V-S was still very good with COV < 10%, across high-uptake ROIs. The excellent identifiability of V-T values obtained from an unconstrained 2-CM with data from a 2-hour scan support the use of V-T as an appropriate and feasible outcome measure for [F-18]-FEPPA.

Age and sex effects on 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors in the human brain: a [<SUP>11</SUP>C]SB207145 PET study	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						aging; gender; imaging; partial volume; receptor; serotonin	SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER BINDING; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POSTMORTEM HUMAN BRAIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; NORMATIVE DATA; DATABASE; WOMEN; VOLUNTEERS; ANXIETY	Experimental studies indicate that the 5-HT4 receptor activation influence cognitive function, affective symptoms, and the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prevalence of AD increases with aging, and women have a higher predisposition to both AD and affective disorders than men. This study aimed to investigate sex and age effects on 5-HT4 receptor-binding potentials in striatum, the limbic system, and neocortex. Positron-emission tomographic scans were conducted using the radioligand [C-11]SB207145 in a cohort of 30 healthy subjects (mean age 44 years; range 20 to 86 years; 14 men and 16 women). The output parameter, BPND, was modeled using the simplified reference tissue model, and partial volume correction was performed with the Muller-Gartner method. A decline with age of 1% per decade was found only in striatum. Women had a 13% lower 5-HT4 receptor binding in the limbic system. The lower limbic 5-HT4 receptor binding in women supports a role for 5-HT4 receptors in the sex-specific differences in emotional control and might contribute to the higher prevalence of affective diseases and AD in women. The relatively stable 5-HT4 receptor binding with aging contrasts others in subtypes of receptors, which generally decrease with aging.

[C-11]CUMI-101, proposed as the first 5-HT1A receptor agonist PET ligand, has been reported to behave as a potent 5-HT1A agonist in a cellular system stably expressing human recombinant 5-HT1A receptors. In this study, we investigate the agonist properties of CUMI-101 in rat brain tissue. Methods: [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding studies were used to determine receptor function in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells transfected with human recombinant 5-HT1A receptors and in rat cortex and rat hippocampal tissue, following administration of CUMI-101 and standard 5-HT1A antagonists (5-HT, 5-CT and 8-OH-DPAT). Results: CUMI-101 behaved as an agonist at human recombinant 5-HT1A receptors (pEC(50) 9.2). However, CUMI-101 did not show agonist activity in either rat cortex or hippocampus at concentrations up to 10 mu M. In these tissues, CUMI-behaved as an antagonist with pK(B)s of 9.2 and 9.3, respectively. Conclusions: Our studies demonstrate that as opposed to its behavior in human recombinant system, in rat brain tissue CUMI-101 behaves as a potent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

SL25.1188 was labelled with carbon-11 (T-1/2: 20.38 min) in one chemical step using the following process: (i) reaction of [C-11]phosgene with the corresponding ring-opened precursor (1.2-2.5 mg) at 100 degrees C for 2 min in dichloromethane (0.5 mL) followed by (ii) concentration to dryness of the reaction mixture and finally (iii) semi-preparative HPLC purification on a Waters Symmetry (R) C18. A total of 300-500 MBq of [C-11]SL25.1188 (>95% chemically and radiochemically pure) could be obtained within 30-32 min (Sep-pak-based formulation included) with specific radioactivities ranging from 50 to 70 GBq/mu mol (3.5-7% decay-corrected radiochemical yield, based on starting [C-11]CH4).

Several lines of clinical trials using NK1 receptor antagonists have been conducted to date, and the efficiency of preclinical assessments for proof of concept and dose optimization could be greatly increased by configuring an in vivo analytical system that permits quantitative mapping of NK1 receptors in the brains of small-size laboratory animals expressing "human-like" NK1 receptors. Hence, we investigated the applicability of experimental animals, ranging from rodents to primates, to positron emission tomographic (PET) measurements with [F-18]fluoroethyl-SPA-RQ a modification of a recently established radioligand for NK1 receptors. A pharmacokinetic assay could be performed for a rhesus monkey in an awake condition, which allows the circumvention of influences of anesthesia on SP neurotransmission. Coregistration of PET and magnetic resonance images acquired by small-animal-dedicated devices enabled detailed localization of NK1 receptors in the gerbil and marmoset brains. The present study also revealed the potentials of SDZ NKT 343 as an antagonist for central NK1 receptors. In conjunction with additional in vitro and ex vivo autoradiographic observations, our in vivo results have demonstrated a similarity in the binding pattern among the animals examined, justifying cross-species extrapolation of PET findings on the SPNK,pathway.

Its pleiotropic actions arise presumably by interaction with their cell surface G protein-coupled receptors. Herein, the presence of the specific nuclear lysophosphatidic acid receptor-1 (LPA(1)R) was revealed in unstimulated porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (pCMVECs), LPA(1)R stably transfected HTC4 rat hepatoma cells, and rat liver tissue using complementary approaches, including radioligand binding experiments, electron- and cryomicroscopy, cell fractionation, and immunoblotting with three distinct antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation studies in enriched plasmalemmal fractions of unstimulated pCMVEC showed that LPA(1)Rs are dually sequestrated in caveolin-1 and clathrin sub-compartments, whereas in nuclear fractions LPA1R appeared primarily in caveolae. Immunofluorescent assays using a cell-free isolated nuclear system confirmed LPA1R and caveolin-1 co-localization. In pCMVEC, LPA-stimulated increases in cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric-oxide synthase RNA and protein expression were insensitive to caveolea-disrupting agents but sensitive to LPA-generating phospholipase A(2) enzyme and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Moreover, LPA-induced increases in Ca2+ transients and/or iNOS expression in highly purified rat liver nuclei were prevented by pertussis toxin, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt inhibitor wortmannin and Ca2+ chelator and channel blockers EGTA and SK&F96365, respectively. This study describes for the first time the nucleus as a potential organelle for LPA intracrine signaling in the regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression.

These sites were found to be reversible, saturable, specific and displayed high affinity for DADLE. Scatchard analysis revealed a dissociation constant (K-d) Of 4.9+/-0.5 nmol/l, a maximum binding capacity (B-max) of 1.7 pmol/mg protein, and 5x10(5) binding sites per cell. The presence of opioid receptors suggests the possibility that enkephalins directly control ion transport in enterocytes. In order to verify this hypothesis, investigations were designed to determine whether these receptors are functional and whether enkephalins can inhibit the stimulation of adenosine 3',5' cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) synthesis induced by cholera toxin. The increase in cAMP synthesis induced by cholera toxin was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by H-Tyr-D-Ser-Gly-Phe-Leu-Thr-OH (DSLET), a delta-agonist. The enkephalinase inhibitor thiorphan potentiated this effect on IRD 98 cells, which contain enkephalinase. The action of DSLET was increased by 40% in the presence of this inhibitor. This effect was reversed by naltrindole, a potent delta-antagonist. Enkephalins can regulate intestinal secretion by acting directly on enterocytes; they thus have an antidiarrheal role, especially in the presence of an enkephalinase inhibitor.

The state of beta(2)-adrenergic receptors as related to the presence of this complication was investigated in a group of 15 essential hypertensive patients and compared to 10 normotensive control subjects. Left ventricular mass index was determined by bidimensional echocardiography, Plasma catecholamine levels were measured by a radioenzymatic assay, beta(2)-adrenoceptor density was measured in intact lymphocytes by radioligand binding assay, using the hydrophilic ligand CGP 12177. beta(2)-adrenoceptor function was assessed by measuring intracellular cAMP levels in isoproterenol-stimulated lymphocytes. Left ventricular mass index (P < 0.05), body mass index (P < 0.01), plasma noradrenaline levels (P < 0.05) and beta(2)-adrenoceptor density (P < 0.05) were higher in hypertensives than in controls. Left ventricular mass index correlated with body mass index both in normotensives and hypertensives, as well as with plasma noradrenaline levels only in normotensives. Left ventricular mass index also showed a positive correlation with mean arterial pressure and an inverse relationship with beta(2)-adrenoceptor density and response only in hypertensive patients, In conclusion, left ventricular hypertrophy in young essential hypertensives is associated to a reduced beta(2)-adrenoceptor density and function, probably as a compensating mechanism of the hypertrophied myocardiocyte secondary to the increased sympathetic outflow.

Crystal structure of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptor in complex with clinical candidate Etrumadenant reveals unprecedented antagonist interaction	COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY			English	Article							A(2B) RECEPTOR; PROTEIN; RADIOLIGAND; ZM241385; FEATURES	The G(s) protein-coupled adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)AR) represents an emerging drug target for cancer immunotherapy. The clinical candidate Etrumadenant was developed as an A(2A)AR antagonist with ancillary blockade of the A(2B)AR subtype. It constitutes a unique chemotype featuring a poly-substituted 2-amino-4-phenyl-6-triazolylpyrimidine core structure. Herein, we report two crystal structures of the A(2A)AR in complex with Etrumadenant, obtained with differently thermostabilized A(2A)AR constructs. This led to the discovery of an unprecedented interaction, a hydrogen bond of T88(3.36) with the cyano group of Etrumadenant. T88(3.36) is mutated in most A(2A)AR constructs used for crystallization, which has prevented the discovery of its interactions. In-vitro characterization of Etrumadenant indicated low selectivity versus the A(1)AR subtype, which can be rationalized by the structural data. These results will facilitate the future design of AR antagonists with desired selectivity. Moreover, they highlight the advantages of the employed A(2A)AR crystallization construct that is devoid of ligand binding site mutations. Etrumadenant has been developed as a dual-acting adenosine A(2A)/A(2B) receptor antagonist, and is now in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, however, the exact drug-receptor binding mode is unknown. Here, the authors determine the high-resolution co-crystal structure of Etrumadenant with a thermostabilized A(2A)AR construct and reveal the interaction of its cyano group with T88(3.36).

Antagonistic interactions between dopamine and A(2A) adenosine receptors serve as the basis for the development of AR antagonists as potential drug candidates for PD. All the synthesized compounds have been evaluated for their affinity toward AR subtypes using in vitro radioligand binding assays. 1,3-Dipropylxanthine 7a with a methyl substituent at N-7 position represents the most potent compound of the series and displayed highest affinity (A(2A), K-i = 0.108 mu M), however incorporation of a propargyl group at 7-positon of the xanthine nucleus seems to be the most appropriate substitution to improve selectivity towards the A(2A) subtype along with reasonable potency. Antiparkinsonian activity has been evaluated using perphenazine induced catatonia in rats. Most of the synthesized xanthines significantly lowered the catatonic score as compared to control and displayed antiparkinsonian effects comparable to standard drug. All the synthesized compounds were subjected to grid-based molecular docking studies to understand the key structural requirements for the development of new molecules well-endowed with intrinsic efficacy and selectivity as adenosine receptor ligands. In silico studies carried out on newly synthesized xanthines provided further support to the pharmacological results.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of Doxorubicin-containing conjugate targeting PSMA	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						PSMA; Doxorubicin; Targeted drug delivery; Prostate cancer	RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN PSMA; LU-177-PSMA-617 RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; GLUTAMATE CARBOXYPEPTIDASE II; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; INHIBITORS; PRODRUG; BIODISTRIBUTION; DESIGN	Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), also known as glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), has recently emerged as a prominent biomarker of prostate cancer (PC) and as an attractive protein trap for drug targeting. At the present time, several drugs and molecular diagnostic tools conjugated with selective PSMA ligands are actively evaluated in different preclinical and clinical trials. In the current work, we discuss design, synthesis and a preliminary biological evaluation of PSMA-specific small-molecule carrier equipped by Doxorubicin (Dox). We have introduced an unstable azo-linker between Dox and the carrier hence the designed compound does release the active substance inside cancer cells thereby providing a relatively high Dox concentration in nuclei and a relevant cytotoxic effect. In contrast, we have also synthesized a similar conjugate with a stable amide linker and it did not release the drug at all. This compound was predominantly accumulated in cytoplasm and did not cause cell death. Preliminary in vivo evaluation has showed good efficiency for the degradable conjugate against PC3-PIP(PSMA(+))-containing xenograft mine. Thus, we have demonstrated that the conjugate can be used as a template to design novel analogues with improved targeting, anticancer activity and lower rate of potential side effects. 3D molecular docking study has also been performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of binding and to further optimization of the linker area for improving the target affinity.

Significant amount of specific [I-125]ET-1 binding was detected in the lung, heart, kidney, bladder and cerebral cortex of rats. ET-1, bosentan, ambrisentan, and CI-1020 inhibited specific [I-125]ET-1 binding in these tissues in a concentration-dependent manner. The Hill coefficients of each agent in the rat lung and cerebral cortex and those of bosentan and ET-1 in the heart, kidney and bladder were close to unity, while the Hill coefficients of ambrisentan and CI-1020 in the heart, kidney and bladder were less than one. The nonlinear least squares regression analysis revealed the presence of high- and low-affinity ET-1 receptor sites in these tissues for ambrisentan and CI-1020. Oral administration of bosentan caused a dose-dependent decrease in specific [I-125]ET-1 binding in the rat lung, kidney and bladder, suggesting significant binding of the tissue ET-1 receptors in vivo. In conclusion, it has been shown that a significant amount of pharmacologically relevant ET-1 receptors may exist in rat tissues and that ET-1 receptor antagonists such as bosentan at pharmacological doses may exert some pharmacological effects by binding these ET-1 receptors.

Selective down-regulation of α4β2 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain of uremic rats with cognitive impairment	EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Renal failure; Cognitive impairment; Brain; Nicotinic receptors	EXPRESSION; STOICHIOMETRY; PHARMACOLOGY; SENSITIVITY; CORTEX; PHASE; MICE	Cognitive impairment is common in patients with chronic kidney disease. Brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors modulate cognitive functions, such as learning and memory. Pharmacological cholinergic enhancement is useful in patients with cognitive dysfunction. The major nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes in the brain are heteromeric alpha 4 beta 2 and homomeric alpha 7 receptors. To study the involvement of neuronal acetylcholine receptors in cognitive impairment in uremic rats, bilateral nephrectomy was performed. 24 weeks after nephrectomy, memory was assessed using the one trial step-down inhibitory avoidance test. Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain were studied by radioligand binding, immunoprecipitation, Western blot and sucrose gradient experiments. We demonstrated that rats with severe renal failure show disorders of short term memory. Long term memory was not altered in these rats. The number of functional alpha 4 beta 2 heteromeric neuronal nicotinic receptors was decreased in the brains of rats with severe renal failure. There was a significant correlation between the degree of renal impairment and the number of heteromeric nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain. The down-regulation of functional alpha 4 beta 2 receptors in the brains of rats with severe renal failure was not due to a reduction of alpha 4 or beta 2 subunit proteins. The number of alpha 7 homomeric neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors was not altered. These findings may have important clinical significance for the management of cognitive impairment in patients with chronic kidney disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AMYGDALOID pERK1/2 IN CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE OVEREXPRESSING MICE UNDER BASAL AND ACUTE STRESS CONDITIONS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						HPA axis; CRH; CRF; CRH receptor; ERK	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASES; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RAT-BRAIN; FACTOR-RECEPTOR; MAP KINASE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; TRANSGENIC MICE; MESSENGER-RNAS; CRF RECEPTORS; SWIM STRESS	Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) coordinates neuroendocrine and behavioral adaptations to stress. Acute CRH administration in vivo activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in limbic brain areas, acting through the CRH receptor type 1 (CRH-R1). In the present study, we used CRH-COE-Cam mice that overexpress CRH in limbic-restricted areas, to analyze the effect of chronic CRH overexpression on ERK1/2 activation. By immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy analysis we found that pERK1/2 levels in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) were similar in control and CRH overexpressing mice under basal conditions. Acute stress caused comparably increased levels of corticosterone in both control (CRH-COEcon-Cam) and CRH overexpressing (CRH-COEhom-Cam) animals. CRH-COEhom-Cam mice after stress showed reduced pERK1/2 immunoreactivity in the BLA compared to CRH-COEhom-Cam animals under basal conditions. Radioligand binding and in situ hybridization revealed higher density of CRH-R1 in the amygdala of CRH-COEhom mice under basal conditions compared to control littermates. A significant reduction of the receptor levels was observed in this area after acute stress, suggesting that stress may trigger CRH-R1 internalization/downregulation in these CRH overexpressing mice. Chronic CRH overexpression leads to reduced ERK1/2 activation in response to acute stress in the BLA. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Silberstein, S.; Senin, S.

The active metabolite of prasugrel effectively blocks the platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor and inhibits procoagulant and pro-inflammatory platelet responses	PLATELETS			English	Article						platelet; P2Y(12); prasugrel; clopidogrel; receptor inhibition	P-SELECTIN EXPRESSION; IN-VIVO; MICROPARTICLE FORMATION; P(2T) RECEPTOR; CLOPIDOGREL; AGGREGATION; ANTAGONISTS; ACTIVATION; CD40L; AR-C69931MX	The aim of these studies was to investigate the extent of platelet P2Y(12) receptor inhibition by the thienopyridine active metabolite of prasugrel, R-138727. Blood was taken from healthy volunteers and pre-incubated with R-138727 or cangrelor (AR-C66931MX). Platelet aggregation was assessed in platelet rich plasma (PRP) and whole blood (WB). Vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation, platelet procoagulant activity (annexin V binding and microparticle formation) and calcium mobilisation were measured by flow cytometry. Platelet-leukocyte co-aggregate formation and sCD40L release, both pro-inflammatory responses of platelets, were measured by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. P2Y(12) receptor antagonism was determined using a radioligand binding assay (P-33 2-MeSADP) in resting and stimulated platelets and the effects of clopidogrel administration were also assessed. R-138727 yielded concentration-dependent inhibition of platelet aggregation, VASP phosphorylation inhibition, procoagulant activity and pro-inflammatory responses. In the presence of R-138727 or cangrelor there was increased calcium reuptake following agonist stimulation. R-138727 30 mol/L and cangrelor 1 mol/L completely inhibited P-33 2-MeSADP binding, compared to partial inhibition following clopidogrel administration. Platelet activation and granule secretion did not expose an additional pool of P2Y(12) receptors. Prasugrel's active metabolite effectively blocks the P2Y(12) receptor with the highest concentrations tested yielding complete inhibition of P2Y(12)-mediated amplification of several important platelet responses.

We investigated the prevalence of autoimmune features including antibodies to soluble liver antigen (anti-SLA) determined by Radioligand assay (RLA) in ALF patients. Methods: The prevalence and relationship to the immunoglobulin (Ig) response of NOSA and anti-SLA were determined in 73 ALF patients of different causes. Patients were scored using the revised system for diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). Results: Autoantibodies were present in 23 (32%) patients; 16 had anti-SLA, 6 ANA, 4 ASM and 1 AMA. They were absent in paracetamol-related disease and present in 23 of 53 (43%) of non-paracetamol (NP) cases (p < 0.0003). Two of 16 (13%) with NP drug-induced (NPDI), 9 of 21 (43%) viral and 5 of 16 (31%) cryptogenic cases had anti-SLA. NOSA and anti-SLA were not associated with liver injury severity or outcome. IgM was higher in those with viral disease (p < 0.00001). AIH scores classified 50%r of cryptogenic cases as `probable autoimmune hepatitis'. Conclusions: Autoantibodies are common in ALF; cryptogenic cases have features suggestive of an autoimmune pathogenesis. IgM is elevated in viral cases but infrequently in ALF of other causes.

Activation mechanisms for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein involve direct binding of cAMP	BIOCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						cAMP; cyclic nucleotide; cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; ligand binding; mutation; protein secretion	MUCIN SECRETION; SUBMANDIBULAR CELLS; SUBMUCOSAL GLANDS; CFTR; DOMAIN; LOCALIZATION; EXPRESSION; ANTIBODY; DEFECT; IDENTIFICATION	The CFTR [CF (cystic fibrosis) transmembrane conductance regulator] chloride channel is activated by cyclic nucleotidedependent phosphorylation and ATP binding, but also by nonphosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. Other CFTR functions such as regulation of exocytotic protein secretion are also activated by cyclic nucleotide elevating agents. A soluble protein comprising the first NBD (nucleotide-binding domain) and R-domain of CFTR (NBD1-R) was synthesized to determine directly whether CFTR binds cAMP. An equilibrium radioligand-binding assay was developed, firstly to show that, as for full-length CFTR, the NBD1-R protein bound ATP. Half-maximal displacement of [H-3]ATP by non-radioactive ATP at 3.5 mu M and 3.1 mM was demonstrated. [H-3]cAMP bound to the protein with different affinities from ATP (half-maximal displacement by cAMP at 2.6 and 167 mu M). Introduction of a mutation (T421A) in a motif predicted to be important for cyclic nucleotide binding decreased the higher affinity binding of cAMP to 9.2 mu M. The anti-CFTR antibody (MPNB) that inhibits CFTR-mediated protein secretion also inhibited cAMP binding. Thus binding of cAMP to CFTR is consistent with a role in activation of protein secretion, a process defective in CF gland cells. Furthermore, the binding site may be important in the mechanism by which drugs activate mutant CFTR and correct defective Delta F508-CFTR trafficking.

Identification of differential melanocortin 4 receptor agonist profiles at natively expressed receptors in rat cortical astrocytes and recombinantly expressed receptors in human embryonic kidney cells	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						melanocortin receptor; astrocyte; cyclic AMP accumulation; CREB phosphorylation; intrinsic activity; potency	MELANOCYTE-STIMULATING-HORMONE; AGOUTI-RELATED PROTEIN; MGLU1-ALPHA RECEPTORS; SELECTIVITY; ANTAGONIST; PEPTIDE; MONOPHOSPHATE; NEURONS; BINDING; SYSTEM	Using cAMP accumulation as a functional readout, we pharmacologically characterized the response of native melanocortin receptors in cultured rat astrocytes, and found this response to be mediated by the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R). Melancortin agonists stimulate cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner in both astrocytes and human embryonic kidney cells recombinantly expressing rat MC4R (HEK-rMC41Z), however, the relative potency and intrinsic activity of both small molecule and peptide agonists are reduced in the native system. As such, the small molecules THIQ, NBI-702 and MB243 display 43, 30 and 18% of the maximal response elicited by alpha-MSH in astrocytes. Likewise, the peptides MTII and ACTH display 55 and 72% of the maximal response elicited by a-MSH in these cells. In contrast, all of these compounds elicit full agonist responses with similar intrinsic activity to alpha-MSH in HEK-rMC4R cells. MC4R mRNA was detected in astrocytes, however radioligand binding experiments failed to detect measurable MC4R in astrocyte membranes, in contrast to membranes from HEK-rMC4R cells that display a binding site density of 18.1 +/- 1.5 fmol/mg. We propose that the divergent observations in functional activity between the cell types reflect differences in receptor expression and that caution should be exercised when interpreting agonist activity in over-expression systems for the purposes of drug discovery.

Identification and characterization of binding sites for human urotensin-II in Sprague-Dawley rat renal medulla using quantitative receptor autoradiography	PEPTIDES			English	Article						urotensin-II; UT; autoradiography	PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; DIABETIC-NEPHROPATHY; EXPRESSION; VASOCONSTRICTOR; LOCALIZATION; MELLITUS; LIGAND; CELLS; GPR14	Urotensin-II (U-II), a ligand for the G-protein-coupled receptor UT, has been characterized as the most potent mammalian vasoconstrictor identified to date. Although circulating levels of U-II are altered in lower species (e.g., fish) upon exposure to hypo-osmotic stress, little is known about the actions of this cyclic undecapeptide within the kidney, an organ that plays a pivotal role in the control of cardiovascular homeostasis, influencing both cardiac preload (plasma volume) and after load (peripheral resistance). The present study reports the identification of specific, high affinity [I-125]hU-II binding sites in Sprague-Dawley rat kidney outer medulla by autoradiography and also through membrane radioligand binding (K-d 1.9 +/- 0.9 nM and B-max 408 +/- 47 amol mm(-2) and K-d 1.4 +/- 0.3 nM and B-max 51.3 +/- 7.8 fmol mg(-1) protein, respectively). Differences were observed in the binding characteristics within rat strains. Compared to the Sprague-Dawley, Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rat kidney outer medulla displayed low density < 20 fmol mg(-1) protein and low affinity (> 1 mu M) [I-125]hU-II binding sites. Thus, the relative contribution of specific U-II binding sites to the physiological actions of U-II in the control of cardiorenal homeostasis is worthy of further investigation.

Recently, four splice variants (SVs) of GHRH-R have been described, of which SV1 has the highest structural homology to pGHRH-R and likely plays a role in tumor growth. The aim of this study was to reinvestigate whether human tumors and normal human extrapituitary tissues express the pGHRH-R and to corroborate our previous findings on its SVs. Thus, we developed a real-time PCR method for the detection of the mRNA for the pGHRH-R, its SVs, and the GHRH peptide. Using real-time PCR, Western blotting, and radioligand-binding assays, we detected the mRNA for pGHRH-R and pGHRH-R protein in various human cancer cell lines grown in nude mice and in surgical specimens of human lung cancers. The expression of mRNA for SVs of pGHRH-R and GHRH was likewise found in xenografts of human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, pancreatic cancer, glioblastoma, small-cell lung carcinomas, and in human nonmalignant prostate, liver, lung, kidney, and pituitary. Western blots showed that these normal and malignant human tissues contain SV1 protein and immunoreactive GHRH. Our results demonstrate that some normal human tissues and tumors express mRNA and protein for the pGHRH-R and its splice variants. These findings confirm and extend the concept that GHRH and its receptors play an important role in the pathophysiology of human cancers.

The binding potential for [C-11]raclopride (BPraclo), a radioligand with good specificity for dopamine (DA) receptors of the D-2 type, was measured in the striatum and in three experimental situations: awake, anaesthetised with ketamine (50 mg kg(-1) h(-1); i.m.) and anaesthetised with halothane (1.5%). Non-specific binding was evaluated in the cerebellum. In the striatum of both sides, the BPraclo was unmodified by ketamine anaesthesia when compared with awake animals. In contrast, a large increase in BPraclo was observed under halothane anaesthesia. The non-specific binding of [C-11]raclopride, evaluated in the cerebellum, was also unchanged under ketamine anaesthesia but greatly increased under halothane anaesthesia. To evaluate whether changes in the cerebral blood flow (CBF) resulting from the different experimental situations could be at the root of these discrepancies, injections of [O-15]H2O were performed; measurements revealed a drastically increased CBF under halothane anaesthesia and a slight enhancement under ketamine anaesthesia, when compared with the waking state. These results are the first to be obtained on this topic in awake cats, and show that the BPraclo is greatly dependent on alterations in the CBF.

[H-3]CP-101,606 binds to adult rodent forebrain and NR1/NR2B receptors expressed in HEK 293 cells with K-D=4.2 nM and 6.0 nM, respectively. In contrast, no high affinity specific binding was detected to NR1, NR2A, NR2B subunits expressed alone or NR1/NR2A receptors. HEK 293 cells were transfected with NR1, NR2A and NR2B receptor subunits and complexes comprising all three subunits were isolated by anti-NR2A immunoaffinity chromatography. Based on immunoblotting with subunit-selective antibodies, the immunopurified material contained all three NMDA receptor subunit polypeptides. However, in contrast to parallel studies in which high affinity [H-3]Ro-25,6981 binding activity was observed, no high affinity [H-3]CP-101,606 binding sites were detected to the immunopurified material. This study provides further evidence for two distinct classes of NR2B-directed NMDA receptor antagonists, one which binds with high affinity irrespective whether another NR2 subunit type is present (Ro-25,6981) and a second class which is affected significantly by the presence of another NR2 subunit type within the receptor complex, exemplified by CP-101,606.

Characterization of an MCH specific receptor has been hampered by the lack of a suitable radioligand. The [Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH analog has been shown by different investigators to bind specifically to cell lines of epithelial or pigment cell origin. Recently, using functional assays, the MCH receptor has been characterized as a seven transmembrane G-coupled protein initially identified as SLC-1. in the present study, we used tyrosine iodinated [Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH analog, which stimulates food intake in a manner similar to that of MCH, as well as native MCH to conduct binding studies. Specific binding could not be demonstrated in intact cells of several cell lines, including A431 and B16. Specific binding associated with membranes localized to the microsomal, not the plasma membrane, fraction. Message for SLC-1 was absent in these cell lines, as assessed by Northern blot analysis. We conclude that cells previously reported to express the MCH receptor do not express SLC-I and that both iodinated MCH and the [Phe(13), Tyr(19)]-MCH have a large component of non-specific binding. These ligands may be useful for binding studies in transfected cells with high levels of SLC-I expression. However they do not appear to be suitable for screening for the MCH receptor as most cells demonstrate significant low affinity non-specific binding. (C) 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

The recombinant forms of SLURP-1 produced in E. coli differ in added fusion fragments and in activity. The closest in sequence to the naturally occurring SLURP-1 is the recombinant rSLURP-1, differing by only one additional N-terminal Met residue. sSLURP-1 can be prepared by peptide synthesis and its amino acid sequence is identical to that of the natural protein. In view of recent NMR analysis of the conformational mobility of rSLURP-1 and cryo-electron microscopy structures of complexes of alpha-bungarotoxin (a three-finger snake venom protein) with Torpedo californica and alpha 7 nAChRs, we compared conformations of sSLURP-1 and rSLURP-1 by Raman spectroscopy and CD-controlled thermal denaturation, analyzed their competition with alpha-bungarotoxin for binding to the above-mentioned nAChRs, compared the respective receptor complexes with computer modeling and compared their inhibitory potency on the alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. The CD revealed a higher thermostability of sSLURP-1; some differences between sSLURP-1 and rSLURP-1 were observed in the regions of disulfides and tyrosine residues by Raman spectroscopy, but in binding, computer modeling and electrophysiology, the proteins were similar. Thus, sSLURP-1 and rSLURP-1 with only one additional Met residue appear close in structure and functional characteristics, being appropriate for research on nAChRs.

Therefore, radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, such as DOTATOC, have been introduced for PET imaging of meningiomas. However, the benefit of hybrid SSTR PET/MRI is still debated. Here, we report our experience with [68Ga]-DOTATOC PET/MRI. Methods: PET/MRI was performed in 60 patients with suspected or diagnosed meningiomas of the skull plane and eye socket. Acquired datasets were reported by 2 independent readers regarding local tumor extent and signal characteristics. Histopathologic results and follow-up imaging served as the reference standard. SUVs of target lesions were analyzed according to the corresponding maximal tracer uptake. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/MRI and conventional MRI was determined independently and compared with the reference standard. Results: In total, 60 target lesions were identified, with 54 considered to be meningiomas according to the reference standard. Sensitivity and specificity of PET/MRI versus MRI alone were 95% versus 96% and 75% versus 66%, respectively. The McNemar test was not able to distinguish any differences between PET/MRI and the reference standard or MRI and the reference standard. No differences were found between the 2 modalities with respect to local infiltration. Conclusion: SSTR PET/MRI and MRI yielded similar accuracy for the detection of meningiomas of the skull base and intraorbital space. Here, sequential low-dose SSTR PET/CT might be helpful for the planning of radioligand therapy or radiotherapy.

In the present study, we synthesized and evaluated a series of DIM derivatives and determined their affinities for human CB receptor subtypes in radioligand binding studies. Potent compounds were additionally evaluated in functional cAMP accumulation and beta-arrestin recruitment assays. Small substituents in the 4-position of both indole rings of DIM were beneficial for high CB2 receptor affinity and efficacy. Di-(4-cyano-1H-indol-3-yl)methane (46, PSB-19837, EC50: cAMP, 0.0144 mu M, 95% efficacy compared to the full standard agonist CP55,940; beta-arrestin, 0.0149 mu M, 67% efficacy) was the most potent CB2 receptor agonist of the present series. Di-(4-bromo-1H-indol-3-yl)methane (44, PSB-19571) showed higher potency in beta-arrestin (EC50 0.0450 mu M, 61% efficacy) than in cAMP accumulation assays (EC50 0.509 mu M, 85% efficacy) while 3-((1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-4-methyl-1H-indole (149, PSB-18691) displayed a 19-fold bias for the G protein pathway (EC50: cAMP, 0.0652 mu M; beta-arrestin, 1.08 mu M). DIM and its analogs act as allosteric CB2 receptor agonists. These potent CB2 receptor agonists have potential as novel drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.	[Mahardhika, Andhika B.

Due to the short half-life in blood, small molecules/peptides are rapidly cleared by the circulatory system. Prolonging the half-life of PSMA probes has been considered as an effective strategy to improve the tumor detection. Herein, we reported a Cu-64-labeled PSMA tracer conjugating with maleimidopropionic acid (MPA), Cu-64-PSMA-CM, which showed an excellent ability to detect PSMA-overexpressing tumors in delayed time. Cell experiments in PSMA-positive 22Rv1 cells, human serum albumin binding affinity, and micro-PET imaging studies in 22Rv1 model were performed to investigate the albumin binding capacity and PSMA specificity. Comparisons with Cu-64-PSMA-BCH were performed to explore the influence of MPA on the biological properties. Cu-64-PSMA-CM could be quickly prepared within 30 min. The uptake of Cu-64-PSMA-CM in 22Rv1 cells increased over time and it could bind to HSA with a high protein binding ratio (67.8 +/- 1.5%). When compared to 64 Cu-PSMA-BCH, Cu-64-PSMA-CM demonstrated higher and prolonged accumulation in 22Rv1 tumors, contributing to high tumor-to-organ ratios. These results showed that 64 Cu-PSMA-CM was PSMA specific with a higher tumor uptake, which demonstrated that MPA is an optional strategy for improving the radioactivity concentration in PSMA-expressing tumors and for developing the ligands for PSMA radioligand therapy.

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies with the radiolabeled potent and selective histamine H-3 receptor antagonist [C-11]GSK-189254 in rodents could be used to examine the mechanisms of action of novel therapeutic drugs or to assess changes of regional H-3 receptor density in animal models of neurodegenerative disease. [C-11]GSK-189254 was intravenously administered to healthy Wistar rats (n = 10), and a 60 min dynamic PET scan was carried out. Arterial blood samples were obtained during the scan to generate a metabolite-corrected plasma input function. PET data were analyzed using a one-tissue compartment model (1T2k), irreversible (2T3k) or reversible two-tissue compartment models (2T4k), graphical analysis (Logan and Patlak), reference tissue models (SRTM and SRTM2), and standard uptake values (SUVs). The Akaike information criterion and the standard error of the estimated parameters were used to select the most optimal quantification method. This study demonstrated that the 2T4k model with a fixed blood volume fraction and Logan graphical analysis can best describe the kinetics of [C-11]GSK-189254 in the rat brain. SUV40-60 and the reference tissue-based measurements DVR(2T4k), BPND(SRTM), and SUV ratio could also be used as a simplified method to estimate H-3 receptor availability in case blood sampling is not feasible.

DOTA-JR11 is a SST2 targeting ligand with a five times higher tumor uptake than DOTATATE, and holds promise to improve plaque imaging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of DOTA-JR11 for plaque detection. Methods and Results Atherosclerotic ApoE(-/-) mice (n = 22) fed an atherogenic diet were imaged by SPECT/CT two hours post injection of [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11 (similar to 200 pmol, similar to 50 MBq). In vivo plaque uptake of [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11 was visible in all mice, with a target-to-background-ratio (TBR) of 2.23 +/- 0.35. Post-mortem scans after thymectomy and ex vivo scans of the arteries after excision of the arteries confirmed plaque uptake of the radioligand with TBRs of 2.46 +/- 0.52 and 3.43 +/- 1.45 respectively. Oil red O lipid-staining and ex vivo autoradiography of excised arteries showed [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11 uptake at plaque locations. Histological processing showed CD68 (macrophages) and SST2 expressing cells in plaques. SPECT/CT, in vitro autoradiography and immunohistochemistry performed on slices of a human carotid endarterectomy sample showed [In-111]In-DOTA-JR11 uptake at plaque locations containing CD68 and SST2 expressing cells. Conclusions The results of this study indicate DOTA-JR11 as a promising ligand for visualization of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation.	[Meester, Eric J.; van der Steen, Antonius F.

In order to study the effects of age, sex, and obesity on TSPO binding and to determine whether this binding can be accurately assessed using fewer radio high-performance liquid chromatography (radio-HPLC) measurements of arterial blood samples, we created a database of 48 healthy subjects who had undergone [C-11]PBR28 scans (23 high-affinity binders (HABs) and 25 mixed-affinity binders (MABs), 20 F/28 M, age: 40.6 +/- 16.8 years). After analysis by Logan plot using 23 metabolite-corrected arterial samples, total distribution volume (V-T) was found to be 1.2-fold higher in HABs across all brain regions. Additionally, the polymorphism plot estimated nondisplaceable uptake (V-ND) as 1.40 mL center dot cm(-3), which generated a specific-to-nondisplaceable ratio (BPND) of 1.6 +/- 0.6 in HABs and 1.1 +/- 0.6 in MABs. V-T increased significantly with age in nearly all regions and was well estimated with radio-HPLC measurements from six arterial samples. However, V-T did not correlate with body mass index and was not affected by sex. These results underscore which patient characteristics should be accounted for during [C-11]PBR28 studies and suggest ways to perform such studies more easily and with fewer blood samples.

An increase in cases of whooping cough in adolescents and adults in many countries has been reported, despite high immunization rates in children. To efficiently colonize the host the bacteria have to resist complement, the first defence line of innate immunity. B. pertussis has previously been shown to bind the classical pathway inhibitors C4b-binding protein and C1-inhibitor being thereby able to escape the classical pathway of complement. In this study recent clinical isolates of B. pertussis and B. parapertussis were found to survive alternative pathway attack in fresh non-immune serum better than the reference B. pertussis strain, Tohama I. By using adsorption assays, flow cytometry and a radioligand binding assay we observed that both B. pertussis and B. parapertussis bound the alternative pathway inhibitor factor H (FH) from normal human serum. The surface attached FH maintained its complement regulatory activity and promoted factor I-mediated cleavage of C3b. The main binding region was located to the C-terminal part of FH, into short consensus repeat domains 19-20. In contrast, the avian pathogen B. avium did not bind FH and was sensitive to the alternative pathway of human complement. In conclusion, the human pathogens B. pertussis and B. parapertussis are able to evade the alternative complement pathway by surface acquisition of the host complement regulator FH.

Hybrid Ortho/Allosteric Ligands for the Adenosine A<sub>1</sub> Receptor	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ANTAGONIST BIVALENT LIGANDS; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTORS; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; BINDING-SITES; ADENOSINE-A1-RECEPTOR BINDING; AGONIST BINDING; 2-AMINO-3-BENZOYLTHIOPHENES; ENHANCER; DIMERS	Many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)AR), have been shown to be allosterically modulated by small molecule ligands. So far, in the absence of structural information, the exact location of the allosteric site on the A(1)AR is not known. We synthesized a series of bivalent ligands (4) with an increasing linker length between the orthosteric and allosteric pharmacophores and used these as tools to search for the allosteric site on the A(1)AR. The compounds were tested in both equilibrium radioligand displacement and functional assays in the absence and presence of a reference allosteric enhancer, (2-amino-4,5-dimethy1-3-thienyl)-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanone, PD81,723 (1). Bivalent ligand N-6-[2-amino-3-(3,4-dichlorobenzoyl)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrothieno[2,3-c]-pyridin-6-yl-9-nonyloxy-4-phenyl]-adenosine 4h (LUF6258) with a 9 carbon atom spacer did not show significant changes in affinity or potency in the presence of 1, indicating that this ligand bridged both sites on the receptor. Furthermore, 4h displayed an increase in efficacy, but not potency, compared to the parent, monovalent agonist 2. From molecular modeling studies, we speculate that the allosteric site of the A(1)AR is located in the proximity of the orthosteric site, possibly within the boundaries of the second extracellular loop of the receptor.

Only few take advantage of the intrinsic characteristics of SPECT, particularly those allowing cognitive assessment outside of the camera, in settings close to the standard clinical or laboratory ones. The purpose of the study was to assess the feasibility of a split-dose activation protocol with Tc-99m-HMPAO using low irradiation dose. Materials and methods A two-scans protocol was applied to 12 healthy young volunteers using 270 MBq of Tc-99m-HMPAO per scan, with each image associated to a particular experimental condition of the verbal n-back working memory task (0-back, 2-back). Subtraction method was used to identify regional brain activity related to the task. Results Voxel-wise statistical analysis showed left lateralized activity associated with the 2-back task, compared to the 0-back task. Activated regions, mainly prefrontal and parietal, were similar to those observed in previous fMRI and O-15-PET studies. Conclusion The results support the use of Tc-99m-HMPAO SPECT for the investigation of brain-cognition relations and demonstrate the feasibility of optimal quality images despite low radiopharmaceutical doses. The findings also acknowledge the use of HMPAO as a radioligand to capture neuro-energetic modulations linked to cognitive activity. They encourage extending the application of the described activation protocol to clinical populations.

[3H] RHM-1 was found to have a higher affinity for (T, receptors compared to [H-3]RHM-2 and [H-3]1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine [H-3]DTG). [H-3]RHM-1 had a dissociation constant (Kd of 0.66 +/- 0.12 nM in rat liver membrane homogenates, which was 30-fold higher than that of [3H]RHM-2 (K-d= 19.48 +/- 0.51 nM). The lower affinity of [H-3]RHM-2 can be attributed to its faster K-off rate since both radioligands have similar K., rates. Competitive binding assays were also conducted using a panel of compounds with known affinity for sigma(2), receptors. The pharmacologic profile of [H-3]RHM-1 was in agreement with that of [H-3]DTG. The results of this study indicate that [H-3]RHM-1 is a useful ligand for studying sigma(2) receptors in vitro. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.

N-Alkylation reactions at different positions of uracil derivatives were optimized. Two different methods for xanthine formation from 6-amino-5-cinnamoylaminouracil precursors were investigated, (a) the elimination of water by alkaline catalysis and (b) hexamethyldisilazane as a condensing agent; the latter was found to be superior. The photosensitivity of 8-styrylxanthines was studied. The (E)-configurated stryrylxanthine MSX-2 (8) isomerized in diluted solution, and the resulting (Z)-isomer (10a) was isolated and characterized. Furthermore, we describe for the first time that solid 8-styrylxanthines can dimerize upon exposition to daylight or irradiation with UV light. The resulting cyclobutane derivatives with head-to-tail (syn) configuration exhibited a considerably lower A(2A) adenosine receptor affinity than their parent compounds. The dimerization product of MSX-2 was a moderately potent nonselective A(1) and A(2A) antagonist (K-i(A(1)) = 273 nM, K-i (A(2A)) = 175 nM) while the dimer of the related compound KW-6002 was inactive at A(1) and only weakly active at A(2A) adenosine receptors (K-i = 1.57 muM). The light sensitivity of 8-styrylxanthine derivatives, not only in solution, but also in the solid state, has to be considered when using those compounds as pharmacological tools or drugs.

Therefore, radioiodinated analogues of the non-peptidyl broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor (MMPI) CGS 27023A 1a were synthesized for non-invasive detection of MMP activity in vivo using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The compounds Br-CGS 27023A 1b and HO-CGS 27023A Id were synthesized from the amino acid D-valine and used as precursors for radioiodinated derivatives of CGS 27023A and their non-radioactive references 1-CGS 27023A 1c and HO-I-CGS 27023A 1e. Radioiodination of the precursors with [I-123]NaI or [I-125]NaI produced the no-carrier-added MMP inhibitors [I-123] I-CGS 27023A If [I-125] I-CGS 27023A 1g, HO-[I-123] I-CGS27023A 1h, and HO-[I-125]I-CGS 27023A Ii. In vitro studies showed that the non-radioactive analogues of the MMP inhibitors exhibited affinities against gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) in the nanomolar range, comparable to the parent compound CGS 27023A. hi vivo biodistribution using HO-[I-125] I-CGS 27023A 1i in CL57 B16 mice showed rapid blood and plasma clearance and low retention in normal tissues. The preliminary biological evaluation warrant further studies of these radioiodinated NIMP inhibitors as potential new radiotracers for imaging NIMP activity in vivo. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we characterised the actions of the R-(+)- and S-(-)-enantiomers of etomidate. In mice and tadpoles, R-(+)-etomidate was more potent (similar to10-fold) than S-(-)-etomidate in producing loss of the righting reflex. In electrophysiological and radioligand binding assays, the enantiomers of etomidate positively regulated GABA, receptor function at anaesthetic concentrations and with an enantioselectivity paralleling their in vivo activity. GABA-evoked currents mediated by human recombinant GABA(A) receptors were potentiated by either R-(+)- or S-(-)-etomidate in a manner dependent upon receptor subunit composition. A direct, GABA-mimetic, effect was similarly subunit dependent. Modulation of GABA receptor activity was selective; R-(+)-etomidate inhibited nicotinic acetylcholine, or 5-hydroxytryptamine(3) receptor subtypes only at supra-clinical concentrations and ionotropic glutamate receptor isoforms were essentially unaffected. Acting upon reticulothalamic neurones in rat brain slices, R-(+)-etomidate prolonged the duration of miniature IPSCs and modestly enhanced their peak amplitude. S-(-)-etomidate exerted qualitatively similar, but weaker, actions. In a model of locomotor activity, fictive swimming in Xenopus laevis tadpoles, R-(+)- but not S-(-)-etomidate exerted a depressant influence via enhancement of GABAergic neurotransmission. Collectively, these observations strongly implicate the GABA, receptor as a molecular target relevant to the anaesthetic action of etomidate. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Phylogenetic analysis showed that this receptor is an ortholog of the MC4 subtype, sharing 71% overall amino acid identity with the human (Hsa) MC4 receptor. When expressed and characterized by radioligand binding assay for the natural MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) peptides alpha-, beta-, and gamma-MSH, the SacMC4 receptor showed pharmacological properties very similar to the HsaMC4 receptor. Stimulation of SacMC4 receptor transfected cells with alpha-MSH caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular cAMP levels. The SacMC4 receptor has Ala in position 59 where all other cloned MC receptors have Glu. We confirmed that this was not due to individual polymorphism and subsequently mutated the residue 'back' to Glu but the mutation did not affect the pharmacological properties of the receptor. SacMC4 receptor mRNA was detected by RT-PCR in the optic tectum, hypothalamus, brain stem, telencephalon and olfactory bulb but not in cerebellum or in peripheral tissues. This study describes the first characterization of an MC receptor in a cartilaginous fish, the most distant MC receptor gene cloned to date. Conservation of gene structure, pharmacological properties and tissue distribution suggests that this receptor may have similar roles in sharks as in mammals and that these were established more than 450 million years ago.

Objective To compare EGFR measurement in a panel of cell lines and in breast carcinomas by radioimmunohistochemistry (R-IHC), conventional immunohistochemistry (IHC), and a ligand binding (LB) assay. Design Eight EGFR-expressing cell lines and 50 primary breast carcinoma specimens were analyzed for EGFR by IHC, R-IHC, and LB assays. A further 153 primary breast cancer specimens were analyzed by R-IHC alone. Results All 3 assays were in good agreement for the cell lines. In the subset of the 50 carcinoma specimens, EGFR was detected by LB assays in 19 (38%) and by IHC in 24 (48%). However, R-IHC detected EGFR in 46 (92%) of 50 and in 186 (92%) of all 203 carcinoma specimens. The LB assay agreed poorly with R-IHC of carcinomas, possibly because the LB assay is sensitive to EGFR-expressing nontumor breast parenchyma in the tissue analyzed. Both IHC and R-IHC on carcinoma specimens agreed better, but 26 carcinoma specimens (52%) in which EGFR was not detectable by IHC had a 10-fold range in receptor level detectable by R-IHC. Conclusion To elucidate the role of EGFR or other growth factor receptors in breast cancer requires accurate, sensitive receptor assays. With its dynamic range, R-IHC returned meaningful results over the entire range of expression actually present in breast cancer, which LB assays and IHC failed to do.

The present studies examined the presence of functional expression of CRH receptors in cultured microglia of rat. CRH-R1 mRNA and protein were detected by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), western blotting and receptor chemical cross-linking assay in cultured microglia. CRH-R2 mRNA was undectable by RT-PCR. The radioligand binding analysis using [I-125]Tyr-rat/human CRH revealed a high affinity binding site (K-d of 1.2 nm and B-max of 84 fmol/mg of protein). Competition studies using CRH and related peptides indicated kinetic and pharmacological characteristics consistent with the CRH-R1 receptor subtype. Receptor chemical cross-linking assay demonstrated a single band of CRH receptor with a molecular weight of similar to77 kDa, which was inhibited in the presence of excess unlabeled rat/human CRH in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited by a CRH receptor antagonist astressin. Functional coupled cAMP production in cultured microglia was stimulated by exogenous addition of CRH and related peptides in a dose-dependent manner and blocked by astressin. Our findings suggest the functional expression of CRH-R1 receptor in rat microglia, indicating an important mechanism of interaction between immune and neuroendocrine systems in brain physiological and pathological conditions.

Infusion of (-)-nicotine at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg/24h for 14 days resulted in plasma (-)-nicotine levels of 27.3 ng/mL. This is equivalent to that found in an average human smoker (20 cigarettes a day). In the baboon brain the regional distribution of 5-[I-123]-iodo-A-85380 was consistent with the known densities of nAChRs (thalamus > frontal cortex > cerebellum). Changes in nAChR binding were estimated from the volume of distribution (V-d) and binding potential (BP) derived from 3-compartment model fits. In the (-)-nicotine treated animal V-d was significantly increased in the thalamus (52%) and cerebellum (50%) seven days post cessation of (-)-nicotine treatment, suggesting upregulation of nAChRs. The observed 33% increase in the frontal cortex failed to reach significance. A significant increase in BP was seen in the thalamus. In the saline control animal no changes were observed in V-d or BP under any experimental conditions. In this preliminary study, we have demonstrated for the first time in vivo upregulation of neuronal nAChR binding following chronic (-)-nicotine treatment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Endogenous mu-opioid receptors (MORs) modulate sociability in humans and non-human primates. In this combined PET-fMRI study (n = 17), we tested whether central MOR tone is associated with regional brain responses to social signals of laughter and crying. MOR availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) using the high-affinity agonist radioligand [C-11]carfentanil. Haemodynamic responses to social laughter and crying vocalizations were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Social laughter evoked activation in the auditory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, amygdala, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, and primary and secondary motor cortex; crying sounds led to more restricted activation in the auditory cortex and nearby areas. MOR availability was negatively correlated with the haemodynamic responses to social laughter in the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortex, posterior insula, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, cuneus, temporal gyri and lingual gyrus. For crying-evoked activations, MOR availability was negatively correlated with medial and lateral prefrontal haemodynamic responses. Altogether our findings highlight the role of the MOR system in modulating acute brain responses to both positive and negative social signals.This article is part of the theme issue 'Cracking the laugh code: laughter through the lens of biology, psychology and neuroscience'.

With the appreciation that CB2-selective ligands show marked functional selectivity, there is a renewed opportunity to explore this promising area of research from both a mechanistic as well as a therapeutic perspective. In this research, we are interested in the discovery of new chemotypes as highly selective CB2 modulators, which may serve as good starting points for further optimization towards the development of CB2 therapeutics. In search of new chemotypes as CB2 selective agents, we screened a series of triazole derivatives with interesting bioactive scaffolds, which led to the discovery of two novel and highly selective ligands for CB2 receptors. Compounds 6 and 11 produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of specific [3H]-CP55,940 (CB2) binding with Ki +/- SEM values of 105.3 +/- 22.6 and 116.4 +/- 19.5 nM, respectively, while no binding affinity towards CB1 receptors or opioid receptors was observed. The CB2 functional activity of 6 and 11, as measured by a GPCR Tango assay (G-protein independent b-arrestin translocation assay), revealed that these compounds act as CB2 agonists with EC50 values +/- SEM of 1.83 +/- 0.16 and 1.14 +/- 0.52 mM, respectively.

Dopamine replacement therapy remains the mainstay for attenuation of PD symptoms. Nonetheless, the potential benefit of current pharmacotherapies is mostly limited by adverse side effects, such as drug-induced dyskinesia, motor fluctuations and psychosis. Non-dopaminergic receptors, such as human A(2A) adenosine receptors, have emerged as important therapeutic targets in potentiating therapeutic effects and reducing the unwanted side effects. In this study, new chemical entities targeting both human A(2A) adenosine receptor and dopamine D-2 receptor were designed and evaluated. Two computational methods, namely support vector machine (SVM) models and Tanimoto similarity-based clustering analysis, were integrated for the identification of compounds containing indole- piperazine- pyrimidine (IPP) scaffold. Subsequent synthesis and testing resulted in compounds 5 and 6, which acted as human A(2A) adenosine receptor binders in the radiolig and competition assay (K-i = 8.7-11.2 mu M) as well as human dopamine D-2 receptor binders in the artificial cell membrane assay (EC50 = 22.5-40.2 mu M). Moreover, compound 5 showed improvement in movement and mitigation of the loss of dopaminergic neurons in Drosophila models of PD. Furthermore, in vitro toxicity studies on compounds 5 and 6 did not reveal any mutagenicity (up to 100 mu M), hepatotoxicity (up to 30 mu M) or cardiotoxicity (up to 30 mu M).

Oxytocin is also important for social memory and attachment, human bonding, sexual and maternal behaviour, and aggression. Human disorders characterized by aberrant social interactions, such as autism and schizophrenia, may also involve abnormal oxytocin levels. GSK712043, GSK711320, and GSK664004, three antagonists exhibiting subnanomolar affinity for the human oxytocin receptor (hOTR) and high selectivity over vasopressin receptors were successfully labelled with carbon-11 with suitable yields (0.5-1GBq @EOS), high molar activity (275-700 GBq/mu mol), and radiochemical purities. The in vivo regional uptake of these radiotracers was determined in porcine brain. [C-11]GSK711320 baseline scan showed no significant brain uptake, and limited initial uptake was observed following administration of [C-11]GSK712043 or [C-11]GSK664004. The [C-11]GSK712043 and [C-11]GSK664004 kinetics were slow and peaked at around 2%ID/L at 90 minutes post-injection. For both tracers, the distribution of activity was homogeneous throughout the brain. All the tracers showed high uptake in the pituitary gland, especially [C-11]GSK711320; however, its uptake could not be blocked by pretreatment with the known OTR antagonist, L368,899. In vivo evaluation of these candidates demonstrated that they are not suitable as central OTR PET imaging agents.

Neurotransmitter receptor availability in the rat brain is constant in a 24 hour-period	CHRONOBIOLOGY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						24 hour-period; neuroreceptors; rat; sleep-wake cycle	SLEEP-DEPRIVATION; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS; ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MESSENGER-RNA; ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DOPAMINE; BINDING	Wakefulness and sleep are fundamental characteristics of the brain. We, therefore, hypothesized that transmitter systems contribute to their regulation and will exhibit circadian alterations. We assessed the concentration of various neurotransmitter receptors and transporters including adenosinergic (A(1)AR, A(2A)AR, and ENT1), dopaminergic (D1R, D2R, and DAT), and serotonergic (5-HT2AR) target proteins. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were used and maintained in a 12 h light: 12 h dark cycle (lights on from 07:00 h to 19:00 h). We measured receptor and transporter concentrations in different brain regions, including caudate putamen, basal forebrain, and cortex in 4 hour-intervals over a 24 hour-period using quantitative in vitro autoradiography. Investigated receptors and transporters showed no fluctuations in any of the analyzed regions using one-way ANOVA. Only in the horizontal diagonal band of Broca, the difference of A(1)AR concentration between light and dark phases (t-test) as well as the cosinor analysis of the 24 hour-course were significant, suggesting that this region underlies receptor fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the availability of the investigated neurotransmitter receptors and transporters does not undergo changes in a 24 hour-period. While there are reports on changes in adenosine and dopamine receptors during sleep deprivation, we found no changes in the investigated adenosine, dopamine, and serotonin receptors during regular and undisturbed day-night cycles.

Biochemical and behavioral effects of PDE10A inhibitors: Relationship to target site occupancy	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						PDE10A; Antipsychotic; Conditioned avoidance response; Catalepsy; Radioligand; Occupancy	CYCLIC-NUCLEOTIDE PHOSPHODIESTERASES; INCENTIVE SALIENCE ATTRIBUTION; IN-VIVO; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; THERAPEUTIC APPROACH; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; RECEPTOR OCCUPANCY; 10A INHIBITORS; MICE DEFICIENT; DOUBLE-BLIND	Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitors increase the functionality of striatal medium spiny neurons and produce antipsychotic-like effects in rodents by blocking PDE10A mediated hydrolysis of cAMP and/or cGMP. In the current study, we characterized a radiolabeled PDE10A inhibitor, [H-3]BMS-843496, and developed an ex vivo PDE10 binding autoradiographic assay to explore the relationship between PDE10 binding site occupancy and the observed biochemical and behavioral effects of PDE10 inhibitors in mice. [H-3]BMS-843496 is a potent PDE10A inhibitor with a binding affinity (K-D) of 0.15 nM and a functional selectivity of >100-fold over other PDE subtypes tested. Specific [H-3]BMS-843496 binding sites were dominant in the basal ganglia, especially the striatum, with low to moderate binding in the cortical and hippocampal areas, of the mouse and monkey brain. Systemic administration of PDE10 inhibitors produced a dose- and plasma/brain concentration-dependent increase in PDE10A occupancy measured in the striatum. PDE10A occupancy was positively correlated with striatal pCREB expression levels. PDE10A occupancy was also correlated with antipsychotic-like effects measured using the conditioned avoidance response model; a minimum of similar to 40% occupancy was typically required to achieve efficacy. In contrast, a clear relationship between PDE10A occupancy and catalepsy scores, a potential extrapyramidal symptom readout in rodent, was not evident. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The objective of this pilot study was to use the D3R-preferring radioligand [C-11](+)PHNO to compare receptor availability in groups with and without CD. Methods: Ten medically healthy, non-treatment seeking CD subjects (mean age 41 +/- 8) in early abstinence were compared to 10 healthy control (HC) subjects (mean age 41 +/- 6) with no history of cocaine or illicit substance abuse. Binding potential (BPND), a measure of available receptors, was determined with parametric images, computed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM2) with the cerebellum as the reference region. Results: BPND in CD subjects was higher in D3R-rich areas including the substantia nigra ((SN) 29%; P = 0.03), hypothalamus (28%; P = 0.02) and amygdala (35%; P = 0.03). No between-group differences were observed in the striatum or pallidum. BPND values in the SN (r = +0.83; P = 0.008) and pallidum (r = +0.67; P = 0.03) correlated with years of cocaine use. Conclusions: Between-group differences suggest an important role for dopaminergic transmission in the SN, hypothalamus and amygdala in CD. Such findings also highlight the potential relevance of D3R as a medication development target in CD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was further experimentally confirmed via competition with radioiodinated -bungarotoxin ([I-125]-Bgt) for binding to AChBP of the majority of analyzed compounds. Alkaloids pibocin, varacin and makaluvamines C and G had relatively high affinities (K-i 0.5-1.3 M). With the muscle-type nAChR from Torpedo californica ray and human neuronal 7 nAChR, heterologously expressed in the GH(4)C(1) cell line, no competition with [I-125]-Bgt was detected in four compounds, while the rest showed an inhibition. Makaluvamines (K-i similar to 1.5 M) were the most active compounds, but only makaluvamine G and crambescidine 359 revealed a weak selectivity towards muscle-type nAChR. Rhizochalin, aglycone of rhizochalin, pibocin, makaluvamine G, monanchocidin, crambescidine 359 and aaptamine showed inhibitory activities in electrophysiology experiments on the mouse muscle and human 7 nAChRs, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Thus, our results confirm the utility of the modeling studies on AChBPs in a search for natural compounds with cholinergic activity and demonstrate the presence of the latter in the analyzed marine biological sources.

HIGHER IN VIVO SEROTONIN-1A BINDING IN POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER: A PET STUDY WITH [11C]WAY-100635	DEPRESSION AND ANXIETY			English	Article						posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); serotonin-1A (5-HT1A); positron emission tomography; WAY100635; major depressive disorder	MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; 5-HT1A RECEPTOR-BINDING; 1A BINDING; BRAIN; EXTINCTION; EXPOSURE; AMYGDALA; ANXIETY; HIPPOCAMPUS; EXPRESSION	Background Brain serotonin-1A receptors (5-HT1A) are implicated in anxiety. We compared regional brain 5-HT1A binding in medication-free participants with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and healthy volunteers using fully quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) methods. Methods Twenty patients with DSM-IV PTSD (13 with comorbid major depressive disorder, [MDD]) and 49 healthy volunteers underwent PET imaging with 5-HT1A antagonist radioligand [C-11]WAY100635. Arterial blood sampling provided a metabolite-corrected input function and the concentration of free ligand in plasma (fP) for estimation of regional binding potential, BPF ( = Bavailable / KD). Linear mixed modeling compared BPF between groups across regions of interest (ROIs). Results The PTSD group had higher 5-HT1A BPF across brain ROIs (P = .0006). Post hoc comparisons showed higher 5-HT1A BPF in PTSD in all cortical ROIs (2633%), amygdala (34%), and brainstem raphe nuclei (43%), but not hippocampus. The subgroup of seven PTSD patients without comorbid MDD had higher 5-HT1A BPF compared with healthy volunteers (P = .03). Conclusions This is the first report of higher brainstem and forebrain 5-HT1A binding in vivo in PTSD. The finding is independent of MDD. PTSD and MDD have in common an upregulation of 5-HT1A binding including midbrain autoreceptors that would favor less firing and serotonin release. This abnormality may represent a common biomarker of these stress-associated brain disorders.	[Sullivan, Gregory M.; Ogden, R. Todd; Huang, Yung-yu; Oquendo, Maria A.; Mann, J.

Equilibrium and binding kinetics studies were done. The order of affinity of 12 sigma(1) ligands for binding sites labeled with [H-3](+)-pentazocine correlated well with their order of affinity for sites labeled with [H-3]NE-100, suggesting that both radio-ligands label the same receptor. Phenytoin increased the binding of [H-3](+)-pentazocine, enhancing its affinity (K-D value) for a, receptors and decreasing its dissociation rate from these receptors. The maximal number of receptors (B-max value) labeled with [H-3](+)-pentazoeine was not changed. In contrast, phenytoin decreased the specific binding and maximal number of receptors labeled with [H-3]NE-100, and increased its dissociation rate from a, receptors. The affinity of this radioligand for sigma(1) receptors was not modified. In conclusion, phenytoin behaved as a positive allosteric modulator on the binding of [3 H](+)-pentazocine, whereas it negatively modulated the binding of [H-3]NE-100. These results add evidence in favor of the use of phenytoin in vitro to distinguish between agonists and antagonists of sigma(1) receptors.

The present study characterizes the pharmacological profile of a bivalent morphinan that was shown to be a kappa opioid receptor agonist and a mu opioid receptor agonist/antagonist. MCL-145 [bis(N-cyclobutylmethylmorphinan) fumarate] is related to the morphinan cyclorphan and its N-cyclobutylmethyl derivative MCL-101 [3-hydroxy-N-cyclobutylmethyl morphinan S-(+)-mandelate]. MCL-145 consists of two morphinans connected by a spacer at the 3-hydroxy position. This compound had K-i values of 0.078 and 0.20 nM for the kappa and mu opioid receptors, respectively, using radioligand binding assays as shown by Neumeyer et al. in 2003. In the guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thiotriphosphate) binding assay, MCL-145 produced an E-max value of 80% for the kappa opioid receptor and 42% for the mu opioid receptor. The EC50 values obtained for this compound were 4.3 and 3.1 nM for the kappa and mu opioid receptors, respectively. In vivo MCL-145 produced a full dose-response curve in the 55 degrees C warm water tail-flick test and was equipotent to morphine. The agonist properties of MCL-145 were antagonized by the mu-selective antagonist beta-funaltrexamine and the mu-selective antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. MCL-145 also acted as a mu antagonist, as measured by the inhibition of morphine-induced antinociception.

In the present paper, a new series of triazoloquinoxaline derivatives is described. Most of the new compounds, biologically evaluated in radioligand binding assays at bovine (b) A(1) and A(2A) and at human (h) A(1) and A(3) adenosine receptors, showed high hA(3) adenosine receptor affinity and selectivity. In particular, 2-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,2,4,5-tetrahydro-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxaline-1,4-dione (1), also tested at the hA(2A) ARs, shows the best binding profile with a high hA(3) affinity (K-i = 0.60 nM) and strong selectivity vs hA(1) and vs hA(2A) receptors (both selectivity ratios greater than 16 600). To interpret our experimental results, we decided to theoretically depict the putative transmembrane binding motif of our triazoloquinoxaline analogues on hA(3) receptor. Structure-activity relationships have been explained analyzing the three-dimensional structure of the antagonist-receptor models obtained by molecular docking simulation.

Although the role of catecholamines in the stress has been under keen investigation for many years, the effects of immobilization on this pair of receptors, considering their almost completely opposite actions in the heart, are not yet known. We have studied the effects of short-term immobilization (for 120 min) with different times of decapitation after the end of the immobilization period (0, 3, and 24 h) on MR, BAR (beta(1)-AR and beta(2)-AR using radioligand binding studies), and adenylyl cyclase (AC; using high-pressure liquid chromatography detection of cAMP) in different heart regions (left and right atria with or without cardiac ganglion cells [auriculae], septum, and left and right ventricles). The effects of one immobilization period were first apparent after 24 h. Stress brought about a downregulation of MR and BAR with decrease in AC activity. These effects were regionally specific and were predominantly expressed in the right atria, which is rich in ganglia cells, and in the right ventricles. Our results indicate that stressful stimuli can influence not only BAR, but MR, and that AC activity can also be affected. This finding is in good agreement with our previous hypothesis that parallel changes are possible in the number of this pair of receptors on cell membranes.

In the physiological contraction experiments of jejunum and colon, Ach concentration-dependently increased the force of contraction, and the contractile responses to Ach were not affected by aging. In addition, the true- and pseudo-ChE activities were not significantly changed by aging. The Ach-induced contraction was competitively inhibited by muscarinic M3-selective antagonist hexahydro-sila-difenidolhydrochloride p-fluoroanalog (p-F-HHSiD), suggesting that the contractile responses in the rat jejunum and colon were mediated through M3-cholinoceptor. Age-related changes in muscarinic cholinoceptors of jejunum and colon were determined with the use of specific muscarinic radioligand [H-3]-quinuclidinylbenzilate (QNB). The [H-3]QNB saturation binding experiments revealed that the maximal binding (B-max) was increased only in aged jejunum without changes in K-D values. These results suggest that aging may not attenuate the Ach-induced intestinal contraction via muscarmic M3 receptor, although the expression of muscarinic cholinoceptor is differentially modulated in jejunum and colon.

Since SPET is a more accessible functional imaging modality than PET and, overall, it is more economical, radioligands suitable for this technique are in greater demand. Recently, I-123-5-I-R91150, a radioligand with high selectivity and affinity for 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, was introduced for SPET. This study reports on the whole-body distribution and brain uptake of the selective I-123-5-I-R91150 ligand in four normal dogs. The frontal to cerebellar ratio of uptake in time was determined in three dogs. Time-activity curve of venous blood was determined in one dog. Maximal global brain uptake was found at 10-60 min post-injection. Higher brain uptake was noted in the frontal cortical areas compared to the cerebellum. The frontal-cerebellar ratio reached the highest values at 90-180 min. Reversibility and pharmacological selectivity of ligand binding was demonstrated through displacement and blocking studies with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin. This study demonstrates that the specific 5-HT2A iodinated ligand can be used for imaging and semi-quantification of the 5-HT2A receptors in the canine brain in vivo by using SPET.

Using a radiolabelled brevetoxin (PbTx) binding assay and mouse bioassay guided fractionation, I-CTX was purified by Florisil, Sephadex LH-20 and TSK HW-40S chromatography with good recovery. Isolation to purity was not possible by preparative reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) due to significant losses of toxicity. However, analytical reversed phase HPLC coupled to an electrospray mass spectrometry detector identified a [M + H](+) ion at m/z 1141.58 which co-eluted with activity that displaced [3 H]-PbTx binding to rat brain. This mass corresponded to C-CTX-1, but the fragmentation pattern of I-CTX showed a different ratio of pseudo molecular and product ions. I-CTX was found to elute later than P-CTX-1 but was practically indistinguishable from C-CTX-1 on reversed phase HPLC, while the TSK HW-40S column chromatography differentiated I-CTX from the later eluting C-CTX-1. Taken together, these results indicate that I-CTX is a new ciguatoxin (CTX) responsible for ciguatera caused by reef fish in the Indian Ocean. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gevi, M; Domenici, E				Gevi, M; Domenici, E			A scintillation proximity assay amenable for screening and characterization of DNA gyrase B subunit inhibitors	ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						DNA gyrase; novobiocin; scintillation proximity assay; ligand binding; ATPase	PROTEIN; BINDING; CYCLOTHIALIDINES; FRAGMENTS; COUMARINS	DNA gyrase is the target of coumarin and cyclothialidine antibacterials, which bind to the B subunit of the enzyme (GyrB). Currently available GyrB inhibitors have not been clinically successful, but their high in vitro potency against DNA gyrase has raised interest in the development of novel noncoumarin antibacterials acting at the same site. We report the development of a simple scintillation proximity assay (SPA) for the study of binding interactions between coumarin or noncoumarin antibacterials and GyrB, which prevents the needs of separation steps and can be run in microtiter plate formats. The assay is based on the detection of the binding of a radioligand, [H-3]dihydronovobiocin, to a biotin-labeled 43-kDa fragment of GyrB (biotin-GyrB43), which is captured by streptavidin-coated SPA beads. The typical assay was conducted in 96-well microtiter plates, with final concentration of 10 nM for biotin-GyrB43, 20 nM for [H-3]dihydronovobiocin, and 33 mug of SPA beads/ well. From saturation experiments, an equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) for dihydronovobiocin of 8.10 nM was found. Displacement studies gave 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of 42, 64, and 11 nM for novobiocin, dihydronovobiocin, and the cyclothialidine analogue GR122222X, respectively, consistent with previous findings. The assay was found to be robust to dimethyl sulfoxide up to 5% (v/v) and can be used for high-throughput screens of large chemical collections in the search of novel DNA gyrase inhibitors.

We examined the effects of insulin treatment, started 8 weeks after the induction of diabetes, on the expression and distribution of ET receptors and their respective mRNAs in the rat prostate. The densities, pharmacological properties and distribution of ET receptors in the rat prostate were examined using radioligand receptor binding and autoradiographic studies, and gene expression of ET receptors was evaluated utilizing the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). STZ-injected rats had smaller prostates and reduced serum testosterone levels than control and insulin treated diabetic animals. ET receptor density was shown to be significantly higher in the prostate from diabetic rats than those from either control or insulin treated diabetic animals. The pharmacological profile of prostatic ET receptors was similar in all groups (approximately 80% ETA; 20% ETB subtype). ET receptors were predominantly localized to the prostatic stroma. Induction of diabetes increased the expression of mRNA levels of ETA and ETB receptors, and insulin treatment reversed this upregulation to control levels. These results indicate that (1) ET receptor subtypes are expressed in the rat prostate as transcription and translation products; (2) insulin can normalize the diabetes-induced upregulation in the expression of ET receptors and their respective mRNAs; and (3) diabetes-induced regression of the prostate may involve an alteration in ET receptors.

When administered peripherally to monkeys and humans, IBO is rapidly converted to an o-demethylated metabolite, 12-hydroxyibogamine (NORIBO). We have found in rats that peak blood levels of NORIBO can exceed those of the parent compound, and NORIBO persists in the bloodstream for at least 24 h. Surprisingly few studies have examined the in vivo biological activity of NORIBO. In the present series of experiments, we compared the effects of intravenous (iv) administration of IBO and NORIBO (1 and 10 mg/kg) on unconditioned behaviors, circulating stress hormones, and extracellular levels of dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) in the nucleus accumbens of male rats. IBO caused dose-related increases in tremors and forepaw treading, whereas NORIBO did not. Both IBO and NORIBO produced significant elevations in plasma corticosterone and prolactin, but IBO was more potent as a stimulator of corticosterone secretion. Neither drug affected extracellular DA levels in the nucleus accumbens. However, both IBO and NORIBO increased extracellular 5-HT levels, and NORIBO was more potent in this regard. The present data demonstrate that NORIBO is biologically active and undoubtedly contributes to the in vivo pharmacological profile of IBO in rats. Most importantly, NORIBO appears less likely to produce the adverse effects associated with IBO (i.e., tremors and stress-axis activation), suggesting that the metabolite may be a safer alternative for medication development.

Assessment of a white matter reference region for <SUP>11</SUP>C-UCB-J PET quantification	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Ordered subset expectation maximization reconstruction; positron emission tomography; reference region; synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A; synaptic density	VESICLE PROTEIN 2A; BINDING-SITE; HUMAN BRAIN; RECONSTRUCTION; TRACER; LEVETIRACETAM; SV2A; OSEM; RAT	C-11-UCB-J is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand that has been used in humans for synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) imaging and as a potential synaptic density marker. The centrum semiovale (CS) is a proposed reference region for noninvasive quantification of C-11-UCB-J, due to negligible concentrations of SV2A in this region in baboon brain assessed by in vitro methods. However, in displacement scans with SV2A-specific drug levetiracetam in humans, a decrease in C-11-UCB-J concentration was observed in the CS, consistent with some degree of specific binding. The current study aims to validate the CS as a reference region by (1) optimizing CS region of interest (ROI) to minimize spill-in from gray matter with high radioactivity concentrations; (2) investigating convergence of CS ROI values using ordered subset expectation maximization (OS-EM) reconstruction, and (3) comparing baseline CS volume of distribution (V-T) to nondisplaceable uptake in gray matter, V-ND. Improving ROI definition and increasing OS-EM iterations during reconstruction decreased the difference between CS V-T and V-ND. However, even with these corrections, CS V-T overestimated V-ND by similar to 35-40%. These measures showed significant correlation, suggesting that, though biased, the CS may be a useful estimate of nondisplaceable uptake, allowing for noninvasive quantification for SV2A PET.

Projections from the RVLM to the intermediolateral column of the thoracolumbar spinal cord innervate preganglionic neurons of the sympathetic nervous system causing elevation of blood pressure and heart rate. A large proportion, but not all, of the neurons in the RVLM contain the enzymes necessary for the production of epinephrine and are identified as the C1 cell group. Angiotensin II (Ang II) activates the RVLM acting upon AT(1) receptors. To assess the proportion of AT(1) receptors that are located on C1 neurons in the rat RVLM this study employed an antibody to dopamine-beta-hydroxylase conjugated to saporin, to selectively destroy C1 neurons in the RVLM. Expression of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive neurons in the RVLM was reduced by 57 % in the toxin injected RVLM compared to the contralateral RVLM. In contrast, densitometric analysis of autoradiographic images of I-125-sarcosine(1), isoleucine(8) Ang II binding to AT(1) receptors of the injected side RVLM revealed a small (10 %) reduction in AT(1)-receptor expression compared to the contralateral RVLM. These results suggest that the majority of AT(1) receptors in the rat RVLM are located on non-C1 neurons or glia.

Negative cooperativity across β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor homodimers provides insights into the nature of the secondary low-affinity CGP 12177 β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor binding conformation	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						dissociation; receptor dimerization; GPCR; allosterism	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; BETA-BLOCKERS; IN-VIVO; AGONIST; SITE; VISUALIZATION; DIMERIZATION; RADIOLIGAND; RESIDUES; STATES	At the beta(1)-adrenoceptor, CGP 12177 potently antagonizes agonist responses at the primary high-affinity catecholamine conformation while also exerting agonist effects of its own through a secondary low-affinity conformation. A recent mutagenesis study identified transmembrane region (TM) 4 of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor as key for this low-affinity conformation. Others suggested that TM4 has a role in beta(1)-adrenoceptor oligomerization. Here, assessment of the dissociation rate of a fluorescent analog of CGP 12177 [bordifluoropyrromethane-tetramethylrhodamine-(+/-) CGP 12177 (BODIPY-TMR-CGP)] at the human beta(1)-adrenoceptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells revealed negative cooperative interactions between 2 distinct beta(1)-adrenoceptor conformations. The dissociation rate of 3 nM BODIPY-TMR-CGP was 0.09 +/- 0.01 min(-1) in the absence of competitor ligands, and this was enhanced 2.2- and 2.1-fold in the presence of 1 mu M CGP 12177 and 1 mu M propranolol, respectively. These effects on the BODIPY-TMR-CGP dissociation rate were markedly enhanced in beta(1)-adrenoceptor homodimers constrained by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (9.8- and 9.9-fold for 1 mu M CGP 12177 and 1 mu M propranolol, respectively) and abolished in beta(1)-adrenoceptors containing TM4 mutations vital for the second conformation pharmacology. This study suggests that negative cooperativity across a beta(1)-adrenoceptor homodimer may be responsible for generating the low-affinity pharmacology of the secondary beta(1)-adrenoceptor conformation.

Labelled with the short-lived positron emitter fluorine-18, this structure is today the radioligand of reference for in vivo imaging of microglia activation and neuroinflammatory processes with positron emission tomography. In the present work, an isotopically tritium-labelled version was developed ([H-3]DPA-714), in order to access high resolution in vitro and ex vivo microscopic autoradiography studies, repeated and long-lasting receptor binding studies and in vivo pharmacokinetic determination at late time points. Briefly, DPA-714 as reference, and its 3,5-dibrominated derivative as precursor for labelling, were both prepared from DPA-713 in nonoptimized 32% (two steps) and 10% (three steps) yields, respectively. Reductive debromination using deuterium gas and Pd/C as catalyst in methanol, performed at the micromolar scale, confirmed the regioselective introduction of two deuterium atoms at the meta positions of the phenyl ring. Tritiodebromination was analogously performed using no-carrier tritium gas. HPLC purification provided >96% radiochemically pure [H-3]DPA-714 (7GBq) with a 2.1TBq/mmol specific radioactivity. Interestingly, additional hydrogen-for-tritium exchanges were also observed at the 5-methyl and 7-methyl positions of the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine, opening novel perspectives in the labelling of compounds featuring this heterocyclic core.

Here, we have examined the adrenoceptor (AR) subtype that mediates the glycogenic effect of noradrenaline in chick primary astrocytes by the measurement of glycogen turnover (total 14C incorporation of glucose into glycogen) following noradrenergic activation. Noradrenaline and insulin increased glycogen turnover in a concentration-dependent manner. The effect of noradrenaline was mimicked by stimulation of alpha(2)-ARs (and to a lesser degree by beta(3)-ARs), but not by stimulation of alpha(1)-, beta(1)-, or beta(2)-ARs, and occurred only in astrocytes and not neurons. In chick astrocytes, studies using RT-PCR and radioligand binding showed that alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-AR mRNA and protein were present. alpha(2)-AR- or insulin-mediated glycogen turnover was inhibited by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase inhibitors, and both insulin and clonidine caused phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3 in chick astrocytes. alpha(2)-AR but not insulin-mediated glycogen turnover was inhibited by pertussis toxin pre-treatment indicating involvement of Gi/o proteins. These results show that the increase in glycogen turnover caused by noradrenaline is because of activation of alpha(2)-ARs that increase glycogen turnover in astrocytes utilizing a Gi/o-PI3K pathway.

Antagonist affinity has been measured through radioligand binding experiments with membranes prepared from uterine and airway tissue. MEN16132 inhibited [H-3]bradykinin binding with subnanomolar affinity (pK(i) values 10.4 and 10.1 in the uterus and airways, respectively), and was about 3-fold less potent than icatibant (pK(i) values 10.9 and 10.5). Antagonist potency has been estimated towards bradykinin-induced contractility of uterine and urinary bladder smooth muscle preparations. In these assays MEN16132 (pK(B): 9.7 both in uterus and bladder) was about 10-fold more potent than icatibant [pK(B): 8.8 in uterus, and pK(B) 8.0 in urinary bladder, as from Meini, S., Patacchini, R., Giuliani, S., Lazzeri, M., Turini, D., Maggi, C.A., Lecci, A., 2000a. Characterization of bradykinin B-2 receptor antagonists in human and rat urinary bladder. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 388, 177-182]. Washout experiments conducted in the uterine preparation indicated for MEN16132 (100 nM) a slower reversibility than icatibant (300 nM). Altogether present results indicate that MEN16132 displays high affinity and potency also for the rat bradykinin B-2 receptor, and thus is suitable for further investigations in pathophysiological models in this species.

Brain monoamine oxidase a activity predicts trait aggression	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						MAOA; aggression; violence; personality; clorgyline; human	MAO-A; NEURAL MECHANISMS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; GENE PROMOTER; FOLLOW-UP; BEHAVIOR; SEROTONIN; VIOLENCE; MICE; PET	The genetic deletion of monoamine oxidaseA(MAOA), an enzyme that breaks down the monoamine neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine, produces aggressive phenotypes across species. Therefore, a common polymorphism in the MAO A gene (MAOA, Mendelian Inheritance in Men database number 309850, referred to as high or low based on transcription in non-neuronal cells) has been investigated in a number of externalizing behavioral and clinical phenotypes. These studies provide evidence linking the low MAOA genotype and violent behavior but only through interaction with severe environmental stressors during childhood. Here, we hypothesized that in healthy adult males the gene product of MAO A in the brain, rather than the gene per se, would be associated with regulating the concentration of brain amines involved in trait aggression. Brain MAO A activity was measured in vivo in healthy nonsmoking men with positron emission tomography using a radioligand specific for MAO A (clorgyline labeled with carbon 11). Trait aggression was measured with the multidimensional personality questionnaire (MPQ). Here we report for the first time that brain MAO A correlates inversely with the MPQ trait measure of aggression ( but not with other personality traits) such that the lower the MAO A activity in cortical and subcortical brain regions, the higher the self-reported aggression ( in both MAOA genotype groups) contributing to more than one-third of the variability. Because trait aggression is a measure used to predict antisocial behavior, these results underscore the relevance of MAO A as a neurochemical substrate of aberrant aggression.

Mefloquine-induced disruption of calcium homeostasis in mammalian cells is similar to that induced by ionomycin	ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article							ANTIMALARIAL-DRUG MEFLOQUINE; TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; CEREBRAL UPTAKE; CA2+ INFLUX; IN-VITRO; RAT; RECEPTORS; IONOPHORE; BILAYERS; ENTRY	In previous studies, we have shown that mefloquine disrupts calcium homeostasis in neurons by depletion of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores, followed by an influx of external calcium across the plasma membrane. In this study, we explore two hypotheses concerning the mechanism(s) of action of mefloquine. First, we investigated the possibility that mefloquine activates non-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors and the inositol phosphate 3 (IP3) signaling cascade leading to ER calcium release. Second, we compared the disruptive effects of mefloquine on calcium homeostasis to those of ionomycin in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. Ionomycin is known to discharge the ER calcium store (through an undefined mechanism), which induces capacitative calcium entry (CCE). In radioligand binding assays, mefloquine showed no affinity for the known binding sites of several glutamate receptor subtypes. The pattern of neuroprotection induced by a panel of glutamate receptor antagonists was dissimilar to that of mefloquine. Both mefloquine and ionomycin exhibited dose-related and qualitatively similar disruptions of calcium homeostasis in both neurons and macrophages. The influx of external calcium was blocked by the inhibitors of CCE in a dose-related fashion. Both mefloquine and ionomycin upregulated the IP3 pathway in a manner that we interpret to be secondary to CCE. Collectively, these data suggest that mefloquine does not activate glutamate receptors and that it disrupts calcium homeostasis in mammalian cells in a manner similar to that of ionomycin.

In radioligand binding experiments with [H-3]clonidine and [H-3]lysophosphatidic acid on intact, alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-deficient PC12 cells, moxonidine, clonidine, lysophosphatidic acid and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) competed for the specific binding sites of both radioligands with similar affinities. RNA interference with the rat S1P(1)-, S1P(2)- or S1P(3)-rcceptor abolished specific [H-3]lysophosphatidic acid binding. [H-3]Clonidine binding was markedly decreased by siRNA targeting S1P(1)- and S1P(3)-receptors but not by siRNA against S1P(2)-receptors. Finally, in HEK293 cells transiently expressing human S1P(3)-receptors, sphingosine-1-phosphate, clonidine and moxonidine induced increases in intracellular calcium concentration, moxonidine being more potent than clonidine; this is in agreement with the known properties of the "I-1-imidazoline receptors". The present results indicate that the "I-1-imidazoline receptors" mediating effects of clonidine and moxonidine in PC12 and the transfected HEK293 cells belong to the SIP-receptor family; in particular, the data obtained in PC12 cells suggest that the 11 imidazoline receptors represent a mixture of S1P(1)- and S1P(3)-receptors and/or hetero-dimers of both.

Additionally, such guanidines are histamine H, receptor (H,R) antagonists with preference for the human relative to the guinea pig receptor. The purpose of this study was to examine structure-activity relationships of guanidines at human and guinea pig H1R and H2R species isoforms expressed in Sf9 insect cells. Three impromidine analogues and six arpromidine analogues exhibited agonistic activity at H2R and antagonistic activity at H,R as assessed in the steady-state GTPase assay. Species selectivity of derivatives was similar as compared with the parent compounds. None of the structural modifications examined (different aromatic ring systems and different ring substituents) was superior in terms of H,R potency and efficacy relative to impromidine and arpromidine, respectively. These data point to substantial structural constraints at the agonist binding site of H2R. Guanidines exhibited distinct structure-activity relationships for H,R antagonism in a radioligand competition binding assay and the GTPase assay and for H,R inverse agonism. Our data indicate that it is difficult to obtain guanidine-type agonists with high potency and high efficacy for hH(2)R, but those compounds may be useful tools for exploring the antagonist binding site and constitutive activity of H,R.

A central feature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is inflammation coexisting with an abnormal protease/antiprotease balance, leading to apoptosis and elastolysis. In an in vitro study of rat lung alveolar L2 cells, cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induced apoptotic cell death. Exposure of L2 cells to CSE at a concentration of 0.25% resulted in a 50% increase of caspase-3 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activities. Specific inhibitors for caspases and MMPs attenuated the cytotoxicity of CSE. RT-PCR amplification identified VPAC2 receptors in L2 cells. A radioligand-binding assay with I-125-labeled vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) found high affinity and saturable I-125-labeled VIP-binding sites in L2 cells. VIP and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP27) were approximately equipotent for both VIP receptor binding and stimulation of cAMP production in L2 cells. Both neuropeptides, at concentrations higher than 10(-13) m, produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CSE-induced cell death in L2 cells. VIP, at 10(-7) m, reduced CSE-stimulated MMP activity and caspase-3 activation. The present study has shown that VIP and PACAP27 significantly attenuate the cytotoxicity of CSE through the activation of VPAC2 receptor, and the protective effect of VIP may partly be the result of a reduction in the CSE-induced stimulation of MMPs and caspases.

We compared the ability of four dual transporter inhibitors-chlorimipramine, duloxetine, milnacipran and venlafaxine-to block monoamine transporters in vitro and in vivo and increase extracellular monoamines in rat brain. Inhibition of radioligand binding to clonal human monoamine transporters in vitro and in vivo in rats was determined. Extracellular concentrations of 5-HT and NE in rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) were quantified using the microdialysis technique. All compounds blocked binding to human 5-HT and NE transporters, although chlorimipramine and venlafaxine had markedly greater affinity for 5-HT than NE transporters. In vivo, chlorimipramine and duloxetine potently blocked both transporters, milnacipran blocked both with lower potency and venlafaxine only blocked the 5-HT transporter. Chlorimipramine and duloxetine increased robustly and approximately equally monoamine extracellular concentrations. Milnacipran produced only small increases in NE, whereas venlafaxine increased 5-HT markedly at the lower doses and both monoamines at high doses. Thus, the dual transporter inhibitors blocked 5-HT and NE transporters in vitro and in vivo with varying potency. Chlorimipramine, duloxetine, and high dose venlafaxine acted as dual transporter inhibitors in rat PFC and increased extracellular concentrations of the monoamines, indicating functional dual transporter inhibition.

In this work we demonstrate circulating autoantibodies against neonatal heart M-1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) in the sera of children with congenital heart block. This antibody were able to react with the second extracellular loop of the human M-1 mAChR as demonstrated using a synthetic peptide in enzyme immune assay and binding assay. Affinity purified anti-peptide IgG as well as total IgG from children with congenital heart block, interfered with the specific radioligand occupancy from neonatal heart M-1 mAChR, interacting irreversibly. The antipeptide antibodies also displayed an 'agonist-like' activity, i.e. decreased contractility, activated nitric oxide synthase activity and increased production of cyclic GMP. All of these effects were selectively blunted by pirenzepine and neutralized by the synthetic M-1 peptide. Both binding and biological effects were obtained using neonatal rat heart instead adult heart and were independent of Ro/SS-A and La/SS-B antibodies and were also absent in the sera of normal children. A clinical relevance of these findings is demonstrated by a strong association between the existence of circulating M-1 mAChR antipeptide antibodies and the presence of isolated congenital heart block, making these antibodies a proper marker of this disease.

In the normal human prostate, Ang II receptors were of the AT(1) subtype and localized predominantly to periurethral stromal smooth muscle. The AT(1) receptor antagonist losartan totally displaced specific [I-125]-[Sar(1),Ile(8)]Ang II binding. in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319 was without effect. There was no significant difference in receptor affinity, but AT(1) receptor density was markedly reduced in BPH compared with that in normal prostate. In rat prostate, Ang II(0.01-1 muM produced a concentration-dependent increase in [H-3]-noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves. The findings of the present study suggest that angiotensin AT(1) receptors predominate in the human prostate. The high concentration of AT(1) receptors in the periurethral region suggests a role for Ang II in modulating cell growth, smooth muscle tone, and possibly micturition. Furthermore, downregulation of AT(1) receptors in BPH may be due to receptor hyperstimulation by increased local levels of Ang II in BPH. Finally, Ang II may play a functional role in modulating sympathetic transmission in the prostate. These data support the novel concept that activation of the renin-angiotensin system may be involved in the pathophysiology of BPH.

J	Lansdell, SJ; Millar, NS				Lansdell, SJ; Millar, NS			Cloning and heterologous expression of Dα4, a <i>Drosophila</i> neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit:: identification of an alternative exon influencing the efficiency of subunit assembly	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						alternative splicing; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; subunit assembly	CONSERVED DISULFIDE LOOP; ALPHA-SUBUNITS; MYZUS-PERSICAE; SEQUENCE; MELANOGASTER; TEMPERATURE; DIVERSITY; PROTEIN; SITES	A neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit, D alpha4, has been identified and cloned from the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, together with several alternatively spliced transcripts. Intron-exon boundaries within the gene encoding D alpha4 (nAcRalpha-80B) have been identified by comparison of cDNA and genomic sequence data. The influence of amino acids encoded by alternatively spliced exons upon nicotinic radioligand binding and subunit-subunit co-assembly has been examined by heterologous expression in Drosophila S2 cells. The efficiency of subunit assembly has been shown to be influenced by amino acids surrounding the highly conserved 15 amino acid cysteine-loop motif within the N-terminal extracellular domain of the nAChR D alpha4 subunit. Extensive use has been made of publicly available data determined by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (BDGP). This includes expressed sequence tag (EST) data as well as whole-embryo in situ hybridisation and polytene chromosome in situ hybridisation data. BDGP in situ hybridisation data suggests that the D alpha4 mRNA is expressed within Drosophila brain and ventral nerve cord and demonstrates that the gene encoding this nAChR subunit is located at position 80B on chromosome 3. The relationship between D alpha4 and other previously cloned nAChR subunits has been examined and the implications for the nomenclature of insect nAChRs is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Functional gains in energy and cell metabolism after <i>TSPO</i> gene insertion	CELL CYCLE			English	Article						cell metabolism; energy production; mitochondria; patch clamp; TSPO	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN GLIOBLASTOMA CELLS; LOCATION-DEPENDENT ROLE; 18 KDA; IN-VIVO; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; BINDING-PROPERTIES	Recent loss-of-function studies in tissue-specific as well as global Tspo (Translocator Protein 18 kDa) knockout mice have not confirmed its long assumed indispensability for the translocation of cholesterol across the mitochondrial inter-membrane space, a rate-limiting step in steroid biosynthesis. Instead, recent studies in global Tspo knockout mice indicate that TSPO may play a more fundamental role in cellular bioenergetics, which may include the indirect down-stream regulation of transport or metabolic functions. To examine whether overexpression of the TSPO protein alters the cellular bioenergetic profile, Jurkat cells with low to absent endogenous expression were transfected with a TSPO construct to create a stable cell line with de novo expression of exogenous TSPO protein. Expression of TSPO was confirmed by RT-qPCR, radioligand binding with [3H]PK11195 and immunocytochemistry with a TSPO antibody. We demonstrate that TSPO gene insertion causes increased transcription of genes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Furthermore, TSPO insertion increased mitochondrial ATP production as well as cell excitability, reflected in a decrease in patch clamp recorded rectified K channel currents. These functional changes were accompanied by an increase in cell proliferation and motility, which were inhibited by PK11195, a selective ligand for TSPO. We suggest that TSPO may serve a range of functions that can be viewed as downstream regulatory effects of its primary, evolutionary conserved role in cell metabolism and energy production.

Examining the Effects of Sodium Ions on the Binding of Antagonists to Dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and D<sub>3</sub> Receptors	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; SITE CREVICE; AGONIST; D2; SENSITIVITY; DISORDERS; PLATELETS; MEMBRANE; AFFINITY	Many G protein-coupled receptors have been shown to be sensitive to the presence of sodium ions (Na+). Using radioligand competition binding assays, we have examined and compared the effects of sodium ions on the binding affinities of a number of structurally diverse ligands at human dopamine D-2 and dopamine D-3 receptor subtypes, which are important therapeutic targets for the treatment of psychotic disorders. At both receptors, the binding affinities of the antagonists/inverse agonists SB-277011-A, L, 741,626, GR 103691 and U 99194 were higher in the presence of sodium ions compared to those measured in the presence of the organic cation, N-methyl-D-glucamine, used to control for ionic strength. Conversely, the affinities of spiperone and (+)-butaclamol were unaffected by the presence of sodium ions. Interestingly, the binding of the antagonist/inverse agonist clozapine was affected by changes in ionic strength of the buffer used rather than the presence of specific cations. Similar sensitivities to sodium ions were seen at both receptors, suggesting parallel effects of sodium ion interactions on receptor conformation. However, no clear correlation between ligand characteristics, such as subtype selectivity, and sodium ion sensitivity were observed. Therefore, the properties which determine this sensitivity remain unclear. However these findings do highlight the importance of careful consideration of assay buffer composition for in vitro assays and when comparing data from different studies, and may indicate a further level of control for ligand binding in vivo.

Imaging robust microglial activation after lipopolysaccharide administration in humans with PET	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						neuroinflammation; PBR28; endotoxin; microglia; cytokines	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PROTEIN 18 KDA; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; VIVO RADIOLIGAND BINDING; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; IN-VIVO; SYSTEMIC INFLAMMATION; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; NEUROINFLAMMATION	Neuroinflammation is associated with a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases. The core process in neuroinflammation is activation of microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain. We measured the neuroinflammatory response produced by a systemic administration of the Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS; also called endotoxin) in humans with the positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer [C-11]PBR28, which binds to translocator protein, a molecular marker that is up-regulated by microglial activation. In addition, inflammatory cytokines in serum and sickness behavior profiles were measured before and after LPS administration to relate brain microglial activation with systemic inflammation and behavior. Eight healthy male subjects each had two 120-min [C-11]PBR28 PET scans in 1 d, before and after an LPS challenge. LPS (1.0 ng/kg, i.v.) was administered 180 min before the second [C-11]PBR28 scan. LPS administration significantly increased [C-11]PBR28 binding 30-60%, demonstrating microglial activation throughout the brain. This increase was accompanied by an increase in blood levels of inflammatory cytokines, vital sign changes, and sickness symptoms, well-established consequences of LPS administration. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in humans that a systemic LPS challenge induces robust increases in microglial activation in the brain. This imaging paradigm to measure brain microglial activation with [C-11]PBR28 PET provides an approach to test new medications in humans for their putative antiinflammatory effects.

The purpose of this first-in-human study was to determine the optimal kinetic model for analysis of C-11-LY2795050 imaging data. Sixteen subjects underwent baseline scans and blocking scans after oral naltrexone. Compartmental modeling and multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) were applied using the arterial input functions. Two-tissue compartment model and MA1 were found to be the best models to provide reliable measures of binding parameters. The rank order of C-11-LY2795050 distribution volume (V-T) matched the known regional KOR densities in the human brain. Blocking scans with naltrexone indicated no ideal reference region for C-11-LY2795050. Three methods for calculation of the nondisplaceable distribution volume (V-ND) were assessed: (1) individual V-ND estimated from naltrexone occupancy plots, (2) mean V-ND across subjects, and (3) a fixed fraction of cerebellum V-T. Approach (3) produced the lowest intersubject variability in the calculation of binding potentials (BPND, BPF, and BPP). Therefore, binding potentials of C-11-LY2795050 can be determined if the specific binding fraction in the cerebellum is presumed to be unchanged by diseases and experimental conditions. In conclusion, results from the present study show the suitability of C-11-LY2795050 to image and quantify KOR in humans.

This radioligand achieved the basic requirements for NET imaging. In this study, we assessed the potential of radioiodinated (S,S)-IPBM as an imaging biomarker of NET to obtain diagnostic information about depression in relation to NET expression in the brain using a rat depression model. The ex vivo autoradiographic experiments using the (S,S)[[I-125]IPBM showed significantly lower accumulation of radioactivity in the locus coeruleus (LC) and the anteroventricular thalamic nucleus (AVTN) of the depression group than in those of the control group. Consequently, in vitro autoradiographic experiments showed that NET maximum binding (B-max) values in the LC and AVTN, known as NET-rich regions, were significantly decreased in the rat model of depression when compared to those of the control rats. In addition, there was an extremely good correlation between NET B-max and (S,S)-IPBM accumulation (r = .98), an indication of radioiodinated IPBM as a quantitative NET imaging biomarker. The reduction in (S,S)-[I-125]IPBM accumulation in the rat model of depression correlated with that of NET density. These results suggest that (S,S)-[I-123]IPBM has potential as an imaging biomarker of NET to obtain diagnostic information about major depression.

Ca2+ influx results indicate that these compounds are not agonists of the human (h) alpha 4 beta 2, alpha 3 beta 4, alpha 7, and alpha 1 beta 1 gamma delta AChRs; compounds 2-4 are specific positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of h alpha 7 AChRs, whereas compounds 1-4, 7, and 12 are noncompetitive antagonists of the other AChRs. Radioligand binding results indicate that PAMs do not inhibit binding of [H-3]methyllycaconitine but enhance binding of [H-3]epibatidine to h alpha 7 AChRs, indicating that these compounds do not directly, but allosterically, interact with the h alpha 7 agonist sites. Additional competition binding results indicate that the antagonistic action mediated by these compounds is produced by direct interaction with neither the phencyclidine site in the Torpedo AChR ion channel nor the imipramine and the agonist sites in the h alpha 4 beta 2 and h alpha 3 beta 4 AChRs. Molecular dynamics and docking results suggest that the binding site for compounds 2-4 is mainly located in the inner beta-sheet of the h alpha 7-alpha 7 interface, similar to 12 angstrom from the agonist locus. Hydrogen bond interactions between the amide group of the PAMs and the h alpha 7 AChR binding site are found to be critical for their activity. The dual PAM and antagonistic activities elicited by compounds 2-4 might be therapeutically important.

Biodistribution, specificity and selectivity of the radiotracers were studied ex vivo in rats pre-treated with specific antagonists for DAT, serotonin transporter (SERT) and noradrenalin transporter (NET) and in control rats. Positron emission tomography (PET) studies were performed using an HRRT scanner. Radiolabelled metabolites were analyzed with thin-layer chromatography. [F-18]beta-CFT showed slow kinetics with a maximum striatum/cerebellum uptake ratio of 9.2 at 120 min. [F-18]beta-CFT-FP showed fast kinetics with a maximum ratio of 3.1 at 5 min. Both tracers bound to DAT. [F-18]beta-CFT also bound to NET. [F-18]beta-CFT was more resistant to metabolism than [F-18]beta-CFT-FP. Structural modifications of [F-18]beta-CFT significantly changed its biological properties, as shown by [F-18]beta-CFT-FP. [F-18]beta-CFT is a suitable tracer for both preclinical and human PET studies, but [F-18]beta-CFT-FP is less suitable as a PET tracer.

The purpose of this study was to explore the premortem diagnostic utility of C-11-PiB PET in sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Methods: Two patients, 72 and 59 years old, underwent evaluation for rapidly progressive cognitive decline, dying after illness durations of 5 and 7 months, respectively. As part of their comprehensive assessment, F-18-FDG PET and C-11-PiB PET studies were performed approximately 2-4 weeks prior to death, and the brain regional distributions compared with those from cohorts of healthy controls (HC) and AD patients. Results: Routine investigations, including brain MRI scans, revealed changes typical of sporadic CJD, with the diagnosis confirmed at autopsy in both patients. The F-18-FDG PET showed global hypometabolism in one patient and thalamic and frontal hypometabolism with unexpected hypermetabolism in the dentate nuclei of the cerebellum in the other. Neither patient displayed cerebral cortical C-11-PiB PET retention above the levels observed in HC. Conclusions: No grey-matter C-11-PiB retention was observed in two pathologically confirmed cases of typical sporadic CJD. We speculate that low PrP plaque density and small plaque size, as well as a relatively low affinity of the radioligand, explain the absence of C-11-PiB retention. More studies to validate this hypothesis are warranted.	[Villemagne, V. L.; Jones, G.; Baxendale, D.; Rowe, C. C.] Austin Hlth, Dept Nucl Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Villemagne, V.

Longitudinal epitope analysis of insulin-binding antibodies in type 1 diabetes	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						epitopes; insulin autoantibody; radioligand binding assay; recombinant Fab; type 1 diabetes	MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; AUTOANTIBODIES; PARENTS; RISK; AUTOIMMUNITY; PREDICTION; CHILDHOOD; RELATIVES; CHILDREN	Autoantibodies to insulin (IAA) are one of the first markers of the autoimmune process leading to type 1 diabetes (T1D). While other autoantibodies in T1D have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about IAA and their binding specificities, especially after insulin treatment is initiated. We hypothesize that insulin antibodies (IA) that develop upon initiation of insulin treatment differ in their epitope specificities from IAA. We analysed insulin antibody binding specificities in longitudinal samples of T1D patients (n = 49). Samples were taken at clinical diagnosis of disease and after insulin treatment was initiated. The epitope specificities were analysed using recombinant Fab (rFab) derived from insulin-specific monoclonal antibodies AE9D6 and CG7C7. Binding of radiolabelled insulin by samples taken at onset of the disease was significantly reduced in the presence of rFab CG7C7 and AE9D6. rFab AE9D6 competed sera binding to insulin significantly better than rFab CG7C7 (P = 0.02). Binding to the AE9D6-defined epitope in the initial sample was correlated inversely with age at onset (P = 0.005). The binding to the AE9D6-defined epitope increased significantly (P < 0.0001) after 3 months of insulin treatment. Binding to the CG7C7-defined epitope did not change during the analysed period of 12 months. We conclude that epitopes recognized by insulin binding antibodies can be identified using monoclonal insulin-specific rFab as competitors. Using this approach we observed that insulin treatment is accompanied by a change in epitope specificities in the emerging IA.

We sought to determine the possible mechanism for the lipid-lowering actions of imidazolines in a model of metabolic Syndrome X, the spontaneously-hypertensive obese (SHROB) rat. The acute actions of moxonidine and rilmenidine, selective I1R agonists, were compared to a specific alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist, guanabenz, with and without selective receptor blockers. Moxonidine and rilmenidine rapidly reduced plasma triglyceride (20 +/- 4% and 21 +/- 5%, respectively) and cholesterol (29 +/- 9% and 27 +/- 9%). In contrast, the specific alpha(2)-adrenergic receptor agonist guanabenz failed to reduce plasma lipids. Blocking experiments showed that moxonidine's actions were mediated by I1R and not alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. To evaluate a hepatic site of action, radioligand binding studies with liver plasma membranes confirmed the presence of I1R. Intraportal moxonidine reduced plasma triglycerides by 23 +/- 3% within 10 min. Moxonidine inhibited hepatic triglyceride secretion by 75% compared to vehicle treatment. Tracer studies with (H2O)-H-2 suggested that moxonidine inhibits de novo fatty acid synthesis. Thus, activation of I1R lowers plasma lipids, with the main site of action probably within the liver to reduce synthesis and secretion of triglycerides. More selective I1R agonists might provide monotherapy for hyperlipidemic hypertension.

J	Yang, K; Zuckerman, A; Pasternak, GW				Yang, K; Zuckerman, A; Pasternak, GW			Affinity labeling mu opioid receptors with novel radioligands	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						MOR-1; MOP; affinity label; opiate	PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; ALKYLATING AGENT; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MOLECULAR-CLONING; OPIATE RECEPTOR; CDNA CLONING; RAT-BRAIN; KAPPA; BINDING; CHLORNALTREXAMINE	1. A series of novel opiate ligands based upon 6 alpha-naloxamine have been examined in opioid receptor binding assays. 2. Coupling an ethylamine spacer alone to 6-alpha-naloxamine gave a compound with relatively poor affinity for mu opioid receptors compared to naloxone, although it retained high affinity for kappa, opioid receptors. Coupling a benzoyl group significantly increased the affinity. The presence at the 4-position of the benzoyl moiety of an amino-(NalAmiBen) or an azido-substituent (NalAziBen) did not significantly effect the affinity at mu receptors. However, iodinating the benzoyl moiety at the 3-position increased the affinity of the derivatives. 3. Two compounds were radiolabeled and evaluated in receptor binding assays. Both radioligands labeled Sites in CHO cells stably transfected with the mouse MOR-1 clone. The amino coupound [I-125]Na]AniiBen and the azido derivative [I-125]NalAziBen reversibly bound to membranes from CHO cells transfected with MOR-1 with high affinity in the dark. Exposure of [I-125]NaIAmiBen to UV did not alter the reversibility of binding, but exposure of [I-125]NalAziBen to UV light led to the covalent coupling of the radioligand to the receptor. When run on SDS-PAGE, [I-125]NalAziBen binding showed a band at approximately 70-80 kDa. A control corresponding to nonspecific binding failed to reveal any labeling. No bands were observed from membranes labeled with [I-125]NalAmiBen.

J	Neish, CS; Martin, IL; Davies, M; Henderson, RM; Edwardson, JM				Neish, CS; Martin, IL; Davies, M; Henderson, RM; Edwardson, JM			Atomic force microscopy of ionotropic receptors bearing subunit-specific tags provides a method for determining receptor architecture	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							BENZODIAZEPINE BINDING-SITE; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; AMINOBUTYRIC ACID(A) RECEPTORS; RECOMBINANT GABA(A) RECEPTOR; A RECEPTORS; DIRECT VISUALIZATION; POINT MUTATIONS; CHANNEL; STOICHIOMETRY; PHARMACOLOGY	We have developed an atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based method for the determination of the subunit architecture of ionotropic receptors, and tested the method using the GABA(A) receptor as a model system. The most common form of the GABA(A) receptor probably consists of 2alpha(1)-, 2beta(2)- and 1gamma(2)-subunits. We show here that the arrangement of subunits around the central Cl- ion channel can be deduced by AFM of receptors tagged with subunit-specific antibodies. Transfection of cells with DNA encoding alpha(1)-, beta(2)- and gamma(2)-subunits resulted in the production of receptors containing all three subunits, as judged by both immunoblot analysis and the binding of [H-3]-Ro15-1788, a specific radioligand for the GABA(A) receptor. A His(6)-tag on the alpha(1)-subunit was used to purify the receptor from membrane fractions of transfected cells. After incubation with anti-His(6) immunoglobulin G, some receptors became tagged with either one or two antibody molecules. AFM analysis of complexes containing two bound antibodies showed that the most common angle between the two tags was 135degrees, close to the value of 144degrees expected if the two alpha-subunits are separated by a third subunit. This method is applicable to the complete elucidation of the subunit arrangement around the GABAA receptor rosette, and can also be applied to other ionotropic receptors.

In this study, we have characterized alpha-adrenergic receptors (AR) in rabbit vagina by assessment of radioligand binding, contractility of isolated tissue strips and genital hemodynamics. [H-3]Prazosin and [H-3]RX821002 (alpha-1 and alpha-2 AR selective antagonists) bound to rabbit vaginal membrane preparations with high affinity and limited capacity. Competition binding assays using both non-selective and subtype selective ligands for AR (phentolamine, prazosin, delequamine, rauwolscine and UK14304) further confirmed the presence of alpha-1 and alpha-2 AR in vaginal tissue. In organ bath preparations of vaginal tissue strips, norepinephrine-induced contraction was attenuated by alpha-1 and alpha-2 AR antagonists (prazosin, tamsulosin, delequamine and phentolamine). In anesthetized rabbits, intravaginal injection of the alpha-1 AR selective antagonist REC 15/2615 (50 and 100 mug/kg) caused a 2 to 3-fold increase in genital tissue oxyhemoglobin (OHb) concentration. Similar increases in tissue OHb were observed with intravaginal injection of phentolamine (500 mug/kg) or a tri-mixture of vasodilators (PGE1, papaverine, phentolamine). REC 15/2615, phentolamine or the tri-mixture also enhanced the amplitude and/or duration of change in genital tissue OHb after pelvic nerve stimulation. Thus, vaginal tissue expresses functional alpha-1 and alpha-2 AR, which modulate vaginal smooth muscle contractility and genital engorgement. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

To date, there are no effective treatments for these core symptoms. Several studies have shown that the brain serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmission system is altered in both ASD patients and animal models of the disease. Multiple pieces of evidence suggest that targeting 5-HT receptors may treat the core symptoms of ASD and associated intellectual disabilities. In fact, stimulation of the 5-HT1A receptor reduces repetitive and restricted behaviors; blockade of the 5-HT2A receptor reduces both learning deficits and repetitive behavior, and activation of the 5-HT7 receptor improves cognitive performances and reduces repetitive behavior. On such a basis, we have designed novel arylpiperazine derivatives pursuing unprecedently reported activity profiles: dual 5-HT7/5-HT1A receptor agonist properties and mixed 5-HT7 agonist/5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist properties. Seventeen new compounds were synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assay at the target receptors. We have identified the dual 5-HT1AR/5-HT7R agonists 8c and 29 and the mixed 5-HT1AR agonist/5-HT7R agonist/5-HT2AR antagonist 20b. These compounds are metabolically stable in vitro and have suitable central nervous system druglike properties.

To date, only flutemetamol, florbetaben and florbetapir have been approved for clinical use as imaging probes. Design of imaging probes requires a detailed understanding of disease mechanism(s) and receptor-ligand interaction. In this study, molecular docking, molecular dynamics and binding free energies were used to investigate the multiple binding sites exhibited by beta-amyloid fibrils. Protein atomic models 2BEG, 5KK3, 2M4J, 2LMN, 5OQV, 2NAO, 2MVX and 2MXU (protein databank codes) were used to investigate the nature and location of binding sites and binding profiles of selected molecules with known affinities. Although amyloid fibrils are known to have multiple binding sites, we demonstrated that model 2MXU possesses one site which is druggable and can bind with common scaffolds currently being used in the imaging of amyloid fibrils. Models 2NAO, 5KK3 and 2M4J revealed that even though multiple sites may be available in some fibrils, the entire protein may not have a druggable site. Molecular dynamics revealed atomic models 2MXU and 2MVX to be the least flexible among the list. The outcomes of this investigation can be translated to assist in designing novel molecules that can be used for brain imaging in Alzheimer's disease.

Synthesis and Initial Biological Evaluation of Boron-Containing Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Ligands for Treatment of Prostate Cancer Using Boron Neutron Capture Therapy	MOLECULAR PHARMACEUTICS			English	Article						boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT); prostate cancer; prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitor; carborane; boron uptake	GLUTAMATE CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-II; UREA-BASED INHIBITORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GLIOBLASTOMA-MULTIFORME; PSMA; BNCT; PET; BORONOPHENYLALANINE; NA2B12H11SH; EXPRESSION	Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) is a therapeutic modality which has been used for the treatment of cancers, including brain and head and neck tumors. For effective treatment via BNCT, efficient and selective delivery of a high boron dose to cancer cells is needed. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a target for prostate cancer imaging and drug delivery. In this study, we conjugated boronic acid or carborane functional groups to a well-established PSMA inhibitor scaffold to deliver boron to prostate cancer cells and prostate tumor xenograft models. Eight boron-containing PSMA inhibitors were synthesized. All of these compounds showed a strong binding affinity to PSMA in a competition radioligand binding assay (IC50 from 555.7 to 20.3 nM). Three selected compounds 1a, 1d, and 1f were administered to mice, and their in vivo blocking of( 68)Ga-PSMA-11 uptake was demonstrated through a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution experiment. Biodistribution analysis demonstrated boron uptake of 4-7 mu g/g in 22Rv1 prostate xenograft tumors and similar tumor/muscle ratios compared to the ratio for the most commonly used BNCT compound, 4-borono-L-phenylalanine (BPA). Taken together, these data suggest a potential role for PSMA targeted BNCT agents in prostate cancer therapy following suitable optimization.

Previous works showed that accounting for TSPO endothelial binding improves PET quantification for [C-11]PBR28, [F-18]DPA714 and [C-11]-R-PK11195. It is still unclear, however, whether the vascular signal is tracer-dependent. This work aims to explore the relationship between the TSPO vascular and tissue components for PET tracers with varying affinity, also assessing the impact of affinity towards the differentiability amongst kinetics and the ensuing ligand amenability to cluster analysis for the extraction of a reference region. First, we applied the compartmental model accounting for vascular binding to [C-11]-R-PK11195 data from six healthy subjects. Then, we compared the [C-11]-R-PK11195 vascular binding estimates with previously published values for [F-18]DPA714 and [C-11]PBR28. Finally, we determined the suitability for reference region extraction by calculating the angle between grey and white matter kinetics. Our results showed that endothelial binding is common to all TSPO tracers and proportional to their affinity. By consequence, grey and white matter kinetics were most similar for the radioligand with the highest affinity (i.e. [C-11]PBR28), hence poorly suited for the extraction of a reference region using supervised clustering.

Higenamine (HG) is a novel alpha(1)-AR antagonist. In this study, we investigated the effects of HG in HEK293A cells transfected with alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, and alpha(1D)-AR in vitro, rat mesenteric artery ex vivo, Wistar-Kyoto rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats in vivo. The radioligand binding assay showed that HG competitively inhibited the binding of [H-3]-prazosin to alpha(1)-AR in a concentration-dependent manner. The affinities (pKi) of HG for the cloned alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, and alpha(1D)-AR were 6.57, 6.48, and 6.35, respectively, indicating that HG displayed no selectivity for the three alpha(1)-AR subtypes. In in vitro studies, HG was able to blunt inositol monophosphate production. It also displayed an inhibitory effect on the influx and entry of calcium ions and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 induced by phenylephrine (PE). In ex vivo studies, PE caused a dose-dependent inotropic response curve, and the pA(2) value for HG was 6.86 +/- 0.29. In addition, the in vivo results showed that HG could decrease the blood pressure in normotension, spontaneous hypertension, and PE-induced hypertension models. These results indicate that HG can directly bind to alpha(1)-AR and it appears to be a novel antagonist for alpha(1)-AR, which may contribute to its hypotensive effect.

One of the challenges for small-molecule PSMA inhibitors with respect to delivering therapeutic payloads is their rapid renal clearance. In order to overcome this pharmacokinetic challenge, we outfitted a Lu-177-labeled phosphoramidate-based PSMA inhibitor (CTT1298) with an albumin-binding motif (CTT1403) and compared its in vivo performance with that of an analogous compound lacking the albumin-binding motif (CTT1401). The radiolabeling of CTT1401 and CTT1403 was achieved using click chemistry to connect Lu-177-DOTA-N-3 to the dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-bearing CTT1298 inhibitor cores. A direct comparison in vitro and in vivo performance was made for CTT1401 and CTT1403; the specificity and efficacy by means of cellular uptake and internalization, biodistribution, and therapeutic efficacy were determined for both compounds. While both compounds displayed excellent uptake and rapid internalization in PSMA+ PC3-PIP cells, the albumin binding moiety in CTT1403 conferred clear advantages to the PSMA-inhibitor scaffold including increased circulating half-life and prostate tumor uptake that continued to increase up to 168 h post-injection. This increased tumor uptake translated into superior therapeutic efficacy of CTT1403 in PSMA+ PC3-PIP human xenograft tumors.

A Case Study Examining Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid Receptor Binding	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS; 11-BETA-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASE; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; STRESS RESPONSES; GENE-EXPRESSION; LONG-TERM; CORTICOSTERONE; BRAIN; SYSTEMS; CLONING	Hormone receptors are a necessary (although not sufficient) part of the process through which hormones like corticosterone create physiological responses. However, it is currently unknown to what extent receptor concentrations across different target tissues may be correlated within individual animals. In this study, we examined this question using a large dataset of radioligand binding data for glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) in 13 different tissues in the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) (n = 72). Our data revealed that individual house sparrows tended to exhibit higher or lower receptor binding across all tissues, which could be part of what creates the physiological and behavioral syndromes associated with different hormonal profiles. However, although statistically significant, the correlations between tissues were very weak. Thus, when each tissue was independently regressed on receptor concentrations in the other tissues, multivariate analysis revealed significant relationships only for sc fat (for GR) and whole brain, hippocampus, kidney, omental fat, and sc fat (for MR). Wealso found significant pairwise correlations only between receptor concentrations in brain and hippocampus, and brain and kidney (both for MR). This research reveals that although there are generalized individual consistencies in GR and MR concentrations, possibly due to such factors as hormonal regulation and genetic effects, the ability of 2 different tissues to respond to the same hormonal signal appears to be affected by additional factors that remain to be identified.

Fine-tuning of compound properties was achieved by small modifications of the substitution pattern. The most potent compounds of the present series include 5-methoxy-3-(2-methylbenzyl)-7-pentyl-2H-chromen-2-one (19a, PSB-SB-1201), a selective CB1 antagonist (K-i CB1 0.022 mu M), 5-methoxy-3-(2-methoxybenzyl)-7-pentyl-2H-chromen-2-one (21a, PSB-SB-1202), a dual CB1/CB2 agonist (CB1 K-i 0.032 mu M, EC50 0.056 mu M; CB2 K-i 0.049 mu M, EC50 0.014 mu M), 5-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-7-(2-methyloct-2-yl)-2H-chromen-2-one (25b, PSB-SB-1203), a dual CB1/CB2 ligand that blocks CB1 but activates CB2 receptors (CB1 K-i 0.244 mu M; CB2 K-i 0.210 mu M, EC50 0.054 mu M), and 7-(1-butylcyclopentyl)-5-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxybenzyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (27b, PSB-SB-1204), a selective CB2 receptor agonist (CB1 K-i 1.59 mu M; CB2 K-i 0.068 mu M, EC50 0.048 mu M).

A Novel Bioassay for Detecting GPCR Heterodimerization: Transactivation of Beta 2 Adrenergic Receptor by Bradykinin Receptor	JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR SCREENING			English	Article						electrophysiology; heterodimerization; transactivation; beta 2 adrenergic receptor; bradykinin type 2 receptor	BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; OPIOID RECEPTORS; PROTEIN; CELLS; OLIGOMERIZATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; CFTR	Many G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been shown to form heteromeric complexes primarily by biochemical methods, including competitive radioligand binding assays or measurements of changes in second-messenger concentration in lysed cells. these results are often cell line specific, and the expression of other cell surface proteins makes it difficult to detect potential functional consequences of GPCR interaction. Here, 2-electrode voltage clamping in Xenopus oocytes was used as a bioassay to explore heterodimerization of bradykinin type 2 receptor (Bk2R) and beta 2 adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR), using chloride channels as outputs for receptor activation. the data show for the first time that these 2 receptors heterodimerize with functional consequences. stimulation with bradykinin induced activation of G alpha q- and transactivation of G alpha s-coupled pathways in oocytes expressing Bk2R and beta(2)AR. to corroborate these data, potential receptor interaction was examined in PC12 cells, a cell line that endogenously expresses both receptors, and confirmed that stimulation with bradykinin transactivates beta(2)AR. in both oocytes and PC12 cells, transactivation was ablated by Bk2R or beta(2)AR inverse agonists, suggesting that transactivation occurred directly through both receptors. this is the first evidence of Bk2R/beta(2)AR physical interaction, forming a functional heterodimer. the oocyte system may prove highly useful for exploration of GPCR heterodimerization and the functional consequences thereof.

The hippocampus is likely to be art important brain structure in the pathophysiology of depression because it may mediate both cognitive deficits and hypercortisolemia found in this disorder. Decreased 5-HT1A binding was reported in the medial temporal cortex, which receives dense 5-HT innervation, and also throughout neocortical regions. Because the 5-HT1A antagonist pindolol may hasten antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications, its receptor occupancy has been measured in both presynaptic and postsynaptic sires. The results are controversial but suggest that pindolol has preferential occupancy of somatodendritic autoreceptors in the raphe. The results of 5-HT2A receptors are mixed, with one showing a significant decrease in the right orbitoinsular cortex and three not detecting a significant change, The disparate findings in patients with depression almost certainly reflect the heterogeneity of the disorder, and we highlight the utility of the hippocampus as a useful target region not only to compare depressed subjects with healthy subjects bur also to correlate findings with cognitive function and activity of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary axis system.

Using the AT(2) receptor-null (Agtr2-) mouse, we tested the hypothesis that the AT(2) receptor could exert an antigrowth effect in cardiac hypertrophy. Methods and Results-Cardiac hypertrophy was induced by suprarenal abdominal aortic banding in 10- to 12-week-old Agtr2- and wild-type (Agtr2+) mice for 6 or 12 weeks. Carotid arterial pressure was not different between the strains, although aortic banding increased arterial pressure by approximate to 40 mm Hg. Aortic banding increased the heart-weight/body-weight ratio and the cross-sectional area of cardiomyocytes by 15%, resulting in comparable cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in the 2 strains. In contrast, coronary arterial thickening and perivascular fibrosis, determined by the media/lumen-area ratio and the collagen/vessel-area ratio, respectively, were 50% greater in Agtr2- than in Agtr2+ mice after banding, whereas these parameters were similar in sham-operated mice. Radioligand binding studies using the whole heart and immunohistochemistry showed that AT(2) receptor expression was limited and localized in the coronary artery and perivascular region. Conclusions-These results suggest that the AT(2) receptor mediates an inhibitory effect on coronary arterial remodeling, such as medial hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis in response to pressure overload, and an activation of the renin-angiotensin system.

The rationale of the study was based both on the SAR observations and docking simulations of the interactions between the designed ligands and the binding site of human VGSC. HYDE docking scores, which describe hydrogen bonding, desolvation, and hydrophobic effects, obtained for 5-[(3-chlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-butyl/hexyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiones, justified their beneficial sodium channel blocking activity. The results of docking simulations were verified using a radioligand binding assay with [H-3]batrachotoxin. Unexpectedly, although the investigated triazole-based compounds acted as VGSC ligands, their affinities were lower than those of the respective analogs containing shorter alkyl linkers. Since numerous sodium channel blockers are recognized as antiepileptic agents, the obtained 1,2,4-triazole derivatives were examined for antiepileptic potential using an experimental model of tonic-clonic seizures in mice. Median effective doses (ED50) of the compounds examined in MES test reached 96.6 & PLUSMN; 14.8 mg/kg, while their median toxic doses (TD50), obtained in the rotarod test, were even as high as 710.5 & PLUSMN; 47.4 mg/kg.

In the present study, we compared the effects of DCS and AMA on dopamine D2/3R binding in the brain of adult rats in relation to motor behavior. D2/3R binding was determined with small animal SPECT in baseline and after challenge with DCS (20 mg/kg) or AMA (40 mg/kg) with [I-123]IBZM as radioligand. Immediately post-challenge, motor/exploratory behavior was assessed for 30 min in an open field. The regional binding potentials (ratios of the specifically bound compartments to the cerebellar reference region) were computed in baseline and post-challenge. DCS increased D2/3R binding in nucleus accumbens, substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area, thalamus, frontal, motor and parietal cortex as well as anterodorsal and posterior hippocampus, whereas AMA decreased D2/3R binding in nucleus accumbens, caudateputamen and thalamus. After DCS, ambulation and head-shoulder motility were decreased, while sitting was increased compared to vehicle and AMA. Moreover, DCS increased rearing relative to AMA. The regional elevations of D2/3R binding after DCS reflect a reduction of available dopamine throughout the mesolimbocortical system. In contrast, the reductions of D2/3R binding after AMA indicate increased dopamine in nucleus accumbens, caudateputamen and thalamus. Findings imply that, after DCS, nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopamine levels are directly related to motor/exploratory activity, whereas an inverse relationship may be inferred for AMA.

Evaluation of 4-oxo-quinoline-based CB2 PET radioligands in R6/2 chorea huntington mouse model and human ALS spinal cord tissue	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Cannabinoid receptor type 2; Positron emission tomography; Neuroimaging; Chorea Huntington; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis	CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGY; DOPAMINE; DISEASE; EXPRESSION; ANXIETY; SYSTEM; GENE	The cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) has been implicated in a series of neurodegenerative disorders and has emerged as an interesting biological target for therapeutic as well as diagnostic purposes. In the present work, we describe an improved radiosynthetic approach to obtain the previously reported CB2-specific PET radioligand [F-18]RS-126 in higher radiochemical yields and molar activities. Additionally, the study revealed that prolongation of the [F-18]RS-126 fluoroalkyl side chain ultimately leads to an improved stability towards mouse liver enzymes but is accompanied by a reduction in selectivity over the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). Huntington-related phenotypic changes as well as striatal D2R down regulation were confirmed for the transgenic R6/2 mouse model. CB2 upregulation in R6/2 Chorea Huntington mice was observed in hippocampus, cortex, striatum and cerebellum by qPCR, however, these results could not be confirmed at the protein level by PET imaging. Furthermore, we evaluated the utility of the newly developed [C-11]RS-028, a potent [F-18]RS-126 derivative with increased polarity and high selectivity over CB1 in post-mortem human ALS spinal cord and control tissue. Applying in vitro autoradiography, the translational relevance of CB2 imaging was demonstrated by the specific binding of [C-11]RS-028 to post-mortem human ALS spinal cord tissue.

The atypical antidepressant and neurorestorative agent tianeptine is a μ-opioid receptor agonist	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							INVOLVEMENT; ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION; PATHWAYS; NALOXONE; CAMP	Current pharmacological treatments of depression and related disorders suffer from major problems, such as a low rate of response, slow onset of therapeutic effects, loss of efficacy over time and serious side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new therapeutic approaches that address these issues. Interestingly, the atypical antidepressant tianeptine already meets in part these clinical goals. However, in spite of three decades of basic and clinical investigations, the molecular target of tianeptine, as well as its mechanism of action, remains elusive. Herein, we report the characterization of tianeptine as a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist. Using radioligand binding and cell-based functional assays, including bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assays for G-protein activation and cAMP accumulation, we identified tianeptine as an efficacious MOR agonist (K-i Human of 383 +/- 183 nM and EC50 Human of 194 +/- 70 nM and EC50 Mouse of 641 +/- 120 nM for G-protein activation). Tianeptine was also a full delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist, although with much lower potency (EC50 Human of 37.4 +/- 11.2 mu M and EC50 Mouse of 14.5 +/- 6.6 mu M for G-protein activation). In contrast, tianeptine was inactive at the.-opioid receptor (KOR, both human and rat). On the basis of these pharmacological data, we propose that activation of MOR (or dual activation of MOR and DOR) could be the initial molecular event responsible for triggering many of the known acute and chronic effects of this agent, including its antidepressant and anxiolytic actions.

Modulation of the apelin/APJ system in heart failure and atherosclerosis in man	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						apelin; APJ; dilated cardiomyopathy; ischaemic heart disease; atherosclerosis; coronary artery; human; G-protein coupled receptor	ENDOGENOUS INOTROPE APELIN; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; PEPTIDE APELIN; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; ANGIOGENIC FACTOR; ORPHAN RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; APJ; LIGAND; GENE	Background and purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether the apelin/APJ system is altered in human cardiovascular disease by investigating whether the expression of apelin or its receptor is altered at the protein level. Experimental approach: Radioligand binding studies were used to determine apelin receptor density in human cardiac tissues. Apelin peptide levels in cardiovascular tissues were determined by radioimmunoassay. In vitro pharmacology was used to assess vasoactive properties of apelin in human coronary artery. Localization of apelin and its receptor in coronary artery was determined using immunohistochemistry. Key results: Apelin receptor density was significantly decreased in left ventricle from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy or ischaemic heart disease compared with controls, but apelin peptide levels remained unchanged. Apelin was up-regulated in human atherosclerotic coronary artery and this additional peptide localized to the plaque, colocalizing with markers for macrophages and smooth muscle cells. Apelin potently constricted human coronary artery. Conclusions and implications: We have detected changes in the apelin/APJ system in human diseased cardiac and vascular tissue. The decrease in receptor density in heart failure may limit the positive inotropic actions of apelin, contributing to contractile dysfunction.

Transport of multiple nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the rat optic nerve:: high densities of receptors containing α6 and β3 subunits	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						alpha 6; nicotinic receptor subtypes; receptor transport; retinal ganglion cells; optic nerve; visual system	LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; SPONTANEOUS RETINAL WAVES; CHOLINERGIC-RECEPTORS; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; DOPAMINE RELEASE; HETEROMERIC SUBTYPES; BETA-3 SUBUNIT; AMACRINE CELLS; UP-REGULATION; CHICK RETINA	Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are abundant in the rat retina and at least seven heteromeric subtypes have been detected. Axons of retinal ganglion cells form the optic nerve and innervate areas of the brain important for visual processing, including the lateral geniculate nucleus, the superior colliculus, and the pretectal nucleus. Development of eye-specific layers in these projection areas are dependent upon retinal waves which are initially mediated by nAChRs [Feller et al., Science 272 (1996), 1182; Penn et al., Science 279 (1998), 2108; Bansal et al., J. Neurosci. 20 (2000), 7672]. Unilateral eye-enucleation studies in the rat indicate that nAChRs are on the terminals of optic nerve axons, where they may mediate influences of acetylcholine on visual pathways. In this study, we use radioligand binding and immunoprecipitation with subunit-selective antibodies to investigate the subunit composition of nAChRs in the rat optic nerve. We found multiple nAChR subtypes in the optic nerve, all of which contain the beta 2 subunit. Most of these receptors are mixed heteromeric subtypes, composed of at least three different subunits. Included among these subtypes is the highest percentage and density of alpha 6- and beta 3-containing nAChRs of any area of the rat CNS that has been reported.

Because mGluR5 is coupled to activation of protein kinase C (PKC), and targeted deletion of the epsilon isoform (PKCepsilon) in mice reduces ethanol self-administration, we investigated whether there is a functional link between mGluR5 and PKCepsilon. Here, we show that acute administration of the mGluR5 agonist (R,S)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine to mice increases phosphorylation of PKCepsilon in its activation loop (T566) as well as in its C-terminal region (S729). Increases in phospho-PKCepsilon are dependent not only on mGluR5 stimulation but also on phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K). In addition, the selective mGluR5 antagonist 6-methyl-2-(phenyl-ethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) reduced basal levels of phosphorylation of PKCepsilon at S729. We also show that MPEP dose dependently reduced ethanol consumption in wild-type but not in PKCepsilon-null mice, suggesting that PKCepsilon is an important signaling target for modulation of ethanol consumption by mGluR5 antagonists. Radioligand binding experiments using [H-3]MPEP revealed that these genotypic differences in response to MPEP were not a result of altered mGluR5 levels or binding in PKCepsilon-null mice. Our data indicate that mGluR5 is coupled to PKCepsilon via a PI3K-dependent pathway and that PKCepsilon is required for the ability of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP to reduce ethanol consumption.

Radioligand binding studies and adenylyl cyclase assays, performed with recently cloned human A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) adenosine receptors, showed that these modifications produced a decrease in potency at A(2B) receptor, as well as a general reduction in affinity at the other receptor subtypes. On the other hand, the contemporary presence of an ethyl substituent in N-6-position and of a 4'-ethylcarboxamido group in the same compounds led to (R,S)-N-6-ethyl -2-phenylhydroxypropynyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine and (S)-N-6-ethyl-2-phenylhydroxypropynyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, which did not show the expected increase in potency at A(2B) subtype. Hence, (S)-2-phenylhydroxypropynyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine [(S)-PHPNECA] with EC50 A(2B) = 220 nM remains the most potent agonist at A(2B) receptor reported so far.

In this study, the postsynaptic receptor binding potential of this ligand was examined as a possible indicator of synaptic serotonin content after pharmacological challenge. Studies were performed in 11 subjects with a history of recurrent major depression. Six of them received serotonergic antidepressive treatment at the time of the experiment, the other five patients were untreated. Two PET measurements were carried out in each subject within 2 or 3 days. Before one of the measurements, 25 mg of the serotonin re-uptake inhibitor clomipramine were given intravenously, the other measurement was done without pharmacological challenge. The data were analyzed using non-linear least-square regression and Logan's graphical method. In the whole group of subjects, binding potential and distribution volume of altanserin decreased following clomipramine challenge. The decrease was between 14 (P = 0.03) and 23% (P = 0.004). This effect was mainly seen in subjects not on antidepressive medication. Clomipramine challenge probably increased the synaptic serotonin level, which competed with altanserin leading to the lowered binding potential. The paradigm might, thus, be useful to estimate serotonin release in vivo. Pretreatment with serotonergic antidepressants reduces the effect of clomipramine. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

However, despite an obvious utility for synthetic pharmacological agents, there are few reports of selective, nonpeptide agonists or antagonists to receptors for these hormones. We have identified and characterized a novel synthetic molecule capable of inhibiting the action of FSH. This compound, 7-(4-[Bis-(2-carbamoyl-ethyl)-aminol-6-chloro(1,3,5)-triazin-2-ylamino)-4-hydroxy-3-(4-methoxy-phenylazo)- naphthalene)-2-sulfonic acid, sodium salt (compound 1), is a selective, noncompetitive inhibitor of the human (h) and rat (r) FSH receptors (FSHRs). Compound 1 selectively inhibited binding of [I-125]hFSH with an IC50 value of 5.4 +/- 2.3 mum. Radioligand-binding assays were performed using the baculovirus expressed extracellular domain of hFSHR (BV-tFSHR) to demonstrate site-specific interaction. Compound 1 competed for ([12)5/I]hFSH binding to BV-tFSHR with an IC50 value of 10 +/- 2.8 muM. Functionally, compound 1 inhibited hFSH-induced cAMP accumulation and steroidogenesis in vitro with an IC50 value of 3 +/- 0.6 muM. Competition of compound 1 for binding to other glycoprotein hormone receptors and other G protein-coupled receptors demonstrated select activity for FHSRs. Compound I inhibited ovulation in immature and cycling adult rats. These data provide proof of concept that selective, small molecule antagonists can be designed for glycoprotein hormone receptors.

Here, we per-formed positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in combination with histopathological analysis to better understand the underlying pathomechanisms of HDAC6 in AD. We first developed [18F]PB118 which was demonstrated as a valid HDAC6 radioligand with excellent brain penetration and high spec-ificity to HDAC6. PET studies of [18F]PB118 in 5xFAD mice showed significantly increased radioactivity in the brain compared to WT animals, with more pronounced changes identified in the cortex and hippo -campus. The translatability of this radiotracer for AD in a potential human use was supported by addi-tional studies, including similar uptake profiles in non-human primates, an increase of HDAC6 in AD -related human postmortem hippocampal tissues by Western blotting protein analysis, and our ex vivo his-topathological analysis of HDAC6 in postmortem brain tissues of our animals. Collectively, our findings show that HDAC6 may lead to AD by mechanisms that tend to affect brain regions particularly suscep-tible to AD through an association with amyloid pathology. 2022 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.

The photoperiodic information is detected by retinal photoreceptors and transmitted through nerve transmissions to the pineal gland, where MLT is synthesized and secreted at night into the blood. MLT interacts with two G protein-coupled receptors, MT1 and MT2. The aim of our work was to provide evidence for the presence of MLT receptors in the ovine pineal gland and define their involvement on melatonin secretion. For the first time, we identified the expression of MLT receptors with the specific 2-[I-125]-MLT agonistic radioligand in ovin pinealocytes. The values of Kd and Bmax are 2.24 +/- 1.1 nM and 20 +/- 6.8 fmol/mg. MLT receptors are functional and inhibit cAMP production and activate ERK1/2 through pertussis toxin-sensitive G(i/o) proteins. The MLT receptor antagonist/ inverse agonist luzindole increased cAMP production (189 +/- 30%) and MLT secretion (866 +/- 13%). The effect of luzindole on MLT secretion was additive with the effect of well-described activators of this pathway such as the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol and the alpha-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine. Co-incubation of all three compounds increased MLT secretion by 1236 +/- 199%. These results suggest that MLT receptors are involved in the negative regulation of the synthesis of its own ligand in pinealocytes. While adrenergic receptors promote MLT secretion, MLT receptors mitigate this effect to limit the quantity of MLT secreted by the pineal gland.

Acute Statin Treatment Improves Antibody Accumulation in EGFR- and PSMA-Expressing Tumors	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; TARGETED RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; FACTOR RECEPTOR; CANCER; CHOLESTEROL; INTERNALIZATION; CELLS; ENDOCYTOSIS; ASSOCIATION	Purpose: Statins are cholesterol-depleting drugs used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia. Preclinically, statins disrupt trafficking of receptors present at the cell membrane. Membrane receptors, defined as tumor biomarkers and therapeutic targets, are often internalized by an endocytic pathway. Indeed, receptor endocytosis and recycling are dynamic mechanisms that often affect receptor density at the cell surface. In therapies using monoclonal antibodies (mAb), a downregulation in receptor density at the cell surface decreases antibody binding to the extracellular domain of the membrane receptor. Here, we determined the potential of lovastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin in preclinically modulating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) receptor density at the tumor cell surface. Experimental Design: Small-animal PET was used to study the binding of Zr-89-labeled antibodies in ectopic xenografts. Ex vivo analyses were performed to determine changes in endocytic proteins, EGFR, and PSMA surface levels. Results: Acute statin treatment using lovastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin enhanced tumors' avidity for the mAbs panitumumab, cetuximab, and huJ591. Statins temporarily modulated caveolin-1, cavin-1, endophilin, clathrin, and dynamin proteins in EGFR- and PSMA-overexpressing xenografts. Conclusions: These data show the potential of statins as pharmacologic modulators of endocytic proteins for improved tumors' accumulation of mAbs. The translational significance of these findings lies in the potential of statins to temporarily modulate the heterogeneous presence of receptors at the cell membrane, a characteristic often associated with poor response in tumors to therapeutic antibodies.

It has been demonstrated that PD is mainly conferred by LRRK2 mutations that bring about increased kinase activity. As a consequence, selective inhibition of LRRK2 may help to recover the normal functions of LRRK2, thereby serving as a promising alternative therapeutic target for PD treatment. The mapping of LRRK2 by positron emission tomography (PET) studies allows a thorough understanding of PD and other LRRK2-related disorders; it also helps to validate and translate novel LRRK2 inhibitors. However, no LRRK2 PET probes have yet been reported in the primary literature. Herein we present a facile synthesis and preliminary evaluation of [C-11]GNE-1023 as a novel potent PET probe for LRRK2 imaging in PD. [C-11]GNE-1023 was synthesized in good radiochemical yield (10 % non-decay-corrected RCY), excellent radiochemical purity (>99 %), and high molar activity (>37 GBq mu mol(-1)). Excellent in vitro binding specificity of [C-11]GNE-1023 toward LRRK2 was demonstrated in cross-species studies, including rat and nonhuman primate brain tissues by autoradiography experiments. Subsequent whole-body biodistribution studies indicated limited brain uptake and urinary and hepatobiliary elimination of this radioligand. This study may pave the way for further development of a new generation of LRRK2 PET probes.

We evaluated here Re-188 (t(1/2)=16.9 h) labeled RGD-BBN as a potential agent for radionuclide therapy of prostate cancer. RGD-BBN was conjugated with S-benzoylmercaptoacetylglycylglycyl (MAG(2)), and then labeled with Tc-99m or Re-188, respectively. The dual-receptor binding affinity of MAG(2)-RGD-BBN was investigated by a radioligand competition binding assay. Biodistributions study of Re-188-MAG(2)-RGD-BBN was carried out in normal BALB/c mice and PC-3 human prostate tumor-bearing nude mice. Gamma imaging studies were performed in PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice. Biodistribution in normal mice showed that both Tc-99m and Re-188-labeled MAG(2)-RGD-BBN possessed high pancreas uptake due to the high GRPR expression of this organ. Gamma imaging with both Tc-99m and Re-188-labeled RGD-BBN in PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice demonstrated high tumor uptake. The PC-3 tumors were clearly visible at 1 postinjection, with high contrast to the contralateral background. The use of chelator MAG(2) enables successful and high-yield Tc-99m and Re-188 radiolabeling of RGD-BBN with favorable tumor targeting specificity. Further optimization may allow potential clinical application of Re-188-MAG(2)-RGD-BBN for tumor-targeted radionuclide therapy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Reduced basal ganglia μ-opioid receptor availability in trigeminal neuropathic pain: A pilot study	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article						Trigeminal Neuropathic Pain; Opioid system; Neuroplasticity; Chronic pain; Positron emission tomography	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BINDING; NEUROTRANSMISSION; CONTRIBUTE; VALENCE; REWARD; SIGNAL	Background: Although neuroimaging techniques have provided insights into the function of brain regions involved in Trigeminal Neuropathic Pain (TNP) in humans, there is little understanding of the molecular mechanisms affected during the course of this disorder. Understanding these processes is crucial to determine the systems involved in the development and persistence of TNP. Findings: In this study, we examined the regional mu-opioid receptor (mu OR) availability in vivo (non-displaceable binding potential BPND) of TNP patients with positron emission tomography (PET) using the mu OR selective radioligand [C-11] carfentanil. Four TNP patients and eight gender and age-matched healthy controls were examined with PET. Patients with TNP showed reduced mu OR BPND in the left nucleus accumbens (NAc), an area known to be involved in pain modulation and reward/aversive behaviors. In addition, the mu OR BPND in the NAc was negatively correlated with the McGill sensory and total pain ratings in the TNP patients. Conclusions: Our findings give preliminary evidence that the clinical pain in TNP patients can be related to alterations in the endogenous mu-opioid system, rather than only to the peripheral pathology. The decreased availability of mu ORs found in TNP patients, and its inverse relationship to clinical pain levels, provide insights into the central mechanisms related to this condition. The results also expand our understanding about the impact of chronic pain on the limbic system.

On the basis of these and previous results on the potent antagonist effect of 8-pyrazolyl-xanthines at human A(2B)AR, a new series of compounds was synthesized and evaluated in binding studies against the human A(1), A(2A), A(3), and A(2B)ARS. A remarkable improvement in selectivity with respect to the previous series, maintaining the potency at human A(2B) receptor, was achieved, as exemplified by the 8-[3-(4-chloro-6-trifluoromethyl-1H-benzoimidazol-2-yl-methoxy)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]-1,3-dipropyl-3,7-dihydro-purine-2,6-dione derivative 66: K-i A(2B) = 9.4 nM, IC50 hA(2B) = 26 nM hA(1)/hA(2B) = 269, hA(2A)/hA(2B) > 106, hA(3)/hA(2B) > 106. This study also led to the identification of a series of pyrazole-xanthine compounds with a simplified structure, exemplified by 8-(3-hydroxy-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-xanthine 80 displaying very high affinity at A(2B)AR with good selectivity over AR subtypes (K-i = 4.0 nM, IC50 hA(2B) = 20 nM hA(1)/hA(2B) = 183, hA(2A),h(A3)/hA(2B) > 250).

Hypercholesterolaemia exacerbates ventricular remodelling after myocardial infarction in the rat: role of angiotensin II type 1 receptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						myocardial infarction; hypercholesterolaemia; statin; sartan; heart failure; remodelling; rat	A REDUCTASE INHIBITOR; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; SMOOTH-MUSCLE CELLS; POSTMYOCARDIAL INFARCTION; CHOLESTEROL-METABOLISM; CARDIAC FIBROBLASTS; PRAVASTATIN SODIUM; SYSTOLIC FUNCTION; AT(1) RECEPTORS; HEART-FAILURE	Background and purpose: Diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia exacerbates post-myocardial infarction (MI) ventricular remodelling and heart failure, but the mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown. This study examined whether worsening of post-MI ventricular remodelling induced by dietary hypercholesterolaemia was related to upregulation of angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor in the rat heart. Experimental approach: MI was induced surgically in rats fed normal or high cholesterol diet. Both groups of rats were then assigned to control, atorvastatin, losartan or atorvastatin+losartan-treated subgroups and followed for 8 weeks. Left ventricular (LV) function was assessed with echocardiography. In isolated hearts, LV pressures were measured with a latex balloon and a tip catheter. AT1-receptor density was assessed in LV membranes with radioligand-binding assays. Key results: High cholesterol diet exacerbated LV dilation and dysfunction in post-MI hearts. Atorvastatin or losartan prevented these hypercholesterolaemia-induced effects, whereas their combination was not more effective than each drug alone. AT1 receptors were upregulated 8 weeks after MI, this was further increased by hypercholesterolaemia and restored to baseline levels by atorvastatin. Conclusions and implications: Hypercholesterolaemia exacerbated LV remodelling and dysfunction in post-MI rat hearts and upregulated cardiac AT1 receptors. All these effects were effectively prevented by atorvastatin. Thus, the pleiotropic statin effects may include interference with the renin-angiotensin system through downregulation of AT1 receptors.

Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) is an enzyme that metabolizes monoamines, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. Objective: To determine whether MAO-A levels in the brain are elevated during untreated depression. Setting: Tertiary care psychiatric hospital. Patients: Seventeen healthy and 17 depressed individuals with major depressive disorder that met entry criteria were recruited from the care of general practitioners and psychiatrists. All study participants were otherwise healthy and nonsmoking. Depressed individuals had been medication free for at least 5 months. Main Outcome Measure: Harmine labeled with carbon 11, a radioligand selective for MAO-A and positron emission tomography, was used to measure MAO-A DVS (specific distribution volume), an index of MAO-A density, in different brain regions (prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, caudate, putamen, thalamus, anterior temporal cortex, midbrain, hippocampus, and parahippocampus). Results: The MAO-A DVS was highly significantly elevated in every brain region assessed (t test; P=.001 to 3 x 10(-7)). The MAO-ADV(S) was elevated on average by 34% (2 SDs) throughout the brain during major depression. Conclusions: The sizable magnitude of this finding and the absence of other compelling explanations for monoamine loss during major depressive episodes led to the conclusion that elevated MAO-A density is the primary monoamine-lowering process during major depression.

The results disprove the ACE inhibition as the only single mechanism and also the direct interaction of potentiating peptides with the bradykinin receptors in transfected COS-7 cells as molecular mechanism of potentiation. Our results indicate a stimulation of inositol phosphates (IPn) formation independently from the B-2 receptor. Furthermore, the results with La3+ support the role of extracellular Ca2+ and its influx through corresponding channels. The missing effect of calyculin on the GPI disproves the role of phosphatases in the potentiating action. These experimental studies should not only contribute to a better understanding of the potentiating mechanisms but also incorporate a shift in the research towards the immune system, in particular towards the immunocompetent polymorphonuclear leukocytes. The chemotaxis of these cells can be potentiated most likely by exclusive inhibition of the enzymatic degradation of bradykinin. Thus the obtained results give evidence that the potentiation of the bradykinin action can occur by different mechanisms, depending on the system and on the applied. potentiating factor.

Our aim was to test the hypothesis that islet cell autoantibodies, as markers for beta cell autoimmunity, are increased in cord blood from newborns with a diagnosis of blood group incompatibility. Using the diagnosis register of the Malmo University Hospital we obtained cord blood from 151 children with ABO immunization, 311 children with hyperbilirubinemia and a control group of 320 other children born during the same time period. The cord blood samples were analyzed for islet cell antibodies (ICA) by indirect immunofluorescence and autoantibodies against the Islet Cell Antigen-2 (IA-2Ab) and the 65 kDa isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65Ab) by standard radioligand binding assays. The prevalence of ICA was increased compared to controls (0.6%) not only in children with ABO immunization (4.0%, p = 0.02), but also in newborn children with hyperbilirubinemia (4.2%, p = 0.003). The prevalence of IA2Ab, but not of GAD65Ab, was increased in children with ABO immunization (3.3%) compared to the hyperbilirubinemia group without incompatibility (0.6%, p = 0.04), or the controls (0.3%, p = 0.02). Our findings that hyperbilirubinemia is associated with an increased prevalence of ICA, and blood group incompatibility with both ICA and IA-2, suggests that infra-uterine factors may be associated with islet cell autoimmunity.

Methods and Results-Platelets were obtained from peripheral venous blood of 45 healthy human volunteers at the end of 2 weeks of caffeine abstinence and at 12, 60, and 108 hours after the last dose of caffeine. The lowest dose of caffeine, when given for only 7 days, had no effect. Increasing the total dose, either by giving 400 mg/d for 14 days or giving 600 mg/d, resulted in binding assays performed with the adenosine A, receptor radioligand [H-3]SCH 58261 [5-amino-7(phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c]pyrimidine], in the upregulation of A, receptors. Moreover, the potency of HE-NECA to produce antiaggregatory effects, a rise in cAMP accumulation, and a decrease in calcium levels was significantly increased. Conclusions-Chronic caffeine intake can lead to upregulation of adenosine A(2A) receptors, which is accompanied by sensitization, in a time- and dose-dependent manner, to the actions of the agonist HE-NECA.

This led us to investigate whether levels of the high affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors are also altered in BA 24. Methods: We measured the binding levels of a high-affinity nicotinic receptor-selective radioligand, [3H]epibatidine, in BA 24 from subjects with MDD (n = 20), BD (n = 18) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 20). We used qPCR to measure mRNA expression of the high affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit CHRNB2 in these subjects. Results: [3H]Epibatidine binding density and CHRNB2 mRNA expression were not significantly altered in either MDD or BD compared to control levels. While validating reference genes for our qPCR experiments, we found that the mRNA levels of 3 putative reference genes, TFB1M, PPIA and SNCA, were increased in MDD but not BD compared to controls. Further investigations in other cortical regions showed that these changes were specific to BA24. Limitations: Cohort size and available patient data were limited due to standard constraints associated with postmortem studies. Conclusion: Our data suggest that decreased CHRM2 in BA24 in mood disorders is not associated with a corresponding change in high affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression. Our findings of increased TFB1M, PPIA and SNCA expression in MDD point to a broader derangement of several homeostatic pathways in MDD that are distinct from BD.

Despite numerous therapeutic options, few treatments are available for patients with end-stage disease. In the present study, different somatostatin receptors (SSTs) and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 were evaluated for their suitability as novel therapeutic targets in PCa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of SST subtypes 1, 2A, 3, and 5 and of CXCR4 was evaluated in 276 PCa tumor samples on a tissue microarray (TMA) in 23 whole-block tumor samples and in 3 PCa cell lines by immunohistochemistry using well-characterized monoclonal antibodies. RESULTS: Overall, the frequency and intensity of expression of SSTs and CXCR4 were very low among the PCa samples investigated. Specifically, SST5, SST2A, and SST3 were expressed, albeit at low intensity, in 10.5%, 9.1%, and 0.7% of the TMA samples, respectively. None of the TMA samples showed SST1 or CXCR4 expression. Only a single small-cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma that was coincidentally included among the whole-block samples exhibited strong SST2A, SST5, and CXCR4 and moderate SST3 expression. Independent of the tumor cells, the tumor capillaries in many of the PCa samples were strongly positive for SST2A, SST3, SST5, or CXCR4 expression. SST expression in the tumor cells was associated with advanced tumor grade and stage. CONCLUSION: Overall, SST and CXCR4 expression levels are clearly of no therapeutic relevance in PCa. SST- or CXCR4-based therapy might be feasible, however, in rare cases of small-cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma of the prostate.

Because of its role in memory and cognitive process, this receptor might be implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and associated disorders. Objective: The aim of this studywas to investigate the binding of [F-18]2FNQ1P, a newspecific radiotracer of 5-HT6 receptors, and to quantify 5-HT6 receptor density in caudate nucleus in a population of patients with different AD stages. Methods: Patients were classified according to the "ABC" NIA-AA classification. In vitro binding assays were performed in postmortem brain tissue from the healthy control (HC; n = 8) and severe AD ("High"; n = 8) groups. In vitro quantitative autoradiography was performed in human brain tissue (caudate nucleus) from patients with different stages of AD: HC (n = 15), "Low" (n = (18)), "Int" (n = 20), and "High" (n = 15). Results: In vitro binding assays did not show significant differences for the KD and Bmax parameters between "High" and HC groups. In vitro quantitative autoradiography showed a significant difference between the "High" and HC groups (p = 0.0025). We also showed a progressive diminution in [F-18]2FNQ1P specific binding, which parallels 5-HT6 receptors expression, according to increasing AD stage. Significant differences were observed between the HC group and all AD stages combined ("Low", "Intermediate", and "High") (p = 0.011). Conclusion: This study confirms the interest of investigating the role of 5-HT6 receptors in AD and related disorders. [F-18]2FNQ1P demonstrated specific binding to 5-HT6 receptors.

However, C8 gamma is also suggested to be a carrier protein for the general clearance of endogenous and exogenous compounds because it belongs to the lipocalin family of small secreted proteins that have the common ability to bind small hydrophobic ligands. Although retinoic acid, a metabolite of vitamin A, has been suggested as a potential ligand of C8 gamma, it remains unclear which other substances are able to bind to C8 gamma as ligands. Here, we evaluated the binding affinity of several organotin compounds that are ligands of a receptor of retinoic acid, retinoid X receptor, by using radioligand binding assays. The amount of [C-14]triphenyltin (TPT), a tri-substituted organotin, that bound to purified recombinant C8 gamma was increased with increasing protein concentration, whereas that of Mall-trans retinoic acid and [H-3]9-cis retinoic acid was unchanged. Scatchard analysis revealed that [C-14]TPT bound to C8 gamma with an equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) of 56.2 +/- 16.2 nM. Non-radiolabeled tributyhin (TBT), another tri-substituted organotin, blocked the binding of [C-14]TPT to C8 gamma in a competitive manner, but non-radiolabeled mono- or di-substituted organotin compounds did not. Together, our present observations indicate that TBT and TPT, but not retinoic acid or mono- or di-substituted organotin compounds, are potent ligands of C8 gamma, suggesting that C8 gamma may be involved in the toxicities of these organotin compounds.

Continuing the study in this field, we report here the design and synthesis of 3-(hetero)arylpyrazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline and 3-(hetero)aroylpyrazolo[1,5-a]quinazoline 8-methoxy substituted as interesting analogs of the above (hetero)arylalkylester, in which the shortening or the removal of the linker between the 3-(hetero)aryl ring and the PQ was performed. Only compounds that are able to inhibit radioligand binding by more than 80% at 10 M have been selected for electrophysiological studies on recombinant 122L GABA(A) receptors. Some compounds show a promising profile. For example, compounds 6a and 6b are able to modulate the GABA(A)R in an opposite manner, since 6b enhances and 6a reduces the variation of the chlorine current, suggesting that they act as a partial agonist and an inverse partial agonist, respectively. The most potent derivative was 3-(4-methoxyphenylcarbonyl)-8-methoxy-4,5-dihydropyrazolo[1,5-a] quinazoline 11d, which reaches a maximal activity at 1 M (+54%), and it enhances the chlorine current at 0.01 M. Finally, compound 6g, acting as a null modulator at 122L, shows the ability to antagonize the full agonist diazepam and the potentiation of CGS 9895 on the new +/- non-traditional' benzodiazepine site.

In vivo evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]preladenant positron emission tomography for quantification of adenosine A<sub>2A</sub> receptors in the rat brain	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Adenosine A(2A) receptors; receptor occupancy; [C-11]preladenant; small-animal positron emission tomography; pharmacokinetic modeling	HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BLOOD-VOLUME; PET; BINDING; LIGAND; A2-RECEPTORS; PRELADENANT; OCCUPANCY; STRIATUM	[C-11]Preladenant was developed as a novel adenosine A(2A) receptor positron emission tomography radioligand. The present study aims to evaluate the suitability of [C-11] preladenant positron emission tomography for the quantification of striatal A(2A) receptor density and the assessment of striatal A(2A) receptor occupancy by KW-6002. Sixty- or ninety-minute dynamic positron emission tomography imaging was performed on rats. Tracer kinetics was quantified by the two-tissue compartment model, Logan graphical analysis and several reference tissue-based models. Test-retest reproducibility was assessed by repeated imaging on two consecutive days. Two-tissue compartment model and Logan plot estimated comparable distribution volume (V-T) values of similar to 10 in the A(2A) receptor-rich striatum and substantially lower values in all extra-striatal regions (similar to 1.5-2.5). The simplified reference tissue model with midbrain or occipital cortex as the reference region proved to be the best non-invasive model for quantification of A(2A) receptor, showing a striatal binding potential (BPND) value of similar to 5.5, and a test-retest variability of similar to 5.5%. The brain metabolite analysis showed that at 60-min post injection, 17% of the radioactivity in the brain was due to radioactive metabolites. The ED50 of KW-6002 in rat striatum for i. p. injection was 0.044-0.062 mg/kg. The study demonstrates that [C-11] preladenant is a suitable tracer to quantify striatal A(2A) receptor density and assess A(2A) receptor occupancy by A(2A) receptor-targeting molecules.

The muscarinic antagonists scopolamine and atropine are competitive antagonists at 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						5-HT3; Cys-loop; Binding site; Ligand docking; Scopolamine; Muscarinic; Antagonist; Muscarinic; Anxiety; Cognition; Memory; Depression; Hippocampus; Amygdala	STRUCTURAL DETERMINANTS; BINDING; MEMORY; BIOAVAILABILITY; RADIOLIGAND; ONDANSETRON; SEROTONIN; LIGANDS	Scopolamine is a high affinity muscarinic antagonist that is used for the prevention of post-operative nausea and vomiting. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are used for the same purpose and are structurally related to scopolamine. To examine whether 5-HT3 receptors are affected by scopolamine we examined the effects of this drug on the electrophysiological and ligand binding properties of 5-HT(3)A receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes and HEK293 cells, respectively. 5-HT3 receptor-responses were reversibly inhibited by scopolamine with an IC50 of 2.09 mu M. Competitive antagonism was shown by Schild plot (pA(2) = 5.02) and by competition with the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists [H-3]granisetron (K-i = 6.76 mu M) and G-FL (K-i = 4.90 mu M). The related molecule, atropine, similarly inhibited 5-HT evoked responses in oocytes with an IC50 of 1.74 mu M, and competed with G-FL with a K-i of 7.94 mu M. The reverse experiment revealed that granisetron also competitively bound to muscarinic receptors (K-i = 6.5 mu M). In behavioural studies scopolamine is used to block muscarinic receptors and induce a cognitive deficit, and centrally administered concentrations can exceed the IC50 values found here. It is therefore possible that 5-HT3 receptors are also inhibited. Studies that utilise higher concentrations of scopolamine should be mindful of these potential off-target effects.

Methods: [H-3] pirenzepine, [H-3]AF-DX 384 and [H-3]4-DAMP binding to the striatum from 37 subjects with schizophrenia (19 MRDS) and 20 controls as well as SNAP 25, PSD 95 and GFAP 41/43 in crude particulate membrane were measured. Results: [H-3] pirenzepine and [H-3] AF-DX 384 binding to the striatum were significantly lower in schizophrenia due to lower binding of both radioligands in the striatum from MRDS. Levels of PSD 95 were higher in schizophrenia, predominantly due to higher levels in MRDS. Conclusions: Our data suggest muscarinic M1 ([H-3] pirenzepine) and M2 and/or M4 receptors ([H-3] AF-DX 384) are lower in the striatum from MRDS which could mediate inappropriate adaption to internal and external cues which, in turn, would affect motivation, cognition and motor control. Increased levels of PSD 95 could indicate increased post-synaptic boutons or changes in NMDA receptor-mediated signalling in MRDS. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study we aimed to identify the mechanisms (changes in radioligand binding, transcription or RNA-editing) related to such a behavioral outcome. Rats received vehicle or nicotine (0.4mg/kg, s.c.) for 5days in home cages. Brain 5-HT2A/2C receptors were analyzed on day 3 of nicotine withdrawal. Nicotine withdrawal increased [H-3]ketanserin binding to 5-HT2A receptors in the ventral tegmental area and ventral dentate gyrus, yet decreased binding in the nucleus accumbens shell. Reduction in [H-3]mesulergine binding to 5-HT2C receptors was seen in the ventral dentate gyrus. Profound decrease in the 5-HT2A receptor transcript level was noted in the hippocampus and ventral tegmental area. Out of five 5-HT2C receptor mRNA editing sites, deep sequencing data showed a reduction in editing at the E site and a trend toward reduction at the C site in the hippocampus. In the ventral tegmental area, a reduction for the frequency of CD 5-HT2C receptor transcript was seen. These results show that the reduction in the 5-HT2A receptor transcript level may be an auto-regulatory response to the increased receptor density in the hippocampus and ventral tegmental area during nicotine withdrawal, while decreased 5-HT2C receptor mRNA editing may explain the reduction in receptor labeling in the hippocampus.

Expression and Distribution of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor mRNA, Protein and Binding in the Male Nonhuman Primate (<i>Macaca mulatta</i>) Brain	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							INCRETIN-BASED THERAPIES; FOOD-INTAKE; BLOOD-PRESSURE; BODY-WEIGHT; SHORT-TERM; RAT-BRAIN; PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; GLP-1 RECEPTORS; HEART-RATE; IN-VIVO	Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is released from endocrine L-cells lining the gut in response to food ingestion. However, GLP-1 is also produced in the nucleus of the solitary tract, where it acts as an anorectic neurotransmitter and key regulator of many autonomic and neuroendocrine functions. The expression and projections of GLP-1-producing neurons is highly conserved between rodent and primate brain, although a few key differences have been identified. The GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been mapped in the rodent brain, but no studies have described the distribution of GLP-1Rs in the nonhuman primate central nervous system. Here, we characterized the distribution of GLP-1R mRNA and protein in the adult macaque brain using in situ hybridization, radioligand receptor autoradiography, and immunohistochemistry with a primate specific GLP-1R antibody. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the GLP-1R is localized to cell bodies and fiber terminals in a very selective distribution throughout the brain. Consistent with the functional role of the GLP-1R system, we find the highest concentration of GLP-1R-immunoreactivity present in select hypothalamic and brainstem regions that regulate feeding, including the paraventricular and arcuate hypothalamic nuclei, as well as the area postrema, nucleus of the solitary tract, and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Together, our data demonstrate that GLP-1R distribution is highly conserved between rodent and primate, although a few key species differences were identified, including the amygdala, where GLP-1R expression is much higher in primate than in rodent.

In hippocampal neurons, PS is essential for neurotransmitter release, NMDA receptor-mediated responses, and long-term potentiation. PS is also involved in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, although the precise site of its action is less clear. Here we investigate the mechanism by which PS regulates synaptic function and calcium homeostasis using acute hippocampal slices from PS conditional knockout mice and primary cultured postnatal hippocampal neurons, in which PS is inducibly inactivated. Using two different calcium probes, Fura-2 and Mag-Fura-2, we found that inactivation of PS in primary hippocampal neurons does not affect calcium concentration in the endoplasmic reticulum. Rather, in the absence of PS, levels of ryanodine receptor (RyR) are reduced in the hippocampus, measured by Western analysis and radioligand binding assay, although the mRNA expression is unaffected. RyR-mediated function is also impaired, as indicated by reduced RyR agonist-induced calcium release from the ER and RyR-mediated synaptic responses in the absence of PS. Furthermore, knockdown of RyR expression in wild-type hippocampal neurons by two independent shRNAs to levels comparable with the RyR protein reduction in PS-deficient hippocampal neurons mimics the defects exhibited in calcium homeostasis and presynaptic function. Collectively, our findings show that PS regulates calcium homeostasis and synaptic function via RyR and suggest that disruption of intracellular calcium homeostasis may be an early pathogenic event leading to presynaptic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease.

J	Stahl, E; Ellis, J				Stahl, Edward; Ellis, John			Novel Allosteric Effects of Amiodarone at the Muscarinic M<sub>5</sub> Receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ARACHIDONIC-ACID RELEASE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; CHIMERIC RECEPTORS; BETA-ADRENOCEPTORS; MUTANT MICE; MODULATORS; SITE; SUBTYPES; LIGANDS	Allosteric sites on muscarinic receptors may present superior therapeutic targets for several central nervous system disorders, due to the potential of allosteric ligands to provide more selective modulation and to preserve the spatiotemporal patterning that is characteristic of synaptic transmission. We have found that the antiarrhythmic drug amiodarone interacts allosterically with M-1 and M-5 muscarinic receptors. At both M-1 and M-5, amiodarone was only able to partially inhibit the binding of the orthosteric antagonist [H-3] N-methylscopolamine (NMS). In addition, amiodarone was able to alter the rate of dissociation of [H-3] NMS from M-1 and M-5 receptors. These findings suggest that NMS and amiodarone are able to bind to the receptor simultaneously. The pharmacology of the effect on NMS dissociation demonstrated that amiodarone was not interacting at the "common" site at which gallamine, obidoxime, and many other muscarinic allosteric ligands are known to bind. In functional studies, amiodarone enhanced the ability of acetylcholine (at EC20) to activate the M-5 receptor; however, under the same conditions, amiodarone did not enhance M-1 activation. More detailed studies at M-5 found that the effect of amiodarone was to enhance the efficacy of acetylcholine, without increasing its potency. This report describes the first demonstration of allosteric enhancement of efficacy at the M-5 receptor, and the first demonstration of enhancement of efficacy but not potency at any muscarinic receptor. In summary, amiodarone has been shown to be a novel positive allosteric modulator of muscarinic receptors that is selective for the M-5 subtype, relative to M-1.

Therefore positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents are greatly desired to study the NET pathway. We have developed a C-fluoropropyl analog of nisoxetine: (R)-N-methyl-3-(3'-[F-18]fluoropropyl)phenoxy)-3-phenylpropanamine (F-18-MFP3) as a new potential PET radiotracer for NET with the advantage of the longer half-life of fluorine-18 (110 mm compared with carbon-11 (20 min). Synthesis of (R)-N-methyl-3-(3'-fluoropropyl)phenoxy)-3-phenylpropanamine (MFP3) was achieved in five steps starting from (S)-N-methyl-3-ol-3-phenylpropanamine in approx. 3-5% overall yields. In vitro binding affinity of nisoxetine and MFP3 in rat brain homogenates labeled with H-3-nisoxetine gave Ki values of 8.02 nM and 23 nM, respectively. For radiosynthesis of F-18-MFP3, fluorine-18 was incorporated into a tosylate precursor, followed by the deprotection of the N-BOC-protected amine group with a 15% decay corrected yield in 2.5h. Reverse-phase chromatographic purification provided F-18-MFP3 in specific activities of >2000Ci/mmol. Fluorine-18 labeled F-18-MFP3 has been produced in modest radiochemical yields and in high specific activities. Evaluation of F-18-MFP3 in animal imaging studies is in progress in order to validate this new fluorine-18 radiotracer for PET imaging of NET.

Brain PET measurements were performed from 90 to 210 min after the injection of (S,S)-[(18)F] FMeNER-D2 in 20 healthy male Subjects. Binding potential (BP(ND)) was calculated as late time ratio of the target region to the reference region (caudate) minus one. BP(ND) template images were generated from mean parametric images obtained in a group of 10 Subjects Using SPM2. On the BP(ND)/MRI template images, functional ROIs based on several different BP(ND) thresholds for the thalamus and brainstem were generated automatically using PMOD 2.8 software in addition to anatomical ROIs. PET/MRI data of another group Of 10 subjects were used to evaluate the validity of the template method and the functional ROIs. NET BPND template images demonstrated higher binding in the media[ thalamus whereas the anterior and the pulvinar divisions had lower binding. In the brainstem, high binding was detected around the cerebral aqueduct of the midbrain and within the dorsal pons, in a volume comprising locus coeruleus. Functional ROIs with higher BP(ND) thresholds naturally yielded higher BPND and lower coefficients of variance than did anatomical ROIs. This study indicated that (S,S)-[(18)F]FMeNER-D(2) combined with a template method provides detailed information on the distribution of NET in vivo and that functional ROIs on the template would be useful in further clinical studies.

The mechanism of action of BK is thought to be primarily mediated by specific cell surface membrane B2 receptors (B2Rs). Some evidence has suggested, however, the existence of an intracellular/nuclear B2R population. Whether these receptors are functional and contribute to BK signaling remains to be determined. In this study, by mean of Western blotting, 3D-confocal microscopy, receptor autoradiography and radioligand binding analysis, we showed that plasma membrane and highly purified nuclei from isolated rat hepatocytes contain specific B2R that bind BK. The results depicting B2R nuclear expression in isolated nuclear organelles were reproduced in situ on hepatic sections by immunogold labeling and transmission electron microscopy. Functional tests on single nuclei, by means of confocal microscopy and the calcium-sensitive probe fluo-4AM, showed that BK induces concentration-de pen dent transitory mobilization of nucleoplasmic calcium; these responses were blocked by B2R antagonist HOE 140, not by the B I R antagonist R954 and, were also found in wild-type C57/B16 mice, but not in B2R-KO mice. In isolated nuclei, BK elicited activation/phosphorylation of Akt, acetylation of histone H3 and ensuing pro-inflammatory iNOS gene induction as determined by Western blot and RT-PCR. ChlP assay confirmed binding of acetylated-histone H3 complexes, but not B2R, to promoter region of iNOS gene suggesting that B2R-mediated gene expression is bridged with accessory downstream effectors. This study discloses a previously undescribed mechanism in BK-induced transcriptional events, via intracrine B2R-mediated signaling, occurring in rat autologous hepatic cells.

Characterization of the antiallergic drugs 3-[2-(2-phenylethyl) benzoimidazole-4-yl]-3-hydroxypropanoic acid and ethyl 3-hydroxy-3-[2-(2-phenylethyl)benzoimidazol-4-yl]propanoate as full aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							TH1/TH2 BALANCE MODULATOR; BREAST-CANCER CELLS; AH-RECEPTOR; AIRWAY HYPERRESPONSIVENESS; 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN TCDD; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; DIOXIN RECEPTOR; MICE LACKING; IN-VITRO; BINDING	The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates most of the toxic effects of numerous chlorinated (e.g., TCDD) and nonchlorinated polycyclic aromatic compounds (e.g., benzo[a]pyrene). Studies in AhR null mice suggested that this receptor may also play a role in the modulation of immune responses. Recently, two drugs, namely, M50354 and M50367 (ethyl ester derivative of M50354), were described as AhR ligands with high efficacy toward reducing atopic allergic symptoms in an AhR-dependent manner by skewing T helper cell differentiation toward a T(H)1 phenotype [Negishi et al. (2005) J. Immunol. 175 (11), 7348-7356]. Surprisingly, these drugs were shown to have minimal activity toward inducing classical dioxin responsive element-driven AhR-mediated CYP1A1 transcription. We synthesized and reevaluated the ability of these drugs to regulate AhR activity. In contrast to previously published data, both M50354 and M50367 were found to be potent inducers of several AhR target genes, namely, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A2. M50367 was a more effective agonist than M50354, perhaps accounting for its higher bioavailability in vivo. However, M50354 was capable of displacing an AhR-specific radioligand more effectively than M50367. This is consistent with M50354 being the active metabolite of M50367. In conclusion, two selective inhibitors of T(H)2 differentiation are full AhR agonists.

J.			Activation of estrogen receptor-mediated gene transcription by the equine estrogen metabolite, 4-methoxyequilenin, in human breast cancer cells	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							ARYL-HYDROCARBON RECEPTOR; CATECHOL-O-METHYLTRANSFERASE; IN-VITRO; AH-RECEPTOR; DNA-DAMAGE; ALPHA; ESTRADIOL; 4-HYDROXYEQUILENIN; ANTAGONIST; BINDING	4-Methoxyequilenin (4-MeOEN) is an O-methylated metabolite in equine estrogen metabolism. O-methylation of catechol estrogens is considered as a protective mechanism; however, comparison of the properties of 4-MeOEN with estradiol (E-2) in human breast cancer cells showed that 4-MeOEN is a proliferative, estrogenic agent that may contribute to carcinogenesis. 4-MeOEN results from O-methylation of 4-hydroxyequilenin, a major catechol metabolite of the equine estrogens present in hormone replacement therapeutics, which causes DNA damage via quinone formation, raising the possibility of synergistic hormonal and chemical carcinogenesis. 4-MeOEN induced cell proliferation with nanomolar potency and induced estrogen response element (ERE)-mediated gene transcription of an ERE-luciferase reporter and the endogenous estrogen-responsive genes pS2 and TGF-alpha. These estrogenic actions were blocked by the antiestrogen ICI 182,780. In the standard radioligand estrogen receptor (ER) binding assay, 4-MeOEN showed very weak binding. To test for alternate ligand-ER-independent mechanisms, the possibility of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) binding and ER-AhR cross talk was examined using a xenobiotic response element-luciferase reporter and using AhR small interfering RNA silencing in the ERE-luciferase reporter assay. The results negated the possibility of AhR-mediated estrogenic activity. Comparison of gene transcription time course, ER degradation, and rapid activation of MAPK/ERK in MCF-7 cells demonstrated that the actions of 4-MeOEN mirrored those of E-2 with potency for classical and nonclassical estrogenic pathways bracketing that of E-2. Methylation of 4-OHEN may not represent a detoxification pathway because 4-MeOEN is a full, potent estrogen agonist.

Interactions between conserved residues in transmembrane helices 2 and 7 during angiotensin AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation	CHEMICAL BIOLOGY & DRUG DESIGN			English	Article						angiotensin receptor type 1; G protein-coupled receptors; molecular modeling; site-directed mutagenesis	II TYPE-1 RECEPTOR; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; LIGAND-BINDING POCKET; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVATION; CONFORMATIONAL-ANALYSIS; ASPARAGINE RESIDUES; ENERGY PARAMETERS; HORMONE RECEPTOR; RHODOPSIN	Site-directed mutagenesis studies and independent molecular modeling studies were combined to investigate the network of inter-residue interactions within the transmembrane region of the angiotensin AT(1a) receptor. Site-directed mutagenesis was focused on residues Tyr292, Asn294, Asn295, and Asn298 in transmembrane helix 7, and the conserved Asp74 in helix 2 and other polar residues. Functional interactions between pairs of residues were evaluated by determining the effects of single and double-reciprocal mutations on agonist-induced AT1a receptor activation. Replacement of Tyr292 by aspartate in helix 7 abolished radioligand binding to both Y292D and D74Y/Y292D mutant receptors. Reciprocal mutations of Asp74/Asn294, Ser115/Asn294, Ser252/Asn294, and Asn298/Sen115 caused additive impairment of function, suggesting that these pairs of residues make independent contributions to AT1a receptor activation. In contrast, mutations of the Asp74/Tyr298 pair revealed that the D74N/N298D reciprocal mutation substantially increased the impaired inositol phosphate responses of the D74N and N298D receptors. Extensive molecular modeling yielded 3D models of the TM region of the AT(1) receptor and the mutants as well as of their complexes with angiotensin II, which were used to rationalize the possible reasons of impairing of function of some mutants. These data indicate that Asp74 and Asn298 are not optimally positioned for direct strong interaction in the resting conformation of the AT1a receptor. Balance of interactions between residues in helix 2 (as D74) and helix 7 (as N294, N295 and N298) in the AT1 receptors, however, has a crucial role both in determining their functional activity and levels of their expression.

A neurotransmitter dopamine signals via five different seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors termed D1 to D5. The secondary lymphoid tissues are highly innervated by sympathetic nerve fibers that store dopamine at high contents. Lymphocytes also produce dopamine. In this study, we examined expression and function of dopamine receptors in lymphocytes. We found that D3 was the predominant subtype of dopamine receptors in the secondary lymphoid tissues and selectively expressed by naive CD8(+) T cells of both humans and mice. Dopamine induced calcium flux and chemotaxis in mouse L1.2 cells stably expressing human D3. These responses were almost completely inhibited by pertussis toxin, indicating that D3 was coupled with the G alpha i class of G proteins. Consistently, dopamine selectively induced chemotactic responses in naive CD8(+) T cells of both humans and mice in a manner sensitive to pertussis toxin and D3 antagonists. Dopamine was highly synergistic with CCL19, CCL21, and CXCL12 in induction of chemotaxis in naive CD8(+) T cells. Dopamine selectively induced adhesion of naive CD8(+) T cells to fibronectin and ICAM-1 through activation of integrins. Intraperitoneal injection of mice with dopamine selectively attracted naive CD8(+) T cells into the peritoneal cavity. Treatment of mice with a D3 antagonist U-99194A selectively reduced homing of naive CD8(+) T cells into lymph nodes. Collectively, naive CD8(+) T cells selectively express D3 in both humans and mice, and dopamine plays a significant role in migration and homing of naive CD8(+) T cells via D3.

However, it has remained unclear if the alcohol-abuse related dopaminergic deficit is specifically associated with certain receptor subtype. The aim of this study was to compare putative alterations of dopamine D, receptors in caudate and putamen of nine type 1 alcoholics, eight type 2 alcoholics and 10 healthy controls by using [H-3]SCH 23390 as a radioligand in postmortem human whole hemisphere autoradiography. In addition, we compared the present results to our earlier studies on dopamine transporters and dopamine D-2 receptors in these same subjects and evaluated the putative correlations of dopamine D-1 receptor densities between the nucleus accumbens and the abovementioned structures. Our results show that alcoholics do not have significantly different striatal dopamine D-1 receptor densities compared to controls. Neither were there any significant correlations between the dopamine D-1 receptors and the two other dopamine binding sites. However, the correlations of the dopamine D-1 receptors between nucleus accumbens and dorsal striatal structures were consistently and mostly statistically significantly positive in alcoholics, but not in controls, which may suggest some pathology related to addiction. In addition, considering the facts that dopamine D-1 receptors were more abundant in the mesolimbic nucleus accumbens than in the caudate or putamen and that there was a strong tendency towards lower binding among type 1 alcoholics may suggest the importance of dopamine D, receptors in reward and/or alcoholism.

Animals-12 adult horses with heaves and healthy lung lobes from 20 slaughtered horses. Procedure-Lung lobes were used for smooth muscle tension and radioligand binding studies. Horses with heaves were given a placebo for 14 days and administered L-708,738 (n = 6; 2.5 mg/kg PO, q 12 h) or dexamethasone (6; 0.04 mg/kg, IV, q 24 h) from days 14 to 28. Pulmonary function was measured weekly for 36 days, and bronchoalveolar cells were collected on days 0, 14, and 29 for cytologic examination. Results-Nanomolar concentrations of L-708,738 were effective at antagonizing LTD4-induced bronchoconstriction and LTD4-receptor binding in lung lobes. Mean peak and trough L-708,738 plasma concentrations during the treatment period were 1.54 and 0.28 muM, respectively. On days 21 and 29, lung mechanics were significantly improved in the dexamethasone-treated horses but not in the L-708,738-treated horses. Neither dexamethasone nor L-708,738 had a significant effect on cytologic findings. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-L-708,738 was bioavailable after oral administration and sustained concentrations in plasma during the dosing period that exceeded in vitro efficacy values, However, airway function did not improve, suggesting that either drug concentrations in the lungs were subtherapeutic or that cysteinyl LT may not be important mediators of airway inflammation in heaves. Results provide the first evidence of cysteinyl LT1 receptors in airways of horses.

Surprisingly, the transient increase in Ins(1,4,5)P-3 did not trigger an increase in the concentration of intracellular calcium, as determined in vivo using the aequorin method. Similar Ins(1,4,5)P-3 signals were also observed in wild-type cells treated with the phospholipase C inhibitor 3-nitrocoumarin and in cells deleted for the only phospholipase C-encoding gene in yeast, PLC1. This showed clearly that Ins(1,4,5)P-3 was not generated by phospholipase C-dependent cleavage of PtdIns(4,5)P-2. Apart from a transient increase in Ins(1,4,5)P-3, we observed a transient increase in PtdIns(4,5)P2 after the addition of a nitrogen source to nitrogen-starved glucose-repressed cells. Inhibition by wortmannin of the phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase, Stt4, which is involved in PtdIns(4,5)P-2 formation, did not affect the Ins(1,4,5)P-3 signal, but significantly delayed the PtdIns(4,5)P-2 signal. Moreover, wortmannin addition inhibited the nitrogen-induced activation of trehalase and the subsequent mobilization of trehalose, suggesting a role for PtdIns(4,5)P-2 in nitrogen activation of the fermentable-growth-medium-induced signalling pathway.

We tested the hypothesis that LVAD support normalizes the ability of cardiac muscle to respond to sympathetic nervous system stimulation by reversing the downregulation of beta -adrenergic receptors. Methods and Results-Human LV tissue was obtained from nonfailing hearts of unmatched organ donors and failing hearts at the time of transplantation, with or without LVAD. Baseline contractile parameters and inotropic response to a beta -adrenergic agonist were measured in isolated trabecular muscles. P-Adrenergic receptor density was quantified by radioligand binding. Results showed a significant increase in the response to beta -adrenergic stimulation after LVAD (developed tension increased by 0.76 +/- 0.09 g/mm(2) in nonfailing, 0.38 +/- 0.07 in failing, and 0.68 +/- 0.10 in failing + LVAD; P < 0.01), accompanied by an increased density of P-adrenergic receptors (58.7 +/- 9.6 fmol/mg protein in nonfailing, 26.2 +/- 3.8 in failing, and 63.0 +/- 8.3 in failing + LVAD; P < 0.05). These changes were unrelated to the duration of support. Conclusions-Data demonstrate that mechanically supporting the failing human heart with an LVAD can reverse the downregulation of P-adrenergic receptors and restore the ability of cardiac muscle to respond to inotropic stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system. This indicates that functional impairment of cardiac muscle in human heart failure is reversible.

Thus, to characterize the binding site for dizocilpine on the AChR we examined 1) the dissociation constant (K-d) and stoichiometry of [H-3] dizocilpine binding; 2) the displacement of dizocilpine radioligand binding by noncompetitive inhibitors (NCIs) and conversely dizocilpine displacement of fluorescent and radiolabeled NCIs from their respective high-affinity binding sites on the AChR; and 3) photoaffinity labeling of the AChR using I-125-dizocilpine. The results establish that one high-affinity (K-d = 4.8 muM) and several (3-6) low-affinity (K-d = similar to 140 muM) binding sites exist for dizocilpine on the desensitized and resting AChR, respectively. The binding of the fluorescent NCIs ethidium, quinacrine, and crystal violet as well as [H-3]thienylcyclohexylpiperidine was inhibited by dizocilpine on desensitized AChRs. However, Schild-type analyses indicate that only the inhibition of quinacrine in the desensitized state seems to be mediated by a mutually exclusive action. Photoaffinity labeling of the AChR by I-125-dizocilpine was primarily restricted to the alpha1 subunit and subsequent mapping revealed that the principal sites of labeling are localized to the M4 (similar to 70%) and M1 (30%) transmembrane domains. Collectively, the data indicate that the high-affinity dizocilpine binding site is not located in the lumen of the ion channel but probably near the quinacrine binding locus at a nonluminal domain in the AChR desensitized state.

METHODS: SP was given intracerebroventricularly in anesthetized rabbits pretreated with the catecholaminergic neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA). The density and affinity of SP receptors on synaptosomal membranes of the hypothalamus and the ventral medulla of rabbits were determined by [I-125]SP receptor assay. Arterial blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. RESULTS: Intracerebroventricular (icv) pretreatment of rabbits with 6-OHDA, reduced norepinephrine in the hypothalamus (by 86.7 %) and in the ventral medulla (by 77.0 %) respectively. The presser response and tachycardia of these rabbits to icy SP (3.55 nmol kg(-1)) were attenuated. The density and the affinity of SP receptors in the hypothalamus and the ventral medulla of 6-OHDA-lesioned rabbits were decreased. The B-max (pmol g(-1) protein) of SP receptors in hypothalamus and the ventral medulla are 108 +/- 5, 35.9 +/- 2.2 in control group, and 42 +/- 18, 20 +/- 5 in B-OHDA-lesioned rabbits, respectively. K-d (nmol L-1) of SP receptors in the two regions are 0.015 +/- 0.004, 0.014 +/- 0.006 in control group and 0.029 +/- 0.001, 0.015 +/- 0.003 in 6-OHDA group. There is a significant difference of B-max (P < 0.01) and K-d(P < 0.01, P < 0.05) in both regions between 6-OHDA groups and control groups. CONCLUSION: The suits suggested that central norepinephrine pathways involved in the cardiovascular response to icy SP.

As adults, they recite the learned song pattern in a stereotyped manner. Previously, we demonstrated that central nervous system-associated cannabinoid receptors (CB1) are expressed in brain regions known to control both juvenile song learning and adult recitation of song. Here we extend these findings by establishing the zebra finch as a behavioral model to study cannabinoid pharmacology, showing that the cannabinoid agonist WIN55212-2 inhibits both adult song production and locomotor activity, effects that are antagonist-reversed. Through radioligand binding assays we investigated the pharmacology of a number of cannabinoid ligands representing all structural classes and established an affinity profile that can be compared with that of other species. To begin to characterize signal transduction mechanisms we isolated cDNA encoding the receptor protein. The zebra finch CB1 receptor (ZFCB1) is highly expressed in brain with amino acid sequence 92% identical to human CB1 receptor. Establishment of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably expressing ZFCB1 allowed demonstration that the cannabinoid agonist WIN55212-2 dose dependently and potently inhibits forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity (IC50 = 9.0 nM, maximum inhibition = 49% at 100 nM WIN55212-2, reversed by 1 mM SR141716A). Cyclase inhibition indicates that ZFCB1-mediated signal transduction is consistent with that of mammalian CB1 receptors. Overall, cannabinoid inhibition of adult song production and conserved pharmacology render the zebra finch a promising model to investigate cannabinoid effects on learning by juveniles.

Herein we studied: 1) the binding of I-125-labeled human ghrelin to membranes from human hypothalamus and pituitary gland; 2) the ability of human ghrelin (either octanoylated or desoctanoylated), as well as of some GHS and neuropeptides to compete with the radioligand, The saturation binding analysis showed, in both tissues, the existence of a single class of high-affinity binding sites with limited binding capacity. The B-max (maximal number of binding sites) values of ghrelin receptors in the hypothalamus were significantly greater (p<0.001) than those detected in the pituitary, whereas the Kd (dissociation constant) values in the two tissues were similar. I-125-ghrelin bound to hypothalamic membranes was displaced by ghrelin, hexarelin, MK-0677, various GHS antagonists (EP-803 17, [D-Arg(1)-D-Phe(5)-D-Trp(7,9)-Leu(11)]-substance P) and some natural (cortistatin-14) and synthetic (vapreotide) SRIH-14 agonists, In contrast, no competition was seen in the presence of GHRH-44, SRIH-14 or desoctanoylated ghrelin, a ghrelin precursor that is devoid of GH-releasing properties. In conclusion, this preliminary study firstly demonstrates that ghrelin needs octanoylation to bind its hypothalamo-pituitary receptors, These receptors are the specific binding sites for GHS and their antagonists, as well as for SRIH analogs (vapreotide, and cortistatin-14), but not for native SRIH.

However, more recent studies suggest that receptor function in AD may be compromised due to disrupted post-receptor signal transduction, in particular that mediated by the G-protein regulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis and adenylate cyclase (AC) pathways. The phosphoinositide hydrolysis pathway has been shown to be altered at a number of levels in AD post-mortem brains, including impaired agonist and G-protein regulation of phospholipase C, decreased protein kinase C (PKC) levels and activity, and a reduced number of receptor sites for the second messenger, Ins(1,4,5)P-3. Of these, loss of Ins(1,4,5)P-3 receptors and PKC in the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus correlates with AD-related neurofibrillary changes, as staged according to Braak's protocol. Disregulation of the phosphoinositide hydrolysis pathway may therefore have consequences for the progression of AD pathology. In contrast to the extensive pattern of disruption seen with the phosphoinositide hydrolysis pathway, changes to AC signalling in AD appear more circumscribed. Disruptions include a lesion at the level of G(S)-protein stimulation of AC and, at least in the hippocampus, reduced enzyme activities in response to forskolin stimulation. Of these, the latter change has been shown to precede neurofibrillary changes. Apart from a loss of calcium/calmodulin senstitive AC isoforms, other components of this signalling pathway, including G-protein levels, G(i)-protein mediated inhibition and protein kinase A levels and activity, remain relatively preserved in the disorder.

Ah the novel compounds were found to antagonize histamine in a competitive and reversible manner. When tested on guinea-pig ileum, compounds exhibited H-1-antagonistic activity, (pA(2) values) in the range of 8.6 to 9.7. Some of the lead compounds were evaluated by an in vivo method and were found to protect the guinea pigs against the histamine induced asphyxic shock at the doses comparable to or lower than those of the standard drugs, cetirizine (CAS 83881-51-0) and terfenadine (CAS 50679-08-8). The pA(2) acetylcholine values of some of the lead compounds reflect about 1000-fold selectivity for histamine (H,) receptors. The 4-aminopyrimidines (6) were found to be more selective than their 4-one analogs (4, 5). In the radioligand binding study, one of the lead compounds, 6e, was found to bind reversibly at the histamine H-1 receptor with the K-i value of 1.3 mu mol/l and IC50 of 3.8 mu mol/l. The lead compounds were found to have negligible sedative potential when tested in vivo. An indirect type of molecular modeling approach, using temelastine (CAS 86181-42-2) as the standard ligand, indicates that the potent activity of 4, 5 and 6 may be due to the increased spacer chain length between the pyrimidine nucleus and the sidechain aromatic ring.

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of chronic 17 beta-estradiol treatment on 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression and 5-HT1A receptor binding in ovariectomized female rats. Using in situ hybridization histochemistry, no alterations were found on the 5-HT1A receptor mRNA levels after the estradiol treatment (2 weeks). Radioligand autoradiographic studies using the selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist [H-3]WAY-100635 revealed reduced receptor binding in the amygdala, hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and motor cortex after estradiol treatment, whereas no changes were observed in the piriform or retrosplenial cortex. Thus, the previous findings together with the present results indicate that estradiol-induced alterations in 5-HT1A receptor mRNA expression appears within hours, but diminishes with chronic treatment when significant changes on the receptor-protein level are apparent. The effects of estradiol treatment on the 5-HT1A receptor binding in the limbic areas suggest that estrogen can modulate functions such as learning, memory, cognition, emotional processing, and social behavior. Consequently, estradiol modulation of 5-HT1A receptor circuits might be a possible pathway for the estrogen influence in the expression of psychiatric and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, affective disorders, and schizophrenia.

Unfortunately, not all PCa cells express PSMA. Therefore, alternative theranostic targets are required. The membrane protein prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) is highly overexpressed in most primary prostate carcinoma (PCa) cells and in metastatic and hormone refractory tumor cells. Moreover, PSCA expression positively correlates with tumor progression. Therefore, it represents a potential alternative theranostic target suitable for imaging and/or radioimmunotherapy. In order to support this working hypothesis, we conjugated our previously described anti-PSCA monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7F5 with the bifunctional chelator CHX-A ''-DTPA and subsequently radiolabeled it with the theranostic radionuclide Lu-177. The resulting radiolabeled mAb ([Lu-177]Lu-CHX-A ''-DTPA-7F5) was characterized both in vitro and in vivo. It showed a high radiochemical purity (>95%) and stability. The labelling did not affect its binding capability. Biodistribution studies showed a high specific tumor uptake compared to most non-targeted tissues in mice bearing PSCA-positive tumors. Accordingly, SPECT/CT images revealed a high tumor-to-background ratios from 16 h to 7 days after administration of [Lu-177]Lu-CHX-A ''-DTPA-7F5. Consequently, [Lu-177]Lu-CHX-A ''-DTPA-7F5 represents a promising candidate for imaging and in the future also for radioimmunotherapy.

Combined In Vivo Microdialysis and PET Studies to Validate [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Yohimbine Binding as a Marker of Noradrenaline Release	BIOMOLECULES			English	Article						a2 adrenoceptors; noradrenaline; microdialysis; minipig; positron emission tomography; [C-11]yohimbine	VAGUS NERVE-STIMULATION; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; LOCUS-COERULEUS; ALPHA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; NOREPINEPHRINE TRANSPORTER; BRAIN; ATLAS; PIG; ADRENOCEPTORS; TOMOGRAPHY	The noradrenaline system attracts attention for its role in mood disorders and neurodegenerative diseases but the lack of well-validated methods impairs our understanding when assessing its function and release in vivo. This study combines simultaneous positron emission tomography (PET) and microdialysis to explore if [C-11]yohimbine, a selective antagonist radioligand of the alpha 2 adrenoceptors, may be used to assess in vivo changes in synaptic noradrenaline during acute pharmacological challenges. Anesthetised Gottingen minipigs were positioned in a head holder in a PET/CT device. Microdialysis probes were placed in the thalamus, striatum and cortex and dialysis samples were collected every 10 min. Three 90 min [C-11]yohimbine scans were acquired: at baseline and at two timepoints after the administration of amphetamine (1-10 mg/kg), a non-specific releaser of dopamine and noradrenaline, or nisoxetine (1 mg/kg), a specific noradrenaline transporter inhibitor. [C-11]yohimbine volumes of distribution (V-T) were obtained using the Logan kinetic model. Both challenges induced a significant decrease in yohimbine V-T, with time courses reflecting their different mechanisms of action. Dialysis samples revealed a significant increase in noradrenaline extracellular concentrations after challenge and an inverse correlation with changes in yohimbine V-T. These data suggest that [C-11]yohimbine can be used to evaluate acute variations in synaptic noradrenaline concentrations after pharmacological challenges.

Therefore, SV2A positron emission tomography (PET) imaging may provide a unique tool to investigate synaptic density dynamics during disease progression and after therapeutic intervention. This study aims to extensively characterize the novel radioligand [F-18]SynVesT-1 for preclinical applications. In C57Bl/6J mice (n = 39), we assessed the plasma profile of [F-18]SynVesT-1, validated the use of a noninvasive image-derived input function (IDIF) compared to an arterial input function (AIF), performed a blocking study with levetiracetam (50 and 200 mg/kg, i.p.) to verify the specificity towards SV2A, examined kinetic models for volume of distribution (V-T) quantification, and explored test-retest reproducibility of [F-18]SynVesT-1 in the central nervous system (CNS). Plasma availability of [F-18]SynVesT-1 decreased rapidly (13.4 +/- 1.5% at 30 min post-injection). V-T based on AIF and IDIF showed excellent agreement (r(2) = 0.95, p < 0.0001) and could be reliably estimated with a 60-min acquisition. The blocking study resulted in a complete blockade with no suitable reference region. Test-retest analysis indicated good reproducibility (mean absolute variability <10%). In conclusion, [F-18]SynVesT-1 is selective for SV2A with optimal kinetics representing a candidate tool to quantify CNS synaptic density non-invasively.

Concentration, distribution, and influence of aging on the 18 kDa translocator protein in human brain: Implications for brain imaging studies	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Translocator protein TSPO; postmortem human brain; aging; multiple system atrophy; positron emission tomography	BENZODIAZEPINE BINDING-SITES; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE-B; DEPENDENT ANION CHANNEL; MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; LIGAND DAA1106 BINDS; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE; IN-VIVO; HIGH-AFFINITY; ACTIVATED MICROGLIA	Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the translocator protein (TSPO) is widely used as a biomarker of microglial activation. However, TSPO protein concentration in human brain has not been optimally quantified nor has its regional distribution been compared to TSPO binding. We determined TSPO protein concentration, change with age, and regional distribution by quantitative immunoblotting in autopsied human brain. Brain TSPO protein concentration (>0.1 ng/mu g protein) was higher than those reported by in vitro binding assays by at least 2 to 70 fold. TSPO protein distributed widely in both gray and white matter regions, with distribution in major gray matter areas ranked generally similar to that of PET binding in second-generation radiotracer studies. TSPO protein concentration in frontal cortex was high at birth, declined precipitously during the first three months, and increased modestly during adulthood/senescence (10%/decade; vs. 30% for comparison astrocytic marker GFAP). As expected, TSPO protein levels were significantly increased (+114%) in degenerating putamen in multiple system atrophy, providing further circumstantial support for TSPO as a gliosis marker. Overall, findings show some similarities between TSPO protein and PET binding characteristics in the human brain but also suggest that part of the TSPO protein pool might be less available for radioligand binding.

The effect of the EP3 antagonist DG-041 on male mice with diet-induced obesity	PROSTAGLANDINS & OTHER LIPID MEDIATORS			English	Article						Prostaglandin E-2; Ptger3; GPCR; Pharmacokinetics; Ligand binding; Obesity; Diabetes; Metabolic syndrome	METABOLIC SYNDROME; RECEPTOR; C57BL/6J; INHIBITION; PROTECTS; PATHWAY; ROLES	Background/aims: The prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) EP3 receptor has a multifaceted role in metabolism. Drugs targeting EP3 have been proposed as therapeutics for diabetes; however, studies utilizing global EP3 knockout mice suggest that EP3 blockade increases obesity and insulin resistance. The present studies attempt to determine the effect of acute EP3 antagonist treatment on the diabetic phenotype. Methods: DG-041 was confirmed to be a high affinity antagonist at the mouse EP3 receptor by competition radioligand binding and by blockade of EP3-mediated responses. DG-041 pharmacokinetic studies were performed to determine the most efficacious route of administration. Male C57BL/6 x BALB/c (CB6F1) mice were fed diets containing 10%, 45%, or 60% calories from fat to induce obesity. Changes to the metabolic phenotype in these mice were evaluated after one week treatment with DG-041. Results: Subcutaneous injections of DG-041 at 20 mg/kg blocked the sulprostone-evoked rise in mean arterial pressure confirming the efficacy of this administration regime. Seven day treatment with DG-041 had minimal effect on body composition or glycemic control. DG-041 administration caused a reduction in skeletal muscle triglyceride content while showing a trend toward increased hepatic triglycerides. Conclusion: Short term EP3 administration of DG-041 produced effective blockade of the EP3 receptor and decreased skeletal muscle triglyceride content but had no significant effects on the diabetic phenotype.

Comparative evaluation of 4 and 6-carbon spacer conformationally flexible tetrahydroisoquinolinyl benzamide analogues for imaging the sigma-2 receptor status of solid tumors	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						PET; Sigma-2 receptors; Tumor imaging; Tumor cell proliferation; EMT-6 cells	GUINEA-PIG BRAIN; BREAST-CANCER; IN-VITRO; PGRMC1 PROTEIN; OVARIAN-CANCER; BINDING-SITES; CELL-LINES; LIGANDS; PROLIFERATION; EXPRESSION	Introduction: Nine novel analogues were synthesized including a 6-carbon spacer analogue of ISO-1 (7). They have moderate binding affinity for sigma-2 (sigma(2)) receptors and high selectivity for sigma(2) receptors relative to sigma-1 (sigma(1)) receptors. Methods: ([F-18]7) was synthesized and evaluated as a candidate ligand for positron emission (PET) imaging of the sigma(2) receptor in tumors. Radioligand [F-18]7 was radiolabeled with F-18 via displacement of the corresponding mesylate precursor with r8FIfluoride. Cellular uptake study of [F-18]7 was performed in EMT-6 tumor cell, and in vivo biodistribution study of [F-18]7 and microPET imaging study of [F-18]3 and [F-18]7 carried out in female Balb/c mice bearing EMT-6 tumors. Results: [F-18]7 had a respectable tumor uptake (1.55%ID/g at 60 min post-injection) and high tumor/muscle ratios at 60 and 120 min post-injection. MicroPET imaging of [F-18]7 in tumor-bearing mice as above showed significant tumor localization and a high tumor/muscle ratio as well. Conclusions: These results are similar to or better than [F-18]ISO-1 ([F-18]3), which indicates that [F-18]7 has potential for imaging the sigma(2) receptor status of solid tumors.

The potencies of the different LHs and CGs were evaluated using areas under the curves (AUC) of their kinetics over 60 min stimulation. All mammalian LHs and CGs tested were found to stimulate CAMP accumulation in these cells. The reversibility of this stimulation was studied by removing the hormone from the culture medium after 10 min of incubation. The ratios of kinetics AUC after removing or not the hormone were used to evaluate the stimulation reversibility of each hormone. Natural and recombinant hLHs and hCGs were found to exhibit slowly reversible activation compared to pituitary rat, ovine, porcine, camel and equine LHs, serum-derived eCG (PMSG) and recombinant eLH/CGs. Carbohydrate side chains are not involved in this phenomenon since natural and recombinant homologous hormones exhibit the same reversibility rates. It is still unknown whether only one human subunit, alpha or beta, is responsible for this behaviour or whether it is due to a particular feature of the hLH and hCG quaternary structure.

The aim of this study was the development of the first NTS2 subtype selective F-18-labeled radioligand for imaging NTS2 expression in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). The radiosynthesis of glycopeptoid F-18-4 was realized by copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), applying the prosthetic group 6-deoxy-6-[F-18]fluoroglucosyl azide for F-18-fluoroglycosylation of the alkyne-terminated NT(8-13) analog Pra-N-Me-Arg-Arg-Pro-N-homo-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH. The binding affinity of the peptide-peptoid 4 for NTS2 was 7 nM with excellent subtype selectivity over NTS1 (260-fold). In vitro autoradiography studies of rat brain slices confirmed the high selectivity of F-18-4 for NTS2. Biodistribution experiments using HT29 and PC3 tumor-bearing nude mice revealed high renal and only moderate tumor uptake, while PET imaging experiments revealed specific binding of F-18-4 in NTS2-positive tumors. As F-18-4 displayed high stability in vitro but fast degradation in vivo, future work will focus on the development of metabolically more stable NT(8-13) analogs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Differential Diagnosis in Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia with Lewy Bodies via VMAT2 and Amyloid Imaging	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	10th International Conference on Alzheimers and Parkinsons Diseases (AD/PD)	MAR 09-13, 2011	Barcelona, SPAIN			Alzheimer's disease; Dementia with Lewy bodies; Amyloid imaging; Differential diagnosis	BETA; DENSITY; BODY	Background: The noninvasive evaluation of nigrostriatal dopaminergic integrity by PET can provide useful information for the differential diagnosis between dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Objectives: To evaluate the diagnostic potential of imaging striatal monoaminergic terminal integrity with the novel vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) radioligand [F-18]AV-133 and PET to distinguish DLB from AD. Methods: Fifty participants [9 DLB, 11 AD, 20 Parkinson's disease (PD) and 10 healthy age-matched control subjects (HC)] underwent [F-18]AV-133 PET studies. Additionally, 20 participants underwent amyloid imaging PET scans with either [C-11]PiB or F-18-florbetaben. VMAT2 density was calculated through normalized tissue uptake value ratios (R-T) at 120-140 min after injection using the primary visual or the cerebellar cortex as reference region. Comparison of the R T for [F-18]AV-133 was done between the different clinical diagnostic groups. Results: Significantly lower striatal VMAT2 densities were observed in DLB and PD when compared to AD and HC, especially in the posterior putamen. In contrast to PD and DLB, no reductions were observed in AD patients when compared to HC. Conclusions: [F-18] AV-133 allows assessment of nigrostriatal degeneration in Lewy body diseases. In contrast to amyloid imaging, VMAT2 imaging with [F-18]AV-133 can robustly detect reductions of dopaminergic nigrostriatal afferents in DLB patients, assisting in the differential diagnosis from AD.

Methods: Transient focal ischemia was induced by suture occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. Rats were intraperitoneally treated with a vehicle, 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline or idazoxan immediately after focal ischemia. Infarct volume was assessed by 2,3,5-triphenyltrazolium chloride staining and neurobehavioral deficits were monitored. The volume of cell death in the penumbra after ischemia was determined by immunostaining using anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibody and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Results: Both 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline and idazoxan significantly improved the neurological score compared with the vehicle at 24 hours after focal ischemia. Treatment with 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline or idazoxan also significantly reduced infarct volume and the number of both caspase-3- and TUNEL-positive cells in the penumbra compared with vehicle-treated rats (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: The results suggest the neuroprotective role of 2-(2-benzofuranyl)-2-imidazoline and idazoxan in focal cerebral ischemia, and may therefore represent useful targets for developing new treatments for stroke.

Its partition coefficients were determined in n-octanol and phosphate buffer (PB) (pH 7.0 and pH 7.4). 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) left-sided lesioned Parkinsonian rats were established and validated by rotational behavior tests. Biodistribution in vivo in mice, autoradiography in normal and hemi-Parkinsonian rat brains, and toxicity test were performed. The results showed that partition coefficients were 34.14 (pH 7.0) and 56.41 (pH 7.4), respectively. Biodistribution exhibited rapid uptake and favorable retention in the mice brains. The major radioactivity was metabolized by the hepatic system. The autoradiography showed that F-18-FECNT was highly concentrated in striatum, and that the left and the right striatal uptake were symmetrical in normal SD rat brains. In left-sided lesioned PD rat brains, the striatal uptake of F-18-FECNT bilaterally decreased in comparison with normal rats. No significant uptake was visible in the 6-OHDA lesioned-sided striatal areas. The results demonstrated that F-18-FECNT binds to DAT was specific. Toxicity trial displayed that the acceptable dose per kilogram to mice was 625 times greater than that to human. These indicate that F-18-FECNT is a potentially safe and useful DAT PET imaging agent in the brain.

A hydrogen bond in loop a is critical for the binding and function of the 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; AMINO-ACID MUTAGENESIS; AGONIST-BINDING; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(3A) RECEPTOR; EXTRACELLULAR DOMAIN; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SITE; RESIDUES; ANTAGONIST; REVEALS	The binding sites of Cys-loop receptors are formed from at least six loops (A-F). Here we have used mutagenesis, radioligand binding, voltage clamp electrophysiology, and homology modeling to probe the role of two residues in loop A of the 5-HT3 receptor: Asn128 and Glu129. The data show that substitution of Asn128, with a range of alternative natural and unnatural amino acids, changed the EC50 (from similar to 10-fold more potent to similar to 10-fold less potent than that of the wild type), increased the maximal peak current for mCPBG compared to 5-HT (R-max) 2-19-fold, and decreased n(H), indicating this residue is involved in receptor gating; we propose Asn128 faces away from the binding pocket and plays a role in facilitating transitions between conformational states. Substitutions of Glu129 resulted in functional receptors only when the residue could accept a hydrogen bond, but with both these and other substitutions, no [H-3]granisetron binding could be detected, indicating a role in ligand binding. We propose that Glu129 faces into the binding pocket, where, through its ability to hydrogen bond, it plays a critical role in ligand binding. Thus, the data support a modified model of the 5-HT3 receptor binding site and show that loop A plays a critical role in both the ligand binding and function of this receptor.

Both EGFR and HER2 genes are overexpressed in a variety of solid human cancers and are related to poor prognosis of the patients. The objective of this work was to evaluate the EGFR and HER2 contents in resectable gastric cancer, their possible relationship with clinicopathologic parameters of tumors, and their prognostic significance. Methods: This was a prospective analysis of 63 patients with resectable gastric carcinomas, with a mean follow-up period of 40.7 months. Membranous EGFR levels were examined by radioligand binding assays, and cytosolic HER2 levels were examined by means of an immunoenzymatic assay. Results: There was a wide variability of EGFR (1-1,239 fmol/mg of protein) and HER2 (7-20,863 NHU/mg of protein) levels in tumors. There was no significant correlation between these levels and patient or tumor characteristics. However, high levels of EGFR and HER2 were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival period (P = .03 and P = .02, respectively). Conclusions: There is a wide variability in membranous EGFR levels and in cytosolic HER2 levels in gastric cancer, which seems to be related to the biological heterogeneity of these tumors. In addition, high tumor EGFR and HER2 levels were associated with an unfavorable outcome in patients with resectable gastric cancer.

Organ-specific distribution pattern and subtype-specific effects are known but not fully understood. To address a cell-type specific expression pattern in the heart we investigated expression pattern of alpha (1)-AR subtypes on RNA- and protein-level in heart tissue, cultured cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes of the rat. Each alpha (1)AR-subtype mRNA was present in neonatal and adult rat heart culture but the relative distribution pattern was significantly different. While the alpha (1a)-AR subtype is preferentially expressed in adult cardiomyocytes, the alpha (1b)-AR subtype was preferentially expressed in the non-myocyte cell fraction. The RT-PCR results were confirmed by Western-blotting (alpha (1b)) and immunocytochemical studies. Incubation with an alpha (1)-agonist (phenylephrine) for 72 h led to a significant reduction of the alpha (1b)-AR in neonatal heart cell culture on both mRNA and protein level. In contrast, incubation with an alpha (1)-antagonist (prazosin) induced a 1.6 fold upregulation of the alpha (1a)-AR mRNA without significant effects on radioligand binding and functional assay. The results indicate a distribution pattern of the alpha (1)-AR subtype which is specific for cell type and ontogeny of the rat heart and may be regulated by adrenergic agents.

Several small-molecule moieties (FAPI-04, FAPI-46, etc.) are used for developing FAPtargeted theranostic agents. Nonetheless, the circulation time of FAP inhibitors is relatively short, resulting in rapid clearance via kidneys, low tumor uptake, and associated unsatisfactory treatment efficacy. To address the existing drawbacks, we engineered 3 peptides named FD1, FD2, and FD3 with different circulation times through solid-phase peptide synthesis. All the 3 reported peptides bind to human and murine FAP with single-digit nanomolar affinity measured by surface plasmon resonance. The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of the agents labeled with 68Ga and 177Lu was assessed in several tumor models exhibiting different levels of FAP expression. While radiolabeled FD1 was rapidly excreted from kidneys, radiolabeled FD2/FD3 have significantly prolonged circulation, increased tumor uptake, and decreased kidney accumulation. Our findings indicated that [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 positron emission tomography (PET) effectively detected FAP dynamics, whereas [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD2 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD3 exhibited remarkable therapeutic efficacy in FAP-overexpressing tumor models, including pancreatic cancer cell models characterized by abundant stroma. Moreover, a pilot translational investigation demonstrated that [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 had the capability to identify both primary and metastatic tumors with precision and distinction. In summary, we developed [68Ga]Ga-DOTA-FD1 for same-day PET imaging of FAP dynamics and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD2 and [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-FD3 for effective radioligand therapy of FAP-overexpressing tumors.

This growing interest has recently focused on rare (less abundant) pCBs that are non-psychotropic compounds, such as cannabigerol (CBG), cannabichromene (CBC), Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV) and cannabigerolic acid (CBGA). Notably, pCBs can act via the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which is involved in the regulation of key pathophysiological processes, and also in the skin. In this study, we used human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) as an in vitro model that expresses all major ECS elements in order to systematically investigate the effects of CBG, CBC, THCV and CBGA. To this end, we analyzed the gene and protein expression of ECS components (receptors: CB1, CB2, GPR55, TRPV1 and PPAR alpha/gamma/delta; enzymes: NAPE-PLD, FAAH, DAGL alpha/beta and MAGL) using qRT-PCR and Western blotting, along with assessments of their functionality using radioligand binding and activity assays. In addition, we quantified the content of endocannabinoid(-like) compounds (AEA, 2-AG, PEA, etc.) using UHPLC-MS/MS. Our results demonstrated that rare pCBs modulate the gene and protein expression of distinct ECS elements differently, as well as the content of endocannabinoid(-like) compounds. Notably, they all increased CB1/2 binding, TRPV1 channel stimulation and FAAH and MAGL catalytic activity. These unprecedented observations should be considered when exploring the therapeutic potential of cannabis extracts for the treatment of human skin diseases.

Differentiating tumor regrowth (TR) from RN is vital in management but difficult to assess using MRI. We hypothesized that tumor methionine levels would be elevated given increased metabolism and high amino acid uptake, whereas RN would increase inflammation marked by upregulated translocator protein (PBR-TSPO), which can be quantified with specific PET tracers. Procedures: We performed a feasibility study to prospectively evaluate [C-11]methionine and [C-11]PBR28 using PET in 5 patients with 7 previously SRS-treated brain metastases demonstrating regrowth to differentiate TR from RN. Results: Sequential imaging with dual tracers was well-tolerated. [C-11]methionine was accurate for detecting pathologically confirmed TR in 7/7 lesions, whereas [C-11]PBR28 was only accurate in 3/7 lesions. Tumor PBR-TSPO expression was elevated in both melanoma and lung cancer cells, contributing to lack of specificity of [C-11]PBR28-PET. Conclusion: Sequential use of PET tracers is safe and effective. [C-11]Methionine was a reliable TR marker, but [C-11]PBR28 was not a reliable marker of RN. Studies are needed to determine the causes of post-radiation inflammation and identify specific markers of RN to improve diagnostic imaging.

This study's aim is to investigate structurally related 2-benzylidene-1-indanones with substitutions on ring A and B as novel, potent and selective adenosine A (1) and A (2A) receptor blockers. 2-Benzylidene-1-indanone derivatives were synthesised via acid catalysed aldol condensation reactions and evaluated via radioligand binding assays to ascertain structure activity relationships to govern A (1) and A (2A) AR affinity. The results indicated that hydroxy substitution at C4 of ring A and meta (3'), or para (4') substitution on ring B of the 2-benzylidene-1-indanone scaffold ( 2c ) is preferred over substitution at C5 ( 2d ) or C6 ( 2e ) of ring A for adenosine A (1) receptor activity and selectivity in the micromolar range. Furthermore, substitution at the meta (3') position of ring B with chlorine lead to the highly potent and selective adenosine A (2A) receptor antagonist, compound 2h . Compound 2c and the 2q behaved as adenosine A (1) receptor antagonists in the performed GTP shift assays. In view of these findings, compounds 2c , 2h , 2q and 2p are potent and selective adenosine A (1) and A (2A) receptor antagonists for the potential treatment of neurological conditions.

The 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> Receptor PET Radioligand <SUP>11</SUP>C-CUMI-101 Has Significant Binding to α<sub>1</sub>-Adrenoceptors in Human Cerebellum, Limiting Its Use as a Reference Region	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						autoradiography; 5-HT1A receptor; CUMI-101; cerebellum; alpha(1)-adrenoceptor; cross-reactivity	BRAIN; DISEASE; LIGAND	Prazosin, a potent and selective ai-adrenoceptor antagonist, displaces 25% of C-11-CUMI-101 ([O-methyl-C-11]2-(4-(4-(2-methoxy-phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione) binding in monkey cerebellum. We sought to estimate the percentage contamination of C-11-CUMI-101 binding to al-adrenoceptors in human cerebellum under in vivo conditions. In vitro receptor-binding techniques were used to measure alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density and the affinity of CUMI-101 for these receptors in human, monkey, and rat cerebellum. Methods: Binding potential (maximum number of binding sites x affinity [(1/dissociation constant]) was determined using in vitro homogenate binding assays in human, monkey, and rat cerebellum. H-3-prazosin was used to determine the maximum number of binding sites, as well as the dissociation constant of H-3-prazosin and the inhibition constant of CUMI-101. Results: alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density and the affinity of CUMI-101 for these receptors were similar across species. Cerebellar binding potentials were 3.7 for humans, 2.3 for monkeys, and 3.4 for rats. Conclusion: Reasoning by analogy, 25% of C-11-CUMI-101 uptake in human cerebellum reflects binding to alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, suggesting that the cerebellum is of limited usefulness as a reference tissue for quantification in human studies.

Methods: Dynamic nu scans were acquired from male rhesus monkeys over 120 min, at baseline and after the acute administration of dizocilpine (MK-801, 0.3 mg/1<g; n = 3/condition). Continuous and discrete arterial blood samples were manually obtained, to generate metabolite-corrected input functions. Parametric volumeof-distribution (VT) images were obtained using Logan analysis. The selectivity profile of PK-209 was assessed in vitro, on a broad screen of 79 targets. Results: PK-209 was at least 50-fold more selective for NMDArs over all other targets examined. At baseline, prolonged retention of radioactivity was observed in NMDAr-rich cortical regions relative to the cerebellum. Pretreatment with MK-801 reduced the VT of [18F]PK-209 compared with baseline in two of three subjects. The rate of radioligand metabolism was high, both at baseline and after MK-801 administration. Conclusions: PK-209 targets the intrachannel site with high selectivity. Imaging of the NMDAr is feasible with [18F]PK-209, despite its fast metabolism. Further in vivo evaluation in humans is warranted. 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Golla, Sandeep S. V.; Klein, Pieter J.; Schuit, Robert C.; Christiaans, Johannes A. M.; Kooijman, Esther J.

Radiosynthesis, <i>In Vivo</i> Biological Evaluation, and Imaging of Brain Lesions with [<SUP>123</SUP>I]-CLINME, a New SPECT Tracer for the Translocator Protein	DISEASE MARKERS			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BINDING-SITES; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; PHARMACOLOGICAL EVALUATION; RAT-BRAIN; 18 KDA; PET; LOCALIZATION; RADIOLIGAND	The high affinity translocator protein (TSPO) ligand 6-chloro-2-(4'-iodophenyl)-3-(N,N-methylethyl)imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine-3-acetamide (CLINME) was radiolabelled with iodine-123 and assessed for its sensitivity for the TSPO in rodents. Moreover neuroinflammatory changes on a unilateral excitotoxic lesion rat model were detected using SPECT imaging. [I-123]-CLINME was prepared in 70-80% radiochemical yield. The uptake of [I-123]-CLINME was evaluated in rats by biodistribution, competition, and metabolite studies. The unilateral excitotoxic lesion was performed by injection of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid unilaterally into the striatum. The striatum lesion was confirmed and correlated with TSPO expression in astrocytes and activated microglia by immunohistochemistry and autoradiography. In vivo studies with [I-123]-CLINME indicated a biodistribution pattern consistent with TPSO distribution and the competition studies with PK11195 and Ro 5-4864 showed that [I-123]-CLINME is selective for this site. The metabolite study showed that the extractable radioactivity was unchanged [I-123]CLINME in organs which expresses TSPO. SPECT/CT imaging on the unilateral excitotoxic lesion indicated that the mean ratio uptake in striatum (lesion : nonlesion) was 2.2. Moreover, TSPO changes observed by SPECT imaging were confirmed by immunofluorescence, immunochemistry, and autoradiography. These results indicated that [I-123]-CLINME is a promising candidate for the quantification and visualization of TPSO expression in activated astroglia using SPECT.

Translocator Protein 18 kDa (TSPO) Is Regulated in White and Brown Adipose Tissue by Obesity	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; BINDING-SITES; EXPRESSION; FAT; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; THERMOGENESIS; MACROPHAGES; CHANNEL; MICE	Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) is an outer-mitochondrial membrane transporter which has many functions including participation in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), production of cellular energy, and is the rate-limiting step in the uptake of cholesterol. TSPO expression is dysregulated during disease pathologies involving changes in tissue energy demands such as cancer, and is up-regulated in activated macrophages during the inflammatory response. Obesity is associated with decreased energy expenditure, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflammation which collectively contribute to the development of the Metabolic Syndrome. Therefore, we hypothesized that dysregulation of TSPO in adipose tissue may be a feature of disease pathology in obesity. Radioligand binding studies revealed a significant reduction in TSPO ligand binding sites in mitochondrial extracts from both white (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) in mouse models of obesity (diet-induced and genetic) compared to control animals. We also confirmed a reduction in TSPO gene expression in whole tissue extracts from WAT and BAT. Immunohistochemistry in WAT confirmed TSPO expression in adipocytes but also revealed high-levels of TSPO expression in WAT macrophages in obese animals. No changes in TSPO expression were observed in WAT or BAT after a 17 hour fast or 4 hour cold exposure. Treatment of mice with the TSPO ligand PK11195 resulted in regulation of metabolic genes in WAT. Together, these results suggest a potential role for TSPO in mediating adipose tissue homeostasis.

FDG-PET imaging reveals local brain glucose utilization is altered by class I histone deacetylase inhibitors	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						Metabolism; Epigenetic; Chromatin; Rat; Necuroimaging; Acetylation	RAT; DEPRESSION; PLASTICITY; PROTOCOL; BEHAVIOR; NUCLEUS; PREDICT; TRIAL; HDAC	The purpose of this work - the first of its kind - was to evaluate the impact of chronic selective histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor treatment on brain activity using uptake of the radioligand F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography ((18)FDG-PET). HDAC dysfunction and other epigenetic mechanisms are implicated in diverse CNS disorders and animal research suggests HDAC inhibition may provide a lead toward developing improved treatment. To begin to better understand the role of the class I HDAC subtypes HDAC 1, 2 and 3 in modulating brain activity, we utilized two benzamide inhibitors from the literature, compound 60 (Cpd-60) and CI-994 which selectively inhibit HDAC 1 and 2 or HDACs 1, 2 and 3, respectively. One day after the seventh treatment with Cpd-60 (22.5 mg/kg) or CI-994 (5 mg/kg), (18)FDG-PET experiments (n = 11-12 rats per treatment group) revealed significant, local changes in brain glucose utilization. These 2-17% changes were represented by increases and decreases in glucose uptake. The pattern of changes was similar but distinct between Cpd-60 and CI-994, supporting that (18)FDG-PET is a useful tool to examine the relationship between HDAC subtype activity and brain activity. Further work using additional selective HDAC inhibitors will be needed to clarify these effects as well as to understand how brain activity changes influence behavioral response.

The neural underpinnings of IIV remain largely unknown. The neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) is of particular interest here, as human populations that exhibit DA alterations, such as the elderly, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder children, persons with schizophrenia, and Parkinson patients, also show increased behavioral IIV. We examined links between DA D-1 binding potential (BP) in multiple brain regions and IIV for the control and interference conditions of the Multi-Source Interference Task (MSIT), tapping the cingulo-fronto-parietal attention network. Participants were 18 young and 20 healthy old adults. PET and the radioligand [C-11]SCH23390 were used to determine D-1 BP. The intraindividual standard deviation (ISD) was computed across successful latency trials of the MSIT conditions, independent of mean RT differences due to age, trial, and condition. Increasing ISDs were associated with increasing age and diminished D-1 binding in several brain regions (anterior cingulate gyrus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex) for the interference, but not control, condition. Analyses of partial associations indicate that the association between age and IIV in the interference condition was linked to D-1 receptor losses in task-relevant brain regions. These findings suggest that dysfunctional DA modulation may contribute to increased variability in cognitive performance among older adults.	[MacDonald, Stuart W.

[C-11]CB-119 was synthesized with high specific activity by alkylation of a phenolic precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide. In vitro autoradiographic studies using rhesus brain slices were carried out using [H-3]CB-119, and in vivo imaging studies were carried out using [C-11]CB-119 in rhesus monkeys under baseline and blocked conditions. Autoradiographic studies in rhesus brain showed the expected distribution pattern for CB1R with highest binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, caudate/putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Lower binding was seen in the posterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and periventricular gray area, and the lowest binding was in the thalamic nuclei. The binding of [H-3]CB-119 was fully blocked by the addition of 10 mu M CB-119. Rhesus positron emission tomography imaging studies showed very good brain uptake and a distribution pattern consistent with that seen in the autoradiographic studies. The kinetics of tracer uptake was slow. The brain uptake was blocked by pretreatment with taranabant, a CB1R inverse agonist. The specific signal (total/nonspecific) in rhesus putamen at 90 min was similar to 6:1. [C-11]CB-119 is a suitable tracer for imaging central CB1 receptors.

Thiol Antioxidants Regulate Angiotensin II AT1 and Arginine Vasopressin V1 Receptor Functions Differently in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION			English	Article							EPIDERMAL-GROWTH-FACTOR; PROTEIN-KINASE ACTIVATION; EXTRACELLULAR DOMAINS; DISULFIDE BRIDGES; RAT; IDENTIFICATION; RESIDUES; BINDING; TRANSACTIVATION; INCREASES	BACKGROUND We compared the effects of the sulfhydryl-containing (thiol) antioxidant dithiothreitol (DTT), which disrupts disulfide bonds, on cell signaling through angiotensin II (Angll) Type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) and arginine vasopressin (AVP)V1 receptors (V1Rs). The AT1R contains two extracellular disulfides bonds but its ligand contains none, whereas the V1R contains no extracellular disufides bonds but its ligand contains 1. METHODS We measured radioligand binding, intracellular calcium responses, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells and alterations in urine osmolality in intact rats. RESULTS Preincubation of cells with DTT, a maneuver designed to target receptor disulfides, resulted in concentration-dependent decreases in specific I-125-Angll binding to AT1Rs and acute angiotensin-stimulated intracellular calcium mobilization but no decreases in specific I-125-AVP binding to V1Rs or AVP-stimulated intracellular calcium mobilization. In contrast, preincubation of the ligands with DTT followed by acute exposure to the cells, a maneuver designed to target ligand disulfides, blunted calcium mobilization to AVP robustly but to Angll only minimally. In intact rats, the increase in urine osmolality caused by subcutaneous injection with the AVP analogue desmopressin was significantly diminished when the analogue was preincubated with an excess of DTT. CONCLUSION DTT inhibits cell signaling to Angll AT1Rs and AVPV1Rs, at least in part through disruption of disulfide linkages, but the pattern of response depends upon whether disulfides of ligand or receptor are targeted.

We investigated the effects of transforming growth factor (TGF)-betas on morphological and receptor phenotypes, as well as proliferation of four currently established human prostatic myofibroblast cell lines and one commercially available prostatic stromal cell line. METHODS. The effects of TGF-betas on morphological changes and proliferation of the cells were studied by immunohistochemistry and bromodeoxyuridine assay, respectively. The expression of alpha 1-receptor subtypes was measured by real time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the radioligand binding assay for the receptors was also performed. RESULTS. TGF-betas 1, 2, and 3 induced expression of desmin and myosin of cells of the established cell lines, and significantly inhibited their growth. The alpha 1a-receptor was expressed only in the commercially available cell line and alpha 1b and 1d, in all cell lines. TGF-beta 1 suppressed the expression of all three subtypes of the alpha 1-receptor. The binding sites of cells of all the cell lines were reduced by treatment with this growth factor. CONCLUSIONS. TGF-betas may induce human prostatic stromal cells to express the smooth muscle phenotype and inhibited their growth. However, the growth factor reduced the binding sites of the receptor and suppressed mRNA expression of its subtypes, suggesting that morphological and receptor phenotypes may be regulated via more than one pathway by TGF-beta(s).

Rats were deprived of REM sleep for 96 hours by a small pedestal (water tank) method. Using radioligand assays with the selective antagonist [H-3]PK11195, receptor density (Bmax) and affinity were measured in the heart and kidney in three groups: 1) REMSD group (REM sleep deprived-group), 2) TC group (tank control group; large pedestal), and 3) CC group (cage control group). REMSD group showed an increase in the density of PBRs in the heart (18%; p<0.002), but not in the kidney (-5%; p=0.058) compared to TC group, and TC group showed an increase in the density of these receptors in the heart (17%; p<0.014), and the kidney (12%; p<0.002) compared to CC group. While the cardiac Kd value was 37% (p<0.0004) and 36% (p<0.002) higher in the REMSD group than in the CC and TC groups, respectively, the renal Kd value was lower (-5%; p=0.057 and -16%; p<0.0004, respectively). The changes in PBRs observed herein are tissue- and treatment-specific, and may suggest a close functional relationship between REM sleep and PBRs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

We recently developed the new radioligand [C-11]FLB 457, which is suitable for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of extrastriatal D2 dopamine receptors. The purpose of this PET study was to examine the effect of amphetamine on [11C]FLB 457 binding in extrastriatal regions. Each of three cynomolgus monkeys was examined at baseline conditions, 15 min and 3 h after I.V. injection of amphetamine (2 mg/kg). The effect of amphetamine was calculated from the ratio of specific [C-11]FLB 457 binding to the binding in the cerebellum, a region which was used as reference for free and nonspecific binding in the brain. The changes of the ratio in the striatum, the thalamus, and the neocortex were between -1.2% and -15.5% at 15 min and -2.1% and -16.3% at 3 h, respectively, after amphetamine administration. The reductions of the binding ratios in the extrastriatal regions are similar to those reported for [C-11]raclopride binding in the striatum. These data in a limited series of monkeys suggest that [C-11]FLB 457 binding to D2 dopamine receptors in extrastriatal regions is sensitive to changes in the concentration of endogenous dopamine.

However, we found that rDsg3-Ig-His absorbs autoantibodies to different antigens, including a non-Dsg 3 keratinocyte protein of 130 kDa. This prompted our search for novel targets of PV autoimmunity. The PV IgG eluted from a 75-kDa keratinocyte protein band both stained epidermis in a pemphigus-like pattern and induced acantholysis in keratinocyte monolayers. Screening of a keratinocyte lambda gt11 cDNA library with this antibody identified clones carrying cDNA inserts encoding a novel molecule exhibiting similar to 40% similarity with annexin-2, named pemphaxin (PX). Recombinant PX (rPX-His) was produced in Escherichia coli M15 cells, and, because annexins can act as cholinergic receptors, its conformation was tested in a cholinergic radioligand binding assay, rPX-His specifically bound [H-3]acetylcholine, suggesting that PX is one of the keratinocyte cholinergic receptors known to be targeted by disease-causing PV antibodies. Preabsorption of PV sera with rPX-His eliminated acantholytic activity, and eluted antibody immunoprecipitated native PX This antibody alone did not cause skin blisters in vivo, but its addition to the preabsorbed PV IgG fraction restored acantholytic activity, indicating that acantholysis in PV results from synergistic action of antibodies to different keratinocyte self-antigens, including both acetylcholine receptors and desmosomal cadherins.

[F-18]TRACK is the first PET radioligand for TrkB/C with proven in vivo brain penetration and on-target specific signal. Here we report dosimetry data for [F-18]TRACK in healthy humans. 6 healthy participants (age 22-61 y, 3 female) were scanned on a General Electric Discovery PET/CT 690 scanner. [F-18]TRACK was synthesized with high molar activities (A(m) = 250 +/- 75 GBq/mu mol), and a dynamic series of 12 whole-body scans were acquired after injection of 129 to 147 MBq of the tracer. Images were reconstructed with standard corrections using the manufacturer's OSEM algorithm. Tracer concentration time-activity curves (TACs) were obtained using CT-derived volumes-of-interest. Organ-specific doses and the total effective dose were estimated using the Committee on Medical Internal Radiation Dose equation for adults and tabulated Source tissue values (S values).Results: Average organ absorbed dose was highest for liver and gall bladder with 6.1E-2 (+/- 1.06E-2) mGy/MBq and 4.6 (+/- 1.18E-2) mGy/MBq, respectively. Total detriment weighted effective dose E-DW was 1.63E-2 +/- 1.68E-3 mSv/MBq. Organ-specific TACs indicated predominantly hepatic tracer elimination.Conclusion: Total and organ-specific effective doses for [F-18]TRACK are low and the dosimetry profile is similar to other F-18-labelled radio tracers currently used in clinical settings.

Arachidonoylcholine and Other Unsaturated Long-Chain Acylcholines Are Endogenous Modulators of the Acetylcholine Signaling System	BIOMOLECULES			English	Article						nAChR; arachidonoylcholine; oleoylcholine; acylcholines; acetylcholinesterase	HUMAN BUTYRYLCHOLINESTERASE; CHOLINERGIC SYSTEM; RECEPTORS; DOCKING; CANCER	y Cholines acylated with unsaturated fatty acids are a recently discovered family of endogenous lipids. However, the data on the biological activity of acylcholines remain very limited. We hypothesized that acylcholines containing residues of arachidonic (AA-CHOL), oleic (Ol-CHOL), linoleic (Ln-CHOL), and docosahexaenoic (DHA-CHOL) acids act as modulators of the acetylcholine signaling system. In the radioligand binding assay, acylcholines showed inhibition in the micromolar range of both alpha 7 neuronal nAChR overexpressed in GH4C1 cells and muscle type nAChR from Torpedo californica, as well as Lymnaea stagnalis acetylcholine binding protein. Functional response was checked in two cell lines endogenously expressing alpha 7 nAChR. In SH-SY5Y cells, these compounds did not induce Ca2+ rise, but inhibited the acetylcholine-evoked Ca2+ rise with IC50 9 to 12 mu M. In the A549 lung cancer cells, where alpha 7 nAChR activation stimulates proliferation, Ol-CHOL, Ln-CHOL, and AA-CHOL dose-dependently decreased cell viability by up to 45%. AA-CHOL inhibited human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and horse serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) by a mixed type mechanism with K-i = 16.7 +/- 1.5 mu M and alpha K-i = 51.4 +/- 4.1 mu M for AChE and K-i = 70.5 +/- 6.3 mu M and alpha K-i = 214 +/- 17 mu M for BChE, being a weak substrate of the last enzyme only, agrees with molecular docking results. Thus, long-chain unsaturated acylcholines could be viewed as endogenous modulators of the acetylcholine signaling system.

The present study explored the molecular mechanisms underlying gelsemine- and koumine-induced mechanical antiallodynia in neuropathic pain. The radioligand binding and displacement assays indicated that gelsemine and koumine, like glycine, were reversible and orthosteric agonists of glycine receptors with full efficacy and probably acted on same binding site as the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine. Treatment with gelsemine, koumine and glycine in primary cultures of spinal neurons (but not microglia or astrocytes) concentration dependently increased 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid oxidoreductase (3 alpha-HSOR) mRNA expression, which was inhibited by pretreatment with strychnine but not the glial inhibitor minocycline. Intrathecal injection of gelsemine, koumine and glycine stimulated 3 alpha-HSOR mRNA expression in the spinal cords of neuropathic rats and produced mechanical antiallodynia. Their spinal mechanical antiallodynia was completely blocked by strychnine, the selective 3 alpha-HSOR inhibitor medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), 3 alpha-HSOR gene silencer siRNA/3 alpha-HSOR and specific GABA(A) receptor antagonist isoallopregnanolone, but not minocycline. All the results taken together uncovered that gelsemine and koumine are orthosteric agonists of glycine receptors, and produce mechanical antiallodynia through neuronal glycine receptor/3 alpha-HSOR/allopregnanolone/GABA(A) receptor pathway.

Expression of this enzyme increases in inflammation. Therefore, the development of probes for imaging COX-2 with positron emission tomography (PET) has gained interest because they could be useful for the study of inflammation in vivo, and for aiding anti-inflammatory drug development targeting COX-2. Nonetheless, effective PET radioligands are still lacking. We synthesized eleven COX-2 inhibitors based on a 2(4-methylsulfonylphenyl)pyrimidine core from which we selected three as prospective PET radioligands based on desirable factors, such as high inhibitory potency for COX-2, very low inhibitory potency for COX-1, moderate lipophilicity, and amenability to labeling with a positron-emitter. These inhibitors, namely 6-methoxy-2-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl-N-(thiophen-2ylmethyl)pyrimidin-4-amine (17), the 6-fluoromethyl analogue (20), and the 6-(2-fluoroethoxy) analogue (27), were labeled in useful yields and with high molar activities by treating the 6-hydroxy analogue (26) with [C-11]iodomethane, [F-18]2-fluorobromoethane, and [d(2)-F-18]fluorobromomethane, respectively. [C-11]17, [F-18]20, and [d(2)-F-18]27 were readily purified with HPLC and formulated for intravenous injection. These methods allow these radioligands to be produced for comparative evaluation as PET radioligands for measuring COX-2 in healthy rhesus monkey and for assessing their abilities to detect inflammation.

A preliminary study of dopamine D<sub>2/3</sub> receptor availability and social status in healthy and cocaine dependent humans imaged with [<SUP>11</SUP>C](+)PHNO	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Dopamine; Cocaine; Social status; PET imaging; [C-11](+)PHNO	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; AGE-RELATED DECLINE; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; BINDING CHARACTERISTICS; BRAIN DOPAMINE; D-3 RECEPTORS; D3 RECEPTORS; AGONIST; MONKEYS; PET	Background: Previous work in healthy non-human primates and humans has shown that social status correlates positively with dopamine 2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability imaged with antagonist radioligands and positron emission tomography (PET). Further work in non-human primates suggests that this relationship is disrupted by chronic cocaine administration. This exploratory study examined the relationship between social status and D2/3R availability in healthy (HH) and cocaine dependent (CD) humans using the D-3-preferring, agonist radioligand, [C-11](+)PHNO. Methods: Sixteen HH and sixteen CD individuals completed the Barratt Simplified Measure of Social Status (BSMSS) and underwent [C-11](+)PHNO scanning to measure regional brain D2/3R binding potentials (BPND). Correlations between BPND and BSMSS scores were then assessed within each group. Results: Within HH and CD groups, inverse associations between BSMSS score and BPND were observed in the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA) and the ventral striatum, and for the CD group alone, the amygdala. After adjusting for body mass index and age, negative correlations remained significant in the SN/VTA for HH and in the amygdala for CD subjects. Conclusion: These preliminary data utilizing a dopamine agonist tracer demonstrate, for the first time, an inverse association between social status and D2/3R availability in the D3R rich extrastriatal regions of HH and CD humans.

Semisynthetic Analogues of Toxiferine I and Their Pharmacological Properties at α7 nAChRs, Muscle-Type nAChRs, and the Allosteric Binding Site of Muscarinic M<sub>2</sub> Receptors	JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS			English	Article							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; CARACURINE-V; MODULATORS; LIGANDS; RADIOLIGAND; ACTIVATION; ALKALOIDS; DESIGN	A new series of analogues of the calabash curare alkaloid toxiferine I was prepared and pharmacologically evaluated at alpha 7 and muscle-type nAChRs and the allosteric site of muscarinic M2 receptors. The new ligands differ from toxiferine I by the absence of one (2a-c) or two (3a-c) hydroxy groups, saturation of the exocyclic double bonds, and various N-substituents (methyl, allyl, 4-nitrobenzyl). At the muscle-type nAChRs, most ligands showed similar binding to the muscle relaxant alcuronium, indicating neuromuscular blocking activity, with the nonhydroxylated analogues 3b (K-i = 75 nM) and 3c (K-i = 82 nM) displaying the highest affinity. At alpha 7 nAChRs, all ligands showed a moderate to low antagonistic effect, suggesting that the alcoholic functions are not necessary for antagonistic action. Compound 3c exerted the highest preference for the muscle-type nAChRs (K-i = 82 nM) over alpha 7 (IC50 = 21 mu M). As for the allosteric site of M-2 receptors, binding was found to be dependent on N-substitution rather than on the nature of the side chains. The most potent ligands were the N-allyl analogues 2b and 3b (EC0.5,diss = 12 and 36 nM) and the N-nitrobenzyl derivatives 2c and 3c (EC0.5,diss = 32 and 49 nM). The present findings should help delineate the structural requirements for activity at different types of AChRs and for the design of novel selective ligands.

Measuring α4β2*nicotinic acetylcholine receptor density <i>in vivo</i> with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]nifene PET in the nonhuman primate	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						B-max; K-D; multiple injection; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; [(18F)]nifene; PET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; B-MAX; BINDING; BRAIN; MODEL; QUANTIFICATION; F-18-NIFENE; PARAMETERS	[F-18]Nifene is an agonist PET radioligand developed to image alpha 4 beta 2* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This work aims to quantify the receptor density (B-max) of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs and the in vivo (apparent) dissociation constant (K-Dapp) of [F-18]nifene. Multiple-injection [F-18]nifene experiments with varying cold nifene masses were conducted on four rhesus monkeys with a microPET P4 scanner. Compartment modeling techniques were used to estimate regional B-max values and a global value of K-Dapp. The fast kinetic properties of [F-18]nifene also permitted alternative estimates of B-max and K-Dapp at transient equilibrium with the same experimental data using Scatchard-like methodologies. Averaged across subjects, the compartment modeling analysis yielded B-max values of 4.8 +/- 1.4, 4.3 +/- 1.0, 1.2 +/- 0.4, and 1.2 +/- 0.3 pmol/mL in the regions of antereoventral thalamus, lateral geniculate, frontal cortex, and subiculum, respectively. The K-Dapp of nifene was 2.4 +/- 0.3 pmol/nnL. The Scatchard analysis based on graphical evaluation of the data after transient equilibrium yielded B-max estimations comparable to the modeling results with a positive bias of 28%. These findings show the utility of [F-18]nifene for measuring alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR B-max in vivo in the rhesus monkey with a single PET experiment.

However understanding of the complete mechanism of GPCR function remains limited. This study characterised C-terminally truncated versions of the human adenosine A(2A) receptor (A(2A)R) with a view to producing protein suitable for structural studies. The constructs terminated at residue A316, removing the intracellular C-terminal tail, or V334, producing a C-terminal tail equivalent in length to that of rhodopsin. Higher levels of functional receptor before and after solubilisation were obtained for both C-terminally truncated constructs compared to the wild-type receptor (WT) as assessed by radioligand binding analysis using [H-3]ZM241385. The construct which yielded the highest level of functional receptor, V334 A(2A)R, was purified in DDM to high homogeneity with a final yield of 2 mg/L. Binding analysis revealed that the purified receptor had a specific activity of 20.2 +/- 1.2 nmol/mg, close to the theoretical maximum. Pure V334 A(2A)R was resistant to degradation over 15 days when stored at 4 degrees C or 20 degrees C and showed remarkable functional stability when stored at 4 degrees C, retaining 84% of initial functionality after 30 days. This construct is an excellent candidate for structural studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Use of Acetylcholine Mustard to Study Allosteric Interactions at the M<sub>2</sub> Muscarinic Receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							GUINEA-PIG ILEUM; AZIRIDINIUM ION; BINDING; GALLAMINE; LIGANDS; SITE; DERIVATIVES; MECHANISMS; CONVERSION; MCN-A-343	We explored the interaction of a nitrogen mustard derivative of acetylcholine with the human M 2 muscarinic receptor expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using the muscarinic radioligand, [H-3] N-methylscopolamine (NMS). Acetylcholine mustard caused a concentration-dependent, first-order loss of [H-3] NMS binding at 37 C, with the half-maximal rate constant occurring at 24 mu M and a maximal rate constant of 0.16 min(-1). We examined the effects of various ligands on the rate of alkylation of M 2 receptors by acetylcholine mustard. N-methylscopolamine and 4-(trimethylamino)-2-butynyl-(3-chlorophenyl) carbamate (McN-A-343) competitively slowed the rate of alkylation, whereas the inhibition by gallamine reached a plateau at high concentrations, indicating allosteric inhibition. In contrast, 17-beta-hydroxy-17-alpha-ethynyl-5-alpha-androstano[3,2-beta] pyrimido[1,2-alpha] benzimidazole (WIN 51708) had no effect. We also measured the inhibition of [H-3] NMS binding by acetylcholine mustard at 0 C, conditions under which there is little or no detectable covalent binding. In these experiments, the dissociation constant of the aziridinium ion of acetylcholine mustard was estimated to be 12.3 mu M. In contrast, the parent mustard and alcoholic hydrolysis product of acetylcholine mustard were without effect. Our results show that measurement of the effects of ligands on the rate of inactivation of the orthosteric site by a small site-directed electrophile is a powerful method for discriminating competitive inhibition from allosterism.

J	Jiang, HB; Jiang, Q; Liu, WH; Feng, J				Jiang, HB; Jiang, Q; Liu, WH; Feng, J			Parkin suppresses the expression of monoamine oxidases	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							OXIDATIVE DAMAGE; HUMAN-BRAIN; PROTEIN; DOPAMINE; DISEASE; UBIQUITIN; MUTATIONS; MICROTUBULES; MITOCHONDRIA; SOLUBILITY	Mutations of parkin are linked to early onset Parkinson disease. Here we show that stable transfection of parkin in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y markedly reduced the activities of both monoamine oxidase (MAO) A and B. The amount of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, which is produced during dopamine oxidation by MAO, was greatly reduced by parkin overexpression. Radioligand binding assays showed that MAO binding sites were decreased accordingly. Consistent with these, MAO-B protein level was much lower, whereas the amount of MAO-A protein was not determined due to the lack of a suitable antibody. Co-transfection of either MAO with parkin in HEK293 cells did not significantly alter ubiquitination and degradation of each MAO. When we measured MAO expression by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, marked reductions were seen in SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing parkin compared with the parental cells or a control line stably transfected with luciferase. In addition, parkin mutants defective in E3 ligase activity exhibited different effects on MAO expression. We found that parkin also significantly decreased mRNA levels of both MAOs in the mouse fibroblast cell line NIH3T3. Furthermore, MAO expression was significantly increased in human B lymphocyte cell lines derived from Parkinson disease patients with homozygous but not heterozygous deletion of exon 4 of parkin. Together these results suggest that parkin suppresses MAO expression. This function may limit the production of reactive oxygen species generated by MAO in dopamine oxidation and would, thus, be beneficial to the survival of dopaminergic neurons.

In this report, we show that human melanocytes also express all of the mRNA and enzymes for autocrine synthesis of norepinephrine but fail to produce epinephrine. So far, it was established that human melanocytes express alpha(1)-AR which are induced by norepinephrine yielding the inosine triphosphate diacylglycerol signal. The presence of catecholamine synthesis and the beta(2)-AR signal escaped definition at that time. Using RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and radioligand binding with the beta(2)-AR antagonist (-)-[H-3]CGP 12177, we show here that human melanocytes express functional beta(2)-AR (4230 receptors per cell) with a B-max at 129.3 and a K-D of 3.19 nM but lack beta(1)-AR expression. beta(2)-AR stimulation with epinephrine 10(-6) M and salbutamol 10(-6)-10(-5) M yielded a strong cyclic adenosine monophospate (cAMP) response in association with upregulated melanin production. Taken together these results indicate that the biosynthesis and release of epinephrine (10(-6) M) by surrounding keratinocytes can provide the cAMP response leading to melanogenesis in melanocytes via the beta(2)-AR signal. Moreover, the discovery of this catecholaminergic cAMP response in melanocytes adds a new source for this important second messenger in melanogenesis.

Four receptor subtypes have been identified and cloned: A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3), although only A(1) and A(2A) receptors are prominent in rat brain. Much evidence now indicates that A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R) are highly enriched within striatal medium-sized spiny GABAergic neurons where they are closely associated with, and modulate, D-2-dopaminergic receptors involved in motor control and reward behaviors. There is also consensus that A(2A)R are present in the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle where they have been postulated to interact with prostaglandins in the regulation of sleep. There is less agreement as to whether or not A(2A)R are present in other brain regions. The present study describes an autoradiographic procedure that utilizes [H-3]ZM-241385 (4-(2-[7-amino-2-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[2,3-alpha][1,3,5]triazin-5-ylamino]ethyl)phenol), a highly selective A(2A)-receptor ligand. Saturable specific binding was found in the rat caudate putamen with a K-d=1.1 nM and B-max=1150 fmol/mg. Binding was also found in the nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, but was not detected in extra-striatal brain regions.

Isolated rat hearts were perfused at low Ca2+ concentration (0.8 mM instead of 1.5 mM), at low preload (5 cm instead of 20 cm), in the presence of 100 nM nifedipine or with a cardioplegic solution. After 60 min, hypocalcemic perfusion produced significant reduction in [H-3]-PN 200-110 and [H-3]-ryanodine binding, due to approximate to30% reduction in Bmax (P<0.01), with unchanged Kd. Such modifications were reversible. Similar results were obtained in the nifedipine and cardioplegia groups. Low preload perfusion produced similar contractile effects as hypocalcemic perfusion, but it had no effect on radioligand binding. After hypocalcemic perfusion, DHPR and RyR gene expression, evaluated by RT-PCR, were not modified. Chelerythrine (protein kinase C inhibitor) and lavendustin C (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II inhibitor), but not H-89 (protein kinase A inhibitor), abolished the effects of hypocalcemic perfusion on [H-3]-PN 200-110 and [H-3]-ryanodine binding. We conclude that reduced Ca2+ entry and/or intracellular Ca2+ cycling determines DHPR and RyR remodeling through posttranslational protein modifications. Both protein kinase C and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II appear to play a role in this phenomenon.

SM-31900 inhibited the binding of [H-3]glycine and [H-3]5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, radioligands for the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor glycine-binding site, to rat brain membranes in a competitive manner, with K-i values of 11+/-2 and 1.0+/-0.1 nM, respectively, and completely prevented the binding of [H-3]dizocilpine (MK-801), a radioligand for the NMDA receptor channel site. In cultures of rat cortical neurons, SM-31900 markedly prevented the neuronal cell death induced by transient exposure to glutamate, in a concentration-dependent manner. Its neuroprotective potency was much stronger than those of other glycine-binding site antagonists (4-trans-2-carboxy-5,7-dichloro-4-phenylaminocarbonylamino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (L-689,560), 5,7-dichlorokynurenic acid, and 7-chlorokynurenic acid). Furthermore, SM-31900 showed anticonvulsant activity when administered systemically, unlike other antagonists. These data indicate that SM-31900 is a systemically active antagonist with high affinity for the NMDA receptor glycine-binding site. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

In rats, chronic HAL-induced or D-1 receptor-stimulated VCMs are suppressed by D-1 antagonists, suggesting that this behavioral supersensitivity is mediated by D-1 receptors. The goal of this study was to investigate in vivo the possible relationship between D-1 receptor binding and D-1-mediated behavioral supersensitivity, after sub-chronic HAL treatments. D-1 agonist R-SKF 82957 and antagonist SCH 23390, both labeled with carbon-11, were used to assess in vivo D-1 receptor binding. Rats were treated with HAL (1.5 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle for 21 days, followed by a 4 day washout period. No significant difference was found in the regional brain binding of either radioligand. D-1 receptor-mediated behaviors including VCMs, grooming, and rearing were measured in control or HAL-treated rats. VCMs were significantly increased in HAL-treated rats, suggesting D-1 receptor stimulation and possibly receptor supersensitivity. This study failed to link the purported D-1 receptor-mediated behaviors with in vivo receptor binding measures of R-[C-11]SKF 82957 or [C-11]SCH 23390 in rat brain regions.

The regions of interest method for measuring differences in [C-11]CFT uptake level and voxel-based statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) showed that [C-11]CFT uptake in the striatum (specifically the putamen) was decreased by gait to a greater extent in normal subjects, whereas a significant reduction in [C-11]CFT uptake was not found in the putamen but in the caudate and orbitofrontal cortex in Parkinson's disease patients. These results are the first in vivo evidence that DAT availability is reduced in the nigrostriatal projection area by basic human behaviour, i.e. gait. Alterations in this availability in Parkinson's disease suggested that shifted activation in the medial striatum and the mesocortical dopaminergic system might reflect the pathophysiology of parkinsonian gait.

[F-18]F-Florastamin PET images were interpreted visually and quantitatively at both time points and compared with CIM.Results[F-18]F-Florastamin PET was superior to CT in the detection of active osseous metastases and small-sized metastatic lymph nodes that do not fall under the anatomic imaging size criteria for metastasis. Multi-timepoint imaging showed a significant reduction in the blood pool, bone marrow and muscular uptake, and increase in liver uptake over time. There is a significant improvement in tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) at the 2-h imaging time-point (P = 0.04). The mean percentage change in TBR at 2-h was 21% (SD = 0.31).Conclusions[F-18]F-Florastamin is a promising new radioligand for PSMA-targeted PET with suitable lesion detectability and high TBR at both time points.

Ketamine preservative benzethonium chloride potentiates hippocampal synaptic transmission and binds neurotransmitter receptors and transporters	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Benzethonium; Ketamine; Excipient; Hippocampus; Electrophysiology; Synaptic transmission	INHIBITION; MODULATION; ACTIVATION; AGONISTS; BROMIDE; VACCINE	Benzethonium chloride (BZT) is an excipient used in numerous products including (R,S)-ketamine (ketamine) drug formulations for human and veterinary use. Emerging evidence indicates BZT is pharmacologically active. BZT may therefore contribute to some of the clinical or preclinical effects observed with ketamine. In the present study, we evaluated: (i) the affinity of BZT for neurotransmitter receptors and transporters, (ii) the effects of BZT on hippocampal synaptic transmission in vitro, and (iii) plasma and brain concentrations of BZT following its intraperitoneal administration to male CD1 mice. Radioligand binding assays determined the affinity of BZT for neurotransmitter targets. Effects of BZT on field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were established via electrophysiological recordings from slices collected from male C57BL/6J mice. The binding assays revealed that BZT binds to numerous receptors (e.g., Sigma 2 Ki = 7 nM) and transporters (e.g., dopamine transporter Ki = 545 nM). Bath application of BZT potentiated hippocampal fEPSPs in mouse hippocampal slices with an EC50 of 2.03 nM. Following intraperitoneal administration, BZT was detected in the plasma, but not in the brain of mice. These data highlight that studies measuring peripheral endpoints or directly exposing systems, in vitro, intra-cerebroventricularly, or intracortically, to BZT-containing formulations should account for the direct effects of BZT. Our findings also suggest that earlier data attributing pharmacological effects to ketamine may be confounded by BZT and that additional investigation into the functional impact of BZT is warranted.This article is part of the Special Issue on 'Ketamine and its Metabolites'.

The chemical structures of the new compounds were confirmed by H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy and ESI-HRMS spectrometry. The affinities of all compounds for the 5-HT1A receptor and serotonin transporter protein (SERT) were determined by in vitro radioligand binding assays. The test compounds demonstrated very high binding affinities for the 5-HT1A receptor of all derivatives in the series (6a-i and 7a-i) and generally low binding affinities for the SERT protein, with the exception of compounds 6a and 7g. Extended affinity tests for the receptors D-2, 5-HT2A, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 were conducted with regard to selected compounds (6a, 7g, 6d and 7i). All four compounds demonstrated very high affinities for the D-2 and 5-HT2A receptors. Compounds 6a and 7g also had high affinities for 5-HT7, while 6d and 7i held moderate affinities for this receptor. Compounds 6a and 7g were also tested in vivo to identify their functional activity profiles with regard to the 5-HT1A receptor, with 6a demonstrating the activity profile of a presynaptic agonist. Metabolic stability tests were also conducted for 6a and 6d.

We examined the availability of 5-HT6 and 5-HT2A receptors following treatment with olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole and quetiapine in male patients with SCZ vs unmedicated age-matched healthy male controls (HC) using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [C-11]GSK215083. [C-11]GSK215083 has been shown to have selectivity for 5-HT6 in the striatum and 5-HT2A in the cortex. Patients with SCZ (n= 9) were scanned with [C-11]GSK215083 on HR+ PET scanner at presumed steady-state trough and peak serum levels following 7 days of confirmed inpatient antipsychotic treatment. Time-activity curves in regions-of-interest were fitted with multilinear analysis-1 (MA1). Regional nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) values were calculated using cerebellum as the reference region and corrected for partial volume effects. Compared to HCs (n= 9), olanzapine was associated with significantly lower BPND (range: 53%-95%) in ventral striatum, putamen, caudate and frontal cortex at both trough and peak scans. Risperidone was associated with significantly lower BPND in frontal cortex at both trough and peak scans. The study provides preliminary evidence that treatment with different second-generation antipsychotics results in differing profiles of 5-HT2A and 5-HT6 availability.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Muscarinic receptors in the homogenates of human bladder mucosa, detrusor muscle, and parotid gland were measured by a radioligand binding assay using [N-methyl-H-3] scopolamine methyl chloride. RESULTS Fesoterodine, 5-HMT, and tolterodine competed with [N-methyl-H-3] scopolamine methyl chloride for binding sites in the bladder mucosa, detrusor muscle, and parotid gland in a concentration-dependent manner. The affinity for muscarinic receptors of these agents was significantly greater in the bladder than in the parotid gland, suggesting pharmacologic selectivity for the bladder over the parotid gland. The bladder selectivity was larger for fesoterodine and 5-HMT than for tolterodine. Fesoterodine, 5-HMT, and tolterodine resulted in significantly increased (two-to five-fold) values of the apparent dissociation constant for specific [N-methyl-H-3] scopolamine methyl chloride binding in the detrusor muscle and parotid gland, with little effect on the corresponding values of the maximal number of binding sites. This finding indicates that these agents bind to the human muscarinic receptors in a competitive and reversible manner. CONCLUSION Fesoterodine and 5-HMT bind to the muscarinic receptors with greater affinity in the human bladder mucosa and detrusor muscle than in the parotid gland in a competitive and reversible manner.

The prognosis for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) has not shown any improvement in the last 30 years because of inadequate prognostic stratification. Therefore, the detection of reliable molecular markers may have a significant impact on clinical practice. As promising data regarding HER1/EGFR have been published, the purpose of the present study was to elucidate the role of the other receptors of the HER family. Study Design: Retrospective. Methods. We used quantitative immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression pattern of the HER4 receptors cytokeratin (CK)-14, CK-17, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen in 67 LSCCs and assessed correlations with various prognostic parameters. Results. HER1 levels inversely correlated with those of HER24. The negative prognostic value of HER1 was confirmed, and a protective role for HER24 was found. Specifically, the overexpression of HER4 and its nuclear localization are protective and are associated with a better prognosis. Conclusions. Semiquantitative evaluation of HER24 provides predictive information that can be combined with HER1 expression data for molecular characterization of LSCC. The pattern of localization of HER4 is an easily evaluable qualitative parameter with a clear correlation with prognosis. The immunohistochemical methods described in this article are reliable, reproducible, and potentially translatable to clinical practice.

Fluphenazine, thioridazine, triflupromazine, chlorpromazine, and promazine reversibly inhibited acetylcholine (100 mu M)-induced currents with IC50 values of 3.8; 5.8; 6.1; 10.6 and 18.3 mu M, respectively. Unsubstituted phenothiazine did not have a significant effect up to a concentration of 30 mu M. Inhibition was further characterized using fluphenazine, the strongest inhibitor. The effect of fluphenazine was not dependent on the membrane potential. Fluphenazine (10 mu M) did not affect the activity of endogenous Ca2+-dependent Cl- channels, since the extent of inhibition by fluphenazine was unaltered by intracellular injection of the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA and perfusion with Ca2+-free bathing solution containing 2 mM Ba2+. Inhibition by fluphenazine, but not by chlorpromazine was reversed by increasing acetylcholine concentrations. Furthermore, specific binding of [I-125] alpha-bungarotoxin, a radioligand selective for alpha(7)-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, was inhibited by fluphenazine (10 mu M), but not by chlorpromazine in oocyte membranes. In hippocampal slices, epibatidine-evoked [H-3] norepinephrine release was also inhibited by fluphenazine (10 mu M) and chlorpromazine (10 mu M). Our results indicate that phenothiazine-class typical antipsychotics inhibit, with varying potencies, the function of arnicotinic acetylcholine receptor. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigate the analgesics activities of a series of novel cannabinoid receptor ligands with T-type calcium channel blocking activity. Results: Novel compounds were characterized in radioligand binding assays and in vitro functional assays at human and rat CB1 and CB2 receptors. The inhibitory effects of these compounds on transient expressed human T-type calcium channels were examined in tsA-201 cells using standard whole-cell voltage clamp techniques, and their analgesic effects in response to various administration routes (intrathecally, intraplantarly, intraperitoneally) assessed in the formalin model. A series of compounds were synthesized and evaluated for channel and receptor activity. Compound NMP-7 acted as non-selective CB1/CB2 agonist while NMP4 was found to be a CB1 partial agonist and CB2 inverse agonist. Furthermore, NMP-144 behaved as a selective CB2 inverse agonist. All of these three compounds completely inhibited peak Cav3.2 currents with IC50 values in the low micromolar range. All compounds mediated analgesic effects in the formalin model, but depending on the route of administration, could differentially affect phase 1 and phase 2 of the formalin response. Conclusions: Our results reveal that a set of novel cannabinioid receptor ligands potently inhibit T-type calcium channels and show analgesic effects in vivo. Our findings suggest possible novel means of mediating pain relief through mixed T-type/cannabinoid receptor ligands.

Here we compare binding of the antagonists [3H]-AZ12491187, [3H]-taranabant and [3H]-rimonabant to intact human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing recombinant human CB1 receptors (CB1r cells). Unlabelled ligands decreased the total binding of the three radioligands with closely the same order of potency: i.e. AZ12288553 similar to AZ12491187 similar to taranabant > rimonabant. Nondisplaceable (i.e. nonspecific) binding to the CB1r cells was the same as total binding to the wells containing untransfected cells and it was more pronounced for [3H]-AZ12491187 and [3H]-rimonabant than for [3H]-taranabant. [3H]-Rimonabant and (to a lesser extent) [3H]-AZ12491187 were also prone to bind nonspecifically to the walls of the wells. Compared to the other radioligands, [3H]-rimonabant displayed lower potency for the CB1 receptors in saturation binding studies and faster association and dissociation in kinetic experiments. When dissociated, the three radioligands also showed prominent rebinding to the cells in medium only. This could be relieved by the presence of excess of unlabelled ligand and of bovine serum albumin (BSA) but a combination thereof was most efficient. The long 'residence time' of AZ12491187 at the CB1 receptor (because of slow dissociation and prominent rebinding) and its pronounced incorporation into the membranes of the cells could contribute to long-lasting in vivo CB1 receptor blockade.

Higher dopamine transporter density in Parkinson's disease patients with depression	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease (PD); Depression; SPECT; Dopamine transporter	STRIATAL DOPAMINE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; GREATER AVAILABILITY; MIDBRAIN SEROTONIN; SYMPTOMS; BINDING; SCALE	Depression is a frequent non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD) with increasing rates with the progression of the disease. Molecular imaging studies have shown a reduction of dopamine transporter (DAT) density in depressed PD patients (dPD); however, DAT role in the pathophysiology of PD depression is not clear since clinical matching was inappropriate and DAT reduction could be attributed to PD severity. To further examine the role of DAT in PD depression, this study compared thoroughly matched depressed vs. non-depressed PD patients (ndPD). Twenty PD patients (n = 10 ndPD; n = 10 dPD) matched for age and disease severity were submitted to brain SPECT imaging with [Tc-99m]-TRODAT-1, a DAT radioligand. DAT-binding potential was calculated using regions of interest bilaterally drawn in the striatum, caudate, and putamen. Depression was defined according to Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; cut-off > 18). Mean BDI scores were higher in dPD (25.0 +/- 5.6) than in ndPD patients (8.0 +/- 1.9, p < 0.0001). DAT density was greater on dPD especially in the left caudate (dPD 0.87 +/- 0.19 vs. ndDP 0.69 +/- 0.18, p = 0.02) and right putamen (dPD 0.37 +/- 0.07 vs. ndPD 0.28 +/- 0.13, p = 0.03) than in ndPD patients. Our results suggest that in vivo DAT density is increased in dPD patients as compared to ndPD, suggesting that DAT is implicated in the pathophysiology of PD depression.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of citalopram hydrobromide (a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) on the 5-HT2A receptor and brain perfusion in impulsive-aggressive dogs by means of single-photon emission computed tomography. Methods: The binding index of the radioligand I-123-5-I-R91150 was measured before and after treatment with citalopram hydrobromide in nine impulsive-aggressive dogs. Regional perfusion was measured with Tc-99m-ethyl cysteinate dimer (ECD). Behaviour was assessed before treatment and again after 6 weeks of treatment. Results: A correlation was found between decreased binding and behavioural improvement in eight out of nine dogs. The 5-HT2A receptor binding index was significantly reduced after citalopram hydrobromide treatment in all cortical regions but not in the subcortical area. None of the dogs displayed alterations in perfusion on the post-treatment scans. Conclusion: This study supports previous findings regarding the involvement of the serotonergic system in impulsive aggression in dogs in general. More specifically, the effect of treatment on the 5-HT2A receptor binding index could be demonstrated and the decreased binding index correlated with behavioural improvement.

The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) represents an appropriate target to establish PET radiotracer that are adequate for brain imaging the loss of cholinergic terminals. Here we describe the synthesis and binding characteristics of novel derivatives of vesamicol, known to represent a specific antagonist of VAChT sites. Novel benzyl ether derivatives of vesamicol either 4- or 5-substituted at the cyclohexylring have been synthesized by different regioselective ring opening reactions of a same epoxide precursor. The affinity and selectivity of the novel compounds to VAChT sites were analyzed by competitive radioligand binding studies in rat brain and liver membrane preparations using tritium labeled radioligands. The 4-substituted fluorobenzylether of vesamicol 10b was shown to exhibit a high affinity to VAChT sites (K-i-value(10b) = 10.7 +/- 1.7 nM), but demonstrated also binding capacities to sigma receptors (K-i,value(10b) = 18.5 +/- 6.9 nM, [H-3]DTG; K-i-value(10)b=30.6 +/- 9.6 nM, [H-3]haloperidol). The data suggest the potential of vesamicol derivatives to design appropriate radiotracer for PET imaging of central cholinergic deficits. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we have used radioligand binding in brain tissue to investigate if the high species variation in sensitivity to xylazine could be explained in terms of receptor interactions. Species known to be more (cattle) or less (swine and rats) sensitive to xylazine were used. There was no variation in the density or the subtype pattern of the alpha (2) -adrenoceptors that could explain the species variation recorded in vivo , as a homogenous population of the alpha (2A/D) -subtype (200-300 fmol/mg protein) was found in all species. The species differences in the affinities of xylazine and detomidine were minor and similar for the two drugs. The only parameter investigated where a significant species difference was found for xylazine but not for detomidine was the slope of the inhibition binding curve when the G-protein coupling was diminished. For xylazine this slope was considerably lower than unity (i.e. 0.77 +/- 0.075) using cattle preparations compared with 0.92 +/- 0.037 (mean +/- SE) and 0.90 +/- 0.028, respectively for swine and rats, while for detomidine this parameter was close to unity in all species (cattle, swine, rat). This finding indicates that the species variation in effect for xylazine could be due to differences at the G-protein level or further down-stream in the effect cascade.

Moreover, the competition data for SR27897, 2-NAP and YM220 were consistent with the interaction of these compounds at two binding sites. In contrast, in the human gallbladder assay, a single binding site model provided a good fit of the competition curve data obtained with all the CCK receptor selective compounds. 4 The data obtained are consistent with the presence of a single CCK1 receptor binding site in the gallbladder but not in the colon. A two-site analysis of the colon data, indicated that one of the two sites was indistinguishable from that characterized in the gallbladder. The molecular basis of the apparent receptor heterogeneity in the colon remains to be established.

To determine whether overexpression of the high-affinity folate receptor (FR) on activated macrophages can be exploited to selectively target imaging agents to sites of inflammation in rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). Methods. Folic acid was conjugated to a Tc-99m chelator (the complex termed EC20), and its distribution was visualized using gamma scintigraphy in healthy rats, rats with AIA, and arthritic rats that had been depleted of macrophages. To confirm that uptake was mediated by the FR, excess folic acid competition studies were conducted, and tissue FR levels were quantitated using a radioligand binding assay. Flow cytometry was also used to investigate uptake of folate conjugates into macrophages of both arthritic and healthy rats. Results. EC20 concentrated in the arthritic extremities of diseased rats but not in the extremities of healthy rats. The intensity of images of affected tissues was greatly reduced in the presence of excess competing folic acid. The livers and spleens of arthritic animals also showed enhanced uptake of EC20 and increased levels of FR. Depletion of macrophages from arthritic animals reduced tissue FR content and concomitantly abolished uptake of EC20. In addition, macrophages isolated from livers of rats with AIA exhibited a significantly higher binding capacity for folate conjugates than did macrophages obtained from healthy rats. Conclusion. Although EC20 is currently undergoing clinical evaluation for use in the imaging of ovarian carcinomas, the present results suggest that it may also be useful for assaying the participation of activated macrophages in inflammatory processes such as rheumatoid arthritis.

Approximately half of them exhibited superior neuroprotective activity to NBP against NMDA-induced neurotoxicity in hippocampal neurons at 10 mu M, and compound 45e and 45f exerted equipotent activity to ifenprodil, an approved GluN2B-selective NMDAR antagonist. In particular, 45e, with the most potent neuroprotective activity throughout this series, displayed dramatically enhanced activity (K-i = 3.26 nM) compared to ifenprodil (K-i = 14.80 nM) in Radioligand Competitive Binding Assay, and remarkable inhibition (IC50 = 79.32 nM) against GluN1/GluN2B receptormediated current in Patch Clamp Assay. Meanwhile, 45e and its enantiomers exhibited low inhibition rate against the current mediated by other investigated receptors at the concentration of 10 mu M, indicating their favorable selectivity for GluN1/GluN2B. In the rat model of middle cerebral artery ischemia (MCAO), 45e exerted comparable therapeutic efficacy to ifenprodil at the same dosage. In addition to the attractive in vitro and in vivo potency, 45e displayed a favorable bioavailability (F = 63.37%) and an excellent brain exposure. In further repeated dose toxicity experiments, compound 45e demonstrated an acceptable safety profile. With the above merits, 45e is worthy of further functional investigation as a novel anti-stroke therapeutic agent. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, TSPO is expressed by different cell types which complicates the interpretation. Objective: The present study evaluates the cellular origin of TSPO alterations in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: The TSPO cell origin was evaluated by combining radioactive imaging approaches using the TSPO radiotracer [I-125]CLINDE and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, in a rat model of AD (TgF344-AD) and in AD subjects. Results: In the hippocampus of TgF344-AD rats, TSPO overexpression not only concerns glial cells but the increase is visible at 12 and 24 months in astrocytes and only at 24 months in microglia. In the temporal cortex of AD subjects, TSPO upregulation involved only glial cells. However, the mechanism of this upregulation appears different with an increase in the number of TSPO binding sites per cell without cell proliferation in the rat, and a microglial cell population expansion with a constant number of binding sites per cell in human AD. Conclusion: These data indicate an earlier astrocyte intervention than microglia and that TSPO in AD probably is an exclusive marker of glial activity without interference from other TSPO-expressing cells. This observation indicates that the interpretation of TSPO imaging depends on the stage of the pathology, and highlights the particular role of astrocytes.

Here, we aimed to develop a radiofluorinated MAO-B imaging probe based on the structure of a selective MAO-B inhibitor, MD-230254. We synthesized and evaluated a series of compounds in vitro and in vivo. A series of fluorinated analogs of MD-230254 were synthesized and evaluated for inhibitory potency and selectivity toward MAO-B. 5-[4-(2-[F-18]Fluorobenzyloxy)phenyl]-3-(2-cyanoethyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2(3H)-one (2-[F-18]FBPO) was synthesized from a corresponding tributylstannyl precursor and [F-18]CH3COOF. Biodistribution after intravenous injection of 2-[F-18]FBPO was evaluated in male ddY mice with or without pretreatment by inhibitors. Among the compounds synthesized and evaluated, 2-FBPO showed high inhibitory potency and selectivity toward MAO-B comparable with MD-230254. 2-[F-18]FBPO was successfully synthesized by an electrophilic reaction with a high radiochemical purity of more than 99%. 2-[F-18]FBPO was efficiently taken up by the brain and showed rapid blood clearance, which provided a brain/blood radioactivity ratio of 3.7 at 90 minutes postinjection. The brain radioactivity was significantly decreased by pretreatment with an MAO-B selective inhibitor. The great potential of 2-[F-18]FBPO as an MAO-B imaging probe, applicable to a variety of diseases, is indicated.

JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							SQUALENOYLATED DRUGS; LIPOPROTEINS	Adenosine receptors (ARs) represent key drug targets in many human pathologies, including cardiovascular, neurologic, and inflammatory diseases. To overcome the very rapid nnetabolization of adenosine, metabolically stable AR agonists and antagonists were developed. However, few of these molecules have reached the market due to efficacy and safety issues. Conjugation of adenosine to squalene to form squalene-adenosine (SQAd) nanoparticles (NPs) dramatically improved the pharmacological efficacy of adenosine, especially for neuroprotection in stroke and spinal cord injury. However, the mechanism by which SQAd NPs displayed therapeutic activity remained totally unknown. In the present study, two hypotheses were discussed: 1) SQAd bioconjugates, which constitute the NP building blocks, act directly as AR ligands; or 2) adenosine, once released from intracellularly processed SQAd NPs, interacts with these receptors. The first hypothesis was rejected, using radioligand displacement assays, as no binding to human ARs was detected, up to 100 mu M SQAd, in the presence of plasma. Hence, the second hypothesis was examined. SQAd NPs uptake by HepG2 cells, which was followed using radioactive and fluorescence tagging, was found to be independent of equilibrative nucleoside transporters but rather mediated by low-density lipoprotein receptors. Interestingly, it was observed that after cell internalization, SQAd NPs operated as an intracellular reservoir of adenosine, followed by a sustained release of the nucleoside in the extracellular medium. This resulted in a final paracrine-like activation of the AR pathway, evidenced by fluctuations of the second messenger cAMP. This deeper understanding of the SQAd NPs mechanism of action provides a strong rational for extending the pharmaceutical use of this nanoformulation.

In anesthetized male nonhuman primates (n = 3), we used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the radioligand [C-11] AZ10419369 administered as a bolus followed by constant infusion to measure changes in 5-HT1BR occupancy. Simultaneously, we measured changes in cerebral blood volume (CBV) as a proxy of drug effects on neuronal activity. The 5-HT1BR partial agonist AZ10419369 elicited a dose-dependent biphasic hemodynamic response that was related to the 5-HT(1B)Roccupancy. The magnitude of the response was spatially overlapping with high cerebral 5-HT1BR densities. High doses of AZ10419369 exerted an extracranial tissue vasoconstriction that was comparable to the less blood-brain barrier-permeable 5-HT1BR agonist sumatriptan. By contrast, injection of the antagonist GR127935 did not elicit significant hemodynamic responses, even at a 5-HT1BR cerebral occupancy similar to the one obtained with a high dose of AZ10419369. Given the knowledge we have of the 5-HT1BR and its function and distribution in the brain, the hemodynamic response informs us about the functionality of the given drug: changes in CBV are only produced when the receptor is stimulated by the partial agonist AZ10419369 and not by the antagonist GR127935, consistent with low basal occupancy by endogenous serotonin.

Novel selective β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor antagonists for concomitant cardiovascular and respiratory disease	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						beta-blocker; selectivity; heart disease; asthma	BETA-BLOCKERS; BRONCHODILATOR REVERSIBILITY; FATAL BRONCHOSPASM; HEART-FAILURE; ASTHMA; BISOPROLOL; COPD; METAANALYSIS; BINDING; PHARMACOKINETICS	beta-Blockers reduce mortality and improve symptoms in people with heart disease; however, current clinically available beta-blockers have poor selectivity for the cardiac I31-adrenoceptor (AR) over the lung I32-AR. Unwanted beta 2 blockade risks causing life-threatening bronchospasm and reduced efficacy of beta 2-agonist emergency rescue therapy. Thus, current life-prolonging beta-blockers are contraindicated in patients with both heart disease and asthma. Here, we describe NDD-713 and-825, novel highly beta(1)-selective neutral antagonists with good pharmaceutical properties that can potentially overcome this limitation. Radioligand binding studies and functional assays that use human receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells demonstrate that NDD-713 and-825 have nanomolar beta(1)-AR affinity >500-fold beta(1)-AR vs. beta(2)-AR selectivity and no agonism. Studies in conscious rats demonstrate that these antagonists are orally bioavailable and cause pronounced beta(1)-mediated reduction of heart rate while showing no effect on I32-mediated hindquarters vasodilatation. These compounds also have good disposition properties and show no adverse toxicologic effects. They potentially offer a truly cardioselective beta-blocker therapy for the large number of patients with heart and respiratory or peripheral vascular comorbidities. Baker, J. G., Gardiner, S.

There is a considerable line of evidence both from clinical and preclinical studies supporting the notion that antagonism or partial agonism of these receptors, particularly the alpha 4 beta 2-containing subunits, could lead to antidepressant-like effects in vivo. In this chapter, an overview of the fundamental neuropharmacology of alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs underpinning its association with depression is covered, including the original cholinergic hypothesis of depression proposed by Janowsky in the 1970s. The primary section highlights important structural classes of compounds that have been reported to mediate antidepressant-like effects through targeting of alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs with an emphasis on their potency, selectivity, pharmacokinetics, and drug-likeness. The pyridyl ether ligands represent the most promising scaffold for selective targeting of alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs and their antidepressant-like effects have been confirmed in animal behavioral studies. Recent advances in the field, including the use of imaging technologies for depression, are also discussed, highlighting the evolution of structural classes that have been developed as useful positron emission tomography (PET) ligands in imaging nicotinic receptors.

Moderate Prenatal Alcohol Exposure Enhances GluN2B Containing NMDA Receptor Binding and Ifenprodil Sensitivity in Rat Agranular Insular Cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LONG-TERM-POTENTIATION; INDUCED LEARNING-DEFICITS; ETHANOL EXPOSURE; FETAL ALCOHOL; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SPECTRUM DISORDERS; SUBUNIT EXPRESSION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS	Prenatal exposure to alcohol affects the expression and function of glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors in diverse brain regions. The present study was undertaken to fill a current gap in knowledge regarding the regional specificity of ethanol-related alterations in glutamatergic receptors in the frontal cortex. We quantified subregional expression and function of glutamatergic neurotransmitter receptors (AMPARs, NMDARs, GluN2B-containing NMDARs, mGluR1s, and mGluR5s) by radioligand binding in the agranular insular cortex (AID), lateral orbital area (LO), prelimbic cortex (PrL) and primary motor cortex (M1) of adult rats exposed to moderate levels of ethanol during prenatal development. Increased expression of GluN2B-containing NMDARs was observed in AID of ethanol-exposed rats compared to modest reductions in other regions. We subsequently performed slice electrophysiology measurements in a whole-cell patch-clamp preparation to quantify the sensitivity of evoked NMDAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in layer II/III pyramidal neurons of AID to the GluN2B negative allosteric modulator ifenprodil. Consistent with increased GluN2B expression, ifenprodil caused a greater reduction in NMDAR-mediated EPSCs from prenatal alcohol-exposed rats than saccharin-exposed control animals. No alterations in AMPAR-mediated EPSCs or the ratio of AMPARs/NMDARs were observed. Together, these data indicate that moderate prenatal alcohol exposure has a significant and lasting impact on GluN2B-containing receptors in AID, which could help to explain ethanol-related alterations in learning and behaviors that depend on this region.

In the present study, in vitro and in vivo pharmacological studies were conducted to characterize SN79, a novel compound which was evaluated for cocaine antagonist actions. Radioligand binding studies showed that SN79 had a nanomolar affinity for sigma receptors and a notable affinity for 5-HT2 receptors, and monoamine transporters. It did not inhibit major cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2C9*1, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, suggesting a low propensity for potential drug-drug interactions. Oral administration of SN79 reached peak in vivo concentrations after 1.5 h and exhibited a half-life of just over 7.5 h in male, Sprague-Dawley rats. Behavioral studies conducted in male, Swiss Webster mice, intraperitoneal or oral dosing with SN79 prior to a convulsive or locomotor stimulant dose of cocaine led to a significant attenuation of cocaine-induced convulsions and locomotor activity. However, SN79 produced sedation and motor incoordination on its own at higher doses, to which animals became tolerant with repeated administration. SN79 also significantly attenuated the development and expression of the sensitized response to repeated cocaine exposures. The ability of SN79 to significantly attenuate the acute and subchronic effects of cocaine provides a promising compound lead to the development of an effective pharmacotherapy against cocaine.

The multi-injection approach was used to study in baboons the interactions between the MAO-A binding sites and [C-11] befloxatone. The model included four compartments and seven parameters. The arterial plasma concentration, corrected for metabolites, was used as input function. The experimental protocol-three injections of labeled and/or unlabeled befloxatone-allowed the evaluation of all the model parameters from a single PET experiment. In particular, the brain regional concentrations of the MAO-A binding sites (B-max(')) and the apparent in vivo befloxatone affinity (K-d) were estimated in vivo for the first time. A high binding site density was found in almost all the brain structures (170 +/- 39 and 194 +/- 26 pmol/mL in the frontal cortex and striata, respectively, n = 5). The cerebellum presented the lowest binding site density (66 +/- 13 pmol/mL). Apparent affinity was found to be similar in all structures (KdVR = 6.4 +/- 1.5 nmol/L). This study is the first PET-based estimation of the B-max of an enzyme.

The 27-kDa Heat Shock Protein Confers Cytoprotective Effects through a β2-Adrenergic Receptor Agonist-Initiated Complex with β-Arrestin	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							NECROSIS-FACTOR-ALPHA; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; PROTEASOMAL DEGRADATION; HSP27 OLIGOMERIZATION; MEDIATED APOPTOSIS; SELF-ASSOCIATION; ACTIVATION; CELLS; PHOSPHORYLATION; INHIBITION	Heat shock proteins represent an emerging model for the coordinated, multistep regulation of apoptotic signaling events. Although certain aspects of the biochemistry associated with heat shock protein cytoprotective effects are known, little information is found describing the regulation of heat shock protein responses to harmful stimuli. During screening for noncanonical beta adrenergic receptor signaling pathways in human urothelial cells, using mass spectroscopy techniques, an agonist-dependent interaction with beta-arrestin and the 27-kDa heat shock protein was observed in vitro. Formation of this beta-arrestin/Hsp27 complex in response to the selective beta adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol, was subsequently confirmed in situ by immunofluorescent colocalization studies. Radioligand binding techniques characterized a homogeneous population of the beta 2 adrenergic receptor subtype expressed on these cells. Using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase biotin-dUTP nick end labeling, immunoblot analysis and quantitation of caspase-3 activity to detect apoptosis, preincubation of these cells with isoproterenol was found to be sufficient for protection against programmed cell death initiated by staurosporine. RNA interference strategies confirmed the necessity for Hsp27 as well as both beta-arrestin isoforms to confer this cytoprotective consequence of beta 2 adrenergic receptor activation in this cell model. As a result, these studies represent the first description of an agonist-dependent relationship between a small heat shock protein and beta-arrestin to form a previously unknown antiapoptotic "signalosome."

Specific binding to receptors is usually estimated using compartmental modeling with arterial plasma input function. The use of reference tissue input (cerebellum) enables quantification without the need of arterial blood sampling, but the accuracy of this method is highly dependent on the validity of the reference region in terms of both specific and nonspecific binding. In this paper, we report exceptionally high uptake of [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 in the gray matter of cerebellum in one healthy male subject, which was reproducible in repeated PET scanning and most likely represents specific binding to 5-HT1A receptors in cerebellar gray matter. Serotonin 1A receptors are transiently expressed in the human cerebellum during early childhood and usually level off until adolescence but may persist in some individuals. As a methodological implication, the results of this study with regard to test-retest characteristics of [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 measurements in healthy volunteers using both arterial plasma and reference tissue input functions support the use of cerebellar white matter as reference region, to avoid the potential bias originating from binding of [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635 to 5-HT1A receptors in cerebellar gray matter.

The purpose of this study was to design and synthesize a set of compounds based on the 1,5-diarylpyrazole template while focusing on the potential for discovery of CB1 receptor radioligands that might be used as probes with in vivo molecular imaging. Each synthesized ligand was evaluated for potency as an antagonist at CB1 and cannabinoid type-2 (CB2) receptors in vitro using a GTP gamma S-35-binding assay. c log P values were calculated with Pallas 3.0. The antagonist binding affinities (K-B) at CB1 receptors ranged from I I to > 16,000 nM, CB1 versus CB2 selectivities from 0.6 to 773, and c log Ps from 3.61 to 6.25. An interesting new ligand, namely N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1-(2-bromophenyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide (9j), emerged from the synthesized set with appealing properties (K-B = 11 nM; CB1 selectivity > 773; c log P = 5.85), for labeling with carbon-11 and development as a radioligand for imaging brain CB1 receptors in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET).

Previous radiation absorbed dose estimates for 2-[F-18]FA were limited to evaluation of activity in only several critical organs. Here, we performed 2-[F-18]FA radiation dosimetry studies on two healthy human volunteers to obtain data for all important body organs. Intravenous injection of 2.9 MBq/kg of 2-[F-18]FA was followed by dynamic PET imaging. Regions of interest were placed over images of each organ to generate time-activity curves, from which we computed residence times. Radiation absorbed doses were calculated from the residence times using the MIRDOSE 3.0 program (version 3.0, ORISE, Oak Ridge, TN). The urinary bladder wall receives the highest radiation absorbed dose (0.153 mGy/MBq, 0.566 rad/mCi, for a 2.4-h voiding interval), followed by the liver (0.0496 mGy/MBq, 0.184 rad/mCi) and the kidneys (0.0470 mGy/MBq, 0.174 rad/mCi). The mean effective dose equivalent is estimated to be 0.0278 mSv/MBq (0.103 rem/mCi), indicating that radiation dosimetry associated with 2-[F-18]FA is within acceptable limits.

Radioligand binding studies have shown the presence of glucocorticoid receptors in neurons of the limbic system, a structure involved in mood control and subtle regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Structures of the limbic system are also rich in dopaminergic innervation. It has been hypothesized that glucocorticoids may be important in causing and perpetuating depression. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on hyperactivity induced by dopamine agonists (amphetamine, amantadine, quinpirole and bromocriptine) in mice. Male Albino Swiss mice received DEX at a single dose (2, 4 or 8 mg/kg) or for 14 days at the doses of 0.5, 2 or 4 mg/kg/day. After a single or the last injection (in the chronic experiment) of DEX, dopamine agonists were given in the following regimen: D-amphetamine (0.4 mg/kg) and quinpirole (3 mg/kg) - 30 min, amantadine (50 mg/kg) - 60 min and bromocriptine (10 mg/kg) 180 min before the measurement of locomotor activity. The obtained results show that DEX may decrease the locomotor activity and reduce the hyperactivity induced by dopamine agonists in mice. These observations may suggest that DEX weakens the activity of dopamine agonists in the mesolimbic system.

Previous studies indicate that down-regulation of mu OR is more likely with high-efficacy opioid agonists (e.g., etorphine), whereas lower efficacy agonists (e.g., morphine) do not regulate mu OR density. It has been suggested that mu OR down-regulation may depend upon increases in Dynamin-2 (DYN-2) proteins. Therefore, the present study examined the effect of various infusion doses of etorphine on mu OR density, DYN-2 protein, and DYN-2 mRNA abundance in mouse spinal cord. Mice were implanted sc with an osmotic pump that infused etorphine (50-250 mu g/kg/day). Controls were implanted with inert placebo pellets. At the end of 7 days, mice were sacrificed, spinal cord removed and processed for radioligand binding, quantitative Western blotting, or RT-PCR assay. Results indicate that etorphine induced dose-dependent regulation of mu OR density, DYN-2 proteins, and mRNA abundance in mouse spinal cord. Higher infusion doses significantly down-regulated mu OR density, increased DYN-2 protein abundance, and decreased DYN-2 mRNA. Analysis of these results indicated a significant correlation between mu OR down-regulation and DYN-2 abundance in mouse spinal cord. Taken together, mu OR regulation may depend on changes in DYN-2 abundance induced by high-efficacy opioid agonists in mouse spinal cord. Synapse 56:123-128, 2005. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The purpose of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to search for relationships between serotonin 5-HT1A receptor density and personality traits. Method: Fifteen normal male subjects, ages 20-45 years, were examined with PET and the radioligand [C-11]WAY100635. Personality traits were assessed with the Swedish version of the Temperament and Character Inventory self-report questionnaire. Binding potential, an index for the density of available 5-HT1A receptors, was calculated for the dorsal raphe nuclei, the hippocampal formation, and the neocortex. For each region, correlation coefficients between 5-HT1A receptor binding potential and Temperament and Character Inventory personality dimensions were calculated and analyzed in two-tailed tests for significance. Results: The authors found that the binding potential correlated inversely with scores for self-transcendence, a personality trait covering religious behavior and attitudes. No correlations were found for any of the other six Temperament and Character Inventory dimensions. The self-transcendence dimension consists of three distinct subscales, and further analysis showed that the subscale for spiritual acceptance correlated significantly with binding potential but not with the other two subscales. Conclusions: This finding in normal male subjects indicated that the serotonin system may serve as a biological basis for spiritual experiences. The authors speculated that the several-fold variability in 5-HT1A receptor density may explain why people vary greatly in spiritual zeal.

However, with the exception of the pituitary hormones, individual antigens specific for the pituitary gland have not been studied. To understand the pathogenesis of lymphocytic hypophysitis and to diagnose this disease efficiently, we studied the presence of autoantibodies against three pituitary-specific proteins, GH and two novel pituitary-specific proteins, namely, pituitary gland specific factor la (PGSFla) and PGSF2. Design: Seventeen patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis, all of whom had pituitary enlargement (5 with lymphocytic adenohypophysitis and 12 with lymphocytic infundibuloneurohypophysitis, including 3 of the latter group proven by biopsy), and 14 patients with hypopituitarism without pituitary enlargement (10 with isolated ACTH deficiency and 4 with idiopathic TSH deficiency) were studied, and compared with 11 patients with non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma, 31 patients with other autoimmune diseases, and 36 healthy controls. Methods: The presence of each antibody was studied by radioligand assay using recombinant human S-35-labeled protein. Results: Three (18%) patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis having pituitary enlargement, five (36%) patients with hypopituitarism without pituitary enlargement and three (9.7%) patients with other autoimmune diseases were positive for one or more of the antibodies studied. Conclusions: Anti-human GH, anti-PGSF1a, and anti-PGSF2 antibodies were detected in patients with lymphocytic hypophysitis and other hypopituitarism, but were not detected in patients with non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma. Detection of these antibodies may be useful for the diagnosis of lymphocytic hypophysitis.

RT-PCR was performed, and five PCR products corresponding to m1-m5 mAChR mRNA subtypes were detected in these cells. Ribonuclease protection assay further confirmed the presence of protected products for m1, m2, m3, and m4 mAChR transcripts. Radioligand binding studies and the analysis of changes in intracellular signaling pathways after cell exposure to carbachol were performed to study mAChRs at the protein level. Scatchard analysis revealed one single class of [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding sites. Carbachol produced a reduction on forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP accumulation in Sertoli cells. This effect was reversed by atropine, methoctramine, and tropicamide but not by p-fluoro-hexahydro-sila-difenidol or pirenzepine. Carbachol also induced an increase on total [H-3]-inositol phosphates content, an effect antagonized by atropine, p-fluoro-hexahydro-siladifenidol, or pirenzepine but not by methoctramine. Thus, mAChR activation in Sertoli cell is linked to both adenylyl cyclase inhibition and to phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Furthermore, gel shift assays indicated that carbachol also induced a time-dependent stimulation of the activator protein-1 DNA-binding activity, suggesting that activation of mAChRs may play a role in the modulation of gene expression in Sertoli cells. Taken together, these results indicate that mAChRs are present at mRNA and protein level in rat Sertoli cells.

The rapidly expanding use of neonicotinoid insecticides of varied structures makes it increasingly important to define similarities and differences in their action, particularly for the first-generation chloropyridinyl compounds versus the second-generation chlorothiazolyl derivatives. We have shown with Musca domestica that a convenient and relevant determination of the neonicotinoid insecticide target is a binding site assay with [H-3]imidacloprid (H-3]IMI), This study uses membranes from the aphids Myzus persicae and Aphis craccivora and from heads of the flies Drosophila melanogaster and Musca domestica to characterize the [H-3]IMI binding sites relative to their number and possible species variation in structure-activity relationships, With emphasis on commercial neonicotinoids, six potent chloropyridinyl compounds are compared with the corresponding six chlorothiazolyl analogues (syntheses are given for chemicals prepared differently than previously described). The preference for chloropyridinyl versus chlorothiazolyl is not dependent on the insect species examined but instead on other structural features of the molecule, The chlorothiazolyl substituent generally confers higher potency in the clothianidin and desmethylthiamethoxam series and the chloropyridinyl moiety in the imidacloprid, thiacloprid, acetamiprid, and nitenpyram series. Two chlorothiazolyl compounds compete directly with the chloropyridinyl [H-3]IMI for the same binding sites in Myzus and Drosophila membranes. This study shows conserved neonicotinoid specificity of the [H-3]IMI binding site in each of the four insect species examined.

We added 6 mu mol EDTA diluted in 3-5 mi isotonic phosphate buffer (Na2HPO4) to a commercial (CoCl2)-Co-57 radioactive tracer solution. The incubation period was 15 min. Quality control was performed using TLC and HPLC. Six healthy Wistar rats underwent Co-57- EDTA renography for 30 min. In one rat, additional TLC and HPLC was performed on blood tone sample only) and urine samples (n = 3) obtained 30 min, 30 min, 2 h and 4 h following injection of 18.5 MBq Co-57- EDTA and Cr-51-EDTA respectively. Radioisotope quantification was done by means of a germanium detector. Co-57 was chelated to EDTA at high yield (K-stab = 10(E)36). No free or protein-bound Co-57 was found. The ratio of Cr-51-EDTA to Co-57-EDTA remained constant (P = 0.133, n = 4). Co-57-EDTA was rapidly cleared from the blood pool (heart), and prompt and high target-to-background ratios for both kidneys were obtained (mean=8.4, range=7-12). At the end of the acquisition, activity remaining in the body excluding kidney and bladder was 45+/-5.2%. No specific activity uptake was noted in any other organ or tissue. We conclude that Co-57-EDTA is a promising radioligand for simultaneous clearance and separate renal function estimation. Its preparation is straightforward and, in rats, no free or protein-bound Co-57 was found. (C) 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins).

Methods: We examined the medical records of mCRPC patients who had undergone Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT from March 2017 to February 2019 in our institute. Patients receiving equal to or more than two cycles were included and analyzed in this retroprospective study.The Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET-CT and 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ((18)FDG PET)-CT scan findings, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change, health-related quality of life (HROoL) scales (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group/Karnofsky score) and Gleason score were assessed for their implications on the outcome of therapy. The treatment response was evaluated under three categories: (a) symptomatic (b) biochemical and (c) imaging response.The PFS and OS following first PRLT were determined and the association of various variables with PSA doubling time (DT) and FDG uptake in the lesions were analyzed. Toxicity assessment was undertaken objectively by National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale v. 5.0 for haematological and nephrotoxicity, and salivary gland toxicity assessed by xerostomia inventory score. Results: A total of 40 mCRPC patients (age range: 46-84 years; median 63 years), who had undergone Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT, of at least two cycles was dentified and selected for the analysis. FDG uptake was noted in 87.5% of patients (n = 35). Out of 40 cases, 21 were responders (CR, PR and SD) and 19 were non-responders (PD) on symptomatic and biochemical scales while on molecular imaging response, 16 (43%) were responders and remaining 21 (57%) were non-responders. Lesion-wise, Ga-68-PSMA-11 avid metastatic nodal disease responded well with Lu-177 PSMA-617 PRLT, as compared to hepatic and skeletal lesions. The median OS and PFS was 12 and 7 months respectively following first PRLT. Patients with negative serum PSA-DT demonstrated superior 1 year PFS as compared to those with positive serum PSA-DT (52.5 vs 47.5%) (p = 0.029). Patients receiving greater than two cycles PRLT demonstrated a higher negative PSA-DT as compared to those receiving two cycles (p-value = 0.03). Grade 1 xerostomia was observed in two patients (5%) (mean xerostomia score of 23), haematotoxicity in seven patients [Grade I (n = 2, 5%) and Grade II (n = 5, 14%)]. Conclusion: Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT was well-tolerated and able to produce disease control with good symptomatic and biochemical responses in the context of heavily pre-treated mCRPC with progressive disease, with low toxicity profile. Evident association of high FDG uptake was observed with aggressive disease biology coupled with increasing Gleason score and poorer 12 months PFS. Negative PSA-DT following therapy demonstrated longer PFS. The results demon- strate important future role of Lu-177-PSMA-617 PRLT in the treatment of mCRPC. Advances in knowledge: The present work explored in a large teriary cancer care setting, the efficacy of (177)LuPSMA-617 PRLT, in an aggressive and unselected subset of mCRPC. The response and outcome was correlated with a number of prognostic variables, including molecular imaging findings (FDG uptake in the metastatic lesions), PSA DT and Gleason score.

DATA(5m).SA.FAPi and DOTA.SA.FAPi with their non-radioactive complexes showed high affinity and selectivity for FAP. After a successful preclinical study with [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA.SA.FAPi, the first patient studies were realized for both compounds. Here, we present a new squaramide-containing compound targeting FAP, based on the AAZTA(5) chelator 1,4-bis-(carboxylmethyl)-6-[bis-(carboxymethyl)-amino-6-pentanoic-acid]-perhydro-1,4-diazepine. For this molecule (AAZTA(5).SA.FAPi), complexation with radionuclides such as gallium-68, scandium-44, and lutetium-177 was investigated, and the in vitro properties of the complexes were characterized and compared with those of DOTA.SA.FAPi. AAZTA(5).SA.FAPi and its derivatives labelled with non-radioactive isotopes demonstrated similar excellent inhibitory potencies compared to the previously published SA.FAPi ligands, i.e., sub-nanomolar IC50 values for FAP and high selectivity indices over the serine proteases PREP and DPPs. Labeling with all three radiometals was easier and faster with AAZTA(5).SA.FAPi compared to the corresponding DOTA analogue at ambient temperature. Especially, scandium-44 labeling with the AAZTA derivative resulted in higher specific activities. Both DOTA.SA.FAPi and AAZTA(5).SA.FAPi showed sufficiently high stability in different media. Therefore, these FAP inhibitor agents could be promising for theranostic approaches targeting FAP.

Tobacco Smoking in People Is Not Associated with Altered 18-kDa Translocator Protein Levels: A PET Study	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET imaging; TSPO; tobacco smoking	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ACTIVATED MICROGLIA; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; INFLAMMATION; NEUROINFLAMMATION; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; AFFINITY; HUMANS; MARKER	The effects of tobacco smoking on the immune system of the brain are not well elucidated. Although nicotine is immunosuppressive, other constituents in tobacco smoke have inflammatory effects. PET imaging of the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) provides a biomarker for microglia, the primary immunocompetent cells of the brain. This work compared brain TSPO levels in 20 tobacco smokers (abstinent for at least 2 h) and 20 nonsmokers using a fully quantitative modeling approach for the first time, to our knowledge. Methods: C-11-PBR28 (N-((2-(methoxy-C-11)-phenyl) methyl)-N-(6-phenoxy-3-pyridinyl)acetamide) PET scans were acquired with arterial blood sampling to estimate the metabolite-corrected input function. C-11-PBR28 volumes of distribution were estimated throughout the brain with multilinear analysis. Results: Statistical analyses revealed no evidence of significant differences in regional C-11-PBR28 volumes of distribution between smokers and nonsmokers (whole-brain Cohen d 5 0.09) despite adequate power to detect medium effect sizes. Conclusion: These findings inform previous PET studies reporting lower TSPO radio-tracer concentrations in the brain (measured as SUV) for tobacco smokers than for nonsmokers by demonstrating the importance of accounting for radiotracer concentrations in plasma. These findings suggest that nonsmokers and smokers have comparable TSPO levels in the brain. Additional work with other biomarkers is needed to fully characterize the effects of tobacco smoking on the brain immune system.

Pharmacological evaluation of new constituents of "Spice": synthetic cannabinoids based on indole, indazole, benzimidazole and carbazole scaffolds	FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Pharmacological evaluation of new synthetic cannabinoids; Affinities for CB1 and CB2 receptors; beta-Arrestin assay at GPR18 and GPR55; cAMP accumulation assay; Benzimidazole and carbazole; Structure-activity relationships	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; CB2 RECEPTORS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; AMB-FUBINACA; MDMB-CHMICA; AB-PINACA; GPR55; DERIVATIVES; ANTAGONISTS; FUBIMINA	In the present study we characterized a series of synthetic cannabinoids containing various heterocyclic scaffolds that had been identified as constituents of "Spice", a preparation sold on the illicit drug market. All compounds were further investigated as potential ligands of the orphan receptors GPR18 and GPR55 that interact with some cannabinoids. The compounds were studied in radioligand binding assays to determine their affinity for human cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors expressed in CHO cells, and in cAMP accumulation assays to study their functionality. Structure-activity relationships were analyzed. The most potent CB1 receptor agonist of the present series MDMB-FUBINACA (12) (K (i) = 98.5 pM) was docked into the human CB1 receptor structure, and a plausible binding mode was identified showing high similarity with that of the co-crystallized THC derivatives. MDMB-CHMCZCA (41) displayed a unique profile acting as a full agonist at the CB1 receptor subtype, but blocking the CB2 receptor completely. Only a few weakly potent antagonists of GPR18 and GPR55 were identified, and thus all compounds showed high CB receptor selectivity, mostly interacting with both subtypes, CB1 and CB2. These results will be useful to assess the compounds' toxicological risks and to guide legislation. Further studies on 41 are warranted.

TAAR1 has also been suggested as a target for novel medications to treat psychostimulant addiction. We previously reported that binding affinities at TAAR1 can differ between structural analogs of psychostimulants, and species differences have been observed. In this study, we complement our previous findings with additional substances and the determination of functional activation potencies. In summary, we present here pharmacological in vitro profiles of 101 psychoactive substances at human, rat, and mouse TAAR1. p-Tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine, and tryptamine were included as endogenous comparator compounds. Functional cAMP measurements and radioligand displacement assays were conducted with human embryonic kidney 293 cells that expressed human, rat, or mouse TAAR1. Most amphetamines, phenethylamine, and aminoindanes exhibited potentially physiologically relevant rat and mouse TAAR1 activation (EC50 < 5 mu M) and showed full or partial (E-max < 80%) agonist properties. Cathinone derivatives, including mephedrone and methylenedioxypyrovalerone, exhibited weak (EC50 - 5-10 mu M) to negligible (EC50 > 10 mu M) binding properties at TAAR1. Pipradrols, including methylphenidate, exhibited no affinity for TAAR1. We found considerable species differences in activity at TAAR1 among the highly active ligands, with a rank order of rat > mouse > human. This characterization provides information about the pharmacological profile of psychoactive substances. The species differences emphasize the relevance of clinical studies to translationally complement rodent studies on the role of TAAR1 activity for psychoactive substances.

Understanding of the molecular basis of hormone binding and receptor activation should provide insights helpful in the development of such drugs. We previously reported that Cys residues and the perimembranous residues in the extracellular loops and amino-terminal tail of the motilin receptor are critical for peptide ligand, motilin, binding and biological activity. In the current work, we focused on the predicted extracellular domains of the human GHS receptor la, and identified functionally important residues by using sequential deletions ranging from one to twelve amino acid residues and site-directed replacement mutagenesis approach. Each construct was transiently expressed in COS cells, and characterized for ghrelin- and growth hormone releasing peptide (GHRP)-6-stimulated intracellular calcium responses and ghrelin radioligand binding. Cys residues in positions 116 and 198 in the first and second extracellular loops and the perimembranous Glu(187) residue in the second extracellular loop were critical for ghrelin and GHRP-6 biological activity. These results suggest that Cys residues in the extracellular domains in this family of Class A G protein-coupled receptor is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond, and that the perimembranous residues contribute peptide ligand binding and signaling.

Interaction of the σ<sub>2</sub> Receptor Ligand PB28 with the Human Nucleosome: Computational and Experimental Probes of Interaction with the H2A/H2B Dimer	CHEMMEDCHEM			English	Article						biological activity; cancer; homology modeling; PB28; sigma receptors	EFFICIENT GENERATION; BINDING-PROTEIN; HISTONE OCTAMER; AM1-BCC MODEL; SOLID TUMORS; FORCE-FIELD; DERIVATIVES; ACTIVATION; 1-CYCLOHEXYLPIPERAZINE; AFFINITY	Sigma-2 (sigma(2)) binding sites are an emerging target for anti-neoplastic agents due to the strong apoptotic effect exhibited by sigma(2) agonists in vitro and the overexpression of these sites in tumor cells. Nonetheless, no sigma(2) receptor protein has been identified. Affinity chromatography using the high-affinity sigma(2) ligand PB28 and human SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells was previously utilized to identify sigma(2) ligand binding proteins, specifically histones H1, H2A, H2B, and H3.3a. To rationalize this finding, homology modeling and automated docking studies were employed to probe intermolecular interactions between PB28 and human nucleosomal proteins. These studies predicted interaction of PB28 with the H2A/H2B dimer at a series of sites previously found to be implicated in chromatin compaction and nucleosomal assembly. To experimentally verify this prediction, a competitive binding assay was performed on the reconstituted H2A/H2B dimer using [H-3]PB28 as radioligand, and an IC50 value of 0.50 nm was determined for PB28 binding. In addition, [H-3]PB28 was found to accumulate with up to a fivefold excess in nuclear fractions over cytosolic fractions of SK-N-SH and MCF7 cells, indicating that PB28 is capable of entering the nucleus to interact with histone proteins. In conjunction with computational results, these data suggest that PB28 may exert its cytotoxic effect through direct interaction with nuclear material.

Lateral diffusion of lipids and proteins in the cell membrane is known to be influenced by the cytoskeleton. In this work, we explored the role of the actin cytoskeleton on the mobility of the serotonin(1A) (5-HT1A) receptor, stably expressed in CHO cells, and its implications in signaling. FRAP analysis of 5-HT1AR-EYFP shows that destabilization of the actin cytoskeleton induced by either CD or elevation of cAMP levels mediated by forskolin results in an increase in the mobile fraction of the receptor. The increase in the mobile fraction is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the signaling efficiency of the receptor. Interestingly, with increasing concentrations of CD used, the increase in the mobile fraction exhibited a correlation of similar to 0.95 with the efficiency in ligand-mediated signaling of the receptor. Radioligand binding and G-protein coupling of the receptor were found to be unaffected upon treatment with CD. Our results suggest that signaling by the serotonin(1A) receptor is correlated with receptor mobility, implying thereby that the actin cytoskeleton could play a regulatory role in receptor signaling. These results may have potential significance in the context of signaling by GPCRs in general and in the understanding of GPCR-cytoskeleton interactions with respect to receptor signaling in particular.

A ligand for nAChRs with greater lipophilicity than that of 1 would be potentially more favorable for PET imaging of nAChR due to its faster penetration through the BBB. Herein, a novel series of compounds has been developed based on the high affinity ligand for nAChRs, 2-chloro-5((1-methyl-2-(S)-pyrrolidinyl)methoxy)-3-(2-(4-pyridinyl)vinyl)pyridine, 3b. The in vitro binding affinities for the new series were found to be in the range of K-i = 9-331 pM. A molecular modeling study showed differences in the comformational profiles and the electronic properties of these compounds, which provides further insight into the structure-activity relationships at nAChR. Lipophilicities of the compounds 3b-6b have been found to be substantially higher than that of 1. As a result, compounds 3b-6b might exhibit a faster penetration through the BBB than the less lipophilic 1. The N-methyl derivatives 3b and 6b demonstrated very high affinities at nAChRs (Ki = 28 and 23 pM, respectively) and will be targets for development of (CH3)-C-11-labeled derivatives as radiotracers for PET imaging of nAChRs.

Here, we demonstrate that spontaneous, ultraviolet-B-light-induced, alpha -melanocyte-stimulating-hormone-induced, and interleukin-8-induced Candida killing by keratinocytes can be inhibited with mannan and mannosylated bovine serum albumin (Man-BSA). A polyclonal goat serum raised against the human macrophage mannose receptor stained suprabasal keratinocytes, but no staining was observed on keratinocytes with a monoclonal antibody (mAb(15)) specific for the human macrophage mannose receptor. Mannose-affinity chromatography of keratinocyte extract isolated a 200 kDa protein, and on the Western blot the goat antiserum reacted with a 200 kDa protein. In radioligand binding studies, the binding of I-125-Man-BSA to human keratinocytes was inhibited by mannan in a concentration-dependent manner. Analysis of the binding revealed a single class keratinocyte mannose receptor with a K-D of 1.4 x 10(-8) M and a B-max of 1 x 10(4) binding sites per cell. The binding of I-125-Man-BSA to keratinocytes proved to be time-dependent, acid-precipitable, and Ca2+ - and trypsin-sensitive. After trypsinization the receptors underwent a rapid recovery at 37 degreesC. These results demonstrate the presence of mannose receptor on human keratinocytes, and its active involvement in the killing of Candida albicans.

We hypothesized that it may be possible to quantify changes in PSMA-TV by considering only a limited number of representative tumor lesions. Changes in the whole-body PSMA-TV of 65 patients were comparable to the changes in PSMA-TV after including only the ten largest lesions. Moreover, changes in PSMA-TV correlated well with changes in PSA levels, as did the changes in PSMA-TV with the reduced number of lesions. We conclude that a response assessment using PSMA-TV with a reduced number of lesions is feasible and could lead to a simplified process for evaluating PSMA PET/CT. (1) Background: Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET)-derived parameters, such as the commonly used standardized uptake value (SUV) and PSMA-positive tumor volume (PSMA-TV), have been proposed for response assessment in metastatic prostate cancer (PCa) patients. However, the calculation of whole-body PSMA-TV remains a time-consuming procedure. We hypothesized that it may be possible to quantify changes in PSMA-TV by considering only a limited number of representative lesions. (2) Methods: Sixty-five patients classified into different disease stages were assessed by PSMA PET/CT for staging and restaging after therapy. Whole-body PSMA-TV and whole-body SUVmax were calculated. We then repeated this calculation only including the five or ten hottest or largest lesions. The corresponding serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were also determined. The derived delta between baseline and follow-up values provided the following parameters: Delta SUVmaxall, Delta SUVmax10, Delta SUVmax5, Delta PSMA-TVall, Delta PSMA-TV10, Delta PSMA-TV5, Delta PSA. Finally, we compared the findings from our whole-body segmentation with the results from our keyhole approach (focusing on a limited number of lesions) and correlated all values with the biochemical response (Delta PSA). (3) Results: Among patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa (mHSPC), none showed a relevant deviation for Delta SUVmax10/Delta SUVmax5 or Delta PSMA-TV10/Delta PSMA-TV5 compared to Delta SUVmaxall and Delta PSMA-TVall. For patients treated with taxanes, up to 6/21 (28.6%) showed clinically relevant deviations between Delta SUVmaxall and Delta SUVmax10 or Delta SUVmax5, but only up to 2/21 (9.5%) patients showed clinically relevant deviations between Delta PSMA-TVall and Delta PSMA-TV10 or Delta PSMA-TV5. For patients treated with radioligand therapy (RLT), up to 5/28 (17.9%) showed clinically relevant deviations between Delta SUVmaxall and Delta SUVmax10 or Delta SUVmax5, but only 1/28 (3.6%) patients showed clinically relevant deviations between Delta PSMA-TVall and Delta PSMA-TV10 or Delta PSMA-TV5. The highest correlations with Delta PSA were found for Delta PSMA-TVall (r >= 0.59, p <= 0.01), followed by Delta PSMA-TV10 (r >= 0.57, p <= 0.01) and Delta PSMA-TV5 (r >= 0.53, p <= 0.02) in all cohorts. Delta PSA only correlated with Delta SUVmaxall (r = 0.60, p = 0. 02) and with Delta SUVmax10 (r = 0.53, p = 0. 03) in the mHSPC cohort, as well as with Delta SUVmaxall (r = 0.51, p = 0.01) in the RLT cohort.

However, factors regulating AhR within the gut, which is a complex metabolomic environment, are poorly understood. This study investigates the effect of a combination of metabolites on the activation mechanism of AhR. AhR activity was evaluated using both a luciferase reporter system and mRNA levels of AhR target genes on human cell lines and human colonic explants. AhR activation was studied by radioligand-binding assay, nuclear translocation of AhR by immuofluorescence and protein co-immunoprecipitation of AhR with ARNT. Indirect activation of AhR was evaluated using several tests and inhibitors. The promoter of the target gene CYP1A1 was studied both by chromatin immunoprecipitation and by using an histone deacetylase HDAC inhibitor (iHDAC). Short-chain fatty acids, and butyrate in particular, enhance AhR activity mediated by endogenous tryptophan metabolites without binding to the receptor. This effect was confirmed in human intestinal explants and did not rely on activation of receptors targeted by SCFAs, inhibition of AhR degradation or clearance of its ligands. Butyrate acted directly on AhR target gene promoter to reshape chromatin through iHDAC activity. Our findings revealed that butyrate is not an AhR ligand but acts as iHDAC leading to an increase recruitment of AhR to the target gene promoter in the presence of tryptophan-derived AhR agonists. These data contribute to a novel understanding of the complex regulation of AhR activation by gut microbiota-derived metabolites.

The new scaffold opioid ligand, Compound A, was originally found as a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist but its binding/selectivity and activation profile at the KOR and delta-opioid receptor (DOR) remain elusive. In this study, we present an in vitro, in vivo and in silico characterization of Compound A by revealing this ligand as a KOR antagonist in vitro and in vivo. In the radioligand competitive binding assay, Compound A bound at the human KOR, albeit with moderate affinity, but with increased affinity than to the human MOR and without specific binding at the human DOR, thus displaying a preferential KOR selectivity profile. Following subcutaneous administration in mice, Compound A effectively reverse the antinociceptive effects of the prototypical KOR agonist, U50,488. In silico investigations were carried out to assess the structural determinants responsible for opioid receptor subtype selectivity of Compound A. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and dynamic pharmacophore (dynophore) generation revealed differences in the stabilization of the chlorophenyl moiety of Compound A within the opioid receptor binding pockets, rationalizing the experimentally determined binding affinity values. This new chemotype bears the potential for favorable ADMET properties and holds promise for chemical optimization toward the development of potential therapeutics.

However, tumoral receptors that mediate the antiproliferative effects of GHRH antagonists in human ECs have not been fully characterized. In this study, we investigated the expression of mRNA for GHRH and splice variants (SVs) of GHRH receptors (GHRH-R) in 39 human ECs and in 7 normal endometrial tissue samples using RT-PCR. Primers designed for the PCR amplification of mRNA for the full length GHRH-R and SVs were utilized. The PCR products were sequenced, and their specificity was confirmed. Nine ECs cancers (23%) expressed mRNA for SV1, three (7.7%) showed SV2 and eight (20.5%) revealed mRNA for SV4. The presence of SVs for GHRH-Rs could not be detected in any of the normal endometrial tissue specimens. The presence of specific, high affinity GHRH-Rs was also demonstrated in EC specimens using radioligand binding studies. Twenty-four of the investigated thirty-nine tumor samples (61.5%) and three of the seven corresponding normal endometrial tissues (42.9%) expressed mRNA for GHRH ligand. Our findings suggest the possible existence of an autocrine loop in EC based on GHRH and its tumoral SV receptors. The antiproliferative effects of GHRH antagonists on EC are likely to be exerted in part by the local SVs and GHRH system.

Herein we report the synthesis and preliminary evaluation of a C-11-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) tracer originating from a mGluR2 inhibitor, 3-(cyclopropylmethyl)-7-((4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperidin-1-yl)methyl)-8-(trifluoromethyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridine (CMTP, 1a). [C-11]CMTP ([C-11]1a) was synthesized by O-[C-11] methylation of desmethyl precursor 1b with [C-11]methyl iodide in 19.7 +/- 8.9% (n = 10) radiochemical yield (based on [C-11]CO2) with > 98% radiochemical purity and > 74 GBq/mu mol molar activity. Autoradiography study showed that [C-11]1a possessed moderate in vitro specific binding to mGluR2 in the rat brain, with a heterogeneous distribution of radioactive accumulation in the mGluR2-rich brain tissue sections, such as the cerebral cortex and striatum. PET study indicated that [C-11]1a was able to cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the brain, but had very low specific binding in the rat brain. Further optimization for the chemical structure of 1a is necessary to increase binding affinity to mGluR2 and then improve in vivo specific binding in brain.

For treatment of inoperable or progressive disease, less aggressive adjuvant options are warranted. This study assessed effectiveness and safety of peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) with lutetium-177-DOTATATE for head and neck paraganglioma with emphasis on response assessment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 7 patients with head and neck paraganglioma treated with PPRT between May 2014 and October 2016 was performed. Three patients had jugulotympanic paraganglioma, 3 patients had carotid body tumors, and 1 patient had a combination of both. Patients underwent PRRT after discussion in the local tumor board regarding progressive disease, inoperability, or lack of other adjuvant options. All patients underwent 3-5 cycles of PRRT. Treatment response was evaluated by gallium-68-DOTATATE positron emission tomography/computed tomography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Outcome measures were two-dimensional tumor diameters and total tumor volumes. RESULTS: Median patient age was 60 years (interquartile range: 14-84 years). All patients had stable disease at posttherapy assessment. Decreasing tumor volumes were found in 4 patients. Clinical symptoms improved in 2 patients. No progression or adverse events occurred during a median follow-up of 39 months (interquartile range: 35-47 months). CONCLUSIONS: Somatostatin receptor-targeted therapy using lutetium-177-DOTATATE shows promising effectiveness with a high safety profile. Patients in whom surgical morbidity outweighs oncologic benefit should be informed about PRRT as a treatment option.

This allows us to investigate effects of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions on brain 5-HT levels in living humans. Here, we study the neural responses to a visual stimulus using simultaneous PET/MRI. In a cross-over design, 11 healthy individuals were PET/MRI scanned with the 5-HT(1B)receptor radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369, which is sensitive to changes in endogenous 5-HT. During the last part of the scan, participants either viewed autobiographical images with positive valence (n= 11) or kept their eyes closed (n= 7). The visual stimuli increased cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the occipital cortex, as measured with pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling. Simultaneously, we found decreased 5-HT(1B)receptor binding in the occipital cortex (-3.6 +/- 3.6%), indicating synaptic 5-HT release. Using a linear regression model, we found that the change in 5-HT1B receptor binding was significantly negatively associated with change in CBF in the occipital cortex (p= .004). For the first time, we here demonstrate how cerebral 5-HT levels change in response to nonpharmacological stimuli in humans, as measured with PET. Our findings more directly support a link between 5-HT signaling and visual processing and/or visual attention.

Currently,I-123-MAPi is synthesized using multistep synthesis that results in modest yields and low molar activities (MA) that limits the ability to translate this technology for human studies where high doses are administered. Therefore, new methods are needed to synthesize(123)I-MAPi in high activity yields (AY) and improved MA to facilitate clinical translation and multicenter trials. Materials and methods:I-123-MAPi was prepared in a single step via(123)I-iododetannylation of the corresponding tributylstannane precursor. In vitro internalization assay, subcellular fractionation and confocal microscopy where used to evaluate the performance of(123)I-MAPi in a small cell lung cancer model. Results:I-123-MAPi was synthesized in a single step from the corresponding stannane precursor in AY of 45 +/- 2% and MA of 11.8 +/- 4.8 GBq mu mol(-1). In vitro in LX22 cells showed rapid internalization (5 min) with accumulation found predominantly in the membrane, nucleus and chromatin of the cell as determined by subcellular fractionation. Conclusions:Here, we have developed an improved radiosynthesis of(123)I-MAPi, an Auger theranostic agent. This process was achieved using a single step,I-123-iododestannylation reaction from the corresponding stannane precursor in good AY and MA.I-123-MAPi was evaluated in vitro in a small cell lung cancer model with high PARP expression, rapid internalization and high nuclear uptake shown.

Especially, MDD in geriatric patients is characterized by anhedonia, which is assumed to be associated with reduced dopamine neurotransmission in the reward system. Dopamine transporter (DAT) is considered to reflect the function of the dopamine nerve system. However, previous DAT imaging studies using single photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography (PET) have shown inconsistent results. The radioligand [F-18]FE-PE2I for PET enables more precise evaluation of DAT availability. Hence, we aimed to evaluate the DAT availability in geriatric patients with MDD using [F-18]FE-PE2I. Methods Eleven geriatric patients with severe MDD and 27 healthy controls underwent PET with [F-18]FE-PE2I, which has high affinity and selectivity for DAT. Binding potentials (BPND) in the striatum (caudate and putamen), nucleus accumbens (NAc), and substantia nigra were calculated. BPND values were compared between MDD patients and healthy controls. Results MDD patients showed significantly lower DAT BPND in the NAc (P = 0.009), and there was a trend of lower BPND in the putamen (P = 0.032) compared to controls. Conclusion We found low DAT in the NAc and putamen in geriatric patients with severe MDD, which could be related to dysregulation of the reward system.

The effects of Pb2+ on free cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) concentration and calcium-regulated events have been suggested to be major mechanisms in Pb2+ toxicity. Based on our previous findings that Pb2+ changes calcium release through ryanodine receptors (RyRs), the modulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) vesicular RyRs by Pb2+ was investigated further in the present study. The results of [H-3]ryanodine binding assays showed that in the presence of a free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](f)) of 100 mu M, Pb2+ modulated the equilibrium of [H-3]ryanodine binding to brain RyRs, with a U-type dose-response curve, where minimal binding was observed at a free Pb2+ concentration ([Pb2+](f)) of 0.39 mu M. This modulation was also observed over a time course. Scatchard analysis indicated that both an increase in K-d and a possible decrease in B-max were responsible for the decrease in binding induced by low [Pb2+] f. Moreover, the effects of Pb2+ on the function of ER RyRs in neurons might also be controlled by other RyR modulators. Whole-cell patch-clamp experiments revealed that dynamic calcium oscillations evoked by specific RyR agonists were depressed rapidly and reversibly by exposure to 10 mu M Pb2+. Our study indicates that RyRs are molecular targets of Pb2+, and this interaction disturbs Ca2+ signals and leads to neurotoxicity.

Elimination of trifluormethanesulfinate from 10 and 13 represent the key steps in the synthesis. Removal of phenolic OH moiety led to 5-fold reduced GluN2B affinity of 4d compared with 3d. Additional removal of the benzylic OH moiety (5d) resulted in further reduced GluN2B affinity but increased sigma(1) and sigma(2) affinities. Introduction of a NO2 (6d) or NH2 moiety (7d) decreased the GluN2B affinity. 3-Benzazepin-1-ol 4i with the N-phenylcyclohexyl side chain showed the highest GluN2B affinity of this series of compounds (K-i = 2.2 nM) and, moreover, high selectivity over the PCP binding site, of sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors. In docking studies 3-benzazepines (S)-4-7 adopt the same binding poses as ifenprodil and display the same crucial interactions. Unexpectedly, the high-affinity ligands (S)-4i, (S)-4j, and (S)-6i were not able to inhibit the glutamate/glycine evoked current in two-electrode voltage clamp measurements and the cytotoxic effects of glutamate/glycine on transfected cell lines.

The main inducer of oral cancer is cigarette smoke (CS). Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) was shown to play a role in carcinogenesis. We characterized TSPO binding sites in human oral cancer cell line SCC-15 and examined effect of CS on TSPO binding. We exposed SCC-15 human squamous cells to cigarette smoke. [H-3]PK 11195 binding results were assessed in cells confluent for one day. To characterize the number of population sites, a custom written Matlab program compared Pearson linear correlation coefficients between all points in the Scatchard plot. Using [3H]PK 11195 as a radio ligand, we found that TSPO binding sites are not uniform, but separated into two sub-populations, one with high affinity (respective Kd and Bmax values of 1.40 +/- 0.08 nM and 1586 +/- 48 fmol/mg protein), another with lower affinity (respective Kd and Bmax values of 61 +/- 5 nM and 26260 +/- 1050 fmol/mg protein). We demonstrate rapid decrease in TSPO binding to the high affinity site induced by exposure to CS; specifically, significant 36% decrease in binding after 30 min CS exposure (p < 0.05), and 69% decrease after 2 h CS exposure (p < 0.05). Association between TSPO and CS exposure may contribute to understanding the underlying mechanism of oral carcinogenesis.

Discovery and Characterization of AMPA Receptor Modulators Selective for TARP-γ8	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							MATCHING-TO-POSITION; RECOGNITION MEMORY; NMDA RECEPTOR; TARP GAMMA-8; GLUTAMATE; ANTAGONISTS; SEIZURE; RATS; REVEALS; MODEL	Members of the alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid (AMPA) subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate the majority of fast synaptic transmission within the mammalian brain and spinal cord, representing attractive targets for therapeutic intervention. Here, we describe novel AMPA receptor modulators that require the presence of the accessory protein CACNG8, also known as transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory protein gamma 8 (TARP-gamma 8). Using calcium flux, radioligand binding, and electrophysiological assays of wild-type and mutant forms of TARP-gamma 8, we demonstrate that these compounds possess a novel mechanism of action consistent with a partial disruption of the interaction between the TARP and the pore-forming subunit of the channel. One of the molecules, 5-[2-chloro-6-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl]-1,3-dihydrobenzimidazol-2-one (JNJ-55511118), had excellent pharmacokinetic properties and achieved high receptor occupancy following oral administration. This molecule showed strong, dose-dependent inhibition of neurotransmission within the hippocampus, and a strong anticonvulsant effect. At high levels of receptor occupancy in rodent in vivo models, JNJ-55511118 showed a strong reduction in certain bands on electroencephalogram, transient hyperlocomotion, no motor impairment on rotarod, and a mild impairment in learning and memory. JNJ-55511118 is a novel tool for reversible AMPA receptor inhibition, particularly within the hippocampus, with potential therapeutic utility as an anticonvulsant or neuroprotectant. The existence of a molecule with this mechanism of action demonstrates the possibility of pharmacological targeting of accessory proteins, increasing the potential number of druggable targets.

Suicide is an important issue in the military service, since it can influence military morale and create dangerous situations for other personnel. The serotonin transporter (SERT) has been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiology of depression and suicidal behaviours. The aims of this study were to examine whether the brain SERT availability differs between military conscripts with depression and control subjects, and whether suicidal ideation is correlated with SERT availability. Methods.We used N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[F-18]-fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[F-18]-ADAM) as a radioligand for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. All participants completed the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) prior to PET imaging. Results. The effect of major depression and BSS scores had an interaction on SERT availability. After adjusting for the BSS score, subjects with depression had lower SERT availability than control subjects (F-1,F-17 = 23.85, P < 0.001). A positive correlation between SERT availability and BSS scores was observed in the depression group (F-1,F-8 = 30.67, P = 0.001). The status of depression and intensity of suicidal ideation exert opposite effects on SERT availability. Conclusions. The extent of suicidal ideation may moderate the reduction effect in SERT binding observed in major depression in male military conscripts.

Whether it might be involved in type 1 diabetes (T1D) is unknown. Our aim was to investigate the role of Tfh cells in patients with T1D and the effect of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (rituximab) on Tfh cells from T1D patients. Patients and Methods: Fifty-four patients with T1D and 37 healthy controls were enrolled in the current study. 20 of those patients were treated with rituximab. The frequencies of circulating CD4(+)CXCR5(+)ICOS(+)T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The serum autoantibodies were detected by radioligand assay. The levels of IL-21, IL-6 and BCL-6 were assessed using ELISA and/or real-time PCR. Results: Increased frequencies of circulating Tfh cells together with enhanced expression of IL-21 were detected in patients. The correlation between the frequencies of circulating Tfh cells and the serum autoantibodies or C-peptide level was comfirmed. After rituximab therapy, follow-up analysis demonstrated that the frequencies of circulating Tfh cell and serum IA2A were decreased. The levels of IL-21, IL-6 and Bcl-6 mRNA were decreased after treatment. Furthermore, beta cell function in 10 of 20 patients was improved. Conclusions: These data indicate Tfh cells may participate in the T1D-relatede immune responses and B cells might play a role in the development of Tfh responses in the disease progression.

The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) is a ligand-gated ion channel expressed on sensory neurons responding to noxious heat, protons, and chemical stimuli such as capsaicin. TRPV1 can be inhibited via mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated reduced activity of adenylyl cyclases (ACs) and decreased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels. In contrast, opioid withdrawal following chronic activation of MOR uncovers AC superactivation and subsequent increases in cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. Here we investigated (1) whether an increase in cAMP during opioid withdrawal increases the activity of TRPV1 and (2) how opioid withdrawal modulates capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior in rats. We applied whole-cell patch clamp, microfluorimetry, cAMP assays, radioligand binding, site-directed mutagenesis, and behavioral experiments. Opioid withdrawal significantly increased cAMP levels and capsaicin-induced TRPV1 activity in both transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells and dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Inhibition of AC and PKA, as well as mutations of the PKA phosphorylation sites threonine 144 and serine 774, prevented the enhanced TRPV1 activity. Finally, capsaicin-induced nocifensive behavior was increased during opioid withdrawal in vivo. In summary, our results demonstrate an increased activity of TRPV1 in DRG neurons as a new mechanism contributing to opioid withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia.

As a label-free screening technique, MS binding assays offer the opportunity to perform kinetic, saturation and competition assays using both (S)- and (R)-fluoxetine as native markers. In kinetic experiments, an association rate constant (k(+1)) of 0.92 +/- 0.17 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1) and a dissociation rate constant (k(+1)) of 0.0032 +/- 0.0002 s(-1) for (S)-fluoxetine binding to hSERT were determined. Saturation experiments provided K(d) values of 4.4 +/- 0.4 nm and 5.2 +/- 0.9 nm for (S)- and (R)-fluoxetine, respectively; statistical analysis revealed that the two enantiomers are equipotent. In competitive experiments with (S)-fluoxetine as a marker, K(i) values were obtained for various known inhibitors with a broad range of affinities for hSERT that correlate well with literature data obtained from radioligand binding experiments with [(3)H]imipramine. Additional competitive experiments using (R)-fluoxetine as a marker led to K(i) values for SERT inhibitors that deviate only marginally from those determined using the (S)-enantiomer. No changes in the rank order of affinities occurred, indicating that there is no difference in the binding characteristics of the two enantiomers.

[C-11] DASB binding potential was not influenced by the allelic status of participants whether classified on a biallelic or triallelic basis in any of the regions studied Our PET findings, in a relatively large sample with a near optimal radiotracer, suggest that 5-HTTLPR polymorphic variation does not affect the availability of 5-HTT to h DASB binding in adult human brain. The reported Impact of 5-HTTLPR polymorphic variation on emotional processing and vulnerability to depression are more likely therefore to be expressed through effects exerted during neurodevelopment (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved	[Selvaraj, S.; Cowen, P.

There are two splice variants: D-2S and D-2L with an additional 29 amino acid sequence in the third intracellular loop. Only little comparative information is hitherto available about their pharmacological properties and none of these studies dealt with intact cell systems. This prompted us to investigate the binding properties of [3H]-raclopride, a hydrophilic benzamide, and [3H]-spiperone, a highly hydrophobic butyrophenone, to intact CHO cells expressing recombinant human D-2L-receptors. Presently, we have repeated and extended this experimental approach to the human D-2S-receptors in the same cell system. Except for a slower dissociation of [3H]-spiperone from D-2S, the binding properties of these and other antagonists were not significantly different for both isoforms (P > 0.05). The very slow dissociation of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine was surprising in light of its low affinity. Two experiments pointed out the existence of non-competitive interactions between raclopride and spiperone for D-2S as well as D-2L (A. Packeu, J. P. De Backer & G. Vauquelin, in preparation). Alongside the different physicochemical properties of these ligands, this finding fits with a model wherein the hydrophilic raclopride approaches the D-2L-receptor from the aqueous phase, while the hydrophobic spiperone approaches the receptor by lateral diffusion between the membrane lipids. These different modes of approach could imply the existence of topologically distinct ligand binding sites at D-2-receptors.

Adenosine, a potent bronchoconstricting agent, exerts its ability to modulate adenosine receptors of mast cells thereby potentiating derived mediator release, histamine being one of the first mediators to be released. The heterogeneity of sources of mast cells and the lack of highly potent ligands selective for the different adenosine receptor subtypes have been important hurdles in this area of research. in the present study we describe compound C0036E08, a novel ligand that has high affinity (pK(i) 8.46) for adenosine A(2B) receptors, being 9 times, 1412 times and 3090 times more selective for A(2B) receptors than for A(1), A(2A) and A(3) receptors, respectively. Compound C0036E08 showed antagonist activity at recombinant and native adenosine receptors, and it was able to fully block NECA-induced histamine release in freshly isolated mast cells from human bronchoalveolar fluid. C0036E08 has been shown to be a valuable tool for the identification of adenosine A(2B) receptors as the adenosine receptors responsible for the NECA-induced response in human mast cells. Considering the increasing interest of A(2B) receptors as a therapeutic target in asthma, this chemical tool might provide a base for the development of new anti-asthmatic drugs.

Because of their prevalence and the critical role they play in virtually all tissue types and organs, ion channels are also involved in a number of pathophysiological conditions. The recognized importance of ion channels in health and disease, combined with the potential to develop new drugs targeting ion channels in a broad range of diseases, has fueled the need to develop more suitable screening technologies accounting for their complex structure and function. Ion channels have been neglected as drug discovery targets because of the inability to study large number of compounds or validate large numbers of unknown or mutant ion channel genes using traditional ion channel screening technologies. Therefore, several efforts were undertaken to automate and improve the throughput of electrophysiological methods. In this chapter, we will review a number of the more standard ion channel screening technologies currently used, including: (1) radioligand binding assays, (2) fluorescent assays using membrane potential dyes, and (3) ion flux assays, and emphasize some of the advantages and shortcomings of these different approaches. We will then discuss automated patch clamp technologies that aim to automate and dramatically increase the throughput of the standard voltage clamp method, and offer a true archetype shift in ion channel drug discovery.

Using an inducible thromboxane A(2) receptor (TPR)/platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) co-expressing cell model, TPR or PAFR expression was independently up-regulated. Immunostaining and radioligand binding experiments demonstrated that this receptor up-regulation resulted in increased GPCR: G protein mass ratios. This increase in mass ratio impacted both TPR and PAFR ligand affinity. Specifically, up-regulating TPR expression not only decreased TPR ligand affinity, but also decreased the ligand affinity of PAFRs. A similar effect on ligand affinities was observed when PAFRs were up-regulated. In addition, increasing the GPCR: G protein mass ratio for TPRs led to desensitization of the calcium mobilization response to PAFR activation, and increasing PAXR mass desensitized the TPR-mediated calcium response. Finally, it was observed that an increased TPR: G protein mass ratio was associated with a shift in the TPR signaling response, and revealed an additional TPR signaling pathway through Gs. Collectively, these results describe a novel mechanism, i.e., mass-dependent GPCR signaling, by which cells can modulate their GPCR signaling pathways and signaling priorities. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.

In maternal brain, radioligand binding assays showed that chronic treatment with methylxanthines caused a significant decrease in the total number of mGluRs. This decrease was accompanied by an increase in receptor affinity. Immunodetection showed that mGluR(1a) and phospholipase C beta(1) (PLC beta(1)) were significantly decreased in response to chronic methylxanthine treatment, whereas alpha G(q/11) was not affected. A loss was also detected of PLC stimulation mediated by (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a selective Group I mGluR agonist, suggesting desensitization of the mGluR/PLC pathway. In fetal brain, a loss in total mGluRs was observed in fetuses from mothers treated with caffeine or theophylline, without variation in receptor affinity. A decrease in mGluR(1a), alpha G(q/11) and PLC beta(1) levels was also observed in response to treatment. However, changes detected in this immature tissue were not associated with variations in PLC activity. These results suggest that chronic caffeine or theophylline treatment down-regulates several mGluR/PLC transduction pathway components in both maternal and fetal brain, causing a loss of receptor responsiveness only in maternal brain.

These molecules were derived with three fluorescent moieties, dansyl, naphthalimide, and NBD (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl), through alkyl chains. The synthesized molecules were evaluated in binding assays on the recently cloned human 5-HT4(e) receptor isoform stably expressed in C6 glial cells with [H-3]GR113808 as the radioligand. The affinity values depended upon the basal structure together with the alkyl chain length. The derivatives based on ML10302 were more potent ligands than the derivatives based on piperazine analogue. For ML10302-based ligands, dansyl and NBD derivatives attached through a chain length of one carbon atom 17a and 32, respectively, led to affinities close to the affinity of ML10302. The most potent compounds 17a, 28, and 32 produced an inhibition of the 5-HT stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis in the same cellular system with nanomolar K-b values. Fluorescent properties of 17a, 28, and 32 were more particularly studied. Interactions of the fluorescent ligand 28 with the h5-HT4(e) receptor were indicated using h5-HT4(e) receptor transfected C6 glial cell membranes and entire cells. Ligand 28 was also used in fluorescence microscopy experiments in order to label h5-HT4(e) receptor transfected C6 glial cells, and subcellular localization of these receptors was more precisely determined using confocal microscopy.

There is evidence suggesting an association between cortical gyrification changes and white matter abnormalities. Adenosine A2A receptors have been shown to be upregulated in cerebral white matter and on reactive astrocytes in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases. We, therefore, sought to investigate in vivo changes in A2A receptor availability in cerebral gray and white matter of PD patients and its association with gray matter atrophy. Methods: Eighteen patients with PD without dyskinesia and seven healthy controls were enrolled for this study. Brain MRI and dynamic PET scan was acquired with [11C]TMSX radioligand which binds selectively to A2A receptors. FreeSurfer software was used to segment cerebral gray and white matter structures. The resulting masks were used to calculate region specific volumes and to derive distribution volume ratios (DVRs), after co-registration with PET images, for the quantification of specific [11C]TMSX binding. Results: We showed an increase in A2A receptor availability in frontal (P < 0.001) and parietal (P < 0.001) white matter and a decrease in occipital (P = 0.02) gray matter of PD patients as compared to healthy controls. A decrease in gray matter volume ratios was observed in frontal (P < 0.01), parietal (P < 0.001), temporal (P < 0.01) and occipital (P < 0.01) ROIs in patients with PD versus healthy controls. Conclusions: Our results suggest a role of A2A receptor-based signaling in the neurodegenerative changes seen in the cerebral gray and white matter of patients with PD.

Expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) ELF3 antisense RNA 1 (ELF3-AS1) is observed in some cancers, while its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unclear. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between ELF3-AS1 and HCC based on database, bioinformatics, and statistical analysis. Methods. In this study, Kruskal-Wallis test, Wilcoxon sign-rank test, logistic regression, Kaplan-Meier method, Cox regression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and immunoinfiltration analysis were used to assess the relationship between ELF3-AS1 expression and clinical characteristics of HCC patients, the relationship between ELF3-AS1 expression and prognosis of HCC patients, and the possible functions of ELF3-AS1 in HCC. Results. High expression of ELF3-AS1 in patients with HCC was related to T stage (P < 0.001), gender (P = 0.006), residual tumor (P = 0.008), histologic grade (P < 0.001), adjacent hepatic tissue inflammation (P = 0.011), AFP (P < 0.001), and vascular invasion (P = 0.028). High ELF3-AS1 expression was associated with poor overall survival (OS) (P = 0.001) and DSS (P = 0.047). ELF3-AS1 expression (P = 0.011) was independently correlated with OS in HCC patients. In the high ELF3-AS1 expression group, GPCR-radioligand binding, M phase, Class A/1 (rhodopsin-like receptors), cell cycle checkpoints, translation, mitotic metaphase and anaphase, signaling by robo receptors, keratinization, and rRNA processing were differentially enriched by GESA. ELF3-AS1 expression was associated with immune infiltrating cells. Conclusions. ELF3-AS1 expression was associated with poor prognosis in HCC. ELF3-AS1 expression was significantly associated with immune infiltration. ELF3-AS1 is a promising biomarker that can be used for the diagnosis and prognosis of HCC.

We evaluated the impact of rs6971-SNP on in vivo [F-18]GE-180 binding in a healthy brain and in pseudo-reference tissue in neuro-oncological and neurodegenerative diseases. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) of [F-18]GE-180-PET were assessed using a manually drawn region of interest in the frontoparietal and cerebellar hemispheres. The SUVs were compared between the LABs, MABs and HABs in control, glioma, four-repeat tauopathy (4RT) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects. Second, the SUVs were compared between the patients and controls within their rs6971-subgroups. After excluding patients with prior therapy, 24 LABs (7 control, 5 glioma, 6 4RT and 6 AD) were analyzed. Age- and sex-matched MABs (n = 38) and HABs (n = 50) were selected. The LABs had lower frontoparietal and cerebellar SUVs when compared with the MABs and HABs, but no significant difference was observed between the MABs and HABs. Within each rs6971 group, no SUV difference between the patients and controls was detected in the pseudo-reference tissues. The rs6971-SNP affects [F-18]GE-180 quantification, revealing lower binding in the LABs when compared to the MABs and HABs. The frontoparietal and cerebellar ROIs were successfully validated as pseudo-reference regions.

Characterization of Subtype Selective Cannabinoid CB<sub>2</sub> Receptor Agonists as Potential Anti-Inflammatory Agents	PHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						cannabinoid CB2 receptor; agonists; inflammation; cytokines; cell migration	TUMOR-CELLS; ACTIVATION; PAIN; ANANDAMIDE; INFLAMMATION; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; INDUCTION; CYTOKINE; DELTA(9)-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL	Activation of the CB2 receptor has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects without causing psychoactive effects. Previously, we reported that the compound ethyl 2(2-(N-(2,3-dimethylphenyl) phenylsulfonamido)acetamido)benzoate (ABK5) is a CB2 subtype selective agonist with anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects. In the present study, we tested four ABK5 derivatives, ABK5-1, ABK5-2, ABK5-5, and ABK5-6, to analyze the structure of ABK5 to obtain CB2-selective agonists with higher affinity and efficacy. Affinity, subtype selectivity, and G-protein coupling were determined by radioligand binding assays. Selected compounds were then subjected to evaluation of anti-inflammatory effects using two different cell lines, Jurkat (ABK5-1 and 5-2) and BV-2 cells (ABK5-1), which are models of T cells and microglia, respectively. ABK5-1, ABK5-2, and ABK5-6 had comparable CB2 binding affinity with ABK5 (and stimulated G-protein coupling), while only ABK5-1 and ABK5-2 maintained CB2-subtype selectivity. ABK5-5 did not bind CB2 in the detectable range. RT-PCR and ELISA analysis showed that the two compounds also inhibit IL-2 and TNF-alpha production, and they were more efficacious than ABK5 in inhibiting TNF-alpha production. CXCL-12 mediated chemotaxis was also evaluated by the transwell migration assay, and both ABK5-1 and ABK5-2 inhibited chemotaxis with a stronger effect observed in ABK5-1. In the microglia cell line BV-2, ABK5-1 inhibited IL-1 beta and IL-6 production, which suggests this compound has anti-inflammatory effects through targeting multiple immune cells, and may be a candidate for treatment of inflammation.

Psychedelic effects of psilocybin correlate with serotonin 2A receptor occupancy and plasma psilocin levels	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							LIFE-THREATENING CANCER; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; AGONIST BINDING; HUMAN BRAIN; PET; 5-HT2A; VALIDATION; DEPRESSION; DECREASES; ANXIETY	The main psychedelic component of magic mushrooms is psilocybin, which shows promise as a treatment for depression and other mental disorders. Psychedelic effects are believed to emerge through stimulation of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) by psilocybin's active metabolite, psilocin. We here report for the first time the relationship between intensity of psychedelic effects, cerebral 5-HT2AR occupancy and plasma levels of psilocin in humans. Eight healthy volunteers underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the 5-HT2AR agonist radioligand [C-11] Cimbi-36: one at baseline and one or two additional scans on the same day after a single oral intake of psilocybin (3-30 mg). 5-HT2AR occupancy was calculated as the percent change in cerebral 5-HT2AR binding relative to baseline. Subjective psychedelic intensity and plasma psilocin levels were measured during the scans. Relations between subjective intensity, 5-HT2AR occupancy, and plasma psilocin levels were modeled using non-linear regression. Psilocybin intake resulted in dose-related 5-HT2AR occupancies up to 72%; plasma psilocin levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy conformed to a single-site binding model. Subjective intensity was correlated with both 5-HT2AR occupancy and psilocin levels as well as questionnaire scores. We report for the first time that intake of psilocybin leads to significant 5-HT2AR occupancy in the human brain, and that both psilocin plasma levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy are closely associated with subjective intensity ratings, strongly supporting that stimulation of 5-HT2AR is a key determinant for the psychedelic experience. Important for clinical studies, psilocin time-concentration curves varied but psilocin levels were closely associated with psychedelic experience.

The purpose of this study was to examine acute changes in glutamate after stimulation with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) using a simultaneous positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance spectroscopy (PET/MRS) approach. Ten healthy adult males were examined in two scanning sessions, and 5g NAC was administered 1 h prior to one of the scan sessions. Simultaneous PET/MR data were acquired using an integrated 3T PET/MR scanner. Glutamate (Glu), glutamine (Gln), and glutamate + glutamine (Glx) levels were assessed from MRS data collected from the basal ganglia with PRESS and from the left prefrontal cortex with PRESS and MEGAPRESS, and mGluR5 binding (BPND) was assessed from PET data collected with [F-18]PSS232. NAC administration was associated with a significant reduction in Glx and Gln in the basal ganglia spectra, and in Glx in the frontal MEGAPRESS spectra (p < 0.05); no differences in [F-18]PSS232 BPND were observed with NAC, although a correlation between pre-/post-treatment Glx and baseline BPnd was found. The MRS-visible Glx signal is sensitive to acute fluctuations in glutamate. The change in Glx was mostly driven by a change in Gln, lending weight to the notion that Gln can provide a proxy marker for neurotransmitter/synaptic glutamate. [F-18]PSS232 binding is not sensitive to acute glutamate shifts independently, but was associated with the extent of glutamate liberation upon NAC stimulation.

In clinical usage, somatostatin peptide-based analogs, labeled with therapeutic radionuclides, provide an overall response rate of about 30%, despite the high cumulative activity injected per patient. We set out to improve the effectiveness of somatostatin radiotherapy by preparing a chemical analog that would clear more slowly through the urinary tract and, concomitantly, have increased blood circulation half-life and higher targeted accumulation in the tumors. Experimental Design: We conjugated a common, clinically-used SST peptide derivative, DOTA-octreotate, to an Evans blue analog (EB), which reversibly binds to circulating serum albumin. The resulting molecule was used to chelate Y-86 and Y-90, a diagnostic and a therapeutic radionuclide, respectively. The imaging capabilities and the radiotherapeutic efficacy of the resulting radioligand was evaluated in HCT116/SSTR2, HCT116, and AR42J cell lines that express differing levels of SST2 receptors. Results: The synthesized radiopharmaceutical retained affinity and specificity to SSTR2. The new molecule also retained the high internalization rate of DOTA-octreotate, and therefore, showed significantly higher accumulation in SSTR2-positive tumors. Labeling of our novel EB-octreotate derivative with the therapeutic, pure beta emitter, Y-90, resulted in improved tumor response and survival rates of mice bearing SSTR2 xenografts and had long term efficacy when compared to DOTA-octreotate itself. Conclusions: The coupling of a targeted peptide, a therapeutic radionuclide, and the EB-based albumin binding provides for effective treatment of SSTR2-containing tumors.

Parametric Binding Images of the TSPO Ligand <SUP>18</SUP>F-DPA-714	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						F-18-DPA-714; PET; parametric images; TSPO	REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; REVERSIBLE RADIOLIGAND BINDING; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; REFERENCE REGION; DYNAMIC PET	F-18-labeled N,N-diethyl-2-(2-[4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl]-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-alpha]pyrimidine-3-yl)acetamide (DPA-714) is a radio-ligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein. The purpose of the present study was to identify the best method for generating quantitative parametric images of F-18-DPA-714 binding. Methods: Ninety-minute dynamic F-18-DPA-714 PET scans with full arterial sampling from 6 healthy subjects and 9 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients were used. Plasma-input based Logan graphical analysis and spectral analysis were used to generate parametric volume of distribution (V-T) images. Five versions of Ichise, reference Logan, and 2 basis function implementations (receptor parametric mapping and simplified reference tissue model 2 [SRTM2]) of SRTM, all using gray matter cerebellum as the reference region, were applied to generate nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) images. Results: Plasma-input Logan analysis (r(2) = 0.99; slope, 0.88) and spectral analysis (r(2) = 0.99, slope, 0.93) generated estimates of VT that correlated well with values obtained using nonlinear regression. BPND values generated using SRTM2 (r(2) = 0.83; slope, 0.95) and reference Logan analysis (r(2) = 0.88; slope, 1.01) correlated well with nonlinear regression based estimates. Conclusion: Both Logan analysis and spectral analysis can be used to obtain quantitatively accurate VT images of F-18-DPA-714. In addition, SRTM2 and reference Logan analysis can provide accurate BPND images. These parametric images could be used for voxel-based comparisons.	[Golla, Sandeep S.

Here, we compared V0162's in vitro pharmacological activity at recombinant human M-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (hM3Rs) with that of other anticholinergics, using (i) a radioligand binding assay, (ii) a functional reporter gene assay and (iii) a bronchoconstriction inhibition assay on human bronchial preparations. V0162 had high affinity for hM3Rs, with a pK(i) varying from 9.01 after a 2 h incubation to 9.21 after 23 h. The other mequitazine enantiomer (V0114) was less potent. V0162 displayed rapid off-kinetics and a biphasic time course of binding. V0162 was found to be an antagonist behaving as an inverse agonist for hM3R-mediated reporter gene activation, with much the same efficacy as atropine, ipratropium and tiotropium. However, in contrast to ipratropium and atropine, V0162's inhibitory potency was only slightly affected by compound washout. V0162 antagonized acetylcholine-mediated contractions in a human bronchial preparation; the pA(2) values increased with the incubation time (up to 2 h). Moreover, there was a progressive increase in V0162's ability to inhibit electrically-induced contractions, which persisted after compound washout. In conclusion, V0162 is the most active mequitazine enantiomer at hM3Rs and shows a complex pattern of binding to the membrane compartment. These particular features may be of therapeutic value when persistent antagonism at hM3Rs is required. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Prevalence and Clinical Associations of Calcium-Sensing Receptor and NALP5 Autoantibodies in Finnish APECED Patients	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							CANDIDIASIS-ECTODERMAL DYSTROPHY; POLYENDOCRINE SYNDROME TYPE-1; SYNDROME TYPE-I; IDIOPATHIC HYPOPARATHYROIDISM; AUTOIMMUNE HYPOPARATHYROIDISM; ACQUIRED HYPOPARATHYROIDISM; TRYPTOPHAN-HYDROXYLASE; PARATHYROID CELLS; ANTIBODIES; GENE	Context: Previous studies have identified the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) and NALP5 as parathyroid autoantibody targets in patients with autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy (APECED). However, although NALP5 antibodies have been associated with the occurrence of hypoparathyroidism (HP) in APECED, it is unclear whether CaSR antibodies are a specific or sensitive marker for APECED-associated HP. Objective: The objective of the study was to identify associations between the presence of CaSR and NALP5 antibodies and the disease manifestations and demographic characteristics of Finnish APECED patients. Design, Subjects, and Methods: This was a case-control study including 44 APECED patients and 38 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Antibodies against the CaSR and NALP5 were detected using immunoprecipitation assays and radioligand binding assays, respectively. Results: CaSR and NALP5 antibodies were detected in 16 of 44 (36%) and 13 of 44 (30%) patients, respectively. No statistically significant associations were found between the presence of CaSR or NALP5 antibodies and the disease manifestations of APECED including HP (P > .05). For the diagnosis of HP, CaSR and NALP5 antibodies had specificities of 83% and 50%, respectively, and sensitivities of 39% and 26%, respectively. A significant association between both a shorter APECED and HP duration (<10 y) and positivity for CaSR antibodies was noted (P = .019 and P = .0061, respectively). Conclusion: Neither CaSR nor NALP5 antibodies were found to be specific or sensitive markers for HP in APECED. Further investigations are required to determine the exact role of the autoimmune response against the CaSR and NALP5 in the pathogenesis of this autoimmune syndrome.	[Kemp, E.

Parametric images were generated using (1) a two-tissue compartmental model (2TCM) solved with the hierarchical basis function method (H-BFM) linear estimator; (2) data-driven spectral-based methods: standard spectral analysis (std SA) and rank-shaping SA (RS); and (3) the Logan graphical plot. Nonphysiologic V-T estimates were eliminated and the remaining ones were compared with the reference values, i.e., those obtained with a voxelwise 2TCM solved with a nonlinear estimator. With regard to voxelwise V-T estimates, H-BFM showed the best agreement with weighted nonlinear least square (WNLLS) values and the lowest percentage of mean relative difference (1+/-1%). All methods showed comparable variability in the relative differences. H-BFM provided the best correlation with WNLLS (y=1.034x-0.013; R-2=0.973). Despite a slight bias, the other three methods also showed good agreement and high correlation (R-2>0.96). H-BFM yielded the most reliable voxelwise quantification of [C-11](R)-rolipram as well as the complete description of the tracer kinetic. The Logan plot represents a valid alternative if only V-T estimation is required. Its marginally higher bias was outweighed by a low computational time, ease of implementation, and robustness.

In vitro competition binding assays showed that 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-4-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl) piperazine (6) exhibits low nanomolar affinity for sigma(1) receptors (K-i = 1.85 +/- 1.59 nM) and high subtype selectivity (sigma(2) receptor: K-i = 291 +/- 111 nM; K-i sigma(2)/K-i sigma(1) = 157). [F-18]6 was prepared in 30-50% isolated radiochemical yield, with radiochemical purity of >99% by HPLC analysis after purification, via nucleophilic F-18 substitution of the corresponding tosylate precursor. The logD(pH 7.4) value of [F-18]6 was found to be 2.57 +/- 0.10, which is within the range expected to give high brain uptake. Biodistribution studies in mice demonstrated relatively high concentration of radiotracers in organs known to contain sigma(1) receptors, including the brain, lungs, kidneys, heart, and spleen. Administration of haloperidol 5 min prior to injection of [F-18]6 significantly reduced the concentration of radiotracers in the above-mentioned organs. The accumulation of radiotracers in the bone was quite low suggesting that [F-18]6 is relatively stable to in vivo defluorination. The ex vivo autoradiography in rat brain showed high accumulation of radiotracers in the brain areas known to possess high expression of sigma(1) receptors. These findings suggest that [F-18]6 is a suitable radiotracer for imaging sigma(1) receptors with PET in vivo. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their interaction with 5-HT and dopamine receptors and their psychostimulant effect was also studied. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Locomotor activity was recorded in mice following different doses of cathinones. Monoamine uptake assays were performed in purified rat synaptosomes. Radioligand-binding assays were carried out to assess the affinity of these compounds for monoamine transporters or receptors. KEY RESULTS Butylone, mephedrone and methylone (525 mg.kg-1) caused hyperlocomotion, which was prevented with ketanserin or haloperidol. Methylone was the most potent compound inhibiting both [3H]5-HT and [3H]dopamine uptake with IC50 values that correlate with its affinity for dopamine and 5-HT transporter. Mephedrone was found to be the cathinone derivative with highest affinity for vesicular monoamine transporter-2 causing the inhibition of dopamine uptake. The affinity of cathinones for 5-HT2A receptors was similar to that of MDMA. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Butylone and methylone induced hyperlocomotion through activating 5-HT2A receptors and increasing extra-cellular dopamine. They inhibited 5-HT and dopamine uptake by competing with substrate. Methylone was the most potent 5-HT and dopamine uptake inhibitor and its effect partly persisted after withdrawal. Mephedrone-induced hyperlocomotion was dependent on endogenous 5-HT. Vesicular content played a key role in the effect of mephedrone, especially for 5-HT uptake inhibition. The potency of mephedrone in inhibiting noradrenaline uptake suggests a sympathetic effect of this cathinone.

Its 110 minutes half-life allows long scan durations. However, the optimum scan duration is a matter of debate. This investigation focuses on scan-duration-related effects on simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) results and the time point of transient equilibrium in a large sample of dynamic FP positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Fifty drug-free and 50 AP-treated subjects underwent FP-PET scans (180 minutes scan duration). The binding potential (BPND) of the putamen, thalamus, and temporal cortex were calculated using the SRTM and the transient equilibrium model. Furthermore, receptor occupancies were calculated for AP-treated patients. Transient equilibrium in the unblocked putamen occurred after 121 +/- 29.6 minutes. The transient equilibrium occurred much earlier in the extrastriatal regions or under AP treatment. Stepwise scan shortening caused BPND under-estimations of 0.58% for the first 10-minute reduction (putamen, SRTM), finally reaching 5.76% after 1 hour scan-time reduction. We observed preferential extrastriatal AP binding irrespective of the analytical method. [F-18]fallypride scan durations of 180 minutes reliably reach equilibrium even in D-2/3-receptor-rich regions. Moderate reductions in FP scan durations only caused small changes to SRTM results even in receptor-rich regions. Apparently, the D-2/3 receptor occupancy results of APs, especially preferential extrastriatal binding observations, are not relevantly biased by inappropriate scan durations.

Efflux transporters at the BBB-P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)-could limit their uptake by the brain. Methods: We developed and validated an in vitro model using MDCKII cells transfected with human multidrug resistance (MDR1) or BCRP genes and assessed the transport of selected PET ligands by the concentration equilibrium technique. The tested compounds included befloxatone, (R,S)-CGP-12177, clorgyline, R-(-)-deprenyl, diprenorphine, DPA-714, fallypride, flumazenil, 2-fluoro-A-85380, LBT-999, loperamide, p-MPPF, PE2I, Pittsburgh compound B (PIB), (R,S)-PK11195, raclopride, R-(+)-verapamil, and WAY-100635. The assays were performed using the nonradioactive form of each compound (ultraviolet high-performance liquid chromatography analysis) and, when available, the F-18-labeled analogs (g-counting). Results: Befloxatone appeared to be transported solely by BCRP. Loperamide, verapamil, and diprenorphine were the only P-gp substrates. Other ligands were transported by neither P-gp nor BCRP. Conclusion: The present method can readily be used to screen new-compound transport by P-gp or BCRP, even before any radiolabeling. Compounds that were previously thought to be transported by P-gp in rodents, such as p-MPPF, WAY-100635, and flumazenil, cannot be considered substrates of human P-gp. The impact of BCRP and P-gp at the BBB on the transport of befloxatone and diprenorphine in vivo remains to be evaluated with PET.

Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), which are known to favor bradykinin (BK) bioactivity by reducing its metabolism, may have a positive impact on preventing the microvascular structural rarefaction that occurs in these diseases. Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that BK, via B2 receptors (B2R), protects the viability of the microvascular endothelium exposed to the necrotic and apoptotic cell death inducers H2O2 and LPS independently of hemodynamics. Expression (RT-PCR and radioligand binding) and functional (calcium mobilization with furs-2AM, and p42/p44MAPK and Akt phosphorylation assays) experiments revealed the presence of functional B2R in pig cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (pCMVEC). In vitro results showed that the cytocidal effects of H2O2 and LIPS on pCMVEC were significantly decreased by a BK pretreatment (MTT and crystal violet tests, annexin-V staining/FACS analysis), which was countered by the B2R antagonist HOE 140. BK treatment coincided with enhanced expression of the cytoprotective proteins COX-2, Bcl-2, and (SOD)-S-Cu/Zn. Ex vivo assays on rat brain explants showed that BK impeded (by similar to 40%) H2O2-induced microvascular degeneration (lectin-FITC staining). The present study proposes a novel role for BK in microvascular endothelial protection, which may be pertinent to the complex mechanism of action of ACEi explaining their long-term beneficial effects in maintaining vascular integrity.

Differential effects of acute and repeat dosing with the H<sub>3</sub> antagonist GSK189254 on the sleep-wake cycle and narcoleptic episodes in Ox-/- mice	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Orexin knockout mice; GSK189254; H-3 receptor antagonist; narcolepsy; modafinil; sleep-wake cycle	RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; BRAIN HISTAMINE; POSTERIOR HYPOTHALAMUS; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; CORTICAL ACTIVATION; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; RELEASE; NEURONS; WAKING; H-3-RECEPTOR	Histamine H-3 receptor antagonists are currently being evaluated in clinical trials for a number of central nervous system disorders including narcolepsy. These agents can increase wakefulness (W) in cats and rodents following acute administration, but their effects after repeat dosing have not been reported previously. EEG and EMG recordings were used to investigate the effects of acute and repeat administration of the novel H-3 antagonist GSK189254 on the sleep-wake cycle in wild-type (Ox+/+) and orexin knockout (Ox-/-) mice, the latter being genetically susceptible to narcoleptic episodes. In addition, we investigated H-3 and H-1 receptor expression in this model using radioligand binding and autoradiography. In Ox+/+ and Ox-/- mice, acute administration of GSK189254 (3 and 10 mg.kg(-1) p.o.) increased W and decreased slow wave and paradoxical sleep to a similar degree to modafinil (64 mg.kg(-1)), while it reduced narcoleptic episodes in Ox-/- mice. After twice daily dosing for 8 days, the effect of GSK189254 (10 mg.kg(-1)) on W in both Ox+/+ and Ox-/- mice was significantly reduced, while the effect on narcoleptic episodes in Ox-/- mice was significantly increased. Binding studies revealed no significant differences in H-3 or H-1 receptor expression between Ox+/+ and Ox-/- mice. These studies provide further evidence to support the potential use of H-3 antagonists in the treatment of narcolepsy and excessive daytime sleepiness. Moreover, the differential effects observed on W and narcoleptic episodes following repeat dosing could have important implications in clinical studies.	[Roberts, J. C.; Brown, S.

We studied the in vitro effect of capsaicin (1-10 mu M) on homologous and heterologous competitive binding of opioid ligands, using unlabeled synthetic peptides and the following tritiated compounds: [H-3]endomorphin-1, 1[H-3]endomorphin-2,[H-3]nociceptin((1-17)) and [H-3]dynorphin((1-17)). Capsaicin-dependent inhibition was also observed in [S-35]GTP gamma S stimulation assays in the presence of certain opioid peptides. The inhibition of opioid binding was further investigated using other synthetic and natural mu-opioid ligands such as [D-Ala(2),(NMe)Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), morphine and naloxone. The decrease in opioid ligand affinity upon capsaicin treatments was most apparent with endomorphin-1, followed by nociceptin and dynorphin. The binding of other investigated opioids were not affected in the presence of capsaicin. In [H-3]endomorphin-1 binding assays, capsazepine antagonized the inhibitory effect of capsaicin in rat brain membranes suggesting the involvement of TRPV1 receptors. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing mu-opioid receptors, but lacking vanilloid receptors, the inhibition by capsaicin on the binding of [H-3]endomorphin-1 was not present. It is concluded that the inhibitory effect of capsaicin on the receptor binding affinity of endogenous opioid peptides in brain membrane preparations seems not to be a direct effect, it is rather a negative feedback interaction with opioid receptors.

BYK191023(2-[2-(4-methoxy-pyridin-2-yl)-ethyl]-3<i>H</i>-imidazo[4,5-<i>b</i>]pyridine) is an NADPH- and time-dependent irreversible inhibitor of inducible nitric-oxide synthase	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							HIGHLY SELECTIVE INHIBITOR; NEURONAL NO-SYNTHASE; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; PROSTHETIC GROUP; L-ARGININE; IN-VITRO; SUBSTRATE; ENZYME; INACTIVATION; DIMERIZATION	Imidazopyridine derivates were recently shown to be a novel class of selective and arginine-competitive inhibitors of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), and 2-[2-(4-methoxypyridin-2-yl)-ethyl]-3H-imidazo[4,5-b] pyridine (BYK191023) was found to have very high selectivity in enzymatic and cellular models (Mol Pharmacol 69: 328-337, 2006). Here, we show that BYK191023 irreversibly inactivates murine iNOS in an NADPH- and time-dependent manner, whereas it acts only as a reversible L-arginine-competitive inhibitor in the absence of NADPH or during anaerobic preincubation. Time-dependent irreversible inhibition by BYK191023 could also be demonstrated in intact cells using the RAW macrophage or iNOS-overexpressing human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines. The mechanism of BYK191023 inhibition in the presence of NADPH was studied using spectral, kinetic, chromatographic, and radioligand binding methods. BYK191023-bound iNOS was spectrally indistinguishable from L-arginine-bound iNOS, pointing to an interaction of BYK191023 with the catalytic center of the enzyme. [H-3] BYK191023 was recovered quantitatively from irreversibly inactivated iNOS, and no inhibitor metabolite was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Size exclusion chromatography revealed only about 20% iNOS dissociation into monomers. Furthermore, HPLC and spectrophotometric analysis showed that the irreversible inhibition was associated with loss of heme from iNOS and a reduced ability to form the distinctive ferrous heme-CO complex (cytochrome P450). Thus, enzyme inactivation is mainly caused by heme loss, and it occurs in the inhibitor-bound enzyme in the presence of electron flux from NADPH.

Effects of cocaine and MDMA self-administration on serotonin transporter availability in monkeys	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cocaine; MDMA; self-administration; PET; serotonin transporters; nonhuman primates	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RHESUS-MONKEYS; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE MDMA; IN-VIVO; REINFORCING EFFICACY; DOPAMINE CONCENTRATIONS; MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS; TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; INTRAVENOUS COCAINE; DEPENDENT PATIENTS	Although serotonin (5-HT) can interact with dopamine (DA) systems to modulate the subjective and reinforcing effects of psychostimulants such as cocaine and 3,4-methyldioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA, ecstasy), the long-term effects of exposure to psychostimulants on brain 5-HT systems are not well characterized. The present study assessed 5-HT transporter (SERT) availability using positron emission tomography (PET) in rhesus monkeys with the SERT-specific radioligand [C-11]3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile (DASB). SERT availability was assessed in regions of interest including the caudate nucleus, putamen, anterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum. [C-11]DASB distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were calculated using the cerebellum as the reference region. DVRs were calculated in control monkeys and in cocaine or MDMA self-administering monkeys approximately 24 h after the last self-administration (SA) session. SERT availability did not differ between monkeys with a history of MDMA SA and control monkeys in any region examined. In contrast, monkeys with a history of cocaine SA showed significantly higher levels of SERT availability in the caudate nucleus and putamen compared to control subjects. These results suggest that chronic SA of cocaine, but not MDMA, leads to alterations in serotonergic function in brain areas relevant to drug abuse. The higher level of SERT availability in cocaine-experienced monkeys may lead to a reduced inhibitory tone of 5-HT on the DA system, which may explain, in part, differences in the abuse liability between cocaine and MDMA.

Cysteine pairs in the third intracellular loop of the muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> acetylcholine receptor play a role in agonist-induced internalization	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; CHOLINERGIC-RECEPTOR; CYTOPLASMIC LOOP; HIPPOCAMPAL-NEURONS; DOWN-REGULATION; PHOSPHORYLATION; CELLS; DOMAINS; M-1; PALMITOYLATION	We determined the functional role of a small domain in the third intracellular loop of the human muscarinic M-1 (hM(1)) receptor. Using site-directed mutagenesis, several mutant hM(1) receptors were made possessing either a deletion or point mutations within the third intracellular loop domain (252)PETPPGRCCRCC(263). Wild-type and mutant hM(1) receptors were transiently expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the effects of each mutation on radioligand binding, agonist-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and agonist-induced internalization were determined. The mutant receptors exhibited a modest reduction in affinity for [H-3]N-methylscopolamine (pK(D) = similar to 9.0) and a moderately increased binding capacity relative to the wild-type receptor. This moderate increase in binding capacity was associated with small increases in the maximal response and potency of carbachol for eliciting phosphoinositide hydrolysis through the mutant receptors (pEC(50) = similar to 5.5) relative to wild-type (pEC(50) = 5.35 +/- 0.05). In contrast, carbachol-induced internalization of mutant hM(1) receptors possessing either C259A/C260A or C262A/C263A or both double point mutations was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type hM(1) receptor. Of the hM(1) receptor mutants tested, those possessing a C262D/C263D double point mutation had the least carbachol-induced internalization. The desensitization and down-regulation of receptors possessing either Cys/Ala or Cys/Asp double point mutations were similar to those observed for the wild-type hM(1) receptor. Collectively, these observations suggest that Cys pairs Cys259/Cys260 and Cys262/Cys263 play an important role in the agonist-induced internalization of hM(1) receptors.

Multiple drugbinding sites on the R482G isoform of the ABCG2 transporter	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						multidrug resistance; cancer chemotherapy; breast cancer resistance protein; ABCG2; ABC transporter; drug binding; daunomycin; drug efflux	RESISTANCE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; METHOTREXATE TRANSPORT; SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY; ACQUIRED MUTATIONS; DRUG TRANSPORT; BINDING-SITES; LUNG-CANCER; RECEPTOR	Background & Purpose: Drug-resistant cancer cells frequently display efflux pumps such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP1) or the transporter ABCG2. These transporters are each capable of mediating the active efflux of numerous anticancer drugs and display relatively distinct substrate preferences. The last, most recently discovered member, ABCG2, plays a major role in resistance in several types of cancer and the precise pharmacology of this multidrug transporter remain unresolved as does the nature of substrate binding. Experimental Approach: Plasma membranes from insect cells expressing ABCG2 were used to characterise binding of [H-3] daunomycin to the multidrug transporter. The kinetics of association and dissociation for this substrate and several other compounds were also determined in this experimental system. Key Results: The dissociation constant for [H-3] daunomycin binding was 564 +/- 57 nM and a Hill slope of 1.4 suggested cooperative binding. Doxorubicin, prazosin and daunomycin completely displaced the binding of radioligand, while mitoxantrone and Hoechst 33342 produced only a partial displacement. Analysis of the dissociation rates revealed that [H-3] daunomycin and doxorubicin bind to multiple sites on the transporter. Conclusions: Both kinetic and equilibrium data support the presence of at least two symmetric drug binding sites on ABCG2, which is distinct from the asymmetry observed for P-gp. The data provide the first molecular details underlying the mechanism by which this transporter is capable of interacting with multiple substrates.

Thirteen healthy male volunteers were investigated with multimodal imaging, using the radioligand 6-[F-18] fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) for positron emission tomography ( PET) measurements of dopamine synthesis capacity, and also functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI) in a cognitive activation paradigm. We calculated the correlation between FDOPA net blood-brain influx (K-in(app); ml/g/min) in the ventral and associative dorsal striatum and BOLD signal changes elicited by standardized affectively positive, negative and neutral visual stimuli. The magnitude of K-in(app) in the ventral striatum was positively correlated with BOLD signal increases in the left anterior cingulate cortex and right insular operculum elicited by positive vs. neutral stimuli, but not negative vs. neutral stimuli. In the dorsal striatum, the magnitude of K-in(app) was positively correlated with processing of positive and negative stimuli in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings suggest that dopamine synthesis capacity in the ventral striatum correlates with the attentional processing of rewarding positive stimuli in the anterior cingulate cortex of healthy subjects. Dopaminergic neurotransmission in the associative dorsal striatum has been associated previously with habit learning. The observed correlation between dopamine synthesis capacity in the dorsal striatum and BOLD signal changes in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex suggests dopaminergic modulation of processing of emotional stimuli in brain areas associated with motor planning and executive behaviour control.

Increased M1 muscarinic receptor binding in temporal cortex is associated with delusions in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) patients and increased M2/M4 receptor binding with psychosis in Alzheimer's disease. However, the relation between M2 and M4 muscarinic receptor and psychotic symptoms in DLB is unknown. The aim of this study was to measure M2 and M4 receptors in the anterior cingulate cortex in DLB and to correlate the neurochemical findings with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Muscarinic M2 and M4 receptor levels in the anterior cingulate cortex and adjacent cortex (Brodmann's area [BA] 32) were measured separately by using a radioligand binding protocol based on binding of [H-3]AF-DX 384 in the presence and absence of dicyclomine, a potent M4 receptor antagonist. M2 receptor binding was significantly increased, while M4 receptor binding was unchanged in the cingulate cortex and BA32 of DLB patients compared with age-matched controls. Impaired consciousness was significantly associated with increased M4 binding and delusions were significantly associated with increased M2 binding. Increased M2 and M4 receptor binding in DLB was also associated with visual hallucinations. Upregulation of M2 and M4 muscarinic receptors in cingulate and adjacent cortex may thus contribute to the development of psychosis in DLB, with potential implications for treatments with drugs acting on these receptors.

The vNTS2 polypeptide is 281 amino acids in length, which is 135 amino acids shorter than the full-length isoform. Immunohistochemical and radioligand binding studies revealed that the HA-tagged recombinant vNTS2 receptor is poorly targeted to plasma membranes in transfected COS-7 cells. Binding studies also showed that the truncated receptor displayed a 5000-fold lower affinity for neurotensin (NT) than its full-length counterpart (IC50 of 10 mu M and 2 nM, respectively). Yet NT binding induced efficient internalization of receptor-ligand complexes in vNTS2-transfected cells. Furthermore, it produced a rapid (< 5 min) activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (ERK1/2) pathway, indicating functional coupling of the variant receptor. This activation is sustained (> 1 h) and is also produced by the NTS2 agonist levocabastine. Western blotting experiments suggested that vNTS2 is not expressed in monomeric form in the rat central nervous system. However, it does appear to form a variety of multimeric complexes, including homodimers and heterodimers, with the full-length NTS2. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation studies in dually transfected cells demonstrated that the two receptor isoforms can form stable associations. Taken together, the present results indicated that the rat vNTS2 is a functional receptor that may play a role in NT signaling in mammalian central nervous system.

No previous studies have measured the beta(2)-adrenoceptor population in regenerating skeletal muscle or determined whether fenoterol can improve functional recovery in regenerating muscle after myotoxic injury. In the present study, the extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle of the right hindlimb of deeply anesthetized rats was injected with bupivacaine hydrochloride, which caused complete degeneration of all muscle fibers. The EDL muscle of the left hindlimb served as the uninjured control. Rats received either fenoterol (1.4 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1)) or an equal volume of saline for 2, 7, 14, or 21 days. Radioligand binding assays identified a similar to3.5-fold increase in beta(2)-adrenoceptor density in regenerating muscle at 2 days postinjury. Isometric contractile properties of rat EDL muscles were measured in vitro. At 14 and 21 days postinjury, maximum force production (P-o) of injured muscles from fenoterol-treated rats was 19 and 18% greater than from saline-treated rats, respectively, indicating more rapid restoration of function after injury. The increase in P-o in fenoterol-treated rats was due to increases in muscle mass, fiber cross-sectional area, and protein content. These findings suggest a physiological role for beta(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanisms in muscle regeneration and show clearly that fenoterol hastens recovery after injury, indicating its potential therapeutic application.

Evaluation of the compounds in a radioligand binding assay showed that they had no affinity to the rat liver AT(1) receptor. However, one of the compounds displayed considerable affinity to the pig uterus AT(2) receptor (K-i = 3.0 nM) while the other two lacked affinity to this receptor. It was hypothesized that the reason for the inactivity of one of these analogues to the AT(2) receptor was that the guanidino group of the Arg(2) residue and/or the N-terminal end of the pseudopeptide could not interact optimally with the receptor. To investigate this hypothesis, a conformational analysis was performed and a comparison was carried out with the monocyclic methylenedithioether analogue cyclo(S-CH2-S) [CyS3,5]-Ang II which is known to bind with high affinity to the AT(2) receptor (K-i = 0.62 nM). This comparison showed that, in the compounds with high AT(2) receptor affinity, the guanidino group of the Arg(2) residue and the N-terminal end could access common regions of space that were not accessible to the inactive compound. To examine the importance of the guanidino group for binding, the Arg side chain was removed by substituting Arg(2) for Ala(2) in the analogue having the high affinity. This analogue lacked affinity to AT(2) receptors, which supports the role of the guanidino group in receptor binding.

Medetomidine, an alpha(2)-AR agonist, belongs to 4-substituted imidazole class of compounds and is highly selective for the alpha(2)-AR. The benzylic methyl group of medetomidine and naphthalene imidazole was proposed to interact with rat brain alpha(2)-ARs via a methyl binding pocket in a manner analogous to its presence in alpha-methyl norepinephrine. A series of derivatives containing hydrophilic and hydrophobic substituents, as well as chiral and conformationally rigid analogs were used. In current binding and functional studies using human alpha(2)-AR subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, optimal interactions were observed with the presence of the methyl group on the benzylic carbon atom of naphthyl imidazole. Data obtained with various analogs have demonstrated that size, electronegativity, lipophilicity, chirality and conformational flexibility of the substituents at the carbon bridge of naphthyl imidazole are important factors for interaction of the imidazole class of ligands with these alpha(2)-AR subtypes. Taken collectively, the results obtained support the existence of the methyl bindin pocket for optimal ligand receptor binding interactions in human alpha(2)-AR subtypes. Further, the results also suggest that, additional modifications of medetomidine and naphthyl methyl imidazole at the benzylic carbon atom, and/or on the aromatic and imidazole ring systems could provide insights into the chemical requirements for optimizing alpha(2)-AR subtype selectivity. This could eventually lead to the discovery of promising compounds for the evaluation of the physiological importance of the three alpha(2)-AR subtypes. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The question remains whether these changes are mediated by a modified form of the nuclear estrogen receptor (ER) that is associated with the plasma membrane (mER) or by a completely novel membrane receptor. Therefore, we characterized the biochemical properties of the nuclear and membrane-associated ERs expressed endogenously in a rat hypothalamic endothelial cell line (D12). Radioligand binding experiments using D12 membrane fractions showed that these cells exhibit properties consistent with a binding site specific for estrogens (mER). Equilibrium binding assays using [I-125]16-alpha-iodo-3, 17beta-estradiol revealed saturable binding to mER, an affinity value similar to nuclear ER, with differing receptor expression levels. Competition assays revealed that 9 of 12 ER ligands tested had comparable affinities for mER and ER. For example, 17-alpha-estradiol and estrone had similar binding characteristics for both receptors while differences were noted for raloxifene, 17beta-estradiol (E2), and genistein. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses using antibodies specific for ERalpha confirmed that D12 cells expressed a membrane-associated protein with a molecular mass (67 kDa) similar to that of ERa that colocalized with caveolae-enriched membranes. A rapid increase in intracellar Ca2+ levels in the presence of E2 suggests that mER can mediate physiologic changes through calcium mobilization. These data support the expression of mER in these brain-derived endothelial cells that is similar to, but biochemically distinguishable from, nuclear ERalpha.

We investigated whether the expression of L-type Ca2+-channel subunits was reduced in atrial myocardium. of AF patients. Methods. - Right atrial appendages were obtained from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CAD, n = 35) or mitral valve surgery (MVD, n = 37). Seventeen of the CAD patients and 18 of the MVD patients were in chronic (>3 months) A-F, whereas the others were in SR. The protein expression of the L-type Ca2+-channel subunits alpha(1C) and beta(2) was quantified by western blot analysis. Furthermore, we measured the density of dihydropyridine (DHP)-binding sites of the L-type Ca2+ channel using H-3-PN220-100 as radioligand. Results. - Surprisingly, the alpha(1C) and the beta(2)-subunit expression was not altered in atrial myocardium of AF patients. Also, the DHP-binding site density was unchanged. Conclusion. - The protein expression of the L-type Ca2+-channel subunits alpha(1C) or beta(2) is not reduced in atrial myocardium of AF patients. Therefore, the reduced I-CaL might be due to downregulation of other accessory subunits (alpha(2)delta), expression of aberrant subunits, changes in channel trafficking or alterations in channel function.

The systolic blood pressure of 8-week-old SHR was statistically significantly higher than that of WKY rats (142 +/- 1 vs. 125 +/- 2 mm Hg). The plasma AVP levels were also significantly higher in SHR than in WKY rats (3.20 +/- 0.41 vs. 1.96 +/- 0.34 pg/ml). In SHR, the maximum capacity of H-3-d(CH2)(5)Tyr(Me)AVP binding to cortical V-1A receptors (B-max) was statistically significantly higher than that of WKY rats (39.7 +/- 2.7 vs. 22.4 +/- 0.9 fmol/mg protein). Furthermore, the B-max values of H-3-AVP binding to medullary V-2 receptors in SHR were also significantly higher than in WKY rats (40.2 +/- 1.9 vs. 28.3 +/- 1.3 fmol/mg protein). However, the apparent dissociation constant (K-d) values of renal cortex V-1A and medulla V-2 receptors in SHR and WKY rats were not significantly different. These results indicate that increased amounts of renal cortex V-1A and medulla V-2 receptors in SHR play an important role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Copyright (C) 2003 S.

As glutamatergic pathways play a pivotal role in epilepsy, to better characterize the molecular mechanisms of action of CBF 3381, the drug effects on the binding of the excitatory amino acid antagonist [H-3]-MK-801 in the presence of n-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), spermidine, or the combination of both ligands, were studied. CHF 3381 inhibited the [H-3]-MK-801 specific binding in a noncompetitive fashion in respect to NMDA and polyamines recognition sites. CHF 3381 failed to change the kinetic characteristic of glycine B receptors labeled with [H-3]-glycine; in contrast, it significantly increased K-d values when the receptors were labeled with the more specific compound [H-3]-MDL 105,519. CBF 3381 antagonized dopamine (DA)-induced behavioral responses and inhibited, in a glycine-dependent manner, the NMDA-induced [H-3]-DA release from rat striatal slices, but it failed to change either the kinetic characteristics of D-1, D-2, or D-3 receptors in synaptic plasma membranes (SPM) or the [H-3]-DA uptake from striatal synaptosomes. Moreover, in primary cell cultures of cortical neurons, this drug exhibited glycine-independent neuroprotective effects against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. It is concluded that this compound could have a potential use in several disease states where a pathological high level of NMDA receptor activation is thought to occur. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

Selected compounds were additionally investigated in binding assays at recombinant A(3) ARs. The 2-phenyl residue in (R)-7-(1-methylbenzyl)-2-phenylpyrrolo [2,3-d] pyrimidine-4-amine (ADPEP, 1) and in the corresponding pyrimido [4,5-b]indole (APEPI, 3) could be bioisosterically replaced by heterocyclic rings;such as 2-thienyl and 4-pyridyl. The resulting compounds retained high affinity and selectivity fdr Al ARs. Judging from the investigation of selected compounds, it appears that they are also potent at human Al ARs and selective not only versus A2A ARs but also highly selective versus A(2B) and A(3) ARs. The p-pyridyl-substituted derivatives 11 and 27 (APPPI) may be interesting pharmacological tools due to their fluorescent properties. Pyrrolo[2;3-d] pyrimidine-e-amine derivatives which were simultaneously substituted at N7 and N-4, combining the substitution pattern of ADPEP (1) and DPEAP (2), showed very low affinity for AL ARs. This finding supports our previously published hypothesis of different binding modes for pyrrolopyrimidines, such as ADPEP (1) and DPEAP (2). DPEAP (2), a pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidined-4-amine substituted gt the amino group (N4), was found to exhibit high affinity for human A(3) ARs (K-i = 28 nM), whereas N-4-unsubstituted analogues were inactive. DPEAP (2) and related compounds provide new leads for the development of antagonists for the human A(3) AR.

One quite recent and popular addition has been made by introducing bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET)-based binding assays for GPCRs, which are based on the fusion of nanoluciferase (Nluc) to the N-terminus of the receptor and the occurring energy transfer via BRET to a bound fluorescent ligand. However, being based on BRET, the technique is strongly dependent on the distance/orientation between the luciferase and the fluorescent ligand. Here we describe an alternative strategy to establish BRET-based binding assays for GPCRs, where the N-terminal fusion of Nluc did not result in functioning test systems with our fluorescent ligands (e.g., for the neuropeptide Y Y1 receptor (Y1R) and the neurotensin receptor type 1 (NTS1R)). Instead, we introduced Nluc into their second extracellular loop and we obtained binding data for the fluorescent ligands and reported standard ligands (in saturation and competition binding experiments, respectively) comparable to data from the literature. The strategy was transferred to the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1R) and the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1R), which led to affinity estimates comparable to data from radioligand binding experiments. Additionally, an analysis of the binding kinetics of all fluorescent ligands at their respective target was performed using the newly described receptor/Nluc-constructs.

Imaging brain cortisol regulation in PTSD with a target for 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION			English	Article							POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; MAJOR DEPRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CANNABIS USE; HPA-AXIS; IN-VIVO; MEMORY	BACKGROUND. Investigations of stress dysregulation in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have focused on peripheral cortisol, but none have examined cortisol in the human brain. This study used positron emission tomography (PET) to image 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11 beta-HSD1), a cortisol-producing enzyme, as a putative brain cortisol marker in PTSD. METHODS. Sixteen individuals with PTSD and 17 healthy, trauma-exposed controls (TCs) underwent PET imaging with [F-18] AS2471907, a radioligand for 11 beta-HSD1. RESULTS. Prefrontal-limbic 11 beta-HSD1 availability, estimated as [18F]AS2471907 volume of distribution (V-T), was significantly higher in the PTSD group compared with the TC group (beta = 1.16, P = 0.0057). Lower prefrontal-limbic 11 beta-HSD1 availability was related to greater overall PTSD severity (R-2 = 0.27, P = 0.038) in the PTSD group. 11 beta-HSD1 availability was not related to plasma cortisol levels (R-2 = 0.026, P = 0.37). In a PTSD subset (n = 10), higher 11 beta-HSD1 availability was associated with higher availability of translocator protein (TSPO), a microglial marker (beta = 4.40, P = 0.039). CONCLUSION. Higher brain cortisol-producing 11 beta-HSD1 in the PTSD group may represent a resilience-promoting neuroadaptation resulting in lower PTSD symptoms. Along with preliminary associations between 11 beta-HSD1 and TSPO, corroborating previous evidence of immune suppression in PTSD, these findings collectively challenge previous hypotheses of the deleterious effects of both excessive brain glucocorticoid and brain immune signaling in PTSD.

Recent research employing gender-affirming hormone treatment (GHT) of gender dysphoric individuals and utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) indicates increased serotonin transporter binding upon high-dosages of testosterone treatment. Here, we investigated the effects of GHT on levels of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), another key target of antidepressant treatment. Participants underwent PET with the radioligand [C-11] harmine to assess cerebral MAO-A distribution volumes (V-T) before and four months after initiation of GHT. By the time this study was terminated for technical reasons, 18 transgender individuals undergoing GHT (11 transmen, TM and 7 transwomen, TW) and 17 cis-gender subjects had been assessed. Preliminary analysis of available data revealed statistically significant MAO-A V-T reductions in TM under testosterone treatment in six of twelve a priori defined regions of interest (middle frontal cortex (-10%), anterior cingulate cortex (-9%), medial cingulate cortex (-10.5%), insula (-8%), amygdala (-9%) and hippocampus (-8.5%, all p<0.05)). MAO-A V-T did not change in TW receiving estrogen treatment. Despite the limited sample size, pronounced MAO-A V-T reduction could be observed, pointing towards a potential effect of testosterone. Considering MAO-A's central role in regulation of serotonergic neurotransmission, changes to MAO-A V-T should be further investigated as a possible mechanism by which testosterone mediates risk for, symptomatology of, and treatment response in affective disorders.

Thalamic neuroinflammation as a reproducible and discriminating signature for chronic low back pain	PAIN			English	Article						Chronic low back pain; Classification; Neuroinflammation; PET; MR	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; PROTEIN 18 KDA; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; PET RADIOLIGAND; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; GLIAL ACTIVATION; HUMAN BRAIN; BINDING; MICROGLIA	Using positron emission tomography, we recently demonstrated elevated brain levels of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a glial activation marker, in chronic low back pain (cLBP) patients, compared to healthy controls (HCs). Here, we first sought to replicate the original findings in an independent cohort (15 cLBP, 37.8 +/- 12.5 y/o; 18 HC, 48.2 +/- 12.8 y/o). We then trained random forest machine learning algorithms based on TSPO imaging features combining discovery and replication cohorts (totaling 25 cLBP, 42.4 +/- 13.2 y/o; 27 HC, 48.9 +/- 12.6 y/o), to explore whether image features other than the mean contain meaningful information that might contribute to the discrimination of cLBP patients and HC. Feature importance was ranked using SHapley Additive exPlanations values, and the classification performance (in terms of area under the curve values) of classifiers containing only the mean, other features, or all features was compared using the DeLong test. Both region-of-interest and voxelwise analyses replicated the original observation of thalamic TSPO signal elevations in cLBP patients compared to HC (P < 0.05). The random forest-based analyses revealed that although the mean is a discriminating feature, other features demonstrate similar level of importance, including the maximum, kurtosis, and entropy. Our observations suggest that thalamic neuroinflammatory signal is a reproducible and discriminating feature for cLBP, further supporting a role for glial activation in human cLBP, and the exploration of neuroinflammation as a therapeutic target for chronic pain. This work further shows that TSPO signal contains a richness of information that the simple mean might fail to capture completely.

CCL20-CCR6 axis directs sperm-oocyte interaction and its dysregulation correlates/associates with male infertility	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						acrosome reaction; capacitation; chemotaxis; cumulus cells; fertility; granulosa cells; male infertility; ovulatory cycle; seminal plasma; sperm capacitation; sperm motility and transport	HUMAN FOLLICULAR-FLUID; ACROSOME REACTION; HUMAN SPERMATOZOA; GENE-EXPRESSION; CATSPER CHANNEL; CUMULUS CELLS; RECEPTOR; CHEMOKINE; CHEMOTAXIS; MOTILITY	The interaction of sperm with the oocyte is pivotal during the process of mammalian fertilization. The limited numbers of sperm that reach the fallopian tube as well as anatomic restrictions indicate that human sperm-oocyte encounter is not a matter of chance but a directed process. Chemotaxis is the proposed mechanism for re-orientating sperm toward the source of a chemoattractant and hence to the oocyte. Chemokines represent a superfamily of small (8-11 kDa), cytokine-like proteins that have been shown to mediate chemotaxis and tissue-specific homing of leukocytes through binding to specific chemokine receptors such as CCRs. Here we show that CCR6 is abundantly expressed on human sperms and in human testes. Furthermore, radioligand-binding experiments showed that CCL20 bound human sperm in a specific manner. Conversely, granulosa cells of the oocyte-surrounding cumulus complex as well as human oocytes represent an abundant source of the CCR6-specific ligand CCL20. In human ovaries, CCL20 shows a cycle-dependent expression pattern with peak expression in the preovulatory phase and CCL20 protein induces chemotactic responses of human sperm. Neutralization of CCL20 in ovarian follicular fluid significantly impairs sperm migratory responses. Conversely, analyses in infertile men with inflammatory conditions of the reproductive organs demonstrate a significant increase of CCL20/CCR6 expression in testis and ejaculate. Taken together, findings of the present study suggest that CCR6-CCL20 interaction may represent an important factor in directing sperm-oocyte interaction. [GRAPHICS] .

In this study, we developed a novel PET probe ([F-18]VUIIS1018A) by targeting translocator protein (TSPO), an imaging biomarker for glioma. The purpose of this preclinical study was to evaluate this novel TSPO probe for glioma imaging.ProceduresIn this study, we synthesized [F-19]VUIIS1018A and the precursor for radiosynthesis of [F-18]VUIIS1018A. TSPO binding affinity was confirmed using a radioligand competitive binding assay in C6 glioma cell lysate. Further, dynamic imaging studies were performed in rats using a microPET system. These studies include displacement and blocking studies for ligand reversibility and specificity evaluation, and compartment modeling of PET data for pharmacokinetic parameter measurement using metabolite-corrected arterial input functions and PMOD.ResultsCompared to previously reported TSPO tracers including [F-18]VUIIS1008 and [F-18]DPA-714, the novel tracer [F-18]VUIIS1018A demonstrated higher binding affinity and BPND. Pretreatment with the cold analog [F-19]VUIIS1018A could partially block tumor accumulation of this novel tracer. Further, compartment modeling of this novel tracer also exhibited a greater tumor-to-background ratio, a higher tumor binding potential and a lower brain binding potential when compared with other TSPO probes, such as [F-18]DPA-714 and [F-18]VUIIS1008.ConclusionsThese studies illustrate that [F-18]VUIIS1018A can serve as a promising TSPO PET tracer for glioma imaging and potentially imaging of other solid tumors.

However, thus far, the translation of those findings into novel treatments for clinical use has been hindered by the scarcity of data supporting the role of neuroinflammation in human pain. Here, we show that patients suffering from a common chronic pain disorder (lumbar radiculopathy), compared with healthy volunteers, exhibit elevated levels of the neuroinflammation marker 18 kDa translocator protein, in both the neuroforamina (containing dorsal root ganglion and nerve roots) and spinal cord. These elevations demonstrated a pattern of spatial specificity correlating with the patients' clinical presentation, as they were observed in the neuroforamen ipsilateral to the symptomatic leg (compared with both contralateral neuroforamen in the same patients as well as to healthy controls) and in the most caudal spinal cord segments, which are known to process sensory information from the lumbosacral nerve roots affected in these patients (compared with more superior segments). Furthermore, the neuroforaminal translocator protein signal was associated with responses to fluoroscopy-guided epidural steroid injections, supporting its role as an imaging marker of neuroinflammation, and highlighting the clinical significance of these observations. These results implicate immunoactivation at multiple levels of the nervous system as a potentially important and clinically relevant mechanism in human radicular pain, and suggest that therapies targeting immune cell activation may be beneficial for chronic pain patients.

Methods: Ten healthy volunteers (5 women, 5 men; age +/- 6 SD, 34.3 +/- 6 6.5 y) were recruited, and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Series of whole-body PET/MRI examinations were acquired for up to 3 h after injection (357.2 +/- 6 48.8 MBq). Blood samples were collected, and standard vital signs (heart rate, pulse oximetry, and body temperature) were monitored at regular intervals. Regions of interest were delineated, time-activity curves were calculated, and organ uptake and dosimetry were estimated. Results: All subjects tolerated the PET/MRI examination well, and no adverse reactions to F-18-FTC-146 were reported. High accumulation of F-18-FTC-146 was observed in s-1 receptor-dense organs such as the pancreas and spleen, moderate uptake in the brain and myocardium, and low uptake in bone and muscle. High uptake was also observed in the kidneys and bladder, indicating renal tracer clearance. The effective dose of F-18-FTC-146 was 0.0259 +/- 0.0034 mSv/MBq (range, 0.0215-0.0301 mSv/MBq). Conclusion: First-in-human studies with clinical-grade F-18-FTC-146 were successful. Injection of F-18-FTC-146 is safe, and absorbed doses are acceptable. The potential of F-18-FTC-146 as an imaging agent for a variety of neuroinflammatory diseases is currently under investigation.

However, targeting the CXCR4 receptor with small cyclic pentapeptide-based radiopharmaceuticals remains challenging because minor structural modifications within the ligand-linker-chelate structure often significantly affect the receptor affinity. Based on the excellent in vivo properties of CXCR4-directed pentapeptide [Ga-68]pentixafor (cyclo(-D-Tyr-N-Me-D-Orn(AMB-DOTA)-L-Arg-L-2-Nal-Gly-)), this study aims to broaden the spectrum of applicable (radio) metal-labeled pentixafor analogs. Methods: Cyclic pentapeptides, based on the pentixafor scaffold, were synthesized by a combined solid-and solution-phase peptide synthesis. The CXCR4 receptor affinities of the cold reference compounds were determined in competitive binding assays using CXCR4-expressing Jurkat T-cell leukemia cells and [I-125]FC131 as the radioligand. Results: Metalated pentixafor derivatives with cyclic and acyclic chelators were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis and evaluated in vitro. The resulting CXCR4 affinities (IC50) were highly dependent on the chelator and metal used. Two pentapeptides, Ga-NOTA and Bi-DOTA conjugates, offer an improved affinity compared to [Ga-68]pentixafor. Conclusions: Based on the pentapeptide [Ga-68]pentixafor, a broad range of metal-labeled analogs were investigated. The affinities of the new compounds were found to be strongly dependent on both the chelator and the metal used. Bi-labeled pentixafor showed high receptor affinity and seems to be a promising ligand for further preclinical evaluation and future alpha-emitter-based endoradiotherapy.

A proportion of G protein-coupled receptor agonists and antagonists have been classified according to their duration of action, which influences their pharmacological efficacy. However, the duration of action of melatonin agonists remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the duration of action of melatonin agonists (melatonin, 2-iodomelatonin, ramelteon, and the ramelteon metabolite M-II) at the melatonin MT1 receptor, which is more resistant to agonist-induced desensitization than the melatonin MT2 receptor. In Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing the human melatonin MT1 receptor, significant differences in the duration of action were observed after 2-h pretreatment with agonists followed by washout. In contrast to melatonin and M-II, the agonist activities of ramelteon and 2-iodomelatonin were persistent (i.e. inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation and increase in ERK 1/2 phosphorylation) even after repeated washouts. Similar activities were observed for INS-1 cells endogenously expressing the rat MT1 receptor. Further, we examined potential factors linked to the duration of action. Residual activities of melatonin agonists after washout strongly correlated with their dissociation rates from the human melatonin MT1 receptor, but not their lipophilicity or extent of desensitization. These data suggest that the in vitro duration of action significantly differs between melatonin agonists and might dictate dissociation kinetics. Characterization of these in vitro properties may facilitate further in vivo study of the duration of action. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Caffeine increases striatal dopamine D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> receptor availability in the human brain	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ADENOSINE A(2A) RECEPTORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PRIMARY DEMETHYLATED METABOLITES; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; COCAINE ABUSERS; D-3 RECEPTORS; AMPHETAMINE; SHELL; MICE	Caffeine, the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world, is used to promote wakefulness and enhance alertness. Like other wake-promoting drugs (stimulants and modafinil), caffeine enhances dopamine (DA) signaling in the brain, which it does predominantly by antagonizing adenosine A(2A) receptors (A(2A)R). However, it is unclear if caffeine, at the doses consumed by humans, increases DA release or whether it modulates the functions of postsynaptic DA receptors through its interaction with adenosine receptors, which modulate them. We used positron emission tomography and [C-11]raclopride (DA D-2/D-3 receptor radioligand sensitive to endogenous DA) to assess if caffeine increased DA release in striatum in 20 healthy controls. Caffeine (300 mg p.o.) significantly increased the availability of D-2/D-3 receptors in putamen and ventral striatum, but not in caudate, when compared with placebo. In addition, caffeine-induced increases in D-2/D-3 receptor availability in the ventral striatum were associated with caffeine-induced increases in alertness. Our findings indicate that in the human brain, caffeine, at doses typically consumed, increases the availability of DA D-2/D-3 receptors, which indicates that caffeine does not increase DA in the striatum for this would have decreased D-2/D-3 receptor availability. Instead, we interpret our findings to reflect an increase in D-2/D-3 receptor levels in striatum with caffeine (or changes in affinity). The association between increases in D-2/D-3 receptor availability in ventral striatum and alertness suggests that caffeine might enhance arousal, in part, by upregulating D-2/D-3 receptors.

Fluorescence provides an alternative to more traditional approaches such as radio-ligand binding. Here we describe the binding and spectroscopic properties of eight fluorescent 5-HT3 receptor ligands. These were tested on purified receptors, expressed receptors on live cells, or in vivo. All compounds had nanomolar affinities with fluorescent properties extending from blue to near infra-red emission. A fluorescein-derivative had the highest affinity as measured by fluorescence polarization (FP; 1.14 nM), flow cytometry (FC; 3.23 nM) and radioligand binding (RB; 1.90 nM). Competition binding with unlabeled 5-HT3 receptor agonists (5-HT, mCPBG, quipazine) and antagonists (granisetron, palonosetron, tropisetron) yielded similar affinities in all three assays. When cysteine substitutions were introduced into the 5-HT3 receptor binding site the same changes in binding affinity were seen for both granisetron and the fluorescein-derivative, suggesting that they both adopt orientations that are consistent with co-crystal structures of granisetron with a homologous protein (5HTBP). As expected, in vivo live imaging in anaesthetized mice revealed staining in the abdominal cavity in intestines, but also in salivary glands. The unexpected presence of 5-HT3 receptors in mouse salivary glands was confirmed by Western blots. Overall, these results demonstrate the wide utility of our new high-affinity fluorescently-labeled 5-HT3 receptor probes, ranging from in vitro receptor pharmacology, including FC and FP ligand competition, to live imaging of 5-HT3 expressing tissues.

For this, we investigated the presence and the distribution of neurotensin binding sites in the human hypothalamus, using an in vitro quantitative autoradiography technique and the selective radioligand monoiodo-Tyr3-neurotensin (2000 Ci/mM). This study was performed on nine adult human postmortem hypothalami. We first determined the biochemical kinetics of the binding and found that binding affinity constants were of high affinity and do not differ significantly between all cases investigated. Our analysis of the autoradiographic distribution shows that NT binding sites are widely distributed throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the hypothalamus. However, the distribution of NT binding sites is not homogenous and regional variations exist. In general, the highest densities are mainly present in the anterior hypothalamic level, particularly in the preoptic region and the anterior boarding limit (i.e. the diagonal band of Broca). Important NT binding site densities are also present at the mediobasal hypothalamic level, particularly in the paraventricular, parafornical and dorsomedial nuclei. At the posterior level, relatively moderate densities could be observed in the mammillary complex subdivisions, apart from the supramammillary nucleus and the posterior hypothalamic area. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates the occurrence of high concentrations of NT binding sites in various structures in many regions in the human adult hypothalamus, involved in the control of neuroendocrine and/or neurovegetative functions.

Here, we have compared the pharmacological and signalling properties of wild-type (hH(3)R(WT)) and A280V mutant (hH(3)R(A280V)) receptors stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Experimental Approach The hH(3)R(A280V) cDNA was created by overlapping extension PCR amplification. Receptor expression and affinity were assessed by radioligand (N--[methyl-H-3]-histamine) binding to cell membranes, and receptor function by the inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation and stimulation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in intact cells, as well as stimulation of [S-35]-GTPS binding to cell membranes. Key Results Both receptors were expressed at similar levels with no significant differences in their affinities for H-3 receptor ligands. Upon activation the hH(3)R(WT) was significantly more efficacious to inhibit forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation and to stimulate [S-35]-GTPS binding, with no difference in pEC(50) estimates. The hH(3)R(WT) was also more efficacious to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but this difference was not significant. The inverse agonist ciproxifan was more efficacious at hH(3)R(WT) to reduce [S-35]-GTPS binding but, for both receptors, failed to enhance forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Conclusions and Implications The A280V mutation reduces the signalling efficacy of the human H-3 receptor. This effect may be relevant to the pathophysiology of disorders associated with the mutation.

Augmented sensitivity to methotrexate by curcumin induced overexpression of folate receptor in KG-1 cells	BIOCHIMIE			English	Article						Folate receptor; Curcumin; Methotrexate; KG-1 cells; Radioligand FR binding assay	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; MEDIATED TRANSPORT; MEMBRANE-TRANSPORT; LEUKEMIA-CELLS; TUMOR TARGET; MURINE L1210; APOPTOSIS; BETA; PROLIFERATION; EXPRESSION	Folate receptors are targets of various strategies aimed at efficient delivery of anti-cancer drugs. Folate receptors also play a role in the uptake of antifolate drugs which are used for therapeutic intervention in leukemia. Therefore, it is important to identify compounds which regulate expression of folate receptors in leukemic cells. The present study examined if curcumin could modulate the uptake and cytotoxicity of the antifolate drug methotrexate, in KG-1 leukemic cells. This is the first report to show that curcumin (10-50 mu M) causes a significant, dose-dependent, 2-3 fold increase in uptake of radiolabelled folic acid and methotrexate into KG-1 cells both at 24 h and 48 h of treatment. Interestingly, pre-treatment of KG-1 leukemic cells with curcumin (10 mu M and 25 mu M) also caused a statistically significant enhancement in the cytotoxicity of methotrexate. We performed Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR to confirm the upregulation of FR beta mRNA in curcumin treated cells. Immunocytochemistry and Western blotting showed that curcumin caused increased expression of folate receptor beta in KG-1 cells. Our data show that the mechanism of curcumin action involves up-regulation of folate receptor beta mRNA and protein in KG-1 cells. Therefore, combination of non-toxic concentrations of curcumin and methotrexate, may be a viable strategy for therapeutic intervention for leukemias using a folate receptor-targeted drug delivery system.

Changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission may contribute to the antidepressant response, yet the exact underlying mechanisms are unknown. Metabotropic glutamate receptors of subtype 5 (mGluR5) are importantly involved in modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission and neuronal plasticity. The density of these receptors is reduced in the brain of patients with MDD, particularly in brain structures involved in regulating wakefulness and sleep. We hypothesized that prolonged wakefulness would increase mGluR5 availability in human brain. Methods: Metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 binding was quantified with positron emission tomography in 22 young healthy men who completed two experimental blocks separated by 1 week. Two positron emission tomography examinations were conducted in randomized, crossover fashion with the highly selective radioligand, C-11-ABP688, once after 9 hours (sleep control) and once after 33 hours (sleep deprivation) of controlled wakefulness. C-11-ABP688 uptake was quantified in 13 volumes of interest with high mGluR5 expression and presumed involvement in sleep-wake regulation. Results: Sleep deprivation induced a global increase in mGluR5 binding when compared with sleep control (p < .006). In anterior cingulate cortex, insula, medial temporal lobe, parahippocampal gyrus, striatum, and amygdala, this increase correlated significantly with the sleep deprivation-induced increase in subjective sleepiness. Conclusions: This molecular imaging study demonstrates that cerebral functional mGluR5 availability is increased after a single night without sleep. Given that mGluR5 density is reduced in MDD, further research is warranted to examine whether this mechanism is involved in the potent antidepressant effect of wake therapy.

We report here the development of 3-(2-(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifzetidine) as a new putative high-affinity antagonist for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors. Nifzetidine in rat brain homogenate assays containing alpha 4 beta 2 sites labeled with H-3-cytisine exhibited a binding affinity: Ki=0.67 nM. The fluorine-18 analog, 3-(2-(5)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)pyridine (F-18-nifzetidine), was synthesized in 20%-40% yield, and apparent specific activity was estimated to be above 2 Ci/mu mol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding of F-18-nifzetidine to thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with alpha 4 beta 2 receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >85% by 150 mu M nicotine. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of F-18-nifzetidine in anesthetized rhesus monkey showed slow uptake in the various brain regions. Retention of (1)8(F)-nifzetidine was maximal in the thalamus and lateral geniculate followed by regions of the temporal and frontal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least uptake. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio was about 2.3 at 180 min postinjection and continued to rise. F-18-Nifzetidine shows promise as a new PET imaging agent for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. However, the slow kinetics suggests a need for >3-h PET scans for quantitative studies of the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The main barrier to reaching an atomic-level understanding of alcohol action is the low potency of alcohols, ethanol in particular, which is a reflection of transient, low-affinity interactions with their targets. These mechanisms are difficult or impossible to study with traditional techniques such as radioligand binding or spectroscopy. However, there has been considerable recent progress in combining X-ray crystallography, structural modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis to define the sites and mechanisms of action of ethanol and related alcohols on key brain proteins. We review such insights for several diverse classes of proteins including inwardly rectifying potassium, transient receptor potential, and neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, as well as protein kinase C epsilon. Some common themes are beginning to emerge from these proteins, including hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl group and van der Waals interactions of the methylene groups of ethanol with specific amino acid residues. The resulting binding energy is proposed to facilitate or stabilize low-energy state transitions in the bound proteins, allowing ethanol to act as a "molecular lubricant" for protein function. We discuss evidence for characteristic, discrete alcohol-binding sites on protein targets, as well as evidence that binding to some proteins is better characterized by an interaction region that can accommodate multiple molecules of ethanol.

Imaging dopamine receptors in humans with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]-(+)-PHNO: Dissection of D3 signal and anatomy	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						dopamine D3 receptors; PET; PHNO; region of interest; ROI; ventral striatum; VST; ventral pallidum; hypothalamus; extended amygdala	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PARTIAL VOLUME CORRECTION; IN-VIVO; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; HUMAN FOREBRAIN; D-3 RECEPTORS; HUMAN BRAIN; STRIATUM; PET; TRANSMISSION	[C-11]-(+)-PHNO is a D3 preferring PET radioligand which has recently opened the possibility of imaging D3 receptors in the human brain in vivo. This imaging tool allows characterisation of the distribution of D3 receptors in vivo and further investigation of their functional role. The specific [C-11]-(+)-PHNO signal is a mixture of D3 and D2 components with the relative magnitude of each component determined by the regional receptor densities. An accurate and reproducible delineation of regions of interest (ROI) is therefore important for optimal analysis of human PET data. We present a set of anatomical guidelines for the delineation of D3 relevant ROIs including substantia nigra, hypothalamus, ventral pallidum/substantia innominata, ventral striatum, globus pallidus and thalamus. Delineation of these structures using this approach allowed for high intra- and inter-operator reproducibility. Subsequently we used a selective D3 antagonist to dissect the total [C-11]-(+)-PHNO signal in each region into its D3 and D2 components and estimated the regional fraction of the D3 signal (f(PHNO)(D3)). In descending order of magnitude the following results for the f (D3)(PHNO) were obtained: hypothalamus = 100%, substantia nigra = 100%, ventral pallidum/substantia innominata = 75%, globus pallidus = 65%, thalamus = 43%, ventral striatum = 26% and precommissural-ventral putamen = 6%. An automated approach for the delineation of these anatomical regions of interest was also developed and investigated in terms of its reproducibility and accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> receptor in the neurohypophysis of hens	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						hen neurohypophysis; prostaglandin F-2 alpha receptor; receptor binding; arginine vasotocin release; oviposition	UTERUS SHELL GLAND; ARGININE VASOTOCIN RECEPTOR; GALLUS-DOMESTICUS; PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; OVULATORY CYCLE; F CONCENTRATION; NONLAYING HENS; LAYING HENS	To elucidate whether the receptor for prostaglandin (PG) F-2 alpha, one of PG, exists in the neurohypophysis in hens and whether the binding of receptor changes with relation to oviposition, the PGF(2 alpha) binding component in the membrane fraction of the neurohypophysis of laying hens was analyzed by radioligand binding assay using [5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15(n)-H-3] PGF(2 alpha). The binding component had characteristics of a receptor such as binding specificity, high affinity, and limited capacity for PGF(2 alpha). Scatchard analysis indicated that the binding site was of a single class. The binding capacity of the receptor was smaller in laying hens than in nonlaying hens, whereas the binding affinity was not significantly different between these hens. When nonlaying hens received an i.m. injection of estradiol-17 beta or progesterone (0.5 mg/hen), the specific binding of the PGF(2 alpha) receptor in the neurohypophysis was decreased. In laying hens, the specific binding decreased and the blood arginine vasotocin (AVT) concentration increased just after oviposition but did not change during a 24-h day in nonlaying hens. An i.v. injection of PGF(2 alpha) (2 mu g/hen) induced oviposition and caused an increase in the blood AVT concentration with a decrease in the specific binding of PGF(2 alpha) receptor. The present study suggests a possibility that PGF(2 alpha) may directly cause the AVT release from the neurohypophysis at oviposition time in hens.

In mothers' brains, radioligand binding assays revealed a significant decrease in the Bmax value, without any significant alteration in Kd value. Similar results were observed in the steady-state level of mGlu(1) and mGlu,5 receptors assayed by Western blot, suggesting that both receptor subtypes were modulated by chronic R-PIA treatment. mRNA coding mGlu(1) or mGlu(5) receptors was not altered, suggesting a posttranscriptional modulation as a possible mechanism of the loss of mGlu(1) and mGlu(5) receptors at the membrane surface. Moreover, phospholipase C stimulated by (R,S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG), a selective agonist of group I mGlu receptors, was also significantly decreased after R-PIA treatment, suggesting a heterologous desensitization of group I mGlu/PLC pathway in maternal brain. Western blot and RT-PCR assays showed that neither alpha G(q/11) nor PLC beta(1) was affected by R-PIA treatment. In fetal brain, no significant differences in mGlu receptors/PLC transduction pathway were observed after R-PIA treatment. These results suggest that chronic R-PIA intake during pregnancy modulates group I mGlu receptor signalling pathway in maternal brain, promoting a down-regulation of mGlu(1) and mGlu(5) receptors and a heterologous desensitization of the mGlu/PLC system.

Methods: 5-HT1A receptor function, at the level of receptor-G protein interaction, was assessed with quantitative autoradiography of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding stimulated by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT.5-HT1A receptor number was assessed by measuring the binding of the antagonist radioligand [H-3] WAY100635. Results: We observed a significant attenuation of 5-HT1A receptor function, in the absence of a change in receptor number, in the dorsal hippocampus of BDNF knockoutversus control mice.There was no difference between control and BDNF knockout mice in 5-HT1A receptor number or function in the dorsal or median raphe nuclei or medial prefrontal cortex or anterior cingulate cortex. Corticosterone treatment of control mice decreased 5-HT1A receptor function in the dorsal and median raphe but not in hippocampus or frontal cortical areas. The regulation of 5HT(1A) receptor number or function in the dorsal and median raphe by corticosterone was lost in BDNF knockout mice. Conclusions: Attenuation of BDNF expression in forebrain regions produces differential effects on distinct 5-HT1A receptor populations and on the regulation of these receptor populations by corticosterone.

Increased expression of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors in the rat dorsomedial striatum impairs instrumental learning	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						memory; cognition; serotonin; operant; viral gene transfer; behavior	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MEDIATED GENE-TRANSFER; MORRIS WATER MAZE; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; MOLECULAR-CLONING; FRONTAL-CORTEX; PC12 CELLS	A number of studies have shown that systemic 5-HT6 receptor antagonists can improve learning and memory, but the mechanism for these observations is not known. As striatum normally expresses 5-HT6 receptors abundantly and is important in consolidating stimulus-response learning, we used targeted gene delivery to further increase the expression of 5-HT6 receptors in rat striatum and then examined learning. Increased 5-HT6 expression had no effect on performance in the Morris water maze, a hippocampal-dependent learning paradigm, and did not alter the latency to approach or consume sucrose tablets. However, rats with increased 5-HT6 expression failed to acquire a reward-based instrumental learning task, a striatum-dependent learning model, during 3 days of successive sessions as compared to sham surgery or GFP-expressing control rats. This behavioral deficit was observed in rats overexpressing 5-HT6 receptors in the dorsomedial striatum, but not in rats with increased dorsocentral striatal expression. The 5-HT6 receptor- associated deficit was reversed by administration of a 5-HT6 antagonist, SB- 258585, before each training session. When animals learned the instrumental learning task before gene transfer, increased 5-HT6 receptor expression had no effect on long- term recall or performance of the task or on extinction of operant responding. Thus, 5-HT6 receptor activity in rat striatum disrupts acquisition of new instrumental learning but does not impair memory or performance of reward- motivated behavior once established.

Preclinical acute toxicity studies and dosimetry estimates of the novel sigma-1 receptor radiotracer, [<SUP>18</SUP>F]SFE	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						sigma receptor; PET; radiotracer; dosimetry; toxicity	IN-VIVO	[F-18]1-(2-Fluoroethyl)-4-[(4-cyanophenoxy)methyl]piperidine ([F-18]SFE) is a novel, selective, high-affinity sigma-1 receptor radioligand that has been preclinically well characterized in rodents. To support an investigational new drug (IND) application for the first evaluation of [18F]SFE in humans, single-organ and whole-body radiation adsorbed doses associated with [18F]SFE injection were estimated from rat distribution data. In addition, single- and multiple-dose toxicity studies were conducted in rabbits and in dogs. Multiple-dose toxicity studies in rabbits and single-dose toxicity studies in beagles suggest at least a 100-fold safety margin for humans studies at a mass dose limit of 4.0 mu g per intravenous injection, based on the combined no observable adverse effect levels (NOAEL, mg/m(2)) measured in these species. Radiation dosimetry estimates obtained from rat biodistribution analyses of [18 F]SFE suggest that most tissues would receive about 0.010-0.020 mGy/MBq, while the adrenal glands, brain, bone, liver, lungs, and spleen would receive slightly higher doses (0.024-0.044 mGy/MBq). The adrenal glands were identified as the critical organ, because they received the highest adsorbed radiation dose. The total exposure resulting from a 5 mCi administration of [18F]SFE is well below the FDA-defined limits for yearly cumulative and per-study exposures to research participants. These combined results support the expectation that [18F]SFE will be safe for use in human positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies with the administration of 5 mCi and a mass dose equal to or less than 4.0 mu g SFE per injection.

Thermodynamic data were obtained by performing these assays at different temperatures. In addition, cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP) assays were performed. 3 The presence of allosteric modulators had diverse effects on the affinity of LUF5831, N-6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), a full agonist, and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine ( DPCPX), an inverse agonist/ antagonist, for the adenosine A(1) receptor. PD81,723, for example, increased the affinity of CPA, while the affinity of LUF5831 was decreased. However, the affinity of DPCPX was decreased even more. In addition, LUF5831 was shown to have an affinity for the mutant ( T277A) adenosine A(1) receptor ( K-i 122 +/- 22 nM), whereas CPA's affinity was negligible. The results of temperature-dependent binding assays showed that the binding of LUF5831 was entropy driven, in between the behaviour of CPA binding to the high- and low-affinity states of the receptor, respectively. 4 The inhibition of the forskolin-induced production of cAMP through activation of the wt adenosine A(1) receptor showed that LUF5831 had a submaximal effect (37 +/- 1%) in comparison to CPA (66 +/- 5%). On the mutant receptor, however, neither CPA nor LUF5831 inhibited cAMP production. 5 This study indicates that the nonribose ligand, LUF5831, is a partial agonist for the adenosine A(1) receptor.

For example, adrenomedullin receptors are comprised of RAMP2 or RAMP3 ( AM1R and AM2R, respectively) and calcitonin receptor-like receptor ( CRLR), while a CRLR heterodimer with RAMP1 yields a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor. The major aim of this study was to determine the role of RAMPs in receptor trafficking. We hypothesized that a PDZ type I domain present in the C terminus of RAMP3, but not in RAMP1 or RAMP2, leads to protein-protein interactions that determine receptor trafficking. Employing adenylate cyclase assays, radioligand binding, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that in HEK293 cells the CRLR-RAMP complex undergoes agonist-stimulated desensitization and internalization and fails to resensitize (i.e. degradation of the receptor complex). Co-expression of N-ethylmaleimide- sensitive factor ( NSF) with the CRLR- RAMP3 complex, but not CRLR- RAMP1 or CRLR- RAMP2 complex, altered receptor trafficking to a recycling pathway. Mutational analysis of RAMP3, by deletion and point mutations, indicated that the PDZ motif of RAMP3 interacts with NSF to cause the change in trafficking. The role of RAMP3 and NSF in AM2R recycling was confirmed in rat mesangial cells, where RNA interference with RAMP3 and pharmacological inhibition of NSF both resulted in a lack of receptor resensitization/ recycling after agonist-stimulated desensitization. These findings provide the first functional difference between the AM1R and AM2R at the level of post-endocytic receptor trafficking. These results indicate a novel function for RAMP3 in the poste-endocytic sorting of the AM-R and suggest a broader regulatory role for RAMPs in receptor trafficking.

Thirteen chimeric melanocortin receptors were designed based on statistical molecular design; each chimera contained parts from three of the MC1,3-5 receptors. The binding affinities of 18 compounds were determined for these chimeric melanocortin receptors and the four wild-type melanocortin receptors. The data for 14 of these compounds were correlated to the physicochemical and structural descriptors of compounds, binary descriptors of receptor sequences, and cross-terms derived from ligand and receptor descriptors to obtain a proteochemometric model ( correlation was performed using partial least-squares projections to latent structures; PLS). A well fitted mathematical model (R-2 = 0.92) with high predictive ability (Q(2) = 0.79) was obtained. In a further validation of the model, the predictive ability for ligands (Q(2)lig = 0.68) and receptors (Q(2)rec = 0.76) was estimated. The model was moreover validated by external prediction by using the data for the four additional compounds that had not at all been included in the proteochemometric model; the analysis yielded a Q(2)ext = 0.73. An interpretation of the results using PLS coefficients revealed the influence of particular properties of organic compounds on their affinity to melanocortin receptors. Three-dimensional models of melanocortin receptors were also created, and physicochemical properties of the amino acids inside the receptors' transmembrane cavity were correlated to the PLS modeling results. The importance of particular amino acids for selective binding of organic compounds was estimated and used to outline the ligand recognition site in the melanocortin receptors.

Here, we used unnatural amino acid mutagenesis to introduce subtle changes to the side chains of tyrosine residues ( Tyr141, Tyr143, Tyr153, and Tyr234), which dominate the 5-HT3 receptor binding site. Heterologous expression in oocytes, combined with radioligand binding data and a model of 5-HT ( serotonin) computationally docked into the binding site, has allowed us to determine which of these residues are responsible for binding and/or gating. We have shown that Tyr 143 forms a hydrogen bond that is essential for receptor gating but does not affect binding, whereas a hydrogen bond formed by Tyr153 is involved in both binding and gating of the receptor. The aromatic group of Tyr234 is essential for binding and gating, whereas its hydroxyl does not affect binding but plays a steric role in receptor gating. Tyr141 is not involved in agonist binding or receptor gating but is important for antagonist interactions. These data, combined with a new model of the nonliganded 5-HT3 receptor, lead to a mechanistic explanation of the interactions that initiate the conformational change leading to channel opening. Thus, we suggest that agonist entry into the binding pocket may displace Tyr143 and Tyr153 and results in their forming new hydrogen bonds. These bonds may form part of the network of bond rearrangements that trigger the conformational change leading to channel opening. Similar rearrangements may initiate gating in all Cys-loop receptors.

However, other classes of BZD site ligands, including beta-carbolines, bind to these diazepam-insensitive receptor subtypes. Some beta-carbolines [e.g. ethyl beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (beta-CCE) and methyl 6,7-dimethoxy-4-ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate (DMCM)] display a higher affinity for alpha4- compared to alpha6-containing receptors. In order to identify the structural determinants that underlie these affinity differences, we constructed chimeric alpha6/alpha4 subunits and co-expressed these with wild-type rat beta2 and gamma2(L) subunits in tsA201 cells for radioligand binding analysis. After identification of candidate regions, site-directed mutagenesis was used to narrow the ligand selectivity to a single amino acid residue (alpha6N204/alpha4I203). Substitutions at alpha6N204 did not alter the affinity of the imidazobenzodiazepine Ro15-4513. A homologous mutation in the diazepam-sensitive alpha1 subunit (S205N) resulted in a 7-8-fold reduction in affinity for the beta-carbolines examined. Although the binding of the classical agonist flunitrazepam was relatively unaffected by this mutation in the alpha1 subunit, the affinity for Ro15-1788 and Ro15-4513 was decreased by similar to19-fold and similar to38-fold respectively. The importance of this residue, located in the Loop C region of the extracellular N-terminus of the subunit protein, emphasizes the differential interaction of ligands with the alpha subunit in diazepam-sensitive and -insensitive receptors.

Contractile responses to electrical field stimulation began at lower frequencies and were more persistent in the internal anal sphincter (IAS) than in the rectum. 2 Motor innervation to the IAS was almost exclusively sympathetic, since it was blocked by guanethidine (Guan 3 mum) while the response in the proximal rectum was approximately 50% muscarinic, and sensitive to the M-3 selective antagonist 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methylpiperidine (4-DAMP, 0.1 mum) and 50% tachykinergic, and sensitive to the neurokinin 2 (NK2) receptor antagonist GR 94800 (1 mum). From IAS to rectum there was a gradual shift in the relative contribution of intrinsic and extrinsic neural innervation. 3 Responses to exogenously applied transmitters exhibited a similar pattern to that observed with motor innervation. Norepinephrine (NE) was most potent in the IAS and acetylcholine, (ACh) and NK-A were most potent in the proximal rectum. The responses were inhibited by prazosin, 4-DAMP and GR 94800 respectively. 4 A gradient in the density of adrenergic alpha(1), muscarinic and NK2 receptors also existed from IAS to rectum as determined by measuring the binding of [H-3]-prazosin, [(3) H]-quinuclidinyl benzilate ([H-3]-QNB and [H-3]-SR-48968 to smooth muscle membranes. 5 In summary, these data suggest that the shift in motor innervation in the rectoanal region is achieved in part by changes in receptor populations available for activation by sympathetic and enteric motor neurons.

[I-125] SB-258585 is a selective 5-HT6R antagonist which has been well characterized for use in the rat brain. The present study evaluated its suitability for receptor autoradiography in the human brain and its application to quantitative studies. The affinity (K-d similar to 1. 2 nM) and relative distribution of binding sites (striatum >> cortex similar to hippocampus) were similar to the rat. The distribution of [I-125] SB-258585 binding in these regions was also consistent with that of 5-HT6R mRNA, determined in parallel using in situ hybridization. [I-125]SB-258585 binding site densities were measured in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 20 patients with chronic schizophrenia and compared with 17 normal subjects. No differences were seen between groups. Neither were [I-125] SB-258585 binding site densities affected in the frontal cortex or striatum of rats following 2 weeks' administration of the antipsychotic drugs haloperidol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine, risperidone, or clozapine. In summary, [I-125] SB-258585 is a suitable radioligand for studies of human brain 5-HT6R binding sites and shows that their distribution is broadly similar to that of the rodent. The lack of effect of schizophrenia or antipsychotic drug administration on [(ISB)-I-125-258585 binding suggests that an altered receptor density does not contribute to any involvement which the 5-HT6R may have in the disease or its treatment.

The pharmacological properties of 8-carboxamidocyclazocine were compared with the parent compound cyclazocine. Changing the 8-hydroxyl group on cyclazocine to an 8-carboxamido group resulted in only a 2-fold decrease in the affinity of the compound for the kappa-receptor, and no change in the affinity for the mu-opioid receptor, with both compounds having K-i values of less than 1 nM, based on radioligand binding assays. In the guanosine 5'-O-(3-[S-35]thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS) binding assay, the two compounds produced moderate stimulation of GTP binding to the human kappa- and mu-receptors. When given by i.c.v. injection, the compounds produced less than 60% antinociception in the mouse 55degreesC warm-water tail-flick test. However, in the mouse writhing test, the compounds had high potency in producing antinociception. Antinociception induced by either 8-carboxamidocyclazocine or cyclazocine was mediated by both kappa- and mu-opioid receptors. Cyclazocine acted as a mu-antagonist in addition to its agonist properties at the mu-receptor, as measured by the inhibition of morphine-induced antinociception. In contrast, 8-carboxamidocyclazocine did not inhibit morphine-induced antinociception, demonstrating that it was not a mu-opioid receptor antagonist in this assay. An i.p. injection of an ED70 dose of 8-carboxamidocyclazocine produced antinociception that lasted for 15 h in contrast to cyclazocine, which produced antinociception, lasting 2 h. 8-Carboxamidocyclazocine is a novel, long-acting benzomorphan, which possesses pharmacological properties that are distinct from the properties of cyclazocine.

Cetirizine and levocetirizine were 600-fold more selective for H-1 receptors compared with a panel of receptors and channels. Binding results indicated that the interaction between cetirizine, its enantiomers, and histamine is compatible with a competitive behavior, in contrast with the noncompetitive profile of cetirizine and levocetirizine observed in isolated organs. Binding kinetics provided a suitable explanation for this observation, because levocetirizine dissociated from H-1 receptors with a half-time of 142 min; that of (S)-cetirizine was only 6 min, implying that the former could act as a pseudo-irreversible antagonist in functional studies. The carboxylic function of levocetirizine seemed responsible for its long dissociation time. Indeed, hydroxyl or methyl ester analogs dissociated more rapidly from H-1 receptors, with half-times of 31 min and 7 min, respectively. The importance of the carboxylic function of levocetirizine for the interaction with the H, receptor was further supported by the results from the mutation of Lys(191) to Ala(191). This mutation decreased the dissociation half-time of levocetirizine from 142 to 13 min and reduced its affinity from 3 to 12 nM, whereas the affinity and dissociation kinetics of hydroxyl and methyl ester analogs were hardly affected. The mutation of Thr(194) reduced the binding stereoselectivity by selectively enhancing the affinity of the distomer.

To identify the cause for the lack of response, we examined the alpha (2) adrenoceptor in the platelets and their signal transduction pathways. No differences in the genomic (-2076 to 1526 bp) and coding region of alpha (2A) adrenoceptor complementary DNA (cDNA) were found between the responders (R) and nonresponders (NR). No expression of alpha (2B) or alpha (2C) adrenoceptor was detected in platelets. When UK14,304 was used to induce platelet aggregation, similar effect to Epi was observed between R and NR, and any involvement of the alpha (1) and beta adrenoceptor was ruled out. Radioligand binding assay showed similar number of alpha (2) binding sites between the two groups (139 +/- 25/platelet vs. 145 +/- 37/platelets). However, platelets from NR showed a weaker response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP, 52.3 +/- 17.8% vs. 80.5 +/- 8.7% from R, P < .01). In the presence of P2Y(1) antagonist adenosine 3',5'-diphosphosulfate (A3P5PS), ADP failed to induce platelet aggregation in NR (7.8 +/- 4.7% vs. 64.7 +/- 11.2% in R, P < .01). Addition of SQ22,536 to inhibit adenylyl cyclase did not convert NR to R. These observations demonstrate that there is an impaired platelet responsiveness to ADP as well as to Epi in NR, due to a difference in downstream of the signal transduction pathway but independent of adenylyl cyclase inhibition.

J	Christopoulos, A; Wilson, K				Christopoulos, A; Wilson, K			Interaction of anandamide with the M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>4</sub> muscarinic acetylcholine receptors	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						acetylcholine; anandamide; cannabinoid; muscarinic receptors; memory	CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION; BINDING; MEMORY; BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGY; AGONIST; ENDOCANNABINOIDS; INHIBITION; PLASTICITY	The M-1 and M-4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors are the most abundant muscarinic receptor subtypes in the brain, and are involved in learning and memory, Because cannabinoid receptors are also abundantly expressed in similar brain regions and mediate opposite effects to acetylcholine on cognition, the present study investigated whether the endocannabinoid agonist, anandamide, and its metabolically stable derivative, methanandamide, directly modified the binding properties of the human M-1 and M-4 receptors individually expressed in CHO cell membranes. Experiments utilized the antagonists, [H-3]N-methylscopolamine and [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate. When acetylcholine was used as the inhibiting ligand, shallow, biphasic isotherms were observed at both receptors, characterised by similar apparent dissociation constants for high and low affinity binding at each receptor but with a greater proportion of high affinity sites at the M-4 (40-45%) than at the M-1 receptor (17-20%). In contrast, anandamide and methanandamide inhibited the binding of both radioligands over a narrow (low micromolar) concentration range. with monophasic isotherms characterized by Hill coefficients significantly greater than 1 at both receptors. These effects were not due to the vehicle used. Further saturation binding analyses found anandamide able to significantly reduce the apparent affinity and maximal density of binding sites labeled by [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate. Interestingly, no significant inhibition of radioligand binding was noted using the synthetic cannabinoid agonist. WIN55212-2, or the cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716A. These data thus provide evidence for a direct role of anandamides in modulating muscarinic receptor binding properties through a non-competitive mechanism that is unrelated to their actions on cannabinoid receptors.

Male Sprague-Dawley pups were injected with CLI-HCl (40 mg/kg/day) from age 8 to 21 days. At age 4 weeks, rats were assigned to one of five conditions: (1) sedentary; (2) 24-h access to an activity wheel; (3) sedentary + imipramine-HCl (10 mg/kg/twice daily) during the last 10 days of the experiment; (4) wheel running + imipramine; (5) daily treadmill running. At age 16 weeks, rats underwent sex behavior testing. The rate of copulation was lower in the sedentary CLI-treated group than in the saline controls. Reductions in measures of sexual arousal and levels of monoamines were consistent with the CLI model of depression but were smaller than expected. Wheel runners had more frequent mounts, intromissions, and ejaculations relative to the other groups. Norepineplurine levels in brain frontal cortex were higher in all running groups and the imipramine group relative to the sedentary CLI and saline groups. Radioligand [I-125] binding density (B-Max) of beta -adrenoceptors in frontal cortex was lower for the wheel running, imipramine, and wheel running + imipramine groups. Activity wheel running equaled imipramine treatment for increasing norepinephrine and decreasing B-Max, and it exceeded imipramine treatment for increasing male copulatory performance. We conclude that activity wheel running favorably influences several hallmark pharmaco-physioiogical and behavioral measures of an antidepressant effect but did not alter sexual arousal, a surrogate measure of anhedonia. The weaker than expected effects of CLI treatment indicate that the generalizability of the CLI model requires further elucidation using convergent behavioral, biochemical, and pharmacological measures.

The flutemetamol analogue cyano-flutemetamol detects myocardial AL and ATTR amyloid deposits: a post-mortem histofluorescence analysis	AMYLOID-JOURNAL OF PROTEIN FOLDING DISORDERS			English	Article						amyloid; cardiac; flutemetamol; lambda light chain; positron emission tomography; transthyretin	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SENILE SYSTEMIC AMYLOIDOSIS; COMPOUND B PET; CARDIAC AMYLOIDOSIS; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; ENDOMYOCARDIAL BIOPSY; NONINVASIVE DETECTION; VISUALIZATION; C-11-PIB; F-18-FLORBETABEN	Background[F-18]flutemetamol is a PET radioligand used to image brain amyloid, but its detection of myocardial amyloid is not well-characterized. This histological study characterized binding of fluorescently labeled flutemetamol (cyano-flutemetamol) to amyloid deposits in myocardium.MethodsMyocardial tissue was obtained post-mortem from 29 subjects with cardiac amyloidosis including transthyretin wild-type (ATTRwt), hereditary/variant transthyretin (ATTRv) and immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) types, and from 10 cardiac amyloid-free controls. Most subjects had antemortem electrocardiography, echocardiography, SPECT and cardiac MRI. Cyano-flutemetamol labeling patterns and integrated density values were evaluated relative to fluorescent derivatives of Congo red (X-34) and Pittsburgh compound-B (cyano-PiB).ResultsCyano-flutemetamol labeling was not detectable in control subjects. In subjects with cardiac amyloidosis, cyano-flutemetamol labeling matched X-34- and cyano-PiB-labeled, and transthyretin- or lambda light chain-immunoreactive, amyloid deposits and was prevented by formic acid pre-treatment of myocardial sections. Cyano-flutemetamol mean fluorescence intensity, when adjusted for X-34 signal, was higher in the ATTRwt than the AL group. Cyano-flutemetamol integrated density correlated strongly with echocardiography measures of ventricular septal thickness and posterior wall thickness, and with heart mass.ConclusionThe high selectivity of cyano-flutemetamol binding to myocardial amyloid supports the diagnostic utility of [F-18]flutemetamol PET imaging in patients with ATTR and AL types of cardiac amyloidosis.

Prompted by the recent breakthrough of Cu-67 production with high specific activity, high radionuclidic purity, and sufficient quantities, the interest in the theranostic potential of Cu-67 has been rekindled. This work addresses the practicability of developing Cu-67-labeled antibodies with substantially improved quality for cancer radioimmunotheranostics. Proof of concept is demonstrated with pertuzumab, a US-FDA-approved monoclonal antibody for combination therapies of HER2-positive breast cancer. With an average number of 1.9 chelators coupled to each antibody, we achieved a two-order of magnitude increase in radiolabeling efficiency compared to literature reports. In a preclinical therapeutic study, mice (n=4-7/group) bearing HER2(+) xenografts exhibited a Cu-67-dose dependent tumor-growth inhibition from Cu-67-labeled-Pertuzumab co-administered with trastuzumab. Furthermore, greater tumor size reduction was observed with Cu-67-labeled-pertuzumab formulations of higher specific activity. The potential of SPECT imaging with Cu-67 radiopharmaceuticals was tested after Cu-67-labeled-Pertuzumab administration. Impressively, all tumors were clearly visualized by SPECT imaging with Cu-67-labeled-Pertuzumab even at day 5 post injection. This work demonstrates it is practical to use Cu-67 radioimmunoconjugates for cancer radioimmunotheranostics.

Three series of novel gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R) ligands belonging to imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles, imidazo[2,1-b] [1,3,4]thiadiazoles, and benzo [d] imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles were synthesized and characterized as active agents against GABA(A)R benzodiazepine-binding site. In each of these series, potent compounds were discovered using a radioligand competition binding assay. The functional properties of highest-affinity compounds 28 and 37 as GABA(A)R positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) were determined by electrophysiological measurements. In vivo studies on zebrafish demonstrated their potential for the further development of anxiolytics. Using the OECD "Fish, Acute Toxicity Test" active compounds were found safe and non-toxic. Structural bases for activity of benzo[d]imidazo[2,1-b]thiazoles were proposed using molecular docking studies. The isosteric replacement of the pyridine nuclei by 1,3-thiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, or 1,3-benzothiazole in the ring-fused imidazole class of GABA(A)R PAMs was shown to be promising for the development of novel hypnotics, anxiolytics, anticonvulsants, and sedatives drug-candidates.

Evaluating Cholinergic Receptor Expression in Guinea Pig Primary Auditory and Rostral Belt Cortices After Noise Damage Using [<SUP>3</SUP>H]Scopolamine and [<SUP>18</SUP>F]Flubatine Autoradiography	MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						autoradiography; hearing loss; muscarinic receptors; nicotinic receptors; radioligand binding	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; INDUCED HEARING-LOSS; TIMING-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; CROSSMODAL PLASTICITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; RAT-BRAIN; LOCALIZATION; EXPOSURE; TINNITUS; SUBTYPES	Noise-induced hearing loss leads to anatomic and physiologic changes in primary auditory cortex (A1) and the adjacent dorsal rostral belt (RB). Since acetylcholine is known to modulate plasticity in other cortical areas, changes in A1 and RB following noise damage may be due to changes in cholinergic receptor expression. We used [H-3]scopolamine and [F-18]flubatine binding to measure muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression, respectively, in guinea pig A1 and RB 3 weeks following unilateral, left ear noise exposure, and a temporary threshold shift in hearing. [H-3]Scopolamine binding decreased in right A1 and RB (contralateral to noise) compared to sham controls across all cortical layers. [F-18]Flubatine binding showed a nonsignificant upward trend in right A1 following noise but only significantly increased in right RB and 2 layers of left RB (ipsilateral to noise). This selective response may ultimately influence cortical plasticity and function. The mechanism(s) by which cholinergic receptors are altered following noise exposure remain unknown. However, these data demonstrate noise exposure may differentially influence mAChRs that typically populate interneurons in A1 and RB more than nAChRs that are traditionally located on thalamocortical projections and provide motivation for cholinergic imaging in clinical patient populations of temporary or permanent hearing loss.

However, the radiolabeled metabolite of [F-18]5 can accumulate in the brain. In this study, using [F-18]5 as a lead compound, we designed four new F-18-labeled ligands ([F-18]6-9) to find one more suitable than [F-18]5. Of these, 2-(2-(3-(4-([F-18]fluoromethoxy-d(2))phenyl)-4-oxo-3,4-dihydroquinazolin-2-yl)ethyl)-4-isopropoxyisoindoline-1,3-dione ([F-18]9) exhibited high in vitro binding affinity (K-i = 2.9 nM) to PDE10A and suitable lipophilicity (LogD = 2.2). In PET studies, the binding potential (BPND) of [F-18]9 (5.8) to PDE10A in rat brains was significantly higher than that of [F-18]5 (4.6). Furthermore, metabolite analysis showed much lower levels of contamination with radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]9 in the brain than those of [F-18]5. In conclusion, [F-18]9 is a useful PET ligand for PDE10A imaging in brain.

Repeat doses of antibody to serum amyloid P component clear amyloid deposits in patients with systemic amyloidosis	SCIENCE TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE			English	Article							AL AMYLOIDOSIS; PHARMACOLOGICAL DEPLETION; SCINTIGRAPHY; COMPLEMENT; TURNOVER; VOLUME; LIVER	Systemic amyloidosis is a fatal disorder caused by pathological extracellular deposits of amyloid fibrils that are always coated with the normal plasma protein, serum amyloid P component (SAP). The small-molecule drug, miridesap, -[(R)-1-[ 6-[(R)-2-carboxy-pyrrolidin-1-yl]-6-oxo-hexanoyl] pyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid (CPHPC)] depletes circulating SAP but leaves some SAP in amyloid deposits. This residual SAP is a specific target for dezamizumab, a fully humanized monoclonal IgG1 anti-SAP antibody that triggers immunotherapeutic clearance of amyloid. We report the safety, pharmacokinetics, and dose-response effects of up to three cycles of miridesap followed by dezamizumab in 23 adult subjects with systemic amyloidosis (ClinicalTrials. gov identifier: NCT01777243). Amyloid load was measured scintigraphically by amyloid-specific radioligand binding of I-123-labeled SAP or of Tc-99m-3,3-diphosphono1,2- -propanodicarboxylic acid. Organ extracellular volume was measured by equilibrium magnetic resonance imaging and liver stiffness by transient elastography. The treatment was well tolerated with the main adverse event being self-limiting early onset rashes after higher antibody doses related to whole body amyloid load. Progressive dose-related clearance of hepatic amyloid was associated with improved liver function tests. I-123-SAP scintigraphy confirmed amyloid removal from the spleen and kidneys. No adverse cardiac events attributable to the intervention occurred in the six subjects with cardiac amyloidosis. Amyloid load reduction by miridesap treatment followed by dezamizumab has the potential to improve management and outcome in systemic amyloidosis.

WAY100635 is a well-known high affinity 5-HT1A receptor antagonist. Many C-11 and F-18 radiolabeled derivatives and its radioiodinated analogues have been reported as imaging agents for 5-HT1A receptors. In this regard, the synthesis, radiolabeling and biological evaluation of a new 5-HT1A receptor radioligand, k[I-125]-1-(2-(benzylthio)ethyl)-4-(5-iodo-2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine ([I-125]-BTE-IMPP), are described. Radioiodination of this newly synthesized compound was done by the direct aromatic electrophilic substitution via Iodo-Gen method. Radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity determined by TLC and RTLC were > 70% and > 95%, respectively. Biodistribution studies of [I-125]-BTE-IMPP in rats displayed relatively high uptake in hippocampus (Hip) and low uptake in cerebellum (Cer). The level of the radiotracer uptake was over threefold higher in hippocampus than in cerebellum at 30 min post-injection. Moreover, the brain to blood uptake ratio and the blocking studies results indicated prolonged retention of the radiotracer and relatively good specific binding to 5-HT1A receptor. These findings strongly suggest that [I-125]-BTE-IMPP could be a good candidate as an in vivo marker for pharmacological study of 5-HT1A receptors in animal models.

Thus, PET is the diagnostic method of choice, using radiolabeled NET-ligands derived from reboxetine. So far, [F-18]FMeNER-D2 showed best pharmacokinetic and -dynamic properties. However, the disadvantage of reboxetine derived PET tracers is their high metabolic cleavage-resulting in impeding signals in the PET scans, which hamper a proper quantification of the NET in cortical areas. Methods: Metabolic stability testing was performed in vitro using a plethora of human and murine enzymes. Results: No metabolism was observed using monoamine oxidase A and B or catechol-O-methyl transferase. Incubation of [F-18]FMeNER-D2 with CYP450-enzymes, predominantly located in the liver, led to a significant and fast metabolism of the tracer. Moreover, the arising three radiometabolites were found to be more polar than [F-18] FMeNER-D2. Surprisingly, definitely no formation of free [F-18]fluoride was observed. Conclusion: According to our in vitro data, the interfering uptake in cortical regions might be attributed to these emerging radiometabolites but does not reflect bonding in bone due to defluorination. Further research on these radiometabolites is necessary to elucidate the in vivo situation. This might include an analysis of human blood samples after injection of [F-18]FMeNER-D2, to enable a better correction of the PET-input function. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Synthesis and Evaluation of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]RAGER: A First Generation Small-Molecule PET Radioligand Targeting the Receptor for Advanced Glycation Endproducts	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						RAGE; radiotracer; positron emission tomography; fluorine-18	BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; TRANSGENIC MOUSE MODEL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; END-PRODUCTS; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; IN-VIVO; RAGE; ACCUMULATION; RADIOTRACER; ASTROCYTES	The receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is a 35 kDa transmembrane receptor that belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface molecules. Its role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is complex, but it is thought to mediate influx of circulating amyloid-beta into the brain as well as amplify A beta-induced pathogenic responses. RAGE is therefore of considerable interest as both a diagnostic and a therapeutic target in AD. Herein we report the synthesis and preliminary preclinical evaluation of [F-18]RAGER, the first small molecule PET radiotracer for RAGE (K-d = 15 nM). Docking studies proposed a likely binding interaction between RAGE and RAGER, [F-18]RAGER autoradiography showed colocalization with RAGE identified by immunohistochemistry in AD brain samples, and [F-18]RAGER microPET confirmed CNS penetration and increased uptake in areas of the brain known to express RAGE. This first generation radiotracer represents initial proof-of-concept and a promising first step toward quantifying CNS RAGE activity using PET. However, there were high levels of nonspecific [F-18]RAGER binding in vitro, likely due to its high log P (experimental log P = 3.5), and rapid metabolism of [F-18]RAGER in rat liver microsome studies. Therefore, development of second generation ligands with improved imaging properties would be advantageous prior to anticipated translation into clinical PET imaging studies.

Quantitative positron emission tomography of mGluR5 in rat brain with [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PSS232 at minimal invasiveness and reduced model complexity	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						area under the curve; cannulation; mGluR5; quantitative PET; radiometabolite; receptor imaging	GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR SUBTYPE-5; PRECLINICAL EVALUATION; HYPERTENSIVE-RATS; REFERENCE TISSUE; F-18-FDG PET; 5 MGLU(5); IN-VIVO; QUANTIFICATION; VOLUME; ARTERIAL	Imaging the density of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) in brain by positron emission tomography (PET) is of interest in relation to several brain disorders. We have recently introduced [F-18]PSS232, an F-18-labeled analog of the mGluR5-targeting [C-11]ABP688. Quantitative PET requires kinetic modeling with an input function (IF) or an appropriate reference tissue model. We aimed at minimizing invasiveness of IF recording in rat and employing this protocol for mGluR5 quantitative PET with [F-18]PSS232. We further aimed at defining models of low complexity for quantitative PET with [F-18]PSS232. The IF was recorded in an arterio-venous shunt applied by minimally invasive cannulation. PET data were analyzed with a modified two-tissue compartment model including a single variable for radiometabolite correction in brain. We further evaluated a simple reference tissue model. Receptor-dependent accumulation was similar to [C-11]ABP688 at lower unspecific accumulation of unchanged [F-18]PSS232, in agreement with its higher plasma protein binding and lower lipophilicity. The minimally invasive protocol revealed similar results as the invasive shunt method and parameters calculated with themodified two-tissue compartment model were similar to those calculated with the standard model. The simple area under the curve ratios agreed with the Logan reference method. [F-18]PSS232 is a promising radioligand for mGluR5 quantification.

Normal-appearing white matter and GM, despite seeming normal in conventional mangnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are important loci of widespread inflammation, neuronal damage, and source of progressive disability in multiple sclerosis (MS). Dynamic PET imaging using A2AR-specific [C-11]TMSX and brain MRI with diffusion tensor imaging were performed to eight SPMS patients and seven healthy controls. Distribution volumes (V-T) of [C-11]TMSX were analyzed from 13 regions of interest using Logan plot with arterial plasma input. The SPMS patients had significantly increased [C-11]TMSX-VT in NAWM compared with controls (mean (s.d.): 0.55 (+/- 0.08) vs. 0.45 (+/- 0.05); P = 0.036). Both the increased VT and the decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in NAWM were associated with higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores (P = 0.030 and P = 0.012, respectively), whereas the T2-lesion load of SPMS patients did not correlate with EDSS. This study shows, that A2ARs are increased in the brain of SPMS patients, and that [C-11]TMSX-PET provides a novel approach to learn about central nervous system pathology in SPMS in vivo.

The muscarinic M<sub>4</sub> receptor is the functionally predominant subtype in rat and mouse striatum as demonstrated using [<SUP>35</SUP>S] GTPγS binding	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Muscarinic 4 receptor; Native tissue; Rat striatum; Knock-out mouse; GTP gamma S binding assay	SELECTIVE ANTAGONISTS; AGONIST; XANOMELINE; M4; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PHARMACOLOGY; INHIBITION; TISSUE; TOXIN; BRAIN	We have used selective muscarinic receptor antagonists and M-2 and M-4 receptor knockout (KO) mouse tissue to define the functional muscarinic acetylcholine receptor populations in rodent striatum. [H-3] NMS binding studies in rat and mouse striatum demonstrated that approximately 30% of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors expressed are M-1 receptors. Radioligand binding studies suggest that the remaining muscarinic acetylcholine receptor population is largely M-4 with small levels of M-2. In agreement, carbachol-induced GTP gamma S binding studies in M-2 and M-4 receptor KO mouse striatum implicated the M-4 receptor as the predominant functional receptor subtype. Based on these data we have developed a novel, native tissue M-4 receptor [S-35] GTP gamma S binding assay. Pharmacological assessment of M-4 receptor agonist and positive 3modulators revealed clear differences in the potencies observed in a human recombinant CHO-M-4 receptor [S-35] GTP gamma S binding assay as compared to the native tissue [S-35] GTP gamma S binding assay. These differences are believed to reflect differences in receptor reserve between the assay systems as well as differences in compound pharmacology (relative contribution of compound affinity and efficacy to observed potency). These studies have demonstrated the importance of understanding the pharmacology of test compounds in a native environment when predicting in vivo response. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In competition binding experiments, we found that classic biogenic amine transporter inhibitors displaced [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding at its high-affinity binding sites in HeLaS3 cells. [I-125]RTI-55 and [H-3]paroxetine are known to specifically label amine transporter sites, and this was observed in our cells. Displacement studies showed that 8-OH-DPAT displayed affinity in a dose-dependent manner for the labeled amine transporter sites. These data suggest that [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binds to amine uptake sites in HeLaS3 cells. A variety of drugs targeting different classes of receptors did not significantly affect [H-3]8-OH-DPAT binding. Moreover, we determined the specific binding effects of various serotonergic ligands (i.e. [I-125]cyanopindolol, [H-3]ketanserin/[H-3]mesulergine, [H-3]GR-65630, [H-3]GR-113808 and [H-3]LSD) that specifically labeled 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5HT(3), 5-HT4 and 5-HT5-7 receptors, respectively. It is suggested that HeLaS3 cells contain distinct types of the related to 5-HT receptor recognition binding sites. These observations could help elucidate the relevant characteristics of different types of 5-HT receptors and 5-HT membrane transporters in tumor cells and their role in tumorigenesis.

Transforming Growth Factor-α Enhances Corneal Epithelial Cell Migration by Promoting EGFR Recycling	INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY & VISUAL SCIENCE			English	Article							FACTOR RECEPTOR; ENDOCYTIC TRAFFICKING; ACTIVATION; DIFFERENTIATION; PROLIFERATION; LOCALIZATION; CHEMOTAXIS; EXPRESSION; MEMBRANE; MOTILITY	PURPOSE. The goal of this study was to determine the molecular mechanism by which transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is a more potent activator of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mediated corneal wound healing than epidermal growth factor (EGF). METHODS. Telomerase immortalized human corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells and primary human corneal epithelial cells were tested for their ability to migrate in response to EGF and TGF-alpha. In parallel, the endocytic trafficking of the EGFR in response to these same ligands was examined using indirect immunofluorescence, immunoblots, and radioligand binding. RESULTS. TGF-alpha, compared with EGF, is a more potent activator of corneal epithelial cell migration. Although both TGF-alpha and EGF were able to induce EGFR internalization and phosphorylation, only those receptors that were stimulated with EGF progressed to lysosomal degradation. EGFRs stimulated with TGF-alpha recycled back to the plasma membrane, where they could be reactivated with ligand. CONCLUSIONS. This study reveals that EGFR-mediated cell migration is limited by ligand-stimulated downregulation of the EGFR. This limitation can be overcome by treating cells with TGF-alpha because TGF-alpha stimulates EGFR endocytosis, but not degradation. After internalization of the TGF-alpha/EGFR complex, EGFR recycles back to the plasma membrane, where it can be restimulated. This sequence of events provides the receptor multiple opportunities for stimulation. Thus, stimulation with TGF-alpha prolongs EGFR signaling compared with EGF.

AM404, at the concentration of 3 mu M and higher, caused a significant inhibition of Ca-45(2+) fluxes. Radioligand binding studies indicated that the specific binding of [H-3] Isradipine to transverse tubule membranes was also inhibited significantly by AM404. In controls and in presence of 10 mu M AM404, B-max values were 51 +/- 6 and 27 +/- 5 pM/mg, and KD values were 236 +/- 43 and 220 +/- 37 pM, respectively. Inhibitory effects of AEA and arachidonic add on Ca-45(2+) flux and [H-3]Isradipine binding reported in earlier studies, were also enhanced significantly in the presence of AM404. In the presence of VDM11 (1 mu M), another anandamide transport inhibitor. AM404 continued to inhibit Ca-45(2+) fluxes and [H-3]Isradipine binding. In rat myotubes, Ca2+ currents through L-type Ca2+ channels recorded in whole-cell configuration of patch clamp technique were inhibited by AM404 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 3.2 mu M.

Methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization in mice:: alterations in <i>μ</i>-opioid receptor	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						mu-opioid receptor; behavioral sensitization; constitutive activity; DAMGO; G protein; methamphetamine; neuroadaptations	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; PROENKEPHALIN MESSENGER-RNA; INDUCED LOCOMOTOR-ACTIVITY; BASAL SIGNALING ACTIVITY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINE-RECEPTOR; AMPHETAMINE SENSITIZATION; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; MOUSE STRIATUM	We had previously demonstrated that opioid receptors contribute to the induction and expression of behavioral sensitization induced by repeated daily injection with 2.5 mg/kg of methamphetamine for 7 days. Using the same regimen, the present study investigated the alterations in mu-opioid receptor during the induction (on days 2, 5, and 8) and expression (on days 11 and 21) periods of behavioral sensitization. Radioligand binding revealed that the maximal binding of mu-opioid receptor was not changed on days 2 and 5, but down-regulated on day 8. After cessation of drug treatment, the maximal binding of mu-opioid receptor gradually and time-dependently returned to normal level on day 11 and up-regulated on day 21. In contrast, no changes in delta- and kappa-opioid receptors were detectable on any given day examined. The potency of DAMGO for [S-35]-GTP gamma S coupling was enhanced on days 2, 5, 11, and 21. Moreover, 1 mu M of naltrexone or beta-chlornaltrexamine significantly suppressed the basal [S-35]-GTP gamma S coupling on days 2, 11, and 21. These findings indicate enhanced responsiveness and elevated constitutive activity of mu-opioid receptor. In summary, our data clearly demonstrate that alterations in mu-opioid receptor are involved in and may contribute to the sensitization to locomotor stimulating effect of methamphetamine.

Targetting high affinity and D-3 versus D-2 receptor-preferring ligands, the partial agonist BP 897 was taken as a lead structure. Variations in the spacer and the aryl moiety led to N-alkylated 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)piperazines with markedly improved affinity and selectivity. Molecular modeling studies supported the structural development. Pharmacophore models for dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptor ligands were developed from their potentially bioactive conformation and were compared in order to get insight into molecular properties of importance for D-2/D-3 receptor selectivity. For the 72 compounds presented here, an extended and more linear conformation in the aliphatic or aryl spacers turned out to be crucial for dopamine D-3 receptor selectivity. Structural diversity in the aryl moiety (benzamides, heteroarylamides, arylimides) had a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D-3 receptor affinity, which was optimized with more rigid aryl acrylamide derivatives. Compound 38 (ST 280, (E)-4-iodo-N-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide) displayed a most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD(3)) = 0.5 nM; Ki (hD(2L)) = 76.4 nM; selectivity ratio of 153), and above that, compound 38 offered the prospect of a novel radioligand as a pharmacological tool for various D-3 receptor-related in vitro and in vivo investigation.

The synthetic procedure employed was developed in our laboratory and involved a two-step one-pot reaction that consists of the treatment of 6-aminouracil derivatives with N-bromosuccinimide to generate a 5,5-dibromo-6-imino intermediate that reacts "in situ" with pyridine, 4-methoxypyridine, 4-tert-butylpyridine, or 4-phenylpyridine to afford the corresponding 1H,3H-pyrido[2,1-f]purine-2,4-diones (2-5). Functionalization at the N-3 position in compounds 2-5 was performed by reaction with DBU and different alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, or benzyl halides. Binding studies at human adenosine A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptors revealed significant antagonist effects in the low nanomolar range, in particular against the A3 receptor. Thus, the 1-benzyl-3-propyl-1H, 3H-pyrido [2,1-f] purine-2,4-dione derivative 6, which can be considered a lead compound in this series, exhibited a K-i value of 4.0 +/- 0.3 nM against the hA(3) receptor. Because xanthine derivatives have traditionally been considered poor A(3) antagonists, the described pyrido[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione derivatives represent a new family of adenosine receptor antagonists which deserves further exploration.

The bovine CRLR has 462 amino acids and 92% homology with the human CRLR. In a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay, bovine CRLR was found to be widely distributed, including in the heart and lungs. Stable transfection of bovine CRLR in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293) resulted in specific high-affinity [I-125] rat adrenomedulin (rADM)-binding (dissociation constant = 145 +/- 15 pM). ADM-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity with an EC50 value, of 5.0 +/- 1.2 nM. The human ADM receptor antagonist hADM(22-52) inhibited [I-125]rADM-binding and ADM-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Interactions between bovine CRLR and individual receptor activity modifying proteins (RAMPs) were also investigated. Transient co-transfection of bovine CRLR cDNA with human receptor activity modifying protein 1 (hRAMP1) cDNA in HEK-293 cells resulted in the expression of a CRLR that displayed high-affinity binding to calcitonin gene-related peptide. Co--transfection of bovine CRLR with human RAMP2 or RAMP3 cDNAs in HEK-293 cells displayed high-affinity ADM receptors. These observations suggest that in the absence of exogenous RAMPs heterologous expression of bovine CRLR results in an ADM receptor phenotype. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Most angiotensin II effects are mediated via membrane bound AT(1) receptors. However, the role of myocardial AT(1) receptors in cardiac hypertrophy and contractility is still rarely defined. To address the hypothesis that increased myocardial AT(1) receptor density causes cardiac hypertrophy apart from high blood pressure we developed a transgenic rat model which expresses the human AT(1) receptor under the control of the alpha -myosin heavy-chain promoter specifically in the myocardium. Expression was identified and quantified by northern blot analysis and radioligand binding assays, demonstrating overexpression of angiotensin II receptors in the transgenic rats up to 46 times the amount seen in nontransgenic rats. Coupling of the human AT(1) receptor to rat G proteins and signal transduction cascade was verified by sensitivity to GTP-gamma -S and increased sensitivity of intracellular Ca2+ [Ca2+](i) to angiotensin II in fluo-3 loaded transgenic cardiomyocytes. Transgenic rats exhibited normal cardiac growth and function under baseline conditions. Pronounced hypertrophic growth and contractile responses to angiotensin II, however, were noted in transgenic rats challenged by volume and pressure overload. In summary, we generated a new transgenic rat model that exhibits an upregulated myocardial AT(1) receptor density and demonstrates augmented cardiac hypertrophy and contractile response to angiotensin II after volume and pressure overload, but not under baseline conditions.

Patients and methods A total of 118 patients with suspected PCa who underwent Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT between May 2015 and June 2016 were prospectively included. Final decision on performing biopsy was left to the referring urologist after considering the clinical data, scan findings and discussion with the patient. Results Overall, 51 patients were scan negative, among whom six underwent biopsy but was negative for malignancy. In 45 patients, an immediate biopsy could be avoided and put on follow-up. None of these patients were documented to have PCa in the short average follow-up of 6 months. Among 67 patients who were scan positive, 56 patients underwent transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy, and malignancy could be documented in 46 of them. In addition, comprehensive initial staging information could be obtained in them, with organ-confined disease demonstrated in 33 patients and metastatic disease in 13 patients. Conclusion Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT can act as a gate keeper in selecting patients with suspected PCa who should undergo an immediate transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy and who could be kept on active surveillance.

Building upon these considerations, we synthesized a new series of LP1 analogues by introducing naphthyl or heteroaromatic rings in propanamide side chain of its N-substituent (9-15). In vitro competition-binding assays in HEK293 cells stably expressing MOR, DOR or KOR showed that in compound 9 the 1-naphthyl ring led to the retention of MOR affinity (K-i(MOR) = 38 +/- 4 nM) displaying good selectivity versus DOR and KOR. In the electrically stimulated GPI, compound 9 was inactive as agonist but produced an antagonist potency value (pA(2)) of 8.6 in presence of MOR agonist DAMGO. Moreover, subcutaneously administered it antagonized the antinociceptive effects of morphine with an AD(50) = 2.0 mg/kg in mouse-tail flick test. Modeling studies on MOR revealed that compound 9 fit very well in the binding pocket but in a different way in respect to the agonist LP1. Probably the replacement of its N-substituent on the III, IV and V TM domains reflects an antagonist behavior. Therefore, compound 9 could represent a potential lead to further develop antagonists as valid therapeutic agents and useful pharmacological tools to study opioid receptor function.

In the quinpirole sensitization rat model of OCD, compulsive checking is induced by chronic treatment with the DA agonist quinpirole, and is attenuated by the 5-HT agonist drug mCPP. However, mCPP has affinity for a number of 5-HT receptor subtypes, and it is unknown by which receptors mCPP exerts its effects on quinpirole-treated animals. The present study tested in rats whether mCPP activity at 5-HT2A/C receptors mediates the attenuation of compulsive checking in quinpirole-treated animals. Rats were chronically treated with quinpirole on the open field for the induction of compulsive checking. Following the induction phase, animals were treated with mCPP (1.25 mg/kg) and the selective 5-HT2A/C receptor antagonist ritanserin (1 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg) to test whether blockade of 5-HT2A/C receptors inhibits attenuation of checking by mCPP. Results showed that as expected, quinpirole induced compulsive checking, and mCPP reduced its performance. However, 5-HT2A/C receptor blockade by ritanserin did not inhibit the attenuation of compulsive checking by mCPP. These results suggest that the reduction in compulsive checking by mCPP is not mediated by activity at 5-HT2A/C receptors, but by another receptor subtype. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A bivalent ligand 1 with a 21-atom spacer was thus synthesized and explicitly characterized as a novel pharmacological probe to study the underlying mechanism of opioid-enhanced NeuroAIDS. The steric hindrance generated from the spacer affected the binding affinity and Ca2+ flux inhibition functional activity of bivalent ligand 1 at the chemokine receptor CCR5 more profoundly than it did at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, the CCR5 radioligand binding affinity and the Ca2+ flux inhibition function of the ligand seemed not necessarily to correlate with its antiviral activity given that it was at least two times more potent than maraviroc alone in reducing Tat expression upon HIV-1 infection in human astrocytes. Furthermore, the ligand was also about two times more potent than the simple mixture of maraviroc and naltrexone in the same viral entry inhibition assay. Therefore bivalent ligand 1 seemed to function more effectively by targeting specifically the putative MOR-CCR5 heterodimer in the viral invasion process. The results reported here suggest that a properly designed bivalent ligand may serve as a useful chemical probe to study the potential MOR-CCR5 interaction during the progression of NeuroAIDS.

Our aim was to measure CB1 levels in brains of PD patients in vivo and to investigate the relation between CB1 availability and LID. We studied 12 healthy controls and 29 PD patients (9 drug-naive patients with early PD, 10 patients with advanced PD and LID, and 10 patients with advanced PD without LID). PD patients were examined using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and the modified Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (mAIMS). All subjects underwent positron emission tomography (PET) with the CB1-selective radioligand [F-18] MK-9470 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). PD patients showed an absolute decrease in CB1 availability in the substantia nigra. By contrast, CB1 availability was relatively increased in nigrostriatal, mesolimbic, and mesocortical dopaminergic projection areas. CB1 availability did not differ significantly between advanced PD patients with and without LID. Within the group of PD patients with LID, there was no significant correlation between CB1 availability and LID severity. These data demonstrate regional changes in CB1 availability in PD in vivo, but do not support a role for dysregulation of CB1 levels in the pathogenesis of LID. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Direct Regulation of Androgen Receptor Activity by Potent CYP17 Inhibitors in Prostate Cancer Cells	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							I CLINICAL-TRIAL; ABIRATERONE ACETATE; ANTITUMOR-ACTIVITY; DOWN-REGULATION; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; GENE; PROGRESSION; INDUCTION; DOCETAXEL	TOK-001 and abiraterone are potent 17-heteroarylsteroid (17-HAS) inhibitors of Cyp17, one of the rate-limiting enzymes in the biosynthesis of testosterone from cholesterol in prostate cancer cells. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism underlying the prevention of prostate cell growth by 17-HASs still remains elusive. Here, we assess the effects of 17-HASs on androgen receptor (AR) activity in LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells. We demonstrate that both TOK-001 and abiraterone reduced AR protein and mRNA expression, and antagonized AR-dependent promoter activation induced by androgen. TOK-001, but not abiraterone, is an effective apparent competitor of the radioligand [H-3]R1881 for binding to the wild type and various mutant AR (W741C, W741L) proteins. In agreement with these data, TOK-001 is a consistently superior inhibitor than abiraterone of R1881-induced transcriptional activity of both wild type and mutant AR. However, neither agent was able to trans-activate the AR in the absence of R1881. Our data demonstrate that phospho-4EBP1 levels are significantly reduced by TOK-001 and to a lesser extent by abiraterone alcohol, and suggest a mechanism by which cap-dependent translation is suppressed by blocking assembly of the eIF4F and eIF4G complex to the mRNA 5' cap. Thus, the effects of these 17-HASs on AR signaling are complex, ranging from a decrease in testosterone production through the inhibition of Cyp17 as previously described, to directly reducing both AR protein expression and R1881-induced AR trans-activation.

Therefore, N-[3,5-dichloro-2-(methoxy) phenyl]-4-(methoxy)-3-(1-piperazinyl) benzenesulfonamide (SB399885), a selective and high affinity (pK(i) = 9.11) 5-HT6 antagonist, has been radiolabeled with carbon-11 by O-methylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue with [C-11]MeOTf in order to determine the suitability of [C-11]SB399885 to quantify 5-HT6R in living brain using PET. Desmethyl-SB399885 was prepared, starting from 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine hydrochloride, in excellent yield. The yield obtained for radiolabeling of [C-11]SB399885 was 30 +/- 5% (EOS) and the total synthesis time was 30 min at EOB. PET studies with [C-11]SB399885 in baboon showed fast uptake followed by rapid clearance in the brain. Highest uptake of radioactivity of [C-11]SB399885 in baboon brain were found in temporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, pareital cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus. Poor brain entry and inconsistent brain uptake of [C-11]SB399885 compared to known 5-HT6R distribution limits its usefulness for the in vivo quantification of 5-HT6R with PET. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Animal experiments have demonstrated that brain stimulation is able to induce significant dopaminergic changes in extrastriatal areas. Given the up-growing interest of non-invasive brain stimulation as potential tool for treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders, it would be critical to investigate dopaminergic functional interactions in the prefrontal cortex and more in particular the effect of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (areas 9/46) stimulation on prefrontal dopamine (DA). Methodology/Principal Findings: Healthy volunteers were studied with a high-affinity DA D2-receptor radioligand, [C-11] FLB 457-PET following 10 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the left and right DLPFC. rTMS on the left DLPFC induced a significant reduction in [C-11] FLB 457 binding potential (BP) in the ipsilateral subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (BA 25/12), pregenual ACC (BA 32) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (BA 11). There were no significant changes in [C-11] FLB 457 BP following right DLPFC rTMS. Conclusions/Significance: To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide evidence of extrastriatal DA modulation following acute rTMS of DLPFC with its effect limited to the specific areas of medial prefrontal cortex. [C-11] FLB 457-PET combined with rTMS may allow to explore the neurochemical functions of specific cortical neural networks and help to identify the neurobiological effects of TMS for the treatment of different neurological and psychiatric diseases.

In this study, the effects of a series of alkylene-linked tacrine dimers on GABAA receptors were examined. In radioligand binding assay, the analogues differed in binding affinity for GABAA receptors, and potency monotonically increased as the tether was shortened from nine to two methylenes. Bis(2)-tacrine, the shortest tacrine dimer, could displace [H-3]muscimol from rat brain membranes with an IC50 of 0.48 M, which was 11, 13 and 525 times more potent than the GABAA receptor antagonist (+)-bicucul line, bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine, respectively. In whole-cell patch-clamp recordings, these dimeric tacrine analogues competitively antagonized GABA-induced inward current with a rank order of potency of bis(2)-tacrine > bicuculline > bis(7)-tacrine > bis(9)-tacrine > tacrine, and the potency of bis(2)-tacrine was 11, 18 and 487 times higher than that of (+)bicuculline, bis(7)-tacrine and tacrine, respectively. Bis(2)-tacrine shifted the GABA concentration-response curve to the right in a parallel manner, and the inhibition was voltage-independent between -80 and +20 mV. It can be concluded that the shorter the alkylene linkage in tacrine dimers the stronger the binding affinity and higher the antagonistic effect on the GABAA receptor will be. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Interaction of NPY compounds with the rat glucocorticoid-induced receptor (GIR) reveals similarity to the NPY-Y<sub>2</sub> receptor	PEPTIDES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International NPY Meeting	APR 22-26, 2006	St Petersburg, FL			glucocorticoid-induced receptor (GIR); NPY; Y-2 receptor; NPY3-36	NEUROPEPTIDE-Y RECEPTOR; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MOLECULAR-CLONING; MESSENGER-RNA; Y-1 RECEPTOR; BRAIN; BINDING; GENES; MOUSE; SYSTEM	The rat glucocorticoid-induced receptor (rGIR) is an orphan G protein-coupled receptor awaiting pharmacological characterization. Among known receptors, rGIR exhibits highest sequence similarity to the neuropeptide Y (NPY)-Y-2 receptor (38-40%). The pharmacological profile of rGIR was investigated using I-125-PYY3-36, a Y-2-preferring radioligand and several NPY analogs. rGIR displayed a similar displacement profile as reported for the Y-2 receptor, in that the Y-2-selective C terminus fragments of NPY and PYY (NPY3-36, and PYY3-36) showed high affinity binding and activation of rGIR (low nanomolar range). The rank order potency for displacement was NPY3-36 > PYY3-36=NPY > NPY13-36 > Ac, Leu NPY24-36 >[D-Trp(32)]-NPY > Leu(31), Pro(34)-NPY=hPP. NPY and Y-2-selective agonists NPY3-36 and PYY3-36 led to significant activation of S-35-GTP gamma S binding to rGIR transfected cells. BIIE0246, a specific Y-2 antagonist, displaced I-125-PYY3-36 binding to rGIR with high affinity (95 nM). Activation of S-35-GTP gamma S binding by Y-2-selective agonist in rGIR transfected cells was also completely abolished by BIIE0246. Our data report, for the first time, an interaction of NPY ligands with rGIR expressed in vitro, and indicate similarities between GIR and the NPY-Y-2 receptor. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Mechanical circulatory support by ventricular assist devices (VAD) is used to bridge patients to heart transplantation. Mechanical unloading by VAD may induce reverse remodeling in heart transplantation (HTx) candidates. However, little is known on beta-adrenergic receptor subtype regulation and adrenergic signal transduction under VAD-support. We investigated paired myocardial samples from 16 VAD-supported patients and 9 non-failing donor hearts. We analyzed beta-adrenergic receptor subtype regulation by real-time PCR and radioligand binding and cardiac troponin I phosphorylation (by phospho-cTnI-specific antibodies). We found that the beta 1-adrenergic receptor (LIAR) is downregulated at VAD-implantation on mRNA and protein levels whereas the beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta 2AR) was not. After VAD-support, beta 1AR protein but not its mRNA was upregulated, whereas the degree of cTnI-phosphorylation was reduced. Upregulation of beta 1AR was enhanced by beta blocking medication during VAD-support. However, in 9 out of 15 patients, beta 1AR-density remained below the 0.25 percentile of donor hearts. VAD-support is associated with partial normalization of the beta AR-signal transduction pathways. This beneficial effect is related to a posttranscriptional increase in beta 1AR-density.

To probe structural requirements for folate receptor targeting with low molecular weight radiometal chelates, specifically the role of the amino acid fragment of folic acid (pteroylglutamic acid) in mediating targeting selectivity, the amide-linked conjugate pteroyl-NHCH2CH2OCH2CH2OCH2CH2NH-DTPA was prepared by a three-step procedure from pteroic acid, 2,2'-(ethylenedioxy)-bis(ethylamine),and t-Bu-protected DTPA. This conjugate, 1-{2-[2-[(2-(biscarboxymethyl-amino)ethyl)-carboxymethyl-amino]ethyl]-carboxymethyl-amino}-acetylamino-3,6-dioxa-8-pteroylamino-octane (1), was employed for synthesis of the corresponding In-111(III) radiopharmaceutical. Following intravenous administration to athymic mice, the In-111 complex of 1 was found to selectively localize in folate receptor-positive human KB tumor xenografts and to afford prolonged tumor retention of the In-111 radiolabel (5.4 +/- 0.8, 5.6 +/- 1.1, and 3.6 +/- 0.6% of the injected dose per gram of tumor at 1, 4, and 24 h, respectively). The observed tumor localization was effectively blocked by co-administration of folic acid with the In-111-1 complex, consistent with a folate receptor-mediated targeting process. In control studies, tumor targeting with this pteroic acid conjugate appears as effective as that seen using In-111-DTPA-folate, a radiopharmaceutical that has progressed to clinical trials for detection of folate receptor-expressing gynecological tumors.

To characterize inverse agonist binding, we synthesized a high specific activity radioligand from this series, [H-3]LY515300 (3-[1-((3-cyclohexyl-[3,4-(3) H-2])-3 (R,S)-hydroxypropyl)-3 (R),4(R)-dimethylpiperidin-4-yl]phenol). In membranes expressing cloned human opioid receptors, [H-3]LY515300 binding was saturable and exhibited low nonspecific binding. [H-3]LY515300 bound with high affinity to the mu(K-d = 0.07 nM), delta- (K-d = 0.92 nM) and kappa-(K-d = 0.45 nM) opioid receptors. High affinity [H-3]LY515300 binding to all opioid receptors was Na+-dependent, a characteristic of inverse agonists. Displacement by standard opioid compounds yielded K-i values consistent with their known opioid receptor affinities. Autoradiographic localization of specific [H-3]LY515300 binding in rat and guinea pig brain was high in areas known to express high levels of opioid (particularly mu-opioid receptor) binding sites including the caudate, nucleus accumbens, and nucleus tractus solitarius. Thus, [H-3]LY515300 is the first radiolabeled opioid receptor inverse agonist useful for the study of opioid receptors in cell lines and native tissues. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, we further characterize its pharmacological activity as well as its structure-activity relationships. In the isolated rat vas deferens, rho-TIA inhibited alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration that were triggered by norepinephrine, but did not affect presynaptic alpha(2)-adrenoreceptor-mediated responses. In radioligand binding assays using [I-125] HEAT, rho-TIA displayed slightly greater potency at the alpha(1B) than at the alpha(1A) or alpha(1D) subtypes. Moreover, although it did not affect the rate of association for [H-3] prazosin binding to the alpha(1B)-adrenoreceptor, the dissociation rate was increased, indicating non-competitive antagonism by rho-TIA. N- terminally truncated analogs of rho-TIA were less active than the full-length peptide, with a large decline in activity observed upon removal of the fourth residue of rho-TIA (Arg(4)). An alanine walk of rho-TIA confirmed the importance of Arg(4) for activity and revealed a number of other residues clustered around Arg(4) that contribute to the potency of rho-TIA. The unique allosteric antagonism of rho-TIA resulting from its interaction with receptor residues that constitute a binding site that is distinct from that of the classical competitive alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonists may allow the development of inhibitors that are highly subtype selective.

Accordingly, the internalization and down-regulation properties of mutated receptors with defects in G protein coupling and second messenger generation were investigated. The Delta12 and Delta5 receptors, previously shown to be defective in G protein coupling, exhibited greater agonist-induced losses of cell surface accessibility assessed by radioligand binding to intact cells on ice than for the wild-type receptor; however, these receptors were completely defective in endocytosis into intracellular vesicles assessed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. These receptors also did not undergo down-regulation with long-term agonist exposure as did the wild-type receptor; instead, a prominent up-regulation was observed. The Y348A receptor, previously shown to be defective in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and endocytosis was also defective in down-regulation but did not exhibit significant up-regulation. In contrast, a receptor construct with amino acid residues 246 to 261 deleted (Delta[246-261]) was also defective in stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis but exhibited internalization and down-regulation properties essentially identical to those for the wild-type receptor. Together, these results suggest that stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis by alpha(1B)-adrenergic receptors is not required for their endocytosis or down-regulation but that similar and overlapping receptor structural domains are involved in mediating these processes.

Background: Alterations in striatal D2-like dopamine receptors in PD have been extensively demonstrated using PET, but there are no studies focusing on extrastriatal D2/3Rs. Methods: Fourteen unmedicated patients with idiopathic early PD with predominantly left-sided symptoms, 14 levodopa-medicated patients with advanced PD, and 20 normal age-matched controls were examined using PET. PET scanning was performed with a novel high-affinity D2/3R radioligand ([C-11]FLB 457) and a PET scanner in three-dimensional mode. Results: In advanced PD, the binding potential of [11C]FLB 457 in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was decreased by 40% (p < 0.01), in the anterior cingulate cortex by 20% (p < 0.01), and in the medial thalamus by 17% (p < 0.05) compared with healthy controls. In early PD, the extrastriatal [11C]FLB 457 binding potentials were not significantly different compared with the control group. However, the binding potential in the anterior cingulate cortex (29%; p < 0.05) was higher in early PD compared with advanced PD. Conclusions: These results imply that the D2/3 receptor subtypes outside the striatum are affected in advanced PD but not in the early stages of the disease, and that this receptor decline is present in the anterior cingulate cortex, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the thalamus.

Methods-The presence of LKM1 in the plasma membrane was investigated by indirect immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy of isolated rat hepatocytes probed with 10 LKM1 positive sera (five from patients with AIM and five from patients with chronic MCV infection) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-CYP2D6 serum. Results-Serum from both types of patient stained the plasma membrane of non-permeabilised cells, where the fluorescent signal could be visualised as discrete clumps. Conversely, permeabilised hepatocytes showed diffuse submembranous/cytoplasmic staining. Adsorption with recombinant CYP2D6 substantially reduced plasma membrane staining and LKM1 immunoblot reactivity. Plasma membrane staining of LKM1 colocalised with that of anti-CYP2D6. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that a single 50 kDa protein recognised by anti-CYP2D6 can be isolated from the plasma membrane of intact hepatocytes. Conclusions-AIH and MCV related LKM1 recognise CYP2D6 exposed on the plasma membrane of isolated hepatocytes. This observation supports the notion that anti-CYP2D6 autoreactivity may be involved in the pathogenesis of liver damage.

In the current study, mice pain models including hot plate, acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin tests were conducted to evaluate the antinociceptive actions of Cepharanthine. [H-3]-ligand competitive binding assay was applied to determine the binding affinity and selectivity of Cepharanthine at kappa, mu and delta opioid receptors. Cepharanthine-induced constipation was investigated using the small intestinal transit test. The results showed that intraperitoneal injection of Cepharanthine produced potent antinociception with an ED50 value of 24.5 mg/kg in the acetic acid-induced writhing test. In the formalin test, Cepharanthine produced moderate antinociception with the maximum analgesic activity of 42.6 +/- 11.3% in phase I and 60.1 +/- 7.7% in phase II, respectively. Cepharanthine had no effects in the hot plate test. In vitro radioligand binding assay, Cepharanthine exhibited a high affinity for mu opioid receptors with a Ki value of 80 nM, without binding to kappa and delta opioid receptors. Correspondingly, Cepharanthine-mediated antinociceptive effects were antagonized by pretreatment with opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. Cepharanthine also decreased the small intestine propulsion rates in the small intestinal transit test. Together, this study firstly demonstrates that Cepharanthine produces potent antinociception in acetic acid-induced visceral pain and moderate antinociception in formalin-induced inflammatory pain, and its mechanism of action may be through activation of mu opioid receptors.

Considering that the selective release of drugs in cancer cells is of high relevance, we were encouraged to develop cleavable, self-immolative GnRH-III-drug conjugates which consist of a p-aminobenzyloxycarbonlyl (PABC) spacer between a cathepsin B-cleavable dipeptide (Val-Ala, Val-Cit) and the classical anticancer drugs daunorubicin (Dau) and paclitaxel (PTX). Alongside these compounds, non-cleavable GnRH-III-drug conjugates were also synthesized, and all compounds were analyzed for their antiproliferative activity. The cleavable GnRH-III bioconjugates revealed a growth inhibitory effect on GnRH receptor-expressing A2780 ovarian cancer cells, while their activity was reduced on Panc-1 pancreatic cancer cells exhibiting a lower GnRH receptor level. Moreover, the antiproliferative activity of the non-cleavable counterparts was strongly reduced. Additionally, the efficient cleavage of the Val-Ala linker and the subsequent release of the drugs could be verified by lysosomal degradation studies, while radioligand binding studies ensured that the GnRH-III-drug conjugates bound to the GnRH receptor with high affinity. Our results underline the high value of GnRH-III-based homing devices and the application of cathepsin B-cleavable linker systems for the development of small molecule drug conjugates (SMDCs).

Here, our efforts were focused on the synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of the lead LP1, a multitarget opioid analgesic compound featuring an N-phenylpropanamido substituent. LP1 derivatives 5a-d and 6a-d were characterized by flexible groups at the N-substituent that allow them to reposition themselves relative to cis-(-)-N-normetazocine nucleus, thus producing different pharmacological profiles at the mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors (MOR, DOR and KOR) in in vitro and in vivo assays. Among the series, compound 5c, with the best in vitro and in vivo profile, resulted a MOR agonist which displays a K-i(MOR) of 6.1 nM in a competitive binding assay, and an IC50 value of 11.5 nM and an I-max of 72% in measurement of cAMP accumulation in HEK293 cells stably expressing MOR, with a slight lower efficacy than LP1. Moreover, in a mouse model of acute thermal nociception, compound 5c, intraperitoneally administered, exhibits naloxone-reversed antinociceptive properties with an ED50 of 4.33 mg/kg. These results expand our understanding of the importance of N-substituent structural variations in the opioid receptor profile of cis-(-)-N-normetazocine derivatives and identify a new MOR agonist useful for the development of novel opioid analgesics for pain treatment.

We report here in vitro binding affinity studies, and in vivo pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies of the recombinant mAb. The overall aim was to characterize the recombinant antibody from each of the three highest producing transfected clones and to select one to establish a master cell bank. In mAb pharmacokinetic studies, after injection with h2E2 (120 mg/kg iv) blood was collected from the tail tip of mice over 28 days. Antibody concentrations were quantified using ELISA. The h2E2 concentration as a function of time was fit using a two-compartment pharmacokinetic model. To test in vivo efficacy, mice were injected with h2E2 (120 mg/kg iv), then one hour later injected with an equimolar dose of cocaine. Blood and brain were collected 5 min after cocaine administration. Cocaine concentrations were quantified using LC/MS. The affinity of the antibody for cocaine was determined using a [H-3] cocaine binding assay. All three antibodies had long elimination half-lives, 2-5 nM Kd for cocaine, and prevented cocaine's entry into the brain by sequestering it in the plasma. Pharmacokinetic and radioligand binding assays supported designation of the highest producing clone 85 as the master cell bank candidate. Overall, the recombinant h2E2 showed favorable binding properties, pharmacokinetics, and in vivo efficacy. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

To further improve peripheral selectivity of this highly potent ligand, its pyridal ring was quaterinized with benzyl bromide to produce BNAP. In radioligand binding assay, the K-i of BNAP for MOR was 0.76 +/- 0.09 nM and was >900-fold more selective for MOR than DOR The K-i for KOR was 3.46 +/- 0.05 nM. In [S-35]GTP gamma S ligand stimulated assay, BNAP showed low agonist efficacy with 14.6% of the maximum response of DAMGO with an EC50 of 4.84 +/- 0.6 nM. However, unlike its parent compound NAP, BNAP displayed partial agonist activity at KOR with % maximum response at 45.9 +/- 1.7% of U50,488H. BNAP did not reverse morphine-induced antinociception when administered subcutaneously but did antagonize when administered intracerebroventricularly. BNAP antagonized morphine-induced contractions of the circular muscle in mice colon. BNAP inhibition of field-stimulated contractions in longitudinal muscle strips for the guinea-pig ileum were also blocked by nor-BNI, a kappa opioid receptor antagonist. BNAP induced inhibition of acetic acid induced abdominal stretching in chronic morphine treated mice. These findings suggest that BNAP is a dual MOR antagonist/KOR agonist and may have functional use in irritable bowel patients.

However, the widely used current ZnT8A radioligand binding assay (RBA) has proved to be difficult for many laboratories to implement. The aim of this study was the development and characterization of the performance of a novel fluid-phase ZnT8A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in relation to standard RBA in type 1 diabetes. Sera from 114 patients with type 1 diabetes and 140 blinded Islet Autoantibody Standardization Program (IASP2012) samples were studied. The sensitivity of ELISA-ZnT8A is equivalent to or slightly higher than that of conventional RBA with similar specificity. Furthermore, the median SD score using this ELISA was significantly higher than that obtained with RBA (P < 0.0001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that ELISA-ZnT8A positivity was associated with younger age of onset (a parts per thousand currency sign20 years; OR 15.91, P = 0.0002), acute-onset form of type 1 diabetes (OR 3.38, P = 0.019), and the presence of IA-2 autoantibodies (OR 3.75, P = 0.014). Furthermore, the levels of ELISA-ZnT8A were associated with the reactivity to ZnT8-325Arg, but not ZnT8-325Trp. We conclude that this nonradioactive bivalent ZnT8A assay has high performance and should facilitate large-scale autoantibody screening. Moreover, these results suggest that the humoral autoimmunity against ZnT8 is related to a high risk of faster development of type 1 diabetes and the ZnT8A levels are associated with the known aa325 variants.

Novel proteins associated with human dilated cardiomyopathy: selective reduction in α<sub>1A</sub>-adrenergic receptors and increased desensitization proteins	JOURNAL OF RECEPTORS AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION			English	Article						Adrenergic; alpha1; desensitization; heart failure; proteomics; receptor	FAILING HUMAN-HEART; 2-DIMENSIONAL GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; CARDIAC-HYPERTROPHY; GENE-EXPRESSION; TROPONIN-I; ALPHA-1-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; BETA-1-ADRENERGIC RECEPTORS; PULMONARY-HYPERTENSION; ALPHA-ADRENORECEPTOR	Therapeutics to treat human heart failure (HF) and the identification of proteins associated with HF are still limited. We analyzed alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes in human HF and performed proteomic analysis on more uniform samples to identify novel proteins associated with human HF. Six failing hearts with end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and four non-failing heart controls were subjected to proteomic analysis. Out of 48 identified proteins, 26 proteins were redundant between samples. Ten of these 26 proteins were previously reported to be associated with HF. Of the newly identified proteins, we found several muscle proteins and mitochondrial/electron transport proteins, while novel were functionally similar to previous reports. However, we also found novel proteins involved in functional classes such as beta-oxidation and G-protein coupled receptor signaling and desensitization not previously associated with HF. We also performed radioligand-binding studies on the heart samples and not only confirmed a large loss of beta(1)-ARs in end-stage DCM, but also found a selective decrease in the alpha(1A)-AR subtype not previously reported. We have identified new proteins and functional categories associated with end-stage DCM. We also report that similar to the previously characterized loss of beta(1)-AR in HF, there is also a concomitant loss of alpha(1A)-ARs, which are considered cardioprotective proteins.

Adolescent male rats are less sensitive than adults to the anxiogenic and serotonin-releasing effects of fenfluramine	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adolescence; Serotonin; Anxiety; Microdialysis	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; ELEVATED PLUS-MAZE; TRYPTOPHAN-HYDROXYLASE-ACTIVITY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; IN-VIVO MICRODIALYSIS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS-SEPTI; RECEPTOR MESSENGER-RNA; LOW CSF 5-HIAA; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; INTRAVENOUS COCAINE	Risk taking behavior increases during adolescence, which is also a critical period for the onset of drug abuse. The central serotonergic system matures during the adolescent period, and its immaturity during early adolescence may contribute to adolescent risk taking, as deficits in central serotonergic function have been associated with impulsivity, aggression, and risk taking. We investigated serotonergic modulation of behavior and presynaptic serotonergic function in adult (67-74 days old) and adolescent (28-34 days old) male rats. Fenfluramine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) produced greater anxiogenic effects in adult rats in both the light/dark and elevated plus maze tests for anxiety-like behavior, and stimulated greater increases in extracellular serotonin in the adult medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (1, 2.5, and 10 mg/kg, i.p.). Local infusion of 100 mM potassium chloride into the mPFC also stimulated greater serotonin efflux in adult rats. Adult rats had higher tissue serotonin content than adolescents in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus, but the rate of serotonin synthesis was similar between age groups. Serotonin transporter (SERT) immunoreactivity and SERT radioligand binding were comparable between age groups in all three brain regions. These data suggest that lower tissue serotonin stores in adolescents limit fenfluramine-stimulated serotonin release and so contribute to the lesser anxiogenic effects of fenfluramine.

Here, we investigate whether adenine sulfate can preserve cardiac function and the cholinergic system against MI. Rats were treated with adenine sulfate for three weeks after coronary ligation. Cardiac function was assessed by hemodynamics. The muscarinic M-2 receptor and cholinesterase-positive nerves were semi-quantified by immunochemical and histochemical staining. The maximal binding capacity (B-max) of muscarinic receptors, determined by radioligand binding assay, showed that cardiac function was impaired in MI rats. Adenine sulfate reversed MI-induced reduction of mean artery pressure and left ventricular systolic pressure and elevation of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Moreover, adenine sulfate also increased nitric oxide (NO) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity. The amelioration was accompanied by a reversal of the infarction-induced reduction of cholinesterase-positive nerves and M-2-receptor expression and B-max in the adenine sulfate high dose group. Meanwhile, adenine :sulfate treatment corrected the disorder of cardiac redox state by reduction in maleic dialdehyde and increase in superoxide dismutase. In conclusion, adenine sulfate exerts cardioprotection against Ml and ameliorates NO production. Changes in cardiac vagal distribution density and M-2-receptor expression raise the possibility that improvement of the cardiac cholinergic system is involved in adenine sulfate-induced cardioprotective effects.

We now report the mechanistic basis for the complex behaviors noted for 2A3BTs at A(1) receptors. Using a combination of membrane-based and intact-cell radioligand binding, multiple signaling assays, and a native tissue bioassay, we found that the allosteric interaction between 2A3BTs and the agonists 2-chloro-N-6-[H-3]cyclopentyladenosine or (-)-N-6-(2-phenylisopropyl)adenosine (R-PIA) or the antagonist [H-3]8cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine is consistent with a ternary complex model involving recognition of a single extracellular allosteric site. However, when allowed access to the intracellular milieu, 2A3BTs have a secondary action as direct G protein inhibitors; this latter property is receptor-independent as it is observed in nontransfected cells and also after stimulation of another GPCR. In addition, we found that 2A3BTs can signal as allosteric agonists in their own right but show bias toward certain pathways relative to the orthosteric agonist, R-PIA. These results indicate that 2A3BTs have a dual mode of action when interacting with the A(1) receptor and that they can engender novel functional selectivity in A(1) signaling. These mechanisms need to be factored into allosteric ligand structure-activity studies.

[H-3]-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB, a hydrophobic ligand) specifically bound to mAChRs in the cortex segments. The total mAChRs level was approximately 2,000 fmol/mg protein, which was estimated after incubation for 120 min at 37 degrees C or for 8 h at 4 degrees C. These mAChRs were a mixture of high- and low-affinity sites for N-methylscopolamine (NMS) in a 70:30 ratio. In contrast, only a single high-affinity site for NMS was detected following incubation for 30 min at 37 degrees C, whose abundance was about 70% of that of the total mAChRs. Atropine showed a single affinity for mAChRs under all conditions. These indicate that mAChRs are constitutively expressed not only on plasma membrane sites but also at intracellular sites in rat cerebral cortex and that the receptors at both sites have different affinities for NMS. Acetylcholine completely inhibited [H-3]-QNB binding to both mAChRs without any change in the subcellular distribution, suggesting the possibility that acetylcholine can access, and bind to, both mAChRs in intact tissue. Two different affinity states for acetylcholine were detected only in plasma membrane mAChRs at 37 degrees C. The present study demonstrates a unique subcellular distribution, and distinct pharmacological profiles, of mAChRs in rat cerebral cortex.

At present, no specific pharmacological therapy has been developed for XNDI, primarily due to the lack of suitable animal models. To develop what we believe to be the first viable animal model of XNDI, we generated mice in which the V2R gene could be conditionally deleted during adulthood by administration of 4-OH-tamoxifen. Radioligand-binding studies confirmed the lack of V2R-binding sites in kidneys following 4-OH-tamoxifen treatment, and further analysis indicated that upon V2R deletion, adult mice displayed all characteristic symptoms of XNDI, including polyuria, polydipsia, and resistance to the antidiuretic actions of vasopressin. Gene expression analysis suggested that activation of renal EP4 PGE(2) receptors might compensate for the lack of renal V2R activity in XNDI mice. Strikingly, both acute and chronic treatment of the mutant mice with a selective EP4 receptor agonist greatly reduced all major manifestations of XNDI, including changes in renal morphology. These physiological improvements were most likely due to a direct action on EP4 receptors expressed on collecting duct cells. These findings illustrate the usefulness of the newly generated V2R mutant mice for elucidating and testing new strategies for the potential treatment of humans with XNDI.

Alterations in NMDA receptor subunit densities and ligand binding to glycine recognition sites are associated with chronic anxiety in Alzheimer's disease	NEUROBIOLOGY OF AGING			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; glutamate receptors; glycine; neocortex; anxiety	D-ASPARTATE RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; CHANNEL COMPLEX; NR1 SUBUNIT; AMINO-ACIDS; CORTEX; EXPRESSION	Glutamatergic deficits are established neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are known to correlate with cognitive impairments. In contrast, the role of glutamatergic alterations in behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) is unclear. There is considerable preclinical evidence for the importance of glycine recognition sites (GlyRS) of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the regulation of anxiety behaviors. This study aimed to correlate several glutamatergic measures with chronic anxiety in AD. Twenty-one AD patients assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were divided into low anxiety (LA) and high anxiety (HA) subgroups. GlyRS and NMDA channel were Measured by brain homogenate binding, with [H-3]MDL 105,519 and [H-3]MK-801. respectively. Densities of NMDA receptor NR2A. NR2B and alternate spliced NR1 Subunits were quantified by immunoblotting. We found that the binding affinity to GlyRS was significantly higher in HA compared to LA, and this higher GlyRS affinity correlated with selective reduction of NR2A density as well as with elevated anxiety scores. Our observations suggest a novel mechanism whereby Subunit Specific changes in the NMDA receptor complex may be linked to chronic anxiety in AD via effects on GlyRS function. We propose that NR2A and GlyRS should be further assessed as novel targets of behavioral pharmacotherapy in AD. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Tsang, Shirley W. Y.; Lai, Mitchell K.

(AV). To evaluate biochemical changes, we used a high-performance liquid chromatography system to examine the effects of short-term (2 weeks) and long-term (8 weeks) administration of imipramine (15 mg/kg po) and an AV-extract (15, 60 and 250 mg/kg) on regional levels of serotonin (5-HT), norepinephrine (NE), dopamine (DA) and their metabolites in the rat hypothalamus, striatum and hippocampus. Pronounced changes in 5-HT, NE and DA levels were detected mainly after 8 weeks of daily imipramine treatment. Similar to imipramine, AV-extract reduced NE and DA concentrations after 8 weeks, whereas it failed to affect 5-HT levels. We speculate that the decrease in NE levels after chronic AV treatment might be based partly on the subsensitivity of presynaptic alpha(2)-receptors. In addition to the determination of central monoamine concentrations, quantitative radioligand receptor-binding studies were used to examine the effects of long-term administration of imipramine and AV-extract on beta-adrenergic binding in rat frontal cortex. [I-125]CYP binding to beta-adrenergic receptors was found to be decreased after 8 weeks treatment with imipramine, whereas AV-extract had no effect on beta-receptor binding.

The AR binding properties of sixty-five nonsteroidal compounds were assessed by a radioligand competitive binding assay with the use of cytosolic AR prepared from rat prostates. The AR agonist and antagonist activities of high-affinity ligands were determined by the ability of the ligand to regulate AR-mediated transcriptional activation in cultured CV-1 cells, using a cotransfection assay. Nonsteroidal compounds with diverse structural features demonstrated a wide range of binding affinity for the AR. Ten compounds, mainly from the bicalutamide-related series, showed a binding affinity superior to the structural pharmacophore from which they were derived. Several SARs regarding nonsteroidal AR binding were revealed from the binding data, including stereoisomeric conformation, steric effect, and electronic effect. The functional activity of high-affinity ligands ranged from antagonist to full agonist for the AR. Several structural features were found to be determinative of agonist and antagonist activities. The nonsteroidal AR agonists identified from the present studies provided a pool of candidates for further development of selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) for androgen therapy. Also, these studies uncovered or confirmed numerous important SARs governing AR binding and functional properties by nonsteroidal molecules, which would be valuable in the future structural optimization of SARMs.	Ohio State Univ, Coll Pharm, Div Pharmaceut & Pharmaceut Chem, Columbus, OH 43210 USA; Univ Tennessee, Coll Pharm, Dept Pharmaceut Sci, Memphis, TN USA	University System of Ohio; Ohio State University; University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Health Science Center	Dalton, JT (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Coll Pharm, Div Pharmaceut & Pharmaceut Chem, 500 W 12th Ave,LM Parks Hall,Room 242, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.

The parameters studied include the influence of the leaving group in the ortho position of the phenyl ring (-Cl, -Br, -1), the quantity of precursor used, the type of activation (conventional heating or microwave irradiations), the solvent, the temperature and the reaction time. The iodo-precursor was completely unreactive and the bromo-precursor gave only low incorporation (< 10%) in the optimal conditions used (conventional heating at 145degreesC or microwave activation, 100 W for 120 s). Only the chloro-precursor was found reactive in the conditions described above and up to 70% yield was observed for the formation of ortho-[18 F]fluoronitrobenzene ([F-18]-1). In all the experiments, the unwanted ortho-[18F]fluoro-halobenzenes, potentially resulting from the nitro-to-fluoro substitution, could not be detected. These results will be applied for the radiosynthesis of 5-[F-18]fluoro-nitroquipazine, a potent radioligand for the imaging of the serotonin transporter with PET.

Previously, we reported [I-125]IMSB and [I-125]ISB as excellent probes for Abeta plaque labeling. Despite their exquisite in vitro binding characteristics, low brain uptakes (likely due to two ionizable carboxylic acid groups) limited their potential as in vivo imaging agents. To improve brain penetration, we have successfully prepared a neutral radioiodinated probe [I-125]3. The improved probe displayed good binding affinity for Abeta aggregates (K-i = 2.0+/-0.2 using Abeta40 aggregates). In addition, the brominated counterpart displayed fluorescent-staining properties of Abeta plaques in postmortem AD brain sections similar to BSB, a fluoroscent probe reported previously. [I-125]3 gave excellent plaque labeling by film autoradiography of AD brain sections. Unlike [I-125]IMSB (which preferentially detects Abeta40 plaques), the improved radioioinated probe, [I-125]3, can readily detect plaques containing aggregates of both Abeta40 and Abeta42. The initial brain uptake of [I-125]3 in normal mice at 2 min p.i. was moderate (0.18% ID) and displayed a very slow washout from the brain (0.11 %.ID at 4 h p.i). Taken together, these data suggest that [I-125]3 is useful for in vitro plaque detection, it may not be suitable for in vivo monitoring of Abeta progression and deposition.

One of these, (R)-3-pyrrolidyl benzilate, was successfully radiolabeled with [C-11]methyl triflate and the resulting compound, (R)-N-[C-11]methyl-3-pyrrolidyl benzilate (3-[C-11]NMPYB), was evaluated as a reversible, acetylcholine-sensitive tracer for the mAChR (K-i of unlabeled 3-NMPYB is 0.72 nM). This compound displayed high, receptor-mediated retention in regions of the mouse and rat brain known to have high concentrations of mAChRs. Moreover, bolus studies in a pigtail monkey showed that this compound had superior clearance from the brain when compared to muscarinic radiotracers previously employed in human PET studies. Infusion studies in the same monkey revealed that it was possible to achieve equilibrium of radiotracer distribution for 3-[C-11]NMPYB in both the striatum and cortex. Sensitivity to endogenous acetylcholine levels was evaluated by injecting phenserine (5 mg/kg) into rats prior to administration of 3-[C-11]NMPYB in an equilibrium infusion protocol. This pretreatment produced a modest, statistically significant decrease (9-11%) in the distribution volume ratios for muscarinic receptor rich regions of the rat brain as compared to controls.

Substantial occupancy of muscarinic receptors may be an explanation for the low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects induced by olanzapine. Objectives: To obtain an in vivo measurement of muscarinic receptor occupancy by olanzapine compared with risperidone in patients with schizophrenia stabilised on medication. Methods: Five patients with schizophrenia treated with olanzapine and five patients treated with risperidone were studied. Muscarinic receptor occupancy in the striatum and cortex was studied in vivo with SPECT using [I-123]-IDEX as a radioligand. SPECT data were compared with those of six healthy subjects. Results: Patients stabilised on olanzapine showed significantly lower mean (+/- SD) striatal and cortical (1.50 +/-0.21 and 1.51 +/-0.22, respectively) muscarinic receptor binding ratios of [I-123]-IDEX (reflecting higher levels of muscarinic receptor occupancy) than controls (3.91 +/-0.61 and 3.65 +/-0.70, respectively). Furthermore, [I-123]-IDEX binding ratios in patients treated with risperidone were slightly lower than controls, reaching significance only in the striatum (2.99 +/-0.27 versus 3.91 +/-0.61, for risperidone and controls). Conclusions: The substantial occupancy of muscarinic receptors in the striatum and cortex by olanzapine may be an explanation for the low incidence and severity of extrapyramidal side effects of this antipsychotic drug. Furthermore, it may also explain the anticholinergic side effects of olanzapine.

We hypothesized that it is associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response and survival in men treated with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT). MethodsData of 180 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who were treated in sequential prospective radionuclide clinical trials from 2002 to 2021 (utilizing 177Lu-J591, 90Y-J591, 177Lu-PSMA-617, or 225Ac-J591) were retrospectively analyzed. We used a logistic regression to determine the association between NLR and & GE;50% PSA decline (PSA50) and a Cox proportional hazards model to investigate the association between NLR and overall survival (OS). ResultsA total of 94 subjects (52.2%) received 177Lu-J591, 51 (28.3%) 177Lu-PSMA-617, 28 (15.6%) 225Ac-J591, and 7 (3.9%) 90Y-J591. The median NLR of 3.75 was used as cut-off (low vs. high NLR; n = 90, respectively). On univariate analysis, NLR was not associated with PSA50 (HR 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.17, p = 0.067). However, it was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.09, p = 0.002), also after controlling for circulating tumor cell count and cancer and leukemia group B risk group (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.003-1.11, p = 0.036). Men with high NLR were at a higher hazard of death from all causes (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.05-1.94, p = 0.024). ConclusionsNLR provides prognostic information in the setting of patients with mCRPC receiving treatment with PSMA-TRT.	[Stangl-Kremser, Judith; Bander, Neil. H.

Patients with schizophrenia show alterations in function, structure and molecular composition of the hippocampus, and a recent study demonstrated aberrant levels of hippocampal alpha 5 subunit-containing GABA(A) receptors. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of tricyclic compounds on alpha 5 subunit-containing receptor subtypes. Experimental Approach Functional studies of effects by seven antipsychotic and antidepressant medications were performed in several GABA(A) receptor subtypes by two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology using Xenopus laevis oocytes. Computational structural analysis was employed to design mutated constructs of the alpha 5 subunit, probing a novel binding site. Radioligand displacement data complemented the functional and mutational findings. Key Results The antipsychotic drugs clozapine and chlorpromazine exerted functional inhibition on multiple GABA(A) receptor subtypes, including those containing alpha 5-subunits. Based on a chlorpromazine binding site observed in a GABA-gated bacterial homologue, we identified a novel site in alpha 5 GABA(A) receptor subunits and demonstrate differential usage of this and the orthosteric sites by these ligands. Conclusion and Implications Despite high molecular and functional similarities among the tested ligands, they reduce GABA currents by differential usage of allosteric and orthosteric sites. The chlorpromazine site we describe here is a new potential target for optimizing antipsychotic medications with beneficial polypharmacology. Further studies in defined subtypes are needed to substantiate mechanistic links between the therapeutic effects of clozapine and its action on certain GABA(A) receptor subtypes.

This was accomplished by studying the short-term effect of the cessation of dopaminergic medication on A2AR availability in non-dyskinetic patients with PD treated with dopaminergic medication. Methods: Eight PD patients (age 67.9 +/- 5.6 years; 6 men, 2 women) without dyskinesia were enrolled in this study. A2AR availability was measured using PET imaging with a [7-methyl-11C]-(E)-8-(3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)1,3,7-trimethylxanthine ([11C]TMSX) radioligand after a short term cessation of dopaminergic medication (12hrs for levodopa, 24hrs for dopamine agonists and MAO-B inhibitors). Repeated PET imaging was performed while the patients were back 'on' their regular dopaminergic medication (median 13 days after first imaging). Conventional MRI was acquired for anatomical reference. Specific binding of [11C]TMSX was quantified as distribution volume ratios (DVR) for caudate, pallidum and putamen using Logan graphical method with clustered gray matter reference region. Results: No significant differences were observed for the DVRs in all three striatal regions between 'on' and 'off' medication states. Strong correlations were also observed between the two states. Statistical equivalence was found in pallidum (TOST equivalence test, p = 0.045) and putamen (TOST equivalence test, p = 0.022), but not in caudate DVR (TOST equivalence test, p = 0.201) between the two medication states. Conclusions: Our results show that dopaminergic medication has no significant short-term effect on the availability of A2A receptors in putamen and pallidum of patients with PD. However, relatively poor repeatability was demonstrated in the caudate.

Identification of monellin as the first naturally derived proteinaceous allosteric agonist of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						allosteric modulator; biased modulation; G protein-coupled receptor; sweet protein	CALCIUM-SENSING RECEPTOR; SWEET PROTEINS; MODULATORS; TRANSDUCTION; PHARMACOLOGY; EXPRESSION; DISCOVERY; BRAZZEIN; DOMAIN; BIAS	Allosteric modulators bind sites distinct from orthosteric ligands, allowing for improved spatiotemporal control of receptors and greater subtype selectivity. However, we recently showed that allosteric ligands previously classified as selective for select Class C G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) had unappreciated activity at other off-target receptors, in some cases higher affinity, within the class. Here, we extended our investigation of off-target activity of "selective" allosteric ligands for the sweet taste receptor. Using metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu(5)) as a representative of Class C GPCR, we assessed the sweet protein, monellin and the small-molecule artificial sweetener, NHDC. We found that monellin, but not NHDC, is an agonist for mGlu(5). Radioligand binding and functional assays performed in cells expressing N-terminally truncated mGlu(5) demonstrated that monellin agonism was not mediated via the "common" allosteric binding site in the transmembrane domain but required the presence of the large extracellular N-terminal domain of mGlu(5). Monellin displayed neutral functional cooperativity with orthosteric ligands. However, monellin positively modulated the mGlu(5) PAM-agonist, VU0424465, activity in intracellular calcium assays, but the interaction was neutral in inositol phosphate accumulation assays. Furthermore, monellin mGlu(5) agonism was positively modulated by the mGlu(5) pure PAM, VU0360172. Taken together, these data indicate that monellin is an allosteric agonist for mGlu(5), binding to an allosteric binding site on the N-terminus that is functionally linked to the common Class C GPCR allosteric site in a biased manner. This is the first evidence of a naturally derived proteinaceous allosteric ligand for the mGlu receptor family.

Methods In the multicenter cross-sectional Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants (RODAM) study (N = 5898), we quantified autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65Ab) by radioligand binding assay (RBA) and established cut-offs for positivity by displacement analysis. In a subsample, we performed RBA for zinc transporter-8 autoantibodies (ZnT8Ab). Associations of environmental, sociodemographic, and clinical factors with GAD65Ab were calculated. Results In this study population (age: 46.1 +/- 11.9 years; female: 62%; Ghana-rural: 1111; Ghana-urban: 1455; Europe: 3332), 9.2% had diabetes with adult-onset. GAD65Ab concentrations were the highest in Ghana-rural (32.4; 10.8-71.3 U/mL), followed by Ghana-urban (26.0; 12.3-49.1 U/mL) and Europe (11.9; 3.0-22.8 U/mL) with no differences between European cities. These distributions were similar for ZnT8Ab. Current fever, history of fever, and higher concentrations of liver enzymes marginally explained site-specific GAD65Ab concentrations. GAD65Ab positivity was as frequent in diabetes as in nondiabetes (5.4% vs 6.1%; P = .25). This was also true for ZnT8Ab positivity. Conclusion Geographic location determines the occurrence of GAD65Ab and ZnT8Ab more than the diabetes status. Beta-cell autoimmunity may not be feasible to differentiate diabetes subgroups in this population.

The Interaction Between Neuroinflammation and β-Amyloid in Cognitive Decline in Parkinson's Disease	MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; beta-Amyloid; PET imaging; Parkinson's disease; Cognitive impairment	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; A-BETA; PET; PROTEIN; DEPOSITION; IMPAIRMENT; BINDING; BRAIN	Activated microglia have been reported to play an important role in Parkinson's disease (PD). A more rapid cognitive decline has been associated with deposits of beta-amyloid. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the role of brain beta-amyloid and its relationship with activated microglia in PD patients with normal and impaired cognition. We studied 17 PD patients with normal cognition (PDn), 12 PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), and 12 healthy controls (HCs) with [C-11] Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) to assess the impact of beta-amyloid deposition in the brain on microglial activation evaluated using the translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) radioligand [F-18]-FEPPA. [C-11] PIB distribution volume ratio was measured in cortical and subcortical regions. [F-18]-FEPPA total distribution volume values were compared for each brain region between groups to evaluate the effect of PIB positivity while adjusting for the TSPO rs6971 polymorphism. Factorial analysis of variance revealed a significant main effect of PIB positivity in the frontal lobe (F-(1,F- 34) = 7.1, p = 0.012). Besides the frontal (p = 0.006) and temporal lobe (p = 0.001), the striatum (p = 0.018), the precuneus (p = 0.019), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (p = 0.010) showed significant group x PIB positivity interaction effects. In these regions, PD-MCIs had significantly higher FEPPA V-T if PIB-positive. Our results indicate an interaction between amyloid-beta deposition and microglial activation in PD. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate if amyloid deposits cause neuroinflammation and further neurodegeneration or if increased microglia activation develops as a protective response.

In a clinical study in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, (+)-[F-18]flubatine ((+)-[F-18]1) was examined regarding its metabolic fate, in particular by identification of degradation products detected in plasma and urine. The investigations included an in vivo study of (+)-flubatine ((+)-1) in pigs and structural elucidation of formed metabolites by LC-MS/MS. Incubations of (+)-1 and (+)-[F-18]1 with human liver microsomes were performed to generate in vitro metabolites, as well as radiometabolites, which enabled an assignment of their structures by comparison of LC-MS/MS and radio-HPLC data. Plasma and urine samples taken after administration of (+)-[F-18]1 in humans were examined by radio-HPLC and, on the basis of results obtained in vitro and in vivo, formed radiometabolites were identified. In pigs, (+)-1 was monohydroxylated at different sites of the azabicyclic ring system of the molecule. Additionally, one intermediate metabolite underwent glucuronidation, as also demonstrated in vitro. In humans, a fraction of 95.9 +/- 1.9% (n = 10) of unchanged tracer remained in plasma, 30 min after injection. However, despite the low metabolic degradation, both radiometabolites formed in humans could be characterized as (i) a product of C-hydroxylation at the azabicyclic ring system, and (ii) a glucuronide conjugate of the precedingly-formed N8-hydroxylated (+)-[F-18]1.

Preliminary evidence that negative symptom severity relates to multilocus genetic profile for dopamine signaling capacity and D2 receptor binding in healthy controls and in schizophrenia	JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRIC RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Negative symptoms; Anhedonia; Genetic profile; Dopamine; PET	STRIATAL REWARD PREDICTION; IN-VIVO; TRANSPORTER AVAILABILITY; SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE; ABERRANT SALIENCE; D-2 RECEPTORS; ANHEDONIA; SPECT; PET; BRAIN	Deficits in central, subcortical dopamine (DA) signaling may underlie negative symptom severity, particularly anhedonia, in healthy individuals and in schizophrenia. To investigate these relationships, we assessed negative symptoms with the Schedule for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms and the Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) and self-reported anhedonia with the Scales for Physical and Social Anhedonia (SPSA), Temporal Experience of Pleasure Scale, and Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale in 36 healthy controls (HC), 27 siblings (SIB) of individuals with schizophrenia, and 66 individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SCZ). A subset of participants (N = 124) were genotyped for DA-related polymorphisms in genes for DRD4, DRD2/ANKK1, DAT1, and COMT, which were used to construct biologically-informed multi-locus genetic profile (MGP) scores reflective of subcortical dopaminergic signaling. DA receptor type 2 (D2R) binding was assessed among a second subset of participants (N = 23) using PET scans with the D2R-selective, non-displaceable radioligand (N-[C-11]methyl)benperidol. Higher MGP scores, reflecting elevated subcortical dopaminergic signaling capacity, were associated with less negative symptom severity, as measured by the BNSS, across all participants. In addition, higher striatal D2R binding was associated with less physical and social anhedonia, as measured by the SPSA, across HC, SIB, and SCZ. The current preliminary findings support the hypothesis that subcortical DA function may contribute to negative symptom severity and self-reported anhedonia, independent of diagnostic status.

Ictal lack of binding to brain parenchyma suggests integrity of the blood-brain barrier for <SUP>11</SUP>C-dihydroergotamine during glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine	BRAIN			English	Article						migraine; headache; drug treatment; imaging	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; H-3 DIHYDROERGOTAMINE; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RECEPTOR; ERGOTAMINE; NITROGLYCERIN; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; AGONIST; SITES	For many decades a breakdown of the blood-brain barrier has been postulated to occur in migraine. Hypothetically this would facilitate access of medications, such as dihydroergotamine or triptans, to the brain despite physical properties otherwise restricting their entry. We studied the permeability of the blood-brain barrier in six migraineurs and six control subjects at rest and during acute glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine attacks using positron emission tomography with the novel radioligand C-11-dihydroergotamine, which is chemically identical to pharmacologically active dihydroergotamine. The influx rate constant K-i, average dynamic image and time activity curve were assessed using arterial blood sampling and served as measures for receptor binding and thus blood-brain barrier penetration. At rest, there was binding of C-11-dihydroergotamine in the choroid plexus, pituitary gland, and venous sinuses as expected from the pharmacology of dihydroergotamine. However, there was no binding to the brain parenchyma, including the hippocampus, the area with the highest density of the highest-affinity dihydroergotamine receptors, and the raphe nuclei, a postulated brainstem site of action during migraine, suggesting that dihydroergotamine is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. This binding pattern was identical in migraineurs during glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine attacks as well as in matched control subjects. We conclude that C-11-dihydroergotamine is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier interictally or ictally demonstrating that the blood-brain barrier remains tight for dihydroergotamine during acute glyceryl trinitrate-induced migraine attacks.

Autoantibody-defined risk for Type 1 diabetes mellitus in a general population of schoolchildren: results of the Karlsburg Type 1 Diabetes Risk Study after 18 years	DIABETIC MEDICINE			English	Article							ANTIBODY STANDARDIZATION PROGRAM; INSULIN; PREDICTION; PROGRESSION; CHILDREN; POSITIVITY; ASSAYS; AGE	AimsTo investigate the occurrence of diabetes-associated autoantibodies and cumulative Type 1 diabetes risk over 18 years in a general population of schoolchildren. MethodsIn the Karlsburg Type 1 Diabetes Risk Study, 11 986 schoolchildren from north-eastern Germany without a family history of diabetes were screened for glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies and insulin autoantibodies by radioligand binding assay. Those children found to be autoantibody-positive were invited to follow-up examinations and HLA-DQB1 genotyping, and were followed for progression to Type 1 diabetes. ResultsAt first follow-up, 119 children had single and 36 children had multiple autoantibodies. Of the multiple autoantibody-positive children, 33 had at least one diabetes-associated HLA-DQB1 allele (*02 and/or *0302). A total of 26 children progressed to Type 1 diabetes, of whom 22 had multiple autoantibodies. The male-to-female ratio of those who progressed to Type 1 diabetes was 1.6. The positive predictive value of multiple autoantibodies was 61.1% compared with only 23.7% for diabetes-associated HLA-DQB1 genotypes among all those who were autoantibody-positive. The cumulative risk was 59.7% after 10 years and 75.1% after 18 years for children with multiple autoantibodies compared with 1.2 and 22.6%, respectively, for children with single autoantibodies (P<0.001). Among the three examined autoantibodies, insulinoma-associated antigen-2 antibodies conferred the highest risk. ConclusionsThe diabetes risk in schoolchildren with multiple autoantibodies was similar to the risk reported in other studies for genetically preselected probands; thus, a combined autoantibody-based screening could effectively identify at-risk individuals from the general population for future intervention trials.

However, no human dosimetry data have been published. We are planning to use this radiotracer for investigating NMDA receptor function in systemic lupus erythematosus, traumatic brain injury, and Parkinson disease. We have therefore undertaken C-11-CNS5161 PET imaging to measure the whole-body distribution of this radionuclide and to estimate radiation dose to various organs. Methods: Dynamic PET studies of the whole body were performed on 5 healthy adults. Regions of interest were drawn over the visualized structures. Resultant time-activity curves were generated and used to determine residence times for dosimetry calculations. S factors were implemented within the OLINDA/EXM software for each structure or organ. Results: For C-11-CNS5161, organ doses ranged from 0.0002 to 0.0393 mGy/MBq (0.0006-0.1455 rad/mCi). The critical organ for radiation burden was the lungs, with a dose of 0.0393 mGy/MBq (0.1455 rad/mCi). Radiation doses to the reproductive and blood-forming organs were 0.0023, 0.0002, and 0.0020 mGy/MBq (0.0086, 0.0006, and 0.0074 rad/mCi) for the ovaries, testes, and red marrow, respectively. The effective dose equivalent was 0.0106 mSv/MBq (0.0392 rem/mCi). Conclusion: The radiation dosimetry for C-11-CNS5161 for a standard single injection of 555 MBq (15 mCi) will result in an effective dose equivalent of 5.9 mSv (0.59 rem) and a lung dose of 21.8 mGy (2.18 rad) in young, healthy subjects.

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of ZnT8 autoantibodies in patients with T1D and their first degree relatives (FDR) from a multiethnic population, as well as its relation with the insulin (INS) or the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor 22 (PTPN22) gene polymorphisms. Subjects and methods: ZnT8A were analyzed in sera from T1D patients (n = 72, mean age of 30.3 +/- 11.4 years) of variable duration (15.7 +/- 11.8 years) and their FDR (n = 78, mean age of 18.3 +/- 9.1 years) by a triple mix Radioligand Binding Assay (RBA) for the ZnT8 autoantibody (ZnT8-RWQ) variants. SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) for INS and PTPN22 were genotyped. Results: The prevalence of ZnT8A was higher in T1D patients than FDR, for ZnT8TripleA (24% vs. 4%, p = 0.001), ZnT8RA (24% vs. 4%, p < 0.001) and ZnT8QA (15% vs. 3%, p = 0.004). All FDR with ZnT8A (n = 3) had at least another positive antibody. Heterozygosis for PTPN22 was associated with a higher frequency of ZnT8TripleA (p = 0.039) and ZnT8RA (p = 0.038). Conclusions: ZnT8A is observed in non-Caucasian patients with T1D, even years after the disease onset, as well as in their FDR. In those, there was an overlap between ZnT8A and other T1D antibodies. ZnT8A was associated with PTPN22 polymorphisms. Further longitudinal studies are necessary to elucidate the importance of these findings in the natural history of T1D patients with multiethnic background.

Previous research has showed that chronic stress causes the deactivation of the limbic system. However, the influence of the acute physical stress on the serotonergic system in vivo was primarily unclear. The purpose of this research is to elucidate the effects of the acute physical stress in vivo using PET. For quantification of the 5-HT1A receptors in the brain, we measured [F-18]Mefway uptake in the two experiment groups (control and despair rats). The despair group was subjected to the external stressful situation (i.e., forced swimming) and total duration time of immobility, refers to the despair severity, and was analyzed. In the intercomparison experiment, the resulting PET images of [F-18]Mefway in the despair rat displayed a significant reduction of radioactivity in the hippocampus (HP) compared with the control. The nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) refers to the ratio of the concentration of radioligand in the receptor-rich region (i.e., HP) to the concentration of that in the receptor-free region (i.e., cerebellum). The hippocampal uptake and the BPND in the despair group were respectively about 25 and 18% lower than those of the control group. The ratio of specific binding to nonspecific binding in the despair group was 18% lower than that of the control. In the intracomparison experiments, the BPND and immobility in the despair group showed a strong negative correlation. Taken together, the data illustrates that an acute physical stress induces the change in the serotonergic system that correlates with the behavioral despair. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Thus, [C-11] AZ10419369 may serve as a useful tool in clinical studies of the pathophysiology and pharmacological treatment of diseases related to the serotonin system, such as depression and anxiety disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the test-retest reliability of [C-11]AZ10419369. Eight men were examined with PET and [C-11] AZ10419369 twice on the same day. The binding potentials (BPND) of [C-11]AZ10419369 in selected serotonergic projection areas and in the raphe nuclei (RN) were determined using the simplified reference tissue model, and for comparison also using a wavelet-aided parametric imaging approach. The BPND values obtained from the first and second PET scans were compared by means of descriptive statistics, difference, absolute variability and intraclass correlation coefficient. Similar BPND values were obtained with the two methods. The absolute mean differences in BPND between PET 1 and PET 2 were less than 3 % in all serotonergic projection regions. Absolute variabilities were low in cortical regions (5 - 7 %), low to moderate (7 - 14 %) in subcortical regions, but higher (20 %) in the RN. The BPND of [C-11]AZ10419369 is highly reproducible in cortical regions and satisfactory in subcortical projection areas. The variability in the RN is higher. Thus larger sample sizes or larger divergences are required to assess a potential difference between subjects or between experimental conditions in this region.

The exact mechanism underlying the clinical effects of SSRIs remains unclear, although increased synaptic serotonin concentrations have been hypothesized to be an initial step. [C-11] AZ10419369 is a novel 5-HT1B receptor selective radioligand, which is sensitive to changes in endogenous serotonin concentrations. To assess whether a single dose of the SSRI escitalopram affects endogenous serotonin concentrations in serotonergic projection areas and in the raphe nuclei (RN), three cynomolgus monkeys and nine human subjects underwent PET examinations with [C-11]AZ10419369 at baseline conditions and after escitalopram administration. In monkeys, the binding potential (BPND) was significantly lower post dose compared to baseline in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, occipital cortex, thalamus, midbrain and RN (p < 0.05). In humans, the BPND tended to decrease in RN post dose (p = 0.08). In all serotonergic projection areas, the BPND was conversely higher post dose compared to baseline. The increase was significant in a combined region of all projection areas (p = 0.01) and in occipital and temporal cortex (p < 0.05). SSRIs are generally assumed to elevate endogenous serotonin concentrations in projection areas, evoking the antidepressant effect. In the present study, a single, clinically relevant, dose of escitalopram was found to decrease serotonin concentrations in serotonergic projection areas in humans. Hypothetically, desensitization of inhibitory serotonergic autoreceptors will cause the serotonin concentration in projection areas to increase over time with chronic administration. Thus, the findings in the present study might aid in understanding the mechanism of SSRIs' delayed onset of clinical effect.

Methods In the cross-sectional and case-control study, peripheral blood samples were collected from 600 T1D patients and 102 healthy controls. The genetic polymorphisms of HLA-A and DRB1 are examined with polymerase chain reaction-sequence oligonucleotide probe method. The zinc transporter 8 antibody (ZnT8A), glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA) and protein-tyrosine-phosphatase-2 autoantibody (IA2A) were detected by radioligand assay. Results The A*2402, DRB1*0301, DRB1*0405 and DRB1*0901 alleles, and A*1101-DRB1*0901, A*2402-DRB1*0405 and A*2402-DRB1*0901 haplotypes were associated with T1D (all p < 0.05). The positive rates of ZnT8A in patients carried DRB1*0901, IA2A in patients carried DRB1*0405 and A*1101-DRB1*0901 and GADA in patients carried DRB1*0901 and A*2402-DRB1*0901 were significantly higher than those not carried (p < 0.05). HLA-DRB1*0901 was the independent risk factor of positive antibody in T1D patients. In addition, higher body mass index is also related with the loss of islet function besides high-risk HLA gene and islet autoantibody (p < 0.05). Conclusions The discordant association of autoantibodies with high-risk HLA gene may indicate the different immunology mechanisms of those autoantibodies. And metabolic burden resulting from overweight may accelerate apoptosis of beta cells. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Characterization of RO4583298 as a novel potent, dual antagonist with <i>in vivo</i> activity at tachykinin NK<sub>1</sub> and NK<sub>3</sub> receptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						RO4583298; neurokinin; dual NK1/NK3 antagonist; senktide; inositol phosphate accumulation; Schild analysis; firing frequency; dopaminergic neurone; GR73632; gerbil foot tapping; mouse tail whips	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; INHIBITORY SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; SUBSTANCE-P; GUINEA-PIG; HUMAN BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS; RAT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; VITRO	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Clinical results of osanetant and talnetant (selective-NK3 antagonists) indicate that blocking the NK3 receptor could be beneficial for the treatment of schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to characterize the in vitro and in vivo properties of a novel dual NK1/NK3 antagonist, RO4583298 (2-phenyl-N-(pyridin-3-yl)-N-methylisobutyramide derivative). EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH RO4583298 in vitro pharmacology was investigated using radioligand binding ([3H]-SP, [3H]-osanetant, [3H]-senktide), [3H]-inositol-phosphate accumulation Schild analysis (SP- or [MePhe7]-NKB-induced) and electrophysiological studies in guinea-pig substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). The in vivo activity of RO4583298 was assessed using reversal of GR73632-induced foot tapping in gerbils (GFT; NK1) and senktide-induced tail whips in mice (MTW; NK3). KEY RESULTS RO4583298 has a high-affinity for NK1 (human and gerbil) and NK3 (human, cynomolgus monkey, gerbil and guinea-pig) receptors and behaves as a pseudo-irreversible antagonist. Unusually it binds with high-affinity to mouse and rat NK3, yet with a partial non-competitive mode of antagonism. In guinea-pig SNpc, RO4583298 inhibited the senktide-induced potentiation of spontaneous activity of dopaminergic neurones with an apparent non-competitive mechanism of action. RO4583298 (p.o.) robustly blocked the GFT response, and inhibited the MTW. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS RO4583298 is a high-affinity, non-competitive, long-acting in vivo NK1/NK3 antagonist; hence providing a useful in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tool to investigate the roles of NK1 and NK3 receptors in psychiatric disorders.

Functional alpha-1B adrenergic receptors on human epicardial coronary artery endothelial cells	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Human heart; Endothelial cell; Coronary artery; Alpha-1-adrenergic receptor; Alpha-adrenergic antagonists	BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA; LIPID-LOWERING TREATMENT; ATTACK TRIAL ALLHAT; NITRIC-OXIDE; ALPHA(1)-ADRENOCEPTOR ANTAGONIST; KNOCKOUT MOUSE; SUBTYPES; ERK; ANGIOGENESIS; NAFTOPIDIL	Alpha-1-adrenergic receptors (alpha 1-ARs) regulate coronary arterial blood flow by binding catecholamines, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (EPI), causing vasoconstriction when the endothelium is disrupted. Among the three alpha 1-AR subtypes (alpha 1A, alpha 1B, and alpha 1D), the alpha 1D subtype predominates in human epicardial coronary arteries and is functional in human coronary smooth muscle cells (SMCs). However, the presence or function of alpha 1-ARs on human coronary endothelial cells (ECs) is unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that human epicardial coronary ECs express functional alpha 1-ARs. Cultured human epicardial coronary artery ECs were studied using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, radioligand binding, immunoblot, and H-3-thymidine incorporation. The alpha 1B-subtype messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was predominant in cultured human epicardial coronary ECs (90-95% of total alpha 1-AR mRNA), and total alpha 1-AR binding density in ECs was twice that in coronary SMCs. Functionally, NE and EPI through the alpha 1B subtype activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in ECs, stimulated phosphorylation of EC endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and increased deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. These results are the first to demonstrate alpha 1-ARs on human coronary ECs and indicate that the alpha 1B subtype is predominant. Our findings provide another potential mechanism for adverse cardiac effects of drug antagonists that nonselectively inhibit all three alpha 1-AR subtypes.

Hence, we investigated this particular selectivity and characterized the binding sites found in dog lungs. AM and other peptides belonging to the calcitonin peptide family, including calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), adrenomedullin-2 (AM2), amylin and proadrenomedullin N-terminal peptide (PAMP), were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Receptor binding assays were performed by using [I-125]AM as a radioligand on dog lung homogenates. It was found that AM bound with potent affinity, displaying in fact a high and a low affinity binding site. Moreover, competition binding assays using peptide ligands showed the following ranking for displacement: AM>AM (13-52)>CGRP approximate to AM2 >= AM(22-52)>= AM2(16-47)>CGRP(8-37)>amylin approximate to PAMP. Thus, these results strongly suggested that the AM binding site found in dog lungs and acting as a clearance receptor is mainly the adrenomedullin AM(1) receptor subtype. The pharmacophores underlying AM(1) binding affinity and specificity were studied by determining the key amino acids, the minimal peptide fragment, and some aspects of the secondary structures. So far, it appeared that the C-terminal segment of human AM is an essential feature for binding. Also, the alpha-helix secondary structure found in the AM molecule would facilitate the ligand recognition process with the AM receptor in dog lungs. Our results demonstrated that AM or some analogs or fragments could be suitable radiopharmaceutical agents for lung imaging. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The personality trait openness is related to cerebral 5-HTT levels	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER BINDING; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POLYMORPHISM 5-HTTLPR; HUMAN BRAIN; DEPRESSION; GENE; DISORDER; STRESS	Potentiation of serotonergic transmission increases cognitive flexibility, but can in other circumstances increase sensitivity to stressful environmental cues. The personality trait Openness to Experience reflects and is also associated with an increased risk for mood disorders. We hypothesized that the personality trait has an association with a biomarker of serotonergic transmission, the plasma membrane serotonin transporter (5-HTT). In 50 healthy volunteers, we tested for correlations between scores on the NEO-PI-R scale Openness to Experience and its subscales, and cerebral binding of the 5-HTT selective PET radioligand [C-11] DASB. Subjects were genotyped for the 5-HTT long/short polymorphism, and for a single nucleotide polymorphism in the long allele, designated L-A/L-G. Midbrain [C-11] DASB binding correlated negatively with scores for Openness to Experience and its two subscales, Openness to Actions and Openness to Values. The latter subscore was negatively correlated with [C-11] DASB binding in all brain regions in which [C-11] DASB binding was quantified. Genetic analysis showed that homozygote LA carriers had significantly higher [C-11] DASB binding in the caudate nucleus, but no significant differences in openness scores. Thus, high scores in personality facets indicative of cognitive flexibility and openness to change are associated with lower [C-11] DASB binding. Lower abundance of 5-HTT sites may result in potentiation of serotonergic signaling, which occurs during treatment with SSRIs. We speculate that the set-point of serotonergic signaling in an individual represents a trade-off between flexibility and vulnerability when exposed to environmental stress. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A validated approach for analysis of [(11)C]FMZ is the invasive one-tissue (1T) compartmental model. However, it would be advantageous to analyse FMZ binding with whole-brain pixel-based methods that do not require a-priori hypotheses regarding preselected regions. Therefore, in this study we compared invasive and noninvasive data-driven methods (Logan graphical analysis, LGA; multilinear reference tissue model, MRTM2; spectral analysis, SA; basis pursuit denoising, BPD) with the 1T model. We focused on two aspects: (1) replacing the arterial input function analyses with a reference tissue method using the pons as the reference tissue, and (2) shortening the scan protocol from 90 min to 60 min. Dynamic PET scans were conducted in seven healthy volunteers with arterial blood sampling. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were selected as the common outcome measure. The SA, LGA with and without arterial input, and MRTM2 agreed best with the 1T model DVR values. The invasive and noninvasive BPD were slightly less well correlated. The full protocol of a 90-min emission data performed better than the 60-min protocol, but the 60-min protocol still delivered useful data, as assessed by the coefficient of variation, and the correlation and bias analyses. This study showed that the SA, LGA and MRTM2 are valid methods for the quantification of benzodiazepine receptor binding with [(11)C]FMZ using an invasive or noninvasive protocol, and therefore have the potential to reduce the invasiveness of the procedure.

Kinetic and Thermodynamic Assessment of Binding of Serotonin Transporter Inhibitors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BACTERIAL HOMOLOG; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; AFFINITY; NOREPINEPHRINE; OPTIMIZATION; MECHANISM; SITE	Several serotonin reuptake inhibitors are in clinical use for treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. However, to date, reported pharmacological differentiation of these ligands has focused mainly on their equilibrium binding affinities for the serotonin transporter. This study takes a new look at antidepressant binding modes using radioligand binding assays with [H-3]S-citalopram to determine equilibrium and kinetic rate constants across multiple temperatures. The observed dissociation rate constants at 26 C fall into a narrow range for all molecules. Conversely, association rate constants generally decreased with increasing equilibrium binding affinities. Consistent with this, the measured activation energy for S-citalopram association was relatively large (19.5 kcal . mol(-1)), suggesting conformational change upon ligand binding. For most of the drugs, including citalopram, the enthalpy (Delta H-O) and entropy (-T Delta S-O) contributions to reaction energetics were determined by van't Hoff analyses to be roughly equivalent (25-75% Delta G(O)) and to correlate (positively for enthalpy) with the polar surface area of the drug. However, the binding of the drug fluvoxamine was predominantly entropically driven. When these data are considered in the context of the physicochemical properties of these ligands, two distinct binding modes can be proposed. The citalopram-type binding mode probably uses a polar binding pocket that allows charged or polar interactions between ligand and receptor with comparatively small loss in enthalpy due to dehydration. The fluvoxamine-type binding mode is fueled by energy released upon burying hydrophobic ligand moieties into a binding pocket that is flexible enough to suffer minimal loss in entropy from conformational constraint.

We report here on the rhesus monkey biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [(18)F]3-fluoro-5-[(pyridine-3-yl)ethynyl]benzonitrile, [(18)F]F-PEB, a mGIuR5 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. Methods Three male and two female rhesus monkeys were imaged using the Discovery ST PET/computed tomography scanner. A total of 25 whole body PET emissions were acquired over 3 h (23 emissions in one subject). Regions of interest were drawn in the brain, lungs, heart, liver, spleen, bladder, and testes. The absorbed radiation dose was calculated using OLIN DA v1. Results At the end of the imaging session, 45% of the [(18)F]F-PEB activity had been excreted by the liver and into the gastrointestinal tract and 10% had been excreted into the urinary bladder. When extrapolating to the adult human, the largest absorbed radiation doses were located in the upper large intestine (males: 0.18 mGy/MBq, females: 0.20 mGy/MBq) and small intestine (males: 0.16 mGy/MBq, females: 0.19 mGy/MBq). Effective radiation dose was 0.033 mSv/MBq for males and 0.034 mSv/MBq for females, similar to many other [(18)F] ligands. Conclusion The effective radiation dose of [(18)F]F-PEB obtained from rhesus is similar to many other clinically utilized [(18)F] ligands.

Bioisosteric phentolamine analogs as selective human α<sub>2</sub>- versus α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor ligands	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Experimental Biology 2003 Annual Meeting	APR 11-15, 2003	SAN DIEGO, CA			alpha(2)-adrenoceptor; G-protein coupled receptor; phentolamine; selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor ligand; radioligand binding assay; cAMP	RECEPTOR; IDENTIFICATION; ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION	Phentolamine is known to act as a competitive, non-subtype-selective alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist. In an attempt to improve alpha(2)- versus alpha(1)-adrenoceptor selectivity and alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtype-selectivity, two new chemical series of bioisosteric phentolamine analogs were prepared and evaluated. These compounds were evaluated for binding affinities on alpha(1)- (alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)-) and alpha(2)- (alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, alpha(2C)-) adrenoceptor subtypes that had been stably expressed in human embryonic kidney and Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, respectively. Methylation of the phenolic hydroxy group and replacement of the 4-methyl group of phentolamine with varying lipophilic substituents yielded bioisosteric analogs selective for the alpha(2)- versus alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Within the alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, these analogs bound with higher affinity at the alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-subtypes as compared to the alpha(2B)-subtype. In particular, the t-butyl analog was found to be the most selective, its binding at the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor (Ki=3.6 nM) being 37- to 173-fold higher than that at the alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, and around 2- and 19-fold higher than at the alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors, respectively. Data from luciferase reporter gene assays confirmed the functional antagonist activities of selected compounds from the bioisosteric series on human alpha(1A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors. Thus, the results with these bioisosteric analogs of phentolamine provide a lead to the rational design of potent and selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor ligands that may be useful in improving the therapeutic profile of this drug class for human disorders.

Androgen deprivation is the only effective systemic therapy available for patients with prostatic carcinoma, but is associated with a gradual transition to a hormone-refractory prostate cancer (HRCAP) in which ligand-independent activation of the androgen receptor has been implicated. The beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) is a well-known activator of the androgen receptor. METHODS. Prostatic cell lines were analyzed using cDNA micro-array, real time RT-PCR, radioligand binding assay, cAMP measurements, transfection and thymidine incorporation assay. Clinical specimens were studied by immunohistochemistry and Affymetrix microarrays. RESULTS. Here, we show that beta(2)-AR was transiently down-regulated both at mRNA- and protein levels when hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells, LNCaP, were cultured in steroid stripped medium (charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum) or when the cells were treated with the anti-androgen, bicalutamide (Casodex). The number of beta-adrenergic receptors was modestly up-regulated in androgen independent cell lines (LNCaP-C4, LNCaP-C4-2 and DU145) compared to LNCaP. Triiodothyronine (T3) increased the level of beta(2)-AR and the effect of T3 was inhibited by bicalutamide. Immunohistochemical staining of human prostate specimens showed high expression of beta(2)-AR in glandular, epithelial cells and increased expression in malignant cells compared to benign hyperplasia and normal tissue. Interestingly, beta(2)-AR mRNA was strongly down-regulated by androgen ablation therapy of prostate cancer patients. CONCLUSION. The level of beta(2)-AR was increased by T3 in prostatic adenocarcinoma cells and reduced in prostate cancer patients who had received androgen ablation therapy for 3 months.

The positron emission tomography tracer PIB (Pittsburgh Compound-B, 2-[4'-(methylamino)phenyl]-6-hydroxybenzothiazole) was developed to target senile plaques, an amyloid containing pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease, formed from the amyloid-beta peptide. Despite the fact that PIB was developed from the pan-amyloid staining dye thioflavin T, no detailed characterisation of its interaction with other amyloid structures has been reported. In this study, we demonstrate the presence of a high affinity binding site (K-d similar to 4 nM) for benzothiazole derivatives, including [3H]-PIB, on alpha-synuclein (AS) filaments generated in vitro, and further characterise this binding site through the use of radioligand displacement assays employing 4-N-methylamino-4'-hydroxystilbene (SB13) (K-i = 87 nM) and 2-(1-{6-[(2-fluoroethyl(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile (FDDNP) (K-i = 210 nM). Despite the presence of a high-affinity binding site on AS filaments, no discernible interaction of [3H]-PIB was detected with amygdala sections from Parkinson's disease cases containing frequent AS-immunoreactive Lewy bodies and related neurities. These findings suggest that the density and/or accessibility of AS binding sites in vivo are significantly less than those associated with amyloid-beta peptide lesions. Lewy bodies pathology is therefore unlikely to contribute significantly to the retention of PIB in positron emission tomography imaging studies.

An allosteric modulator of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor possessing cognition-enhancing properties in vivo	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							NICOTINIC RECEPTOR; AGONIST; MEMORY; RESPONSES; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RECOGNITION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; DEFICITS; WORKING	Augmentation of nicotinic alpha 7 receptor function is considered to be a potential therapeutic strategy aimed at ameliorating cognitive and mnemonic dysfunction in relation to debilitating pathological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. In the present report, a novel positive allosteric modulator of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR),1-(5-chloro-2-hydroxy-phenyl)-3-(2-chloro-5- trifluoromethylphenyl)urea (NS1738), is described. NS1738 was unable to displace or affect radioligand binding to the agonist binding site of nicotinic receptors, and it was devoid of effect when applied alone in electrophysiological paradigms. However, when applied in the presence of acetylcholine (ACh), NS1738 produced a marked increase in the current flowing through alpha 7 nAChRs, as determined in both oocyte electrophysiology and patchclamp recordings from mammalian cells. NS1738 acted by increasing the peak amplitude of ACh-evoked currents at all concentrations; thus, it increased the maximal efficacy of ACh. Oocyte experiments indicated an increase in ACh potency as well. NS1738 had only marginal effects on the desensitization kinetics of alpha 7 nAChRs, as determined from patch-clamp studies of both transfected cells and cultured hippocampal neurons. NS1738 was modestly brain-penetrant, and it was demonstrated to counteract a (-)-scopolamine-induced deficit in acquisition of a water-maze learning task in rats. Moreover, NS1738 improved performance in the rat social recognition test to the same extent as (-)-nicotine, demonstrating that NS1738 is capable of producing cognitive enhancement in vivo. These data support the notion that alpha 7 nAChR allosteric modulation may constitute a novel pharmacological principle for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction.

Quantification of dopamine transporter binding using [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FP-β-CIT and positron emission tomography	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						[F-18]FP-beta-CIT; plasma input model; PET; reference tissue model; SUV; tracer kinetic model	BETA-CIT; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; IMAGE REGISTRATION; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; PET DATA; SPECT; QUANTITATION; RADIOLIGAND	The purpose of this study was to compare different kinetic and semi-quantitative methods for analysing human [F-18]FP-beta-CIT studies: plasma input models, simplified (SRTM) and full (FRTM) reference tissue models, standard uptake values (SUV) and SUV ratios (SUVr). Both simulations and clinical evaluations were performed to determine the effects of noise, scan duration and blood volume on Akaike model selection, and on precision and accuracy of estimated parameters. For typical noise levels (COV similar to 2.5%) and scan durations (< 90mins), simulations provided poor fits (Akaike criterion) in case of reversible plasma input models showing a relatively high number of outliers compared with the two-tissue irreversible model. Reference tissue models provided more reliable fits, which were nearly independent of noise and scan duration. For clinical data, two tissue irreversible and reversible plasma input models fitted striatum curves equally well (Akaike criterion). BP with plasma input models were less precise and contained more outliers than BP obtained with SRTM or FRTM. Among all methods tested, SRTM showed the highest contrast between patients and controls. When differentiating between patients and controls, SUVr performed almost equally well as SRTM, although contrast between striatum and background was lower. In conclusion, SRTM provided BP estimates with the highest precision and accuracy. Moreover, SRTM provided good contrast between patients and controls, and between striatum and background. SRTM is therefore the method of choice for quantitative [F-18]FP-beta-CIT studies. SUVr might be an alternative for larger clinical trials.

Characterization of Kir1.1 channels with the use of a radiolabeled derivative of tertiapin	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							RECTIFIER K+ CHANNELS; HIGH-AFFINITY INHIBITOR; POTASSIUM CHANNEL; DIRECT ASSOCIATION; BINDING-SITES; ROMK1; SELECTIVITY; CONDUCTION; CHARYBDOTOXIN; MARGATOXIN	Inward rectifier potassium channels (Kir) play critical roles in cell physiology. Despite representing the simplest tetrameric potassium channel structures, the pharmacology of this channel family remains largely undeveloped. In this respect, tertiapin (TPN), a 21 amino acid peptide isolated from bee venom, has been reported to inhibit Kir1.1 and Kir3.1/3.4 channels with high affinity by binding to the M1-M2 linker region of these channels. The features of the peptide-channel interaction have been explored electrophysiologically, and these studies have identified ways by which to alter the composition of the peptide without affecting its biological activity. In the present study, the TPN derivative, TPN-Y1/K12/Q13, has been synthesized and radiolabeled to high specific activity with I-125. TPN-Y1/K12/Q13 and mono-iodo-TPN-Y1/K12/Q13 ([I-127]TPN-Y1/K12/Q13) inhibit with high affinity rat but not human Kir1.1 channels stably expressed in HEK293 cells. [I-125]TPN-Y1/K12/Q13 binds in a saturable, time-dependent, and reversible manner to HEK293 cells expressing rat Kir1.1, as well as to membranes derived from these cells, and the pharmacology of the binding reaction is consistent with peptide binding to Kir1.1 channels. Studies using chimeric channels indicate that the differences in TPN sensitivity between rat and human Kir1.1 channels are due to the presence of two nonconserved residues within the M1-M2 linker region. When these results are taken together, they demonstrate that [I-125] TPN-Y1/K12/Q13 represents the first high specific activity radioligand for studying rat Kir1.1 channels and suggest its utility for identifying other Kir channel modulators.

The functional neuroanatomy of these MDMA effects was visualised using 2-deoxyglucose imaging of local cerebral glucose use (LCMRglu), whilst MDMA-induced serotonergic neurotoxicity was measured by radioligand binding with [H-3]paroxetine. Acute MDMA alone markedly decreased most typical elements of social interaction but increased adjacent lying, a behaviour that also contains social elements. In animals pre-exposed to MDMA, decreased [H-3]paroxetine binding indicated serotonergic terminal depletion, and in these animals significant increases in locomotor activity, exploratory behaviour and aggressive behaviour were found. Both behavioural effects and also the metabolic activation induced by acute MDMA were potentiated in rats previously exposed to the drug. In conclusion, a single dose of MDMA caused marked changes in social behaviour acutely that might be interpreted either as a decrease or increase in anxiety. Three weeks after MDMA a behavioural disinhibition similar to psychomotor agitation, a symptom connected to depression or mania, and a sensitization to the acute effects of MDMA are apparent in both the behavioural and brain metabolic effects of the drug.

Determination of binding site residues responsible for the subunit selectivity of novel marine-derived compounds on kainate receptors	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PARTIAL AGONIST ACTION; PARTICLE MESH EWALD; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURES; STRUCTURAL BASIS; AMINO-ACID; ANTAGONIST LY293558; GENETIC ALGORITHM; ACTIVATION; GLUR5	Dysiherbaine (DH) and related molecules are high-affinity, subunit-selective kainate receptor (KAR) ligands originally isolated from a marine sponge. To elucidate why DH, an agonist, and MSVIII-19, a competitive antagonist, bind selectively to glutamate receptor (GluR) 5 but not to the KA2 KAR subunit, we used molecular dynamics simulations to generate binding models that were tested experimentally in radioligand binding and electrophysiological assays. Three candidate sites, Val685, Leu735, and Ser741 in GluR5, corresponding to Ile669, Phe719, and Met725 in KA2, were predicted to underlie the distinct binding profiles of the marine toxins. Single or multiple reciprocal mutations introduced into the receptor subunits produced a variety of effects on binding affinity. Most notably, mutation of Met725 to serine in KA2 increased the affinity of DH by 350-fold; in contrast, mutation of one or more of the residues in GluR5 did not markedly alter DH binding. MSVIII-19 affinity for the KA2 subunit was significantly increased in multiple site mutants, and reciprocal mutations in the GluR5 subunit produced substantial (700-fold) reductions in MSVIII-19 affinity. Physiological characterization of the double- and triple-mutant subunits demonstrated altered functional behavior consistent with the changes in binding affinity. The results provide experimental support for the importance of these three ligand binding domain (LBD) residues and suggest steric hindrance in the KA2 subunit LBD is largely responsible for the very low affinity for the two compounds. In this study, we identified the molecular basis for subunit selectivity of these marine-derived molecules on KARs, which could facilitate the rational design of selective ligands with distinct pharmacological profiles.

The purpose of these studies was to explore additional structure-activity relationships of selective androgen receptor modulators to enhance their AR binding affinity, AR-mediated transcriptional activation, and in vivo pharmacological activity. The AR binding affinity (Ki) of 29 novel synthetic AR ligands was determined by a radioligand competitive binding assay and ranged from 1.0-51 nM. Compounds with electron-withdrawing substituents at the para- and meta-positions of the B-ring demonstrated the highest AR binding affinity. The AR-mediated transcriptional activation was determined using a cotransfection assay in CV-1 cells. Most compounds with two substituents in the B-ring maintained or improved their functional activity in vitro. However, compounds with three halogen substituents exhibited significant regioselectivity. Fifteen compounds were selected to examine their pharmacological activity in castrated rats. In vivo pharmacological activity and selectivity were significantly changed by structural modification in the B-ring. Compounds with halogen groups at the para- and meta-positions of the B-ring displayed the highest pharmacological activity. Incorporating substituents at the ortho-position of the B-ring resulted in poor pharmacological activity. In vitro and in vivo agonist activities were partially correlated. In conclusion, novel selective androgen receptor modulators with improved in vivo pharmacological activity can be designed and synthesized based on the structure-activity relationship identified in these studies.

With the advent of more sensitive assays, a longitudinal study monitoring the development of TgAb levels after ablative therapy was warranted. Methods: One hundred and twelve consecutive patients with follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer were followed for 3 years. All patients had been thyroidectomized and received, on average, two radioiodine therapies. Residual tissue was quantified scintigraphically by I-131 24-h uptake. TgAb and thyroglobulin (Tg) serum levels were determined with a sensitive direct radioligand assay and an IRMA respectively. Results: The prevalence of TgAbs at the initial examination was 29% (median 130U/ml). During follow-up, TgAb levels rose transiently in one-tenth of the patients. but the prevalence of demonstrable TgAbs decreased to < 10% after 3 years. The median serum half-life of TgAbs in treated DTC patients was 10 weeks. At initial examination (when all patients still had residual thyroid tissue and 17 had metastases), rising TgAb levels were correlated with the inability to detect Tg in 4. 30 and 73%, of the patients, when initial TgAbs were < 6, 6-50 or > 50U/ml respectively. While the Tg recovery test was valid for all patients, an in vitro dilution assay with TgAb serum reduced Tg values by up to 32%. Conclusions: The development and course of TgAbs in DTC patients cannot be predicted by initial or residual tumour volume, TgAb or Tg levels. The presence of TgAbs, even in low concentrations, may cause Tg underestimation despite valid recovery tests in DTC patients.

The canine and human 5-HT2A receptors share 93 % amino acid homology. The canine and human 5-HT2B receptors are also highly conserved (87 % homology) with the exception of the carboxyl termini where the canine protein is 62 amino acids shorter. Both the canine 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors have high affinity for [H-3]5-HT (KD=4.50 +/- 0.89 nM and 3.10 +/- 0.82 nM, respectively) and, in general, the pharmacology of these two receptors matches closely the pharmacology of their human homologs for the 19 serotonergic ligands tested. However, the functional response (Ca2+ mobilization) of the canine 5-HT2B receptor to several agonists was weaker compared to the human 5-HT2B receptor. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, a high expression level of canine 5-HT2A receptor mRNA was detected in the brain and lower levels in peripheral tissues, whereas the highest levels of canine 5-HT2B receptor mRNA were observed in lungs and smooth muscles. A significant level of canine 5-HT2B receptor mRNA was detected in brain tissue. The availability of the full sequence and pharmacology of the canine 5-HT2A and canine 5-HT2B receptors provides useful information for the interpretation of previous and future pharmacological studies of 5-HT2A/2B ligands in dog.

Variable functional responses to U-II, both within and between species studied to date, complicate the characterization of UT antagonists. In the cat, however, U-II causes systemic hypertension and constricts arterial segments isolated from several vascular beds. The purpose of this study was to clone and pharmacologically characterize cat recombinant UT to determine whether this system represents a model for characterizing UT antagonists. Cloned cat UT displayed 74% identity to primate UT, and 77% identity to rodent UT. [125I] hU-II bound in a saturable manner to a single site on recombinant cat UT with high affinity (K-D 288 +/- 13 pM) and high density (B-max 747 +/- 66 fmol/mg protein). U-II isopeptides displayed equipotent, high affinity binding to cat UT (K-i 1.8-5.3 nM). Cat UT was coupled to intracellular [Ca2+] release (EC50 0.6 +/- 0.2 nM) and total mositol phosphate (IP) formation (EC50 0.4 +/- 0.1 nM). Protein kinase C activation desensitized cat, but not human, UT-mediated IP formation. UT mRNA expression was detected in cat blood vessels, trachea, lung, and kidney, where the medulla (KD 815 +/- 34) and cortex and (KD 316 +/- 39 pM) displayed high affinity binding for human U-II (hU-II). The cat urotensin-II receptor represents a suitable in vitro model to examine the role of the U-II/UT system in the etiology of hypertension, assisting in the evaluation of the UT antagonists to help treat cardiovascular disease.

We investigated the structural motifs involved in membrane export of the human pituitary vasopressin V1b/V3 receptor. A series of V3 receptors carrying deletions and point mutations were expressed in AtT20 corticotroph cells. We analyzed the export of these receptors by monitoring radioligand binding and by analysis of a V3 receptor tagged with both green fluorescent protein and Myc epitopes by a novel flow cytometry-based method. This novel method allowed us to quantify total and membrane-bound receptor expression. Receptors lacking the C terminus were not expressed at the cell surface, suggesting the presence of an export motif in this domain. The distal C terminus contains two di-acidic (DXE) ER export motifs; however, mutating both these motifs had no effect on the V3 receptor export. The proximal C terminus contains a di-leucine (LL346)-L-345 motif surrounded by the hydrophobic residues Phe(341), Asn(342), and Leu(350). The mutation of one or more of these five residues abolished up to 100% of the receptor export. In addition, these mutants colocalized with calnexin, demonstrating that they were retained in the ER. Finally, this motif was sufficient to confer export properties on a CD8alpha glycoprotein-V3 receptor chimera. In conclusion, we have identified a novel export motif, FN(X)(2)LL(X)(3)L, in the C terminus of the V3 receptor.

The microinjection of SNP dose-dependently caused significant neural cell death 3 h after infusion, with the area of cell death becoming extensive 24 h after infusion. Neither SIN-1 nor NOC-18, other types of NO donors, caused neural cell death. Together with the result that deferoxamine, an iron-chelating agent, protected SNP-induced brain injury indicated important roles of iron-related radicals in SNP cytotoxicity in rat brain. In vitro [H-3] -NMPB binding was significantly reduced in parallel with the time course of neural cell death detected by TTC staining and Nissl staining. In contrast, [H-3]-flumazenil binding was essentially unaltered during the 24-h period after the SNP infusion. Similar results were observed in in vivo binding experiments. In vivo [H-3]-NMPB binding was found to be much more sensitive at detecting cell death caused by SNP. On the other hand, [H-3]-flumazenil binding in vivo was relatively insensitive to SNP-induced cell death. These results indicate that mAChR binding may be superior to BZR binding for detecting cell death in brain tissue, in contrast to what was previously thought. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Methods: Using in situ radioligand binding with semiquantitative auto radiography I we measured the density of [H-3]MK-801, [H-3]CGP39653, [H-3]AMPA and [H-3]kainate binding in hippocampi, obtained postmortem, from eight subjects with type 1 bipolar disorder and 8 age- and sex-matched controls. Results: In subjects with bipolar disorder there were significant decreases in the density of [H-3]MK-801 binding in the Cornu Ammonis (CA) 3 (mean+/-SEM; 108.8+/-12.2 versus 166.2+/-18.0 fmol/mg ETE, p<0.005) as well as the pyramidal (102.8 +/- 9.2 versus 136.6 +/- 11.2 fmol/mg ETE, p<0.05) and polymorphic (21.73+/-6.5 versus 53.26+/-11.6 fmol/mg ETE, p<0.05) layers of the subiculum. In addition, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed a decrease in the density of [H-3]CGP39653 binding across the hippocampal formation in bipolar subjects, which did not reach significance in any subregion. There were no changes in the densities of [H-3]AMPA or [H-3]kainate binding in these subjects. Conclusions: [H-3]CGP39653 and [H-3]MK-801 bind to the glutamate binding site and open ion channel of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, respectively. Therefore, these data suggest that there is a decrease in the number of open ion channels associated with no significant change in the apparent density of NMDA receptors in regions of the hippocampus from subjects with bipolar disorder.

Results : For static scans acquired in near steady-state, the relative ligand uptake was significantly higher in gray matter structures as compared to the whole brain (ratio : 1.041 +/- 0.06, p = 0.036) whereas it was comparable in white matter (1.010 +/- 0.035). Intersubject reproducibility was 11.4% and 12.9% for white and grey matter Intrasubject reproducibility was of the same order: 14.0% and 14.5% respectively. In two clinically active patients with Gadolinium-positive T1-weighted lesions on MRI the focal ligand uptake was significantly increased (1.36 and 1.14, p = 0.001). In one clinically stable patient, the uptake value corresponding with a T2-weighted MR lesion was not different from normal brain measurements. Conclusion : The current investigations show that normal brain uptake of [C-11]PK11195 is very low and shows the feasibility of a semiquantitative method which can be applied to larger cohorts of patients subgroups.

In the series of diazine analogues of deschloro-UB-165 (DUB-165, 6), bioisosteric replacement of the 3-pyridyl pharmacophoric element by a 4-pyridazinyl, 5-pyrimidinyl, or 2-pyrazinyl moiety resulted in novel nAChR ligands 7, 8, and 9. A palladium-catalyzed Suzuki cross-coupling of the 3-diethylboranylpyridine (14) and a Stille cross-coupling of the corresponding tributylstannyl diazines 15-17 with the vinyl triflate 13 of the N-protected 9-azabicyclo[4.2.1]nonan-2-one 12 constitute the key steps in the syntheses of these enantiopure anatoxinoids 6-9. Studies of the in vitro affinity for (alpha4)(2)(beta2)(3), alpha3beta4*, and alpha7* nAChR subtypes by radioligand binding assays demonstrated that the diazine analogues 7-9 can be considered as pharmacologically attractive bioisosteres of DUB-165 (6) but with different effects on the binding affinity with regard to the diazine moiety. The pyrimidine-containing bioisostere 8 turned out to be the most active diazine analogue, which interacts potently (K-i = 0.14 nM) with the (alpha4)(2)(beta(2))(3) subtype and differentiates significantly among the nAChR subtypes investigated. The nitrogens in this anatoxinoid 8 show by far the most negative atomic charges (calculated using the AM1 Hamiltonian). This qualitatively correlates with the highest binding affinity observed for 8 for all subtypes under consideration.

Epidemiological evidence suggests that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection may be associated with the development of laryngeal cancer. Experimental design: In this report, we have analyzed the prevalence of HPV infection and epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR) expression in a series of 42 laryngeal squamous cell carcinomas by PCR with HPV consensus primers and by a radioligand receptor assay, respectively. Results: HPV DNA was detected in 15 of 42 (35.7%) tumors, and it belonged almost exclusively to the highly oncogenic HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-33 genotypes. At analysis by Mann-Whitney nonparametric statistical test, EGFR level was found to be significantly higher in HPV-infected than in HPV-negative cases (T = 440, P = 0.002). EGFR overexpression (EGFR-positive status >6 fmol/mg protein, the arbitrary cutoff value chosen) was found in 20 of 42 (47.6%) tumors, and it was associated with HPV infection in a statistically significant extent (chi (2) = 4.686, P = 0.03). Conclusions: Viral oncoproteins have been shown to induce a perturbation of the cell response to signals for growth and differentiation; these findings confirm that enhanced EGFR expression and activation in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma may occur also as a consequence of HPV infection and support the hypothesis of an involvement of HPV infection in laryngeal carcinogenesis.

Studies in methamphetamine abusers have also documented significant loss of DA transporters (used as markers of the DA terminal) that are associated with slower motor function and decreased memory. The extent to which the loss of DA transporters predisposes methamphetamine abusers to neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinsonism is unclear and may depend in part on the degree of recovery. Here we assessed the effects of protracted abstinence on the loss of DA transporters in striatum, in methamphetamine abusers using positron emission tomography and [C-11]d-threo-methylphenidate (DA transporter radioligand). Brain DA transporters in five methamphetamine abusers evaluated during short abstinence (<6 months) and then retested during protracted abstinence (12-17 months) showed significant increases with protracted abstinence (caudate, +19%; putamen, +16%). Although performance in some of the tests for which we observed an association with DA transporters showed some improvement, this effect was not significant. The DA transporter increases with abstinence could indicate that methamphetamine-induced DA transporter loss reflects temporary adaptive changes (i.e., downregulation), that the loss reflects DA terminal damage but that terminals can recover, or that remaining viable terminals increase synaptic arborization. Because neuropsychological tests did not improve to the same extent, this suggests that the increase of the DA transporters was not sufficient for complete function recovery. These findings have treatment implications because they suggest that protracted abstinence may reverse some of methamphetamine-induced alterations in brain DA terminals.

During tumor growth PTN can serve as an angiogenic factor and drive tumor invasion and metastasis, To identify a receptor for PTN, we penned a phage display human cDNA library against immobilized PTN protein as a bait. From this we isolated a phage insert that was homologous to an amino acid sequence stretch in the extracellular domain (ECD) of the orphan receptor tyrosine kinase anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), In parallel with PTN, ALK is highly expressed during perinatal development of the nervous system and down-modulated in the adult. Here we show in cell-free assays as well as in radioligand receptor binding studies in intact cells that PTN binds to the ALK ECD with an apparent K-d of 32 +/- 9 pM, This receptor binding is inhibited by an excess of PTN, by the ALK ECD, and by anti-PTN and anti-ECD antibodies. PTN added to ALK-expressing cells induces phosphorylation of both ALK and of the downstream effector molecules IRS-1, She, phospholipase C-gamma, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Furthermore, the growth stimulatory effect of PTN on different cell lines in culture coincides with the endogenous expression of ALK mRNA, and the effect of PTN is enhanced by ALK overexpression. From this we conclude that ALK is a receptor that transduces PTN-mediated signals and propose that the PTN-ALK axis can play a significant role during development and during disease processes.

In this work we investigated whether a glycine receptor (GlyR) was present in golden hamster sperm, and whether it had a role in the hamster AR. The neuronal GlyR agonist glycine, stimulated in a dose-dependent manner, the AR of hamster spermatozoa previously capacitated for at least 3 hr. This stimulation was completely inhibited by 50 muM (+)-bicuculline and by concentrations of strychnine as low as 10-50 nM; both agents are antagonists of neuronal GlyR when used at the concentrations reported in this study. beta -Alanine, another agonist of the neuronal GlyR, also stimulated the AR. The AR-stimulatory effect of this compound was completely abolished by 50 nM strychnine. The inhibitory effect of strychnine on the glycine-induced hamster sperm AR was completely overcome by subsequent treatment with the calcium ionophore ionomycin, demonstrating that the strychnine effect was specific for GlyR. Additional binding studies with (3)[H]-strychnine, the typical radioligand used to detect GlyR in several cells, demonstrated for the first time the presence of specific binding sites for strychnine in the hamster spermatozoa. Interestingly, binding increased during in vitro capacitation, particularly in those sperm suspensions showing high percentages of AR. Taken together these results strongly suggest the presence of a GlyR in the hamster spermatozoa, with a role in the AR when activated. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Almotriptan showed low nanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors in several species, including the human, while affinity for 5-HT receptors other than 5-HT1B/1D was clearly less. Affinity for 5-HT7 and 5-HT1A receptors was approximately 40 and 60 times lower than that for 5-HT1B/1D receptors, respectively. Almotriptan did not exhibit significant affinity for several non-5-HT receptors studied up to 100 muM. Almotriptan inhibited forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation in HeLa cells transfected with 5-HT1B or 5-HT1D human receptors. In this model, almotriptan had the same efficacy as serotonin and an affinity in the low nanomolar range. It induced vasoconstriction in several vessels in which it was compared with sumatriptan. In isolated dog saphenous veins, almotriptan elicited concentration-dependent contractions with an EC50 of 394 nM. In both these systems, almotriptan behaved as a full agonist. Infusion of almotriptan into the porcine meningeal vasculature induced vasoconstriction. In contrast, in the pig renal and rabbit mesenteric arteries, it had a very low maximal efficacy even at 100 muM, with similar results obtained in the rabbit renal artery. The results suggest that almotriptan is a potent and selective 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonist, with selectivity for the cranial vasculature as compared with peripheral vessels.

The receptor domains critical for signaling are unknown. To explore the role of the C terminus, truncations of 63 residues(Tr-406), 53 residues (Tr-416), 49 residues (Tr-420), 44 residues (Tr-424), and 37 residues (Tr-433) were constructed and expressed in NIH/3T3 cells, and immunofluorescence, radioligand binding, adenylyl cyclase (AC) and phospholipase C (PLC) assays were performed. I-125-PACAP-27 binding (K-d = 0.6-1.5 nM) for the Tr-406 and Tr-433 were similar to wild type Hop and Null splice variants (K-d = similar to1.1 nM), Although internalization of ligand for both the Tr-406 and Tr-433 mutants was reduced to 50-60% at 60 min compared with 76-87% for WT, loss of G-protein coupling did not account for differences in internalization. Despite similar binding properties Tr-406 and Tr-416 mutants showed no AC or PLC response. Addition of 14 amino acids distal to HopTr(406) resulted in normal AC and PLC responses. Site-directed mutagenesis indicated that Arg(416) and Ser(417) are essential for G protein activation. The proximal C terminus mediates signal transduction, and the distal is involved with internalization. Two residues within the C terminus, Arg(416) and Ser(417) conserved among class II receptors are the likely sites for G protein coupling.

In many organizations, experimental methods are generated by therapeutic teams associated with specific targets and passed on to the HTS group. The resulting assays frequently need to be further optimized to withstand the rigors and time frames inherent in robotic handling, Issues such as protein aggregation, ligand instability, and cellular viability are common variables in the optimization process, The availability of robotics capable of performing rapid random access tasks has made it possible to design optimization experiments that would be either very difficult or impossible for a person to carry out. Our approach to reducing the assay optimization bottleneck has been to unify the highly specific fields of statistics, biochemistry, and robotics, The product of these endeavors is a process we have named automated assay optimization (AAO). This has enabled us to determine final optimized assay conditions, which are often a composite of variables that we would not have arrived at by examining each variable independently. We have applied this approach to both radioligand binding and enzymatic assays and have realized benefits in both time and performance that we would not have predicted a priori, The fully developed AAO process encompasses the ability to download information to a robot and have liquid handling methods automatically created. This evolution in smart robotics has proven to be an invaluable tool for maintaining high-quality data in the context of increasing NTS demands.

Robalzotan (generic name for NAD-299) is a new putative drug that binds with high selectivity and affinity to 5-HT3A-receptors in the rodent brain in vitro and in vivo. The aim of this positron emission tomography study was to determine 5-HT3A receptor occupancy in the cynomolgus monkey brain in vivo after IV injection of robalzotan. Two healthy monkeys were examine with Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635, the first after IV administration of 2 mu g/kg and 20 mu g/kg, and the second after 10 mu g/kg and 100 mu g/kg IV. 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was calculated using an equilibrium-ratio analysis. Robalzotan occupied 5-HT1A receptors in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. The highest 5-HT1A receptor occupancy (70-80%) was attained after 100 mu g/kg. The relationship between robalzotan drug concentration and 5-HT1A receptor occupancy could be described by a hyperbolic function, which can used to guide the selection of appropriate doses for the initial studies in man. The study further corroborates that quantitative neuroimaging of receptor binding has potentials for the evaluation and dose finding of new CNS drugs.

Arch. Pharm. Pharm. Med. Chem. 1999,332, 39-41). In this paper some novel triazoloquinoxalin-1-ones 4-25 bearing different substituents on the 2-phenyl and/or 4-amino moiety of the parent 4-amino-1,2-dihydro-2-phenyl-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (3) have been synthesized and tested in radioligand binding assays at bovine A(1) and A(2A) and cloned human A(3) adenosine receptors (AR). Moreover, the binding activities at the above-mentioned AR subtypes of the 1,4-dione parent compounds 26-31 and their 5-N-alkyl derivatives 33-37 were also evaluated. The substituent on the 2-phenyl ring exerted a different effect on AR subtypes, while replacement of a hydrogen atom of the 4-amino group with suitable substituents yielded selective A(1) or A(3) antagonists. Replacement of a hydrogen atom of the 4-NH2 with an acyl group, or replacement of the whole 4-NH2 with a 4-oxo moiety, shifted the binding activity toward the A(3) AR. The binding results allowed elucidation of the structural requirements for the binding of these novel tricyclic derivatives at each receptor subtype. In particular, A(1) and A(2A) binding required the presence of a proton donor group at position-4, while for A(3) affinity the presence of a proton acceptor in this same region was of paramount importance.

All major psychiatric disorders are associated with cognitive impairment, but treatment improving cognitive deficits is lacking, partly due to limited understanding of the neurobiology of cognitive functioning. Several markers for the serotonin system have been associated with cognitive functions. Our research group previously has reported a positive correlation between serotonin (5-HT1B) receptor availability in the dorsal brainstem and visuospatial memory in a pilot study of healthy individuals. Here, we aim to replicate our previous finding in a larger group of healthy volunteers as well as to investigate putative associations between 5-HT1B receptor availability and other cognitive domains. Methods Forty-three healthy individuals were examined with positron emission tomography using the 5-HT1B receptor radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 and a visuospatial memory test to replicate our previous finding as well as tests of verbal fluency, cognitive flexibility, reaction time, and planning ability to explore other domains potentially associated with the serotonin system. Results Replication analysis revealed no statistically significant association between 5-HT1B receptor availability in the dorsal brainstem and visuospatial memory performance. Exploratory analyses showed age-adjusted correlations between 5-HT1B receptor availability in whole brain gray matter and specific brain regions, and number of commission errors, reaction time, and planning ability. Conclusions Higher 5-HT1B receptor availability was associated with more false-positive responses and faster reaction time but lower performance in planning and problem-solving. These results corroborate previous research supporting an important role of the serotonin system in impulsive behavior and planning ability.

Therefore, [C-11]UCB-J PET may serve as an in vivo marker of synaptic integrity. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the quantitative accuracy and the 28-day test-retest repeatability (TRT) of various parametric quantitative methods for dynamic [C-11]UCB-J studies in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls (HC). Eight HCs and seven AD patients underwent two 60-min dynamic [C-11]UCB-J PET scans with arterial sampling over a 28-day interval. Several plasma-input based and reference-region based parametric methods were used to generate parametric images using metabolite corrected plasma activity as input function or white matter semi-ovale as reference region. Different parametric outcomes were compared regionally with corresponding non-linear regression (NLR) estimates. Furthermore, the 28-day TRT was assessed for all parametric methods. Spectral analysis (SA) and Logan graphical analysis showed high correlations with NLR estimates. Receptor parametric mapping (RPM) and simplified reference tissue model 2 (SRTM2) BPND, and reference Logan (RLogan) distribution volume ratio (DVR) regional estimates correlated well with plasma-input derived DVR and SRTM BPND. Among the multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM) methods, MRTM1 had the best correspondence with DVR and SRTM BPND. Among the parametric methods evaluated, spectral analysis (SA) and SRTM2 were the best plasma-input and reference tissue methods, respectively, to obtain quantitatively accurate and repeatable parametric images for dynamic [C-11]UCB-J PET.

Whether or not this difference also is present before disease onset and after remission (i.e. a trait), or only at the time of the depressive episode (i.e. a state) remains to be explored. We examined 17 patients with major depressive disorder with positron emission tomography using [C-11]MADAM, a radioligand that binds to the serotonin transporter, before and after treatment with internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy. In all, 17 matched healthy control subjects were examined once. Cerebellum was used as reference to calculate the binding potential. Differences before and after treatment, as well as between patients and controls, were assessed in a composite cerebral region and in the median raphe nuclei. All image analyses and confirmatory statistical tests were preregistered. Depression severity decreased following treatment (p<0.001). [C-11]MADAM binding in patients increased in the composite region after treatment (p=0.01), while no change was observed in the median raphe (p=0.51). No significant difference between patients at baseline and healthy controls were observed in the composite region (p=0.97) or the median raphe (p=0.95). Our main finding was that patients suffering from a depressive episode show an overall increase in cerebral serotonin transporter availability as symptoms are alleviated. Our results suggest that previously reported cross-sectional molecular imaging findings of the serotonin transporter in depression most likely reflect the depressive state, rather than a permanent trait. The finding adds new information on the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.

Their affinity and subtype selectivity with regard to human adenosine A(1)-and A(2A) receptors were determined using radioligand binding assays. K-i values for human A(2A)R ranged from 2.4 to 38 nM, with more than 120-fold selectivity over A(1) receptors for all evaluated compounds except 13k which had a K-i of 361 nM and 18-fold selectivity. The most potent fluorine-containing derivatives 13e, 13g and 13l exhibited K-i values of 4.9 nM, 3.6 nM and 2.8 nM for the human A(2A)R. Interestingly, the corresponding values for rat A(2A)R were found to be four to five times higher. Their binding to A(2A)R was further confirmed by radiolabeling with F-18 and in vitro autoradiography in rat brain slices, which showed almost exclusive striatal binding and complete displacement by the A(2A)R antagonist ZM 241385. We conclude that these compounds represent potential candidates for the visualization of the A(2A) receptor and open pathways to novel therapeutic treatments of neurodegenerative disorders or cancer.

Previously, we characterized porcine cerebral artery responsiveness to intrinsic vasoactive substances. Therefore, here, we investigated dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) cerebral artery responsiveness to 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), histamine (His), angiotensin (Ang) II, acetylcholine (ACh), noradrenaline (NA), and bradykinin (BK) to characterize their related receptor subtypes. We also compared dolphin cerebral artery responsiveness with porcine cerebral artery responsiveness. We found that 5-HT and His induced concentration-dependent contraction of the dolphin cerebral artery. Ketanserin (a 5-HT2 antagonist) and methiothepin (a 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for 5-HT to the right. Although diphenhydramine (an H-1 antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for His to the right, cimetidine (an H-2 antagonist) had no such effect. Ang II and ACh did not produce any vasomotor actions. NA induced concentration-dependent relaxation. Propranolol (a beta antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for NA to the right, whereas phentolamine (an a antagonist) had no significant effect. BK induced relaxation followed by contraction in pre-contracted arteries with intact endothelium. HOE140 (a B-2 antagonist) shifted the concentration-response curve for BK to the right, whereas des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-BK (a B-1 antagonist) had no significant effect. These results suggest that 5-HT1, 5-HT2, and H-1 receptor subtypes are important in arterial contraction and that beta and B-2 receptor subtypes modify these contractions to relaxations. The responsiveness of the dolphin cerebral artery is very similar to that of porcine cerebral artery, supporting their evolutionary linkage.

It is currently insufficiently understood how the dose and biodistribution of(131)I relates to salivary gland toxicity, and whether this is consistent for all salivary glands within a single patient. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) was recently introduced as a new tool to evaluate the relative loss of vital acinar cells in individual salivary glands. We aimed to assess gland-specific salivary gland toxicity after(131)I-therapy using PSMA PET/CT. Methods: Five patients with differentiated thyroid cancer underwent [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT to evaluate their eligibility for peptide radioligand therapy with [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Uptake patterns in salivary glands were evaluated visually and quantitatively as an indicator of vital acinar cell loss after prior(131)I-therapy. Results: Four of 5 patients demonstrated significant lowered uptake in at least one salivary gland, after receiving at least 2(131)I-treatments. Asymmetric loss of vital acinar cells occurred by gland type (parotid/submandibular) and location (right/left). The other salivary glands in these patients and all salivary glands in the fifth patient showed normal uptake, demonstrating high intrapatient and interpatient variability. Conclusions: I-131-therapy can induce salivary gland toxicity with high inter- but also high intrapatient variation among separate gland locations, which can be assessed with PSMA PET/CT. This new technique offers potential to guide further development and evaluation of protective measures in patients receiving(131)I-therapy.

However, recurrent tumor manifestations or metastases cannot be detected in every case. Therefore, we investigated if there is an additive value of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) ligand (68) Ga-RM2 compared to the well-established (68) Ga-PSMA-11 in patients with (Group 1) and without (Group 2) pathologic PSMA-expression in different tumor stages. Patients and Methods Sixteen men (median age: 74 years, range 50-80 years) with prostate cancer in different stages who had a recent negative (n = 8) or pathologic (n = 8) PSMA PET underwent a subsequent (68) Ga-RM2 PET. Both examinations were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared in terms of pathologic and physiologic tracer distribution. Results None of the PSMA-negative patients showed any pathological RM2-accumulation. Pathologic PSMA-uptake was observed in 8 patients of whom 5 had pathologic RM2-uptake. The number of patients with a local recurrence was equal in both scans (n = 3). Bone metastases and lymph node metastases were detected in less patients in RM2 PET compared to PSMA PET (n = 4 vs. 7 and n = 2 vs. 5, respectively). In one patient, PSMA-positive liver metastases were not detected in RM2. RM2 PET revealed two additional lesions indicative for bone metastases in two patients with multiple PSMA-positive bone metastases, which had no therapeutic consequence. Conclusion At least in our small and heterogeneous patient population, (68) Ga-RM2 showed no clinically relevant, additional benefit compared to (68) Ga-PSMA-11 PET.

As insecticides, certain neonicotinoids, i.e., N-nitroguanidine compounds such as imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, are as intrinsically toxic to bees as to the insect pests they target. However, this is not the case for all neonicotinoids, with honeybees orders of magnitude less sensitive to N-cyanoamidine compounds such as thiacloprid [2]. Although previous work has suggested that this is due to rapid metabolism of these compounds [2-5], the specific gene(s) or enzyme(s) involved remain unknown. Here, we show that the sensitivity of the two most economically important bee species to neonicotinoids is determined by cytochrome P450s of the CYP9Q subfamily. Radioligand binding and inhibitor assays showed that variation in honeybee sensitivity to N-nitroguanidine and N-cyanoamidine neonicotinoids does not reside in differences in their affinity for the receptor but rather in divergent metabolism by P450s. Functional expression of the entire CYP3 clade of P450s from honeybees identified a single P450, CYP9Q3, that metabolizes thiacloprid with high efficiency but has little activity against imidacloprid. We demonstrate that bumble bees also exhibit profound differences in their sensitivity to different neonicotinoids, and we identify CYP9Q4 as a functional ortholog of honeybee CYP9Q3 and a key metabolic determinant of neonicotinoid sensitivity in this species. Our results demonstrate that bee pollinators are equipped with biochemical defense systems that define their sensitivity to insecticides and this knowledge can be leveraged to safeguard bee health.

New hydantoin derivatives (4-19) were designed and synthesized. For 5-pheny1-3-(2-hydroxy-3-(4-(2-ethoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (4), its crystal structure was determined experimentally. Molecular modeling studies were performed, including both pharmacophore and structure-based approaches. New compounds were investigated in radioligand binding assays (RBA) for their affinity toward 5-HT7R and selectivity over 5-HT1AR, dopamine D2R and alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-and beta-adrenoceptors. Selected compounds (5-8) were assessed for their antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in vivo in mice. Most of the tested compounds displayed potent affinity and selectivity for 5-HT7R in RBA, in particular seven compounds (4, 5, 7, 8 and 10-12, K-i <= 10 nM). Antidepressant-like activity in vivo for all tested compounds (5-8) was confirmed.

For example, extraction of regional dynamic time series from brain PET images requires parcellation procedures that benefit from being automated. Comparison with existing methods: Manual inter-modality spatial normalization to a MRI atlas is operator dependent, time-consuming, and can be inaccurate with lack of cortical radiotracer binding or skull uptake. New method: A parcellated PET template that allows for automatic spatial normalization to PET images of any radiotracer. Results: MRI and [C-11]Cimbi-36 PET scans obtained in sixteen pigs made the basis for the atlas. The high resolution MRI scans allowed for creation of an accurately averaged MRI template. By aligning the within subject PET scans to their MRI counterparts, an averaged PET template was created in the same space. We developed an automatic procedure for spatial normalization of the averaged PET template to new PET images and hereby facilitated transfer of the atlas regional parcellation. Evaluation of the automatic spatial normalization procedure found the median voxel displacement to be 0.22 +/- 0.08 mm using the MRI template with individual MRI images and 0.92 +/- 0.26 mm using the PET template with individual [C-11]Cimbi-36 PET images. We tested the automatic procedure by assessing eleven PET radiotracers with different kinetics and spatial distributions by using perfusion-weighted images of early PET time frames. Conclusion: We here present an automatic procedure for accurate and reproducible spatial normalization and parcellation of pig PET images of any radiotracer with reasonable blood-brain barrier penetration.

DFMC (1) was shown to have high binding affinity (IC50: 6.1 nM) for FAAH. [C-11]1 was synthesized by C-C-11 coupling reaction of arylboronic ester 2 with [C-11]methyl iodide in the presence of Pd catalyst. At the end of synthesis, [C-11]1 was obtained with a radiochemical yield of 20 +/- 10% (based on [C-11]CO2, decay-corrected, n = 5) and specific activity of 48-166 GBq/lmol. After the injection of [C-11]1 in mice, high uptake of radioactivity (>2% ID/g) was distributed in the lung, liver, kidney, and brain, organs with high FAAH expression. PET images of rat brains for [C-11]1 revealed high uptakes in the cerebellar nucleus (SUV = 2.4) and frontal cortex (SUV = 2.0), two known brain regions with high FAAH expression. Pretreatment with the FAAH-selective inhibitor URB597 reduced the brain uptake. Higher than 90% of the total radioactivity in the rat brain was irreversible at 30 min after the radioligand injection. The present results indicate that [C-11]1 is a promising PET ligand for imaging of FAAH in living brain. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In animal models, treatment with a TGR5 agonist induces incretin secretion to reduce hyperglycemia. Betulinic acid, a triterpenoid present in the leaves of white birch, has been introduced as a selective TGR5 agonist. However, direct activation of TGR5 by betulinic acid has not yet been reported. Methods: Transfection of TGR5 into cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells was performed to establish the presence of TGR5. Additionally, TGR5-specific small interfering RNA was employed to silence TGR5 in cells ( NCI-H716 cells) that secreted incretins. Uptake of glucose by CHO-K1 cells was evaluated using a fluorescent indicator. Amounts of cyclic adenosine monophosphate and glucagon-like peptide were quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Results: Betulinic acid dose-dependently increases glucose uptake by CHO-K1 cells transfected with TGR5 only, which can be considered an alternative method instead of radioligand binding assay. Additionally, signals coupled to TGR5 activation are also increased by betulinic acid in cells transfected with TGR5. In NCI-H716 cells, which endogenously express TGR5, betulinic acid induces glucagon-like peptide secretion via increasing calcium levels. However, the actions of betulinic acid were markedly reduced in NCI-H716 cells that received TGR5-silencing treatment. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the activation of TGR5 by betulinic acid for the first time. Conclusion: Similar to the positive control lithocholic acid, which is the established agonist of TGR5, betulinic acid has been characterized as a useful agonist of TGR5 and can be used to activate TGR5 in the future.

The aim of this initial methodological study was to develop a plasma input tracer kinetic model for quantification of [F-18] DPA-714 binding in healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and to provide a preliminary assessment whether there is a disease-related signal. Ten AD patients and six healthy subjects underwent a dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) study along with arterial sampling and a scan protocol of 150 minutes after administration of 250 +/- 10 MBq [F-18] DPA-714. The model that provided the best fits to tissue time activity curves (TACs) was selected based on Akaike Information Criterion and F-test. The reversible two tissue compartment plasma input model with blood volume parameter was the preferred model for quantification of [F-18] DPA-714 kinetics, irrespective of scan duration, volume of interest, and underlying volume of distribution (V-T). Simplified reference tissue model (SRTM)-derived binding potential (BPND) using cerebellar gray matter as reference tissue correlated well with plasma input-based distribution volume ratio (DVR). These data suggest that [F-18] DPA-714 cannot be used for separating individual AD patients from heathy subjects, but further studies including TSPO binding status are needed to substantiate these findings.

Methods: The studies were performed on male rats. The changes in nociceptive thresholds were determined by using mechanical stimuli (the Randall-Selitto and the von Frey tests). Diabetes was induced by intramuscular administration of streptozotocin. In order to investigate the mechanism of interaction, animals were also pretreated with naloxone (NLX), a nonselective opioid antagonist, yohimbine (YOH), a nonselective alpha(2)-adrenergic antagonist, and p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), a neurotoxin that destroys serotonergic neurons. The mu-opioid receptors' density was determined with the use of radioligand binding assay. Results: VFX potentiated antinociceptive action of MRF after acute administration of VFX and this effect was decreased by pretreatment of NLX, YOH and PCA. On the contrary, VFX administered for 21 days prior to MRF significantly decreased the analgesic action of MRF; this effect was augmented only after YOU pretreatment. Also, 21-days administration of VFX caused decreasing tendency in the number of mu-opioid receptors in the brain stem. Conclusions: The results of our study show that single administration of VFX potentiates antinociceptive action of morphine in DNPM. This effect is probably mediated by both, noradrenergic and serotonergic systems. On the other hand, 21-days administration of VFX significantly decreases analgesic action of MRF. Moreover, there is a possibility that VFX acts as an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors. (C) 2014 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

However, the mechanisms have not been fully explored. The serotonin transporter protein (5-HTT) regulates synaptic concentrations of serotonin and is a primary target for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The aim of this study was to explore how estrogen treatment alone or in combination with testosterone affects 5-HTT binding potentials measured by positron emission tomography (PET) in specific brain regions of postmenopausal women. Ten healthy surgically postmenopausal women (years since oophorectomy 7.5 +/- 4.0, mean +/- SD) underwent PET examinations at baseline, after three months of estrogen treatment (transdermal estradiol 100 mu g/24 hours) and after another three months of combined estrogen and testosterone (testosterone undecanoate 40 mg daily) treatment using the radioligand [C-11] MADAM developed for examination of the serotonin transporter. The 5-HTT binding potentials decreased significantly in several cortical regions, as well as in limbic and striatal regions after both estrogen treatment alone and combined estrogen/testosterone treatment in comparison to baseline. The observed decrease in 5-HTT could either be due to direct effects on serotonin transporter expression or be the result of indirect adaptation to estrogen and/or testosterone effects on synaptic serotonin levels. Although the mechanism still needs further exploration, the study supports the view that gonadal hormones play a role in serotonin regulated mood disorders. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Dual effects of α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptors in modulating myogenic tone in sheep isolated internal anal sphincter	NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY			English	Article						fecal incontinence; imidazoline; radioligand binding	ALPHA-ADRENOCEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; MEDIATING CONTRACTIONS; RESTING PRESSURE; SAPHENOUS-VEIN; BRIMONIDINE; LOFEXIDINE; CLONIDINE; RESPONSES; IDAZOXAN	Background The role of alpha-adrenoceptors in promoting continence through modulation of sphincter tone has focused primarily on the effects of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. We have used three clinically available agents, which are selective for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, to investigate their role in contractile and neurogenic responses on the internal anal sphincter (IAS). Methods IAS strips, which had spontaneously generated tone, were used to investigate the contractile effect of lofexidine, brimonidine, and dexmedetomidine on muscle tone in the presence or absence of subtype selective antagonists. The effect of brimonidine on the magnitude and time course of neurogenic responses generated by electrical field stimulation (EFS) was also examined. The affinity of test compounds at alpha(1)- and alpha(2)-adrenoceptors was established by competition binding with [3H]-prazosin and [3H]-RX821002. Key Results All agonists caused concentration-dependent contraction of the IAS and lofexidine demonstrated an enantiomeric difference in potency with a 10-fold difference between the (-) and (+) isomers. Responses to lofexidine and dexmedetomidine were inhibited in the presence of the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor selective antagonist prazosin, but not in the presence of RX811059 (alpha(2)-adrenoceptor selective antagonist); brimonidine responses were inhibited by RX811059 and, to a lesser extent, by prazosin. Brimonidine affected both magnitude and duration of neurogenic responses, which was reversed in the presence of RX811059. Conclusions & Inferences We conclude that alpha(2)-adrenoceptors can mediate contraction of IAS, although this effect is most evident with efficacious imidazoline agonists rather than the most selective ligand. In addition, this receptor subtype can directly inhibit noradrenergic contractile responses to EFS and, indirectly, enhance nitrergic relaxatory responses.	[Rayment, S. J.; Simpson, J. A.

A virtual docking experiment showed almost perfect fit of one of the 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) derivatives, 6a, into a crystallographically identified receptor NTSR1 (Fig.1). The affinities for the receptors of the NTS analogs and derivatives are low, when determined with cell-membrane homogenates, while, with NTSR1-exhibiting cancer tissues, affinities in the single-digit nanomolar range can be observed (Table2). Most of the -amino acid-containing NTS(8-13) analogs (Table1 and Fig.2), including the Ga-68 complexes of the DOTA-substituted ones (6; Figs.2 and 5), are stable for ca. 1h in human serum and plasma, and in murine plasma. The biodistributions of two Ga-68 complexes (of 6a and 6b) in HT29 tumor-bearing nude mice, in the absence and in the presence of a blocking compound, after 10, 30, and 60min (Figs.3 and 4) lead to the conclusion that the amount of specifically bound radioligand is rather low. This was confirmed by PET-imaging experiments with the tumor-bearing mice (Fig.6). Comparison of the in vitro plasma stability (after 1h) with the ex vivo blood content (after 10-15min) of the two Ga-68 complexes shows that they are rapidly cleaved in the animals (Fig.5).

This broad spectrum of efficacy was not predicted from the preclinical pharmacology of quetiapine. Binding studies in vitro show that quetiapine and its major active human metabolite, norquetiapine, have moderate to high affinity for dopamine D-2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, while norquetiapine alone has high affinity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET). This positron emission tomography (PET) study measured NET occupancy in human subjects treated with extended-release quetiapine (quetiapine XR) at doses relevant in the treatment of depression. PET measurements using the specific NET radioligand (S,S)-(F-18]FMeNER-D-2 were performed before and after quetiapirte XR. treatment at 150 and 300 mg/d for 6-8 d in nine healthy males (aged 21-33 yr). Regions of interest were defined for the thalamus, using the caudate as reference region. NET occupancy was calculated using a target:reference region ratio method. Plasma concentrations of quetiapine and norquetiapine were monitored during PET measurements. Following quetiapine XR treatment, the mean NET occupancy in the thalamus was 19 and 35%, respectively, at quetiapine XR doses of 150 and 300 mg/d. The estimated plasma concentration of norquetiapine corresponding to 50% NET occupancy was 161 ng/ml. This is the first demonstration of NET occupancy by an antipsychotic in the human brain. NET inhibition is accepted as a mechanism of antidepressant activity. NET occupancy may therefore contribute to the broad spectrum of efficacy of quetiapine.

The pathophysiology of spasmodic dysphonia is thought to involve structural and functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitry; however, neurochemical correlates underpinning these abnormalities as well as their relations to spasmodic dysphonia symptoms remain unknown. We used positron emission tomography with the radioligand [C-11]raclopride (RAC) to study striatal dopaminergic neurotransmission at the resting state and during production of symptomatic sentences and asymptomatic finger tapping in spasmodic dysphonia patients. We found that patients, compared to healthy controls, had bilaterally decreased RAC binding potential (BP) to striatal dopamine D-2/D-3 receptors on average by 29.2%, which was associated with decreased RAC displacement (RAC Delta BP) in the left striatum during symptomatic speaking (group average difference 10.2%), but increased RAC Delta BP in the bilateral striatum during asymptomatic tapping (group average difference 10.1%). Patients with more severe voice symptoms and subclinically longer reaction time to initiate the tapping sequence had greater RAC Delta BP measures, while longer duration of spasmodic dysphonia was associated with a decrease in task-induced RAC Delta BP. Decreased dopaminergic transmission during symptomatic speech production may represent a disorder-specific pathophysiological trait involved in symptom generation, whereas increased dopaminergic function during unaffected task performance may be explained by a compensatory adaptation of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system possibly due to decreased striatal D-2/D-3 receptor availability. These changes can be linked to the clinical and subclinical features of spasmodic dysphonia and may represent the neurochemical basis of basal ganglia alterations in this disorder.

The major drawback of C-11 tracers is the lack of cyclotron facility in many health care centers thereby limiting widespread clinical or research use. We identified the fluoroethyl derivative, 2-(4-(4-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)piperazin-l-yl)buty1)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine3,5(2H,4H)dione (FECUMI-101) (K-i = 0.1 nM; E-max = 77%; EC50 = 0.65 nM) as a partial agonist 5-HT1AR ligand of the parent ligand CUM1-101. FECUMI-101 is radiolabeled with F-18 by O-fluoroethylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue (1) with [F-18]fluoroethyltosylate in DMSO in the presence of 1.6 equiv of K2CO3 in 45 +/- 5% yield (EOS). PET shows [F-18]FECUMI-101 binds specifically to 5-HT1AR enriched brain regions of baboon. The specificity of [F-18]FECUMI-101 binding to 5-HT1AR was confirmed by challenge studies with the known 5-HT1AR ligand WAY100635. These findings indicate that [F-18]FECUM1-101 can be a viable agonist ligand for the in vivo quantification of high affinity 5-HT1AR with PET. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Modulation of G protein-coupled adenosine receptors by strategically functionalized agonists and antagonists immobilized on gold nanoparticles	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						G protein-coupled receptor; Nanoparticle; Nucleoside; Adenosine; Radioligand binding	QUANTUM DOTS; TUMOR-GROWTH; TARGETS; CELLS; SIZE	Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) allow the tuning of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties by active or passive targeting of drugs for cancer and other diseases. We have functionalized gold nanoparticles by tethering specific ligands, agonists and antagonists, of adenosine receptors (ARs) to the gold surface as models for cell surface interactions with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The AuNP conjugates with chain-extended AR ligands alone (PEGylated nucleosides and nonnucleosides, anchored to the Au via thioctic acid) were found to be insoluble in water due to hydrophobic entities in the ligand. Therefore, we added a second, biologically inactive pendant moiety to increase the water solubility, consisting of a PEGylated chain terminating in a carboxylic or phosphate group. The purity and stability of the immobilized biologically active ligand were examined by ultrafiltration and HPLC. Pharmacological receptor binding studies on these GPCR ligand-derivatized AuNPs (2-5 nm in diameter), performed using membranes of mammalian cells stably expressing human A(1), A(2A), and A(3)ARs, showed that the desired selectivity was retained with K (i) values (nanomolar) of A(3)AR agonist 21b and A(2A)AR antagonists 24 and 26a of 14 (A(3)), 34 (A(2A)), and 69 (A(2A)), respectively. The corresponding monomers displayed K (i) values of 37, 61, and 1,420 nM, respectively. In conclusion, we have synthesized stable, water-soluble AuNP derivatives of tethered A(3) and A(2A)AR ligands that retain the biological properties of their monomeric ligands and are intended for therapeutic and imaging applications. This is the first prototypical application to gold carriers of small molecule (nonpeptide) GPCR ligands, which are under investigation for treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases.

Spinal microglial activation in rat models of neuropathic and osteoarthritic pain: An autoradiographic study using [3H]PK11195	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; EXPERIMENTAL AUTOIMMUNE ENCEPHALOMYELITIS; PROTEIN 18 KDA; NERVE-INJURY; IN-VIVO; FOREBRAIN ISCHEMIA; GLIAL ACTIVATION; BINDING-SITES; EXPRESSION; INFLAMMATION	Background Microglia serve as macrophage-like cells in the central nervous system, and activation of microglial cells in the spinal cord may contribute to ongoing pain following peripheral trauma or nerve injury. Following pronociceptive stimulation, activated microglia exhibit increased expression of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR)/translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO). Methods Using radioligand binding autoradiography and filtration assays, we examined the specific binding of the PBR/TSPO ligand [3H]PK11195 in spinal cords from the following rat experimental pain models: neuropathic pain induced by spinal nerve ligation (SNL), osteoarthritic pain induced by intraarticular injection of monosodium iodoacetate in the knee joint (MIA-OA), and subchronic inflammatory pain induced by intraplantar injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). Results Specific [3H]PK11195 binding in dorsal and ventral regions of lumbar spinal cord was increased by 70% ipsilateral to SNL. Also, specific [3H]PK11195 binding in the ipsilateral (injured) lumbar spinal cord was increased by approximately 25% in MIA-OA. In contrast to the data obtained in these chronic neuropathic and nociceptive pain models, specific [3H]PK11195 binding in the ipsilateral (injured) dorsal horn was elevated in only one of six CFA rats. Consistent with increased PBR/TSPO binding measured for SNL and MIA-OA rats, increased anti-OX-42 immunostaining of the cell surface microglial marker CD11b was observed in the ipsilateral spinal cord from these models. Conclusions These studies demonstrate that [3H]PK11195 binding assays may serve as a marker of spinal microglial activation in experimental models of chronic neuropathic or osteoarthritic pain, which may be translatable to clinical research through novel applications of PBR/TSPO imaging agents.

For visualization of NET abundance and deregulation, a novel PET tracer - [C-11]Me@APPI - has been developed. Methods: For precursor synthesis, a 4-step synthesis starting from N-phenyl-o-phenylenediamine was set up. Radiosynthesis was established and optimized using standard methods and subsequently automated in a GE TRACERlabFx C Pro synthesizer. Preclinical testing was performed comprising affinity and selectivity testing on human membranes as well as stability and blood-brain-barrier-penetration using in-vitro models. Results: Precursor molecule (APPI:0) and reference compound (Me@APPI) were synthesized with 26.5% and 21.4% overall yield, respectively. So far, 1.25 +/- 0.72 GBq [C-11]Me@APPI with 54.35 +/- 7.80 GBq/mu mol specific activity were produced (n=11). Affinity of reference compounds was determined as 8.08 +/- 1.75 nM for Me@APPI and 19.31 +/- 2.91 nM for APPI:0, respectively (n >= 9). IAM-chromatography experiments (n=3) revealed a Pm value of 1.51 +/- 0.34 for Me@APPI. Stability testing using human liver microsomes revealed that 99.5% of the tracer was found to be still intact after 60 minutes (n=4). Conclusion: Present data indicate that [C-11]Me@APPI has promising properties to become a clinically useful NET-PET-tracer. Further in-vitro and in-vivo evaluations are currently under way.

Methylphenidate-Elicited Dopamine Increases in Ventral Striatum Are Associated with Long-Term Symptom Improvement in Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article							DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; RATING-SCALES; HUMAN BRAIN; PART II; TRANSPORTER; BINDING	Stimulant medications, such as methylphenidate, which are effective treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), enhance brain dopamine signaling. However, the relationship between regional brain dopamine enhancement and treatment response has not been evaluated. Here, we assessed whether the dopamine increases elicited by methylphenidate are associated with long-term clinical response. We used a prospective design to study 20 treatment-naive adults with ADHD who were evaluated before treatment initiation and after 12 months of clinical treatment with a titrated regimen of oral methylphenidate. Methylphenidate-induced dopamine changes were evaluated with positron emission tomography and [C-11]raclopride (D-2/D-3 receptor radioligand sensitive to competition with endogenous dopamine). Clinical responses were assessed using the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale and revealed a significant reduction in symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity with long-term methylphenidate treatment. A challenge dose of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous methylphenidate significantly increased dopamine in striatum (assessed as decreases in D-2/D-3 receptor availability). In the ventral striatum, these dopamine increases were associated with the reductions in ratings of symptoms of inattention with clinical treatment. Statistical parametric mapping additionally showed dopamine increases in prefrontal and temporal cortices with intravenous methylphenidate that were also associated with decreases in symptoms of inattention. Our findings indicate that dopamine enhancement in ventral striatum (the brain region involved with reward and motivation) was associated with therapeutic response to methylphenidate, further corroborating the relevance of the dopamine reward/motivation circuitry in ADHD. It also provides preliminary evidence that methylphenidate-elicited dopamine increases in prefrontal and temporal cortices may also contribute to the clinical response.

Altered Gene Expression in Pulmonary Tissue of Tryptophan Hydroxylase-1 Knockout Mice: Implications for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension	PLOS ONE			English	Article							5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE TRANSPORTER GENE; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; PLASMA SEROTONIN; CARDIAC-FUNCTION; TRANSGENIC MICE; CHRONIC HYPOXIA; DEXFENFLURAMINE; FENFLURAMINE; RECEPTORS	The use of fenfluramines can increase the risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in humans, but the mechanisms responsible are unresolved. A recent study reported that female mice lacking the gene for tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph1(-/-) mice) were protected from PAH caused by chronic dexfenfluramine, suggesting a pivotal role for peripheral serotonin (5-HT) in the disease process. Here we tested two alternative hypotheses which might explain the lack of dexfenfluramine-induced PAH in Tph1(-/-) mice. We postulated that: 1) Tph1(-/-) mice express lower levels of pulmonary 5-HT transporter (SERT) when compared to wild-type controls, and 2) Tph1(-/-) mice display adaptive changes in the expression of non-serotonergic pulmonary genes which are implicated in PAH. SERT was measured using radioligand binding methods, whereas gene expression was measured using microarrays followed by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR). Contrary to our first hypothesis, the number of pulmonary SERT sites was modestly up-regulated in female Tph1(-/-) mice. The expression of 51 distinct genes was significantly altered in the lungs of female Tph1(-/-) mice. Consistent with our second hypothesis, qRT-PCR confirmed that at least three genes implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH were markedly up-regulated: Has2, Hapln3 and Retlna. The finding that female Tph1(-/-) mice are protected from dexfenfluramine-induced PAH could be related to compensatory changes in pulmonary gene expression, in addition to reductions in peripheral 5-HT. These observations emphasize the intrinsic limitation of interpreting data from studies conducted in transgenic mice that are not fully characterized.

Compound [F-18]7a was synthesized by [F-18] fluorination of 6-[1-(2-bromo-3-pyridyl)-5-methyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl] quinoline (7b) with potassium [F-18] fluoride. At the end of synthesis, 1280-1830 MBq (n = 8) of [F-18]7a was obtained with >98% radiochemical purity and 118-237 GBq/mu mol specific activity using 3300-4000 MBq of [F-18]F . In vitro autoradiography showed that [F-18]7a had high specific binding with mGluR1 in the rat brain. Biodistribution study using a dissection method and small-animal PET showed that [F-18]7a had high uptake in the rat brain. The uptake of radioactivity in the cerebellum was reduced by unlabeled 7a and mGluR1-selective ligand JNJ-16259685 (2), indicating that [F-18]7a had in vivo specific binding with mGluR1. Because of a low amount of radiolabeled metabolite present in the brain, [F-18]7a may have a limiting potential for the in vivo imaging of mGluR1 by PET. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Traditional oil bath heating was compared to microwave heating. Various radioanalytical methods, radio-Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), High Pressure Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry (MS), were compared in the evaluation of the labelled product(s). The crude reaction mixture consisted of p-[F-18]MPPF and 2-4 radioactive by-products eluting after the product fraction, and the reverse-phase HPLC method failed occasionally to separate p-[F-18]MPPF from the radioactive by-product with close retention time. The heating method had no significant effect on the composition of labelled by-products. In LC-(ESI)-MS analysis of p-[F-18]MPPF the labelled product was identified with m/z ratio of 435 ([M + H+]). The other HPLC fractions were measured to have following m/z ratios: (1) 327; 349; (675) (2) 402; 407/408; (791) and (3) 436, suggesting different kind of decomposition of the labelled product and/or the inactive precursor. The ion trap mass spectrometer was sufficient for the qualitative analysis of p-[F-18]MPPF. However, differentiation of by-products arising from the decomposition of p-[F-18]MPPF or from its precursor p-MPPNO2 proved to be challenging.

JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						C-11-meta-hydroxyephedrine; norepinephrine reuptake; sympathetic innervation; cardiac imaging; small-animal PET	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO; PERFORMANCE EVALUATION; SMALL ANIMALS; HEART; CARDIOMYOPATHY; RESOLUTION; REUPTAKE; CAMERA; RAT	Dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system underlies many cardiac diseases and can be assessed by molecular imaging using PET in humans. Small-animal PET should enable non-invasive quantitation of the sympathetic nervous system in mouse models of human disease. For mice, however, the radioactivity needed to give acceptable image quality may be associated with a mass of unlabeled compound sufficient to block the binding of radioligand to its target. The present study assesses the feasibility of using [N-methyl-C-11]metahydroxyephedrine (C-11-mHED) to measure norepinephrine reuptake in humans, to determine cardiac innervation in mice. Methods: Anesthetized mice were placed in a small-animal PET scanner. C-11-mHED (containing 18% precursor metaraminol) was injected via a tail vein into each animal simultaneously. Fifteen minutes later, animals were injected with saline or metaraminol which competes with mHED for norepinephrine reuptake. F-18-FDG was injected at 60 min to identify heart regions. After reconstruction of the list-mode data, radioactivity in myocardial regions was computed using in-house software, and time-activity curves were plotted. Results: Hearts were clearly visualized after injection of C-11-mHED. Injection of metaraminol at doses less than 50 nmol.kg(-1) had no effect, whereas doses greater than 100 nmol.kg(-1) caused a dose-dependent loss of specifically bound radioactivity. Conclusion: C-11-mHED was successfully used to visualize and assess myocardial innervation in mice. Uptake of C-11-mHED is displaceable by the false transmitter metaraminol. The total molar dose of metaraminol and C-11-mHED must be considered in the analysis of PET data.

To date, the neonicotinoids, an economically important class of insecticides that target nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), have remained an effective control measure; however, recent reports of resistance in M. persicae represent a threat to the long-term efficacy of this chemical class. In this study, the mechanisms underlying resistance to the neonicotinoid insecticides were investigated using biological, biochemical, and genomic approaches. Bioassays on a resistant M. persicae clone (5191A) suggested that P450-mediated detoxification plays a primary role in resistance, although additional mechanism(s) may also contribute. Microarray analysis, using an array populated with probes corresponding to all known detoxification genes in M. persicae, revealed constitutive over-expression (22-fold) of a single P450 gene (CYP6CY3); and quantitative PCR showed that the over-expression is due, at least in part, to gene amplification. This is the first report of a P450 gene amplification event associated with insecticide resistance in an agriculturally important insect pest. The microarray analysis also showed over-expression of several gene sequences that encode cuticular proteins (2-16-fold), and artificial feeding assays and in vivo penetration assays using radiolabeled insecticide provided direct evidence of a role for reduced cuticular penetration in neonicotinoid resistance. Conversely, receptor radioligand binding studies and nucleotide sequencing of nAChR subunit genes suggest that target-site changes are unlikely to contribute to resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides in M. persicae.

Translocator protein (18 kDa) mediates the pro-growth effects of diazepam on Ehrlich tumor cells <i>in vivo</i>	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						TSPO; Ehrlich cell; Diazepam; Cancer; Benzodiazepine; Anxiety	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; HUMAN BREAST-CANCER; CHROMOSOMAL LOCALIZATION; CHOLESTEROL BINDING; OXIDATIVE STRESS; PROLIFERATION; PBR; EXPRESSION; VITRO; MICE	The Translocator Protein (TSPO), previously known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is a ubiquitous drug- and cholesterol-binding protein that is up regulated in several types of cancer cells. TSPO drug ligands (e.g., diazepam) induce or inhibit tumor cell proliferation, depending on the dose and tissue origin. We have previously shown that TSPO is expressed in Ehrlich tumor cells and that diazepam increases proliferation of these cells in vitro. Here, we investigated the in vivo effects of diazepam on Ehrlich tumor growth and the role of TSPO in mediating this process. Oral administration of diazepam to mice (3.0 mg/kg/day for 7 days) produced plasma and ascitic fluid drug concentrations of 83.83 and 54.12 nM, respectively. Diazepam increased Ehrlich tumor growth, likely due to its ability to increase tumor cell proliferation and Reactive Oxygen Species production. Radioligand binding assays and nucleotide sequencing revealed that Ehrlich tumor cell TSPO had the same pharmacological and biochemical properties as TSPO described in other tumor cells. The estimated K-d for PK 11195 in Ehrlich tumor cells was 0.44 nM and 8.70 nM (low and high binding site, respectively). Structurally diverse TSPO drug ligands with exclusive affinity for TSPO (i.e., 4-chlordiazepam, Ro5-4864, and isoquinoline-carboxamide PK 11195) also increased Ehrlich tumor growth. However, clonazepam, a GABA(A)-specific ligand with no affinity for TSPO, failed to do so. Taken together, these data suggest that diazepam induces in vivo Ehrlich tumor growth in a TSPO-dependent manner. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our goal was to relate B12 levels to AD symptoms and to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Clinical manifestations were investigated for a case series of fifty-five outpatients using the MMSE, Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CDDS). Plasma B12 levels were measured by radioligand binding assay. Basal and PMA-stimulated levels of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 were measured by ELISPOT (PBMC culture supernatant). 47 patients were genotyped for APOE. Ten patients (18%) had their B12 levels below <250 pg/ml. They did not statistically differ from those 45 who had normal levels in most demographic and clinical features; their MMSE scores were lower (14.7 vs 19.6 p = 0.03) but not after adjustment for disease duration. A greater basal production of IL-6 was reported in patients who had low B12 levels compared to normal B12 subjects (1333 pg/ml vs 976 p < 0.01); this association was confirmed after controlling for age of onset and APOE genotype. In conclusion, low B12 level is associated with greater production of IL-6 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Further research is warranted to elucidate whether this neuroinflammatory effect of cobalamin is implicated in the pathophysiology of AD.

The latter must be metabolically activated and binds irreversibly to P2Y(12) for the life of the platelet, precluding restoration of hemostatic function without the generation of new platelets. In in vitro studies comparing binding characteristics of ticagrelor and compound 105, a chemical compound indistinguishable from the active metabolite of prasugrel, ticagrelor exhibited 1) an approximately 100-fold higher affinity for P2Y(12) and rapid achievement of equilibrium (vs no equilibrium reached with compound 105) as assessed by radioligand displacement in a receptor filtration binding assay, 2) 48-fold greater potency in a functional receptor assay using recombinant human P2Y(12), and 3) 63-fold greater potency in inhibiting ADP-induced aggregation in washed human platelets. In rat and dog models of thrombosis/hemostasis, there was greater separation between doses that provided antithrombotic effect and those that increased bleeding for ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel and compound 072, a chemical compound indistinguishable from the prasugrel parent compound. The ratio of dose resulting in 3-fold increase in bleeding time to dose resulting in 50% restoration of blood flow in rats was 9.7 for ticagrelor compared with 2.0 for clopidogrel and 1.4 for compound 072. Similar results were observed in dogs. Our findings suggest that reversibility of P2Y(12) binding with ticagrelor may account for the greater separation between antithrombotic effects and increased bleeding compared with the irreversible binding of clopidogrel and prasugrel.

Design: This was a mechanistic study conducted in the same individuals of luteinizing hormone pulsatility with a saline/naloxone challenge (n = 6) and positron emission tomography with [C-11]carfentanil, a selective mu-opioid receptor radioligand (n = 5), before and after 12 weeks of unblinded treatment with a popular BC daily supplement. Results: BC treatment for 12 weeks at a standard dose (Remifemin, 40 mg/day) had no effect on spontaneous luteinizing hormone pulsatility or estrogen concentrations. With naloxone blockade, there was an unexpected suppression of mean luteinizing hormone pulse frequency (saline vs naloxone = 9,0 +/- 0.6 vs 6.0 +/- 0.7 pulses/16 h; P = 0.056), especially during sleep when the mean interpulse interval was prolonged by approximately 90 minutes (saline night interpulse interval = 103 +/- 9 min vs naloxone night interpulse interval = 191 +/- 31 min, P = 0.03). There were significant increases in mu-opioid receptor binding potential in the posterior and subgenual cingulate, temporal and orbitofrontal cortex, thalamus, and nucleus accumbens ranging from 10% to 61% across brain regions involved in emotional and cognitive function. In contrast, binding potential reductions of lesser magnitude were observed in regions known to be involved in the placebo response (anterior cingulate and anterior insular cortex). Conclusions: Using two different challenge paradigms for the examination of central opioid function, a neuropharmacologic action of BC treatment was demonstrated in postmenopausal women.

They participate in synaptic plasticity, memory and learning, Alzheimer's disease, and certain drug reward. Some mechanisms behind these effects are thought to be nongenomic, e. g., they modulate the function of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor complex. In this study, we used a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably transfected with NMDA receptor constituents NR1/NR2B, to investigate the effects of nanomolar concentrations of the neurosteroids pregnenolone sulfate (PS) and pregnanolone sulfate (3 alpha 5 beta S) on binding of the radioligand [H-3] ifenprodil. Neither of the steroids displaced [H-3] ifenprodil, but both induced a shift in its fit from one to two binding sites. The effects of the neurosteroids were also measured as changes in intracellular calcium ([Ca2+](i)) after glutamate stimulation. Although the steroids did not alter the response to glutamate, they influenced the extent of ifenprodil blockade of the receptor: PS increased and 3 alpha 5 beta S decreased this effect. The coincubation of several NMDA receptor ligands in the assay indicated that PS and 3 alpha 5 beta S act via different binding sites from those for glutamate, glycine, and dithiothreitol. Combining the two steroids revealed that they do not share a common binding site. In conclusion, these results substantiate previous evidence of the allosteric modulatory effect induced by PS and 3 alpha 5 beta S on NMDA receptors at nanomolar concentrations. The neurosteroid-mediated modulation of the receptor is also reflected in an altered glutamate stimulated [Ca2+](i), in response to ifenprodil.

Experimental Design: The murine EL4 lymphoma cell line was used for in vitro studies and the EL4 model in which apoptosis was induced with cyclophosphamide and etoposide was used for in vivo studies. In vitro studies compared 3B9 binding in the EL4 cell with that in its counterpart primary cell type of the thymocyte. For in vivo studies, 3B9 was intrinsically or extrinsically labeled with carbon-14 or 1,4,7,10-tetra-azacylododecane-N,N ',N '',N ''''-tetraacetic acid-indium-111, respectively, and biodistribution of the radiotracers was investigated in EL4 tumor-bearing mice, which were treated or not with chemotherapy. Results: La-specific 3B9 mAb bound EL4 cells rather than thymocytes, and binding was detergent resistant. 3B9 binding to dead EL4 cells in vitro was specific, rapid, and saturable. Significantly, more 3B9 bound dead EL4 tumor explant cells after host mice were treated with chemotherapy, which suggested that DNA damage induced 3B9 binding. Tumor binding of 3B9 in vivo was antigen specific and increased significantly after chemotherapy. Tumor accumulation of 3B9 peaked at similar to 50% of the injected dose per gram of tumor 72 h after chemotherapy and correlated with increased tumor cell death. Tumor/organ ratios of 3B9 biodistribution, which included the tumor/blood ratio, exceeded unity 48 or more hours after chemotherapy. Conclusions: La-specific mAb selectively targeted dead tumor cells in vivo, and targeting was augmented by cytotoxic chemotherapy. This novel cell death radioligand may be useful both for radioimmunoscintigraphy and radioimmunotherapy.

J	Matsuura, B; Dong, MQ; Naik, S; Miller, LJ; Onji, M				Matsuura, B; Dong, MQ; Naik, S; Miller, LJ; Onji, M			Differential contributions of motilin receptor extracellular domains for peptide and non-peptidyl agonist binding and activity	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GROWTH-HORMONE SECRETAGOGUE; LIGAND-BINDING; ERYTHROMYCIN; GHRELIN	The family of G protein-coupled receptors that includes receptors for motilin, ghrelin, and growth hormone secretagogue has substantial potential importance as drug targets. Understanding of the molecular basis of hormone binding and receptor activation should provide insights that are helpful in the development of such drugs. We previously examined the unique second extracellular loop domain of the motilin receptor, identifying key epitopes in perimembranous locations at each end of this long loop (Matsuura, B., Dong, M., and Miller, L. J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 9834-9839). Here, we have extended that work, examining the other predicted extracellular domains of the motilin receptor by using sequential deletions of segments ranging from one to six amino acid residues and site-directed alanine replacement mutagenesis approaches. Each construct was transiently expressed in COS cells, and characterized for motilin- and erythromycin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses and motilin radioligand binding. Only those receptor segments that included key Cys residues in positions 25, 30, and 111 or perimembranous regions at the ends of the amino terminus and the first and third extracellular loops disrupted motilin biological activity. Each of these Cys deletions also disrupted action of erythromycin. Alanine replacements for each of the potentially important amino acid residues in the perimembranous segments revealed that residues Gly(36), Pro(103), Leu(109), and Phe(332) were responsible for the selective negative impact on motilin biological activity, while responding normally to erythromycin. These results support the presence of functionally important disulfide bonds in the motilin receptor ectodomain and demonstrate that the structural determinants for binding and biological activity of peptide and non-peptidyl agonist ligands are distinct, with a broad extracellular perimembranous base contributing to normal motilin binding.

The present study utilized a within-subjects design to determine whether chronic treatment with the D2 receptor antagonist raclopride could similarly increase D2 receptor availability. Using the D2-selective radioligand [F-18]fluoroclebopride (FCP), three adult male cynomolgus monkeys were scanned before and after chronic treatment with raclopride (0.01 mg/kg per h for 30 +/- 1day) administered by a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Food-reinforced operant behavior was assessed during treatment. A transitory decrease in responding was observed during the initial eight days of raclopride treatment. Tolerance developed by the tenth session, and responding remained at baseline levels for the duration of treatment and after treatment was discontinued. Averaged across monkeys, chronic raclopride administration increased FCP distribution volume ratios (DVRs) between 12 and 20% in the caudate nucleus, putamen, and anterior cingulate cortex. When monkeys were re-scanned 9-12 months after termination of raclopride treatment, FCP DVRs remained elevated in two subjects, and decreased below baseline levels in the third monkey. Considering the reported 2% test/retest variability for FCP, these findings indicate that chronic treatment with a D2 receptor antagonist can produce large increases in D2 receptor availability as measured with PET. Individual differences in rates of recovery were observed, such that the increases in DVR persisted in two of three subjects.

It has been shown that information on endogenous dopamine (DA) release can be obtained noninvasively by combining positron emission tomography with a dopaminergic challenge. This approach is based on the assumption that an injected radiolabeled ligand competes with the neurotransmitter for the same receptor. Increases in DA release will therefore result in a decreased binding of the radioligand.Objectives: We investigated the effect of the DA reuptake blocker methylphenidate (MP) on the binding of the D-2 receptor ligand [C-11]-raclopride (RAC). Methods: The effect of a 0.25 mg/kg intravenous dose of MP was studied in six healthy volunteers. RAC was administered as a bolus followed by constant infusion, and subjective effects were assessed using verbal rating scales. Results: Control scans without MP administration showed that the mean RAC binding reached stable values approximately 30 min after start of the infusion. MP administration induced a 24% decrease in RAC binding in the total striatum. Correlations were found between the MP-induced change in euphoria and the percent change in binding potential (Delta BP) in the dorsal striatum and between baseline anxiety and Delta BP in the dorsal and middle striatum. We also found a negative correlation between baseline BP in the dorsal striatum and change in euphoria. Conclusions: Our results comply with previous findings, indicating the feasibility of the bolus infusion design combined with a relatively low MP dose to study dopaminergic (dys)function.

Materials and Methods: The effect of SPE was examined on cystometrograms of anesthetized rats induced by intravesical infusion of saline or 0.1% acetic acid. SHR/NDmc-ep (cp/cp) rats received repeat oral administration of SPE and nighttime urodynamic function was determined. The autonomic receptor binding activity of SPE in the rat bladder and prostate was examined by radioligand binding assay. Results: Intraduodenal administration of SPE (60 mg/kg) in anesthetized rat cystometry caused a significant increase in the micturition interval, micturition volume and bladder capacity during intravesical saline infusion. Also, similar administration of SPE at doses of 12 and 20 mg/kg significantly reversed the shortened micturition interval as well as the decreased micturition volume and bladder capacity due to 0.1% acetic acid infusion in a dose dependent manner. In conscious SHR/NDmc-cp (cp/cp) rats repeat oral administration of SPE (6 mg/kg daily) constantly increased the micturition interval and concomitantly decreased voiding frequency. SPE inhibited specific binding of [H-3] NMS ([N-methyl-H-3] scopolamine methyl chloride) (bladder) and [H-3] prazosin (prostate) with IC50 values of 46.1 and 183 mu g/ml, respectively. Conclusions: SPE significantly alleviates urodynamic symptoms in hyperactive rat bladders by increasing bladder capacity and subsequently prolonging the micturition interval. Our data may support the clinical efficacy of SPE for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms.

Compound 29 and the corresponding diallyl analogue 30 (350 nM) exhibited similar binding affinities as the equally substituted neuromuscular-blocking agents toxiferine I (14nM) and alcuronium (234 nM), respectively. The SAR results were confirmed by QSAR studies, which additionally revealed that the presence of hydrogen-bond acceptor groups close to the quaternary nitrogen, is detrimental for the nicotinic binding affinity. The diallyl- and dimethylcaracurinium V salts 13 and 27, respectively, which are known to be among the most potent allosteric modulators of M-2 receptors (EC50 = 10 and 8 nM, respectively), exhibited rather low nicotinic binding affinities for muscle type nAChR (K-i = 1.5 and 5.2 muM, respectively). Such a large difference in affinity suggests that it is possible to develop compounds with high muscarinic allosteric potency and low or negligible affinities for (alpha1)(2)beta1gammadelta nAChR. Additionally, the iso-caracurine V analogues with binding affinities comparable to those of (+)-tubocurarine and alcuronium could become a new class of neuromuscular-blocking agents.

Pregnancy at term caused a significant decrease in the B-max value obtained by saturation binding assays using [H-3]DPCPX as radioligand, suggesting a down-regulation of adenosine A(1) receptor. Moreover, A(1) receptor immunodetection in pregnant rat membranes and the level of mRNA coding A(1) receptor were significantly decreased., This loss of A(1) receptor was associated with a significant increase in receptor affinity, since the K-D value from the [H-3]DPCPX saturation curve and K-i for N-6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) were decreased in pregnant rats. Surprisingly, CHA-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was increased, reflecting enhanced receptor responsiveness. On the other hand, immunoblotting of different alphaGi-protein. isoforms revealed a significant increase in alphaGi(3) level in membranes from pregnant rats. Pre-incubation of membranes with anti-alphaGi(3) antibody blocked the guanosine triphosphate (GTP) or CHA inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase in both pregnant and non-pregnant rats, pointing to alphaGi(3) as the main isoform involved in the A(1) receptor response. These results suggest that, at the end of pregnancy, there is a down-regulation of adenosine A(1) receptors counterbalanced with a strengthened functionality, probably due to an increase in both alphaGi(3) protein and receptor affinity.

Selective DAT expression by dopaminergic neurons has led to use of cocaine analog DAT radioligands to assess rates of progression of dopamine neuronal degeneration in Parkinson's disease. We have documented that DAT is a phosphoprotein that is regulated by phosphorylation through pathways that include protein kinase C cascades. We now extend this work using drugs selective for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase C, MEK1/2, p38 kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II. We compare the drug effects on wild type DAT to the effects on 20 DAT mutants and a DAT deletion. PI3K and MEK1/2 modulators exert strong effects on DAT expression patterns and dopamine uptake V-max. PKC principally modulates V-max. Neither p38 nor Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II agents exert significant influences on wild type DAT. Several mutants and a DAT with an N-terminal deletion display alterations that interact with the effects of kinase modulators, especially S7A for PKC effects; T62A, S581A, and T612A for PI3K effects; and S12A and T595A mutants for MEK1/2 effects. P-32-Labeling studies confirm several of these effects of kinase pathway modulators on DAT phosphorylation. DAT expression and activities can be regulated by kinase cascades that require phosphoacceptor sites most concentrated in its N terminus. These results have a number of implications for DAT regulation and mandate caution in using DAT radioligand binding to infer changes in dopaminergic neuronal integrity after treatments that alter activities of these kinase pathways.

In peripheral sodium-transporting tissues, the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) isoform-1 is an early corticosteroid target gene in the activation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs). Sodium transport across the human ocular nonpigmented and pigmented ciliary epithelial bilayer (NPE-PE) is essential for aqueous humor production, but the expression of SGK1 and ENaC subunits remain to be defined. METHODS. SGK1 and ENaC subunits were evaluated by in situ hybridization and RT-PCR analysis on human NPE-PE sections and an NPE cell line (ODM-2). Northern blot analyses were conducted on ODM-2 cells incubated with dexamethasone (DEX) or aldosterone (ALDO) and RU38486 (a glucocorticoid receptor [GR] antagonist) or RU26752 (a mineralocorticoid receptor [MR] antagonist) or both inhibitors. The affinity of the GRs and MRS for DEX and ALDO was assessed by radioligand-binding assays. RESULTS. Expression of SGK1 and ENaC subunits was confirmed in NPE-PE tissues and ODM-2 cells. Dose-dependent induction of SGK1 mRNA in the ODM-2 cells was demonstrated after incubation with DEX or ALDO. While response to DEX was not inhibited by RU38486 or RU26752, there was a moderate reduction in induction by ALDO in the presence of RU26752 that was completely abolished in the presence of both inhibitors. Specific binding of (3)[H]DEX and (3)[H]ALDO was established, revealing greater expression of GRs than MRS. CONCLUSIONS. The expression of ENaCs within the NPE-PE and corticosteroid regulation of SGK1 through the GR and MR, indicate that this mechanism may be a feature of sodium transport in the human ocular ciliary epithelium.

Binding experiments revealed that F-180 exhibited a high affinity for the human Via receptor subtype (K-i = 11 nM) and was selective for this receptor subtype. 2 Functional studies performed on CHO cells expressing human Via receptors indicate that similarly to AVP, F-180 can stimulate the accumulation of inositol phosphate. The activation constant (K-act) for both F-180 and AVP was 1.7 nm. F-180 was also an agonist for the human V-2 and V-1b receptor subtypes and an antagonist for the human OT receptor. 3 Since marked species pharmacological differences for vasopressin receptors have been described, we studied the properties of F-180 on various mammalian species. F-180 showed high affinity and good selectivity for human and bovine Via receptors, but weak affinity and non selective properties for rat Via receptors. 4 To assess the functional properties of F-180 on a native biological model, we performed studies on primary cultures of cells from bovine zona fasciculata (ZF). As AVP, F-180 stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation and cortisol secretion with similar efficiency. 5 In conclusion, we demonstrate that F-180 is the first selective Via agonist described for human and bovine vasopressin receptors. Therefore F-180 can be used as a powerful pharmacological tool to characterize the actions of vasopressin that are mediated by Via receptor subtypes. British Journal of Pharmacology.

It has recently been reported that the cloned melatonin receptors (MT1, MT2 and Mel1c) exhibit differential abilities to stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) via G(16). Here we examined the molecular basis of such differences in melatonin receptor signaling, Coexpression of MT1 or MT2 with the a subunit of G(16) (Galpha(16)) allowed COS-7 cells to accumulate inositol phosphates in response to 2-iodomelatonin. In contrast, Mel1c did not activate Galpha(16) even though its expression was demonstrated by radioligand binding and agonist-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. As Mel1c possesses an exceptionally large C-terminal tail, we further asked if this structural feature prevented productive coupling to Galpha(16). Eleven chimeric melatonin or mutant receptors were constructed by swapping all or part of the C-terminal tail between MT1, MT2 and Mel1c. All chimeras were fully capable of binding 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin and inhibiting adenylyl cyclase. Chimeras containing the full-length Mel1c tail were incapable of activating Galpha(16), while those that contained the complete C-terminal region of either MT1 or MT2 stimulated PLC. Incorporation of the extra portion of the C-terminal tail of Mel1c to either MT1 or MT2 completely abolished the chimeras' ability to stimulate PLC via Galpha(16). In contrast, truncation of the C-terminal tail of Mel1c allowed interaction with Galpha(16). Our results suggest that Galpha(16) can discern structural differences amid the three melatonin receptors and provide evidence for functional distinction of Mel1c from MT1 and MT2 receptors.

The purpose of the current study was to investigate whether this reflected an alteration in kinetics of adenosine In cerebrospinal fluid or in the number of spinal A, adenosine receptors after nerve injury. Methods: Male rats were anesthetized, and the left L5 and L6 spinal nerves were ligated. Two weeks later, a lumbar intrathecal catheter and intrathecal space microdialysis catheter were Inserted. Adenosine, 20 mug, was injected intrathecally in these anti In normal rats, and microdialysates of the intrathecal space were obtained. Radioligand binding studies of adenosine A(1) receptors were determined In spinal cord tissue from other normal and spinal nerve-ligated rats. Results: Adenosine disappeared from rat cerebrospinal fluid within 30 min after intrathecal injection, with no difference between normal and spinal nerve-ligated animals. A(1) adenosine receptor binding sites in (lie spinal cord were increased after spinal nerve ligation. This increase disappeared when adenosine deaminase was added to the membrane homogenates, suggestive of decreased endogenous adenosine in the membranes of nerve-ligated animals. Conclusion: These data show that prolonged alleviation of hypersensitivity observed with intrathecal adenosine in this animal model of neuropathic pain Is not due to prolonged residence in cerebrospinal fluid, although pharmacokinetics in tissues are unknown. Similarly, there is no evidence for up-regulation in spinal A(1) adenosine receptors after spinal nerve ligation, and the adenosine deaminase experiment is consistent with a depiction of adenosine in spinal cord tissue after spinal nerve ligation.

Saturation binding and displacement experiments showed that [I-125]YVP and [I-125]EYF bound selectively with a very high affinity, K-D = 0.18 nM and 0.06 nM, to NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptors respectively. By using in vitro autoradiography with these radioligands and frog pancreatic polypeptide (PP) as selective unlabelled competitor of NPFF2 binding sites. NPFF1 and NPFF2 receptor distribution was analyzed throughout the rat CNS. The highest densities of [I-125]EYF binding sites were seen in the most external layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the parafascicular thalamic nucleus. laterodorsal thalamic nucleus and presubiculum of hippocampus. All specific binding of this radioligand was inhibited by 200 nM frog PP. The density of 0.1 nM [I-125]YVP binding was much smaller in all brain areas and frog PP-insensitive binding sites (NPFF, receptor subtype) were detected in septal, thalamic and hypothalamic areas but,ere absent in the spinal cord. The restricted distribution of NPFF1 receptors in the CNS supports its specific role in a limited number of neuronal functions. In contrast to the rat spinal cord adhere the NPFF1 system is absent, there is no strict separation between NPFF1 and NPFF2 system at the supraspinal level. (C) 2002 IBRO.

Neuropathological studies have identified numerous degenerative changes in the cerebellum of ET patients, however. These data align with considerable clinical and neurophysiological data linking ET to the cerebellum. While neuroimaging studies have variably shown mild atrophy in the cerebellum, marked atrophy is not a clear feature of the cerebellum in ET and a search for a more suitable neuroimaging signature of neurodegeneration is in order. Postmortem studies in ET have examined different neuropathological alterations in the cerebellum, but as of yet have not focused on measures of generalized synaptic markers. This pilot study focuses on synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), a protein expressed in practically all synapses in the brain, as a measure of synaptic density in postmortem ET cases.MethodsThe current study utilized autoradiography with the SV2A radioligand [18F]SDM-16 to assess synaptic density in the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus in three ET cases and three age-matched controls.ResultsUsing [18F]SDM-16, SV2A was 53% and 46% lower in the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus, respectively, in ET cases compared to age-matched controls.ConclusionIn this pilot study, using in vitro SV2A autoradiography, we have observed significantly lower synaptic density in the cerebellar cortex and dentate nucleus of ET cases. Future research could expand on our sample size and focus on in vivo imaging in ET to explore whether SV2A imaging could serve as a much-needed disease biomarker.

The present study investigated the effects of the herbal product, saw palmetto extract (SPE) on TRPV1-mediated Ca2+ influx and specific [H-3]resiniferatoxin ([H-3]RTX) binding to TRPV1 in HEK293 cells expressing TRPV1 (HEK293VR11 cells). Methods Ca2+ influx induced by and the direct binding activity of TRPV1 were measured using a method with Fura 2-AM, a cytoplasmic calcium indicator, and a radioligand binding assay using a [H-3]RTX, respectively. Results SPE did not markedly affect Ca2+ influx in HEK293VR11 cells; however, it significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced increases in Ca2+ influx in these cells. The specific binding of [H-3]RTX in HEK293VR11 cells was saturable with K-d value of 120 +/- 7 pM and B-max of 1.07 +/- 0.10 fmol/mg protein, and was inhibited by low concentrations of non-labeled RTX with K-i of 60.1 +/- 7.6 nM. These results confirmed the pharmacological specificity of specific binding sites of [H-3]RTX to TRPV1 in HEK293VR11 cells. SPE inhibited the specific binding of [H-3]RTX in a concentration-dependent manner, with K-i of 24.2 +/- 1.4 mu g/mL. Conclusions The present study demonstrated for the first time, that SPE inhibited capsaicin-induced Ca2+ influx with binding to TRPV1 in HEL293VR11 cells. These results will contribute to a more detailed understanding of the pharmacological effects of SPE on urinary dysfunction.

Acute acetate administration increases endogenous opioid levels in the human brain: A [<SUP>11</SUP>C]carfentanil molecular imaging study	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Acetate; PET; opioid	RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; DOPAMINE; PET; PROOPIOMELANOCORTIN; RESPONSES; APPETITE; RELEASE; BINDING; OBESITY; MODEL	Introduction: A recent study has shown that acetate administration leads to a fourfold increase in the transcription of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) mRNA in the hypothalamus. POMC is cleaved to peptides, including beta-endorphin, an endogenous opioid (EO) agonist that binds preferentially to the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). We hypothesised that an acetate challenge would increase the levels of EO in the human brain. We have previously demonstrated that increased EO release in the human brain can be detected using positron emission tomography (PET) with the selective MOR radioligand [C-11]carfentanil. We used this approach to evaluate the effects of an acute acetate challenge on EO levels in the brain of healthy human volunteers. Methods: Seven volunteers each completed a baseline [C-11]carfentanil PET scan followed by an administration of sodium acetate before a second [C-11]carfentanil PET scan. Dynamic PET data were acquired over 90 minutes, and corrected for attenuation, scatter and subject motion. Regional [C-11] carfentanil BPND values were then calculated using the simplified reference tissue model (with the occipital grey matter as the reference region). Change in regional EO concentration was evaluated as the change in [C-11]carfentanil BPND following acetate administration. Results: Following sodium acetate administration, 2.5-6.5% reductions in [C-11]carfentanil regional BPND were seen, with statistical significance reached in the cerebellum, temporal lobe, orbitofrontal cortex, striatum and thalamus. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that an acute acetate challenge has the potential to increase EO release in the human brain, providing a plausible mechanism of the central effects of acetate on appetite in humans.

Noninvasive molecular imaging via positron emission tomography (PET) would allow the in vivo quantification of this receptor in pathological processes and most likely enable the identification and clinical monitoring of respective cancer therapies. On the basis of a bicyclic pyridopyrimidine-2,4-dione core structure, the new adenosine A(2B) receptor ligand 9 was synthesized, containing a 2-fluoropyridine moiety suitable for labeling with the short-lived PET radionuclide fluorine-18. Compound 9 showed a high binding affinity for the human A(2B) receptor (K-i(A(2B)) = 2.51 nM), along with high selectivities versus the A(1), A(2A), and A(3) receptor subtypes. Therefore, it was radiofluorinated via nucleophilic aromatic substitution of the corresponding nitro precursor using [F-18]F-/K-2.2.2./K2CO3 in DMSO at 120 degrees C. Metabolic studies of [F-18]9 in mice revealed about 60% of radiotracer intact in plasma at 30 minutes p.i. A preliminary PET study in healthy mice showed an overall biodistribution of [F-18]9, corresponding to the known ubiquitous but low expression of the A(2B) receptor. Consequently, [F-18]9 represents a novel PET radiotracer with high affinity and selectivity toward the adenosine A(2B) receptor and a suitable in vivo profile. Subsequent studies are envisaged to investigate the applicability of [F-18]9 to detect alterations in the receptor density in certain cancer-related disease models.

Electroconvulsive stimulation differentially affects [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MDL100,907 binding to cortical and subcortical 5HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors in porcine brain	JOURNAL OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						[C-11]MDL100907; 5HT(2A) receptors; electroconvulsive stimulation; minipig; positron emission tomography; serotonin	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT2 RECEPTORS; DESIPRAMINE TREATMENT; SEROTONIN-2 RECEPTOR; MAJOR DEPRESSION; MESSENGER-RNA; DOPAMINE D-1; RAT-BRAIN; SHOCK; THERAPY	Background: Electroconvulsive therapy is an effective therapy of depression. We hypothesized that the beneficial effects are mediated partly by decreased serotonin receptor availability in the cortex. Aims: We used positron emission tomography with the serotonin 5HT(2A) receptor radioligand [C-11]MDL100,907 to determine serotonin receptor availability in response to electroconvulsive stimulation (ECS). Methods: Seven Gottingen minipigs were deeply anaesthetized and imaged at baseline before the onset of ECS, and at 1-2 and 8-10 days after the end of a clinical course of ECS, consisting of 10 sessions over 3.5 weeks, and post-ECS values were compared to baseline. One additional minipig was anaesthetized over 10 sessions without ECS, as a control. We analysed images with the Ichise model for binding in cortex and hippocampus, followed by whole-brain analysis by statistical non-parametric mapping. Results: We found significantly increased binding potential of [C-11]MDL100,907 in the cortex and hippocampus 1-2 days after ECS, consistent with increased serotonin receptor availability compared to baseline. By 8-10 days after the final ECS, the average tracer binding had returned towards baseline. However, we also found significantly decreased tracer binding in the subcortical regions of olfactory bulb, pons, thalamus and striatum. Conclusions: With ECS, minipigs, unlike primates but like rodents, have higher availability at cortical and hippocampal 5HT(2A) receptors. Decreased tracer binding is consistent with reduced serotonin receptor availability as a differential effect of ECS on 5HT(2A) receptors in subcortical regions of minipig brain.

The affinity, intrinsic activity and selectivity of a structurally novel EP<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist at human prostanoid receptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; INTRAOCULAR-PRESSURE; TAPRENEPAG ISOPROPYL; INTERNATIONAL UNION; IDENTIFICATION; GLAUCOMA; CLASSIFICATION; ETHANOLAMIDES; PROSTAMIDES	Background and Purpose Prostanoid EP2 receptor agonists exhibit several activities including ocular hypotension, tocolysis and anti-inflammatory activity. This report describes the affinity and selectivity of a structurally novel, non-prostanoid EP2 receptor agonist, PGN-9856, and its therapeutic potential. Experimental Approach The pharmacology of a series of non-prostanoid EP2 receptor agonists was determined according to functional and radioligand binding studies, mostly using human recombinant prostanoid receptor transfectants. The selectivity of PGN-9856, as the preferred compound, was subsequently determined by using a diverse variety of non-prostanoid target proteins. The therapeutic potential of PGN-9856 was addressed by determining its activity in relevant primate cell, tissue and disease models. Key Results PGN-9856 was a selective and high affinity (pKi >= 8.3) ligand at human recombinant EP2 receptors. In addition to high affinity binding, it was a potent and full EP2 receptor agonist with a high level of selectivity at EP1, EP3, EP4, DP, FP, IP and TP receptors. In cells overexpressing human recombinant EP2 receptors, PGN-9856 displayed a potency (pEC(50)>= 8.5) and a maximal response (increase in cAMP) comparable to that of the endogenous agonist PGE(2). PGN-9856 exhibited no appreciable affinity (up 10 mu M) for a range of 53 other receptors, ion channels and enzymes. Finally, PGN-9856 exhibited tocolytic, anti-inflammatory and long-acting ocular hypotensive properties consistent with its potent EP2 receptor agonist properties. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS PGN- 9856 is a potent, selective and efficacious prostanoid EP2 receptor agonist with diverse potential therapeutic applications: tocolytic, anti- inflammatory and notably anti-glaucoma.

We report on a case of seizures, systemic inflammatory response, and rhabdomyolysis associated with laboratory-confirmed 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine and 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl) phenethylamine exposure. A 17-year-old male teenager developed seizures after taking 2 strips of acid. The seizures resolved with midazolam, but he became apneic and was intubated. His head computed tomography was unremarkable. Initial creatinine level was 1.5 mg/dL, with a creatine kinase of 112 U/L. His urine immunoassay drug screen was negative. He was extubated within 12 hours but had elevated temperatures for 48 hours. He was treated with antibiotics, but no source of infection was identified. His creatinine level peaked at 2.46 mg/dL. His creatine kinase peaked 72 hours later at 14579 U/L. He was treated with intravenous fluids and did not require renal replacement therapy. He recovered fully and was discharged after 5 days. Serum and urine samples were tested using liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We detected 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine and 4-iodo-2,5-dimethoxy-N-(2-methoxybenzyl) phenethylamine in both serum and urine. No other substances were detected. The 2C drugs and their n-benzyloxymethyl analogs are potent serotonergic agents. Their use has been associated with multiple adverse effects including seizures, rhabdomyolysis, and death. They should be considered in differential diagnosis for drug-induced seizures and as a cause for systemic inflammatory response. This case highlights the significant toxicity seen with these compounds.

A<sub>2B</sub> adenosine receptor antagonists: Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel xanthine derivatives	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Adenosine receptors; Xanthine; 2-Oxopyrrolidine; Mouse liver microsomes; Pharmacokinetics	HIGH-AFFINITY; SELECTIVE ANTAGONISTS; CELLS; ASTHMA; RADIOLIGAND; INCREASE; POTENCY; AGONIST; SYSTEM	A(2BA)doR is a low affinity adenosine receptor that functions by Gs mediated elevation of cAMP and subsequent downstream signaling. The receptor has been implicated in lung inflammatory disorders like COPD and asthma. Several potent and selective A(2B)AdoR antagonists have been reported in literature, however most of the compounds suffer from poor pharmacokinetic profile. Therefore, with the aim to identify novel, potent and selective A(2B)AdoR antagonists with improved pharmacokinetic properties, we first explored more constrained form of MRS-1754 (4). To improve the metabolic stability, several linker modifications were attempted as replacement of amide linker along with different phenyl or other heteroaryls between C8 position of xanthine head group and terminal phenyl ring. SAR optimization resulted in identification of two novel A(2B)AdoR antagonists, 8-{1-[5-Oxo-1-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-pyrrolidin-3-ylmethyl]-1H-pyrazol-4-yl}-1,3-diPropyl-xanthine (31) and 8-(1-{2-Oxo-2-[4-(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-piperazin-l-yl]-ethyl}-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dipropyl-xanthine (65), with high binding affinity (K-i = 1 and 1.5 nM, respectively) and selectivity for A(2B)AdoR with very good functional potency of 0.9 nM and 4 nM, respectively. Compound 31 and 65 also displayed good pharmacokinetic properties in mice with 27% and 65% oral bioavailability respectively. When evaluated in in vivo mice model of asthma, compound 65 also inhibited airway inflammation and airway reactivity in ovalbumin induced allergic asthma at 3 mpk dose. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Smooth Muscle Endothelin B Receptors Regulate Blood Pressure but Not Vascular Function or Neointimal Remodeling	HYPERTENSION			English	Article						autoradiography; endothelin-1; hypertension; neointima; vasoconstriction	RADIOLIGAND BINDING; ET(B) RECEPTORS; NITRIC-OXIDE; EXPRESSION; KNOCKOUT; DELETION; SYSTEM; PROLIFERATION; HYPERTENSION; ANTAGONIST	The role of smooth muscle endothelin(B) (ETB) receptors in regulating vascular function, blood pressure (BP), and neointimal remodeling has not been established. Selective knockout mice were generated to address the hypothesis that loss of smooth muscle ETB receptors would reduce BP, alter vascular contractility, and inhibit neointimal remodeling. ETB receptors were selectively deleted from smooth muscle by crossing floxed ETB mice with those expressing cre-recombinase controlled by the transgelin promoter. Functional consequences of ETB deletion were assessed using myography. BP was measured by telemetry, and neointimal lesion formation induced by femoral artery injury. Lesion size and composition (day 28) were analyzed using optical projection tomography, histology, and immunohistochemistry. Selective deletion of ETB was confirmed by genotyping, autoradiography, polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. ETB mediated contraction was reduced in trachea, but abolished from mesenteric veins, of knockout mice. Induction of ETB mediated contraction in mesenteric arteries was also abolished in these mice. Femoral artery function was unaltered, and baseline BP modestly elevated in smooth muscle ETB knockout compared with controls (+4.2 +/- 0.2 mm Hg; P<0.0001), but salt-induced and ETB blockade-mediated hypertension were unaltered. Circulating endothelin-1 was not altered in knockout mice. ETB-mediated contraction was not induced in femoral arteries by incubation in culture medium or lesion formation, and lesion size was not altered in smooth muscle ETB knockout mice. In the absence of other pathology, ETB receptors in vascular smooth muscle make a small but significant contribution to ETB-dependent regulation of BP. These ETB receptors have no effect on vascular contraction or neointimal remodeling.

The synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) isoform has been identified as the binding site of the antiepileptic levetiracetam (LEV), making it an interesting therapeutic target for epilepsy. F-18-UCB-H is a novel PET imaging agent with a nanomolar affinity for human SV2A. Methods: Preclinical PET studies were performed with isoflurane-anesthetized rats. The arterial input function was measured with an arteriovenous shunt and a beta-microprobe system. F-18-UCB-H was injected intravenously (bolus of 140 +/- 20 MBq). Results: Brain uptake of F-18-UCB-H was high, matching the expected homogeneous distribution of SV2A. The distribution volume (V-t) for F-18-UCB-H was calculated with Logan graphic analysis, and the effect of LEV pretreatment on V-t was measured. In control animals the whole-brain V-t was 9.76 +/- 0.52 mL/cm(3) (mean +/- SD; n = 4; test- retest), and the reproducibility in test-retest studies was 10.4% +/- 6.5% (mean +/- SD). The uptake of 18F-UCB-H was dose dependently blocked by pretreatment with LEV (0.1-100 mg/kg intravenously). Conclusion: Our results indicated that F-18-UCB-H is a suitable radiotracer for the imaging of SV2A in vivo. To our knowledge, this is the first PET tracer for the in vivo quantification of SV2A. The necessary steps for the implementation of F-18-UCB-H production under good manufacturing practice conditions and the first human studies are being planned.

[DOTA]Somatostatin-14 analogs and their <SUP>111</SUP>In-radioligands: Effects of decreasing ring-size on sst<sub>1-5</sub> profile, stability and tumor targeting	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						DOTA-conjugated somatostatin; In-111-radiopeptide; Pansomatostatin radioligand; Radiotracer stability; Tumor targeting	SOMATOSTATIN RECEPTOR SUBTYPE-2; IN-VIVO; HIGH-AFFINITY; INTERNALIZATION; VITRO; EXPRESSION; THERAPY; AGONIST; POTENT; RADIOTRACERS	Multiple somatostatin receptor (sst)-subtype expression has been manifested in several human tumors. Hence, the availability of radiopeptides retaining the full pansomatostatin profile of the native hormone (SS14) is expected to increase the sensitivity and broaden the clinical indications of currently applied sst2-preferring cyclic octapeptide radioligands, like OctreoScan (R) ([In-111-DTPA]octreotide). On the other hand, SS14 has been excluded from clinical use due to its rapid in vivo degradation. We herein present a small library of seven novel cyclic SS14-mimics carrying at their N-terminus the universal chelator DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) for stable binding of medically useful radiometals, like In-111. By decreasing the number of amino acids composing the ring in their structure from 12 up to 6 AA, we induced important changes in key-biological parameters in vitro and in vivo. In particular, we observed unexpected changes and even total loss of sst(1-5)-affinity (6AA-ring), as well as weaker sst(2)-internalization efficacy as the ring size decreased. In contrast, in vivo stability increased with decreasing ring size, reaching its maximum in the 6AA-ring analogs. Interestingly, only the 12AA- and 9AA-ring members of this series showed sst(2)-specific uptake in AR4-2J tumors in mice revealing the prominent role of ring size on the biological response of tested SS14-derived radioligands.

However, in vitro assays suggest that MPPF is not a substrate of human P-gp. We have now tested the influence of inhibiting P-gp on the brain kinetics of F-18-MPPF in mice and non-human primates. We measured the peripheral kinetics (arterial input function, metabolism, free fraction in plasma (f(P))) during F-18-MPPF brain PET scanning in baboons with or without cyclosporine A (CsA) infusion. We measured H-3-MPPF transport at the mouse BBB using in situ brain perfusion in P-gp/Bcrp deficient mice and after inhibiting P-gp with PSC833. There was an unexpected 1.9-fold increase in brain area under the curve in CsA-treated baboons (n = 4), with no change in radiometabolite-corrected arterial input. However, total volume of distribution corrected for f(P) (V-T/f(P)) remained unchanged. In situ brain perfusion showed that P-gp restricted the permeability of the mouse BBB to H-3-MPPF while Bcrp did not. These and previous in vitro results suggest that P-gp may not influence the permeability of human BBB to F-18-MPPF. However, CsA treatment increased F-18-MPPF free fraction, which is responsible for a misleading, P-gp unrelated enhanced brain uptake.

N-6-(4-hydroxybenzyl) adenine riboside (NHBA) was originally isolated from G. elata. For the first time we report a detailed study on the effects and mechanisms of NHBA on its sedative and hypnotic activity. Adenosine, an endogenous sleep factor, regulates sleep-wake cycle via interacting with adenosine A(1)/A(2A) receptors. Using radioligand binding studies and cAMP accumulation assays, our results show that NHBA may be a functional ligand for the adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors. NHBA significantly decreases spontaneous locomotor activity and potentiates the hypnotic effect of sodium pentobarbital in mice. Sleep architecture analyses reveal that NHBA significantly decreases wakefulness time and increases NREM sleep times. However, NHBA does not affect the amount of REM sleep. Pretreatment with the adenosine A(1) receptor antagonist DPCPX or the A(2)A receptor antagonist SCH 58261 significantly reverses the increase in sleeping time induced by NHBA in sodium pentobarbital treated mice. Immunohistochemical studies show that NHBA increases c-Fos expression in GABAergic neurons of the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), which suggests that NHBA activates the sleep center in the anterior hypothalamus. Altogether, these results indicate that NHBA produces significant sedative and hypnotic effects. Such effects might be mediated by the activation of adenosine A(1)/A(2A) receptors and stimulation of the sleep center VLPO. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Allosteric communication between the protomers of the dimer can alter ligand binding, receptor conformation and interactions with different effector proteins. In this study we investigated the allosteric interactions between wild type and mutant protomers of type 1 angiotensin receptor (AT(1)R) dimers transiently expressed in CHO cells. In our experimental setup, one protomer of the dimer was selectively stimulated and the beta-arrestin2 binding and conformation alteration of the other protomer was followed. The interaction between beta-arrestin2 and the non-stimulated protomer was monitored through a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) based method. To measure the conformational alterations in the non-stimulated protomer directly, we also used a BRET based intramolecular receptor biosensor, which was created by inserting yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) into the 3rd intracellular loop of AT(1)R and fusing Renilla luciferase (RLuc) to its C terminal region. We have detected beta-arrestin2 binding, and altered conformation of the non-stimulated protomer. The cooperative ligand binding of the receptor homodimer was also observed by radioligand dissociation experiments. Mutation of the conserved DRY sequence in the activated protomer, which is also required for G protein activation, abolished all the observed allosteric effects. These data suggest that allosteric interactions in the homodimers of AT(1)R significantly affect the function of the non-stimulated protomer, and the conserved DRY motif has a crucial role in these interactions.

J	Jahnsen, JA; Uhlén, S				Jahnsen, Jan Anker; Uhlen, Staffan			The N-terminal region of the human 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor has as a cleavable signal peptide	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						5-HT2C; Signal peptide; Receptor construct; Cys23Ser; C23S; N-tail; rs6318	ENDOTHELIN-B RECEPTOR; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE(2C) RECEPTOR; PROTEIN; GENE; EXPRESSION; MEMBRANE; IDENTIFICATION; PHARMACOLOGY; INCREASES; SEQUENCE	The 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C (5-HT2C) receptor has a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site at amino acid position 23 in its N-terminal tail. The polymorphism involves conversion of a cysteine to serine. The site, designated C23S, is located within a 32 amino acid long predicted signal peptide. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the 5-HT2C receptor indeed has a functional cleavable signal peptide. For this purpose, ten N-terminally modified 5-HT2C receptors were constructed. Modifications included addition of the influenza virus hemagglutinin signal peptide, addition of a FLAG epitope, truncation of the N-terminal tail, and combinations of these changes. The receptors were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The relative amounts of receptors expressed at the membranes were quantified by [H-3]-mesulergine radioligand binding. In one of the receptor constructs the FLAG epitope was inserted just after the endogenous putative signal peptide. Immunostaining with the M1 antibody, which recognizes the FLAG epitope only as free N-terminal entity, was used to detect whether the putative signal peptide preceding the FLAG epitope was cleaved off. The results suggest the following conclusions. The predicted signal peptide in the N-terminal tail of the 5-HT2C receptor acts as a cleavable signal peptide. Cleaving of the signal peptide is important for translocation of the wild type receptor to the plasma membrane. The two amino acids differentially encoded by the C23S SNP are likely absent from the mature 5-HT2C receptor. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study characterized the molecular mode of action of this modulator in both recombinant and native systems. Radioligand-binding studies revealed that LY2033298 displayed a preference for the active state of the M-4 mAChR, manifested as a potentiation in the binding affinity of ACh (but not antagonists) and an increase in the proportion of high-affinity agonist-receptor complexes. This property accounted for the robust allosteric agonism displayed by the modulator in recombinant cells in assays of [S-35]GTP gamma S binding, extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta phosphorylation, and receptor internalization. We also found that the extent of modulation by LY2033298 differed depending on the signaling pathway, indicating that LY2033298 engenders functional selectivity in the actions of ACh. This property was retained in NG108-15 cells, which natively express rodent M-4 mAChRs. Functional interaction studies between LY2033298 and various orthosteric and allosteric ligands revealed that its site of action overlaps with the allosteric site used by prototypical mAChR modulators. Importantly, LY2033298 reduced [H-3]ACh release from rat striatal slices, indicating retention of its ability to allosterically potentiate endogenous ACh in situ. Moreover, its ability to potentiate oxotremorine-mediated inhibition of condition avoidance responding in rodents was significantly attenuated in M-4 mAChR knockout mice, validating the M-4 mAChR as a key target of action of this novel allosteric ligand.

However, a major limitation to testing this hypothesis has been a lack of highly selective ligands for individual mAChR subtypes. We now report the rigorous molecular characterization of a novel compound, benzylquinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), which acts as a potent, highly selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the rat M-1 receptor. This compound does not directly activate the receptor, but acts at an allosteric site to increase functional responses to orthosteric agonists. Radioligand binding studies revealed that BQCA increases M-1 receptor affinity for acetylcholine. We found that activation of the M-1 receptor by BQCA induces a robust inward current and increases spontaneous EPSCs in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) pyramidal cells, effects which are absent in acute slices from M-1 receptor knock-out mice. Furthermore, to determine the effect of BQCA on intact and functioning brain circuits, multiple single-unit recordings were obtained from the mPFC of rats that showed BQCA increases firing of mPFC pyramidal cells in vivo. BQCA also restored discrimination reversal learning in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease and was found to regulate non-amyloidogenic APP processing in vitro, suggesting that M-1 receptor PAMs have the potential to provide both symptomatic and disease modifying effects in Alzheimer's disease patients. Together, these studies provide compelling evidence that M-1 receptor activation induces a dramatic excitation of PFC neurons and suggest that selectively activating the M-1 mAChR subtype may ameliorate impairments in cognitive function.

Differential effects of quercetin, apigenin and genistein on signalling pathways of protease-activated receptors PAR<sub>1</sub> and PAR<sub>4</sub> in platelets	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						flavonoids; thrombin; protease-activated receptors; platelets	TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR; THROMBOXANE A(2); P2Y(12) RECEPTOR; FLAVONOIDS INHIBIT; CA2+ MOBILIZATION; GAMMA-THROMBIN; HEART-DISEASE; CALDAG-GEFI; AGGREGATION; SECRETION	Background and purpose: The modulation by flavonoids of platelet responses induced by thrombin has been little investigated, and the antiplatelet activity, as well as possible inhibitory mechanisms of these compounds on thrombin signalling, has not yet been elucidated. We explored whether flavonoids affect platelet signalling pathways triggered by thrombin and by the selective activation of its protease-activated receptors (PARs) 1 and 4, and analysed the antagonism of these polyphenols at thrombin receptors. Experimental approach: We investigated the effect of a range of polyphenolic compounds on platelet aggregation, 5-HT secretion, intracellular calcium mobilization, protein kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation, triggered by thrombin and PAR agonist peptides (PAR-APs). The ability of these flavonoids to bind to thrombin receptors was investigated by competitive radioligand binding assays using 125I-thrombin. Key results: Quercetin, apigenin and genistein impaired platelet aggregation, as well as 5-HT release and calcium mobilization, induced by thrombin and PAR-APs. Quercetin and apigenin were inhibitors of protein kinases, but genistein exhibited a minimal ability to suppress platelet phosphorylation. Binding assays did not establish any kind of interaction between thrombin receptors and any of the flavonoids tested. Conclusions and implications: Quercetin, apigenin and genistein did not inhibit thrombin responses by interacting with thrombin receptors, but by interfering with intracellular signalling. While inhibition by genistein may be a consequence of affecting calcium mobilization, subsequent platelet secretion and aggregation, for quercetin and apigenin, inhibition of kinase activation may also be involved in the impairment of platelet responses.

Quantitation of cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptors in healthy human brain using positron emission tomography and an inverse agonist radioligand	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; Brain imaging; Neuroimaging	IN-VIVO; MOUSE-BRAIN; BINDING; EXPRESSION; MODEL	[C-11]MePPEP is a high affinity, CB1 receptor-selective, inverse agonist that has been studied in rodents and monkeys. We examined the ability of [C-11]MePPEP to quantify CB1 receptors in human brain as distribution volume calculated with the "gold standard" method of compartmental modeling and compared results with the simple measure of brain uptake. A total of 17 healthy subjects participated in 26 positron emission tomography (PET) scans, with 8 having two PET scans to assess retest variability. After injection of [C-11]MePPEP, brain uptake of radioactivity was high (e.g., 3.6 SUV in putamen at similar to 60 min) and washed out very slowly. A two-tissue compartment model yielded values of distribution volume (which is proportional to receptor density) that were both well identified (SE 5%) and stable between 60 and 210 min. The simple measure of brain uptake (average concentration of radioactivity between 40 and 80 min) had good retest variability (similar to 8%) and moderate intersubject variability (16%, coefficient of variation). In contrast, distribution volume had two-fold greater retest variability (similar to 15%) and, thus, less precision. In addition, distribution volume had three-fold greater intersubject variability (similar to 52%). The decreased precision of distribution volume compared to brain uptake was likely due to the slow washout of radioactivity from brain and to noise in measurements of the low concentrations of [C-11]MePPEP in plasma. These results suggest that brain uptake can be used for within subject studies (e. g., to measure receptor occupancy by medications) but that distribution volume remains the gold standard for accurate measurements between groups.

An Ivermectin-Sensitive Glutamate-Gated Chloride Channel from the Parasitic Nematode <i>Haemonchus contortus</i>	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							CAENORHABDITIS-ELEGANS; PHARYNGEAL MUSCLE; BETA-SUBUNITS; ASCARIS-SUUM; ION-CHANNEL; AVERMECTIN; PROTEIN; RESISTANCE; RECEPTOR; BINDING	Nematode glutamate-gated chloride channels are targets of the macrocyclic lactones, the most important group of anthelmintics available. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, channels formed by the GluCl alpha 3B subunit from the parasite Haemonchus contortus were more sensitive to L-glutamate (EC50 = 27.6 +/- 2.7 mu M) than those formed by the homologous subunit from Caenorhabditis elegans (EC50 = 2.2 +/- 0.12 mM). Ibotenate was a partial agonist (EC50 = 87.7 +/- 3.5 mu M). The H. contortus channels responded to low concentrations of ivermectin (estimated EC50 = similar to 0.1 +/- 1.0 nM), opening slowly and irreversibly in a highly cooperative manner: the rate of channel opening was concentration-dependent. Responses to glutamate and ivermectin were inhibited by picrotoxinin and fipronil. Mutating an N-terminal domain amino acid, leucine 256, to phenylalanine increased the EC50 for L-glutamate to 92.2 +/- 3.5 mu M, and reduced the Hill number from 1.89 +/- 0.35 to 1.09 +/- 0.16. It increased the K-d for radiolabeled ivermectin binding from 0.35 +/- 0.1 to 2.26 +/- 0.78 nM. Two other mutations (E114G and V235A) had no effect on L-glutamate activation or ivermectin binding: one (T300S) produced no detectable channel activity, but ivermectin binding was similar to wild-type. The substitution of any aromatic amino acid for Leu256 had similar effects in the radioligand binding assay. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the GluCl subunits have a fold similar to that of other Cys-loop ligand-gated ion channels and that amino acid 256 was unlikely to play a direct role in ligand binding but may be involved in mediating the allosteric properties of the receptor.

Ontogeny of serotonin and serotonin<sub>2A</sub> receptors in rat auditory cortex	HEARING RESEARCH			English	Article						Auditory cortex; High performance liquid chromatography; Immunocytochemistry; Serotonin; Serotonin(2A) receptors; Autoradiography	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; INTENSITY DEPENDENCE; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MESSENGER-RNA; RAPHE NUCLEI; EXPRESSION	Maturation of the mammalian cerebral cortex is, in part, dependent upon multiple coordinated afferent neurotransmitter systems and receptor-mediated cellular linkages during early postnatal development. Given that serotonin (5-HT) is one such system, the present study was designed to specifically evaluate 5-HT tissue content as well as 5-HT2A receptor protein levels within the developing auditory cortex (AC). Using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), 5-HT and the metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), was measured in isolated AC, which demonstrated a developmental dynamic, reaching young adult levels early during the second week of postnatal development. Radioligand binding of 5-HT2A receptors with the 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist, I-125-DOI ((+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane HCl; in the presence of SB206553, a selective 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, also demonstrated a developmental trend, whereby receptor protein levels reached young adult levels at the end of the first postnatal week (138), significantly increased at PI 0 and at PI 7, and decreased back to levels not significantly different from P8 thereafter. Immunocytochemical labeling of 5-HT2A receptors and confocal microscopy revealed that 5-HT2A receptors are largely localized on layer II/III pyramidal cell bodies and apical dendrites within AC. When considered together, the results of the present study suggest that 5-HT, likely through 5-HT2A receptors, may play an important role in early postnatal AC development. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Modulation of bladder function by prostaglandin EP<sub>3</sub> receptors in the central nervous system	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-RENAL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						rhythmic contraction; nociception; bladder distension	SPINAL NITRIC-OXIDE; LOWER URINARY-TRACT; GUINEA-PIG TRACHEA; PROSTANOID RECEPTORS; MICTURITION REFLEX; NOCICEPTIVE BEHAVIOR; THERMAL HYPERALGESIA; POLYMODAL RECEPTORS; OVERACTIVE BLADDER; OUTLET OBSTRUCTION	Prostaglandin EP3 receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) may exert an excitatory effect on urinary bladder function via modulation of bladder afferent pathways. We have studied this action, using two EP3 antagonists, (2E)-3-{1-[(2,4-dichlorophenyl) methyl]-5-fluoro-3-methyl- 1H-indol-7-yl}-N-[(4,5-dichloro-2-thienyl) sulfonyl]-2-propenamide (DG041) and (2E)-N-{[5-bromo-2-(methyloxy) phenyl] sulfonyl}-3-[2-(2-naphthalenylmethyl) phenyl]-2-propenamide (CM9). DG041 and CM9 were proven to be selective EP3 antagonists with radioligand binding and functional fluorescent imaging plate reader (FLIPR) assays. Their effects on volume-induced rhythmic bladder contraction and the visceromotor reflex (VMR) response to urinary bladder distension (UBD) were evaluated in female rats after intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration. Both DG041 and CM9 showed a high affinity for EP3 receptors at subnanomolar concentrations without significant selectivity for any splice variants. At the human EP3C receptor, both inhibited calcium influx produced by the nonselective agonist PGE(2). After intrathecal or intracerebroventricular administration both CM9 and DG041 dose-dependently reduced the frequency, but not the amplitude, of the bladder rhythmic contraction. With intrathecal administration DG041 and CM9 produced a long-lasting and robust inhibition on the VMR response to UBD, whereas with intracerebroventricular injection both compounds elicited only a transient reduction of the VMR response to bladder distension. These data support the concept that EP3 receptors are involved in bladder micturition at supraspinal and spinal centers and in bladder nociception at the spinal cord. A centrally acting EP3 receptor antagonist may be useful in the control of detrusor overactivity and/or pain associated with bladder disorders.	[Su, Xin; Leon, Lisa A.; Wu, Charlene W.; Hieble, J.

The amyloid-β rise and γ-secretase inhibitor potency depend on the level of substrate expression	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PRECURSOR-PROTEIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INTRAMEMBRANE CLEAVAGE; ZETA-CLEAVAGE; A-BETA; PRESENILIN; IDENTIFICATION; MUTATIONS; MECHANISM; BINDING	The amyloid-beta(A beta) peptide, which likely plays a key role in Alzheimer disease, is derived from the amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP) through consecutive proteolytic cleavages by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme and gamma-secretase. Unexpectedly gamma-secretase inhibitors can increase the secretion of A beta peptides under some circumstances. This "A beta rise" phenomenon, the same inhibitor causing an increase in A beta at low concentrations but inhibition at higher concentrations, has been widely observed. Here we show that the A beta rise depends on the beta-secretase-derived C-terminal fragment of APP (beta CTF) or C99 levels with low levels causing rises. In contrast, the N-terminally truncated form of A beta, known as "p3," formed by alpha-secretase cleavage, did not exhibit a rise. In addition to the A beta rise, low beta CTF or C99 expression decreased gamma-secretase inhibitor potency. This " potency shift" may be explained by the relatively high enzyme to substrate ratio under conditions of low substrate because increased concentrations of inhibitor would be necessary to affect substrate turnover. Consistent with this hypothesis, gamma-secretase inhibitor radioligand occupancy studies showed that a high level of occupancy was correlated with inhibition of A beta under conditions of low substrate expression. The A beta rise was also observed in rat brain after dosing with the gamma-secretase inhibitor BMS-299897. The A beta rise and potency shift are therefore relevant factors in the development of gamma-secretase inhibitors and can be evaluated using appropriate choices of animal and cell culture models. Hypothetical mechanisms for the A beta rise, including the "incomplete processing" and endocytic models, are discussed.

Methods: Radioligand binding assay for determining the density of muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes immunoblot analysis for assessing the characteristic of muscarinic cholinergic receptor Subtype protein and immunocytochemical techniques for investigating the cellular localization of receptors. Results: An increased expression of M2 and M5 receptor proteins was observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of allergic rhinitis patients in comparison with healthy control individuals. M3 receptor subtype decreased in allergic rhinitis patients with normal or mild responses to methacholine. A trend versus a return to normal Value was Found in moderate and severe responders. No changes of the M4 receptor Subtype were found. Conclusions and clinical implications: Increase in M2 receptor expression correlated with disease severity and bronchial hyperreactivity. Changes in muscarinic cholinergic receptor expression in allergic rhinitis underline a role of cholinergic system of immune cells ill allergic airway disease. Capsule summary: Studies addressed to rhinitis and asthma have identified many similarities. Our results indicate that Changes ill peripheral blood lymphocyte muscarinic receptor expression may reflect the cholinergic involvement into allergic airway diseases. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Regulation of dopamine transporter function and cell surface expression by D3 dopamine receptors	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROTEIN-KINASE-C; ELEMENT-BINDING PROTEIN; WILD-TYPE MICE; D-3 RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; PHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL 3-KINASE; DEPENDENT MECHANISM; PHORBOL ESTERS; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; NOREPINEPHRINE TRANSPORTER	D-3 dopamine receptors are expressed by dopamine neurons and are implicated in the modulation of presynaptic dopamine neurotransmission. The mechanisms underlying this modulation remain ill defined. The dopamine transporter, which terminates dopamine transmission via reuptake of released neurotransmitter, is regulated by receptor- and second messenger-linked signaling pathways. Whether D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function is unknown. We addressed this issue using a fluorescent imaging technique that permits real time quantification of dopamine transporter function in living single cells. Accumulation of the fluorescent dopamine transporter substrate trans-4-[4-(dimethylamino) styryl]-1-methylpyridinium (ASP(+)) in human embryonic kidney cells expressing human dopamine transporter was saturable and temperature-dependent. In cells co-expressing dopamine transporter and D3 receptors, the D2/D3 agonist quinpirole produced a rapid, concentration-dependent, and pertussis toxin-sensitive increase of ASP(+) uptake. Similar agonist effects were observed in Neuro2A cells and replicated in human embryonic kidney cells using a radioligand uptake assay in which binding to and activation of D3 receptors by [H-3] dopamine was prevented. D3 receptor stimulation activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase and MAPK. Inhibition of either kinase prevented the quinpirole-induced increase in uptake. D3 receptor activation differentially affected dopamine transporter function and subcellular distribution depending on the duration of agonist exposure. Biotinylation experiments revealed that the rapid increase of uptake was associated with increased cell surface and decreased intracellular expression and increased dopamine transporter exocytosis. In contrast, prolonged agonist exposure reduced uptake and transporter cell surface expression. These results demonstrate that D3 receptors regulate dopamine transporter function and identify a novel mechanism by which D3 receptors regulate extracellular dopamine concentrations.

Identification of previously unrecognized antiestrogenic chemicals using a novel virtual screening approach	CHEMICAL RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							SHAPE-SIGNATURES; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS; TOXICITY; DISCOVERY; HEALTH	The physiological roles of estrogen in sexual differentiation and development, female and male reproductive processes, and bone health are complex and diverse. Numerous natural and synthetic chemical compounds, commonly known as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), have been shown to alter the physiological effects of estrogen in humans and wildlife. As such, these EDCs may cause unanticipated and even undesirable effects. Large-scale in vitro and in vivo screening of chemicals to assess their estrogenic activity would demand a prodigious investment of time, labor, and money and would require animal testing on an unprecedented scale. Approaches in silico are increasingly recognized as playing a vital role in screening and prioritizing chemicals to extend limited resources available for experimental testing. Here. we evaluated a multistep procedure that is suitable for in silico (virtual) screening of large chemical databases to identify compounds exhibiting estrogenic activity. This procedure incorporates Shape Signatures, a novel computational tool that rapidly compares molecules on the basis of similarity in shape, polarity, and other bio-relevant properties. Using 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OH TAM) and diethylstilbestrol (DES) as input queries, we employed this scheme to search a sample database of similar to 200 000 commercially available organic chemicals for matches (hits). Of the eight compounds identified computationally as potentially (anti)estrogenic, biological evaluation confirmed two as heretofore unknown estrogen antagonists. Subsequent radioligand binding assays confirmed that two of these three compounds exhibit antiestrogenic activities comparable to 4-OH TAM. Molecular modeling studies of these ligands docked inside the binding pocket of estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha) elucidated key ligand-receptor interactions that corroborate these experimental findings. The present study demonstrates the utility of our computational scheme for this and related applications in drug discovery, predictive toxicology, and virtual screening	Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Pharmacol, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Inst Informat, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA; Univ Sci Philadelphia, Dept Chem & Biochem, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA; US EPA, Natl Risk Management Res Lab, Cincinnati, OH 45268 USA	Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences; Rutgers University System; Rutgers University New Brunswick; Rutgers University Biomedical & Health Sciences; United States Environmental Protection Agency	Welsh, WJ (corresponding author), Univ Med & Dent New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Pharmacol, 675 Hoes Lane, Piscataway, NJ 08854 USA.	welshwj@umdnj.edu			NLM NIH HHS [G08 LM006230-07, G08 LM06230, G08 LM006230] Funding Source: Medline	NLM NIH HHS(United States Department of Health & Human ServicesNational Institutes of Health (NIH) - USANIH National Library of Medicine (NLM))			24	33	38	0	13	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	0893-228X			CHEM RES TOXICOL	Chem.

Somatostatin receptors in wildtype and somatostatin deficient mice and their involvement in nitric oxide physiology in the retina	NEUROPEPTIDES			English	Article						neuropeptide; immunohistochemistry; NADPH-diaphorase; receptor autoradiography	RAT RETINA; MOUSE RETINA; NADPH-DIAPHORASE; RABBIT RETINA; GENETIC DELETION; EXPRESSION; SST(2); RELEASE; LOCALIZATION; SYNTHASE	The present study investigated the localization and density of somatostatin (SRIF) receptor subtypes (sst(1-5)) and SRIF-nitric oxide (NO center dot) interactions in the retina of wildtype [WT, (+/+)] and somatostatin deficient mice [SRIF Immunohistochemistry and radioligand binding studies with subsequent autoradiography were performed. Monoclonal antibodies [SRIF, protein kinase C (rod bipolar cells marker), microtubule associated protein 1A (ganglion cell marker)] and polyclonal antibodies (anti-sst(1), sst(2A), sst(4) receptor) were applied to 10-14 mu m sections of retinas fixed in paraformaldehyde. NADPH-diaphorase reactivity was assessed histochemically. [I-125]LTT SRIF-28 alone or in the presence of MK678 (sst(2) agonist) and [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide were employed to quantify sst(1-5), sst(1/4) and sst(2/5) receptor densities, respectively. sst(1), sst(2A), and sst(4) receptor immunoreactivities were observed in processes of the inner plexiform layer (IPL), rod bipolar, and in ganglion cells and processes, respectively, in WT and SRIF (-/-) mice. Specific [I-125]LTT SRIF-28 and [I-125]Tyr(3)-octreotide binding was increased significantly in SRIF (-/-) mice. NADPH-diaphorase staining was localized in photoreceptors and amacrine cells, but not rod bipolar and ganglion cells. Also, NADPH-diaphorase staining was not colocalized with sst(1), sst(2A) or sst(4) receptor immunoreactivity. These results demonstrate an upregulation of SRIF receptors in mice lacking SRIF, but no evident SRIF-NO, interaction was observed in the mouse retina. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To develop a peptidebased radiopharmaceutical, we investigated the properties of a peptide with affinity for human breast cancer, which has been selected through phage display. Experimental Design: The bioactivity of the p160 peptide (VPWMEPAYQRFL) was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. The specific binding to human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 cells was confirmed in competition experiments. Internalization of the peptide was investigated with confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the biodistribution of I-131-labeled p160 was studied in tumor-bearing mice. In vivo stability was evaluated at different periods after tracer administration using high-performance liquid chromatography analysis. Results: The binding of I-125-labeled p160 was inhibited up to 95% by the unlabeled pepticle with an IC50 value of 0.6 mu mol/L. In addition, 40% of the total bound activity was found to be internalized into the human breast cancer cells. Although a rapid degradation was seen, biodistribution studies in nude mice showed a higher uptake in tumor than in most of the organs. Perfusion of the animals caused a reduction of the radioligand accumulation in the healthy tissues, whereas the tumor uptake remained constant. A comparison of [I-131]p160 with a I-131-labeled Arg-Gly-Asp pepticle revealed a higher tumor-to-organ ratio for [I-131] p160. Conclusions: p160 has properties that make it an attractive carrier for tumor imaging and the intracellular delivery of isotopes or chemotherapeutic drugs.

We demonstrate here that expression of the tetraspanin CD82/KAI1 (a tumor metastasis suppressor) leads to a profound effect on uPAR function. Pericellular plasminogen activation was reduced by similar to 50-fold in the presence of CD82, although levels of components of the plasminogen activation system were unchanged. uPAR was present on the cell surface and molecularly intact, but radioligand binding analysis with uPA and anti-uPAR antibodies revealed that it was in a previously undetected cryptic form unable to bind uPA. This was not due to direct interactions between uPAR and CD82, as they neither co-localized on the cell surface nor could be co-immunoprecipitated. However, expression of CD82 led to a redistribution of uPAR to focal adhesions, where it was shown by double immunofluorescence labeling to co-localize with the integrin alpha(5)beta(1), which was also redistributed in the presence of CD82. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments showed that, in the presence of CD82, uPAR preferentially formed stable associations with alpha(5)beta(1), but not with a variety of other integrins, including alpha(3)beta(1). These data suggest that CD82 inhibits the proteolytic function of uPAR indirectly, directing uPAR and alpha(5)beta(1) to focal adhesions and promoting their association with a resultant loss of uPA binding. This represents a novel mechanism whereby tetraspanins, integrins, and uPAR, systems involved in cell adhesion and migration, cooperate to regulate pericellular proteolytic activity and may suggest a mechanism for the tumor-suppressive effects of CD82/KAI1.

The responsiveness of target cells to glucocorticoids is directly related to the number and the functional state of intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GR), which mediated the role of glucocorticoids. Although the effects of acute training on GR have been well characterized, less is known about the effects of chronic training on GR. The purpose of the present study was to describe the effects of long-term endurance training on GR. Methods. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 2 groups at random, 7 as controls and exercisers (swimming 40-50 min/day for 80 days), respectively. All rats were sacrificed 24 hours after their last training session for measurements of the GR in liver and brain cytosol and thymus cells by radioligand binding assay with H-3-dexamethasone. This study was also carried out on 8 trained adult, 8 aged as well as 6 retired athletes, whose GR in peripheral leukocytes were analyzed. Results. GR in hepatic cytosol and intact thymus cells of rats were significantly lower in exercise group than those in the controls. But the apparent dissociation constant (kd) was not changed. The GR in brain cytosol of rats indicated no significant reduction after training. The GR in peripheral leukocytes of the adult and aged athletes were also significantly lower than that in the controls. However, there was no significant difference between the GR in the retired athletes and that in the controls. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that long-term endurance training could lead to a decrease in GR and that the changes in GR were reversible during training. The possible mechanisms and the physiological significance of these changes need to be determined.

For chronic endurance training, rats were exposed to progressive running training on a motordriven treadmill for 3, 5 and 7 weeks, twice a day and 6 days a week. The samples were taken, 34-36 hours after the last exercise bout. Some of the 7-week training rats were killed by decapitation 7 days following the last exercise bout. The glucocorticoid receptors in hepatic cytosol in 5-week and 7-week rats decreased as compared to the sedentary control. There was no significant difference between the glucocorticoid receptors in hepatic cytosol in some of the 7-week rats those who had stopped training for 7 days and those in the controls. The chronic endurance training did not lead to change of the apparent dissociation constant (Kd). The changes of glucocorticoid receptors after acute exercise have also been investigated and it showed profound decreases of glucocorticoid receptors in renal and myocardial cytosol in low intensity (swimming without an extra weight for 60 minutes) and high intensity (swimming with a weight equal to 6% of body mass for 60 minutes) training groups. The decreases in glucocorticoid receptors in renal and myocardial cytosol were less prominent after low intensity training. These results demonstrated that both acute exercise training and chronic endurance training could lead to a decrease in glucocorticoid receptors, which was in a training intensity- and training load volume-dependent manner, and the changes in glucocorticoid receptors during exercise training were reversible.

Methods Twenty-eight patients with class III or IV advanced CHF due to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM) were randomly divided into groups A and B. L-thyroxine (L-T-50) was administered to group B. Exercise tolerance, chest X-rays, and echocardiographic parameters were obtained before and after one month of treatment, Ficoll-hypaque solution was used to separate peripheral lymphocytes, and I-125-pindolol radioligand binding was used to measure beta-AR levels in peripheral lymphocytes. Results L-T-50 therapy improved cardiac output [CO, (2.98+/-0.31)L/min vs (3.24+/-0.28)L/min, P<0.01], left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, 26.21%±3.21% vs 37.93%±9.01%, P<0.01), and decreased isovolumetric relaxation time (IVRT, 0.12+/-0.04 vs 0.10+/-0.02, P<0.01). Serum TH levels and the maximal number of β-AR binding sites (β(max)) in peripheral lymphocytes were lower in patients with CHF than in normal healthy people, but L-T-50 administration induced a β-AR upregulation on peripheral lymphocyte surfaces. L-T-50 was well tolerated without episodes of ischemia or arrhythmia. There was no significant change in heart rate or metabolic rate. Conclusion TH administration improves cardiac function and β-AR expression in peripheral lymphocytes of patients with CHF.

Up-regulation was independent of the expression vector used and was not prevented by cycloheximide or actinomycin D, eliminating several potential transcriptional mechanisms and new receptor protein synthesis. Antagonists were also able to induce up-regulation, suggesting that ligand occupancy without signal generation was sufficient to induce the increase in binding sites. Accordingly, we hypothesized that up-regulation results from ligand-induced protection from inherent instability of these mutated receptors. Studies with receptors in isolated membranes revealed that the two mutated receptors that exhibited up-regulation in intact cells also exhibited an inherent instability of their ligand binding capacity, and binding of either agonists or antagonists to these receptors could protect against the loss of binding. In contrast, the wildtype receptor and other mutated receptors that did not exhibit up-regulation in intact cells did not exhibit instability or ligand-induced protection in isolated membranes. The occurrence of instability and protection in isolated membranes for only those mutated receptors and ligands that exhibit up-regulation in intact cells provides compelling evidence that the apparent up-regulation of binding sites in intact cells results from ligand-induced protection from an inherent instability of these G protein coupling-defective receptors. Inclusion of protease inhibitors markedly reduced the loss of binding in isolated membranes, implicating membrane-localized proteolysis as the likely mechanism for the instability.

Rapacuronium, which sought to fulfill these criteria, was withdrawn from clinical use due to a high incidence of bronchospasm resulting in death. Understanding the mechanism by which rapacuronium induces fatal bronchospasm is imperative so that newly synthesized neuromuscular blocking agents that share this mechanism will not be introduced clinically. Selective inhibition of M2 muscarinic receptors by muscle relaxants during periods of parasympathetic nerve stimulation (e.g., intubation) can result in the massive release of acetylcholine to act on unopposed M3 muscarinic receptors in airway smooth muscle, thereby facilitating bronchoconstriction. Methods: Competitive radioligand binding determined the binding affinities of rapacuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, methoctramine (selective M2 antagonist), and 4-diphenylac-etoxy-N-methylpiperidine methiodide (4-DAMP; selective M3 antagonist) for M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors. Results: Rapacuronium competitively displaced H-3-QNB from the M2 muscarinic receptors but not from the M3 muscarinic receptors within clinically relevant concentrations. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations (mean SE) for rapacuronium were as follows: M2 muscarinic receptor, 5.10 +/- 1.5 muM (n = 6); M3 muscarinic receptor, 77.9 +/- 11 muM (n = 8). Cisatracurium and vecuronium competitively displaced H-3-QNB from both M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors but had affinities at greater than clinically achieved concentrations for these relaxants. Conclusions: Rapacuronium in clinically significant doses has a higher affinity for M2 muscarinic receptors as compared with M3 muscarinic receptors. A potential mechanism by which rapacuronium may potentiate bronchoconstriction is by blockade of M2 muscarinic receptors on prejunctional parasympathetic nerves, leading to increased release of acetylcholine and thereby resulting in M3 muscarinic receptor-mediated airway smooth muscle constriction.

These novel 3-indolylmethyl derivatives with ring-open (amines, sulfonamides, amides, ureas) and cyclic substituents (imidazolidin-2-ones, (thio)hydantoins) led to the discovery that compounds bearing a hydantoin substituent at the C-3 position of the indole nucleus are the most promising ones. In this series the hydantoins, ureas, and imidazolidin-2-ones were identified as very potent inhibitors of the binding of the glycine site specific ligand [H-3]MDL 105,519 to pig cortical brain membranes. Since the hydantoins can be produced via a versatile synthetic approach, further amendments of the hydantoin-substituted compounds were conducted to elucidate the influence of aromatic and aliphatic moieties at position 3 of the hydantoin as well as of sterically hindered compounds (5-substituted hydantoins). On the basis of the pharmacological data obtained in displacement experiments with [H-3]MDL 105,519 and the emerging structure-activity relationships, we confirm the existing pharmacophore model that suggests a hydrogen-bond acceptor and an aromatic substituent at position 3 of the indole as the key features for high affinity. Log P values indicate brain permeability and selected compounds showed anticonvulsant activity in vivo. Binding studies for the sodium channel (site 2) were also performed on some selected compounds.

Alverine citrate may possess visceral antinociceptive properties in a rat model of rectal distension-induced abdominal contractions. This study was designed to evaluate the pharmacological properties of alverine citrate in a rat model of rectal hyperalgesia induced by 5-HTP (5-HT precursor) and by a selective 5-HT1A agonist (8-OH-DPAT) and to compare this activity with a reference 5-HT1A antagonist (WAY 100635). At 4 h after their administration, 5-HTP and 8-OH-DPAT increased the number of abdominal contractions in response to rectal distension at the lowest volume of distension (0.4 mL). When injected intraperitoneally before 8-OH-DPAT and 5-HTP, WAY 100635 (1 mg kg(-1)) blocked their nociceptive effect, but also reduced the response to the highest volume of distension (11.6 mL). Similarly, when injected intraperitoneally, alverine citrate (20 mg kg-1) suppressed the effect of 5-HTP, but not that of 8-OH-DPAT. However, when injected intracerebroventricularly (75 mug/rat) alverine citrate reduced 8-OH-DPAT-induced enhancement of rectal distension-induced abdominal contractions. In-vitro binding studies revealed that alverine citrate had a high affinity for 5-HT1A receptors and a weak affinity for 5-HT3 and 5-HT(4)subtypes. These results suggest that 5-HTP-induced rectal hypersensitivity involves 5-TH1A receptors and that alverine citrate acts as a selective antagonist at the 5-HT1A receptor subtype to block both 5-HTP and 8-OH-DPAT-induced rectal hypersensitivity.

Using clonal human embryonic kidney 293 cell lines expressing recombinant hEP(1), affinity (K(i)), potency (EC(50)), and efficacy data were obtained using a radioligand competitive binding assay and an aequorin-based calcium functional assay. All compounds behaved as full agonists (90-100% of the response elicited by PGE(2)) in this assay, and the correlation between the K(i) and EC(50) values was highly significant (R(2) = 0.86). The results from the SAR analysis can be summarized as follows: 1) the existence and configuration of hydroxyl groups at the 11 and 15 positions of PGE(2) and prostanoid analog structures play a critical role in agonist activity; 2) the carboxyl group is also important for activity and modification of the carboxylic acid to various esters results in greatly reduced affinity and potency; 3) the activity of structures with moderate or weak potency can be enhanced by modification of the omega -tail; and 4) modifications to the ketone at the 9-position are better tolerated, with 9-deoxy-9-methylene-PGE(2) being the most potent agonist tested in the functional assay. The impact of other modifications on agonist potency is also discussed. The results from this study have identified, for the first time, the key structural features of PGE(2) and related prostanoids and prostanoid analogs necessary for activation of hEP(1).

The highest specific labeling was observed for layers I and IV of the cerebral cortex, the globus pallidus, and the medial septal nucleus/nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, Dose-dependent inhibition by endosulfan was highest in the nucleus accumbens and least in the cerebellum and periaqueductal gray matter. Fipronil had much less effect on binding even at severely toxic doses. AVM increased [H-3]EBOB binding in most regions and was the only one of the three agents inhibiting in vitro [H-3]strychnine binding to the glycine receptor. In summary, the noncompetitive blocker site was strongly inhibited with dose dependence and regional selectively by alpha-endosulfan but was generally poorly inhibited or activated by fipronil and was activated by avermectin, (C) 2000 Academic Press.

We have studied in anterior forebrain sections of SHR and Wistar-Kyoto Normotensive (WKY) controls the spatial distribution of neural markers such as: (i) dopamine (DA) D-1 and D-2 receptor families by radioligand binding studies; (ii) the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII); and (iii) the transcription regulators of gene expression (TFs) c-FOS and JUN-B by Immunocytochemistry (ICC). Microcomputer-assisted high-resolution image analysis showed in the SHR a higher density of DA D-1 receptors and a lower density of D-3 autoreceptors paralleled by a reduced number of elements positive for CaMKII and TFs in a restricted segment of the anterior forebrain that included the most rostral portions of the caudate-putamen, pole and shell of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. The differential rostro-caudal distribution of D-1 receptors and D-3 autoreceptors is discussed in the light of current hypotheses of DA mesocorticolimbic system functioning. In addition, the segmental defect was partially reversed by subchronic treatment with a DA re-uptake blocker, Methylphenidate (MPH; 3 mg/kg) and by environmental stimulation during the fifth and sixth postnatal week. The findings are consistent with the role of genetic determinants and environmental factors in the phenotypic expression of hyperactivity and attention deficit, (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Despite the growing number of ASOs in clinical development, there are still uncertainties regarding their dosing, primarily around their distribution and kinetics in the brain following intrathecal injection. The challenge of taking measurements within the delicate structures of the central nervous system (CNS) necessitates the use of non-invasive nuclear imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, an emergent strategy known as "pretargeted imaging" is applied to image the distribution of an ASO in the brain by developing a novel PET tracer, [F-18]F-537-Tz. This tracer is able to undergo an in vivo "click" reaction, covalently binding to a trans-cyclooctene conjugated ASO. Procedures A novel small molecule tracer for pretargeted PET imaging of ASOs in the CNS is developed and tested in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including biodistribution in rats and non-human primates. Results In vitro data and extensive in vivo rat data demonstrated delivery of the tracer to the CNS, and its successful ligation to its ASO target in the brain. In an NHP study, the slow tracer kinetics did not allow for specific binding to be determined by PET.

Probing thermostability of detergent-solubilized CB<sub>2</sub> receptor by parallel G protein?activation and ligand-binding assays	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						cannabinoid receptor; structural biology; drug screening; ligand-binding protein; G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR); cannabinoid receptor CB2; Facade?TEG detergent; G protein activation; G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR); thermostability	CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; FACIAL AMPHIPHILES; STABILIZATION; PURIFICATION; EXPRESSION; STABILITY; AFFINITY	G protein?coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large class of integral membrane proteins involved in the regulation of a broad spectrum of physiological processes and are a major target for pharmaceutical drug development. Structural studies can help advance the rational design of novel specific pharmaceuticals that target GPCRs, but such studies require expression of significant quantities of these proteins in pure, homogenous, and sufficiently stable form. An essential precursor for these structural studies is an assessment of protein stability under experimental conditions. Here we report that solubilization of a GPCR, type II cannabinoid receptor CB2, in a Fa?ade detergent enables radioligand thermostability assessments of this receptor with low background from nonspecific interactions with lipophilic cannabinoid ligand. Furthermore, this detergent is compatible with a [S-35]GTP?S radionucleotide exchange assay measuring guanine exchange factor activity that can be applied after heat treatment to further assess receptor thermostability. We demonstrate that both assays can be utilized to determine differences in CB2 thermostability caused by mutations, detergent composition, and the presence of stabilizing ligands. We report that a constitutively active CB2 variant has higher thermostability than the WT receptor, a result that differs from a previous thermostability assessment of the analogous CB1 mutation. We conclude that both ligand-binding and activity-based assays under optimized detergent conditions can support selection of thermostable variants of experimentally demanding GPCRs.

While both are suitable for detecting ligand activity (screening), differences are seen when these assays are used to quantitatively measure ligand parameters for therapeutic activity. Specifically, responses for Gq-related pathways present different and dissimulating patterns depending on the functional assay used to assess them. To investigate the impact of functional assays on the accuracy of compound pharmacological profiles, five exemplar molecules [partial agonist, antagonist, inverse agonist, positive allosteric modulator (PAM) agonist, and positive beta-PAM] targeting either muscarinic M1 or ghrelin receptors were tested using two functional assays (calcium release and IP1) and the results were compared with theoretical pharmacological models. The IP1 assay is an equilibrium assay that is able to determine the correct (i.e., internally consistent) pharmacological profiles of all tested compounds. In contrast, the nonequilibrium nature of calcium assays yields misleading classification of most of the tested compounds. Our study suggests that the use of an equilibrium assay, such as IP1, is mandatory for the optimal use of pharmacological models that can both identify mechanisms of action and also convert descriptive-to-predictive data for therapeutic systems. Such assays allow the identification of consistent and simple scales of activity that can guide medicinal chemistry in lead optimization of candidate molecules for therapeutic use.

So far, several lines of preclinical data and a single imaging study implicate a role for the serotoninlB (5-HTIB) receptor subtype. We sought to study 5-HTIB receptor binding in brain regions of reported relevance in patients with MDD. Subjects were examined at the Karolinska Institutet PET centre using positron emission tomography (PET) and the 5-HTIB receptor selective radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369. Ten drug -free patients with recurrent MDD and ten control subjects matched for age and sex were examined. The main outcome measure was [C-11]AZ10419369 binding in brain regions of reported relevance in the pathophysiology of MDD. The [C-11]AZ10419369 binding potential was significantly lower in the MDD group compared with the healthy control group in the anterior cingulate cortex (20% between-group difference), the subgenual prefrontal cortex (17% between-group difference), and in the hippocampus (32% between-group difference). The low anterior cingulate [C-11]AZ10419369 binding potential in patients with recurrent MDD positions 5-HTIB receptor binding in this region as a putative biomarker for MDD and corroborate a role of the anterior cingulate cortex and associated areas in the pathophysiology of recurrent MDD.

Circulating Exosomes Induced by Cardiac Pressure Overload Contain Functional Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptors	CIRCULATION			English	Article						beta-arrestin; exosomes; hypertension; receptors, angiotensin; signal transduction	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES; INTERCELLULAR TRANSFER; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; MECHANICAL-STRESS; BIASED AGONISM; MEMBRANE; MICE; MICROPARTICLES; COMMUNICATION	Background-Whether biomechanical force on the heart can induce exosome secretion to modulate cardiovascular function is not known. We investigated the secretion and activity of exosomes containing a key receptor in cardiovascular function, the angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R). Methods and Results-Exosomes containing AT1Rs were isolated from the media overlying AT1R-overexpressing cells exposed to osmotic stretch and from sera of mice undergoing cardiac pressure overload. The presence of AT1Rs in exosomes was confirmed by both electron microscopy and radioligand receptor binding assays and shown to require beta-arrestin2, a multifunctional adaptor protein essential for receptor trafficking. We show that functional AT1Rs are transferred via exosomes in an in vitro model of cellular stretch. Using mice with global and cardiomyocyte conditional deletion of beta-arrestin2, we show that under conditions of in vivo pressure overload the cellular source of the exocytosis of exosomes containing AT1R is the cardiomyocyte. Exogenously administered AT1R-enriched exosomes target cardiomyocytes, skeletal myocytes, and mesenteric resistance vessels and are sufficient to confer blood pressure responsiveness to angiotensin II infusion in AT1R knockout mice. Conclusions-AT1R-enriched exosomes are released from the heart under conditions of in vivo cellular stress to likely modulate vascular responses to neurohormonal stimulation. In the context of the whole organism, the concept of G protein-coupled receptor trafficking should consider circulating exosomes as part of the reservoir of functional AT1Rs.

Nucleophilic, no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) F-18-labelling of these ligands in an aromatic position is desirable for studying receptors with in vivo molecular imaging. 1-(4-[F-18]Fluorophenyl)piperazine was synthesized in two reaction steps starting by F-18-labelling of a iodobenzene-iodonium precursor, followed by Pd-catalyzed N-arylation of the intermediate 4-[F-18]fluoro-iodobenzene. Different palladium catalysts and solvents were tested with particular attention to the polar solvents dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Weak inorganic bases like potassium phosphate or cesium carbonate seem to be essential for the arylation step and lead to conversation rates above 70% in DMF which is comparable to those in typically used toluene. In DMSO even quantitative conversation was observed. Overall radiochemical yields of up to 40% and 60% in DMF and DMSO, respectively, were reached depending on the labelling yield of the first step. The fluorophenylpiperazine obtained was coupled in a third reaction step with 2-formyl-1H-indole-5-carbonitrile to yield the highly selective dopamine D-4 ligand [F-18]FAUC 316.

Cocaine Abuse in Humans Is Not Associated with Increased Microglial Activation: An 18-kDa Translocator Protein Positron Emission Tomography Imaging Study with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						[C-11]PBR28; cocaine dependence; inflammation; PET; TSPO	INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; PET RADIOLIGAND; HIGH-AFFINITY; HUMAN BRAIN; METHAMPHETAMINE; AMPHETAMINE; TSPO; NEUROINFLAMMATION	Basic science investigations have consistently shown that repeated exposure to psychostimulant drugs, such as cocaine, activate the immune response and lead to inflammatory changes in the brain. No previous in vivo studies have confirmed this observation in chronic cocaine-abusing humans. To test this hypothesis, we used positron emission tomography imaging to measure the binding of [C-11] PBR28 to the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a marker for microglial activation in a group of 15 recently abstinent cocaine abusers and 17 matched healthy controls. [C-11] PBR28 volumes of distribution expressed relative to total plasma ligand concentration (V-T) were measured in subjects with kinetic analysis using the arterial input function. Subjects were also genotyped for the TSPO alanine147 threonine (Ala147Thr, rs6971) polymorphism that has been shown to influence the in vivo binding of PBR28 to TSPO. Consistent with previous reports, the TSPO Ala147Thr genotype predicted the in vivo binding of [C-11] PBR28. No significant differences in [C-11] PBR28 V-T were observed in the cortical and subcortical regions in cocaine abusers compared with healthy controls. The results of this in vivo study do not support increased TSPO expression and, by extension, microglial activation in chronic cocaine-abusing humans. Further research with more direct markers of microglial activation is necessary to conclusively rule out neuroinflammation in cocaine dependence.

We evaluated two in vitro selective fluorine-18-labeled radioligand candidates ([F-18]5 and [F-18]6) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of D3 receptor availability in the brain. Methods: Biodistribution was evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats using ex vivo autoradiography and small-animal PET. Protein binding studies were conducted in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. Results: [F-18]5 showed rapid blood-brain barrier penetration and fast washout after intravenous injection, whereas the rat brain penetration of [F-18]6 was lower. The total distribution volume (V-T) of [F-18]5 was 20-26 mL g(-1) throughout brain. Co-injection with the D3 antagonist BP897 resulted in globally increased cerebral washout of [F-18]5 and [F-18]6, but SUV analysis and parametric mapping of binding potential (BPND) relative to the cerebellum did not reveal specific binding of either ligand in D3-rich brain regions, i.e. the ventral striatum. However, there was substantial displaceable binding of [F-18]5, and to a lesser extent [F-18]6, in the pituitary. Conclusion: These radioligands reveal dopamine D3 receptors in the pituitary, but are not suitable for PET imaging of in brain, possibly due to low specific signal relative to the globally high VT.

We previously reported that fenfluramine caused a dose-dependent reduction in specific binding in monkeys using a classical displacement paradigm with bolus administration of [C-11]AZ10419369. The aim of this study was to confirm our previous findings using an equilibrium approach in monkey. A total of 24 PET measurements were conducted using a bolus infusion protocol of [C-11]AZ10419369 in three cynomolgus monkeys. Initial PET measurements were performed to assess suitable K-bol values. The fenfluramine effect on [C-11]AZ10419369 binding was evaluated in a displacement and pretreatment paradigm. The effect of fenfluramine on [C-11]AZ10419369 binding potential (BPND) was dose-dependent in the displacement paradigm and confirmed in the pretreatment paradigm. After pretreatment administration of fenfluramine (5.0 mg/kg), the mean BPND of the occipital cortex decreased by 39%, from 1.38 +/- 0.04 to 0.84 +/- 0.09. This study confirms that the new 5-HT1B receptor radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 is sensitive to fenfluramine-induced changes in endogenous serotonin levels in vivo. The more advanced methodology is suitable for exploring the sensitivity limit to serotonin release as measured using [C-11]AZ10419369 and PET.

Effect of Fenoterol Stereochemistry on the β2 Adrenergic Receptor System: Ligand-Directed Chiral Recognition	CHIRALITY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	22nd International Symposium on Chirality	2010	Sapporo, JAPAN			G protein-coupled receptors; beta(2) adrenergic agonists; stereoselective binding; affinity; efficacy; Van't Hoff analysis	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; MOLECULAR-FIELD ANALYSIS; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; STEREOISOMERS; AGONISTS; BINDING; ADRENOCEPTOR; DERIVATIVES; ACTIVATION; SEPARATION	The beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)-AR) is a model system for studying the ligand recognition process in G protein-coupled receptors. Fenoterol (FEN) is a beta(2)-AR selective agonist that has two centers of chirality and exists as four stereoisomers. Radioligand binding studies determined that stereochemistry greatly influences the binding affinity. Subsequent Van't Hoff analysis shows very different thermodynamics of binding depending on the stereoconfiguration of the molecule. The binding of (S, x')-isomers is almost entirely enthalpy controlled whereas binding of (R, x')-isomers is purely entropy driven. Stereochemistry of FEN molecule also affects the coupling of the receptor to different G proteins. In a rat cardiomyocyte contractility model, (R, R')-FEN was shown to selectively activate Gs protein signaling while the (S, R')-isomer activated both G(i) and G(s) protein. The overall data demonstrate that the chirality at the two chiral centers of the FEN molecule influences the magnitude of binding affinity, thermodynamics of local interactions within the binding site, and the global mechanism of beta(2)-AR activation. Differences in thermodynamic parameters and nonuniform G-protein coupling suggest a mechanism of chiral recognition in which observed enantioselectivities arise from the interaction of the (R, x')-FEN stereoisomers with a different receptor conformation than the one with which the (S, x')-isomer interacts.

Evaluation of novel tropane analogues in comparison with the binding characteristics of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]FP-CIT and [<SUP>131</SUP>I]β-CIT	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						dopamine transporter; tropane derivatives; fluorinated radioligand; brain imaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; COCAINE RECOGNITION SITES; BETA-CIT-FP; OMEGA-FLUOROALKYL ANALOGS; IN-VITRO BINDING; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; HUMAN BRAIN; HIGH-AFFINITY; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTERS; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS	This study evaluated novel potential dopamine transporter (DAT) inhibitors as ligands for positron emission tomography. Five new tropane analogs were synthesized and compared with the known ligand 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (beta-CIT) and the recently characterized ligands N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-methylphenyl)-nortropane (PE21) and 2 beta-carbofluoroethoxy-3 beta-(4-methylphenyl)tropane (FETT). Evaluation with autoradiography measured the ability to antagonize the binding of [I-131]iodinelabeled beta-CIT and [F-18] fluorine-labeled N-(3-fluoropropyl)-2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-iodo-phenyl) nortropane in rat and pig brains. The standards for comparison (PE21 and FETT) competed strongly in all regions investigated (striatum, cortex, superior colliculus and cerebellum). Of the new compounds, 2 alpha-amido-fluoroethyl-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (4) and 2 beta-amido-fluoroethyl-3 beta-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (4a) competed strongly with [I-131]beta-CIT in DAT-rich striatum, but also in other brain regions suggesting poor DAT selectivity. Because [I-131]beta-CIT binds unselectively both to DAT and serotonin transporters, no definite conclusion about the selectivity of the new compounds is possible. However, preclinical studies using the compounds and labeled with fluorine-18 or iodine-131 are encouraged. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We employed site-directed mutagenesis to investigate the role of amino acids from the loop C region of the murine 5-HT3ASR in interacting with two structurally different agonists, serotonin (5-HT) and m-chlorophenylbiguanide (mCPBG). Mutant receptors were evaluated using radioligand binding, two-electrode voltage clamp, and immunofluorescence studies. Electrophysiological assays were employed to identify changes in response characteristics and relative efficacies of mCPBG and the partial agonist, 2-methyl 5-HT (2-Me5-HT). We have also constructed novel 5-HT and mCPBG docked models of the receptor binding site based on homology models of the AChBP. Both ligand-docked models correlate well with results from mutagenesis and electrophysiological assays. Four key amino acids were identified as being important to ligand binding and/or gating of the receptor. Among these, I228 and D229 are specific for effects mediated by 5-HT compared to mCPBG, indicating a differential interaction of these ligands with loop C. Residues F226 and Y234 are important for both 5-HT and mCPBG interactions. Mutations at F226,1228, and Y234 also altered the relative efficacies of agonists, suggesting a role in the gating mechanism.

The results indicate that the common digital artery possesses two beta-AR populations (40%beta(1) and 60%beta(2)) and the beta(2)-subtype appears to predominate as far as function is concerned. Only the beta(2)-AR agonists clenbuterol and fenoterol caused dose-related relaxant effects, antagonized by propranolol, when tested in preparations precontracted both with PGF(2alpha) (1.4 x 10(-5) <smallcapitals>m</smallcapitals>) and noradrenaline (1.2 x 10(-6) <smallcapitals>m</smallcapitals>). In noradrenaline precontracted preparations the beta(1)-AR selective agonists dobutamine and xamoterol caused vasodilation which was not antagonized by (+/-)propranolol. While the functional relaxant effects of dobutamine may be attributed to its potent competitive alpha-AR blocking activity, further investigations are required to explain the effect of xamoterol. The vasodilator effect of (+/-)isoproterenol was irregular. The recorded contractile effects, mainly at dosages greater than 10(-6) <smallcapitals>m</smallcapitals>, suggest the loss of drug selectivity for beta-AR and alpha-AR activation. Indirect evidence indicates that the alpha-adrenoceptor (alpha-AR) population in this tissue which produces a strong contraction is functionally dominant over the beta-AR, suggesting limited therapeutic benefit for beta-AR drugs to control blood flow disorders in the calf's distal limb.

The purpose of this study was to find ouabain-conjugated peptides (OCP) to block or to antagonize actions between endogenous ouabain (EO) and sodium pump, to serve as theoretical and experimental bases of EO in hypertension. Methods: The study involved screening the phage displayed 12-peptide library by biopanning for OCR The DNA sequence of each selected peptide was determined and the amino acid sequences were deduced. The highest consistent of the polypeptide was synthesized by peptide synthesizer. Synthetic OCP was identified, its binding activity determined by radioligand binding assay, and bioactivity of ouabain conjugated peptide was measured by erythrocyte Rb-86 uptake. Results: Three kinds of peptides were identified. Peptide A (12 peptide, Leu-Leu-Ala-Asp-Thr-Thr-His-His-Arg-Pro-Trp-Thr) was the highest consistence of peptide sequences, occupied in 66.7% (8/12). Peptide A was synthesized. The results verified that there was binding activity between synthetically OCP and H-3-ouabain, and that OCP was capable of suppressing the inhibition action between ouabain and sodium pump on the surface of erythrocyte. The results showed that efficacy was in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: It is important that the results not only obtain distinctive OCP, but also supply valuable experimental data in detection of ouabain and therapy in hypertension.

These peptides regulate important functions, including food intake, circadian rhythms, mood, blood pressure, intestinal secretion, and gut motility, through four receptors: Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5. Additional receptor subtypes have been proposed based on pharmacology observed in native tissues. Recent studies with other G-protein-coupled receptors have shown that homo- and heterodimerization may be important in determining receptor function and pharmacology. In the present study, the recently cloned rhesus ( rh) Y4 receptor was evaluated using radioligand binding, and the pharmacological profile was found to be very similar to the human Y4 receptor. To study homo- and heterodimerization involving the Y4 receptor using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2 ( BRET2), the carboxy termini of the rhesus Y1, Y2, Y4, and Y5 receptors were fused to Renilla luciferase, and rhY4 was also fused to green fluorescent protein. Dimerization was also studied using Western blot analysis. Using both BRET2 and Western analysis, we found that the rhY4 receptor is present at the cell surface as a homodimer. Furthermore, agonist stimulation using the Y4-selective agonists PP and 1229U91 can dissociate these dimers in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, rhY4 did not heterodimerize with other members of the NPY receptor family or with human opioid delta and mu receptors. Therefore, homodimerization is an important component in the regulation of the Y4 receptor.

In this study, we report the presence and distribution of 5-HT3, 5-HT5A and 5-HT7 receptor-like immunoreactivity in the rat cerebellum using immunofluorescence histochemistry. 5-HT3 immunoreactivity was found in fibers sparsely distributed throughout the cerebellum. Most of them were seen in the cerebellar cortex as fine varicose 5-HT3-positive axonal processes. 5-HT5A immunoreactivity, on the other hand, was observed in neuronal somata of the cerebellar cortex and deep cerebellar nuclei. Based upon cell morphology and the use of cell-specific markers, Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons and Golgi cells were found to be 5-HT5A immunopositive. In addition, the use of cell-specific markers allowed LIS to identify previously reported large 5-HT2A-positive cells in the granular layer as being Golgi cells. Finally, 5-HT7 immunoreactivity was observed only in Purkinje cells. Corroborating previous radioligand-binding, in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies, our data relate serotonin receptor subtypes to specific cerebellar cell types and may consequently contribute to the elucidation of serotonergic actions in the cerebellum.

In particular, the structural requirements necessary for adenosine A2B receptor recognition were investigated. These preliminary results confirm that the free amino group at the 5-position confers better A(2B) affinity, while the effect of the chain at nitrogen pyrazole nucleus, the 8-position, seems to be preferred with respect to the corresponding N-7 regioisomers. The introduction of an aminoacyl chain at the 5-amino group produces better selectivity for A(2B) receptors vs. A2A, but the compounds still remain more potent for A, and a significant decrease (about 5-fold) of affinity at A2B receptors was observed. Surprisingly, with these polar chains a good affinity at human A3 adenosine receptors was also detected. The most interesting compounds in binding studies proved to be potent antagonists (nM range) in functional assays, measuring the inhibition of cAMP production induced by 100 nM NECA.

The biochemical basis of such changes is poorly understood. Clinical trial data indicate that cholinomimetics improve noncognitive behaviors. This study investigated the relationship between markers of the cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems and noncognitive behavioral symptoms assessed during the course of dementing illness. Method: Brains from 46 patients with dementia (36 with AD and 10 with mixed or other dementias using Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD criteria) were examined together with 32 normal controls. The patients with dementia had been evaluated every 4 months, often over several years, for cognitive performance (Mini-Mental State Examination) and behavior (Present Behavioral Examination). Concentrations of dopamine (DA) and major metabolites, choline acetyltransferase activity (ChAT), and density (Bmax) of DA D1 receptors in frontal and temporal cortex were studied by radioligand binding protocols. None of the patients was receiving cholinomimetic drugs. Results: ChAT activity, but no other neurochemical markers, was reduced in AD compared with controls. Loss of ChAT activity correlated with cognitive impairment. Lowered ChAT activity also correlated with increasing overactivity in patients with dementia in both frontal and temporal cortex whereas ChAT:DA and ChAT:D1 ratios in temporal cortex correlated negatively with aggressive behavior. Conclusions: Disturbance of the cholinergic system may underlie both cognitive and some noncognitive behavioral changes in dementia, providing a basis for rational therapy.

However, it is not clear what type of opioid receptor mediates antinociception in non-mammalian vertebrates. Radioligand binding techniques were employed to characterize the site(s) of opioid action in the amphibian, Rana pipiens. Naloxone is a general opioid antagonist that has not been characterized in Rana pipiens. Using the non-selective opioid antagonist, [H-3]-naloxone, opioid binding sites were characterized in amphibian spinal cord. Competitive binding assays were done using selective opioid agonists and highly-selective opioid antagonists. Naloxone bound to a single-site with an affinity of 11.3 nM and 18.7 nM for kinetic and saturation studies, respectively. A B-max value of 2725 fmol/mg protein in spinal cord was observed. The competition constants (K-i) of unlabeled mu, kappa and delta ranged from 2.58 nM to 84 muM. The highly-selective opioid antagonists yielded similar K-i values ranging from 5.37 to 31.1 nM. These studies are the first to examine opioid binding in amphibian spinal cord. In conjunction with previous behavioral data, these results suggest that non-mammalian vertebrates express a unique opioid receptor which mediates the action of selective mu, kappa and delta opioid agonists.

These hCG derivatives include deglycosylated hCG, proteolytic digestion products of hCG and free alpha and beta subunits of the hormone. It is well documented that testicular Leydig cells are responsive to luteinising hormone (LH) or its analogue hCG. These hormones have high affinity for LH/hCG receptors on the plasma membrane. Methods: We designed functional and binding studies to compare the effects of native hCG and several hCG derivatives on a rat Leydig cell system. The molecular weight of the hCG derivatives was determined by SDS-PAGE and the binding affinity to LH/hCG receptors was measured by a radioligand assay. In addition, their ability to produce testosterone, cyclic AMP and arachidonic acid release was also studied. Results: These hCG derivatives, with the exception of the free beta subunit, were able to bind to LH/hCG plasma membrane receptors with different affinities than that of native hCG. In addition, hCG derivatives did not increase intracellular cAMP levels or arachidonic acid release. However, they did increase testosterone production. Conclusion: Taken together, the results of this study lead us to suggest that these hCG derivatives may regulate the action of the native hormone in Leydig cells and are, thus, molecules of physiological relevance.

The clinical activity of valbenazine is primarily attributed to its only dihydrotetrabenazine (HTBZ) metabolite, [+]-alpha-HTBZ. Deutetrabenazine is a deuterated form of tetrabenazine and is metabolized to four deuterated HTBZ metabolites: [+]-alpha-deuHTBZ, [+]-beta-deuHTBZ, [-]-alpha-deuHTBZ, and [-]-beta-deuHTBZ. An open-label, crossover study characterized the pharmacokinetic profiles of the individual deuHBTZ metabolites, which have not been previously reported. VMAT2 inhibition and off-target interactions of the deuHTBZ metabolites were evaluated using radioligand binding. The only valbenazine HTBZ metabolite, [+]-alpha-HTBZ, was a potent VMAT2 inhibitor, with negligible affinity for off-target dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic receptors. Following deutetrabenazine administration, [-]-alpha-deuHTBZ represented 66% of circulating deuHTBZ metabolites and was a relatively weak VMAT2 inhibitor with appreciable affinity for dopamine (D-2S, D-3) and serotonin (5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7) receptors. [+]-beta-deuHTBZ was the most abundant deuHTBZ metabolite that potently inhibited VMAT2, but it represented only 29% of total circulating deuHTBZ metabolites. The mean half-life of [+]-alpha-HTBZ (22.2 hours) was similar to 3x longer than that of [+]-beta-deuHTBZ (7.7 hours). These findings are similar to studies with tetrabenazine, in that deutetrabenazine is metabolized to four deuHTBZ stereoisomers, the most abundant of which has negligible interaction with VMAT2 in vitro and appreciable affinity for several off-target receptors. In contrast, valbenazine's single HTBZ metabolite is a potent VMAT2 inhibitor in vitro with no discernible off-target activity. Determination of the effects of intrinsic/extrinsic variables on deutetrabenazine's safety/efficacy profile should incorporate assessment of the effects on all deuHTBZ metabolites.

Two subpopulations of rodents spontaneously diverging in attention to enriched compartments (ED-Low and ED-High), were estimated on the basis of time spent by the mice in the empty or enriched compartments. The ED-Low and ED-High mice did not differ in parameters associated with anxiety, exploratory efficacy, and locomotor activity. Subchronic administration of both drugs in selected doses produced a corrective effect on animal behavior manifested as selective increase in the ED-ratio values in the ED-Low subpopulation (p < 0.05). The radioligand binding assays revealed differences in the distribution of dopamine D-2 and GABA(B) receptors (B.) in prefrontal cortex of control ED-Low and ED-High mice. In prefrontal cortex of ED-Low mice treatment with atomoxetine produced a decrease in the B-max values of D-2 receptors by 14%, while pantogam decreased the B-max values of D-2 receptors by 22% (p < 0.05) and increased the B-max values for GABA(B) receptor binding by 44%. Thus, subchronic administration of pantogam had a selective corrective effect on the behavior parameters and the density of the studied receptor subtypes in animals having had severe attention deficit in the test.

Impulse control disorders are associated with lower ventral striatum dopamine D3 receptor availability in Parkinson's disease: A [11C]-PHNO PET study	PARKINSONISM & RELATED DISORDERS			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; Dopaminergic receptor type 3; PHNO PET; Impulse control disorders	COMPULSIVE DISORDERS; TRANSPORTER; RELEASE; QUESTIONNAIRE; SENSITIZATION; SYMPTOMS; BINDING; SCALE	Introduction: Reduced postsynaptic D3 dopaminergic receptor availability has been reported in the ventral striatum of pathological gamblers without Parkinson's disease (PD) and in patients with PD and impulse control disorders (ICD). However, a direct relationship between ventral striatum D3 dopaminergic receptors and the severity of ICD in PD patients has not yet been proven using a validated tool for ICD in PD, such as the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS). In this pilot study, we investigated the relationship between ventral striatum D3 dopamine receptor availability and severity of impulse control disorder (ICD) in Parkinson's disease (PD). Methods: Twelve patients were assessed with PET and the high affinity dopamine D3 receptor radioligand [11C]PHNO. Severity of ICD was assessed with the QUIP-RS. Results: We found that lower ventral striatum D3 receptor availability measured with [11C]-PHNO PET was associated with greater severity of ICD, as measured by the QUIP-RS score (rho = -0.625, p = 0.03). Conclusion: These findings suggest that the occurrence and severity of ICD in Parkinson's disease may be linked to reductions in ventral striatum dopamine D3 receptor availability. Further studies in larger cohort of patients need to be performed in order to confirm our findings and clarify whether lower ventral striatum D3 receptor may reflect a pharmacological downregulation to higher dopamine release in ventral striatum of patients with ICD or a patients' predisposition to ICD.

However, the mechanism by which Cl- exerts its influence is unknown. To examine the role that Cl- plays in the transport cycle, we measured the effect of Cl- on both glycine binding and conformational changes. The ability of glycine to displace the high-affinity radioligand [H-3]CHIBA-3007 required Na+ and was potentiated over 1,000-fold by Cl-. We generated GlyT1b mutants containing reactive cysteine residues in either the extracellular or cytoplasmic permeation pathways and measured changes in the reactivity of those cysteine residues as indicators of conformational changes in response to ions and substrate. Na+ increased accessibility in the extracellular pathway and decreased it in the cytoplasmic pathway, consistent with stabilizing an outward-open conformation as observed in other members of this transporter family. In the presence of Na+, both glycine and Cl- independently shifted the conformation of GlyT1b toward an outward-closed conformation. Together, Na+, glycine, and Cl- stabilized an inward-open conformation of GlyT1b. We then examined whether Cl- acts by interacting with a conserved glutamine to allow formation of an ion pair that stabilizes the closed state of the extracellular pathway. Molecular dynamics simulations of a GlyT1 homolog indicated that this ion pair is formed more frequently as that pathway closes. Mutation of the glutamine blocked the effect of Cl-, and substituting it with glutamate or lysine resulted in outward- or inward-facing transporter conformations, respectively. These results provide an unexpected insight into the role of Cl- in this family of transporters.

Looking for Drugs in All the Wrong Places: Use of GCPII Inhibitors Outside the Brain	NEUROCHEMICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						GCPII; PSMA; Folate hydrolase; Prostate cancer; Inflammatory bowel disease; Theranostics	GLUTAMATE-CARBOXYPEPTIDASE-II; LINKED ACIDIC DIPEPTIDASE; RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; ASPARTYL-L-GLUTAMATE; LU-177-PSMA RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; TARGETED RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN-EXPRESSION; GA-68-PSMA PET/CT; PSMA-EXPRESSION; N-ACETYLASPARTYLGLUTAMATE	In tribute to our friend and colleague Michael Robinson, we review his involvement in the identification, characterization and localization of the metallopeptidase glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII), originally called NAALADase. While Mike was characterizing NAALADase in the brain, the protein was independently identified by other laboratories in human prostate where it was termed prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and in the intestines where it was named Folate Hydrolase 1 (FOLH1). It was almost a decade to establish that NAALADase, PSMA, and FOLH1 are encoded by the same gene. The enzyme has emerged as a therapeutic target outside of the brain, with the most notable progress made in the treatment of prostate cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). PSMA-PET imaging with high affinity ligands is proving useful for the clinical diagnosis and staging of prostate cancer. A molecular radiotherapy based on similar ligands is in trials for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. New PSMA inhibitor prodrugs that preferentially block kidney and salivary gland versus prostate tumor enzyme may improve the clinical safety of this radiotherapy. The wide clinical use of PSMA-PET imaging in prostate cancer has coincidentally led to clinical documentation of GCPII upregulation in a wide variety of tumors and inflammatory diseases, likely associated with angiogenesis. In IBD, expression of theFOLH1gene that codes for GCPII is strongly upregulated, as is the enzymatic activity in diseased patient biopsies. In animal models of IBD, GCPII inhibitors show substantial efficacy, suggesting potential theranostic use of GCPII ligands for IBD.

Amyloid-beta (A beta) plaques are well described in PDD but their contribution in synucleinopathies is still controversial. Objective: To investigate regional [F-18] Florbetapir binding and its relative contribution to cognitive dysfunction in a cohort of PDD patients and to test whether PDD patients with comorbid amyloidopathy have different clinical and neuropsychological characteristics. Methods: 21 PDD patients, 20 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 9 control subjects underwent amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, neurological, and neuropsychological assessment. Radioligand binding was compared across the groups. PDD scans were interpreted qualitatively and semiquantitatively and categorized as positive or negative. Annual longitudinal Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of PDD subjects was retrospectively collected in order to relate A beta burden to the course of cognitive impairment. Results: [F-18] Florbetapir PET imaging was positive in 11 PDD patients (52.38%) using the semi-quantitative method. There were no group differences between PDD subjects with increased cortical [F-18] Florbetapir (+) and those without (-), according to demographic and clinical parameters. PDD+ performed worse on Digit Span Foward and on Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall than the PDD- with a significant negative correlation between global cortical retention and specific memory tests. A beta load did not correlate with MMSE ratings although PDD+ demonstrated a faster clinical progression of dementia. Conclusions: Significant A beta deposition is common in PDD patients contributing to memory impairment and driving a faster rate of cognitive decline.

Human erectile tissue contains predominantly alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors, and here we examined whether contractions of this tissue are mediated by the functional phenotype, the alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor. Functional experiments using subtype selective agonists and antagonists, along with radioligand ([H-3] tamsulosin) binding assays, were used to determine the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor population. A61603, a alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor agonist, was a full agonist with a potency 21-fold greater than that of noradrenaline. The alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist tamsulosin antagonized noradrenaline responses with high affinity (pK(D) = 9.7 +/- 0.3), whilst BMY7378 (100 nM) (alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist) failed to antagonize responses. In contrast, relatively low affinity estimates were obtained for both prazosin (pK(D) = 8.2 +/- 0.1) and RS17053 (pK(D) = 6.9 +/- 0.2), antagonists which discriminate between the alpha(1A)- and alpha(1L)-adrenoceptors. [3H] Tamsulosin bound with high affinity to the receptors of human erectile tissue (pK(D) = 10.3 +/- 0.1) with a receptor density of 28.1 +/- 1.4 fmol mg(-1) protein. Prazosin displacement of [3H] tamsulosin binding revealed a single homogenous population of binding sites with a relatively low affinity for prazosin (pK(i) = 8.9). Taken together these data confirm that the receptor mediating contraction in human erectile tissue has the pharmacological properties of the alpha(1L)-adrenoceptor. (c) 2018 The Authors.

PET imaging of dopamine-D2 receptor internalization in schizophrenia	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ORAL D-AMPHETAMINE; IN-VIVO; SUBJECTIVE RESPONSES; AGONIST RADIOTRACER; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; HIGH-AFFINITY; BASE-LINE; RELEASE; TRANSMISSION	Recent genetic, molecular and post-mortem studies suggest impaired dopamine (DA)-D2 receptor (D2R) trafficking in patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Imaging and preclinical studies have shown agonist-induced D2R internalization can be imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) using D2R radiotracers combined with psychostimulant challenge. This is feasible if radiotracer binding is measured when postchallenge DA levels have returned to baseline, following the initial competition phase between DA and radiotracer for binding to D2R. Here we used 'late-phase' imaging after challenge to test the hypothesis that impaired D2R internalization in SZ leads to blunted late-phase displacement, or a faster return to baseline, in patients compared with healthy controls (HCs). We imaged 10 patients with SZ and 9 HCs with PET and [C-11] raclopride at baseline and two times (3-5 and 6-10 h) following 0.5 mg kg(-1) dextroamphetamine. We measured binding potential relative to non-displaceable compartment (BPND) and derived percent reduction from baseline (Delta BPND) for each postamphetamine scan. To test the hypothesis that time course of return of striatal BPND to baseline differed between SZ and HCs, we implemented a linear model with Delta BPND as dependent variable, time after amphetamine as repeated measure and time after amphetamine and diagnostic group as fixed effects. Neither diagnostic group nor interaction of diagnostic group-by-time after amphetamine significantly affected striatal.BPND (F = 1.38, P = 0.26; F = 0.51, P = 0.61). These results show similar pattern of return of BPND to baseline as a function of time in patients with SZ and HC, suggesting that striatal D2R internalization as measured by our imaging paradigm is normal in patients with SZ.

We now investigate the efficacy of two novel, potent and chemically distinct NOP receptor agonists, AT-390 and AT-403, to improve Parkinsonian disabilities and attenuate dyskinesia development and expression. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Binding affinity and functional efficacy of AT-390 and AT-403 at the opioid receptors were determined in radioligand displacement assays and in GTPS binding assays respectively, conducted in CHO cells. Their anti-Parkinsonian activity was evaluated in 6-hydroxydopamine hemi-lesioned rats whereas the anti-dyskinetic properties were assessed in 6-hydroxydopamine hemi-lesioned rats chronically treated with levodopa. The ability of AT-403 to inhibit the D-1 receptor-induced phosphorylation of striatal ERK was investigated. KEY RESULTS AT-390 and AT-403 selectively improved akinesia at low doses and disrupted global motor activity at higher doses. AT-403 palliated dyskinesia expression without causing sedation in a narrow therapeutic window, whereas AT-390 delayed the appearance of abnormal involuntary movements and increased their duration at doses causing sedation. AT-403 did not prevent the priming to levodopa, although it significantly inhibited dyskinesia on the first day of administration. AT-403 reduced the ERK phosphorylation induced by SKF38393 in vitro and by levodopa in vivo. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS NOP receptor stimulation can provide significant albeit mild anti-dyskinetic effect at doses not causing sedation. The therapeutic window, however, varies across compounds. AT-403 could be a potent and selective tool to investigate the role of NOP receptors in vivo.

First assumed that the compound was acting via cannabinoid CB2 receptors (CB(2)Rs) it is now suggested that it interacts with non-cannabinoid G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); however, CBD does not bind with high affinity to the orthosteric site of any GPCR. To search for alternative explanations, we tested CBD as a potential allosteric ligand of CB2R. Radioligand and non-radioactive homogeneous binding, intracellular cAMP determination and ERK1/2 phosphorylation assays were undertaken in heterologous systems expressing the human version of CB2R. Using membrane preparations from CB2R-expressing HEK-293T (human embryonic kidney 293T) cells, we confirmed that CBD does not bind with high affinity to the orthosteric site of the human CB2R where the synthetic cannabinoid, [H-3]-WIN 55,212-2, binds. CBD was, however, able to produce minor but consistent reduction in the homogeneous binding assays in living cells using the fluorophore-conjugated CB2R-selective compound, CM-157. The effect on binding to CB2R-expressing living cells was different to that exerted by the orthosteric antagonist, SR144528, which decreased the maximum binding without changing the K-D. CBD at nanomolar concentrations was also able to significantly reduce the effect of the selective CB2R agonist, JWH133, on forskolin-induced intracellular cAMP levels and on activation of the MAP kinase pathway. These results may help to understand CBD mode of action and may serve to revisit its therapeutic possibilities.

Pharmacological evaluation of synthetic cannabinoids identified as constituents of spice	FORENSIC TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Synthetic cannabinoid; Structure-activity relationship; GPR18; GPR55; Indazoles; Indoles	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; CB2 RECEPTORS; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; INTERNATIONAL UNION; GPR55; ANTAGONISTS; AGONISTS; DERIVATIVES; INDOLES; ACTIVATION	In recent years, many synthetic cannabinoid (CB) receptor agonists have appeared on the market as constituents of herbal incense mixtures known as "spice". Contrary to the declared use, they are perorally consumed as a replacement for marijuana to get "high". In many cases, detailed information on the physicochemical and pharmacological properties of the synthetic compounds found in spice preparations is lacking. We have now evaluated a large series of heterocyclic compounds, 1,3-disubstituted indole and 2-azaindole derivatives known or assumed to be CB1 receptor agonists, many of which have previously been identified in forensic samples. The mainly observed structural variations to circumvent restriction by law were bioisosteric exchanges of functional groups in known CB1 agonists. We analyzed the structure-activity relationships of compounds at human CB1 and CB2 receptors based on affinities obtained in radioligand binding studies, and determined their efficacy in cAMP accumulation assays. Moreover, we investigated the activities of the compounds at the orphan G protein-coupled receptors GPR18 and GPR55 both of which are known to interact with cannabinoids. Most of the investigated compounds behaved as potent full agonists of CB1 and CB2 receptors with affinities in the low nanomolar to subnanomolar concentration range. Some compounds were moderately potent GPR55 antagonists, while none interacted with GPR18. Most derivatives were predicted to cross the blood-brain barrier as determined by bioinformatics tools. These data are useful for assessing synthetic cannabinoids and will be helpful for predicting pharmacological properties of novel compounds that appear on the illicit drug market.

EFFECTS OF SYNTHETIC ANALOGUES OF HUMAN OPIORPHIN ON RAT BRAIN OPIOID RECEPTORS	JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						opioid receptors; radioligand binding; Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe; rat brain membranes; peptidase inhibition	MEMBRANE PREPARATIONS; BINDING; PHOSPHORAMIDON; HYDROLYSIS; AMASTATIN; CAPTOPRIL; PATHWAYS	Human opiorphin (Gln-Arg-Phe-Ser-Arg; QRFSR-peptide) is a physiological inhibitor of enkephalin-inactivating peptidases. We previously demonstrated that opiorphin can substitute for the classic mixture of peptidase inhibitors and greatly improves the specific binding and affinity of the enkephalin-related peptide [H-3]MERF (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met-Arg-Phe; YGGFMRF) for rat brain opioid receptors. To extend the metabolic stability of opiorphin in human plasma two functional derivatives were designed, i.e., Cys-[(CH2)(6)]-QRF-[Ser-O-octanoyl]-R peptide (monomeric CC6-opiorphin) and its cystine-dipeptide (dimeric CC6-opiorphin) derivative. We found that, in homologous competition experiments, the affinity of [H-3]MERF for rat brain opioid receptors was significantly increased in the presence of monomeric and dimeric CC6-opiorphin, compared to control-Tris buffer. In addition ten times lower concentrations (5 mu M) than those required for native opiorphin (50 mu M) were sufficient. In heterologous competition experiments, using unlabeled dynorphin((1-10)), affinity increases were also observed: increases in binding were similar with either monomeric or dimeric CC6-opiorphin. Surprisingly, these opiorphin analogues displayed weak competitive effects on [H-3]MERF binding to rat brain opioid receptors in the absence of unlabeled MERF, effects never observed for the native opiorphin. In conclusion, CC6-opiorphin compounds are certainly more potent than the native opiorphin in increasing the binding and the affinity of homologous and heterologous competition, but the binding enhancement occurs only at temperatures much higher than 0 degrees C, specifically at 24 degrees C.

In anesthesia, the soft drug is useful because it enables precise titration to effect and rapid recovery, which might allow swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness and early home readiness. Propofol may cause delayed awakening after prolonged infusion. Propanidid and AZD3043 have a different metabolic pathway compared to propofol, resulting in a short-acting clinical profile. Fluorine imparts a variety of properties to certain medicines, including an enhanced absorption rate and improved drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. We hypothesized that the introduction of fluorine to the frame structure of propanidid and AZD3043 would further accelerate the swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness. To test this hypothesis, we developed a series of fluorine-containing phenyl acetate derivatives. Methodology/Principal Findings: Fluorine-containing phenyl acetate derivatives were synthesized, and their hypnotic potencies and durations of LORR following bolus or infusion administration were determined in mice, rats and rabbits. The metabolic half-lives in the blood of various species were determined chromatographically. In vitro radioligand binding and c-aminobutyric acidA (GABAA) receptor electrophysiology studies were performed. Among the 12 synthesized fluorine-containing phenyl acetate derivatives, compound 5j induced comparable duration of LORR with AZD3043, but more rapid recovery than AZD3043, propanidid and propofol. The time of compound 5j to return to walk and behavioral recovery are approximately reduced by more than 50% compared to AZD3043 in mice and rats and rabbits. The HD50 of compound 5j decreased with increasing animal size. Conclusions/Significance: The rapid recovery might make compound 5j suitable for precise titration and allow swift and clear-headed recovery of consciousness and early home readiness.

However, the precise subtype composition has not been clarified. We characterized the pharmacological profile of mAChRs on mouse colonic crypts, employing [H-3]-N-methyl scopolamine chloride as a radioligand and several subtype-selective chemicals, and the functional aspect by measuring short-circuit current (I (sc)) in Ussing chambers and by evaluating MAP kinase phosphorylation in mouse colonic mucosal sheets. The mAChRs were detected on the crypts (K (d) = 163.2 +/- A 32.3 pM, B (max) = 47.3 +/- A 2.6 fmol/mg of total cell protein). Muscarinic toxin 7 (MT-7, M1 subtype selective) gave a displacement curve with high affinity, but there was a part insensitive to MT-7 (18.8 +/- A 0.4 % of the total specific binding). The MT-7-insensitive component was displaced completely by darifenacin (M3 selective) with high affinity. ACh induced an increase in I (sc), which was significantly enhanced by MT-7 but was completely inhibited by darifenacin or atropine. Colitis induction resulted in a significant decrease in the density of mAChRs, which occurred mainly in the MT-7-sensitive component (M1 subtype). Immunological experiments exhibited a reduction of M1 but not of M3 signal after colitis induction. Muscarinic stimulation induced an increase in MAP kinase phosphorylation, which was completely suppressed by MT-7 and was attenuated by inflammation, in mouse colonic epithelium. These results suggest that mAChRs in mouse colonic epithelial cells consist of two subtypes, M1 (80 %) and M3 (20 %). The major M1 subtype was likely to regulate epithelial chloride secretion negatively and was susceptible to inflammation and may be relevant to inflammatory gut dysfunction.

Cell-free protein synthesis and purification of human dopamine D2 receptor long isoform	BIOTECHNOLOGY PROGRESS			English	Article						cell-free protein; dopamine D2 receptor; GPCR; protein expression; protein purification	LARGE-SCALE PRODUCTION; FREE EXPRESSION SYSTEMS; INTEGRAL MEMBRANE-PROTEINS; COUPLED RECEPTORS; ESCHERICHIA-COLI; WHEAT-GERM; BINDING; SCHIZOPHRENIA	The human dopamine D2 receptor long isoform (D2L) has significant implications in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. Detailed structural knowledge of this receptor is limited owing to its highly hydrophobic nature, which leads to protein aggregation and host toxicity when expressed in cellular systems. The newly emerging field of cell-free protein expression presents numerous advantages to overcome these challenges. This system utilizes protein synthesis machinery and exogenous DNA to synthesize functional proteins outside of intact cells. This study utilizes two different cell-free systems for the synthesis of human dopamine D2L receptor. These include the Escherichia coli lysate-based system and the wheat-germ lysate-based system. The bacterial cell-free method used pET 100/D-TOPO vector to synthesize hexa-histidine-tagged D2L receptor using a dialysis bag system; the resulting protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity resin. The wheat germ system used pEU-glutathione-S-transferase (GST) vector to synthesize GST-tagged D2L receptor using a bilayer translation method; the resulting protein was purified using a GST affinity resin. The presence and binding capacity of the synthesized D2L receptor was confirmed by immunoblotting and radioligand competition assays, respectively. Additionally, in-gel protein sequencing via Nano LC-MS/MS was used to confirm protein synthesis via the wheat germ system. The results showed both systems to synthesize microgram quantities of the receptor. Improved expression of this highly challenging protein can improve research and understanding of the human dopamine D2L receptor. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Nonuniform Cardiac Denervation Observed by <SUP>11</SUP><i>C</i>-<i>meta</i>-Hydroxyephedrine PET in 6-OHDA-Treated Monkeys	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; NONMOTOR SYMPTOMS QUESTIONNAIRE; PURE AUTONOMIC FAILURE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SYMPATHETIC DENERVATION; CHEMICAL SYMPATHECTOMY; ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION; HEART-TRANSPLANTATION; RHESUS-MONKEYS; 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE	Parkinson's disease presents nonmotor complications such as autonomic dysfunction that do not respond to traditional anti-parkinsonian therapies. The lack of established preclinical monkey models of Parkinson's disease with cardiac dysfunction hampers development and testing of new treatments to alleviate or prevent this feature. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of developing a model of cardiac dysautonomia in nonhuman primates and preclinical evaluations tools. Five rhesus monkeys received intravenous injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (total dose: 50 mg/kg). The animals were evaluated before and after with a battery of tests, including positron emission tomography with the norepinephrine analog C-11-meta-hydroxyephedrine. Imaging 1 week after neurotoxin treatment revealed nearly complete loss of specific radioligand uptake. Partial progressive recovery of cardiac uptake found between 1 and 10 weeks remained stable between 10 and 14 weeks. In all five animals, examination of the pattern of uptake (using Logan plot analysis to create distribution volume maps) revealed a persistent region-specific significant loss in the inferior wall of the left ventricle at 10 (P<0.001) and 14 weeks (P<0.01) relative to the anterior wall. Blood levels of dopamine, norepinephrine (P<0.05), epinephrine, and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (P<0.01) were notably decreased after 6-hydroxydopamine at all time points. These results demonstrate that systemic injection of 6-hydroxydopamine in nonhuman primates creates a nonuniform but reproducible pattern of cardiac denervation as well as a persistent loss of circulating catecholamines, supporting the use of this method to further develop a monkey model of cardiac dysautonomia.

However, it is largely unknown which of the six alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes are actually present in human nasal mucosa, which are activated by the two alpha-adrenoceptor agonists and to what extent. Therefore, mRNA expression in human nasal mucosa of the six alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes was studied. Furthermore, the affinity and potency of the imidazolines oxymetazoline and xylometazoline at these alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes were examined in transfected HEK293 cells. The rank order of mRNA levels of alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes in human nasal mucosa was: alpha(2A) > alpha(1A) >= alpha(2B) > alpha(1D) >= alpha(2C) >> alpha(1B). Oxymetazoline and xylometazoline exhibited in radioligand competition studies higher affinities than the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline at most alpha-adrenoceptor subtypes. Compared to xylometazoline, oxymetazoline exhibited a significantly higher affinity at alpha(1A)- but a lower affinity at alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors. In functional studies in which adrenoceptor-mediated Ca2+ signals were measured, both, oxymetazoline and xylometazoline behaved at alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors as full agonists but oxymetazoline was significantly more potent than xylometazoline. Furthermore, oxymetazoline was also a partial agonist at alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors; however, its potency was relatively low and it was much lower than its affinity. The higher potency at alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors, i.e. at receptors highly expressed at the mRNA level in human nasal mucosa, could eventually explain why in nasal decongestants oxymetazoline can be used in lower concentrations than xylometazoline.

A single nucleotide polymorphism in the first extracellular loop (I107) increases the potency of neuropeptide S and has been identified for both the human neuropeptide S receptor short (A) and long (B) C-terminal forms. Preliminary human genetic studies link this polymorphism to asthma, panic disorders and altered sleep behavior. No polymorphism or splice variants have been reported for the rat neuropeptide S receptor, however it carries an isoleucine at position 107. To identify a suitable tracer for neuropeptide S receptor binding and investigate the role of specific amino acids within neuropeptide S we carried out mutagenesis of the peptide and assessed the ability of the mutations to stimulate calcium release in HEK293 cells expressing human neuropeptide S receptor variants (A, B, AI(107), BI107) and rat neuropeptide S receptor. Replacement of threonine at position 8 by arginine and methionine at position 10 by tyrosine resulted in a mutant peptide slightly more potent on all neuropeptide S receptor variants compared to neuropeptide S and more importantly the iodinated mutant peptide was found to be a suitable tracer for binding studies with improved signal to noise ratio and stability compared to [I-125-Y-10], neuropeptide S. Replacement of serine at position 1 of neuropeptide S peptide by arginine resulted in a complete loss of potency for the neuropeptide S receptor (long and short form) but not for the I-107 receptor variants (long and short) or rat neuropeptide S receptor.

Cloning and pharmacological characterization of the dog P2X7 receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2X7 receptor; human; dog; whole blood; BzATP; KN62; CBB; GW791343; compound-17	HUMAN P2X(7) RECEPTOR; PORE FORMATION; DEPENDENT DIFFERENCES; C-TERMINUS; POLYMORPHISM; ATP; GENE; EXPRESSION; CELLS; IDENTIFICATION	Background and purpose: Human and rodent P2X7 receptors exhibit differences in their sensitivity to antagonists. In this study we have cloned and characterized the dog P2X7 receptor to determine if its antagonist sensitivity more closely resembles the human or rodent orthologues. Experimental approach: A cDNA encoding the dog P2X7 receptor was isolated from a dog heart cDNA library, expressed in U-2 OS cells using the BacMam viral expression system and characterized in electrophysiological, ethidium accumulation and radioligand binding studies. Native P2X7 receptors were examined by measuring ATP-stimulated interleukin-1 beta release in dog and human whole blood. Key results: The dog P2X7 receptor was 595 amino acids long and exhibited high homology (> 70%) to the human and rodent orthologues although it contained an additional threonine at position 284 and an amino acid deletion at position 538. ATP possessed low millimolar potency at dog P2X7 receptors. 2'-&3'-O-(4benzoylbenzoyl) ATP had slightly higher potency but was a partial agonist. Dog P2X7 receptors possessed relatively high affinity for a number of selective antagonists of the human P2X7 receptor although there were some differences in potency between the species. Compound affinities in human and dog blood exhibited a similar rank order of potency as observed in studies on the recombinant receptor although absolute potency was considerably lower. Conclusions and implications: Dog recombinant and native P2X7 receptors display a number of pharmacological similarities to the human P2X7 receptor. Thus, dog may be a suitable species for assessing target-related toxicity of antagonists intended for evaluation in the clinic.	[Roman, S.; Fonfria, E.; Goodwin, J. A.; Reeves, J.; Lappin, S.

We herein report the synthesis of [F-18]FDG-RGD (F-18 labeled linear RGD) and [F-18]FDG-cyclo(RGD(D)YK) (F-18 labeled cyclic RGD) as examples of the use of [F-18]FDG. We have successfully prepared [F-18]FDG-RGD and [F-18]FDG-cyclo(RGD(D)YK) in 27.5% and 41% radiochemical yields (decay corrected) respectively. The receptor binding affinity study of FDGcyclo(RG(D)YK) for integrin alpha(v)beta(3) using alpha(v)beta(3) Positive U87MG cells confirmed a competitive displacement with 121 I-echistatin as a radioligand. The IC50 value for FDG-cyclo(RG(D)YK) was determined to be 0.67 +/- 0.19 mu M. High-contrast small animal PET images with relatively moderate tumor uptake were observed for [F-18]FDG-RGD and [F-18]FDG-cyclo(RG(D)DYK) as PET probes in xenograft models expressing alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. In conclusion, we have successfully used [F-18]FDG as a prosthetic group to prepare 18F]FDG-RGD and [F-18]FDG-cyclic[RGD(D)YK] based on a simple one-step radiosynthesis. The one-step radiosynthesis methodology consists of chemoselective oxime formation between an aminooxy-functionalized peptide and [F-18]FDG. The results have implications for radiolabeling of other macromolecules and would lead to a very simple strategy for routine preclinical and clinical use.

The assay was developed using intact cells as a receptor source because membrane fractions derived from these cells failed to discern specific binding from a high level of nonspecific binding. The pharmacological binding profile of seven 5-HT6 agonists and antagonists Using intact CHC-Dukx/5-HT6 cells in the SPA format was similar to data obtained from a filtration binding assay using HeLa/5-HT6 membranes. K-i values and rank order of potencies obtained in the SPA format were consistent with published filtration data as follows: SB-271046 (K-i = 1.9 nM) > methiothepin (K-i = 6.2 nM) > mianserin (K-i = 74.3 nM) > 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeOT, K-i = 111 nM) > 5-HT (K-i = 150 nM) > ritanserin (K-i = 207 nM) > 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT, K-i = 704 nM). Additional evaluation with four antipsychotics demonstrated strong agreement with previous literature reports. A high specific binding signal and low assay variability, as determined by Z' = 0.81 +/- 0.017, make the SPA format amenable to automation and higher throughput: hence, this assay can be a viable alternative to the more labor-intensive filtration and centrifugation methods.

Recently, it has been recognized that clinically effective antipsychotic drugs are 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonists rather than neutral antagonists. In the present study, which is part of the clinical development of the novel, selective 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist ACP-103, we applied positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand [C-11]N-methylspiperone ([C-11]NMSP) to study the relationship between oral dose, plasma level, and uptake of ACP-103 in living human brain. The safety of drug administration was also assessed. Four healthy volunteers were examined by PET at baseline, and after the oral administration of various single doses of ACP-103. Two subjects each received 1, 5, and 20 mg doses, and two subjects each received 2, 10, and 100 mg doses, respectively. ACP-103 was well tolerated. Detectable receptor binding was observed at very low ACP-103 serum levels. Cortical [C-11]NMSP binding was found to be dose-dependent and fitted well to the law of mass action. A reduction in binding was detectable after an oral dose of ACP-103 as low as 1 mg, and reached near maximal displacement following the 10-20 mg dose. In conclusion, administration of ACP-103 to healthy volunteers was found to be safe and well tolerated, and single oral doses as low as 10 mg were found to fully saturate 5-HT2A receptors in human brain as determined by PET.

ATYPICAL BETA-ADRENOCEPTORS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE CELLS; GROWTH FACTOR-I; PROTEIN-KINASE; BROWN ADIPOCYTES; RAT-BRAIN; DEVELOPMENTAL-CHANGES; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; ENERGY-METABOLISM	Isoprenaline, acting at beta-adrenoceptors (ARs), enhances memory formation in single trial discriminated avoidance learning in day-old chicks by mechanisms involving alterations in glucose and glycogen metabolism. Earlier studies of memory consolidation in chicks indicated that beta(3)-ARs enhanced memory by increasing glucose uptake, whereas beta(2)-ARs enhance memory by increasing glycogenolysis. This study examines the ability of beta-ARs to increase glucose uptake in chick forebrain astrocytes. The beta-AR agonist isoprenaline increased glucose uptake in a concentration-dependent manner, as did insulin. Glucose uptake was increased by the beta(2)-AR agonist zinterol and the beta(3)-AR agonist CL316243, but not by the beta(1)-AR agonist RO363. In chick astrocytes, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction studies showed that beta(1)-, beta(2)-, and beta(3)-AR mRNA were present, whereas radioligand-binding studies showed the presence of only beta(2)- and beta(3)-ARs. beta-AR or insulin-mediated glucose uptake was inhibited by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase and protein kinase C inhibitors, suggesting a possible interaction between the beta-AR and insulin pathways. However beta(2)- and beta(3)-ARs increase glucose uptake by two different mechanisms: beta(2)-ARs via a Gs-cAMP-protein kinase A-dependent pathway, while beta(3)-ARs via interactions with Gi. These results indicate that activation of beta(2)- and beta(3)-ARs causes glucose uptake in chick astrocytes by distinct mechanisms, which may be relevant for memory enhancement.

The expression of the A2AAR and the D2R is differentially regulated by nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). In this report, we determined the role of NF-kappa B in regulation of these receptors by comparing mice deficient in the NF-kappa B p50 subunit (p50 KO) with genetically intact B6129PF2/J (F2) mice. Quantification of adenosine receptor (AR) subtypes in mouse striatum by real time PCR, immunocytochemistry and radioligand binding assays showed more A2AAR but less A I AR in p50 KO mice as compared with F2 mice. Striata from p50 KO mice also had less D2R mRNA and [H-3]-methylspiperone binding than did striata from F2 mice. G(alpha olf) and G(alpha s) proteins, which are transducers of A2AAR signals, were also present at a higher level in striata from the p50 KO versus F2 mice. In contrast, the G(alpha i1) protein, which transduces signals from the AIAR and D2R, was significantly reduced in striata from p50 KO mice. Behaviorally, p50 KO mice exhibited increased locomotor activity relative to that of F2 mice after caffeine ingestion. These data are consistent with a role for the NF-kappa B in the regulation of A1AR, A2AAR, D2R and possibly their coupling G proteins in the striatum. Dysregulation of these receptors in the striata of p50 KO mice might sensitize these animals to locomotor stimulatory action of caffeine. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Analytical methods suited for their multianalyte detection are thus necessary. In this perspective, receptor assays were developed. The research activities undertaken in this study describe the solubilisation of a recombinant human beta(2)-adrenergic receptor produced in the inner membrane of genetically modified Escherichia coli, using the detergent n-dodecyl-beta-D-maltoside. Its potential to detect the presence of beta-agonists or beta-blockers in biological samples was evaluated. The solubilised beta(2)-adrenergic receptor retained its binding affinity in a radio-receptor assay based on the competition for the binding to receptors between a ligand (beta-agonist or antagonist) and the radioligand [I-125]iodocyanopindolol. The IC50 values ranged from 5 +/- x 10(-8) M (clenbuterol) to 8 +/- 2 x 10(-6) M (isoxsuprine) for the beta-agonists tested and from 1.5 +/- 0.2 x 10(-10) M (carazolol) to 1.2 +/- 0.2 x 10(-5) M (metoprolol) for the beta-blockers tested. It was shown to have a lower limit of detection than a radio-receptor assay using the solubilised beta(2)-adrenoceptor expressed in a mammalian cell line. The solubilised recombinant human beta(2)-adrenoreceptor expressed in E. coli would be a useful tool to develop non radioactive multianalyte screening methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Regulatory attention has focused on the drafting of Safety Pharmacology guidelines through the ICH (International Conference on Harmonization) process, which resulted in approval by the ICH and acceptance by the three main regions (USA, Europe, and Japan) of the ICH S7A guideline. The guideline does not deal only with cardiovascular studies and does not provide guidance on QT investigations. This part has been deferred to a second guideline (ICH S7B). Nevertheless, pharmaceutical companies have implemented screening strategies aimed at selecting compounds that do not present QT liabilities. These strategies can differ according to the pharmaceutical class, while experimental models differ according to the stage of development of the compound. Several in vitro models are employed in discovery (radioligand binding, high-throughput patch clamp, efflux, and fluorescence assays). These models, coupled with in silico methods, allow companies to screen a high number of compounds. Other in vitro models, applied later in the R&D process (action potential duration, APD, in Purkinje fibers or papillary muscle and the isolated heart) are useful in better describing the activity of compounds on cardiac ion channels. The most robust and accepted in vivo test is represented by telemetry studies in conscious non-rodents.

Long-term wash-resistant effects of brief interaction of xanomeline at the M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptor	NEUROSCIENCE LETTERS			English	Article						xanomeline; wash-resistant binding; muscarinic receptors; allosteric modulation	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; ACTIVATION; BINDING; AGONIST; SELECTIVITY; PROTEIN; SITE; M1	Compared to other M, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M-1 mAChR) agonists, xanomeline demonstrates both reversible and persistent modes of binding to the receptor. In our study, we investigated the long-term consequences of brief incubation of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing M-1 mAChR (M-1-CHO) with low concentrations of xanomeline followed by washing off the free drug. Thus, M-1-CHO cells were exposed to 100 nM xanomeline for 1 h then washed extensively. Washed cells were either used immediately for binding assays or incubated for 23 h in the absence of free xanomeline. Only the latter treatment conditions resulted in marked attenuation of binding of the muscarinic radioligand [H-3]N-methylscopolamine ([H-3]NMS) to intact cells. Shortening the xanomeline pretreatment period to 1 min had the same trends as the 1 h pretreatment, implying that xanomeline binds instantly to the receptor to elicit long-term wash-resistant effects. Presence of atropine during the brief period of xanomeline pretreatment did not markedly modulate xanomeline's long-term effects, which suggests that persistent anchoring of the xanomeline molecule to the M-1 receptor takes place at a site distinct from the orthosteric binding domain. Our findings suggest the possibility of a time-dependent transition of the conformation of the muscarinic M, receptor-xanomeline complex between states that vary in their ability to bind [H-3]NMS. However, possible involvement of other mechanisms of long-term receptor regulation cannot be discounted. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Recently, we found that (+)-p-methylvesamicol ((+)-PMV) has low affinity for VAChT (K-i = 199 nM), but has moderate to hi It affinity for sigma receptors: K-i = 3.0 nM for sigma, and K-i = 40.7 nM for sigma(2), and that sigma(1)-selective SA4503 (K-i = 4.4 nM for sigma(1) and K-i = 242 nM for sigma(2)) has moderate affinity for VAChT (K-i = 50.2 nM). In the present study, we examined the potential of (+)-[C-11]PMV as a PET radioligand for mapping sigma, receptors as compared with [C-11]SA4503. In rat brain, similarregional distribution patterns of (+)-[C-11]PMVand [C-11]SA4503 were shown by tissue dissection and by ex vivo autoradiography. Blocking experiments using (+/-)-PMV, (-)-vesamicol, SA4503, haloperidol and (+/-)-pentazocine showed that the two tracers specifically bound to sigma, receptors, and that [C-11]SA4503 exhibited greater specific binding than (+)-[C-11]PMV. No sign of VAChT-specific binding by [C-11]SA4503 was observed in the striatum, which is rich in VAChT sites. In conclusion, (+)-[C-11]PMV specifically bound to sigma, receptors in the brain, but to a lesser extent than [C-11]SA4503, suggesting that (+)-[C-11]PMV is a less preferable PET ligand than [C-11]SA4503. On the other hand, the moderate affinity of [C-11]SA4503 for VAChT is negligible in vivo. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

[H-3]BWA868C yielded well-defined autoradiograms of DP-receptors in human eyes with up to 82% specific binding. High densities of DP-receptors were associated with the ciliary epithelium/process, iris, choroid, longitudinal and circular ciliary muscles, and retina. Low specific binding was observed in the lens and cornea. The DP-receptor agonists, BW245C (K-i = 4-8 nM), SQ27986 (K-i = 6-9 nM), ZK118182 (K-i = 12-33 nM), 3,4-dihydro-ZK118182 (AL-6556; K-i = 1.6-4.3 (mu M) and 3,4-dihydro-ZK118182 isopropyl ester (AL-6598; K-i = 2.9-9.7 mu M), exhibited varying affinities for human DP-receptors in the ciliary process, longitudinal and circular ciliary muscles, and iris, respectively. These human ocular tissue affinity values correlated well with nonocular tissue affinities and functional potencies of these prostaglandins in cultured cells (r = 0.93-0.99). In conclusion, these quantitative autoradiographic studies revealed a high density of DP-prostaglandin receptors in human ciliary muscles, ciliary process, and iris, indicating that this class of prostaglandin may lower IOP by uveoscleral pathway and also by inhibiting aqueous humor production. The pharmacological attributes of [H-3]BWA868C-labeled receptor sites studied using in situ quantitative autoradiography matched those previously documented for several other DP.-receptor-containing cells and tissues.

Methods: In 5 healthy volunteers, after PET measurement of the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with O-15-H2O, a 60-min PET scan with C-11-MPDX was performed. The distribution volume (DV) of C-11-MPDX was quantitatively evaluated by Logan's graphical analysis. Results: C-11-MPDX was taken up at a high level, reaching a peak at 2-2.5 min, followed by a rapid decrease. The unchanged form of C-11-MPDX in plasma was 75% at 60 min after injection. The DV of C-11-MPDX was large in the striaturn and thalamus, moderate in the cerebral cortices and pons, and small in the cerebellum. The distribution pattern of C-11-MPDX in the brain was coincident with that of adenosine A(1) receptors in vitro, reported previously, but discretely different from that of rCBF. Conclusion: C-11-MPDX PET has the potential for mapping adenosine A(1) receptors in the human brain.

Changes in the serotonergic activity were observed only in rats, which showed retrieval of conditioned passive avoidance response. No serotonergic changes were found immediately and one day after training. Also, there were no changes in trained rats without retrieval of conditioned passive avoidance response or rats with experimental amnesia. The pattern of the involvement of brain structures in the retrieval process was also revealed. [H-3]-serotonin binding was decreased in the amygdala, periaqueductal gray matter and striatum, whereas it did not change in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. At the same time, the serotonin content in these structures did not differ from that of intact rats. Deamination of serotonin by monoamine oxidase and active transport of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid from nerve terminals were increased in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray matter, whereas in the striatum serotonin catabolism was decreased. The obtained differences in serotonin catabolism suggest that the decrease in receptor binding of serotonin in these brain structures is provided by different synaptic processes: presynaptic changes in the striatum and postsynaptic receptor changes in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray matter. It is concluded that the decrease in the serotonergic activity in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray matter represents one of the mechanisms activating the emotiogenic system mediating the memory trace retrieval in inhibitory avoidance learning.

However, in contrast to acute biological activities such as vasoconstriction, little is known about Iona-term effects of ET-1. In this study we determined the effects of ET-1 on the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (AR) system. Incubation of smooth muscle cells with ET-1 for 72 hr led to increased beta(2)AR density as determined by radioligand binding. Experiments with inhibitors of protein and RNA synthesis as well as RTPCR revealed that beta(2)AR upregulation required de novo synthesis. In addition, protein kinase C but neither NO nor prostaglandin metabolism were involved in this effect. The enhanced expression of beta(2)AR was associated with an increased expression of its stimulatory G-protein and the receptor's ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase. To study chronic effects of ET-1 in vivo, rats were infused with ET-1 for 3 weeks. Similarly as in cultured cells, prolonged ET-1 exposure led to increased PAR expression in vivo. As a consequence, beta(2)AR-induced vasodilatation was increased in aortic rings from ET-1-treated animals. Our results therefore suggest that chronically elevated ET-1 levels in vitro and in vivo induce counterregulatory mechanisms by increasing betaARs that attenuate the vasoconstrictive effects of ET-1.

In free solution, the mixed-order rate constants, k'(a), of salbutamol increase as the solute concentration increases until an apparent asymptotic value is reached. This could be due to the saturation of enzymatic systems responsible for the secretion of the drug from the enterocyte to the luminal fluid, a process that could explain the poor absorption of salbutamol. In the presence of sodium azide, the ii, values increased about 1.5-fold, whereas in the presence of verapamil they increased two- to three-fold. These results indicate that salbutamol can act as a substrate of an intestinal secretory transport, which probably includes - at least in part - the enzyme P-glycoprotein, since verapamil has been shown to inhibit this enzyme by dose-dependent competition. This leads to a secretion-limited peroral absorption of salbutamol, which contributes to the poor oral bioavailability of the drug. The possible options for improving salbutamol absorption are discussed. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Its etiology remains unknown. We propose that SIDS, or a subset of SIDS, is due to a failure of autoresuscitation, a protective brainstem response to asphyxia or hypoxia, in a vulnerable infant during a critical developmental period. Gasping is an important component of autoresuscitation that is thought to be mediated by the "gasping center" in the lateral tegmentum of the medulla, a region homologous in its cytoarchitecture and chemical anatomy to the intermediate reticular zone (IRZ) in the human. Since we found that [H-3]para-aminoclonidine ([H-3]PAC) binding to alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors localizes to this region in human infants and, thereby provides a neurochemical marker for it, we tested the hypothesis that [H-3]PAC binding to alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors is decreased in the IRZ in SIDS victims. Using quantitative tissue autoradiography with [H-3]PAC as the radioligand and phentolamine as the displacer, we analyzed alph(2)-receptor binding density in the IRZ, as well as in 7 additional sites for comparison, in 10 SIDS and 10 control medullae. There were no significant differences in alpha, receptor binding in the IRZ, vagal nuclei, or other medullary sites examined between SIDS and control cases. These results suggest that the putative gasping defect in the IRZ in SIDS victims is not related to [H-3]PAC binding to alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors.

BACKGROUND Recently, we reported on the existence of activating anti-beta(1)-AR antibodies in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM 26% prevalence) or ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM, 10% prevalence); however, their functional effects have not yet been thoroughly characterized. METHODS In this study we detected functionally active receptor-antibodies in 8 out of 30 DCM patients. Their immunological and functional properties were analyzed using both synthetic receptor-peptides and intact recombinant human beta(1)-AR, and were compared with those of heterologous antibodies to selected beta(1)-AR domains generated in rabbits and mice. RESULTS Rabbit, mouse, and human anti-beta(1)-AR against the second extracellular domain preferentially bound to a native receptor conformation and impaired radioligand binding to the receptor. However, their functional effects differed considerably: Rabbit and mouse antibodies decreased both basal and agonist-stimulated cAMP production, whereas the patient antibodies (n = 8) increased basal, and six of them also increased agonist-stimulated receptor activity (i.e., acted as receptor-sensitizing agents). Two out of eight human anti-beta(1)-AR increased basal but decreased agonist-stimulated receptor activity (i.e., acted as partial agonists). CONCLUSIONS Antibodies against the same small beta(1)-AR domain can have very divergent allosteric effects, ranging from inhibitory to agonist-promoting activities. Activating autoantibodies were associated with severe cardiac dysfunction and thus might be involved in the development and/or course of human cardiomyopathy.

We have examined their effect at mu-opioid receptors regulating neurogenic contractions of several smooth muscle preparations and also against spontaneous contractions of the rat isolated portal vein. 2 Ibogaine (pIC(50) 5.28) and 18-methoxycoronaridine (pIC(50) 5.05) caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of cholinergic contractions of the guinea-pig ileum which was not affected by the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mu M). 3 In the rat isolated vas deferens ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine caused a concentration-dependent enhancement of purinergic contractions. Both agents (30 mu M) caused a 3-5 fold rightward displacement of DAMGO-induced inhibition of purinergic contractions, but similar effects were observed for ibogaine against alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of neurogenic responses. 4 In the guinea-pig isolated bladder both ibogaine (10 mu M) and 18-methoxycoronaridine (10 mu M) caused a 2 fold increase in the purinergic component of neurogenic contractions without significantly altering cholinergic contractions or responses to exogenous ATP. In contrast, ibogaine (1-30 mu M), but not 18-methoxycoronaridine, caused a concentration-dependent enhancement of spontaneous contractions of the rat isolated portal vein. 5 In summary, while ibogaine and 18-methoxycoronaridine modulated electrically-evoked contractions in the three preparations examined, we have no evidence for a selective interaction with pre-junctional mu-opioid receptors. The pronounced enhancement of purinergic contractions produced by both agents is a novel finding and worthy of further investigation.

Aim of the study: To investigate the in vitro cannabinoid and opioid receptor binding affinities, and in vivo behavioral actions of Nelumbo flower extracts and to isolate the potential compounds to treat CNS associated disorders. Materials and methods: The white and pink flowers of N. nucifera were extracted with 95% EtOH, followed by acid base partitioning using CHCl3 to give acidic and basic partitions. These partitions were subjected to Centrifugal Preparative TLC (CPTLC) to yield benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline (BTIQ) alkaloids and long chain fatty acids, identified by physical and spectroscopic methods. In addition, EtOH extracts and partitions were analyzed for chemical markers by UHPLC/MS and GC/MS. In vitro neuropharmacological effects were evaluated by cannabinoid (CB1 and CB2) and opioid [delta (delta), kappa (kappa), and mu (mu)] competitive radioligand binding and GTP gamma S functional assays. The in vivo behavioral effect was studied through the use of the mouse tetrad assay at 10, 30, 75 and 100 mg/kg/ip doses that revealed the effect on locomotion, catalepsy, body temperature, and nociception of acidic and basic CHCl3 partitions, fractions, and compounds. Results: Three aporphines, nuciferine (1), N-nor-nuciferine (2), asimilobine (3), and five BTIQs, armepavine (4), O-methylcoclaurine (5), N-methylcoclaurine (6), coclaurine (7), neferine (10), and a mixture of linoleic and palmitic acids (LA and PA), were identified and evaluated for cannabinoid and opioid receptor displacement activities. Compounds 5-7 showed binding affinities for the kappa opioid receptor with equilibrium dissociation constant (K-i) values of 3.5 +/- 0.3, 0.9 +/- 0.1, 2.2 +/- 0.2 mu M, respectively. Compound 10 displayed affinities for delta-and mu- opioid receptors with K-i values of 0.7 +/- 0.1 and 1.8 +/- 0.2 mu M, respectively, and was determined to be a weak delta agonist by GTP gamma S functional assay. The mixture of LA and PA (1:1) showed an affinity for delta opioid receptor with a K-i value of 9.2 +/- 1.1 mu M. The acidic and basic CHCl3 partitions, compounds 1 and 7, and 5-7 mixture were subjected to the tetrad assay, of which the acidic partition displayed decreased locomotion and increased catalepsy, antinociception, and hypothermia in animal at doses of 75-100 mg/kg/ip, and also showed clonic-tonic seizures upon touch at 100 mg/kg. Conclusion: Bioassay-guided isolation revealed compounds 5-7, 10, and the mixture of LA and PA displayed various degrees of opioid receptor radioligand displacement affinities. The in vivo tetrad assay of acidic CHCl3 partition, enriched with aporphines 1 and 2, displayed actions on all four points of behavioral parameters. It can be concluded that the in vivo mild canabimimetic-type effect observed for the CHCl3 partition is likely mediated through other CNS mechanisms since the extracts, partitions, and isolated compounds had no affinity for the in vitro CB1 and CB2 receptors. This work, along with traditional use and the reported bioactivities of the BTIQ alkaloids, suggested further studies on N. nuafera are needed to understand the roles that the extracts and/or individual compounds might contribute to the behavioral effects.

Evaluation of chemical constituents of Rooibos (<i>Aspalathus linearis</i>) and Honeybush (<i>Cyclopia intermedia</i>) as adenosine A<sub>1</sub>/A<sub>2A</sub> receptor ligands	MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Rooibos; Honeybush; Adenosine A(1) receptor; Adenosine A(2A) receptor; Structure-activity relationships	AFRICAN HERBAL TEAS; DRUG DISCOVERY; QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERIZATION; INTERNATIONAL UNION; SCREENING LIBRARIES; A(2A) RECEPTORS; RAT-BRAIN; A(1); ANTAGONISTS; CLASSIFICATION	Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and Honeybush (Cyclopia intermedia) are popular tisanes in South Africa and are of growing interest due to the wide variety of flavonoids and other phytochemicals they contain. Despite their history as herbal teas and traditional medicines, the chemical constituents of these tisanes have yet to be studied for their effects on adenosine receptors. A series of 30 commercially available chemical constituents of Rooibos and Honeybush were investigated via radioligand binding studies to determine their adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor affinity at both rat and human subtypes in order to establish structure-activity relationships and identify novel adenosine receptor ligands. In addition, in silico evaluations of the 30 test compounds were also performed to predict their physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties. The most promising chemical constituent was kaempferol (28) which showed sub-micromolar affinity towards the rat A(1) subtype (rA(1)K(i) = 0.7287 mu M; hA(1)K(i) = 9.88 mu M) and acted as an antagonist toward adenosine rA(1) receptors. Additionally, quercetin (2), chrysoeriol (8), luteolin (9), eriodyctiol (12), and naringenin (27) also showed adenosine A(1) and/or A(2A) receptor affinity. It was observed that a flavonol scaffold is preferred to flavone and flavanone scaffolds, and within the flavonols, C4'-OH substitution on ring B is preferred to C3',4'-diOH substitution. These phytochemicals, specifically kaempferol (28), may be considered lead-like and valuable in designing novel ligands, based on in vitro and in silico evaluation. [GRAPHICS] .

Novel Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) Low Lipophilicity Agonists Produce Distinct cAMP and Arrestin Signalling Kinetics without Bias	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						receptor; cannabinoid; CB2; cannabinoid receptor agonists; signal transduction; cyclic AMP; beta-arrestin 2; kinetics; drug development; chemistry; pharmaceutical	DERIVATIVES; MECHANISM; DISCOVERY; S-777469	Cannabinoid Receptor 2 (CB2) is a promising target for treating inflammatory diseases. We designed derivatives of 3-carbamoyl-2-pyridone and 1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one-3-carboxamide CB2-selective agonists with reduced lipophilicity. The new compounds were measured for their affinity (radioligand binding) and ability to elicit cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling and b-arrestin-2 translocation with temporal resolution (BRET-based biosensors). For the 3-carbamoyl-2-pyridone derivatives, we found that modifying the previously reported compound UOSS77 (also known as S-777469) by appending a PEG2-alcohol via a 3-carbomylcyclohexyl carboxamide (UOSS75) lowered lipophilicity, and preserved binding affinity and signalling profile. The 1,8-naphthyridin-2(1H)-one-3-carboxamide UOMM18, containing a cis configuration at the 3-carboxamide cyclohexyl and with an alcohol on the 4-position of the cyclohexyl, had lower lipophilicity but similar CB2 affinity and biological activity to previously reported compounds of this class. Relative to CP55,940, the new compounds acted as partial agonists and did not exhibit signalling bias. Interestingly, while all compounds shared similar temporal trajectories for maximal efficacy, differing temporal trajectories for potency were observed. Consequently, when applied at sub-maximal concentrations, CP55,940 tended to elicit sustained (cAMP) or increasing (arrestin) responses, whereas responses to the new compounds tended to be transient (cAMP) or sustained (arrestin). In future studies, the compounds characterised here may be useful in elucidating the consequences of differential temporal signalling profiles on CB2-mediated physiological responses.

The pure enantiomers of unlabeled compounds (S)- and (R)-1 and the corresponding iodonium ylide precursors were synthesized and characterized. The two enantiomers (S)1 and (R)-1 exhibited comparable high affinity for sigma(1) receptors and selectivity over a 2 receptors. The Ca2+ fluorescence assay indicated that (R)-1 behaved as an antagonist and (S)-1 as an agonist for sigma(1) receptors. The F-18-labeled enantiomers (S)- and (R)-[F-18]1 were obtained in >99% enantiomeric purity from the corresponding enantiopure iodonium ylide precursors with radiochemical yield of 24.4% +/- 2.6% and molar activity of 86-214 GBq/mu mol. In ICR mice both (S)- and (R)-[F-18]1 displayed comparable high brain uptake, brain-to-blood ratio, in vivo stability and binding specificity in the brain and peripheral organs. In micro-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rats, (S)-[F-18]1 exhibited faster clearance from the brain than (R)-[F-18]1, indicating different brain kinetics of the two enantiomers. Both (S)- and (R)-[F-18]1 warrant further evaluation in primates to translate a single enantiomer with more suitable kinetics for imaging the sigma(1) receptors in humans.

The serotonin 1B (5-HT1B) receptor is a potential target for treatment of depression and low 5-HT1B receptor binding in limbic regions has been reported in previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies of depression. Methods: The objective of this longitudinal PET study was to examine the effect of ECT for depression on 5-HT1B receptor binding. Fifteen hospitalized patients with major depressive episodes were examined with PET and the 5-HT1B receptor selective radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369, before and after ECT. Fifteen controls matched for age and sex were examined. Limbic regions with previously reported low 5-HT1B receptor binding in depression and a dorsal brain stem region were selected. Results: Thirteen patients completed the study according to protocol. Eleven out of thirteen patients responded to ECT. 5-HT1B receptor binding in hippocampus increased with 30 % after ECT (p=0.021). Using linear mixed effects modelling, we observed increases in 5-HT1B receptor binding following ECT with a moderate to large effect size, which did not differ significantly between regions. In an exploratory analysis, strong correlations between changes in 5-HT1B receptor binding and agitation scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale after ECT were observed. Limitations: Albeit representative of a PET study, the sample size is still small and there are potential confounding effects of medication. Conclusions: Increased 5-HT1B receptor binding was observed following ECT for depression, corresponding to previous findings of increased 5-HT1B receptor binding in hippocampus after rapid acting ketamine for treatment resistant depression.

Targeting the K<sub>v</sub>11.1 (hERG) channel with allosteric modulators. Synthesis and biological evaluation of three novel series of LUF7346 derivatives	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						K(v)11.1 (hERG) channel; Allosteric modulation; LUF7346; Cardiotoxicity; Dofetilide; Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes		We synthesized and evaluated three novel series of substituted benzophenones for their allosteric modulation of the human K(v)11.1 (hERG) channel. We compared their effects with reference compound LUF7346 previously shown to shorten the action potential of cardiomyocytes derived from human stem cells. Most compounds behaved as negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) of [H-3]dofetilide binding to the channel. Compound 9i was the most potent amongst all ligands, remarkably reducing the affinity of dofetilide in competitive displacement assays. One of the other derivatives (6k) tested in a second radioligand binding set-up, displayed unusual displacement characteristics with a pseudo-Hill coefficient significantly distinct from unity, further indicative of its allosteric effects on the channel. Some compounds were evaluated in a more physiologically relevant context in beating cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. Surprisingly, the compounds tested showed effects quite different from the reference NAM LUF7346. For instance, compound 5e prolonged, rather than shortened, the field potential duration, while it did not influence this parameter when the field potential was already prolonged by dofetilide. In subsequent patch clamp studies on HEK293 cells expressing the hERG channel the compounds behaved as channel blockers. In conclusion, we successfully synthesized and identified new allosteric modulators of the hERG channel. Unexpectedly, their effects differed from the reference compound in functional assays on hERG-HEK293 cells and human cardiomyocytes, to the extent that the compounds behaved as stand-alone channel blockers.

To enhance brain distribution, amyloid-beta (A beta) antibodies were fused to a transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody fragment, enabling receptor mediated transport across the BBB. The aim of this study was to label these bispecific antibodies with fluorine-18 and use them for A beta PET imaging. Bispecific antibody ligands RmAb158-scFv8D3 and Tribody A2, both targeting A beta and Tilt, were functionalized with transcyclooctene (TCO) groups and conjugated with 18 F-labeled tetrazines through an inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction performed at ambient temperature. F-18-labeling did not affect antibody binding in vitro, and initial brain uptake was high. Conjugates with the first tetrazine variant ([F-18]T1) displayed high uptake in bone, indicating extensive defluorination, a problem that was resolved with the second and third tetrazine variants ([F-18]T2 and [F-18]T3). Although the antibody ligands' half-life in blood was too long to optimally match the physical half-life of fluorine-18 (t(1/2), = 110 min), [F-18]T3-Tribody A2 PET seemed to discriminate transgenic mice (tg-ArcSwe) with A beta deposits from wild-type mice 12 h after injection. This study demonstrates that F-18-labeling of bispecific, brain penetrating antibodies is feasible and, with further optimization, could be used for CNS PET imaging.

It is suggested that the sigma-1 receptor (sigma 1R) confers anti-inflammatory effects. As the exact pathogenesis of IBD is still unknown and treatment options are limited, we aimed to investigate the effects of sigma 1R in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced experimental colitis. To this end, male Wistar-Harlan rats were used to model colitic inflammation through the administration of TNBS. To investigate the effects of sigma 1R, Fluvoxamine (FLV, sigma 1R agonist) and BD1063 (sigma 1R antagonist) were applied via intracolonic administration to the animals once a day for three days. Our radioligand binding studies indicated the existence of sigma 1Rs as [H-3](+)-pentazocine binding sites, and FLV treatment increased the reduced sigma 1R maximum binding capacity in TNBS-induced colitis. Furthermore, FLV significantly attenuated the colonic damage, the effect of which was abolished by the administration of BD1063. Additionally, FLV potentially increased the expression of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase ligase-1 (UCHL-1) and the levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and decreased the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and inducible NOS (iNOS) expression. In summary, our study offers evidence for the anti-inflammatory potential of FLV and sigma 1R in experimental colitis, and our results present a promising approach to the development of new sigma 1R-targeted treatment options against IBD.

It was found that CPG at doses of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day reduces the density of 5-HT2A receptors in the striatum of mice by 24 and 28%, respectively. A decrease in the density of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus was observed only at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day; it was 22%. At the same time, there was an increase in the density of GABA(A) receptors in the frontal cortex at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day by 36% compared with the control. The 2-week administration of CPG at both doses did not affect B-max of mGluII- and GABA(B) receptors, as well as K-d in all groups. In the in vitro radioligand assay, the CPG did not affect the specific binding of the labeled ligands of the studied receptors. These data indicate the functional involvement of 5-HT2A, NMDA, and GABA(A) receptors in the formation of the antidepressant-like effect of cycloprolylglycine in BALB/c mice for the first time.

Comprehensive molecular pharmacology screening reveals potential new receptor interactions for clinically relevant opioids	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MORPHINE ANALGESIA; SIGMA-1 RECEPTORS; BIASED LIGAND; MICE LACKING; IN-VIVO; TOLERANCE; PROTEIN; DISCOVERY; EFFICACY; PAIN	Most clinically used opioids are thought to induce analgesia through activation of the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, disparities have been observed between the efficacy of opioids in activating the MOR in vitro and in inducing analgesia in vivo. In addition, some clinically used opioids do not produce cross-tolerance with each other, and desensitization produced in vitro does not match tolerance produced in vivo. These disparities suggest that some opioids could be acting through other targets in vivo, but this has not been comprehensively tested. We thus screened 9 clinically relevant opioids (buprenorphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, morphine, 0-desmethyl-tramadol, oxycodone, oxymorphone, tapentadol, tramadol) against 9 pain-related receptor targets (MOR, delta opioid receptor [DOR], kappa opioid receptor [KOR], nociceptin receptor [NOP], cannabinoid receptor type 1 [CB1], sigma-1 receptor [al R], and the monoamine transporters [NET/SERT/DAT]) expressed in cells using radioligand binding and functional activity assays. We found several novel interactions, including monoamine transporter activation by buprenorphine and al R binding by hydrocodone and tapentadol. Tail flick anti-nociception experiments with CD-1 mice demonstrated that the monoamine transporter inhibitor duloxetine selectively promoted buprenorphine anti-nociception while producing no effects by itself or in combination with the most MOR-selective drug oxymorphone, providing evidence that these novel interactions could be relevant in vivo. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the receptor interaction profiles of clinically relevant opioids, which has not previously been performed. Our findings also suggest novel receptor interactions for future investigation that could explain some of the disparities observed between opioid performance in vitro and in vivo.

Although ciguatera constitutes the primary cause of seafood intoxication in Cuba, very little information is available on the occurrence of ciguatoxins in the marine food web and the causative benthic dinoflagellate species. This study conducted on the south-central coast of Cuba reports the occurrence of Gambierdiscus and Fukuyoa genera and the associated benthic genera Ostreopsis and Prorocentrum. Gambierdiscus/Fukuyoa cells were present at low to moderate abundances depending on the site and month of sampling. This genus was notably higher on Dictyotaceae than on other macrophytes. PCR analysis of field-collected samples revealed the presence of six different Gambierdiscus and one Fukuyoa species, including G. caribaeus, G. carolinianus, G. carpenteri, G. belizeanus, F. ruetzleri, G. silvae, and Gambierdiscus sp. ribotype 2. Only Gambierdiscus excentricus was absent from the eight Gambierdiscus/Fukuyoa species known in the wider Caribbean region. Eleven clonal cultures were established and confirmed by PCR and SEM as being either G. carolinianus or G. caribaeus. Toxin production in each isolate was assessed by a radioligand receptor binding assay and found to be below the assay quantification limit. These novel findings augment the knowledge of the ciguatoxin-source dinoflagellates that are present in Cuba, however further studies are needed to better understand the correlation between their abundance, species-specific toxin production in the environment, and the risk for fish contamination, in order to develop better informed ciguatera risk management strategies.

Bicyclic Peptides as a New Modality for Imaging and Targeting of Proteins Overexpressed by Tumors	CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							MATRIX-METALLOPROTEINASE; 1-MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASE; MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; EXPRESSION; PET; F-18-AH111585; RADIOLIGAND; STABILITY; PROGNOSIS; AFFINITY	Molecular imaging of cancers using probes specific for tumor-associated target proteins offers a powerful solution for providing information regarding selection of targeted therapy, patient stratification, and response to therapy. Here we demonstrate the power of bicyclic peptides as targeting probes, exemplified with the tumor-overexpressed matrix metalloproteinase MT1-MMP as a target. A bicyclic peptide with subnanomolar affinity towards MT1-MMP was identified, and its radioconjugate showed selective tumor uptake in an HT1080 xenograft mouse model. Proteolytic stabilization of the peptide by chemical modification significantly enhanced the in vivo tumor signal [from 2.5% ID/g to 12% ID/g at 1 hour post injection (p. i.)]. Studies using mouse xenograft models with different cell lines show a robust correlation between tumor signals and in vivo MT1MMP expression levels. Fatty acid modification of the bicy-clic peptide extended its circulating half-life, resulting in increased tumor signals (36% ID/g at 6 hours p. i.). Comparative work with an equipotent radiolabeled MT1-MMP targeting antibody demonstrated starkly differential biodistribution and tumor accumulation properties, with the tumor signal slowly increasing to 6.2% ID/g within 48 hours. The rapid tumor penetration characteristics of bicyclic peptides, coupled with high potency and chemical versatility, thus offer high-contrast imaging probes for clinical diagnostics with compelling additional potential in targeted therapy. Significance: This work demonstrates the potential of bicyclic peptides as a platform for the development of highcontrast imaging probes for potential use in clinical cancer diagnostics and molecularly targeted therapeutics.

However, the precise mechanisms responsible for the bladder-selective pharmacological effects of this agent remain unclear. The in vivo pharmacologic effects of imidafenacin result from receptor occupancy. Therefore, the present study was performed to characterize in vivo muscarinic receptor binding by tritium-labeled imidafenacin with high specific activity ([H-3]imidafenacin) in the bladder and other tissues of mice, and to clarify the mechanisms underlying selective binding of imidafenacin to bladder muscarinic receptors. After intravenous injection of [H-3] imidafenacin, its binding to muscarinic receptors in the bladder and other tissues of mice was assessed by a radioligand binding assay. [H-3] Imidafenacin showed a significantly longer duration of binding to muscarinic receptors in the bladder than in other tissues, and muscarinic receptor binding of [H-3] imidafenacin was markedly suppressed in the bladder alone after bilateral ligation of the ureters. After intravenous injection, the [H-3] imidafenacin concentration was markedly higher in the urine than in the plasma, suggesting that urinary excretion may contribute significantly to the selective and long-lasting binding of imidafenacin to bladder muscarinic receptors. These findings suggest that the intra-vesicular concentration of an antimuscarinic agent and its active metabolites may have a substantial influence on its pharmacological effect and duration of action in patients with OAB. In addition, factors that modulate urine production may influence the efficacy and safety of antimuscarinic agents.

In this work, a new lactam bridge alpha-MSH analog was labeled with Tc-99m via HYNIC and EDDA/tricine as coligands including gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a three carbon chain spacer between HYNIC and the N-terminus of the cyclic peptide. Also, stability in human serum, receptor bound internalization, in vivo tumor uptake, and tissue biodistribution were thoroughly investigated. HYNIC-GABA-Nle-CycMSH(hept) was synthesized using a standard Fmoc strategy. Labeling was performed at 95 A degrees C and analysis involved instant thin layer chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography methods. The receptor bound internalization rate was studied in MC1 receptor expressing B16/F10 cells. Biodistribution of radiopeptide was studied in nude mice bearing B16/F10 tumor. Labeling yield of > 98 % (n = 3) was obtained corresponding to a specific activity of 81 MBq/nmol. Peptide conjugate showed efficient stability in the presence of human serum. The radioligand showed specific internalization into B16/F10 cells (12.45 +/- A 1.1 % at 4 h). In biodistribution studies, a receptor-specific uptake was observed in MC1 receptor-positive organs so that after 2 h the uptake in mouse tumor was 5.10 +/- A 0.08 % ID/g, while low accumulation in the kidney uptake was observed (4.58 +/- A 0.68 % ID/g at 2 h after injection). The obtained results show that the presented new designed labeled peptide conjugate may be a suitable candidate for diagnosis of malignant tumors.

Individual Differences in Impulsive Action Reflect Variation in the Cortical Serotonin 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> Receptor System	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							REACTION-TIME-TASK; HEAD-TWITCH RESPONSE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; DOPAMINERGIC MECHANISMS; RAT-BRAIN; ADULT-RAT; BEHAVIOR; AGONIST; PERFORMANCE	Impulsivity is an important feature of multiple neuropsychiatric disorders, and individual variation in the degree of inherent impulsivity could play a role in the generation or exacerbation of problematic behaviors. Serotonin (5-HT) actions at the 5-HT2AR receptor (5-HT2AR) promote and 5-HT2AR antagonists suppress impulsive action (the inability to withhold premature responses; motor impulsivity) upon systemic administration or microinfusion directly into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), a node in the corticostriatal circuit that is thought to play a role in the regulation of impulsive action. We hypothesized that the functional capacity of the 5-HT2AR, which is governed by its expression, localization, and protein/protein interactions (eg, postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95)), may drive the predisposition to inherent impulsive action. Stable high-impulsive (HI) and low-impulsive (LI) phenotypes were identified from an outbred rodent population with the 1-choice serial reaction time (1-CSRT) task. HI rats exhibited a greater head-twitch response following administration of the preferential 5-HT2AR agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and were more sensitive to the effects of the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist M100907 to suppress impulsive action relative to LI rats. A positive correlation was observed between levels of premature responses and 5-HT2AR binding density in frontal cortex ([H-3]-ketanserin radioligand binding). Elevated mPFC 5-HT2AR protein expression concomitant with augmented association of the 5-HT2AR with PSD95 differentiated HI from LI rats. The observed differential sensitivity of HI and LI rats to 5-HT2AR ligands and associated distinct 5-HT2AR protein profiles provide evidence that spontaneously occurring individual differences in impulsive action reflect variation in the cortical 5-HT2AR system.

This study aimed to demonstrate that the B2R antagonist, fasitibant, inhibits the BK pro-angiogenic effects. Methodology: We assesed the ability of fasibitant to antagonize the BK stimulation of cultured human cells (HUVEC) and circulating pro-angiogenic cells (PACs), in producing cell permeability (paracellular flux), migration and pseocapillary formation. The latter parameter was studied in vitro (matrigel assay) and in vivo in mice (matrigel plug) and in rat model of experimental osteoarthritis (OA). We also evaluated NF-kappa B activation in cultured cells by measuring its nuclear translocation and its downstream effectors such as the proangiogenic ciclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Principal findings: HUVEC, exposed to BK (1-10 mu M), showed increased permeability, disassembly of adherens and tight-junction, increased cell migration, and pseudocapillaries formation. We observed a significant increase of vessel density in the matrigel assay in mice and in rats OA model. Importantly, B2R stimulation elicited, both in HUVEC and PACs, NF-kappa B activation, leading to COX-2 overexpression, enhanced prostaglandin E-2 production. and VEGF output. The BK/NF-kappa B axis, and the ensuing amplification of inflammatory/angiogenic responses were fully prevented by fasitibant as well as by IKK VII, an NF-kappa B. Inhibitor. Conclusion: This work illustrates the role of the endothelium in the inflammation provoked by the BK/NF-kappa B axis. It also demonstates that B2R blockade by the antaogonist fasibitant, abolishes both the initial stimulus and its amplification, strongly attenuating the propagation of inflammation.

These ligands are well characterized in pharmacological assays, including radioligand competition binding studies, GTPS and GTPase assays. In most cases, these experiments are performed in transfected cell lines, expressing unnaturally high levels of target receptors and G-protein signalling components. In this study we investigated the specific properties of H-4 receptor ligands in native cells. Experimental Approach Histamine and five different H-4 receptor agonists - 4-methylhistamine, UR-PI376, clobenpropit, VUF8430 and ST-1006 - were characterized in freshly isolated human monocytes. The ligands (10nM-10M) were tested as inhibitors of IL-12p70 secretion from human monocytes and the effects of the H-2 receptor antagonist ranitidine and the H-4 receptor antagonist JNJ7777120 on their action was investigated. Key Results Histamine and all the tested agonists reduced IL-12p70 secretion into monocyte supernatants by 40-70%. The potencies varied with pEC(50) values ranging from 5.7 to 6.9, depending on the agonist used. All potencies were lower than those determined in the original investigations of the compounds. Pretreatment of monocytes with H-2 or H-4 receptor antagonists showed that some H-4 receptor ligands also had low activity at the H-2 receptor. Conclusions and Implications Our study demonstrates discrepancies between the potencies obtained from assays in transfected cell lines and assays in native human cells, indicating the importance of evaluating H-4 receptor ligands in native cells.

Functional genomics of the rat neuromedin U receptor 1 reveals a naturally occurring deleterious allele. Physiol Genomics 45: 89-97, 2013. First published December 4, 2012; doi: 10.1152/physiolgenomics.00070.2012.-Neuromedin U (NMU) plays an important role in a number of physiological processes, but the relative contribution of its two known receptors, NMUR1 and NMUR2, is still poorly understood. Here we report the existence of a SNP T-1022 -> A (Val(341)-> G) in the third exon of the rat Nmur1 gene that leads to an inactive receptor. This SNP is present within the coding region of the highly conserved NPXXY motif found within all class A type G protein-coupled receptors and translates to an NMUR1 receptor that is not expressed on the cell surface. Genetic analysis of the Nmur1 gene in a population of Sprague-Dawley rats revealed that this strain is highly heterogeneous for the inactivating polymorphism. The loss of functional NMUR1 receptors in Sprague-Dawley rats homozygous for the inactive allele was confirmed by radioligand binding studies on native tissue expressing NMUR1. The physiological relevance of this functional genomics finding was examined in two nociceptive response models. The pronociceptive effects of NMU were abolished in rats lacking functional NMUR1 receptors. The existence of naturally occurring NMUR1-deficient rats provides a novel and powerful tool to investigate the physiological role of NMU and its receptors. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of verifying the NMUR1 single nucleotide polymorphism status for rats used in physiological, pharmacological or toxicological studies conducted with NMUR1 modulators.

Jeffrey			Investigating Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 Allosteric Modulator Cooperativity, Affinity, and Agonism: Enriching Structure-Function Studies and Structure-Activity Relationships	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							RAT BEHAVIORAL-MODELS; IN-VIVO ACTIVITY; MGLU5 RECEPTOR; HIGHLY POTENT; NONCOMPETITIVE ANTAGONISTS; SUBTYPE-5 ANTAGONISTS; ANXIOLYTIC ACTIVITY; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE; BINDING POCKETS; DRUG DISCOVERY	Drug discovery programs increasingly are focusing on allosteric modulators as a means to modify the activity of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) targets. Allosteric binding sites are topographically distinct from the endogenous ligand (orthosteric) binding site, which allows for co-occupation of a single receptor with the endogenous ligand and an allosteric modulator that can alter receptor pharmacological characteristics. Negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) inhibit and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) enhance the affinity and/or efficacy of orthosteric agonists. Established approaches for estimation of affinity and efficacy values for orthosteric ligands are not appropriate for allosteric modulators, and this presents challenges for fully understanding the actions of novel modulators of GPCRs. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu(5)) is a family C GPCR for which a large array of allosteric modulators have been identified. We took advantage of the many tools for probing allosteric sites on mGlu(5) to validate an operational model of allosterism that allows quantitative estimation of modulator affinity and cooperativity values. Affinity estimates derived from functional assays fit well with affinities measured in radioligand binding experiments for both PAMs and NAMs with diverse chemical scaffolds and varying degrees of cooperativity. We observed modulation bias for PAMs when we compared mGlu(5)-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation data. Furthermore, we used this model to quantify the effects of mutations that reduce binding or potentiation by PAMs. This model can be applied to PAM and NAM potency curves in combination with maximal fold-shift data to derive reliable estimates of modulator affinities.

PET Imaging a MPTP-Induced Mouse Model of Parkinson's Disease Using the Fluoropropyl-Dihydrotetrabenazine Analog [<SUP>18</SUP>F]-DTBZ (AV-133)	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VESICULAR MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BETA-CELL MASS; IN-VIVO; DOPAMINE DEPLETION; ANIMAL-MODELS; 1-METHYL-4-PHENYL-1,2,3,6-TETRAHYDROPYRIDINE MPTP; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; MICE; F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ	Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the nigrostriatal system. Numerous researchers in the past have attempted to track the progression of dopaminergic depletion in PD. We applied a quantitative non-invasive PET imaging technique to follow this degeneration process in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. The VMAT2 ligand F-18-DTBZ (AV-133) was used as a radioactive tracer in our imaging experiments to monitor the changes of the dopaminergic system. Intraperitoneal administrations of MPTP (a neurotoxin) were delivered to mice at regular intervals to induce lesions consistent with PD. Our results indicate a significant decline in the levels of striatal dopamine and its metabolites (DOPAC and HVA) following MPTP treatment as determined by HPLC method. Images obtained by positron emission tomography revealed uptake of F-18-DTBZ analog in the mouse striatum. However, reduction in radioligand binding was evident in the striatum of MPTP lesioned animals as compared with the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis further confirmed PET imaging results and indicated the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in treated animals compared with the control counterparts. In conclusion, our findings suggest that MPTP induced PD in mouse model is appropriate to follow the degeneration of dopaminergic system and that F-18-DTBZ analog is a potentially sensitive radiotracer that can used to diagnose changes associated with PD by PET imaging modality.

In this study, we describe the generation of a panel of 38 nanobodies, small HER2-binding fragments that are derived from heavy-chain-only antibodies raised in an immunized dromedary. In search of a lead compound, a subset of nanobodies was biochemically characterized in depth and preclinically tested for use as tracers for imaging of xenografted tumors. The selected compound, 2Rs15d, was found to be stable and to interact specifically with HER2 recombinant protein and HER2-expressing cells in ELISA, surface plasmon resonance, flow cytometry, and radioligand binding studies with low nanomolar affinities, and did not compete with anti-HER2 therapeutic antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. Single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging quantification and biodistribution analyses showed that Tc-99m-labeled 2Rs15d has a high tumor uptake in 2 HER2(+) tumor models, fast blood clearance, low accumulation in nontarget organs except kidneys, and high concomitant tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios at 1 h after intravenous injection. These values were dramatically lower for an irrelevant control Tc-99m-nanobody and for Tc-99m-2Rs15d targeting a HER2(-) tumor.-Vaneycken, I., Devoogdt, N., Van Gassen, N., Vincke, C., Xavier, C., Wernery, U., Muyldermans, S., Lahoutte, T., Caveliers, V.

Assessment of IP injection of [<SUP>18</SUP>F]fallypride for behavioral neuroimaging in rats	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Dopamine; Small animal imaging; Fallypride; D2 receptor; Positron emission tomography; Behavioral neuroimaging	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DOPAMINE RELEASE; IN-VIVO; 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; PET; BINDING; BRAIN; ISOFLURANE; RADIOLIGAND; KETAMINE	Great progress has been made toward using small animal PET to assess neurochemical changes during behavior. [F-18]fallypride (FAL) is a D-2/D-3 antagonist that is sensitive to changes in endogenous dopamine, and, in theory, could be used to assess changes in dopamine during behavioral paradigms. Tail vein injections of tracer require restraint in awake animals, and catheter implantation is invasive and can cause logistical problems. Thus, administering tracer with IP injections (which are well-tolerated by rodents) would be preferable. The purpose of this study was to determine whether IP injection of FAL would produce striatal uptake similar to that seen with traditional IV tail vein injection protocols. Four male Sprague Dawley rats underwent IP injection of FAL, followed by a 30-min uptake and subsequent dynamic image acquisition on the IndyPET III small animal scanner. Three of these rats also received traditional dynamic scanning with IV FAL injection via a tail vein. Two rats that received IP injection had moderate striatal uptake, with striatum/cerebellum ratios (SUVR) that were only similar to 20% lower than ratios from IV scans. Two other rats had little to no uptake; SUVR values were similar to 70% lower than IV SUVR. These latter two animals showed heavy bone uptake, evidence of defluorination of FAL The results of this pilot study suggest that it may be possible to achieve striatal uptake of FAL after IP injection. However, this was not seen consistently across animals. Future studies are needed to validate, and then to optimize, the use of IP FAL for behavioral imaging protocols. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Regulation of Pigmentation in Human Epidermal Melanocytes by Functional High-Affinity β-Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormone/Melanocortin-4 Receptor Signaling	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							HUMAN MC1 RECEPTOR; MELANOCORTIN-4 RECEPTOR; MSH RECEPTORS; INDUCED MELANOGENESIS; ENERGY HOMEOSTASIS; MAMMALIAN SKIN; CELL-LINE; ALPHA-MSH; EXPRESSION; HORMONE	To date, the principal receptor considered to regulate human pigmentation is the melanocortin-1 receptor (MC1-R) via induction of the cAMP/protein kinase A pathway by the melanocortins alpha-MSH and ACTH. In this context, it is noteworthy that beta-MSH can also induce melanogenesis, although it has a low affinity for the MC1-R, whereas the preferred receptor for this melanocortin is the MC4-R. Because beta-MSH is present in the epidermal compartment, it was of interest to ascertain whether functioning MC4-Rs are present in human epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes. Our results provide evidence that the MC4- R is expressed in situ and in vitro throughout the human epidermis at the mRNA and protein level using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and double immunofluorescence staining. Moreover, radioligand binding studies yielded high-affinity receptors for beta-MSH on epidermal melanocytes (3600 receptors per cell), undifferentiated keratinocytes (7200 receptors per cell), and differentiated keratinocytes (72,700 receptors per cell), indicating that MC4- R expression correlates with epidermal differentiation. Importantly, increased melanogenesis after stimulation of the beta-MSH/cAMP/microphthalmia-associated transcription factor/tyrosinase cascade proved the functionality of this signal in melanocytes, which was attenuated in the presence of the specific MC4- R antagonist HS014. In summary, our results imply an important role for the beta-MSH/MC4-R cascade in human melanocyte biology, although the function and purpose of this signal in keratinocytes needs further elucidation.

The [C-11]methylamino group of [C-11]6-OH-BTA-1 was formally replaced by a fluoroethyl group in a cold synthesis via N-alkylation of N-Boc-2-(4'-aminophenyl)-6-(methoxyethoxymethoxy)benzothiazole with fluoroethyl tosylate. Subsequent deprotection gave the target compound 2-[4'-(2-fluoroethyl)aminophenyl]-6-hydroxybenzothiazole (FBTA). In a radioligand competition assay on aggregated synthetic amyloid fibrils using N-[H-3-methyl]6-OH-BTA-1, 100 nM FBTA inhibited binding with 93 +/- 1 and 83 +/- 11% efficiency for A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42), respectively. For the radiosynthesis a precursor carrying a tosylethyl moiety was prepared allowing the introduction of [F-18]fluoride via nucleophilic substitution with [F-18]tetra-n-butyl-ammonium fluoride (TBAF). Subsequent removal of all protecting groups was performed in a one-pot procedure followed by semi-preparative HPLC, delivering the target compound [F-18]FBTA in good radiochemical yield of 21% on average and radiochemical purity of >= 98% at EOS. In vitro autoradiography on human postmortem AD brain tissue slices showed intense cortical binding of [F-18]FBTA (11 nM), which was displaced in presence of 6-OH-BTA-1 (1 mu M). Brain up-take was evaluated in wild-type (wt) mice with microPET imaging. Based on these results, [F-18]FBTA appears to be a suitable candidate tracer for amyloid imaging in humans.

Double-stranded RNA increases kinin B1 receptor expression and function in human airway epithelial cells	INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	2nd International Conference on Exploring the Future of Vascular and Inflammatory Mediators (KININ 2007)	MAY 30-JUN 02, 2007	Berlin, GERMANY			airway; dsRNA; epithelial; kinin; viral	NF-KAPPA-B; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR-3; TISSUE KALLIKREIN; IN-VIVO; RHINOVIRUS STIMULATION; ASTHMATIC SUBJECTS; NASAL SECRETIONS; BRADYKININ B-1; UP-REGULATION; ACTIVATION	Increased levels of kinins have been detected within the airways during upper respiratory viral infections (URIs). Rhinovirus, the major URI associated with acute exacerbations of asthma, is an ssRNA virus that primarily infects the airway epithelium and produces dsRNA during replication. We asked whether dsRNA could increase the expression of kinin receptors in airway epithelial cells, thereby potentiating the inflammatory consequences of kinin generation. Human airway epithelial cell line BEAS-2B was stimulated with the dsRNA analog Poly I:C and kinin receptor expression detected by quantitative RT-PCR as well as radioligand binding. Poly I:C induced an increase in B1 and B2 receptor mRNA levels in BEAS-2B and primary human normal bronchial epithelial cells. At the cell surface, only B1 receptor expression was increased by Poly I:C. Furthermore, pretreatment of BEAS-2B cells with Poly I:C enhanced the induction of phospho-ERK following B I receptor ligand stimulation. To investigate whether these finding had potential in vivo relevance, we assessed B I receptor expression in nasal tissue obtained from 8 nonnal human subjects with URIs and 3 control subjects. Five of the URI subjects demonstrated increased B1 receptor mRNA compared to the 3 control subjects. We suggest that increased expression of B1 receptor in the human airway following a URI could increase the risk of an exacerbation of asthma by contributing to increased inflammation in the airway.

This amino acid mediates learning and memory processes acting through ionotropic and metabotropic receptor binding. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) are G proteincoupled receptors that stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) or inhibit adenylyl cyclase (AC). MGluRs have been widely described in CNS. However, little is known about these receptors in peripheral system. The present work describes the mGluR/PLC pathway in membranes from pregnant and non-pregnant rat heart by radioligand binding, Western-blot assays and PLC activity determination. Furthermore, mRNA coding mGluR(1), mGIuR(5), alpha G(q/11) and PLC beta(1) was identified by RT-PCR. Binding assays indicated total mGlu receptor numbers of 4.7 +/- 0.2 pmol/mg protein and 4.2 +/- 1.0 pmol/mg protein in non-pregnant and pregnant rats respectively, and their corresponding K-D values were 545.3 +/- 85.6 nM and 1062.8 +/- 393.6 nM. Western blots revealed bands corresponding to mGluR(1) and mGluR(5) receptors, confirming that these receptors are expressed in heart. The, isoform of PLC, which mediates group I mGluRs (mGluR I) response, was also expressed in rat heart. Moreover, PLC activity was modulated by calcium in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, specific agonists for mGluRs increased the PLC activity and the increase was prevented by specific mGluR antagonists. These results demonstrate the presence of group I mGlu receptors and their functional coupling to the PLC stimulation in female rat heart, suggesting a possible role of mGluR/PLC pathway in this tissue.

Here, we extended this analysis to amphetamine ( AMPH; 0.5, 1, and 5 mg/kg, i.p.) and found that the individual differences in behavioral activation were not as pronounced as with COC. This was confirmed with observational analysis of behaviors. Differences in drug-induced activation could involve differential dopamine transporter (DAT) function/trafficking. To address this possibility, we measured [H-3] DA uptake into dorsal striatal synaptosomes prepared from rats injected 30 min earlier with saline, COC, or AMPH to determine DAT activity, and radioligand binding to determine the total number of DATs. Striatal [H-3] DA uptake in COC-treated HCRs was significantly higher than in LCRs. Furthermore, regardless of LCR/HCR classification, uptake in individual COC-treated rats was significantly correlated with their locomotor behavior in the 30 min after drug administration. In contrast, AMPH-treated rats did not differ in uptake, nor were uptake and locomotor activity correlated. DAT number did not differ between LCRs or HCRs, or between AMPH-treated rats. In addition, when individual differences in COC-induced behavior were no longer detected in LCRs and HCRs 1 week after initial classification, uptake was also similar. Together, these results suggest that a difference in expression of functional DATs on the cell surface contributes to the individual differences observed in COC-induced, but not AMPH-induced, behavioral activation of rats.

In this study, we investigated the effects of chronic administration of NO on the ANG II receptor type 1 (AT1) expression and aldosterone synthesis. ZG cells were treated daily with DETA NONOate (10(-4) M), an NO donor, for 0, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, stably transfected with the AT1B receptor, were used as a positive control. Western blot analysis indicated that AT1 receptor expression was decreased as a function of time of NO administration in both CHO and ZG cells. ANG II binding to its receptors was determined by radioligand binding. NO treatment of ZG cells for 96 h resulted in a decrease in ANG II binding compared with control. The receptor density was decreased to 1,864+/-129 fmol/mg protein from 3,157+/-220 fmol/mg protein (P<0.005), but the affinity was not changed (1.95 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.88 +/- 0.21 nM). Confocal Raman microspectroscopy and immunocytochemistry both confirmed that the expression of AT1 receptors in ZG cells decreased with chronic NO administration. In addition, chronic NO administration also decreased the expression of cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme in ZG cells and inhibited ANG II- and 25-hydroxycholesterol-stimulated aldosterone synthesis in ZG cells. This study demonstrates that chronic administration of NO inhibits aldosterone synthesis in ZG cells by downregulation of the expression of both AT1 receptors and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme.

Many actions of antidepressant drugs cannot yet be studied using positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging due to lack of suitable radioligands. We believe that mirtazapine, radiolabeled with C-11, might be suitable for PET neuroimaging of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in selected regions of the living human brain. Objective. To determine the regional central biodistribution and pharmacokinetics of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine in humans. Methods. Five healthy volunteers received an intravenous injection of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine for evaluating its metabolism, biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Results. [N-methyl-C-11]Mirtazapine entered the brain readily, with initial clearance from blood to tissue (K-1) ranging from 0.31 ml/ml/min in amygdala to 0.54 ml/ml/min in thalamus. The rate of metabolism of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine in the bloodstream was relatively slow, with 20-40% of [C-11]-derived radioactivity still present as parent compound at 60 min post-injection. The clearance of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine from the tissue compartment (k(2)') ranged from a low of 0.03 min(-1) in amygdala to a high of 0.06-0.07 min(-1) in thalamus and cerebellum. The volume of distribution (V-e') of [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine was markedly greater in hippocampus and amygdala (11.3-12.0) than in cerebellum (6.7), with intermediate levels in the thalamus (9.4). Conclusions. [N-methyl-C-11]Mirtazapine has suitable properties for PET neuroimaging. We envision [N-methyl-C-11]mirtazapine as a molecular probe for PET imaging of antidepressant actions at sites such as alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the living human brain.

Animals - 4 healthy adult cows. Procedure - Bovine neutrophil membranes were isolated for association, dissociation, and saturation binding experiments with PAF labeled with hydrogen 3 (H-3-PAF). The RT-PCR assay was performed with appropriate human primers, and western blot analysis was developed with a polyclonal antibody obtained from a peptide of bovine PAF receptor. Results - Analysis of kinetic binding data supported a single class of PAF receptor. Binding of H-3-PAF to membrane preparations was selectively displaced by PAF and a nonhydrolyzable analogue of guanine triphosphate (Gpp[NH]p) and by lyso-PAF (a biologically inactive analogue of PAF) to a lesser extent. Among other PAF receptor antagonists, 14-deoxyandrographolide and WEB 2086 were the most effective in inhibiting H-3-PAF binding sites in neutrophil membranes; 2 lignans, schisandrin-A and gamma-schisandrin were also effective, but 2 gingkolides (BN52020 and BN52021) only mildly inhibited H-3-PAF binding. Results of RT-PCR assay and western blot analysis of neutrophil crude membranes confirmed the presence of a PAF receptor. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Results indicated that bovine neutrophils express only 1 type of PAF receptor, and it is likely that this receptor is involved in inflammatory responses. The most effective PAF antagonists were 14-deoxyandrographolide and WEB 2086; these PAF antagonists may be potentially useful in the treatment of inflammatory processes in cattle.

Amer Heart Assoc Council High Blood Pressure Res		dopamine; kidney; insulin resistance; obesity	INSULIN-RESISTANCE; PROXIMAL TUBULES; SODIUM; MUSCLE; MECHANISMS; BRL-49653; FAILS	Hypertension related to insulin resistance results from increased sodium retention. Dopamine, by activating D-1A receptors in renal proximal tubules, increases sodium excretion. Recently, dopamine has been shown to augment its own signaling by recruiting intracellular D-1A receptors to cell surface in proximal tubules. In this study, we hypothesized that coupling of D-1A receptors to G proteins and dopamine-induced recruitment of D-1A receptors to the plasma membrane are impaired in obese Zucker rats, resulting in a diminished natriuretic and diuretic response to D-1A receptor agonist, SKF-38393. We also examined effects of rosiglitazone (3 mg/kg per day, 15 days) in restoring the defects in D-1A receptor signaling and function in these animals. In obese rats, D-1A receptors did not couple to G proteins, as shown by a lack of fenoldopam-sensitive [S-35] GTPgammaS binding. In addition, we observed, by using radioligand binding and immunoblotting, that dopamine recruited D-1A receptors to cell surface in lean Zucker rats but failed to do so in obese rats. Rosiglitazone treatment resulted in restoration of G-protein coupling of D-1A receptors and their recruitment by dopamine in obese rats similar to that seen in lean rats. Furthermore, SKF-38393 failed to increase natriuresis and diuresis in obese rats compared with lean rats. However, in rosiglitazone-treated obese rats, SKF-38393 elicited a diuretic and natriuretic response similar to that in lean rats. Collectively, these results suggest that insulin resistance may be responsible for impaired renal dopamine D-1A receptor signaling and function as treatment with an insulin-sensitizer, rosiglitazone, normalizes these parameters in obese Zucker rats.

Substance P has greater affinity for NK1, and neurokinin A (NKA) for NK2 receptor subtype. Although only NK1 receptor has been characterized in the anterior pituitary gland, some evidence suggests the existence of NK2 receptors in this gland. Therefore, we investigated the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland of male rats by radioligand binding studies using labeled SR48968, a non peptidic specific antagonist. [H-3]SR48968 specific binding to cultured anterior pituitary cells was time-dependent and saturable, but with a lower affinity than previously reported values for cells expressing NK2 receptors. Unlabeled NKA inhibited only partially [H-3]SR48968 specific binding to whole anterior pituitary cells. Since SR48968 is a non polar molecule, we performed experiments to discriminate surface from intracellular binding sites. SR48968 exhibited both surface and intracellular specific binding. Analysis of the surface-bound ligand indicated that [H-3]SR48968 binds to one class of receptor with high affinity. Neurokinin A completely displaced [H-3]SR48968 surface specific binding fitting to a two-site/two-state model with high and low affinity. Additionally, immumocytochemical studies showed that the NK2 receptor is expressed at least in a subset of lactotropes. These results demonstrate the presence of NK2 receptors in the anterior pituitary gland and suggest that NKA actions in this gland are mediated, at least in part.. by the NK2 receptor subtype.

However, there is some evidence that dopaminergic effects are involved in the cardiovascular actions of these drugs. Here, we evaluated this association in humans. Methods: Positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride, a dopamine (DA) D2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous DA for occupancy of the D2 receptors, were used to measure changes in brain DA after different doses of intravenous methylpbenidate in 14 healthy subjects. Cardiovascular (heart rate and blood pressure) and catecholamine (plasma epinephrine and norepineprhine) responses were determined in parallel to assess their relationships to methylphenidate-induced changes in brain DA. Results: Methylphenidate administration significantly increased heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and epinephrine concentration in plasma. The increases in blood pressure were significantly correlated with methylphenidate-induced increases of DA in striatum (r>0.78, P<0.001) and of plasma epinephrine levels (r>0.82, P<0.0005). In turn methylphenidate-induced DA increases in striatum were correlated with increases of epinephrine in plasma (r=0.85, P<0.0001). Subjects in whom methylphenidate did not increase DA had no change in blood pressure or in plasma epinephrine concentration. Discussion: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that methylphenidate-induced increases in blood pressure are in part due to its central dopaminergic effects. They also suggest that methylphenidate's pressor effects may be in part mediated by DA-induced increases in peripheral epinephrine.

J	Joyce, PI; Rizzi, D; Caló, G; Rowbotham, DJ; Lambert, DG				Joyce, PI; Rizzi, D; Caló, G; Rowbotham, DJ; Lambert, DG			The effect of guanethidine and local anesthetics on the electrically stimulated mouse vas deferens	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							NOREPINEPHRINE UPTAKE SITES; H-3 NISOXETINE; RELIEF; RADIOLIGAND; TRANSPORTER; CAUSALGIA	Complex regional pain syndrome is often treated with the sympatholytic guanethidine and a local anesthetic in a Bier's block. The efficacy of this treatment has been questioned. Because local anesthetics inhibit the norepinephrine uptake transporter, we hypothesized that this variable efficacy results from the local inhibiting the uptake of guanethidine. In this study, we tested this hypothesis by using a sympathetically innervated mouse vas deferens preparation. Organ bath-mounted mouse vasa deferentia were electrically stimulated in the absence and presence of guanethidine, prilocaine, procaine, and cocaine in various combinations. Prilocaine (1 mM) induced an immediate inhibition of twitch response (maximum 100% after 2 min) that fully reversed after washing. Guanethidine (3 muM) also inhibited twitching by 95% +/- 3% in 15 min, but this effect was only partially reversed after I h of washing (33% +/- 12% of control). When prilocaine and guanethidine were added in combination, a reversal of 80% +/- 13% (at 1 h) was observed. Procaine (300 muM) produced a transient increase (152% +/- 14%) in response. When co-incubated with guanethidine (3 muM), the twitch was reduced to 24% +/- 4% of control and was reversed to 77% +/- 7% after 1 h. Cocaine (30 muM) inhibited the twitch response to 53% +/- 8%, which was fully reversed by 1 h of washing. When co-incubated with guanethidine, the response was reduced to 39% +/- 6% of control and was reversed to 86% +/- 10% after 1 h. In all cases, the reversal produced by the combination was significantly more intense (P < 0.05) than that produced by guanethidine alone. Local anesthetics reduce the sympatholytic actions of guanethidine, and this may explain the variable efficacy of guanethidine in the treatment of complex regional pain syndrome.

An endogenous, low molecular weight (LMW) inhibitor from Alzheimer's brain inactivates the human brain muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR). The inhibitor prevents agonist and antagonist binding to the mAChR as assesssed by radioligand binding studies. The LMW endogenous inhibitor, which has components with molecular weights between 100 and 1000 Da, requires dissolved oxygen and glutathione. Prevention of inactivation of the mAChR with peroxidase suggests that the LMW endogenous inhibitor generates peroxide. Heme, previously shown to be present in the LMW endogenous inhibitor, also inactivates the mAChR in the presence of peroxide. Free radical damage to the muscarinic receptor by the endogenous inhibitor can be prevented through the use of naturally occurring antioxidants including bilirubin, biliverdin, carnosol, myricetin and quericetin. In addition, pyrophosphate, imidodiphosphate, bisphosphonates and related compounds also protect the muscarinic receptor from free radical damage. Inactivation of the mAChR by the LMW endogenous inhibitor is likely to be a factor in the continual decline of Alzheimer's patients, even those taking acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. Natural antioxidants and pyrophosphate analogs may improve the effectiveness of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and prove useful in the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease since the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is required for memory, and decreased cholinergic function is a critical deficit in Alzheimer's disease.

The inhibitory effect of these drugs was investigated on recombinant wild-type and mutant Kir6.2/SUR1 channels expressed in HEK293 cells. Nateglinide and repaglinide dose-dependently inhibited whole-cell Kir6.2/SUR1 currents with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 800 and 21 nmol/l, respectively. Mutation of serine 1237 in SUR1 to tyrosine (S1237Y) abolished tolbutamide and nateglinide block, suggesting that these drugs share a common point of interaction on the SUR1 subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel. In contrast, repaglinide inhibition was unaffected by the S1237Y mutation (IC50 = 23 nmol/l). Radioligand binding studies revealed a single high-affinity binding site for [H-3]repaglinide on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing wildtype (equilibrium dissociation constant [K-D] = 0.40 nmol/l) or mutant (K-D, = 0.31 nmol/l) Kir6.2/SUR1 channels. Nateglinide and tolbutamide displaced [(3) H]repaglinide binding to wild-type channels with IC50 values of 0.7 and 26 mumol/l, respectively, but produced <10% displacement of [H-3]repaglinide bound to mutant channels. This is consistent with the idea that binding of nateglinide and tolbutamide, but not repaglinide, is abolished by the SUR1[S1237Y] mutation and that the binding site for repaglinide is not identical to that of nateglinde/tolbutamide. These results are discussed in terms of a conformational analysis of the drug molecules.

The IPIP stereoisomers were synthesized via a chiral intermediate in >95% enantiomeric excess. The R-isomers demonstrated a M-1 to M-2 subtype selectivity of approximately 3 to 1 and the S-isomers demonstrated non-subtype selective binding in vitro. IPIP was radiolabeled with iodide-125 with an average radiochemical yield of 74.4% (+/- 14.8, n=5), specific activities >800 mCi/mu mol, and radiochemical purities >97%. In vivo the Z-isomers demonstrated high uniform cerebral uptake suggesting non-subtype selective binding, In contrast, E-R-IPIP, after allowing a low uptake in M2 rich areas to clear, demonstrated a retention of activity in M-1 and M-4 rich cerebral regions. In addition, the cerebral uptake of E-R-IPIP and Z-S-IPIP were inhibited by 70-90% via pretreatment with R-QNB, an established muscarinic antagonist. An ex vivo metabolism study demonstrated Z-S-IPIP was stable at the receptor site with an absence of radiolabeled metabolites. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we report that a non-peptide compound, T-0632, binds with micromolar affinity to the human GLP-1R and blocks GLP-1-induced cAMP production. Furthermore, the observation that T-0632 has almost 100-fold selectivity for the human versus the highly homologous rat GLP-1R provided an opportunity to map determinants of non-peptide binding. Radioligand competition experiments utilizing a series of chimeric human/rat GLP-1R constructs revealed that partial substitution of the amino terminus of the rat GLP-1R with the corresponding sequence from the human homolog was sufficient to confer high T-0632 affinity. Follow-up analysis of receptors where individual candidate amino acids had been exchanged between the human and rat GLP-1Rs identified a single residue that explained species selectivity of non-peptide binding. Replacement of tryptophan 33 in the human GLP-1R by serine (the homologous amino acid in the rat GLP-1R) resulted in a 100-fold loss of T-0632 affinity, whereas the converse mutation in the rat GLP-1R led to a reciprocal gain-of-function phenotype. These observations suggest that in a class B receptor, important determinants of non-peptide affinity reside within the extracellular amino-terminal domain. Compound T-0632 may mimic, and thereby interfere with, the putative "pseudo-tethering" mechanism by which the amino terminus of class B receptors initiates the binding of cognate hormones.

Although this has significant clinical implications, the underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. Methods and Results-Forty-nine consecutive patients submitted for mitral valve surgery were investigated. Twenty-three were in persistent AF (greater than or equal to3 months); the others were in sinus rhythm. Before extracorporal circulation, the right atrial appendage was excised. beta -Adrenoceptors were quantified by radioligand binding, and G proteins were quantified by Western blot analysis. The isometric contractile response to Ca2+, isoproterenol, Bay K8644, and the postrest potentiation of contractile force were investigated in thin atrial trabeculae, which were also examined histologically. The contractile force of the atrial preparations obtained from AF patients was 75% less than that in preparations from patients in sinus rhythm. Also, the positive inotropic effect of isoproterenol was impaired, and Bay K8644 failed to increase atrial contractile force, In contrast, the response to extracellular Ca2+ was maintained, and the postrest potentiation was preserved. P-Adrenoceptor density and G-protein expression were unchanged. Histological examination revealed 14% more myolysis in the atria of AF patients. Conclusions-After prolonged AF, atrial contractility was reduced by 75%, The impairment of P-adrenergic modulation of contractile force cannot be explained by downregulation of beta -adrenoceptors or changes in G proteins. Dysfunction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum does not occur after prolonged AF. Failure of Bay K8644 to restore contractility suggests that the L-type Ca2+ channel is responsible for the contractile dysfunction, The restoration of contractile force by high extracellular Ca2+ shows that the contractile apparatus itself is nearly completely preserved after prolonged AF.

Deletion of the NR2 C-terminal ESDV motifs resulted in the loss of this increase following coexpression of NR1-1a/NR2A(Trunc) and NR1-1a/NR2B(Trunc) with PSD-95. Characterisation of the radioligand binding properties of [H-3]MK-801 to NR1-1a/ NR2A receptors with or without PSD-95 showed that PSD-95 induced a threefold increase in B-max values and an apparent approximately fivefold decrease in affinity in the presence of 10 muM L-glutamate. In the presence of 1 mM L-glutamate, the K-i for MK-801 binding to NR1-1a/ NR2A with PSD-95 was not significantly different from that for NR1-1a/NR2A without PSD-95. The EC50 value for the enhancement of [H-3]MK-801 binding by L-glutamate to NR1-1a/NR2A was 1.8 +/- 0.4 (n = 4) and 8.9 (mean of n = 2) muM in the absence and presence of PSD-95, respectively. Thus, coexpression of PSD-95 with NR1-1a/NR2A results in a decreased sensitivity to L-glutamate and an enhanced expression of NR2A and NR2B subunits. Deletion studies show that this effect is mediated via interaction of the C-terminal ESDV motif of the NR2 subunit with PSD-95.

Because these compounds have some structural resemblance to the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T-4), it was suggested that they may interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism and transport, e.g., by competition with T-4 on transthyretin (TTR). In the present study, we investigated the possible interaction of several brominated flame retardants with T-4 binding to TTR in an in vitro competitive binding assay, using human TTR and I-125-T-4 as the displaceable radioligand. Compounds were tested in at least eight different concentrations ranging from 1.95 to 500 nM. In addition, we investigated the structural requirements of these and related ligands for competitive binding to TTR. We were able to show very potent competition binding for TBBPA and PBP (10.6- and 7.1-fold stronger than the natural ligand T-4, respectively). PBDEs were able to compete with T-4-TTR binding only after metabolic conversion by induced rat liver microsomes, suggesting an important role for hydroxylation. Brominated bisphenols with a high degree of bromination appeared to be more efficient competitors, whereas chlorinated bisphenols were less potent compared to their brominated analogues. These results indicate that brominated flame retardants, especially the brominated phenols and tetrabromobisphenol A, are very potent competitors for T-4 binding to human transthyretin in vitro and may have effects on thyroid hormone homeostasis in vivo comparable to the thyroid-disrupting effects of PCBs.

J	Baumann, MH; Rothman, RB; Ali, SF				Baumann, MH; Rothman, RB; Ali, SF			Comparative neurobiological effects of ibogaine and MK-801 in rats	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						ibogaine; MK-801; dopamine; corticosterone; prolactin; addiction	NMDA RECEPTOR COMPLEX; ANTI-ADDICTIVE DRUG; RADIOLIGAND-BINDING; IN-VIVO; MORPHINE; DOPAMINE; COCAINE; MECHANISMS; METABOLITE; ANTAGONIST	Ibogaine is a plant-derived alkaloid with putative 'anti-addictive' properties. Although ibogaine binds to multiple targets in the brain, recent evidence suggests the drug acts as an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist similar to MK-801. The purpose of the present study was to compare neurochemical and neuroendocrine effects of ibogaine and MK-801 in vivo. Male rats received either i.p. saline, ibogaine (10 and 100 mg/kg), or MK-801 (0.1 and 1 mg/kg). Groups of rats (N = 6-8/group) were decapitated 30 or 60 min after injection. Brains were harvested for analysis of dopamine (DA) and its metabolites, while trunk blood was collected for analysis of plasma corticosterone and prolactin. Ibogaine produced marked dose-dependent reductions in tissue DA with concurrent increases in the metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA). This profile of ibogaine-induced effects on DA metabolism was consistently observed in the cortex, striatum: olfactory tubercle, and hypothalamus. MK-801, on the other hand, did not reduce DA levels in any brain region but did cause modest region-specific elevations in DA metabolites. Ibogaine and MK-801 caused comparable elevations in circulating corticosterone, but only ibogaine increased prolactin. The present findings show that the effects of ibogaine on DA neurotransmission and neuroendocrine secretion are not fully mimicked by MK-801. Thus, the wide spectrum of in vivo actions of ibogaine can probably not be explained simply on the basis of antagonism at NMDA receptors. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

NT34, that can distinguish between rat and human neurotensin receptors, and exhibits more than a 100-fold difference in binding affinities and a 60-fold difference in functional coupling to phosphatidylinositol turnover. Using cells transfected with different numbers of the appropriate receptors, we measured the changes in phosphatidylinositol production, and then evaluated the efficiency of receptor effector coupling based on Furchgott's design. The binding of NT34 at both rat and human neurotensin receptors stably expressed in CHO-K1 cells was to two sites, while the binding of NT was to one site. at the rat receptor the equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) for NT34 at the high-affinity site was 0.058 nM, while that at the low-affinity site was 3.1 nM. For the human receptor at the high-affinity site, the K-d for NT34 was 18 nM. while that at the low-affinity site was 180 nM. For both species the percentage of receptors representing the high-affinity site was approximate to 60-70% with 30-40% at the low-affinity site. We derived agonist dissociation constants (K-a) for NT and NT34, which suggest that for NT34, the low-affinity site is functionally coupled to phosphatidy[inositol turnover. Finally, we compared the relative efficacies of both compounds and found that NT34 was was about 2-fold and 4-fold more efficacious than NT in stimulating phosphatidy[inositol turnover in rat and human MT receptors, respectively.

Methods: We enrolled 16 patients with ET, 17 with PD, and 18 healthy controls (HC). Each participant underwent comprehensive clinical evaluations, kinematic assessments of finger tapping. ET and PD patients underwent DAT-SPECT imaging. The DAT-SPECT scans were subjected to both visual and semi-quantitative analysis using DaTQUANT (R). We then investigated the correlations between the clinical, kinematic, and DAT-SPECT data, in patients. Results: Our findings confirm that individuals with ET exhibited slower finger tapping than HC. Visual evaluation of radiotracer uptake in both striata demonstrated normal levels within the ET patient cohort, while PD patients displayed reduced uptake. However, there was notable heterogeneity in the quantification of uptake within the striata among ET patients. Additionally, we found a correlation between the amount of radiotracer uptake in the striatum and movement velocity during finger tapping in patients. Specifically, lower radioligand uptake corresponded to decreased movement velocity (ET: coef. = 0.53, p-adj = 0.03; PD: coef. = 0.59, p-adj = 0.01). Conclusion: The study's findings suggest a potential link between subtle changes in central dopaminergic tone and altered voluntary movement execution, in ET. These results provide further insights into the pathophysiology of ET. However, longitudinal studies are essential to determine whether the slight reduction in dopaminergic tone observed in ET patients represents a distinct subtype of the disease or could serve as a predictor for the clinical progression into PD.

Michael			Proof-of-concept optimization of a copper-mediated <SUP>18</SUP>F-radiosynthesis of a novel MAGL PET tracer on a high-throughput microdroplet platform and its macroscale translation	LAB ON A CHIP			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; FLUORINATION; F-18; RADIOFLUORINATION; F-18-FLUORINATION; RADIOCHEMISTRY; MICROFLUIDICS; RADIOTRACER; TRANSPORT; FLUORIDE	Copper-mediated radiofluorination has demonstrated remarkable potential in forming aromatic C-F-18 bonds of radioligands for positron emission tomography (PET). Achieving optimal results often requires optimization efforts, requiring a substantial amount of radiolabeling precursor and time, severely limiting the experimental throughput. Recently, we successfully showcased the feasibility of performing and optimizing Cu-mediated radiosynthesis on a high-throughput microdroplet platform using the well-known and clinically used radioligand [F-18]FDOPA as an illustrative example. In our current work, we optimized the Cu-mediated synthesis of a novel monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) PET tracer ([F-18]YH149), showing the versatility of droplet-based techniques for early stage tracer development. Across 5 days, we conducted a total of 117 experiments, studying 36 distinct conditions, while utilizing <15 mg of total organoboron precursor. Compared to the original report in which the radiochemical yield (RCY) was 4.4 +/- 0.5% (n = 5), the optimized droplet condition provided a substantial improvement in RCY (52 +/- 8%, n = 4) and showed excellent radiochemical purity (100%) and molar activity (77-854 GBq mu mol(-1)), using a starting activity of 0.2-1.45 GBq. Furthermore, we showed for the first time a translation of the optimized microscale conditions to a vial-based method. With similar starting activity (0.2-1.44 GBq), the translated synthesis exhibited a comparable RCY of 50 +/- 10% (n = 4) while maintaining excellent radiochemical purity (100%) and acceptable molar activity (20-46 GBq mu mol(-1)). The successful translation to vial-based reactions ensures wider applicability of the optimized synthesis by leveraging widely available commercial vial-based synthesis modules.

In this positron emission tomography (PET) study, we measured whether D2R availability is associated with subsequent alcohol use and alcohol-related factors, at a follow-up 8 to 16 years post-PET scan, in social drinkers. DesignLongitudinal study investigating the association between PET data and later self-report measures in healthy individuals. SettingAcademic research imaging centre in Stockholm, Sweden. ParticipantsThere were 71 individuals (68 of whom had evaluable PET data, 5 females, 42.0 years mean age) from a series of previous PET studies. MeasurementsOne PET examination with the D2R antagonist radioligand [C-11]raclopride at baseline and self-report measures assessing alcohol use, drug use, impulsivity, reward sensitivity and family history of alcohol or substance use disorder at follow-up. FindingsWe found no evidence for an association between D2R availability and later alcohol use (B = -0.019, B 95% CI = -0.043 to -0.006, P = 0.147) nor for the majority of the alcohol-related factors (B 95% CI = -0.034 to 0.004, P = 0.273-0.288). A negative association with a small effect size was found between D2R availability and later impulsivity (B = -0.017, B 95% CI = -0.034 to -0.001, P = 0.046). ConclusionsLow striatal dopamine D2 receptor availability may not be a strong predictor in the development of alcohol use disorder.

Cost-effectiveness of the implementation of [<SUP>68</SUP>Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT at initial prostate cancer staging	INSIGHTS INTO IMAGING			English	Article						Prostate cancer; PSMA PET; CT; Cost-effectiveness; Radioligand; Gallium	LYMPH-NODE DISSECTION; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; OUTCOMES; GA-68; MEN	Background Despite its high specificity, PSMA PET/CT has a moderate to low sensitivity of 40-50% for pelvic lymph node detection, implicating that a negative PSMA PET/CT cannot rule out lymph node metastases. This study investigates a strategy of implementing PSMA PET/CT for initial prostate cancer staging and treatment planning compared to conventional diagnostics. In this PSMA PET/CT strategy, a bilateral extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) is only performed in case of a negative PSMA PET/CT; in case of a positive scan treatment planning is solely based on PSMA PET/CT results. Method A decision table and lifetime state transition model were created. Quality-adjusted life years and health care costs were modelled over lifetime. Results The PSMA PET/CT strategy of treatment planning based on initial staging with [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT results in cost-savings of euro674 and a small loss in quality of life (QoL), 0.011 QALY per patient. The positive effect of [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT was caused by abandoning both an ePLND and unnecessary treatment in iM1 patients, saving costs and resulting in higher QoL. The negative effect was caused by lower QoL and high costs in the false palliative state, due to pN1(lim) patients (<= 4 pelvic lymph node metastases) being falsely diagnosed as iN1(ext) (> 4 pelvic lymph node metastases). These patients received subsequently palliative treatment instead of potentially curative therapy. Conclusion Initial staging and treatment planning based on [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT saves cost but results in small QALY loss due to the rate of false positive findings.	[van der Sar, Esmee C.

Non-Canonical Cannabinoid Receptors with Distinct Binding and Signaling Properties in Prostate and Other Cancer Cell Types Mediate Cell Death	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						cannabinoid receptors; non-canonical; prostate cancer; cytotoxicity; mitochondria; WIN-55; 212-2	ALKYLINDOLE-SENSITIVE RECEPTORS; ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY; IN-VITRO; CB1; INHIBITION; GPR55; EXPRESSION; APOPTOSIS; AGONIST; ENDOCANNABINOIDS	Cannabinoids exert anti-cancer actions; however, the underlying cytotoxic mechanisms and the cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) involved remain unclear. In this study, CBRs were characterized in several cancer cell lines. Radioligand binding screens surprisingly revealed specific binding only for the non-selective cannabinoid [H-3]WIN-55,212-2, and not [H-3]CP-55,940, indicating that the expressed CBRs exhibit atypical binding properties. Furthermore, [H-3]WIN-55,212-2 bound to a single site in all cancer cells with high affinity and varying densities. CBR characteristics were next compared between human prostate cancer cell lines expressing low (PC-3) and high (DU-145) CBR density. Although mRNA for canonical CBRs was detected in both cell lines, only 5 out of 15 compounds with known high affinity for canonical CBRs displaced [H-3]WIN-55,212-2 binding. Functional assays further established that CBRs in prostate cancer cells exhibit distinct signaling properties relative to canonical G(i)/G(o)-coupled CBRs. Prostate cancer cells chronically exposed to both CBR agonists and antagonists/inverse agonists produced receptor downregulation, inconsistent with actions at canonical CBRs. Treatment of DU-145 cells with CBR ligands increased LDH-release, decreased ATP-dependent cell viability, and produced mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization. In summary, several cancer cell lines express CBRs with binding and signaling profiles dissimilar to canonical CBRs. Drugs selectively targeting these atypical CBRs might exhibit improved anti-cancer properties.

Examination of the Novel Sigma-1 Receptor Antagonist, SI 1/28, for Antinociceptive and Anti-allodynic Efficacy against Multiple Types of Nociception with Fewer Liabilities of Use	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						sigma; sigma-1 receptor; antagonist; allodynia; analgesia; neuropathic pain; sedation	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; FORMALIN TEST; SPINAL-CORD; RAT; LIGANDS; COCAINE; DERIVATIVES; RADIOLIGAND; ANALGESICS	Neuropathic pain is a significant problem with few effective treatments lacking adverse effects. The sigma-1 receptor (S1R) is a potential therapeutic target for neuropathic pain, as antagonists for this receptor effectively ameliorate pain in both preclinical and clinical studies. The current research examines the antinociceptive and anti-allodynic efficacy of SI 1/28, a recently reported benzylpiperazine derivative and analog of the S1R antagonist SI 1/13, that was 423-fold more selective for S1R over the sigma-2 receptor (S2R). In addition, possible liabilities of respiration, sedation, and drug reinforcement caused by SI 1/28 have been evaluated. Inflammatory and chemical nociception, chronic nerve constriction injury (CCI) induced mechanical allodynia, and adverse effects of sedation in a rotarod assay, conditioned place preference (CPP), and changes in breath rate and locomotor activity were assessed after i.p. administration of SI 1/28. Pretreatment with SI 1/28 produced dose-dependent antinociception in the formalin test, with an ED50 (and 95% C.I.) value of 13.2 (7.42-28.3) mg/kg, i.p. Likewise, SI 1/28 produced dose-dependent antinociception against visceral nociception and anti-allodynia against CCI-induced neuropathic pain. SI 1/28 demonstrated no impairment of locomotor activity, conditioned place preference, or respiratory depression. In summary, SI 1/28 proved efficacious in the treatment of acute inflammatory pain and chronic neuropathy without liabilities at therapeutic doses, supporting the development of S1R antagonists as therapeutics for chronic pain.

The original study protocol was published in 2020. Here, we report amendments that have been made to the study protocol since the commencement of the trial. Changes in methods and materials: Two important changes were made to the original protocol: (1) the study will now use Lu-177-PSMA-617 instead of Lu-177-PSMA-I&T and (2) responding patients with residual disease on F-18-PSMA PET after the first two cycles are eligible to receive additional two cycles of 7.4 GBq Lu-177-PSMA in weeks 12 and 18, summing up to a maximum of 4 cycles if indicated. Therefore, patients receiving Lu-177-PSMA-617 will also receive an interim F-18-PSMA PET scan in week 4 after cycle 2. The title of this study was modified to; "Lutetium-177-PSMA in Oligo-metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer" and is now partly supported by Advanced Accelerator Applications, a Novartis Company. Conclusions: We present an update of the original study protocol prior to the completion of the study. Treatment arm patients that were included and received Lu-177-PSMA-I&T under the previous protocol will be replaced.	[Prive, Bastiaan M.; Janssen, Marcel J.

Several of these inhibitors have been radiolabeled for non-invasive imaging of PARP-1 expression or targeted radiotherapy of PARP-1 expressing tumors. In particular, derivatives of olaparib and rucaparib, which have reduced trapping potency by PARP-1 compared to talazoparib, have been radiolabeled for these purposes. Here, we report the first radiosynthesis of [F-18]talazoparib and its in vitro and in vivo evaluation. Talazoparib (3a '') and its bromo- or iodo-derivatives were synthesized as racemic mixtures (3a, 3b and 3c), and these compounds exhibit high affinity to PARP-1 (K-i for talazoparib (3a ''): 0.65 +/- 0.07 nM; 3a: 2.37 +/- 0.56 nM; 3b: 1.92 +/- 0.41 nM; 3c: 1.73 +/- 0.43 nM; known PARP-1 inhibitor Olaparib: 1.87 +/- 0.10 nM; non-PARP-1 compound Raclopride: >20,000 nM) in a competitive binding assay using a tritium-labeled PARP-1 radioligand [H-3]WC-DZ for screening. [F-18]Talazoparib (3a '') was radiosynthesized via a multiple-step procedure with good radiochemical and chiral purities (98%) and high molar activity (28 GBq/mu mol). The preliminary biodistribution studies in the murine PC-3 tumor model showed that [F-18]talazoparib had a good level of tumor uptake that persisted for over 8 h (3.78 +/- 0.55 %ID/gram at 4 h and 4.52 +/- 0.32 %ID/gram at 8 h). These studies show the potential for the bromo- and iodo- derivatives for PARP-1 targeted radiotherapy studies using therapeutic radionuclides.

(now Amgen Inc.). It has recently been approved as the first intravenous calcimimetic agent for secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in many countries. Etelcalcetide is an intravenous injectable drug that can be administered and eliminated through the dialysis circuit in chronic kidney disease patients. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro pharmacological profile and in vivo parathyroid hormone (PTH)- and Ca-lowering activities of etelcalcetide in a rat 5/6 nephrectomy model of chronic renal insufficiency with SHPT. Etelcalcetide increased the intracellular Ca concentration in HEK-293T cells expressing human Ca-sensing receptor with an EC50 value (95% confidence interval) of 0.53 mu M (0.28-1.0 mu M) and suppressed PTH secretion from rat parathyroid gland cells with 0.36 mu M (0.24-0.54 mu M) by activating Ca-sensing receptor. The specificity of etelcalcetide was evaluated by examining its ability to stimulate or inhibit radioligand binding to a panel of 34 off-target proteins. There were no significant changes in the presence of 10 mu M etelcalcetide. Furthermore, in a rat 5/6 nephrectomy model of chronic renal insufficiency with SHPT, single intravenous administration of etelcalcetide at 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mg/kg decreased plasma PTH and serum Ca levels. Taken together, the present findings identify etelcalcetide as a calcimimetic with potent PTH- and Ca-lowering effects via Ca-sensing receptor agonist activity.

However, the structural basis of benzodiazepine interactions with their high affinity site at GABA(A) receptors is controversially debated in the literature, and in silico studies led to discrepant binding mode hypotheses. In this study, computational docking of diazepam into alpha+/gamma 2- homology models suggested that a chiral methyl group, which is known to promote preferred binding to alpha 5-containing GABA(A) receptors (position 3 of the seven membered diazepine ring), could possibly provide experimental evidence that supports or contradicts the proposed binding modes. Thus, we investigated three pairs of R and S isomers of structurally different chemotypes, namely, diazepam, imidazobenzodiazepine, and triazolam derivatives. We used radioligand displacement studies as well as two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2-, alpha 2 beta 3 gamma 2-, alpha 3 beta 3 gamma 2-, and alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2-containing GABA(A) receptors to determine the ligand binding and functional activity of the three chemotypes. Interestingly, both imidazobenzodiazepine isomers displayed comparable binding affinities, while for the other two chemotypes, a discrepancy in binding affinities of the different isomers was observed. Specifically, the R isomers displayed a loss of binding, whereas the S isomers remained active. These findings are in accordance with the results of our in silico studies suggesting the usage of a different binding mode of imidazobenzodiazepines compared to those of the other two tested chemotypes. Hence, we conclude that different chemically related benzodiazepine ligands interact via distinct binding modes rather than by using a common binding mode.

Among them, (((R)-1-carboxy-2-mcercaptoethyl)carbamoyl)-L-glutamic acid (MCG) has been successfully labeled with radioisotopes for prostate cancer imaging. The aim of this study is to conjugate MCG with an albumin binding moiety to further improve the in vivo pharmacokinetics. MCG was conjugated with an Evans blue (EB) derivative for albumin binding and a DOTA chelator. PSMA positive (PC3-PIP) and PSMA negative (PC3) cells were used for both in vitro and in vivo studies. Longitudinal PET imaging was performed at 1, 4, 24, and 48 h post-injection to evaluate the biodistribution and tumor uptake of Y-86-DOTA-EB-MCG. DOTA-EB-MCG was also labeled with Y-90 for radionuclide therapy. Besides tumor growth measurement, tumor response to escalating therapeutic doses were also evaluated by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence microscopy. Based on quantification from Y-86-DOTA-EB-MCG PET images, the tracer uptake in PC3-PIP tumors increased from 22.33 +/- 2.39%ID/g at 1 h post-injection (p.i.), to the peak of 40.40 +/- 4.79%ID/g at 24 h p.i. Administration of 7.4 MBq of Y-90-DOTA-EB-MCG resulted in significant regression of tumor growth in PSMA positive xenografts. No apparent toxicity or body weight loss was observed in all treated mice. Modification of MCG with an Evans blue derivative resulted in a highly efficient prostate cancer targeting agent (EB-MCG), which showed great potential in prostate cancer treatment after being labeled with therapeutic radioisotopes.

Characterisation of endogenous A<sub>2A</sub> and A<sub>2B</sub> receptor-mediated cyclic AMP responses in HEK 293 cells using the GloSensor™ biosensor: Evidence for an allosteric mechanism of action for the A<sub>2B</sub>-selective antagonist PSB 603	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adenosine receptor; Cyclic AMP; Kinetics; Allosterism; PSB 603; A(2B) receptor	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ADENOSINE RECEPTOR; MAST-CELLS; DESENSITIZATION; AGONIST; POTENT; CAMP; PHARMACOLOGY; NONXANTHINE; RADIOLIGAND	Endogenous adenosine A(2B) receptors (A(2B)AR) mediate cAMP accumulation in HEK 293 cells. Here we have used a biosensor to investigate the mechanism of action of the A(2B)AR antagonist PSB 603 in HEK 293 cells. The A(2A) agonist CGS 21680 elicited a small response in these cells (circa 20% of that obtained with NECA), suggesting that they also contain a small population of A(2A) receptors. The responses to NECA and adenosine were antagonised by PSB 603, but not by the selective A(2A)AR antagonist SCH 58261. In contrast, CGS 21680 responses were not antagonised by high concentrations of PSB 603, but were sensitive to inhibition by SCH 58261. Analysis of the effect of increasing concentrations of PSB 603 on the response to NECA indicated a non-competitive mode of action yielding a marked reduction in the NECA E-MAX with no significant effect on EC50 values. Kinetics analysis of the effect of PSB 603 on the A(2B)AR-mediated NECA responses confirmed a saturable effect that was consistent with an allosteric mode of antagonism. The possibility that PSB 603 acts as a negative allosteric modulator of A(2B)AR suggests new approaches to the development of therapeutic agents to treat conditions where adenosine levels are high.

To unravel the molecular mechanism underlying these disorders and investigate possible pharmacological therapies, here we examined 13 disease-causing DAT mutants that were retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when heterologously expressed in HEK293 cells. In three of these mutants, i.e. hDAT-V158F, hDAT-G327R, and hDAT-L368Q, the folding deficit was remedied with the pharmacochaperone noribogaine or the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) inhibitor pifithrin- such that endoplasmic reticulum export of and radioligand binding and substrate uptake by these DAT mutants were restored. In Drosophila melanogaster, DAT deficiency results in reduced sleep. We therefore exploited the power of targeted transgene expression of mutant hDAT in Drosophila to explore whether these hDAT mutants could also be pharmacologically rescued in an intact organism. Noribogaine or pifithrin- treatment supported hDAT delivery to the presynaptic terminals of dopaminergic neurons and restored sleep to normal length in DAT-deficient (fumin) Drosophila lines expressing hDAT-V158F or hDAT-G327R. In contrast, expression of hDAT-L368Q in the Drosophila DAT mutant background caused developmental lethality, indicating a toxic action not remedied by pharmacochaperoning. Our observations identified those mutations most likely amenable to pharmacological rescue in the affected children. In addition, our findings also highlight the challenges of translating insights from pharmacochaperoning in cell culture to the clinical situation. Because of the evolutionary conservation in dopaminergic neurotransmission between Drosophila and people, pharmacochaperoning of DAT in D. melanogaster may allow us to bridge that gap.	[Asjad, H. M.

Endothelin receptor (ETR) antagonists are used for treatment of secondary pulmonary hypertension in VAD patients. However, the cardiac ETR regulation in human heart failure and during VAD support is incompletely understood. Methods In paired left ventricular samples of 12 dilated cardiomyopathy patients we investigated the density of endothelin A (ETA) and B (ETB) receptors before VAD implantation and after device removal. Left ventricular samples of 12 non-failing donor hearts served as control. Receptor quantification was performed by binding of [1251]-ET-1 in the presence of nonselective and ETA selective ETR ligands as competitors. Additionally, the ETR mRNA expression was analyzed using quantitative real-time-PCR. Results The mRNA of ETA but not ETB receptors was significantly elevated in heart failure, whereas total ETR density analyzed by radioligand binding was significantly reduced due to ETB receptor down regulation. ETA and ETB receptor density showed poor correlation to mRNA data (spearman correlation factor: 0.43 and 0.31, respectively). VAD support had no significant impact on the density of both receptors and on mRNA expression of ETA whereas ETB mRNA increased during VAD. A meta-analysis reveals that the ETA receptor regulation in human heart failure appears to depend on non-failing hearts. Conclusions In deteriorating hearts of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy the ETA receptor density is not changed whereas the ETB receptor is down regulated. The mRNA and the proteins of ETA and ETB show a weak correlation. Non-failing hearts might influence the interpretation of ETA receptor regulation. Mechanical unloading of the failing hearts has no impact on the myocardial ETR density.

To support their translational potential, we estimated the human radiation dose of (S)-(-)-[F-18]fluspidine and (R)-(+)-[F-18]fluspidine from ex vivo biodistribution and PET/MRI data in mice after extrapolation to the human scale. In addition, we validated the preclinical results by performing a first-in-human PET/CT study using (S)-(-)-[F-18]fluspidine. Based on the respective time-activity curves, we calculated using OLINDA the particular organ doses (ODs) and effective doses (EDs). The ED values of (S)-(-)-[F-18]fluspidine and (R)-(+)-[F-18]fluspidine differed significantly with image-derived values obtained in mice with 12.9 Sv/MBq and 14.0 Sv/MBq (p < 0.025), respectively. A comparable ratio was estimated from the biodistribution data. In the human study, the ED of (S)-(-)-[F-18]fluspidine was calculated as 21.0 Sv/MBq. Altogether, the ED values for both [F-18]fluspidine enantiomers determined from the preclinical studies are comparable with other F-18-labeled PET imaging agents. In addition, the first-in-human study confirmed that the radiation risk of (S)-(-)-[F-18]fluspidine imaging is within acceptable limits. However, as already shown for other PET tracers, the actual ED of (S)-(-)-[F-18]fluspidine in humans was underestimated by preclinical imaging which needs to be considered in other first-in-human studies.

However, another report indicated that [C-11]MP-10 displayed seemingly irreversible kinetics in rhesus monkeys, potentially due to the presence of a radiolabeled metabolite capable of penetrating the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) into the brain. This study was designed to address the discrepancies between the species by re-evaluating [C-11]MP-10 in vivo in rhesus monkey with baseline scans to assess tissue uptake kinetics and self-blocking scans with unlabeled MP-10 to determine binding specificity. Ex vivo studies with one rhesus monkey and 4 Sprague-Dawley rats were also performed to investigate the presence of radiolabeled metabolites in the brain. Our results indicated that [C-11]MP-10 displayed reversible uptake kinetics in rhesus monkeys, albeit slower than in baboons. Administration of unlabeled MP-10 reduced the binding of [C-11]MP-10 in a dose-dependent manner in all brain regions including the cerebellum. Consequently, the cerebellum appeared not to be a suitable reference tissue in rhesus monkeys. Regional volume of distribution (V-T) was mostly reliably derived with the multilinear analysis (MA1) method. In ex vivo studies in the monkey and rats only negligible amount of radiometabolites was seen in the brain of either species. In summary, results from the present study strongly support the suitability of [C-11]MP-10 as a radiotracer for PET imaging and quantification of PDE10A in nonhuman primates. Synapse 69:86-95, 2015.

To facilitate the mechanistic understanding of allosteric modulation of CXCR3, we combined computational modeling with the synthesis of novel chemical tools containing boronic acid moiety, site-directed mutagenesis, and detailed functional characterization. The design of boronic acid derivatives was based on the predictions from homology modeling and docking. The choice of the boronic acid moiety was dictated by its unique ability to interact with proteins in a reversible covalent way, thereby influencing conformational dynamics of target biomolecules. During the synthesis of the library we have developed a novel approach for the purification of drug-like boronic acids. To validate the predicted binding mode and to identify amino acid residues responsible for the transduction of signal through CXCR3, we conducted a site-directed mutagenesis study. With the use of allosteric radioligand RAMX3 we were able to establish the existence of a second allosteric binding pocket in CXCR3, which enables different binding modes of structurally closely related allosteric modulators of CXCR3. We have also identified residues Trp109(2.60) and Lys300(7.35) inside the transmembrane bundle of the receptor as crucial for the regulation of the G protein activation. Furthermore, we report the boronic acid 14 as the first biased negative allosteric modulator of the receptor. Overall, our data demonstrate that boronic acid derivatives represent an outstanding tool for determination of key receptorligand interactions and induction of ligand-biased signaling.

Proteolytic digestion with trypsin and V8 protease, together with MS/MS de novo sequencing, indicated that the mature toxin has an amidated C-terminal arginine, a posttranslational modification rarely observed for snake TFTs. alpha-EPTX-Dpp2d was found to potently inhibit alpha 7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR; IC50, 58 +/- 24 nM) and muscle-type nAChR (IC50, 114 +/- 37 nM) but did not affect alpha 3 beta 2 and alpha 3 beta 4 nAChR isoforms at 1 mu M concentrations. Competitive radioligand binding assays demonstrated that alpha-EPTX-Dpp2d competes with epibatidine binding to the Lymnea stagnalis acetylcholine-binding protein (Ls-AChBP; IC50, 4.9 +/- 2.3 nM). The activity profile and binding data are reminiscent of classical long-chain TFTs with a free carboxyl termini, suggesting that amidation does not significantly affect toxin selectivity. The crystal structure of alpha-EPTX-Dpp2d was determined at 1.7 angstrom resolution and displayed a dimeric toxin assembly with each monomer positioned in an antiparallel orientation. The dimeric structure is stabilized by extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, which raised the possibility that the toxin may exist as a noncovalent homodimer in solution. However, chemical cross-linking and size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS) data indicated that the toxin is predominantly monomeric under physiological conditions. Because of its high potency and selectivity, we expect this toxin to be a valuable pharmacological tool for studying the structure and function of nAChRs.

Spatial Reorganization of Putaminal Dopamine D<sub>2</sub>-Like Receptors in Cranial and Hand Dystonia	PLOS ONE			English	Article							POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; STEADY-STATE MEASUREMENT; BASAL GANGLIA; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; RESPONSIVE DYSTONIA; TEMPLATE IMAGES; FOCAL DYSTONIA; DYT1 DYSTONIA; BINDING; D2	The putamen has a somatotopic organization of neurons identified by correspondence of firing rates with selected body part movements, as well as by complex, but organized, differential cortical projections onto putamen. In isolated focal dystonia, whole putaminal binding of dopamine D-2-like receptor radioligands is quantitatively decreased, but it has not been known whether selected parts of the putamen are differentially affected depending upon the body part affected by dystonia. The radioligand [F-18] spiperone binds predominantly to D-2-like receptors in striatum. We hypothesized that the spatial location of [F-18] spiperone binding within the putamen would differ in patients with dystonia limited to the hand versus the face, and we tested that hypothesis using positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. To address statistical and methodological concerns, we chose a straightforward but robust image analysis method. An automated algorithm located the peak location of [F-18] spiperone binding within the striatum, relative to a brain atlas, in each of 14 patients with cranial dystonia and 8 patients with hand dystonia. The mean (left and right) |x|, y, and z coordinates of peak striatal binding for each patient were compared between groups by t test. The location of peak [F-18] spiperone binding within the putamen differed significantly between groups (cranial dystonia z<hand dystonia z, p = 0.016). We conclude that in isolated focal dystonia, dopamine D-2-like receptors are distributed differently in the putamen depending on the body part manifesting dystonia.

(-)-[<SUP>18</SUP>F]Flubatine: evaluation in rhesus monkeys and a report of the f irst fully automated radiosynthesis validated for clinical use	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; norchloro-fluoro-homoepibatidine; (-)-[F-18]NCFHEB; positron emission tomography (PET) imaging	NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; IN-VIVO MEASUREMENT; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PET; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND	(-)-[F-18]Flubatine was selected for clinical imaging of (42) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors because of its high affinity and appropriate kinetic profile. A fully automated synthesis of (-)-[F-18]flubatine as a sterile isotonic solution suitable for clinical use is reported, as well as the first evaluation in nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques). (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared by fluorination of the Boc-protected trimethylammonium iodide precursor with [F-18]fluoride in an automated synthesis module. Subsequent deprotection of the Boc group with 1-M HCl yielded (-)-[F-18]flubatine, which was purified by semi-preparative HPLC. (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared in 25% radiochemical yield (formulated for clinical use at end of synthesis, n=3), >95% radiochemical purity, and specific activity=4647Ci/mmol (171.9GBq/mu mol). Doses met all quality control criteria confirming their suitability for clinical use. Evaluation of (-)-[F-18]flubatine in rhesus macaques was performed with a Concorde MicroPET P4 scanner (Concorde MicroSystems, Knoxville, TN). The brain was imaged for 90min, and data were reconstructed using the 3-D maximum a posteriori algorithm. Image analysis revealed higher uptake and slower washout in the thalamus than those in other areas of the brain and peak uptake at 45min. Injection of 2.5 mu g/kg of nifene at 60min initiated a slow washout of [F-18]flubatine, with about 25% clearance from the thalamus by the end of imaging at 90min.

Naturally Occurring Eccentric Cleavage Products of Provitamin A β-Carotene Function as Antagonists of Retinoic Acid Receptors	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTOR; VITAMIN-A; IN-VIVO; LUNG-CANCER; CONVERSION; BETA-APO-13-CAROTENONE; EXPRESSION; FERRETS; ALPHA; CELLS	beta-Carotene is the major dietary source of provitamin A. Central cleavage of beta-carotene catalyzed by beta-carotene oxygenase 1 yields two molecules of retinaldehyde. Subsequent oxidation produces all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which functions as a ligand for a family of nuclear transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Eccentric cleavage of beta-carotene at non-central double bonds is catalyzed by other enzymes and can also occur non-enzymatically. The products of these reactions are beta-apocarotenals and beta-apocarotenones, whose biological functions in mammals are unknown. We used reporter gene assays to show that none of the beta-apocarotenoids significantly activated RARs. Importantly, however, beta-apo-14'-carotenal, beta-apo-14'-carotenoic acid, and beta-apo-13-carotenone antagonized ATRA-induced transactivation of RARs. Competitive radioligand binding assays demonstrated that these putative RAR antagonists compete directly with retinoic acid for high affinity binding to purified receptors. Molecular modeling studies confirmed that beta-apo-13-carotenone can interact directly with the ligand binding site of the retinoid receptors. beta-Apo-13-carotenone and the beta-apo-14'-carotenoids inhibited ATRA-induced expression of retinoid responsive genes in Hep G2 cells. Finally, we developed an LC/MS method and found 3-5 nM beta-apo-13-carotenone was present in human plasma. These findings suggest that beta-apocarotenoids function as naturally occurring retinoid antagonists. The antagonism of retinoid signaling by these metabolites may have implications for the activities of dietary beta-carotene as a provitamin A and as a modulator of risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer.

Pharmacological characterization of MK-6096-A dual orexin receptor antagonist for insomnia	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Orexin; Hypocretin; Insomnia; Receptor occupancy; Pharmacology; MK-6096	SLEEP; NARCOLEPSY; NEURONS; DISCOVERY; SYSTEM; POTENT; MICE; HYPOCRETINS; EXPRESSION; PROMOTION	Orexin (hypocretin) neuropeptides promote wakefulness by signaling through two G-protein coupled receptors, Orexin 1 Receptor (OX1R) and Orexin 2 Receptor (OX2R). MK-6096 is an orally bioavailable potent and selective reversible antagonist of OX1R and OX2R currently in clinical development for insomnia. In radioligand binding and functional cell based assays MK-6096 demonstrated potent binding and antagonism of both human OX1R and OX2R (<3 nM in binding, 11 nM in FLIPR), with no significant off-target activities against a panel of >170 receptors and enzymes. MK-6096 occupies 90% of human OX(2)Rs expressed in transgenic rats at a plasma concentration of 142 nM, and dose-dependently reduced locomotor activity and significantly increased sleep in rats (3-30 mg/kg) and dogs (0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg). DORA-22, an analog of MK-6096, exhibits similar sleep promoting properties that are absent OX1/2R double knockouts, demonstrating the mechanism of action and specificity of these effects. These findings with a novel, structurally distinct class of OxR antagonists provide further validation of the orexin pathway as an effective target to promote normal sleep. Comparative analysis of the biochemical and pharmacokinetic properties of these compounds relative to other OXR antagonists provides a basis for understanding the attributes critical for in vivo efficacy. This mechanism is distinct from current standard of care such that MK-6096 represents a novel and selective therapeutic for the treatment of insomnia.

Increased expression of 5-HT<sub>6</sub> receptors in dorsolateral striatum decreases habitual lever pressing, but does not affect learning acquisition of simple operant tasks in rats	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						habitual responding; learning acquisition; serotonin; viral-mediated gene transfer	DORSOMEDIAL STRIATUM; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; BASAL GANGLIA; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; INHIBITION; DOPAMINE; SYSTEMS; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE-6	Serotonin-6 (5-HT6) receptors are densely expressed in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), a brain region linked to habits. Medications acting on the serotonergic system, including 5-HT6 receptors, can diminish habitual and repetitive behaviors associated with clinical syndromes such as obsessive-compulsive disorder, and may have implications for addiction as well. To examine the role of 5-HT6 receptors in the acquisition and persistence of habitual behavior, we manipulated 5-HT6 receptor expression in the DLS with herpes simplex virus vectors in combination with different behavioral procedures; control rats received a vector expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. In one set of experiments, rats were tested under conditions that favor the acquisition of either discrete action-outcome responding or repetitive responding; increased 5-HT6 receptor expression in DLS did not alter learning in either paradigm. In the next experiment, rats were over-trained on fixed-then variable-interval schedules, resulting in an escalation of lever pressing over sessions far in excess of that necessary to receive sucrose pellets. After training, rats received viral vector infusion into the DLS. Subsequently, half of each group underwent an omission contingency training session in which they received reinforcement for refraining from pressing the lever, while the other half served as yoked controls. A probe session under extinction conditions was performed the following day. Only rats that received both the 5-HT6 vector and omission contingency training showed reduced lever pressing during the probe session. These results suggest that increasing 5-HT6 receptor signaling in the DLS facilitates behavioral flexibility in the face of changing contingencies.

Methods [C-11]GF120918 was synthesized by reacting the desmethyl precursor with [C-11]CH3I. An in-vitro study using [C-11]GF120918 was carried out in Caco-2 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells in the presence or absence of a transporter inhibitor (cyclosporine A and unlabeled GF120918). The biodistribution of radioactivity after the injection of [C-11]GF120918 was determined in Caco-2-bearing mice using a small animal PET scanner. Results In Caco-2 cells expressing Pgp and BCRP, coincubation with unlabeled GF120918 caused an approximately two-fold increase in [C-11]GF120918 uptake compared with that of the control ([C-11]GF120918 only). In Caco-2-bearing mice, PET results indicated that [C-11]GF120918 uptake in the tumor was low, but was significantly increased by treatment with unlabeled GF120918. In metabolite analysis, the radioactive component in the tumor almost corresponded to intact [C-11] GF120918. Conclusion A PET study combining the administration of [C-11] GF120918 with unlabeled GF120918 may be a useful tool for evaluating the functions of Pgp and BCRP in tumors.

Influence of β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor gene polymorphisms on β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor expression in human lung	PULMONARY PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						Asthma; Human lung; ADRB2; beta(2)-adrenoceptor; SNP	AIRWAY SMOOTH-MUSCLE; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; ADENOSINE-MONOPHOSPHATE; PARTIAL AGONISTS; MAST-CELLS; LEADER CISTRON; ASTHMA; DESENSITIZATION; PROMOTER; HAPLOTYPES	Background: The aim of the present study was to establish whether polymorphisms, especially those within the promoter region, of the beta(2)-adrenoceptor gene (ADRB2) influence beta(2)-adrenoceptor expression in human lung. Methods: The density of beta-adrenoceptors in human lung tissue (n = 88) was determined by saturation binding using the radioligand, iodinated cyanopindolol. Discrimination of beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors was determined using the highly selective (beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist, CGP20712A. Genotype was determined at 5 positions of ADRB2 previously reported as polymorphic. Potential influences of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the promoter region (-367, -47) and coding block (46, 79, 491) of ADRB2 on beta(2)-adrenoceptor expression were investigated. Results: The density of beta(2)-adrenoceptors was variable among the 88 lung preparations studied ranging from 17 to 177 fmol/mg protein (mean +/- S.E.M., 72 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein). There was no influence of genotype on beta(2)-adrenoceptor expression for any of the polymorphisms studied except at position 491. The polymorphism at position 491C > T, leading to a change from thr to ile at amino acid 164, is uncommon. Preparations genotyped as heterozygous (126 +/- 15 fmol/mg protein; n = 5) expressed significantly (P = 0.0005) higher levels of beta(2)-adrenoceptor than those that were homozygous (69 +/- 4 fmol/mg protein; n = 83). Conclusion: With the exception of position 491, these data indicate that polymorphisms of ADRB2 do not influence beta(2)-adrenoceptor expression in human lung.

Among other approaches, low-throughput electrophysiological assays in Xenopus oocytes and two channel application "liquid filament" systems for mammalian cells have been commonly used. More recent technical innovations that have been introduced into the field of electrophysiology allow for automated simultaneous multi-channel operation. Here we report the development and optimization of a high-throughput electrophysiological assay for identifying functionally active alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic receptor ligands using such a system. Characterization of the test system yielded results comparable to those obtained by other investigators using conventional electrophysiological assays. For example, the concentration-response relationships obtained for alpha 4 beta 2 receptor activation by acetylcholine and nicotine were best described by biphasic Hill equations, and the inhibition of alpha 4 beta 2 receptor currents by the nicotinic antagonist dihydro-beta-erythroidine was consistent with previously published results. Functional up-regulation of alpha 4 beta 2 receptors by prolonged exposure to nicotine or lower temperature was also confirmed. Using this methodology we were able to characterize the activation of alpha 4 beta 2 receptors by multiple compounds in a mammalian cell expression system, exemplifying its utility for rapid identification of novel nicotinic ligands within a screening cascade. Our results demonstrate the utility of this electrophysiological tool for the discovery of alpha 4 beta 2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligands with potential applications in numerous clinical indications.

New 2α-tropane amides as potential PET ligands for the dopamine transporter	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						DAT ligands; PET; cocaine derivatives; 2 alpha,3 beta tropanes	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; OMEGA-FLUOROALKYL ANALOGS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; HIGH-AFFINITY; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; COCAINE ANALOGS; BETA-CIT; BINDING; DERIVATIVES; INHIBITION	Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of dopamine transporter (DAT) density in the brain is a potentially valuable tool for studying the etiopathology of degenerative brain disorders. The present study evaluated five new potential competitive inhibitors of DAT as ligands for PET. The evaluation of the new compounds measured their ability to compete with the binding of the reference ligand 2 beta carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-[I-131]iodophenyl)tropane [I-131]beta-CIT to striatal and cortical membranes from rat and pig brain. Four of the new compounds structurally related to cocaine were synthesized in their 2 alpha,3 beta configuration; the most potent one, 3 beta(4-iodo-phenyl)-8-methyl-8-aza- bicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2 alpha-carboxylic acid (2-fluoro-ethyl)-amide, was synthesized also in the 2 beta,3 beta configuration. For comparative studies in rat brain and new evaluation in pig brain homogenate, the established compounds beta-CIT, FP-CIT, PE2I and FETT were also synthesized and evaluated. Contrary to expectation, the 2 alpha,3 beta and 2 alpha,3 beta isomers of 3-(4-iodo-phenyl)-8-methyl-8-aza-bicyclo[3.2. 1]octane-2-carboxylic acid (2-fluoro-ethyl)-amide showed the same affinity constant for rat striaturn (K-i=200 nM +/- 34), but in pig striaturn and rat and pig cortex the 2a,3 beta form even had a higher affinity than the 2 alpha,3 beta form.

However, many mechanistic details underlying 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptor cross-talk have not been elucidated. We hypothesized that 5-HT2B and 5-HT1B receptors each affect the others' signaling by modulating the others' trafficking. We thus examined the agonist stimulated internalization kinetics of fluorescent protein-tagged 5-HT2B and 5-HT1B receptors when expressed alone and upon coexpression in LMTK -murine fibroblasts. Time-lapse confocal microscopy and wholecell radioligand binding analyses revealed that, when expressed alone, 5-HT2B and 5-HT1B receptors displayed distinct half-lives. Upon coexpression, serotonin-induced internalization of 5-HT 2B receptors was accelerated 5-fold and was insensitive to a 5-HT2B receptor antagonist. In this context, 5-HT2B receptors did internalize in response to a 5-HT1B receptor agonist. In contrast, coexpression did not render 5-HT (1B) receptor internalization sensitive to a 5-HT (2B) receptor agonist. The altered internalization kinetics of both receptors upon coexpression was probably not due to direct interaction because only low levels of colocalization were observed. Antibody knockdown experiments revealed that internalization of 5-HT1B receptors (expressed alone) was entirely clathrinin-dependent and Caveolin1-dependent, whereas that of 5-HT2B receptors (expressed alone) was Caveolin1-independent and clathrin-dependent. Upon coexpression, serotonin-induced 5-HT2B receptor internalization became partially Caveolin1-dependent, and serotonin-induced 5-HT1B receptor internalization became entirely Caveolin1-independent in a protein kinase C epsilon-dependent fashion. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that coexpression of 5-HT1B and 5-HT2B receptors influences the internalization pathways and kinetics of both receptors.

Nucleus accumbens NMDA receptor subunit expression and function is enhanced in morphine-dependent rats	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						NMDA; NR2A; MK-801; morphine; dopamine; behaviour	MESSENGER-RNA; BRAIN-REGIONS; WITHDRAWAL; TOLERANCE; MK-801; OPIATE; MICE; INHIBITION; ANTAGONIST; BEHAVIORS	We have previously shown, using radioligand binding studies, that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) NR1 and NR2A receptor subunits density was decreased in the forebrain of morphine-dependent rats. We have now determined if morphine-dependent rats display regional differences in NMDA receptor expression and whether such changes are functionally relevant. In morphine-dependent rats, the expression of NR1 and NR2A subunits protein, as determined by Western blotting with NMDA receptor subunit antibodies, were decreased in frontal cortex and hippocampus but significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens. The expression of the NR2B subunit was unchanged in all regions examined. In separate groups of morphine-dependent rats, MK-801-induced hyperactivity (thought to be mediated via modulation of nucleus accumbens dopamine release) was significantly enhanced in morphine-dependent animals. Similarly, the MK-801-induced increase of dopamine metabolism was significantly increased in the nucleus accumbens of morphine-dependent animals as compared to sham controls. Results provide both biochemical and behavioural evidence to suggest that NMDA receptor function in the nucleus accumbens, at least with respect to an interaction with the limbic dopamine system, is markedly enhanced in morphine-dependent rats. This increase in function may be associated with an enhanced expression of NMDA receptors, particularly those in the nucleus accumbens containing the NR2A subunit. Taken together, these data support several studies in the literature indicating that NMDA receptors in the nucleus accumbens are involved in the process of opiate dependence.

The purpose of this study was to compare a range of disintegrins with different integrin selectivities for their binding behavior in vitro to vascular endothelial cells bearing alpha v beta 3 and to cultured tumor cells which express alpha v beta 3. Methods: Five disintegrins (bitistatin, kistrin, flavoridin, VLO4 and echistatin) and a cyclic pentapeptide, c[RGDyK], were radiolabeled with Tc-99m and tested for binding to cells in vitro. Results: Tc-99m-Kistrin, flavoridin and VLO4 had the highest binding, Tc-99m-echistatin had moderate binding, and Tc-99m bitistatin and (99m)Tec[RGDyK] had low binding to cells. The observed binding was attributed to alpha v beta 3 to various extents: echistatin, bitistatin>kistrin>flavoridm>VLO4. Cancer cells internalized bound disintegrins after binding, but endothelial cells did not. After binding to endothelial cells, Tc-99m-kistrin was not displaced by competing peptide or plasma proteins. Conclusions: These data suggest that radiolabeled kistrin, flavoridin and VLO4 may have advantages over labeled bitistatin and small cyclic peptides for targeting alpha v beta 3 in vivo. Since receptor-bound radioligand is not internalized by endothelial cells, disintegrin may provide an advantage for targeting alpha v beta 3 on vasculature because they bind strongly to surface receptors and are not readily displaced.

Regional distribution of sodium-dependent excitatory amino acid transporters in rat spinal cord	JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	American-Spinal-Injury-Association/45th Annual Meeting of the International-Spinal-Cord-Society	JUN 27, 2006	Boston, MA	Amer Spinal Injury Assoc, Int Spinal Cord Soc		spinal cord; glutamate plasma membrane proteins; autoradiography; immunohistochernistry; amino acid transporters; excitatory	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; QUANTITATIVE AUTORADIOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; CELL-SURFACE EXPRESSION; IN-SITU HYBRIDIZATION; MOTOR-NEURON DISEASE; GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTER; BINDING-SITES; HIGH-AFFINITY; COMPARATIVE IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY	Background/Objective: The excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs), or sodium-dependent glutamate transporters, provide the primary mechanism for glutamate removal from the synaptic cleft. EAAT distribution has been determined in the rat brain, but it is only partially characterized in the spinal cord. Methods: The regional anatomic distribution of EAATs in spinal cord was assessed by radioligand autoradiography throughout cervical, thoracic, and lumbar cord levels in female Sprague-Dawley rats. EAAT subtype regional distribution was evaluated by inclusion of pharmacologic transport inhibitors in the autoradiography assays and by immunohistochemistry using subtype-specific polyclonal antibodies to rat GLT1 (EAAT2), GLAST (EAAT1), and EAAC1 (EAAT3) rat transporter subtypes. Results: [H-3]-D-Aspartate binding was distributed throughout gray matter at the 3 spinal cord levels, with negligible binding in white matter. Inclusion of pharmacologic transport inhibitors indicates that the EAAT2/GLT1 subtype represents 21% to 40% of binding. Both EAAT1 /GLAST and EAAT3/EAAC1 contributed the remainder of binding. Immunoreactivity to subtype-specific antibodies varied, depending on cord level, and was present in both gray and white matter. All 3 subtypes displayed prominent immunoreactivity in the dorsal horn. EAAT3/EAAC1 and to a lesser extent EAAT1/GLAST immunoreactivity also occurred in a punctate pattern in the ventral horn. Conclusions: The results indicate heterogeneity of EAAT distribution among spinal cord levels and regions. The presence of these transporters throughout rat spinal cord suggests the importance of their contributions to spinal cord function.

Biological activity was determined by examining the capacity of the toxins to competitively inhibit the binding of radiolabelled bungarotoxin to acetylcholine receptors, using post-synaptic membrane fractions of Torpedo electric tissue. Inhibition was concentration dependent, with a K-i of 5(.)4 +/- 1(.)1 x 10(-8) M for anatoxin-a and 7(.)4 +/- 0(.)9 x 10(-8) M for homoanatoxin-a. Their high affinities for the nicotinic cholinergic receptors were exploited to adapt the radioligand-binding assay for routine detection of this class of neurotoxins directly in low-molecular-mass cell extracts of cyanobacteria. Confirmation of the results and toxin identification were achieved by coupled gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Seventy-six axenic strains, representative of 13 genera, were analysed. Five strains of the genus Oscillatoria, hitherto unknown for their toxicity, inhibited bungarotoxin binding. GC/MS revealed that Oscillatoria sp. strains PCC 6407, PCC 6412 and PCC 9107 synthesized exclusively anatoxin-a, whereas both anatoxin-a and homoanatoxin-a were produced by strain PCC 9029. Oscillatoria sp. strain PCC 6506, an isolate co-identic with strain PCC 9029, also produced both neurotoxins, but their respective presence depended upon growth conditions. The latter results suggest that regulatory differences in at least some of the cyanobacterial strains may account for the preferential synthesis of only one of the two neurotoxins or for their simultaneous occurrence.

Here, we examined the in vivo binding characteristics of the D-2-like receptor antagonist [H-3]nemonapride in rat brain areas including the striatum, olfactory lobes and frontal cortex and its inhibition by a series of D-2 antagonist antipsychotics. In vivo affinity of [H-3]nemonapride was similar (apparent K-d value: 0.05 mu mol/kg) in all brain regions examined. The estimated number of binding sites was higher in the striatum (66 fmol/mg wet weight) than in the olfactory lobes (28 fmol/mg wet weight) and the frontal cortex (21 fmol/ mg wet weight). In the striatum, [H-3]nemonapride binding was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with the following order of potency (ED50, mg/kg): nemonapride (0.04), raclopride (0.13), spiperone and risperidone (0.14), haloperidol (0.21), clozapine (7.2) and thioridazine (9.4); in the olfactory lobes: nemonapride (0.03), raclopride and spiperone (0.09), haloperidol (0.10), risperidone (0,15), thioridazine and clozapine (11); in the frontal cortex, only the high affinity dopamine D-2 antagonist compounds nemonapride (0.05), haloperidol (0.09), and raclopride (0.12) significantly decreased the binding of [H-3]nemonapride. The present data suggest that conventional and atypical antipsychotics may be distinguished by their differential occupancy of striatal versus fronto-cortical D-2-like receptors in vivo.

To obtain a quantitative measure of how well this pocket is preserved in a mutated form of the receptor, in which His-297 is substituted with glutamine, we employed [H-3]-beta-FNA to evaluate the kinetic rate constants for both the reversible as well as the irreversible stages of its binding to wild-type and mutant H297Q mu receptors stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. The expression levels of the wild-type and mutant H297Q receptors were matched by exploiting the variation in receptor density as a function of plating day and by raising the expression level by pretreatment with naloxone. We found that all of the kinetic rate constants for [H-3]-beta-FNA were diminished by about one-half at the mutant H297Q mu receptors with respect to wild-type receptors. By comparison, the association rate constant of [H-3]-naloxone likewise decreased by one-half, however, the dissociation rate constant increased 5-fold at the mutant H297Q receptor. We conclude that the mutation has had only minor influence on the recognition site and that the function of position 297 is more likely as a link in the transduction chain.

We found high mGlul receptor binding in the cerebellum, thalamus, dentate gyrus and medial central gray, moderate binding within the CA3 of the hippocampus and hypothalamus, and low mGlul receptor binding in the basal ganglia and cortex. The mGlu1 receptor is also present in variable degree in the dorsal lateral septal nucleus, amygdala, interpeduncular nucleus and median raphe nucleus. Additionally, we employed [H-3]R214127 autoradiography as a means of investigating the Occupancy of central mGlu1 receptors following in vivo administration of mGlu1 receptor antagonists that prevent binding of this radioligand. We found that the mGlu1 receptor antagonist (3aS,6aS)-6a-naphtalan-2-ylmethyl-5-methyliden-hexahydro-cyclopenta[c]furan-1-on (BAY 36-7620), administered subcutaneously (s.c.) at 10 mg/kg, only occupied about 30%) of cerebellar and thalamic mGlu1 receptors. The mGlul/5 receptor antagonist 2-quinoxaline-carboxamide-N-adamantan-1-yl (NPS 2390) exhibited it relatively high potency in Occupying MGlu1 receptors in rat cerebellum (ED50 = 0.75 mg/kg, s.c.) and thalamus (ED50 = 0.63 mg/kg, s.c). In the future, this method can be employed to gain more insight into the in vivo profile and central activity of potential therapeutic agents that act upon the mGlul receptor. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide ( PACAP) is also a potent agonist of VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptors as well as of a third, PACAP-specific receptor (PAC(1)). We report here the distribution of the VPAC(2) receptor in peripheral tissues of the mouse, determined by receptor autoradiography using [I-125] VIP and the selective VPAC(2) receptor agonist [I-125] Ro25-1553 in wild-type and VPAC(2) receptor-null mice. In addition, displacement experiments with the VPAC(2)-selective agonist Ro25-1553 and the VPAC(1)-selective agonist [K-15, R-16, L-27] VIP(1 - 7)/GRF(8 - 27) were performed using the universal radioligand [I-125] VIP. The VPAC(2) receptor is found predominantly in smooth muscle (in blood vessels and in the smooth muscle layers of the gastrointestinal and reproductive systems), the basal part of the mucosal epithelium in the colon, lung, the vasculature of the kidney, adrenal medulla, and retina. Unexpectedly, the receptor was also present in thyroid follicular cells and acinar cells of the pancreas, tissues that have not been found to express the receptor in other species, and in very large amounts in the lung. Our data suggest novel functions of the VPAC(2) receptor and additional potential therapeutic uses of drugs acting at the receptor ( including the treatment of erectile dysfunction), but our results also indicate that caution should be exercised in using the mouse as an animal model for the evaluation of VIP analogs intended for diagnostic or therapeutic use in man.

ET-1 induced significantly larger contractile responses in bladder dome muscle strips from 3-week-than from 3-month- and 22-month-old rats. The expression level of total ET receptors, determined by saturation binding experiments with [I-125]ET-1, was higher in detrusor from 3-week- than 22-month-old rats. Inhibition studies with BQ123, a selective ETA receptor antagonist, indicated the predominance of the ETA receptor subtype and a similar proportion of ETA to ETB receptor subtypes in the rat detrusor at all ages studied. Autoradiographic data support the age-dependent decrease in the density of ET receptors and also indicate that the ETA receptor subtype is primarily located in the smooth muscle layer, whereas the ETB receptor subtype is located in both the urothelial and smooth muscle layers. Determined by real-time RT-PCR, ET 1, ET-3, ECE-1 and ET receptor subtype (ETA and ETB) mRNAs were shown to be higher in bladders of 3-week- compared to 3-month- or 22-month-old rats. This study indicates age-dependent alterations in the ET receptor system at both gene transcript and protein levels in the Fischer rat detrusor.

In the present study, we investigate the distribution of the adenosine A, receptor in the rat spinal cord dorsal horn using immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, radioligand binding, and confocal microscopy. In the lumbar cord dorsal horn, dense immunoreactivity was seen in the inner part of lamina II. This was unaltered by dorsal root section or thoracic cord hemisection. Confocal microscopy of the dorsal horn revealed close anatomical relationships but no or only minor overlap between A, receptors and immunoreactivity for markers associated with primary afferent central endings: calcitonin gene-related peptide, or isolectin B4, or with neuronal subpopulations: mu-opioid receptor, neuronal nitric oxide synthase, met-enkephalin, parvalbumin, or protein kinase Cgamma, or with glial cells: glial fibrillary acidic protein. A few adenosine A, receptor positive structures were double-labeled with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoaxolepropionic acid glutamate receptor subunits 1 and 2/3. The results indicate that most of the adenosine A, receptors in the dorsal horn are located in inner lamina 11 postsynaptic neuronal cell bodies and processes whose functional and neurochemical identity is so far unknown.

J	Lundell, I; Boswell, T; Larhammar, D				Lundell, I; Boswell, T; Larhammar, D			Chicken neuropeptide Y-family receptor Y4: a receptor with equal affinity for pancreatic polypeptide, neuropeptide Y and peptide YY	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							EXPRESSION CLONING; ANCESTRAL GENE; MESSENGER-RNA; NPY RECEPTORS; GOLDFISH; SUBTYPE; BRAIN; RAT; PIG; RADIOLIGAND	Within the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family of peptides, pancreatic polypeptide is the most divergent across species. It differs in 20 of 36 positions between human and chicken. In mammals, it binds primarily to the Y4 receptor, to which NPY and peptide YY (PYY) bind with lower affinities. Because of these large sequence differences in pancreatic polypeptide, we decided to characterise the chicken Y4 receptor. We report here that Y4 displays the least sequence conservation among the Y-family receptors, with only 57-60% overall amino acid identity between chicken and mammals, compared with 64-83% for the Y1, Y2 and Y5 receptors. After expression of the chicken Y4 receptor in COS-7 cells, I-125-labelled porcine (p) PYY bound with a K-d of 20 pM. In competition with I-125-pPYY, chicken pancreatic polypeptide bound with high affinity at 140 pM. Interestingly, chicken PYY bound with even greater affinity at 68 pM. The affinity of NPY, 160 pM, was similar to that of pancreatic polypeptide. Chicken Y4 is less sensitive than is mammalian Y4 to truncation of the amino terminus of the NPY molecule. RT-PCR revealed expression in several peripheral organs, including adipose tissue and oviduct. In brain, Y4 mRNA was detected in the brainstem, cerebellum and hippocampus. In situ hybridisation to brain sections showed expression in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in the brainstem. Thus the chicken Y4 receptor is less selective and anatomically more widespread than that in mammals, probably reflecting the original properties of the Y4 receptor.

J	Nilvebrant, L				Nilvebrant, L			Tolterodine and its active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite: Pure muscarinic receptor antagonists	PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							URINARY-BLADDER; CALCIUM-ANTAGONISTS; OVERACTIVE BLADDER; ANTIMUSCARINIC AGENT; DETRUSOR INSTABILITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OXYBUTYNIN; RAT; BINDING; EFFICACY	Tolterodine and its major active 5-hydroxymethyl metabolite (5-HM) are potent muscarinic receptor antagonists that show selectivity for the urinary bladder over salivary glands in vivo. This tissue selectivity cannot be attributed to muscarinic receptor subtype selectivity, since both compounds are non-selective with respect to the M-1-M-5 receptor subtypes. The aim of the present in vitro study was to determine the specificity of tolterodine and 5-HM for muscarinic receptors compared to other potential cellular targets. Carbachol-induced contractions of isolated guinea pig bladder were effectively inhibited by tolterodine (IC50 14 nM) and 5-HM (IC50 5.7 nM). Tolterodine and 5-HM were weak inhibitors of effects mediated by alpha-adrenergic receptors (rat portal vein), histamine receptors (guinea pig ileum) and calcium channels (guinea pig potassium-depolarised urinary bladder, spontaneously beating right atria and electrically-driven right papillary muscle). The IC50 values were in the muM range and the antimuscarinic potency of tolterodine was 27, 200 and 370485 times higher, respectively, than its potency in blocking histamine receptors, alpha-adrenoceptors and calcium channels, The active metabolite, 5-HM, was >900 times less potent at these sites than at bladder muscarinic receptors. Radioligand binding data on 54 different receptors and binding sites showed that tolterodine and 5-HM bind with significant affinity only at muscarinic receptors. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that both tolterodine and 5-HM are specific muscarinic receptor antagonists. The tissue selectivity of these agents in vivo cannot therefore be explained by secondary pharmacological actions.

In view of the favorable physical characteristics of the Ga isotopes Ga-67 and Ga-68 enabling conventional tumor scintigraphy, PET and possibly internal radiotherapy, we focused on the development of a Ga-labeled somatostatin analog suitable for targeting SSTR-expressing tumors. For this purpose, 3 somatostatin analogs, OC, TOC and TATE were conjugated to the metal chelator DOTA and labeled with the radiometals In-111, Y-90 and Ga-67. They were then evaluated for their performance in the AR4-2J pancreatic tumor model by testing SSTR2-binding affinity, internalization/externalization in isolated cells and biodistribution in tumor-bearing nude mice. Surprisingly, we found that, compared to (111) In or Y-90 labeling with Ga-67 considerably improved the biologic performance of the tested somatostatin analogs with respect to SSTR2 affinity and tissue distribution. Ga-67-labeled DOTA-somatostatin analogs were rapidly excreted from nontarget tissues, leading to excellent tumor-to-nontarget tissue uptake ratios. Of interest for radiotherapeutic application [Ga-67]DOTATOC was strongly internalized by AR4-2J cells. Furthermore, our results suggest a link between the radioligand charge and its kidney retention. The excellent tumor selectivity of Ga-DOTA somatostatin analogs together with the different applications of Ga in nuclear oncology suggests that Ga-DOTA somatostatin analogs will become an important tool in the management of SSTR-positive tumors.

Iridal melanocytes were isolated and cultured with medium supplemented with cAMP elevating agents and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (complete medium). The iridal melanocytes were plated into multiple well plates and cultured with complete medium or various deleted media with or without various prostanoids at different concentrations. After 6 days. the numbers of eels and dendrites were counted and melanin content was measured and compared with controls. Prostaglandin E-2, an EP2 receptor agonist (AH 13205) and AGN 192093 (thromboxane mimetic) stimulated growth. melanogenesis and dendrification of cultured iridal melanocytes in cAMP-deleted medium. A mixed EP1 and EP3 receptor agonist (sulprostone), a EP4 receptor agonist (ONO-AE1-329), IP receptor agonists (cicaprost or iloprost) and a TP receptor agonist (U-46619) showed no effect. Prostaglandin D-2 showed stimulating effects. However, these stimulating effects could not be blocked by the addition of a DP receptor antagonist (BW A868C). Furthermore, a DP receptor agonist (BW 245C) showed no effects, indicating that the effect of prostaglandin D-2 may involve receptors other than the DP receptor subtype. The present study indicates that: (1) among various EP receptor agonists, only an EP2 receptor agonist has stimulating effects on iridal melanocytes; (2) DP, IP and TP receptor agonists do not have stimulating effects: and (3) the mechanisms of action of prostaglandin D-2 and AGN 192093 need further study.

The structure of the allosteric binding domain(s) and the features of agonists, antagonists and modulators which determine the occurrence of either positive or negative cooperativity require clarification. We tested interactions between allosteric, modulators alcuronium, strychnine and brucine and eight antagonists at muscarinic receptors expressed in CHO cells. In experiments with unlabeled antagonists, all three modulators enhanced the affinity for 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-dimethylpiperidinium (4-DAMP) at the M-2 receptors, and strychnine did so also at the M-4 receptors. Positive interactions were also observed between alcuronium and L-hyoscyamine (M-2) and scopolamine (M-2), between strychnine and butylscopolamine (M-4), L-hyoscyamine M-2 and M-4) and scopolamine (M-4), and between brucine and scopolamine (M-2). Positive effects of alcuronium, strychnine and brucine on the affinity of the M-2 receptors for 4-DAMP have been confirmed by direct measurements of the binding of [H-3]-4-DAMP. A comparison of molecular models of several antagonists which are esters revealed that antagonists in which the distance between the N and the carboxyl C atoms corresponds to five chemical bonds are more likely to display positive cooperativity with alcuronium at the M-2 receptors than the antagonists in which the N-carboxyl C distance corresponds to four chemical bonds.

We have also assessed the affinity of these antagonists for B2 receptors in guinea pig lung membranes by radioligand binding and the metabolic stability of peptide antagonists in guinea pig plasma and tissue homogenates. The i.v. administration of MEN 11270, Icatibant, or FR 173657 induced a dose-dependent (10-100 nmol/kg) inhibition of both hypotension and bronchoconstriction induced by bradykinin (10 nmol/kg i.v.). The inhibitory effect of MEN 11270 and Icatibant was comparable both in terms of potency and time course, whereas FR 173657 was less potent and shorter acting. After i.t. administration MEN 11270 and Icatibant (10-100 nmol/kg) dose dependently inhibited both bronchoconstriction and hypotension, whereas FR 173657 (10-100 nmol/kg) reduced bronchoconstriction without affecting hypotension. The antibronchoconstrictor effect of MEN 11270 was more prolonged than that of Icatibant and FR 173657, whereas no differences were found between the peptide antagonists in inhibiting hypotension. These findings indicated that, in vivo, the peptide antagonists are more potent and longer lasting than FR 173657 acting on bradykinin B-2 receptors in guinea pig airways and in the vascular system. The greater efficacy of the antagonists in blocking airway compared with vascular B-2 receptors after topical administration suggests that they can block airway B-2 receptors with little systemic effects.

In high doses of GC, nongenomic effects have also been found, but it is still unclear to what extent they contribute to a beneficial outcome. In this study, we present a determination of the number of lymphocyte GCR sites and the binding affinity in healthy children and children with autoimmune diseases. We further assess the effect of GC administration, especially of high-dose pulse therapy on the number of binding sites. The number of GCR sites per cell was analyzed with [H-3]-dexamethasone radioligand binding assay and binding affinity (Kd given in nM) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 48 healthy children and 35 patients. The patients were divided into three groups based on GC treatment: 0 mg/kg (group 1), 0.01-0.3 mg/kg orally (group 2), and 10-15 mg/kg i.v. pulse therapy (group 3) of prednisolone equivalent per day. Gender- and age-independent normal values of 4338 +/- 1687 sites/lymphocytes and Kd 6.7 +/- 2.2 nM were found. At 3463 +/- 1574, the number of receptor sites in patients without GC (group 1) was significantly lower than that of healthy volunteers (p < 0.05). In patients receiving GC treatment, this value was reduced to 2952 +/- 512 (group 2). Significant down-regulation to a minimum of 479 +/- 168 (group 3) was found after pulse therapy compared with untreated patients (p < 0.01). In pulse therapy, GC lead to a fast and dramatic receptor down-regulation. We suppose that the increase in therapeutic success of pulse-therapy may partly be mediated through additional nongenomic effects.

In radioligand binding assays, the l-benzyl iodine-substituted analogs exhibited higher binding affinities at both beta (1)- and beta (3)-AR subtype as compared to TMQ. In cAMP accumulation assays, these analogs exhibited high potencies at both beta (1)- and beta (3)-AR. The 3',5'-diiodo-4'-amino analog of TMQ was the most potent beta (3)-AR agonist, 17-fold more potent at the beta (3)-AR versus the beta (1)-AR. Masking of the 6,7-dihydroxy group of the catechol ring of 3',5'-diiodo-4'-acetamido analog of TMQ, a potent beta (1)- and beta (3)-AR agonist, abolished activity at both beta -AR subtypes. Furthermore, substitution of a strong electron withdrawing group such as the trifluoromethyl moiety at the 1-benzyl ring of TMQ dramatically decreased potency at beta (1)- and beta (3)-AR compared to TMQ. Replacement of the 1-benzyl ring of TMQ with a naphthalene ring did not alter affinity but reduced potency of resulting 1-naphthylmethyl and 2-naphthylmethyl analogs at beta (1)- and beta (3)-AR compared to TMQ. Our results define the structural and electronic properties of substituents on TMQ necessary for potent activation of beta (1)- and beta (3)-AR and suggest that further modifications of the 1-benzyl iodine-substituted analogs may yield potent beta (3)-AR agonists.

In the present study, we have characterized the binding sites on primary mouse calvarial osteoblasts for VIP and related peptides. By analyzing the cAMP response, the rank order of response observed was PACAP 38 > PACAP 27 > helodermin > VIP > helospectin > glucagon > PHI >>> secretin. The VIP-2R/PACAP-R antagonist, PACAP 6-38, inhibited both VIP and PACAP-stimulated cAMP formation. Binding studies using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique showed high affinity binding for VIP and PACAP 38, but not for secretin. Radioligand binding studies using I-125-VIP and I-125-PACAP 38 demonstrated a more specific and higher affinity binding for PACAP 38 than for VIP. Secretin failed to inhibit both I-125-VIP and I-125-PACAP 38 binding. RT-PCR demonstrated that undifferentiated mouse calvarial osteoblasts express messenger RNA for VIP-SR, but not for VIP-1R or PACAP-R, When the osteoblasts were cultured for 20 days to induce bone noduli formation, VIP-1R, in addition to VIP-2R, were expressed when the nodules started to mineralize at 12 days. Taken together, these data demonstrate that mouse calvarial osteoblasts express functional VIP-SR with higher affinity binding for PACAP than for VIP and that the VIP-1R expression is induced during osteoblastic differentiation.

The rank order of potency for selected compounds in competitive binding studies with the imidazoline [H-3]idazoxan was different from that in enzyme activity assays, suggesting that the IBD and the site involved in enzyme inhibition are distinct. IC50 values for inhibition of MAO-B activity by imidazoline/ guanidinium ligands were one to two orders of magnitude greater than ligand concentrations that probably saturate the IBD, but were equal to the Kd values of these ligands in competitive binding assays with the reversible MAO-B inhibitor [H-3]Ro 19-6327. In addition, the degree of enzyme inhibition by these ligands was similar in platelet and liver, tissues exhibiting 10-fold differences in the amount of the IBD-accessible enzyme subpopulation. These data suggested that the inhibitory effect of these compounds on MAO-B activity involved a secondary interaction with the enzyme domain recognizing the inhibitor Ro 19-6327 and does not involve interaction with the IBD. Subsequent radioligand-binding studies indicated that human liver MAO-B actually existed as two distinct populations that differed in the accessibility of their IBD. The relatively small amounts of MAO-B possessing an accessible IBD (similar to 5% in human liver) precludes determination of the functional consequences of ligand binding to the IBD. This subpopulation of MAO-B may be selectively regulated or generated in different individuals or tissues and targeted by pharmacologically active compounds in a cell type-specific manner.

In Vitro and In Vivo Evaluation of Pellotine: A Hypnotic Lophophora Alkaloid	ACS PHARMACOLOGY & TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Alkaloids; Hypnotic; Pellotine; Peyote; Serotonergic	5-HT7 RECEPTOR; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; SLEEP; ACTIVATION; IDENTIFICATION; ANNOUNCEMENT; EXPRESSION; INHIBITORS; BINDING	Quality of life is often reduced in patients with sleep-wake disorders. Insomnia is commonly treated with benzodiazepines, despite their well-known side effects. Pellotine (1), a Lophophora alkaloid, has been reported to have short-acting sleep-inducing properties in humans. In this study, we set out to evaluate various in vitro and in vivo properties of 1. We demonstrate that 1 undergoes slow metabolism; e.g. in mouse liver microsomes 65% remained, and in human liver microsomes virtually no metabolism was observed after 4 h. In mouse liver microsomes, two phase I metabolites were identified: 7-desmethyl-pellotine and pellotine-N-oxide. In mice, the two diastereomers of pellotine-O-glucuronide were additionally identified as phase II metabolites. Furthermore, we demonstrated by DESI-MSI that 1 readily enters the central nervous system of rodents. Furthermore, radioligand-displacement assays showed that 1 is selective for the serotonergic system and in particular the serotonin (5-HT)1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors, where it binds with affinities in the nanomolar range (117, 170, and 394 nM, respectively). Additionally, 1 was functionally characterized at 5-HT6 and 5-HT7, where it was found to be an agonist at the former (EC50 = 94 nM, E-max = 32%) and an inverse agonist at the latter (EC50 = 291 nM, E-max = -98.6). Finally, we demonstrated that 1 dose-dependently decreases locomotion in mice, inhibits REM sleep, and promotes sleep fragmentation. Thus, we suggest that pellotine itself, and not an active metabolite, is responsible for the hypnotic effects and that these effects are possibly mediated through modulation of serotonergic receptors.

F-18-PSMA-1007 is increasingly used because of its favorable imaging characteristics. However, increased non-specific skeletal uptake may be an important pitfall of this radioligand. Therefore, we aimed to assess the interobserver variation in reporting skeletal F-18-PSMA-1007 uptake on PET/CT. Design/methods:In total, 33 F-18-PSMA-1007 PET/CT scans of 21 patients with primary PCa and 12 patients with biochemical recurrence were included, and a total of 85 skeletal lesions were evaluated by three independent observers. The primary endpoint was the interobserver variability of the likelihood of malignancy of the skeletal lesions on both patient and lesion level (kappa analysis). Results:Observers qualified most lesions as not malignant (81-91%) and the overall mean interobserver agreement was moderate on both patient (& kappa;: 0.54) and lesion level (& kappa;: 0.55). In 52 lesions without corresponding CT substrate, the rating resulted in not malignant in 95-100%. Availability of additional imaging (60% of lesions) did not improve interobserver agreement (& kappa;: 0.39 on lesion level) and resulted in unchanged rating for all observers in 78%. Conclusion:This interobserver analysis of skeletal F-18-PSMA-1007 uptake resulted in moderate agreement, in line with rates reported in literature. Importantly, the presence of non-specific skeletal uptake without CT substrate, as a potential shortcoming of F-18-PSMA-1007, did not impair interobserver agreement.

Distribution of prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) on PET-MRI in patients with and without ovarian cancer	ABDOMINAL RADIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						PSMA; PET; Ovarian Cancer; Ovarian Lesions; Theranostics	LU-177-PSMA RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA; EXPRESSION; FUTURE	ObjectivesOvarian cancer is the most lethal cancer and future research needs to focus on the early detection and exploration of new therapeutic agents. The objectives of this proof-of-concept study are to assess the feasibility of PSMA 18F-DCFPyl PET/MR imaging for detecting ovarian cancer and to evaluate the PSMA distribution in patients with and without ovarian cancer.MethodsThis prospective pilot proof-of-concept study in patients with and without ovarian cancers occurred between October 2017 and January 2020. Patients were recruited from gynecologic oncology or hereditary ovarian cancer clinics, and underwent surgical removal of the uterus and ovaries for gynecologic indications. PSMA 18F-DCFPyl PET/MRI was obtained prior to standard of care surgery.ResultsFourteen patients were scanned: four patients with normal ovaries, six patients with benign ovarian lesions, and four patients with malignant ovarian lesions. Tracer uptake in normal ovaries (SUVmax = 2.8 +/- 0.4) was greater than blood pool (SUVmax = 1.8 +/- 0.5, p < 0.0001). Tracer uptake in benign ovarian lesions (2.2 +/- 1.0) did not differ significantly from blood pool (p = 0.331). Tracer uptake in ovarian cancer (SUVmax = 7.8 +/- 3.8) was greater than blood pool (p < 0.0001), normal ovaries (p = 0.0014), and benign ovarian lesions (p = 0.005).ConclusionPET/MR imaging detected PSMA uptake in ovarian cancer, with little to no uptake in benign ovarian findings. These results are encouraging and further studies in a larger patient cohort would be useful to help determine the extent and heterogeneity of PSMA uptake in ovarian cancer patients.

Patients with cognitive deficits, specifically memory disturbances, have underlying comorbid conditions such as schizophrenia, anxiety, or depression. Moreover, the available treatment options have unsatisfactory effectiveness. Therefore, there is a need to search for novel procognitive and anti-amnesic drugs with additional pharmacological activity. One of the important therapeutic targets involved in the modulation of learning and memory processes are serotonin receptors, including 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7, which also play a role in the pathophysiology of depression. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the anti-amnesic and antidepressant-like potential of JJGW08, a novel arylpiperazine alkyl derivative of salicylamide with strong antagonistic properties at 5-HT1A and D-2 receptors and weak at 5-HT2A and 5-HT7 receptors in rodents. First, we investigated the compound's affinity for 5-HT6 receptors using the radioligand assays. Next, we assessed the influence of the compound on long-term emotional and recognition memory. Further, we evaluated whether the compound could protect against MK-801-induced cognitive impairments. Finally, we determined the potential antidepressant-like activity of the tested compound. We found that JJGW08 possessed no affinity for 5-HT6 receptors. Furthermore, JJGW08 protected mice against MK-801-induced recognition and emotional memory deficits but showed no antidepressant-like effects in rodents. Therefore, our preliminary study may suggest that blocking serotonin receptors, especially 5-HT1A and 5-HT7, might be beneficial in treating cognitive impairments, but it requires further investigation.

Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of newly detected synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists AB-4CN-BUTICA, MMB-4CN-BUTINACA, MDMB-4F-BUTICA, MDMB-4F-BUTINACA and their analogs	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						synthetic cannabinoid; cannabinoid receptor 1 agonists; pharmacology; cannabinoids; SCRAs; docking; in vitro evaluation; synthesis	ANALYTICALLY CONFIRMED USE; FATAL INTOXICATION; ADB-FUBINACA; AMB-FUBINACA; AB-FUBINACA; PROTEIN; 5F-ADB; ACTIVATION; OUTBREAK; EXPOSURE	Synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists (SCRAs) continue to make up a significant portion new psychoactive substances (NPS) detected and seized worldwide. Due to their often potent activation of central cannabinoid receptors in vivo, use of SCRAs can result in severe intoxication, in addition to other adverse health effects. Recent detections of AB-4CN-BUTICA, MMB-4CN-BUTINACA, MDMB-4F-BUTICA and MDMB-4F-BUTINACA mark a continuation in the appearance of SCRAs bearing novel tail substituents. The proactive characterization campaign described here has facilitated the detection of several new SCRAs in toxicological case work. Here we detail the synthesis, characterization, and pharmacological evaluation of recently detected SCRAs, as well as a systematic library of 32 compounds bearing head, tail, and core group combinations likely to appear in future. In vitro radioligand binding assays revealed most compounds showed moderate to high affinity at both CB1 (pK(i) = < 5 to 8.89 +/- 0.09 M) and CB2 (pK(i) = 5.49 +/- 0.03 to 9.92 +/- 0.09 M) receptors. In vitro functional evaluation using a fluorescence-based membrane potential assay showed that most compounds were sub-micromolar to sub-nanomolar agonists at CB1 (pEC(50) = < 5 to 9.48 +/- 0.14 M) and CB2 (pEC(50) = 5.92 +/- 0.16 to 8.64 +/- 0.15 M) receptors. An in silico receptor-ligand docking approach was utilized to rationalize binding trends for CB2 with respect to the tail substituent, and indicated that rigidity in this region (i.e., 4-cyanobutyl) was detrimental to affinity.

However, the physiological roles of MC3R in teleosts are not well understood. In this study, qRT-PCR was used to measure gene expression. Radioligand binding assay was used to study the binding properties of topmouth culter MC3R (caMC3R). Intracellular cAMP generation was determined by RIA, and caMC3R expression was quantified with flow cytometry. We showed that culter mc3r had higher expression in the CNS. All agonists could bind and stimulate caMC3R to increase dose dependently intracellular cAMP accumulation. Compared to human MC3R, culter MC3R showed higher constitutive activity, higher efficacies, and R-max to alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), des-alpha-MSH, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone. Both caMRAP2a and caMRAP2b markedly decreased caMC3R basal cAMP production. However, only caMRAP2a significantly decreased cell surface expression, B-max, and R-max of caMC3R. Expression analysis suggested that MRAP2a and MRAP2b might be more important in regulating MC3R/MC4R signaling during larval period, and reduced mc3r, mc4r, and pomc expression might be primarily involved in modulation of MC3R/MC4R in adults. These data indicated that the cloned caMC3R was a functional receptor. MRAP2a and MRAP2b had different effects on expression and signaling of caMC3R. In addition, expression analysis suggested that MRAP2s, receptors, and hormones might play different roles in regulating culter development and growth.

Disrupted relationship between blood glucose and brain dopamine D2/3 receptor binding in patients with first-episode schizophrenia	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						(+)-[C-11]-PHNO; Glucose; Dopamine; Psychosis	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; METABOLIC DYSREGULATION; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; MORTALITY GAP; D-2 RECEPTORS; BASE-LINE; TOLERANCE; INSULIN; PHARMACOLOGY; ASSOCIATION	An elemental function of brain dopamine is to coordinate cognitive and motor resources for successful exploitation of environmental energy sources. Dopamine transmission, goal-directed behavior, and glucose homeostasis are altered in schizophrenia patients prior to and after initiation of pharmacological treatment. Thus, we investigated the relationship between blood glucose levels and brain dopamine signaling in drug-naive patients with first-episode psychosis. We quantified blood glucose levels and binding of the dopamine D2/3 receptor agonist radioligand (+)-[11C]PHNO in 15 medication-naive patients and 27 healthy volunteers employing positron emission tomography. Whole-brain voxel-wise linear model analysis identified two clusters of significant interaction between blood glucose levels and diagnosis on (+)-[11C]-PHNO binding-potential values. We observed positive relationships between blood glucose levels and binding-potential values in healthy volunteers but negative ones in patients with first episode psychosis in a cluster surviving rigorous multiple testing correction located in the in the right ventral tegmental area. Another cluster of homologous behavior, however at a lower level of statistical significance, comprised the ventral striatum and pallidum. Extracellular dopamine levels are a major determinant of (+)-[11C]-PHNO binding in the brain. In line with the concept that increased dopamine signaling occurs when goal-directed behavior is needed for restoring energy supply, our data indicate that in healthy volunteers, extracellular dopamine levels are high when blood glucose levels are low and vice-versa. This relationship is reversed in patients with first-episode psychosis, possibly reflecting an underlying pathogenic alteration that links two seemingly unrelated aspects of the illness: altered dopamine signaling and dysfunctional glucose homeostasis.

Both phenotypes are characterized by iron overload despite being caused by distinct variants that either mediate reduced cellular iron export in FD or resistance against hepcidin-induced inactivation of ferroportin in HH4. The aim of this study was to assess if reduced iron export also confers hepcidin resistance and causes iron overload in FD associated with the R178Q variant. Methods The ferroportin disease variants R178Q andA77D and the HH4-variant C326Y were overexpressed in HEK-293T cells and subcellular localization was characterized by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. Iron export and cytosolic ferritin were measured as markers of iron transport and radioligand binding studies were performed. The hepcidin-ferroportin axis was assessed by ferritin/hepcidin correlation in patients with different iron storage diseases. Results In the absence of hepcidin, the R178Q and A77D variants exported less iron when compared to normal and C326Y ferroportin. In the presence of hepcidin, the R178Q and C326Y, but not the A77D-variant, exported more iron than cells expressing normal ferroportin. Regression analysis of serum hepcidin and ferritin in patients with iron overload are compatible with hepcidin deficiency in HFE hemochromatosis and hepcidin resistance in R178Q FD. Conclusions These results support a novel concept that in certain FD variants reduced iron export and hepcidin resistance could be interlinked. Evasion of mutant ferroportin from hepcidin-mediated regulation could result in uncontrolled iron absorption and iron overload despite reduced transport function.

To evaluate (-)-5-OH-[F-18]VAT as a radiotracer for VAChT, we performed in vitro binding assay to determine the potency of the minus enantiomer (-)-5-OH-VAT and plus enantiomer (+)-5-OH-VAT, indicating that (-)-5-OH-VAT is a more potent VAChT enantiomer. Radiosynthesis of (-)-5-OH-[F-18]VAT was explored using three strategies. (-)-5-OH-[F-18]VAT was achieved with a good yield (24 +/- 6%) and high molar activity (similar to 37 GBq/mu mol, at the end of synthesis) using a microwave assisted two-step one-pot procedure that started with di-MOM protected nitro-containing precursor (-)-6. MicroPET studies in the brain of nonhuman primate (NHP) suggest that (-)-5-OH-[F-18]VAT readily penetrated the blood brain barrier and specifically accumulated in the VAChT-enriched striatum with improved washout kinetics from striatum compared to [F-18]VAT. Nevertheless, the lower target to non-target ratio may limit its use for in vivo measurement of the VAChT level in the brain.

Here we investigated inflammation-induced changes in neuronal versus glial glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors and their ligand-mediated nongenomic impact on mechanical nociception in rats. Methods: In Wistar rats (n = 5 to 7/group) with Freund's complete adjuvant hind paw inflammation, we examined glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor expression in spinal cord and peripheral sensory neurons versus glial using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and radioligand binding. Moreover, we explored the expression of mineralocorticoid receptors protecting enzyme 11-betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 as well as the nociceptive behavioral changes after glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors agonist or antagonist application. Results: Hind paw inflammation resulted in significant upregulation of glucocorticoid receptors in nociceptive neurons of spinal cord (60%) and dorsal root ganglia (15%) as well as mineralocorticoid receptors, while corticosteroid plasma concentrations remained unchanged. Mineralocorticoid (8316fmol/mg) but not glucocorticoid (104 +/- 20fmol/mg) membrane binding sites increased twofold in dorsal root ganglia concomitant with upregulated 11-betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (43%). Glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor expression in spinal microglia and astrocytes was small. Importantly, glucocorticoid receptor agonist dexamethasone or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist canrenoate-K rapidly and dose-dependently attenuated nociceptive behavior. Isobolographic analysis of the combination of both drugs showed subadditive but not synergistic or additive effects. Conclusions: The enhanced mechanical sensitivity of inflamed hind paws accompanied with corticosteroid receptor upregulation in spinal and peripheral sensory neurons was attenuated immediately after glucocorticoid receptor agonist and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist administration, suggesting acute nongenomic effects consistent with detected membrane-bound corticosteroid receptors.

One of these derivatives (DCUK-OEt) displayed micromolar affinity for brain gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptors. DCUK-OEt was shown to be a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of GABA currents with alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2, alpha 1 beta 3 gamma 2, alpha 5 beta 3 gamma 2 and alpha 1 beta 3 delta GABA(A) receptors, while having no significant PAM effect on alpha beta receptors or alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 2, alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 1, alpha 4 beta 3 gamma 2 or alpha 4 beta 3 delta receptors. DCUK-OEt modulation of alpha 1 beta 2 gamma 2 GABA(A) receptors was not blocked by flumazenil. The subunit requirements for DCUK-OEt actions distinguished DCUK-OEt from other currently known modulators of GABA function (e.g., anesthetics, neurosteroids or ethanol). Simulated docking of DCUK-OEt at the GABA(A) receptor suggested that its binding site may be at the alpha+beta- subunit interface. In slices of the central amygdala, DCUK-OEt acted primarily on extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors containing the alpha 1 subunit and generated increases in extrasynaptic "tonic" current with no significant effect on phasic responses to GABA. DCUK-OEt is a novel chemical structure acting as a PAM at particular GABA(A) receptors. Given that neurons in the central amygdala responding to DCUK-OEt were recently identified as relevant for alcohol dependence, DCUK-OEt should be further evaluated for the treatment of alcoholism.

Equilibrium and kinetic selectivity profiling on the human adenosine receptors	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Adenosine receptors; GPCR; Binding kinetics; Residence time; Binding selectivity profiling; Kinetic selectivity profiling	BINDING-KINETICS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; RESIDENCE TIME; CLASSIFICATION; NOMENCLATURE	Classical evaluation of target selectivity is usually undertaken by measuring the binding affinity of lead compounds against a number of potential targets under equilibrium conditions, without considering the kinetics of the ligand-receptor interaction. In the present study we propose a combined strategy including both equilibrium- and kinetics-based selectivity profiling. The adenosine receptor (AR) was chosen as a prototypical drug target. Six in-house AR antagonists were evaluated in a radioligand displacement assay for their affinity and in a competition association assay for their binding kinetics on three AR subtypes. One of the compounds with a promising kinetic selectivity profile was also examined in a [S-35]-GTP gamma S binding assay for functional activity. We found that XAC and LUF5964 were kinetically more selective for the A(1)R and A(3)R, respectively, although they are non-selective in terms of their affinity. In comparison, LUF5967 displayed a strong equilibrium-based selectivity for the A(1)R over the A(2A)R, yet its kinetic selectivity thereon was less pronounced. In a GTP gamma S assay, LUF5964 exhibited insurmountable antagonism on the A(3)R while having a surmountable effect on the AIR, consistent with its kinetic selectivity profile. This study provides evidence that equilibrium and kinetic selectivity profiling can both be important in the early phases of the drug discovery process. Our proposed combinational strategy could be considered for future medicinal chemistry efforts and aid the design and discovery of different or even better leads for clinical applications.

Molecular Mechanism of Action of Triazolobenzodiazepinone Agonists of the Type 1 Cholecystokinin Receptor. Possible Cooperativity across the Receptor Homodimeric Complex	JOURNAL OF MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HUMAN CCK1 RECEPTOR; DECREASES FOOD-INTAKE; BINDING-SITE; ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; DIRECT IDENTIFICATION; DISTINCT SITE; ANTAGONIST; ELUCIDATION; CHOLESTEROL; DISCOVERY	The type 1 cholecystokinin receptor (CCK1R) has multiple physiologic roles relating to nutrient homeostasis, including mediation of postcibal satiety: This effect has been central in efforts to develop agonists of this receptor as part of a program to manage and/or prevent obesity. While a number of small molecule CCK1R agonists have been developed, none have yet been approved for clinical use, based on inadequate efficacy, side effects, or the potential for toxicity. Understanding the molecular details of docking and mechanism of action of these ligands can be helpful in the rational refinement and enhancement of small molecule dog candidates. In the current work, we have defined the mechanism of binding and activity of two triazolobenzodiazepinones, CE-326597 and PF-04756956, which are reported to be full agonist ligands. To achieve this, we utilized receptor binding with a series of allosteric and orthosteric radioligands at structurally related CCK1R and CCK2R, as well as chimeric CCK1R/CCK2R constructs exchanging residues in the allosteric pocket, and assessment of biological activity. These triazolobenzodiazepinones docked within the intramembranous small molecule allosteric ligand pocket, with higher affinity binding to CCK2R than CCK1R, yet with biological activity exclusive to or greatly enhanced at CCK1R. These ligands exhibited cooperativity with benzodiazepine binding across the CCK1R homodimeric complex, resulting in their ability to inhibit only a fraction of the saturable binding of a benzodiazepine radioligand, unlike other small molecule antagonists and agonists of this receptor. This may contribute to the understanding of the unique short duration and reversible gallbladder contraction observed in vivo upon administration of these drugs.

However, little is known about the binding energetics of these inhibitors to nucleoside transporters (NTs) due to their low endogenous expression levels and difficulties in the biophysical characterization of purified protein with ligands. Here, we present kinetics and thermodynamic analyses of inhibitor binding to the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1), also known as SLC29A1. Using a radioligand binding assay, we obtained equilibrium binding and kinetic rate constants of well-known NT inhibitors - [H-3]nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside ([H-3]NBMPR), dilazep, and dipyridamole - and the native permeant, adenosine, to hENT1. We observed that the equilibrium binding affinities for all inhibitors decreased whereas, the kinetic rate constants increased with increasing temperature. Furthermore, we found that binding is enthalpy driven and thus, an exothermic reaction, implying that the transporter does not discriminate between its inhibitors and substrates thermodynamically. This predominantly enthalpy-driven binding by four chemically distinct ligands suggests that the transporter may not tolerate diversity in the type of interactions that lead to high affinity binding. Consistent with this, the measured activation energy of [H-3]NBMPR association was relatively large (20 kcal mol(-1)) suggesting a conformational change upon inhibitor binding. For all three inhibitors the enthalpy (AH) and entropy (AS) contributions to the reaction energetics were determined by van't Hoff analysis to be roughly similar (25-75% Delta G degrees). Gains in enthalpy with increasing polar surface area of inhibitors suggest that the binding is favored by electrostatic or polar interactions between the ligands and the transporter.

Whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry estimates of a novel radiotracer for imaging of serotonin 4 receptors in brain: [<SUP>18</SUP>F]MNI-698	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						5-HT4 receptors; Brain imaging; [F-18]MNI-698; Dosimetry; Biodistribution	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT4 RECEPTORS; RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; PET RADIOLIGAND; IN-VIVO; PHARMACOLOGY; ENHANCEMENT; ACTIVATION; AGONIST; MONKEY	Introduction: A new radiotracer for imaging the serotonin 4 receptors (5-HT4) in brain, [F-18]MNI-698, was recently developed by our group. Evaluation in nonhuman primates indicates the novel radiotracer holds promise as an imaging agent of 5-HT4 in brain. This paper aims to describe the whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry estimates of [F-18]MNI-698. Methods: Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired over 240 minutes after intravenous bolus injection of [F-18]MNI-698 in adult rhesus monkeys. Different models were investigated for quantification of radiation absorbed and effective doses using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software. Results: The radiotracer main elimination route was found to be urinary and the critical organ was the urinary bladder. Modeling of the urinary bladder voiding interval had a considerable effect on the estimated effective dose. Normalization of rhesus monkeys' organs and whole-body masses to human equivalent reduced the calculated dosimetry values. The effective dose ranged between 0.017 and 0.027 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: The dosimetry estimates, obtained when normalizing organ and whole-body weights and applying the urinary bladder model, indicate that the radiation doses from [F-18]MNI-698 comply with limits and guidelines recommended by key regulatory authorities that govern the translation of radiotracers to human clinical trials.

When compared to the striatum, higher SERT occupancy in the midbrain and lower values in the thalamus were reported. This indicates that occupancy might be differently distributed throughout the brain, which is supported by preclinical findings indicating a regionally varying SERT activity and antidepressant drug concentration. The present study therefore aimed to investigate regional SEAT occupancies with positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]DASB in 19 depressed patients after acute and prolonged intake of oral doses of either 10 mg/day escitalopram or 20 mg/day citalopram. Compared to the mean occupancy across cortical and subcortical regions, we detected increased SERT occupancies in regions commonly associated with antidepressant response, such as the subgenual cingulate, amygdala and raphe nuclei. When acute and prolonged drug intake was compared, SERT occupancies increased in subcortical areas that are known to be rich in SERT. Moreover, SERT occupancy in subcortical brain areas after prolonged intake of antidepressants was predicted by plasma drug levels. Similarly, baseline SERT binding potential seems to impact SERT occupancy, as regions rich in SERT showed greater binding reduction as well as higher residual binding. These findings suggest a region-specific distribution of SERT blockage by SSRIs and relate the postulated link between treatment response and SEAT occupancy to certain brain regions such as the subgenual cingulate cortex.

Modulation of the conformational state of the SV2A protein by an allosteric mechanism as evidenced by ligand binding assays	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						SV2A; levetiracetam; epilepsy; positive allosteric modulation; anticonvulsant	SYNAPTIC VESICLE PROTEIN; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; HUMAN BRAIN; LEVETIRACETAM; SITE; SYNAPTOTAGMIN; MICE; RAT	Background and Purpose Synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) is the specific binding site of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV) and its higher affinity analogue UCB30889. Moreover, the protein has been well validated as a target for anticonvulsant therapy. Here, we report the identification of UCB1244283 acting as a SV2A positive allosteric modulator of UCB30889. Experimental Approach UCB1244283 was characterized in vitro using radioligand binding assays with [3H]UCB30889 on recombinant SV2A expressed in HEK cells and on rat cortex. In vivo, the compound was tested in sound-sensitive mice. Key Results Saturation binding experiments in the presence of UCB1244283 demonstrated a fivefold increase in the affinity of [3H]UCB30889 for human recombinant SV2A, combined with a twofold increase of the total number of binding sites. Similar results were obtained on rat cortex. In competition binding experiments, UCB1244283 potentiated the affinity of UCB30889 while the affinity of LEV remained unchanged. UCB1244283 significantly slowed down both the association and dissociation kinetics of [3H]UCB30889. Following i.c.v. administration in sound-sensitive mice, UCB1244283 showed a clear protective effect against both tonic and clonic convulsions. Conclusions and Implications These results indicate that UCB1244283 can modulate the conformation of SV2A, thereby inducing a higher affinity state for UCB30889. Our results also suggest that the conformation of SV2Aper se might be an important determinant of its functioning, especially during epileptic seizures. Therefore, agents that act on the conformation of SV2A might hold great potential in the search for new SV2A-based anticonvulsant therapies.	[Daniels, V.; Wood, M.; Leclercq, K.; Kaminski, R.

Multiple receptors including muscarinic (M-3/M-5), tachykinin (NK1/NK2), and purinergic (P2X(1)/P2Y(6)) receptors are involved in bladder motor and sensory actions. Using female pig bladder, our aim was to differentiate between various cell types in bladder by genetic markers. We compared the molecular expression pattern between the fresh tissue layers and their cultured cell counterparts. We also examined responses to agonists for these receptors in cultured cells. Urothelial, suburothelial (myofibroblasts), and smooth muscle cells isolated from pig bladder were cultured (10-14 days) and identified by marker antibodies. Gene (mRNA) expression level was demonstrated by real-time PCR. The receptor expression pattern was very similar between suburothelium and detrusor, and higher than urothelium. The gene expression of all receptors decreased in culture compared with the fresh tissue, although the reduction in cultured urothelial cells appeared less significant compared to suburothelial and detrusor cells. Cultured myofibroblasts and detrusor cells did not contract in response to the agonists acetylcholine, neurokinin A, and beta,gamma-MeATP up to concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mM. The significant reduction of M-3, NK2, and P2X(1) receptors under culture conditions may be associated with the unresponsiveness of cultured suburothelial and detrusor cells to their respective agonists. These results suggest that under culture conditions, bladder cells lose the receptors that are involved in contraction, as this function is no longer required. The study provides further evidence that cultured cells do not necessarily mimic the actions exerted by intact tissues.

As aging and hypertension may impact pelvic arterial blood flow resulting in bladder and penile dysfunction, we investigated effects of age and hypertension on alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the major source arteries of the rat bladder and penis. Using radioligand receptor binding, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescent microsphere infusion techniques, we compared 3 and 22-month-old male Fischer rats, and male normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WRY) rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Twenty-two-month-old rats and SHRs had significantly higher total alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density in the internal iliac artery and lower blood flow to the bladder and penis than 3-month-old and WRY rats, respectively. RT-PCR data showed an age and hypertension related increase in the expression of alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor mRNA in the internal iliac, vesical and internal pudendal arteries and a switch from alpha(1A) predominance in 3-month-old and WRY rats to alpha(1B)>alpha(1A) in 22-month-old rats and SHRs. Our data indicate the presence of age and hypertension related alterations in vascular alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtype distribution and in blood flow to the rat bladder and penis. These findings suggest that pharmacological blockade of the vascular alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor, which could increase pelvic blood flow, may contribute to the improvement of bladder and penile dysfunctions in animal models for aging and hypertension.

While initially manufactured as an immediate-release (IR) formulation, an extended-release (XR) formulation has recently been introduced. Pharmacokinetic studies show that quetiapine XR provides a lower peak and more stable plasma concentration than the IR formulation. This study investigated if the pharmacokinetic differences translate into different time curves for central D-2 dopamine receptor occupancy. Eleven control subjects were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [C-11] raclopride. Eight subjects underwent all of the scheduled PET measurements. After baseline examination, quetiapine XR was administered once-daily for 8 d titrated to 300 mg/d on days 5-8, followed by 300 mg/d quetiapine IR on days 9-12. PET measurements were repeated after the last doses of quetiapine XR and IR at predicted times of peak and trough plasma concentrations. Striatal D-2 receptor occupancy was calculated using the simplified reference tissue model. Peak D-2 receptor occupancy was significantly higher with quetiapine IR than XR in all subjects (50+/-4% and 32+/-11%, respectively), consistent with lower peak plasma concentrations for the XR formulation. Trough D-2 receptor occupancy was similarly low for both formulations (IR 7+/-7%, XR 8+/-6 %). The lower peak receptor occupancy associated with quetiapine XR may explain observed pharmacodynamic differences between the formulations. Assuming that our findings in control subjects are valid for patients with schizophrenia, the study supports the view that quetiapine, like the prototype atypical antipsychotic clozapine, may show antipsychotic effect at lower D-2 receptor occupancy than typical antipsychotics.

From a series of 11 compounds, candidates were identified to have a high binding affinity for A beta. Selected compounds were prepared as O- or N-[C-11]methyl derivatives and shown to have a high initial brain uptake in wild-type mice (range 1.9-9.2% I.D./g at 5 min). 2-(p-[C-11]Methylaminophenyl)-7-methoxyimidazo[2,1-b] benzothiazole ([C-11]5) was identified as a lead based on the combined favorable properties of high initial brain uptake, rapid clearance from normal brain, and high in vitro affinity for A beta(1-40) (K-i = 3.5 nM) and A beta(1-42) (5.8 nM), which were superior to the Pittsburgh compound B (1a). In an APP/PSI mouse model of AD (Tg), we demonstrate a specific uptake of [C-11]5 in A beta-containing telencephalic brain regions by means of small-animal PET that was confirmed by regional brain biodistribution, ex vivo autoradiography, and immunohistochemistry. Analysis of brain sections of Tg mice receiving a single bolus injection of [C-11]5 and [H-3]1a together revealed that the tracers bind to A beta plaques in the brain of Tg mice in a comparable pattern. Taken together, these data suggest that IBTs represent useful PET imaging agents for high-sensitivity detection of A beta plaques.

This article describes the evaluation of three candidate GlyT1 PET radioligands (GSK931145, GSK565710, and GSK991022) selected from a library of compounds based on favorable physicochemical and pharmacological properties. Each candidate was successfully labeled using [C-11]methyl iodide or [C-11]methyl triflate and administered to a pig pre- and postadministration with a pharmacological dose of a GlyT1 inhibitor to determine their suitability as PET ligands in the porcine brain in vivo. All three candidate ligands were analyzed quantitatively with compartment analyses employing a plasma input function. [C-11]GSK931145 showed good brain penetration and a heterogeneous distribution in agreement with reported GlyT1 localization. Following pretreatment with GSK565710, uptake of [C-11]GSK931145 was reduced to homogeneous levels. Although [C-11]GSK565710 also showed good brain penetration and a heterogeneous distribution, the apparent level of specific binding was reduced compared to [C-11]GSK931145. In contrast, [C-11]GSK991022 showed a much lower brain penetration and resultant signal following pretreatment with GSK565710. Based on these findings [C-11]GSK931145 was identified as the most promising ligand for imaging GlyT1 in the porcine brain, possessing good brain penetration, specific signal, and reversible kinetics. [C-11]GSK931145 is now being progressed into higher species. Synapse 64:542-549, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Imaging of PBR/TSPO by positron emission tomography (PET) using radiolabeled ligands can document inflammatory processes induced by cerebral ischemia. We performed in vivo PET imaging with [F-18]DPA-714 to determine the time course of PBR/TSPO expression over several days after induction of cerebral ischemia in rats. In vivo PET imaging showed significant increase in DPA (N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide) uptake on the injured side compared with that in the contralateral area on days 7, 11, 15, and 21 after ischemia; the maximal binding value was reached 11 days after ischemia. In vitro autoradiography confirmed these in vivo results. In vivo and in vitro [F-18]DPA-714 binding was displaced from the lesion by PK11195 and DPA-714. Immunohistochemistry showed increased PBR/TSPO expression, peaking at day 11 in cells expressing microglia/macrophage antigens in the ischemic area. At later times, a centripetal migration of astrocytes toward the lesion was observed, promoting the formation of an astrocytic scar. These results show that [F-18]DPA-714 provides accurate quantitative information of the time course of PBR/TSPO expression in experimental stroke.

Pre-treatment with certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as Ro 41-1049 [N-(2-aminomethyl)-5-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-thiazolecarboxamide HCl], changes the sensitized response from locomotion to stationary, self-directed mouthing. In this study, the effects of quinpirole sensitization, with and without pre-treatment with Ro 41-1049, were determined on dopamine D-2-like receptors in the nucleus accumbens and the striatum. Long-Evans rats were pre-treated with Ro 41-1049 (1 mg/kg) 90 min prior to administration of quinpirole (0.5 mg/kg. 8 injections, every 34 days). Dopamine D2-like receptor binding was determined 3 days after the last injection by ex vivo radioligand assays using [H-3]spiperone and [H-3]quinpirole. Densities of [H-3]spiperone- and [H-3]quinpirole-labeled sites were both increased 32% in the nucleus accumbens of rats with demonstrated locomotor sensitization to quinpirole. In contrast, the density of dopamine D2-like receptors in quinpirole-sensitized rats pre-treated with Ro 41-1049 was not different from saline controls. These findings support the involvement of alterations in dopamine D2-like receptors in the development of locomotor sensitization to quinpirole and suggest that modification of these alterations in dopamine D2-like receptors contributes to the change from sensitized locomotion to mouthing observed when rats are pre-treated with Ro 41-1049.

Lymphatic and/or blood vessel invasion in gastric cancer:: relationship with clinicopathological parameters, biological factors and prognostic significance	JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						gastric cancer; tumoral invasion; prognosis	GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; PRIMARY TUMOR LOCATION; LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION; BREAST-CANCER; CLINICAL-SIGNIFICANCE; MICROVESSEL INVASION; PERINEURAL INVASION; VASCULAR INVASION; SURGICAL OUTCOMES; NODE METASTASIS	Background Lymphatic and/or blood vessel tumoral invasion (LBVI) is a common histopathologic finding of gastric carcinomas, which could make it an additional cost efficient marker and help in the detection of patients at risk for recurrence. Materials and methods The subjects of this study were 144 patients with primary gastric adenocarcinoma, who consecutively underwent surgery. LBVI was evaluated by H&E staining and complementary with immunohistochemical staining with anti-CD34. Intratumoral levels of EGFR were analyzed with a radioligand technique, whereas c-erbB-2 and tPA were determined by ELISA methods; pS2, cathepsin D and hyaluronic acid by immunoradiometric assays; and VEGFR-1 and -2 by immunohistochemical assays. The mean follow-up period for these patients was 33.1 months. Results LBVI was present in 46 patients (31.9%). The presence of LBVI correlated significantly with tumor stage, lymph node involvement, surgical resectability, histological type and histological grade, being present in a higher percentage among II-IV tumor stage (P = 0.0001), poorly differentiated (P = 0.01), diffuse type (P = 0.009), R1-R2 (P = 0.002) and lymph node-positive (P = 0.005) tumors. In addition, statistical analysis demonstrated that LBVI was significantly associated with a poorer overall patients' survival in the univariate analysis (P = 0.0001) as well as in the multivariate analysis (P = 0.009). However, our results failed to show any significant relationship between LBVI and any of the intratumoral biological parameters studied. Conclusion LBVI provides additional useful information that could be applied to identify gastric cancer patients at risk for recurrence, who might be candidates for further adjuvant therapies.

Functional vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the t-tubules of cardiac myocytes: VDR knockout cardiomyocyte contractility	ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article							SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION PATHWAY; SKELETAL-MUSCLE CELLS; PROTEIN-KINASE-C; CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION; GENE-EXPRESSION; CALCIUM-UPTAKE; HEART-FAILURE; D-3; MEMBRANE; PHOSPHORYLATION	We have previously shown that the active form of vitamin D, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)(2)D-3], has both genomic and rapid nongenomic effects in heart cells; however, the subcellular localization of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in heart has not been studied. Here we show that in adult rat cardiac myocytes the VDR is primarily localized to the t-tubule. Using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis, we show that the VDR is closely associated with known t-tubule proteins. Radioligand binding assays using H-3-labeled 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 demonstrate that a t-tubule membrane fraction isolated from homogenized rat ventricles contains a 1,25(OH)(2)D-3-binding activity similar to the classic VDR. For the first time, we show that cardiac myocytes isolated from VDR knockout mice show accelerated rates of contraction and relaxation as compared with wild type and that 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 directly affects contractility in the wild-type but not the knockout cardiac myocyte. Moreover, we observed that acute (5 min) exposure to 1,25(OH)(2)D-3 altered the rate of relaxation. A receptor localized to t-tubules in the heart is ideally positioned to exert an immediate effect on signal transduction mediators and ion channels. This novel discovery is fundamentally important in understanding 1,25(H)(2)D-3 signal transduction in heart cells and provides further evidence that the VDR plays a role in heart structure and function.

In membranes, saturation experiment performed with [H-3]DPCPX, selective A(1)R antagonist, revealed a single binding site with a K-D = 9.4 +/- a1.4 nM and B-max = 62.7 +/- a8.6 fmol/mg protein. Binding of [H-3]DPCPX in intact cell revealed a K-D = 17.7 +/- a1.3 nM and B-max = 567.1 +/- 26.5 fmol/mg protein. On the other hand, [H-3]ZM241385 binding experiments revealed a single binding site population of receptors with K-D = 16.5 +/- 1.3 nM and B-max = 358.9 +/- 52.4 fmol/mg protein in intact cells, and K-D = 4.7 +/- 0.6 nM and B-max = 74.3 +/- 7.9 fmol/mg protein in plasma membranes, suggesting the presence of A(2A) receptor in C6 cells. A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3) adenosine receptors were detected by Western-blotting and immunocytochemistry, and their mRNAs quantified by real time PCR assays. Gi alpha and Gs alpha proteins were also detected by Western-blotting and RT-PCR assays. Furthermore, selective A(1)R agonists inhibited forskolin- and GTP-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and CGS 21680 and NECA stimulated this enzymatic activity in C6 cells. These results suggest that C6 glioma cells endogenously express A(1) and A(2) receptors functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase inhibition and stimulation, respectively, and suggest these cells as a model to study the role of adenosine receptors in tumoral cells.

Histamine H<sub>3</sub>-receptor agonists and imidazole-based H<sub>3</sub>-receptor antagonists can be thermodynamically discriminated	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						[H-3] clobenpropit; histamine H-3-receptors	H-3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS; PIG CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BINDING THERMODYNAMICS; LIGAND-BINDING; HOMOLOGS; SITES	Background and purpose: Studies suggest that measurement of thermodynamic parameters can allow discrimination of agonists and antagonists. Here we investigate whether agonists and antagonists can be thermodynamically discriminated at histamine H-3 receptors. Experimental approach: The pK(L) of the antagonist radioligand, [H-3]-clobenpropit, in guinea-pig cortex membranes was estimated at 4, 12, 21 and 30 degrees C in 20mM HEPES-NaOH buffer (buffer A), or buffer A containing 300mM CaCl2, (buffer A(Ca)). pK(I)' values for ligands with varying intrinsic activity were determined in buffer A and ACa at 4, 12, 21 and 30 degrees C. Key results: In buffer A, the pKL of [H-3]-clobenpropit increased with decreasing temperature while it did not change in buffer ACa. The Bmax was not affected by temperature or buffer and n(H) values were not different from unity. In buffer A, pK(I)' values for agonists remained unchanged or decreased with decreasing temperature, while antagonist pK(I) values increased with decreasing temperature; agonist binding was entropy-driven while antagonist binding was enthalpy and entropy-driven. In buffer ACa, temperature had no effect on antagonist and agonist pKI values; both agonist and antagonist binding were enthalpy and entropy-driven. Conclusions and implications: The binding of H-3-receptor agonists and antagonists can be thermodynamically discriminated under conditions where agonist pK(I)' values are over-estimated (pK(I)' not equal apKapp). However, under conditions when agonist pK(I) similar to pK(app), the thermodynamics underlying the binding of agonists are not different to those of antagonists.

In this study, we characterized the pharmacological activity and structural basis for subunit selectivity of neodysiherbaine (neoDH) and MSVIII-19, which are natural and synthetic analogs of DH, respectively. NeoDH and MSVIII-19 differ from DH in the composition of two functional groups that confer specificity and selectivity for ionotropic glutamate receptors. In radioligand binding assays, neoDH displayed a 15- to 25-fold lower affinity relative to that of DH for glutamate receptor (GluR)5 and GluR6 kainate receptor subunits but a 7-fold higher affinity for kainate (KA)2 subunits, whereas MSVIII-19 displaced [H-3] kainate only from GluR5 subunits but not GluR6 or KA2 subunits. NeoDH was an agonist for kainate and alpha-amino-3hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in patch-clamp recordings; in contrast, MSVIII-19 acted as a potent antagonist for homomeric GluR5 receptor currents with weaker activity on other kainate and AMPA receptors. Neither neoDH nor MSVIII-19 activated group I metabotropic GluRs. Homology modeling suggests that two critical amino acids confer the high degree of selectivity between the dysiherbaine analogs and the GluR5 and KA2 subunits. In summary, these data describe the pharmacological activity of two new compounds, one of which is a selective GluR5 receptor antagonist that will be of use for understanding native receptor function and designing more selective ligands for kainate receptors.

The acute sedative action of diazepam is mediated via alpha(1)-GABA(A) receptors. Therefore, we tested whether chronic activation of these receptors by diazepam is sufficient to induce tolerance to its sedative action. Knock-in mice, in which the alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-, alpha(3)-, or alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors had been rendered insensitive to diazepam by histidine-arginine point mutation, were chronically treated with diazepam (8 d; 15 mg.kg(-1).d(-1)) and tested for motor activity. Wild-type, alpha(2)(H101R), and alpha(3)(H126R) mice showed a robust diminution of the motor-depressant drug action. In contrast, alpha(5)(H105R) mice failed to display any sedative tolerance. alpha(1)(H101R) mice showed no alteration of motor activity with chronic diazepam treatment. Autoradiography with [H-3]flumazenil revealed no change in benzodiazepine binding sites. However, a decrease in alpha(5)-subunit radioligand binding was detected selectively in the dentate gyrus with specific ligands. This alteration was observed only in diazepam-tolerant animals, indicating that the manifestation of tolerance to the sedative action of diazepam is associated with a downregulation of alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors in the dentate gyrus. Thus, the chronic activation of alpha(5)-GABA(A) receptors is crucial for the normal development of sedative tolerance to diazepam, which manifests itself in conjunction with alpha(1)-GABA(A) receptors.

In contrast, AT(2) receptor - mediated vasodilation could not be observed in large human coronary arteries. We studied Ang II - induced vasodilation of human coronary microarteries (HCMAs). Methods and Results - HCMAs (diameter, 160 to 500 mum) were obtained from 49 heart valve donors ( age, 3 to 65 years). Ang II constricted HCMAs, mounted in Mulvany myographs, in a concentration-dependent manner (pEC(50), 8.6 +/- 0.2; maximal effect [E-max], 79 +/- 13% of the contraction to 100 mmol/L K+). The Ang II type 1 receptor antagonist irbesartan prevented this vasoconstriction, whereas the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319 increased Emax to 97 +/- 14% (P < 0.05). The increase in Emax was larger in older donors ( correlation Delta E-max versus age, r = 0.47, P < 0.05). The PD123319-induced potentiation was not observed in the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME, the bradykinin type 2 (B-2) receptor antagonist Hoe140, or after removal of the endothelium. Ang II relaxed U46619-preconstricted HCMAs in the presence of irbesartan by maximally 49 +/- 16%, and PD123319 prevented this relaxation. Finally, radioligand binding studies and reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction confirmed the expression of AT(2) receptors in HCMAs. Conclusions - AT(2) receptor - mediated vasodilation in the human heart appears to be limited to coronary microarteries and is mediated by B-2 receptors and NO. Most likely, AT(2) receptors are located on endothelial cells, and their contribution increases with age.

In the present study, we studied the potential of [C-11]TMSX for myocardial imaging. Uptake of radioactivity by the heart was high and gradually decreased after an intravenous injection of [C-11]TMSX into mice. In metabolite analysis, 54% and 76% of the radioactivity in plasma and heart, respectively, were present as the unchanged form of [C-11]TMSX 60 min postinjection. The myocardial uptake was reduced by carrier-loading and by co-injection of an adenosine A(2A) antagonist CSC, but not by co-injection of an adenosine A(1) antagonist DPCPX. Pretreatment with a high dose of a non-selective antagonist theophylline also reduced the myocardial uptake of [C-11]TMSX. These findings demonstrate the specific binding of [C-11]TMSX to adenosine A(2A) receptors in the heart. Finally we successfully performed the myocardial imaging by PET with [C-11]TMSX in a normal volunteer. A graphical analysis by Logan plot supported the receptor-mediated uptake of [C-11]TMSX. Peripherally [C-11]TMSX was very stable in human: >90% of the radioactivity in plasma was detected as the unchanged form in a 60-min study. We concluded that [C-11]TMSX PET has the potential for myocardial imaging.

Radioligand binding and Western blotting studies were employed to determine whether DA receptors are present in feline kidneys. The pharmacologic profile of the selective D-1 -receptor antagonist [(3) H]-SCH 23390 was studied in renal cortical membrane preparations from cats by conducting saturation binding isotherm and competitive binding experiments. [(3) H]-SCH 23390 bound to feline renal cortical membranes in a manner consistent with labeling of a D-1 -like receptor. The binding profile revealed a single site D-1 -like or D-1 receptor in the feline renal cortex with a K (d) = 7.8 +/- 1.0 nmol/L and B (max) = 76.5 +/- 19.5 fmol/mg. Competitive binding studies for [(3) H]-SCH 23390 against unlabeled agonists yielded the following K (i) values and rank order of competition: SKF38393 (K (i) = 0.47 +/- 0.26 mu m) > fenoldopam (K (i) = 3.12 +/- 1.1 mu m) > DA (K (i) = 933.1 +/- 1.6 mu m). Competitive binding studies for [(3) H]-SCH-23390 against unlabeled antagonists yielded the following rank order of competition: SCH 23390 (K (i) = 1.97 +/- 0.81 mu m) > spiperone (K (i) = 3.79 +/- 0.79) > metoclopramide (K (i) = 4.26 +/- 2.4 mu m). Western blot analysis with anti-DA D-1 receptor antibodies detected a single band with M (r) of 74 kDa corresponding to a D-1 DA receptor. These results suggest that a putative D-1 -like or D-1 receptor exists in feline kidneys different from those previously identified in rat, dog or human kidneys.

The corresponding sila-analogues 1b-4b (--> replacement of the carbon spirocenter by a silicon atom) were synthesized in three-step syntheses, starting from dichlorodivinylsilane, and were isolated as the hydrochlorides 1b . HCl-4b . HCl. To get information about the structure of the title compounds and their respective carbon analogues in the solid state and in solution, crystal structure analyses (1a . HCl, 2a, 2b-HCl) and temperature-dependent solution H-1 NMR studies (2a . HCl, 2b-HCl) were performed. These structural investigations were complemented by computational studies of related model species. The C/Si pairs 1a/1b-4a/4b were studied for their affinities for various central nervous system receptors (sigma, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, alpha(1), alpha(2), M, D-2) using radioligand binding assays. The sigma affinities of the sila-analogues 2b-4b were found to be similar to those of the parent carbon compounds 2a-4a, whereas sila-substitution of 1a (--> 1b) resulted in a decrease of affinity of about 1 order of magnitude. On the other hand, a significant increase of affinity for the dopamine D-2 and the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors was observed for the sila-analogues 1b-4b, the sila-substitution effect being especially pronounced for 4a/4b (6-fold affinity increase for the D-2 receptor) and 3a/3b (37-fold affinity increase for the 5-HT2A receptor).

Identification of the specific muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtype(s) mediating this activity is of considerable therapeutic interest. To examine the roles of the M-2 and M-4 receptor subtypes, the two G(i)/G(o)-coupled mAChRs, in mediating agonist-dependent antinociception, we generated a mutant mouse line deficient in both M-2 and M-4 mAChRs [M-2/M-4 double-knockout (KO) mice]. In wild-type mice, systemic, intrathecal, or intracerebroventricular administration of centrally active muscarinic agonists resulted in robust analgesic effects, indicating that muscarinic analgesia can be mediated by both spinal and supraspinal mechanisms. Strikingly, muscarinic agonist-induced antinociception was totally abolished in M-2/M-4 double-KO mice, independent of the route of application. The nonselective muscarinic agonist oxotremorine showed reduced analgesic potency in M-2 receptor single-KO mice, but retained full analgesic activity in M-4 receptor single-KO mice. In contrast, two novel muscarinic agonists chemically derived from epibatidine, CMI-936 and CMI-1145, displayed reduced analgesic activity in both M-2 and M-4 receptor single-KO mice, independent of the route of application. Radioligand binding studies indicated that the two CMI compounds, in contrast to oxotremorine, showed >6-fold higher affinity for M-4 than for M-2 receptors, providing a molecular basis for the observed differences in agonist activity profiles. These data provide unambiguous evidence that muscarinic analgesia is exclusively mediated by a combination of M-2 and M-4 mAChRs at both spinal and supraspinal sites. These findings should be of considerable relevance for the development of receptor subtype-selective muscarinic agonists as novel analgesic drugs.

F2 generation (C57BL6/Sv129J) NTR1 knockout (-/-) mice were viable, and showed normal growth and overt behavior. The -/- mice lacked detectable NTR1 radioligand binding in brain, whereas NTR2 receptor binding density appeared normal compared with wildtype (+/+) mice. The gene deletion also resulted in the loss of NTR1 expression as determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization. Intracerebro-ventricular injection of NT (1 mug) to +/+ mice caused a robust hypothermic response (5-6degreesC) and a significant increase in hot-plate latency. These effects were absent in the -/- mice. Similar results were obtained with i.p. injections of the brain-penetrant NT analog NMe-Arg-Lys-Pro-Trp-Tle-Leu (NT-2, 1 mg/kg i.p.). NT-2 administration also impaired rotarod performance in wild-type mice, but had no effect on motor coordination in knockout mice. In vitro, NT and NT-2 at 30 nM caused predominantly contraction and relaxation in isolated distal colon and proximal ileum, respectively, from mice, but no responses were observed with tissues from mice. A similar loss of the contractile effects of NT was observed in the isolated stomach fundus from the knockout mice. In vivo, NT-2 administration reduced colonic propulsion substantially in wild-type mice. In contrast, NT-2 had no effect in NTR1 null mice, whereas the hypomotility effect of clonidine was intact. These data indicate that NTR1 mediates several of the central and peripheral effects of NT.

J	Lee, S; Kramer, CM; Mankad, S; Yoo, S; Sandberg, K				Lee, S; Kramer, CM; Mankad, S; Yoo, S; Sandberg, K			Combined angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition and angiotensin AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blockade up-regulates myocardial AT<sub>2</sub> receptors in remodeled myocardium post-infarction	CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						ACE inhibitors; angiotensin; antihypertensive/diuretic agents; infarction; remodeling; receptors; renin angiotensin system	II TYPE-2 RECEPTOR; LEFT-VENTRICULAR DYSFUNCTION; CONGESTIVE-HEART-FAILURE; CARDIOVASCULAR EVENTS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; SUBTYPES; INFARCTION; AT(1)-RECEPTOR; LOCALIZATION; OVEREXPRESSION	Objectives: In an ovine model of left ventricular (LV) remodeling after transmural anteroapical myocardial infarction (MI), we have previously demonstrated that the combination of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT(1) receptor blockade is more effective at limiting LV remodeling than either therapy alone. We hypothesized that the beneficial effect of combined therapy is due in part to upregulation of AT(2) receptor levels. Methods: Two days after transmural anteroapical MI by coronary ligation, 16 sheep were randomized to losartan (50 mg/day), ramipril (10 mg/day), ramipril+losartan (combined therapy), or no therapy. At 8 weeks after MI, radioligand receptor assay were deployed with homogenates from regional LV tissues. Results: We found that AT receptors in normal sheep myocardium are predominantly of the AT(2) receptor subtype. Binding studies of remodeled myocardium 8 weeks later showed that the apparent maximum binding (B-max) was increased from 23 to 48 fmol/mg protein only in animals with combined therapy. The AT(2)/AT(1) proportion was increased significantly in animals with combined therapy compared to infarcted controls (18.0 vs. 5.17). Conclusions: These results indicate that AT(2) receptor expression increased significantly during LV remodeling with combined therapy but not with either therapy alone. In combination with prior work demonstrating the effectiveness of combined therapy in limiting LV remodeling, this study is consistent with the hypothesis that AT(2) receptors play a cardioprotective role in LV remodeling after MI.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Recent-onset type 1 diabetic patients (n = 100), prediabetic siblings (n = 23), and nondiabetic control subjects (n = 100) were consecutively recruited by the Belgian Diabetes Registry. GLIMA antibodies were determined by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled islet cell proteins, islet cell antibodies (ICAs) were determined by indirect immunofluorescence; and insulin autoantibodies (IAAs), insulinoma-associated protein-2 antibodies (IA-2As), and GAD antibodies (GADAs) were determined by radioligand assays. RESULTS - GLIMA antibodies were detected in 38% of type 1 diabetic patients and 35% of prediabetic siblings (during follow-up) vs. 0% in control subjects (P < 0.001). Their prevalence was lower than that of other antibodies and was significantly associated with high levels of IA-2A and ICA (P < 0.0001). In (pre)diabetes, GLIMA antibodies could only be demonstrated in sera positive for greater than or equal to1 other autoantibody. CONCLUSIONS - GLIMA antibodies are strongly associated with type 1 diabetes and antibody markers of rapid progression to clinical onset but have a lower diagnostic sensitivity for the disease than IAA, ICE, IA-2A, or GADA. In its present form, the GLIMA antibody assay does not provide much additional information for prediction or classification of diabetes, compared with that obtained from the measurement of IA-2As alone or in combination with IAAs, ICAs, and GADAs.

To clarify the functional role of I(DR Ig-like domains 4-7, we compared VEGF-induced signaling in human embryonic kidney and porcine aortic endothelial cells expressing native versus mutant receptor proteins in which Ig-like domains 4-7, 4-6, or 7 had been deleted. Western blotting using an anti-receptor antibody indicated equivalent expression levels for each of the recombinant proteins. As expected, VEGF treatment robustly augmented native receptor autophosphorylation, In contrast, receptor autophosphorylation, as well as downstream signaling events, were VEGF-independent for cells expressing mutant receptors, I-125-VEGF(165) bound with equal or better affinity to mutant versus native receptor, although the number of radioligand binding sites was significantly reduced because a significant percentage of mutant, but not native, receptors were localized to the cell interior. As was the case for native KDR,I-125-VEGF(165) binding to the mutant receptors was dependent upon cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and I-125-VEGF(121) bound with an affinity equal to that of I-125-VEGF(165) to the native and mutant receptors. It is concluded that KDR Ig-like domains 4-7 contain structural features that inhibit receptor signaling by a mechanism that is independent of neuropilin-1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. We speculate that this provides a cellular mechanism for blocking unwanted signaling events in the absence of VEGF.

Methods-The density and affinity of beta (2) adrenergic receptors (beta 2R) on CD19+ lymphocytes in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and systemic sclerosis (SSc), as well as intracellular cAMP levels in patients with RA and SLE, were determined. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated from venous blood of patients and healthy controls by Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation. CD19+ lymphocytes were purified by magnetic cell sorting, and beta 2R were determined by a radioligand binding assay with [I-125]iodocyanopindolol. Intracellular cAMP levels and beta 2R agonist induced cell death were measured by a radioimmunoassay and flow cytometry using annexin-V binding, respectively. Systemic disease activity of the patients was evaluated using multifactorial scoring systems. Results-The density of beta 2R on peripheral CD19+ lymphocytes was significantly decreased in patients with RA, SLE, and SSc compared with healthy controls. In patients with RA and SSc beta 2R density was negatively correlated with systemic disease activity. Furthermore, although basal intracellular cAMP levels were raised in patients with RA and SLE, the increase of cAMP upon stimulation of beta 2R was significantly reduced in these patients compared with control subjects. Preliminary data suggest that beta 2R agonist induced cell death is diminished in patients with RA exhibiting decreased beta 2R densities. Conclusions-The results of this study show a reduction of beta 2R densities on B lymphocytes mirrored by an impaired intracellular cAMP generation in patients with chronic rheumatic diseases, indicating a decreased influence of the autonomic nervous system on B cells in these conditions.

Removal of the isopropylidene acetal and subsequent acetylation gave the central disaccharide 1,2,3',4'-tetra-O-acetylQ-2',5,6'-tri-O-benzyl-3-O-alpha -D-glucopyranosyl-D-ribofuranose. Vorbruggen condensation with activated imidazole or purine gave the required P-substituted derivatives which were further elaborated to 7 and 8, respectively. Radioligand binding assays to hepatic InsP(3) receptors and functional assays of Ca2+ release from permeabilized hepatocytes gave a rank order of potency of the ligands 2 approximate to 8 > 7 approximate to Ins(1,4,5)P-3 indicating that the N-6-amino group of 2 is of little importance for activity and that a minimum of a two-fused-ring nucleobase is required for activity to exceed that of Ins(1,4,5)P-3. The role of the adenine base in the activity of the adenophostins is discussed. This general method should facilitate ready access to nucleobase-modified adenophostin analogues for SAR studies.

Further structural manipulation was guided by molecular modeling through comparison of fieldpoint-based structures of candidate compounds with a selected low-energy conformation of the representative CCK2 receptor antagonist 5-[[[(1S)-[[(3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)-amino]carbonyl]-2-phenylethyl]amino]carbonyl]-6-[[(1-adamantylmethyl)amino]carbonyl]indole (JB93182 (3)).

Compound 32 behaved as a competitive CCK2 receptor antagonist in vitro as judged by its inhibition of pentagastrin-stimulated acid secretion in an isolated, lumen-perfused, immature rat stomach assay (pK(B) = 6.74 +/- 0.27) and by its displacement of [I-125]CCK-8S from CCK2 sites in mouse cortical homogenates (pK(i) = 6.99 +/- 0.05). Compound 32 was 100-fold selective for CCK2 over CCK1 receptors based on the affinity estimate obtained in a guinea pig pancreas radioligand binding assay (pK(i) = 5.0).

Herein, we exploited the pro-tein superglue (i.e. SpyTag-SpyCatcher chemistry) for site-specific, oriented, and in-situ one-step beta2-adrenoceptor (fi2-AR) immobilization. SpyCatcher was used as a fusion tag at the C-terminal of fi2-AR and the macroporous silica gels were functionalized with the SpyTag peptide. Immobilization was real-ized by immersing the gels into the E.coli cell lysate containing fi2-AR-SpyCatcher. Characterization of the functionalized gels was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. Ad-sorption energy distribution calculation, injection amount dependent analysis (IADA) and nonlinear chro-matographic were used for receptor-ligand interaction analysis. The affinity rank order of four ligands to the receptor was tulobuterol > chlorprenaline > salbutamol > terbutaline, which showed highly consistent with data from the radioligand binding assay and the fi2-AR column prepared by HaloTag technology. Magnolol and honokiol were screened from Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis and proved to promote the ex-pression of the receptor in human airway smooth muscle cells. Our work unraveled the great potential to generate good bioactivity of the immobilized fi2-AR through Spy toolbox. This technology can be ex-tended to the immobilization of other functional proteins, providing a better alternative in the field of bioanalysis, biosensing, and separation science.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

Click Chemistry-Enabled Conjugation Strategy for Producing Dibenzodiazepinone-Type Fluorescent Probes To Target M2 Acetylcholine Receptors	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article; Early Access							ALLOSTERIC MODULATION; GROWING APPLICATIONS; LIGAND-BINDING; ANTAGONIST; M-2; SUBTYPE; AGONIST; NODE	The development of fluorescently labeled receptor-targeting compounds represents a powerful pharmacological tool to study and characterize ligand-receptor interactions. Despite significant advances in developing sub-type-specific antagonists for muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), reports on antagonists feasible for click chemistry are less common. Here, we designed and synthesized an antagonist suitable for probe attachment through click chemistry, namely, dibenzodiazepinone (DIBA)-alkyne, based on a previously reported DIBA scaffold with a high binding affinity to type-2 mAChR (M2R). To demonstrate the versatility of DIBA-alkyne as a building block for bioconjugates, we assembled DIBA-alkyne with Cyanine5 fluorophores (Cy5) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) biomolecules to obtain fluorescent DIBA antagonist (DIBA-Cy5) and fluorescent DIBA PEG derivatives. Flow cytometric analysis showed that DIBA-Cy5 possessed a high binding affinity to M2R (Kd = 1.80 nM), a two-order magnitude higher binding affinity than M1R. Fluorescent DIBA PEG derivatives maintained a potent binding to the M2R (Kd <= 4 nM), confirmed by confocal microscopic imaging. Additionally, DIBA-Cy5 can serve as a fluorescent ligand in the receptor-ligand competitive binding assay for other mAChR ligands, an attractive alternative to the traditional radioligand-based assay. The competitive binding mode between DIBA-Cy5 and orthosteric antagonist atropine/allosteric modulator LY2119620 indicated a dualsteric binding mode of the DIBA-type antagonist to M2R. Lastly, we demonstrated the direct staining of DIBA-Cy5 to M2R receptors in the sinoatrial node of a mouse heart. The adaptability of the clickable DIBA antagonist to a wide range of fluorophores and biomolecules can facilitate its use in various biomedical applications such as binding assays that screen compounds for M2R as the receptor target.

We examined the relationship between dopamine transporter (DAT) loss using kit-based Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 (DAT single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) radioligand) and globus pallidus necrosis on MRI, DAT availability before and after hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT), and feasibility of Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 as an index for parkinsonian syndrome in CO poisoning. Methods: Twenty-one CO-intoxicated patients (mean +/- SD age, 38.6 +/- 11.4; range, 20-68 years) with DNS underwent Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 SPECT and MRI before HBOT and follow-up Tc-99m-TRODAT-1 SPECT to assess DAT recovery. Neurological examinations for Parkinsonism were performed after development of DNS. Results: Over 70% (15/21) of DNS patients showed globus pallidus necrosis on MRI. Significantly lower bilateral striatal DAT availability was associated with globus pallidus necrosis (p < 0.005). Moreover, 68.4% (13/19) of DNS subjects with Parkinsonian syndrome had lower bilateral striatal DAT availability vs. non-parkinsonian subjects pre- or post-HBOT. The SURs for both striata increased by similar to 11% post-HBOT in the Parkinsonian group; however, the left striatum presented a significantly higher DAT recovery rate than the right (*** p < 0.005). Conclusions: Coupled Tc-99m TRODAT-1 SPECT and MRI could assist evaluation of Parkinsonism risk and indicate DAT availability after HBOT in CO-poisoned patients with DNS.

Individuals with higher aerobic fitness report greater exercise-induced mood improvements than those with lower fitness, but the link between cardiorespiratory fitness and the MOR system remains unresolved. Here we tested whether maximal oxygen uptake (V?O-2peak) and physical activity level are associated with cerebral MOR availability and whether these phenotypes predict endogenous opioid release after a session of exercise. Methods We studied 64 healthy lean men who performed a maximal incremental cycling test for V?O-2peak determination, completed a questionnaire assessing moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA; in minutes per week), and underwent positron emission tomography with [C-11]carfentanil, a specific radioligand for MOR. A subset of 24 subjects underwent additional positron emission tomography scan also after a 1-h session of moderate-intensity exercise and 12 of them also after a bout of high-intensity interval training. Results Higher self-reported MVPA level predicted greater opioid release after high-intensity interval training, and both V?O-2peak and MVPA level were associated with a larger decrease in cerebral MOR binding after aerobic exercise in the ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, and insula. That is, more trained individuals showed greater opioid release acutely after exercise in brain regions especially relevant for reward and cognitive processing. Fitness was not associated with MOR availability. Conclusions We conclude that regular exercise training and higher aerobic fitness may induce neuroadaptation within the MOR system, which might contribute to improved emotional and behavioral responses associated with long-term exercise.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is known to induce reactive astrogliosis in the lesion site. This is a first report to examine the spatial and temporal changes in reactive astrogliosis as evaluated by F-18-THK5351 after a severe TBI. Case presentation A 27-year-old man suffering from a severe TBI with multiple brain contusions was examined using F-18-THK5351 PET/CT in the subacute and chronic phases after the injury. The first PET scan, performed 46 days after the TBI, showed intense uptake of F-18-THK5351 in and around the brain contusions. The second PET scan, performed 271 days after the TBI, showed reduced uptake of F-18-THK5351 at the original sites of the brain contusions and increased uptakes in the white matter surrounding the contusions and the corpus callosum. The patient exhibited sustained improvement of neuropsychological impairment between the two PET examinations and remarkable recovery from the severe TBI. Conclusions There were evident temporal and spatial changes in F-18-THK5351 uptake in the traumatized brain between the two PET examinations. These changes may have been related to the remarkable neurological recovery in this patient. The degree and distribution of reactive astrogliosis detected by F-18-THK5351 PET may be useful in assessing pathophysiology and predicting prognosis in TBI patients.

To reach these, brain uptake is imperative, and it is therefore important to understand the molecular mechanisms of NCS-382 transport in order to direct in vivo studies. In this study, we hypothesized that NCS-382 is a substrate for the monocarboxylate transporter subtype 1 (MCT1) which is known to mediate blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation of GHB. For this purpose, we investigated NCS-382 uptake by MCT subtypes endogenously expressed in tsA201 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines in assays of radioligand-based competition and fluorescence-based intracellular pH measurements. To further verify the results, we measured NCS-382 uptake by means of mass spectrometry in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing MCT subtypes. As expected, we found that NCS-382 is a substrate for MCT1 with half-maximal effective concentrations in the low millimolar range. Surprisingly, NCS-382 also showed substrate activity at MCT4 as well as uptake in water-injected oocytes, suggesting a component of passive diffusion. In conclusion, transport of NCS-382 across membranes differs from GHB as it also involves MCT4 and/or passive diffusion. This should be taken into consideration when designing pharmacological studies with this compound and its closely related analogues. The combination of MCT assays used here exemplifies a setup that may be suitable for a reliable characterization of MCT ligands in general.

In drug-naive patients with schizophrenia, the findings have been inconsistent, with decreases, increases, and no change in the frontal cortex D-1-dopamine receptors. While these discrepancies are likely primarily due to a lack of statistical power in these studies, we speculated that an additional explanation may be the differences due to methods of image analysis between studies, affecting reliability as well as bias between groups. Methods: Fifteen healthy subjects underwent two PET measurements with [C-11] SCH23390 on the same day. The binding potential (BPND) was compared using a 95% confidence interval following manual and automated delineation of a region of interest (ROI) as well as with and without frame-by-frame realignment. Results: Automated target region delineation produced lower BPND values, while automated delineation of the reference region yielded higher BPND values. However, no significant differences were observed for repeatability using automated and manual delineation methods. Frame-by-frame realignment generated higher BPND values and improved repeatability. Conclusions: The results suggest that the choice of ROI delineation method is not an important factor for reliability, whereas the improved results following movement correction confirm its importance in PET image analysis. Realignment is therefore especially important for measurements in patient populations such as schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease, where motion artifacts may be more prevalent.

Duloxetine, a serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of patients with SUI in some European countries, but not in the United States. There is currently no globally approved pharmacological drug for the treatment of patients with SUI. Therefore, a new pharmacological treatment option is required. TAS-303 [4-piperidinyl 2,2-diphenyl-2-(propoxy-1,1,2,2,3,3,3-day(7))acetate hydrochloride] is a novel small-molecule selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that displays significant norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitory activity toward the serotonin or dopamine transporters. In this report, we describe the pharmacological properties of TAS-303 and its effects on urethral function, using preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies. Radioligand-binding studies showed that TAS-303 selectively and potently inhibited [H-3]norepinephrine binding to the human NET. Oral administration of TAS-303 (3 mg/kg) significantly increased norepinephrine levels in the plasma, whereas it did not significantly affect epinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin levels. TAS-303 (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg) dose-dependently increased basal urethral pressure in normal rats and leak point pressure in vaginal distention rats, exhibiting a maximal effect comparable to duloxetine. In the forced swimming test, TAS-303 (100 mg/kg) showed no significant effects on immobility time in rats, raising the possibility that this agent would have minimal central nervous system side effects at an effective dose for urethral function. These results demonstrate that TAS-303 has therapeutic potential for the treatment of patients with SUI.

A binding kinetics study of human adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor agonists	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Residence time; Structure-kinetics relationships; Adenosine A(3) receptor; Binding kinetics; Nucleosides	TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; STRUCTURE-AFFINITY RELATIONSHIPS; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; DISSOCIATION; NUCLEOSIDES; DERIVATIVES; LIGANDS; A(1); DESENSITIZATION; CONSTANT	The human adenosine A(3) (hA(3)) receptor has been suggested as a viable drug target in inflammatory diseases and in cancer. So far, a number of selective hA(3) receptor agonists (e.g. IB-MECA and 2-CI-IB-MECA) inducing anti-inflammatory or anticancer effects are under clinical investigation. Drug-target binding kinetics is increasingly recognized as another pharmacological parameter, next to affinity, for compound triage in the early phases of drug discovery. However, such a kinetics-driven analysis has not yet been performed for the hA3 receptor. In this study, we first validated a competition association assay for adenosine A3 receptor agonists to determine the target interaction kinetics. Affinities and Kinetic Rate Index (KRI) values of 11 ribofurano and 10 methanocarba nucleosides were determined in radioligand binding assays. Afterwards, 15 analogues were further selected (KRI <0.70 or KRI >1.35) for full kinetics characterization. The structure-kinetics relationships (SKR) were derived and longer residence times were associated with methanocarba and enlarged adenine N-6 and C2 substitutions. In addition, from a k(on)-k(off)K(D) kinetic map we divided the agonists into three subgroups. A residence time "cliff' was observed, which might be relevant to (N)-methanocarba derivatives' rigid C2-arylalkynyl substitutions. Our findings provide substantial evidence that, next to affinity, additional knowledge of binding kinetics is useful for developing and selecting new hA(3)R agonists in the early phase of the drug discovery process.

In this respect, among glutamatergic receptors special attention is paid to the group II of metabotropic glutamatergic receptors (mGlu2/3R) which are involved in the transition from drug use to drug addiction including the relapse mechanisms. Methods: The present study employed radioligand binding and Western blot assays to study mGlu2/3R density, affinity and protein expression in selected rat brain areas after cocaine self-administration, extinction training and cocaine-induced reinstatement. Rats were randomly assigned in triads to one of three conditions: contingent cocaine intravenous self-administration, non-contingent injections of cocaine (yoked cocaine), or saline yoked to the intake of the self-administering subject. Results: Cocaine self-administration and yoked cocaine delivery resulted in a significant increase in the mGlu2/3R density in the prefrontal cortex and the dorsal striatum, while 10-day extinction training provoked a reduction in the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens. Cocaine abstinence also enhanced an increase in the [H-3]ligand binding to mGlu2/3R in the prefrontal cortex. During reinstatement the cocaine challenge dose (10 mg/kg, ip) led to important elevation in the mGlu2/3R density in the prefrontal cortex. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated the role of mGlu2/3R localized in the prefrontal cortex-striatum pathways to cocaine repeated exposure.

The basis for its reduced dysphoric effect compared to other KOR agonists is not clear, but prior studies suggest that the aversive properties of KOR agonists require p38 alpha MAPK activation through an arrestin-dependent mechanism. To determine whether nalfurafine is a functionally selective KOR agonist, we measured its potency to activate the G protein-dependent early phase of Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK1/2) phosphorylation and the arrestin-dependent late phase of p38 MAPK signaling. Nalfurafine was approximately 250 fold more potent for ERK1/2 activation as compared to p38 MAPK activation in human KOR (hKOR) expressing HEK293 cells, and approximately 20 fold more potent for ERK1/2 activation than p38 activation in rodent KOR (rKOR) expressing HEK293 cells. The 10-fold greater G-bias at the hKOR than rKOR was unexpected, however the G protein biased effect of nalfurafine is consistent with its reduced dysphoric effects in human and rodent models. Although nalfurafine is reported to have low receptor selectivity in radioligand binding assays, its antinociceptive effect was blocked by the selective KOR antagonist norbinaltorphimine. Nalfurafine pretreatment also resulted in a KOR-dependent and mu opioid receptor independent reduction in scratching induced by 5'-GNTI. These findings suggest that nalfurafine is a functionally selective KOR agonist and that KOR agonists able to selectively activate G protein signaling without activating p38 alpha MAPK may have therapeutic potential as non-dysphoric antipruritic analgesics.

AZD7325 and AZD6280 are novel, subtype-selective GABA(A alpha 2,3) receptor positive modulators with limited sedative effects. The current study aimed to confirm target engagement at GABA(A) receptors by AZD7325 and AZD6280 in humans and to determine the relationship between exposure, GABA(A) receptor occupancy, and tolerability. Two PET studies, using high-resolution research tomography (HRRT) and the radioligand [C-11]flumazenil, were performed in 12 subjects at baseline and after administration of single oral doses of AZD7325 (0.2 to 30 mg) and AZD6280 (5 to 40 mg). PET images were analyzed using a simplified reference tissue model, and regional binding potentials (BPND) were obtained. The relationship between plasma concentration of AZD7325 or AZD6280 and GABA(A) receptor occupancy was described by hyperbolic function, and K (i,plasma) (plasma concentration required for 50% receptor occupancy) was estimated. Assessments of safety and tolerability included recording of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests. The [C-11]flumazenil binding was reduced in a dose-dependent, saturable manner by both agents. Maximum receptor occupancy could be reached for both compounds without causing sedation or cognitive impairment. The K (i,plasma) estimates for AZD7325 and AZD6280 were 15 and 440 nmol/l, respectively. High GABA(A) receptor occupancy by AZD7325 and AZD6280 could be reached without clear sedative effects.

Pretargeted PET Imaging Using a Site-Specifically Labeled Immunoconjugate	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GLCNAC-MODIFIED PROTEINS; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY A33; ALDER CLICK CHEMISTRY; IN-VIVO CHEMISTRY; BIOORTHOGONAL CHEMISTRY; COLORECTAL-CARCINOMA; BISPECIFIC ANTIBODY; DRUG CONJUGATION; TUMOR UPTAKE; N-GLYCANS	In recent years, both site-specific bioconjugation techniques and bioorthogonal pretargeting strategies have emerged as exciting technologies with the potential to improve the safety and efficacy of antibody-based nuclear imaging. In the work at hand, we have combined these two approaches to create a pretargeted PET imaging strategy based on the rapid and bioorthogonal inverse electron demand :Diels-Alder reaction between a Cu-64-labeled tetrazine radioligand (Cu-64-Tz-SarAr) and a site-specifically modified huA33-trans-cyclooctene immunoconjugate ((ss)huA33-PEG(12)-TCO). A bioconjugation strategy that harnesses enzymatic transformations and strain-promoted azide-alkyne click chemistry was used to site-specifically append PEGylated TCO moieties to the heavy chain glycans of the colorectal cancer-targeting huA33 antibody. Preclinical in vivo validation studies were performed in athymic nude mice bearing A33 antigen-expressing SW1222 human colorectal carcinoma xenografts. To this end, mice were administered (ss)huA33-PEG(12)-TCO via tail vein injection and following accumulation intervals of 24 or 48 h-Cu-64-Tz-SarAr. PET imaging and biodistribution studies reveal that this strategy clearly delineates tumor tissue as early as 1 h post-injection (6.7 +/- 1.7%ID/g at 1 h p.i.), producing images with excellent contrast and high tumor-to-background activity concentration ratios (tumor:muscle = 21.5 +/- 5.6 at 24 h p.i.). Furthermore, dosimetric calculations illustrate that this pretargeting approach produces only a fraction of the overall effective dose (0.0214 mSv/MBq; 0.079 rem/mCi) of directly labeled radioimmunoconjugates. Ultimately, this method effectively facilitates the high contrast pretargeted PET imaging of colorectal carcinoma using a site-specifically modified immunoconjugate.

The aim was to evaluate the agreement of pathological diagnosis for coeliac disease in children investigated at four major paediatric university hospitals in Sweden. Materials and methods Intestinal duodenal biopsies were collected from 402 children at median 9.7 years (1.4-18.3 years). A pathologist at each hospital performed the primary evaluation. A designated pathologist, blinded to the primary evaluation, performed a second Marsh classification of biopsies (M0 to M3c) taken from the bulb and duodenum separately. Kappa () scores between first and second evaluation determined the agreement. Plasma samples were collected at the day of intestinal biopsy and analysed for tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies (tTGA) using radioligand-binding assays. Results Marsh scores were concordant in 229/356 biopsies (64%, =0.52, p<0.0001). Among discordant results, 15/127 (12%) showed M0 in distal duodenum but M2 in the bulb, whereas the opposite was true for 8/127 (6%) of the biopsies. There were fewer collected duodenal biopsies, more missing bulb biopsies and missing CD3 staining among discordant evaluations. The second evaluation revealed a Marsh score compliant with coeliac disease in 22 children of whom seven children were tTGA positive. Conclusions The variation between university hospitals on the pathological evaluation of biopsies may lead to misdiagnosis of coeliac disease in paediatric patients. Access to clinical and endoscopic information as well as tTGA levels may be useful for the pathologist to complement the evaluation in dubious cases.

Imaging the serotonergic system could improve diagnosis and therapy of multiple canine behavioural disorders. Furthermore, as many similarities are reported between several human neuropsychiatric conditions and naturally occurring canine behavioural disorders, making this tracer available for use in dogs also provide researchers an interesting non-primate animal model to investigate human disorders. Five adult beagles underwent a 90 minutes dynamic PET scan and arterial whole blood was sampled throughout the scan. For each ROI, the distribution volume (V-T), obtained via the one-and two-tissue compartment model (1-TC, 2-TC) and the Logan Plot, was calculated and the goodness-of-fit was evaluated by the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For the preferred compartmental model BPND values were estimated and compared with those derived by four reference tissue models: 4-parameter RTM, SRTM2, MRTM2 and the Logan reference tissue model. The 2-TC model indicated in 61% of the ROIs a better fit compared to the 1-TC model. The Logan plot produced almost identical VT values and can be used as an alternative. Compared with the 2-TC model, all investigated reference tissue models showed high correlations but small underestimations of the BPND-parameter. The highest correlation was achieved with the Logan reference tissue model (Y = 0.9266 x + 0.0257; R-2 = 0.9722). Therefore, this model can be put forward as a non-invasive standard model for future PET-experiments with [C-11] DASB in dogs.

Michael			Chronic stress alters concentrations of corticosterone receptors in a tissue-specific manner in wild house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; Glucocorticoids; Peripheral receptors; Bird	CHRONIC PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTORS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; BINDING-SITES; BASE-LINE; IN-VIVO; MUSCLE; PLASMA; BRAIN; RESPONSES	The physiological stress response results in release of glucocorticoid hormones such as corticosterone (CORT). Whereas short-term activation of this response helps animals cope with environmental stressors, chronic activation can result in negative effects including metabolic dysregulation and reproductive failure. However, there is no consensus hormonal profile of a chronically stressed animal, suggesting that researchers may need to look beyond hormone titers to interpret the impacts of chronic stress. In this study, we brought wild house sparrows (Passer domesticus) into captivity. We then compared glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptor concentrations in sparrows exposed either to a standardized chronic stress protocol (n=26) or to standard husbandry conditions (controls; n=20). We used radioligand binding assays to quantify receptors in whole brain, liver, kidneys, spleen, gonads, gastrocnemius and pectoralis muscle, omental and subcutaneous fat, and bib and back skin. In most tissues, CORT receptors did not differ between controls and stressed animals, although we found marginal increases in receptor density in kidney and testes in stressed birds at some time points. Only in pectoralis muscle was there a robust effect of chronic stress, with both receptor types higher in stressed animals. Increased pectoralis sensitivity to CORT with chronic stress may be part of the underlying mechanism for muscle wasting in animals administered exogenous CORT. Furthermore, the change in pectoralis was not paralleled by gastrocnemius receptors. This difference may help explain previous reports of a greater effect of CORT on pectoralis than on other muscle types, and indicate that birds use this muscle as a protein reserve.

Flow cytometric microsphere-based immunoassay as a novel non-radiometric method for the detection of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies in type 1 diabetes mellitus	ANALYST			English	Article							LINKED IMMUNOSORBENT ASSAYS; SENSITIVE NONISOTOPIC ASSAY; GAD65 AUTOANTIBODIES; INSULIN-ANTIBODIES; PROTEINS; BINDING; MARKERS; ONSET; IDDM	The firstmeasurable sign of arising autoimmunity in type 1 diabetesmellitus is the detection of autoantibodies against beta-cell antigens, such as glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65). GAD65 autoantibodies (GADA) are usually measured by the Radioligand Binding Assay (RBA). The aim of this work was to develop protocols of flow cytometric microsphere-based immunoassays (FloCMIA) which involved glutamic acid decarboxylase fused to thioredoxin (TrxGAD65) adsorbed on polystyrene microspheres. Detection of bound GADA was accomplished by the use of anti-human IgG-Alexa Fluor 488 (protocol A), anti-human IgG-biotin and streptavidin-dichlorotriazinyl aminofluorescein (DTAF) (protocol B) or TrxGAD65-biotin and streptavidin-DTAF (protocol C). Serum samples obtained from 46 patients assayed for routine autoantibodies at Servicios Tecnologicos de Alto Nivel (STAN-CONICET) were analyzed by RBA, ELISA and three alternative FloCMIA designs. Protocol C exhibited the highest specificity (97.8%) and sensitivity (97.4%) and a wide dynamic range (1.00-134.40 SDs). Samples obtained from 40 new-onset diabetic patients were also analyzed to further evaluate the performance of protocol C. The latter protocol showed a sensitivity of 58.6% and a prevalence of 47.5%. Two patients resulted positive only by FloCMIA protocol C and its SDs were higher than those of RBA and ELISA, showing a significantly wide dynamic range. In conclusion, FloCMIA proved to be highly sensitive and specific, requiring a low sample volume; it is environmentally adequate, innovative and represents a cost-effective alternative to traditional GADA determination by RBA and/or ELISA, making it applicable to most medium-complexity laboratories.

We studied the expression and functional properties of the receptor in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from non-traumatized healthy individuals (healthy controls; n = 85), and war trauma-exposed individuals with current PTSD (n = 113), with life-time PTSD (n = 61) and without PTSD (trauma controls; n = 88). The aim of the study was to distinguish the receptor alterations related to PTSD from those related to trauma itself or to resilience to PTSD. Methods: Functional status of the receptor was assessed by radioligand binding and lysozyme synthesis inhibition assays. The level of GR gene expression was measured by quantitative PCR and immunoblotting. Results: Current PTSD patients had the lowest, while trauma controls had the highest number of glucocorticoid binding sites (B-max) in PBMCs. Hormone-binding potential (B-max/K-D ratio) of the receptor was diminished in the current PTSD group in comparison to all other study groups. Correlation between B-max and K-D that normally exists in healthy individuals was decreased in the current PTSD group. Contrasting B-max data, GR protein level was lower in trauma controls than in participants with current or life-time PTSD. Conclusions: Current PTSD is characterized by reduced lymphocyte GR hormone-binding potential and by disturbed compensation between B-max and hormone-binding affinity. Resilience to PTSD is associated with enlarged fraction of the receptor molecules capable of hormone binding, within the total receptor molecule population in PBMCs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

[<SUP>3</SUP>H]IVDE77, a novel radioligand with high affinity and selectivity for the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Angiotensin IV; IVDE77; Insulin-regulated aminopeptidase; IRAP; AT(1) receptor; Aminopeptidase N	AT(4) RECEPTOR-LIGAND; ANGIOTENSIN-IV; CYSTINYL AMINOPEPTIDASE; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; INTACT-CELLS; BINDING-SITE; INHIBITORS; AT(1); IRAP; PEPTIDE	The hexapeptide angiotensin IV (Ang IV) induces diverse biological effects such as memory enhancement and protection against ischemic stroke. Studies on the mechanism of Ang IV however are hampered by its instability and its lack of selectivity. The high-affinity binding site for Ang IV is the insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP, EC 3.4.11.3), but Mg IV also acts as a weak agonist for the Ang II-receptor (AT(1)), implying the need for stable and highly selective Mg IV-analogues. Here we present the screening of novel Mg IV-analogues, selected on basis of high affinity for IRAP, high selectivity (compared to aminopeptidase N and the AT(1), receptor) and resistance against proteases. The selected compound IVDE77 possesses a number of advantages compared to Ang IV: (i) it has a 40 times higher affinity for IRAP (K-i 1.71 nM), (ii) it does not activate the AT(1), receptor, (iii) it is easily radiolabeled with tritium and (iv) it is resistant to proteolysis, even in human plasma. In addition, pre-treatment of intact CHO-K1 cells with IVDE77 led to a virtually complete inhibition of subsequent intracellular accumulation of [H-3]IVDE77-IRAP complexes. IVDE77 thus represents the first Ang IV-analogue able to abolish IRAP-availability completely at the cell surface in vitro. In summary, IVDE77 is a useful tool for the detection of IRAP under physiological conditions, and may contribute to elucidating the mechanism of Ang IV to ascertain which functions are IRAP-dependent.

Methods: The muscarinic receptor in homogenates of human tissues (bladder mucosa and detrusor muscle and parotid gland) was measured using a radioligand binding assay with [N-methyl-(3)H] scopolamine methyl chloride ([(3)H]NMS). Results: Imidafenacin competed with [3H] NMS for binding sites in the bladder mucosa and detrusor muscle and parotid gland, and its affinity was significantly (2.6-8.7 times) higher than that of oxybutynin. Also, the affinity of imidafenacin for muscarinic receptors was approximately two-fold higher in the parotid gland than bladder tissue. The affinity of imidafenacin in the mucosa was similar to that in the detrusor muscle, suggesting that this agent exhibits therapeutic effects by blocking muscarinic receptors in the mucosa as well as detrusor muscle. Scatchard analysis revealed that imidafenacin increased significantly (approximately four-fold) K(d) values for [(3)H] NMS binding in the human detrusor muscle and parotid gland, with little effect on B(max) values. This observation indicates that imidafenacin binds to the muscarinic receptors in human tissues in a competitive and reversible manner. Conclusion: Imidafenacin binds to muscarinic receptors in the human bladder mucosa and detrusor muscle and parotid gland with high affinity. This agent was considered to exhibit therapeutic effects on the lower urinary tract symptoms due to an overactive bladder by blocking muscarinic receptors in the urothelium as well as detrusor muscle.

Clomipramine, a tricyclic antidepressant, has been reported to have an active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine, which has high affinity for NET in vitro. However, the NET occupancy of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine has not fully been evaluated in vivo. In this positron emission tomography (PET) study, we investigate NET occupancy by clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine, respectively, in non-human primates with a selective radioligand for NET, (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2. PET measurements were performed with (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 at baseline and after the intravenous administration of clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine, respectively. NET binding was calculated with the simplified reference tissue model using the caudate as reference region. NET occupancy was calculated as the difference in NET binding between the baseline and pretreatment condition. The relationship between NET occupancy and dose/plasma concentration was evaluated using hyperbolic functions. NET occupancy by both clomipramine and desmethylclomipramine increased in a dose and plasma concentration-dependent manner. The mean Kd values, expressed as the dose or plasma concentration at which 50% of NET was occupied, were 0.44 mg/kg and 24.5 ng/ml for clomipramine and 0.11 mg/kg and 4.4 ng/ml for desmethylclomipramine. Not only desmethylclomipramine but also clomipramine was demonstrated to occupy NET in the non-human primate in vivo. It can thus be assumed that NET occupancy during clinical treatment with clomipramine is a combined effect of unchanged clomipramine and its main metabolite desmethylclomipramine.

Therefore, the present study aimed to characterize such specific target sites for opioids in intracardiac ganglia, which act as a complex network for the integration of the heart's neuronal in- and output. Tissue samples from rat heart atria were subjected to RT-PCR, Western blot, radioligand-binding, and double immunofluorescence confocal analysis of mu (M)- and kappa (K)-opioid receptors (ORs) with the neuronal markers vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and substance P (SP). Our results demonstrated MOR- and KOR-specific mRNA, receptor protein, and selective membrane ligand binding. By using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, MOR and KOR immunoreactivity were colocalized with VAChT in large-diameter parasympathetic principal neurons, with TH-immunoreactive small intensely fluorescent (SIF) cells, and on nearby TH-IR varicose terminals. In addition, MOR and KOR immunoreactivity were identified on CGRP- and SP-IR sensory neurons throughout intracardiac ganglia and atrial myocardium. Our findings show that MOR and KOR are expressed as mRNA and translated into specific receptor proteins on cardiac parasympathetic, sympathetic, and sensory neurons as potential binding sites for opioids. Thus, they may well play a role within the complex network for the integration of the heart's neuronal in- and output. J. Comp. Neurol. 518:3836-3847, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Synthetic Lapachol Derivatives Relax Guinea-Pig Ileum by Blockade of the Voltage-Gated Calcium Channels	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR NATURFORSCHUNG SECTION C-A JOURNAL OF BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						Synthetic Lapachol Derivatives; Guinea-Pig Ileum; Ca-v	SMOOTH-MUSCLE; BETA-LAPACHONE; INTERNATIONAL-UNION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; TRYPANOSOMA-CRUZI; ALPHA-LAPACHONE; BAY-K-8644; ACTIVATOR; NAPHTHOQUINONES	The present study was designed to further evaluate a possible spasmolytic activity of synthetic lapachol derivatives, norlapachol, alpha-norlapachone, beta-norlapachone and hydro-hydroxy-norlapachol (HH-norlapachol), on guinea-pig ileum. In guinea-pig ileum, except for norlapachol, all naphthoquinones inhibited the phasic contractions induced by carbachol or histamine. Even when the ileum was pre-contracted with KCl, carbachol or histamine, all naphthoquinones induced relaxation, suggesting that these naphthoquinones could be acting on the voltage-gated calcium channels (Ca-v). As the tonic component this contraction is maintained mainly by the opening of the Ca-v, we hypothesized that these naphthoquinones might be acting on these channels. This hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that norlapachol (pD'(2) = 4.99), alpha-norlapachone (pD'(2) = 4.49), beta-norlapachone (pD'(2) = 6.33), and HH-norlapachol (pD'(2)= 4.53) antagonized the contractions induced by CaCl2 in depolarizing medium nominally without Ca2+. As beta-norlapachone was the most potent we decided to continue the study of its action mechanism. The fact that this naphthoquinone has inhibited the tonic contractions induced by S-(-)-Bay K8644 [EC50 = (1.6 +/- 0.30) . 10(-5) M] suggests that the Ca2+ channel involved belongs to the type L (Ca(v)1.2). In addition, in the functional level, the spasmolytic effect of beta-norlapachone does not involve participation of free radicals, since its curve of relaxation was unchanged in the presence of glutathione, an antioxidant agent.

Here, we assessed the acute seizurogenic potencies of isomers-D, -E and -F and their binding affinities at heterogeneous populations of KA receptors from rat cerebrum. In addition, binding affinities of all six isomers (Iso-A through -F) were assessed at AMPA receptors. Radioligand displacement studies indicated that the seizurogenic potency of Iso-F CE-configuration) closely correlates with its affinities at both KA and AMPA receptors, whereas isomers-D (Z) and -E (E), which exhibit distinctly lower seizurogenic potencies, are quite weak displacers. Previously observed functional potencies for isomers-A, -B and -C (Sawant et al., 2008) correlated with AMPA receptor affinities observed here. Taken together, these findings call into question previous structure-activity rules. Significantly, in our hands, Iso-D was ten-fold less potent than Iso-F. To further explain observed links between structural conformation and functional potency, molecular modeling was employed. Modeling results closely matched the rank order of potency and binding data observed. We further assessed the efficacy of isomers-D, -E and -F as pharmacological preconditioning agents. Acute preconditioning with low-dose Iso-D, -E or -F, before high-dose DA failed to impart behavioural tolerance. This study has shed new light on structural conformations affecting non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor binding and functional potency, and provides a foundation for future work in areas of AMPA and KA receptor modeling.

Reducing modeling error of graphical methods for estimating volume of distribution measurements in PIB-PET study	MATHEMATICAL BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						Bias; Modeling error; Graphical analysis; PET quantification	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; NEURORECEPTOR; QUANTIFICATION; STRATEGIES; PARAMETERS; IMPROVE; TRACER; BIAS	Graphical analysis methods are widely used in positron emission tomography quantification because of their simplicity and model independence. But they may, particularly for reversible kinetics, lead to bias in the estimated parameters. The source of the bias is commonly attributed to noise in the data. Assuming a two-tissue compartmental model, we investigate the bias that originates from modeling error. This bias is an intrinsic property of the simplified linear models used for limited scan durations, and it is exaggerated by random noise and numerical quadrature error. Conditions are derived under which Logan's graphical method either over-or under-estimates the distribution volume in the noise-free case. The bias caused by modeling error is quantified analytically. The presented analysis shows that the bias of graphical methods is inversely proportional to the dissociation rate. Furthermore, visual examination of the linearity of the Logan plot is not sufficient for guaranteeing that equilibrium has been reached. A new model which retains the elegant properties of graphical analysis methods is presented, along with a numerical algorithm for its solution. We perform simulations with the fibrillar amyloid beta radioligand [11C] benzothiazole-aniline using published data from the University of Pittsburgh and Rotterdam groups. The results show that the proposed method significantly reduces the bias due to modeling error. Moreover, the results for data acquired over a 70 min scan duration are at least as good as those obtained using existing methods for data acquired over a 90 min scan duration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Cells isolated from seven glioblastomas (GBM 1-7) and grown using neural stem cell permissive conditions were characterized for in vivo tumorigenicity, expression of tumor stem cell markers (CD133, nestin), and multilineage differentiation properties, confirming that these cultures are enriched in TICs. TIC cultures were challenged with increasing concentrations of erlotinib and gefitinib, and their survival was evaluated after 1-4 days. In most cases, a time- and concentration-dependent cell death was observed, although GBM 2 was completely insensitive to both drugs, and GBM 7 was responsive only to the highest concentrations tested. Using a radioligand binding assay, we show that all GBM TICs express EGFR. Erlotinib and gefitinib inhibited EGFR and ERK1/2 phosphorylation/activation in all GBMs, irrespective of the antiproliferative response observed. However, under basal conditions GBM 2 showed a high Akt phosphorylation that was completely insensitive to both drugs, whereas GBM 7 was completely insensitive to gefitinib, and Akt inactivation occurred only for the highest erlotinib concentration tested, showing a precise relationship with the antiproliferative effects of the drug. Interestingly, in GBM 2, phosphatase and tensin homolog expression was significantly down-regulated, possibly accounting for the insensitivity to the drugs. In conclusion, glioma TICs are responsive to anti-EGFR drugs, but phosphatase and tensin homolog expression and Akt inhibition seem to be necessary for such effect.

Here, we synthesized novel benzothiophene derivatives and labeled them with F-18 for the potential diagnostic imaging of AD patients using positron emission tomography. The K-i values of benzothiophene derivatives were evaluated by competitive binding assay using 2-(3'-[I-125]iodo-4'-N-methylaminophenyl)benzothiazole as a radioligand and A beta(1-40) or A beta(1-42) aggregates as receptors. All synthesized benzothiophene derivatives showed high binding affinities (K-i=0.28-6.50 nM) to both A beta(1-40) and A beta(1-42) aggregates. Binding affinities were increased by 0-alkylation or N-alkylation of 2-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiophene or 2-(4'-aminophenyl)benzothiophene. Biodistribution studies of 2-(4'-O-(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)hydroxyphenyl)benzothiophene ([F-18]2d) and 2-(4'-O-(3'-[F-18]fluoropropyl)hydroxyphenyl)benzothiophene ([F-18]2d) in normal mice were performed after intravenous injection through the tail vein. In biodistribution data, [F-18]2c and [F-18]2d showed high initial brain uptakes at 2 min (5.2 +/- 0.4% and 3.3 +/- 0.2% ID/g, respectively), and brain activities washed out to 2.0 +/- 0.2% and 0.5 +/- 0.1% ID/g at 4 h, respectively. In conclusion, benzothiophene derivatives showed excellent binding affinities for A beta aggregates and high initial brain uptakes in normal mice. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Comparison of rat dopamine D2 receptor occupancy for a series of antipsychotic drugs measured using radiolabeled or nonlabeled raclopride tracer	LIFE SCIENCES			English	Article						rat; dopamine; D2; receptor occupancy; in vivo binding; striatum; liquid chromatography; mass spectroscopy; chlorpromazine; clozapine; haloperidol; olanzapine; risperidone; spiperone; thioridazine; ziprasidone; raclopride	AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; BINDING	Preclinical brain receptor occupancy measures have heretofore been conducted by quantifying the brain distribution of a radiolabeled tracer ligand using either scintillation spectroscopy or tomographic imaging. For smaller animals like rodents, the majority of studies employ tissue dissection and scintillation spectroscopy. These measurements can also be accomplished using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectral detection to measure the brain distribution of tracer molecules, obviating the need for radioligands. In order to validate mass spectroscopy-based receptor occupancy methods, we examined dopamine D2 receptor dose-occupancy curves for a number of antipsychotic drugs in parallel experiments using either mass spectroscopy or radioligand-based approaches. Oral dose-occupancy curves were generated for 8 antipsychotic compounds in parallel experiments using either radiolabeled or unlabeled racloptide tracer. When curves generated by these two methods were compared and ED50 values determined, remarkably similar data were obtained. Occupancy ED50 values were (mg/kg): chlorpromazine, 5.1 and 2.7; clozapine, 41 and 40-, haloperidol, 0.2 and 0.3; olanzapine, 2.1 and 2.2; risperidone, 0.1 and 0.4; spiperone, 0.5 and 0.4; thioridazine 9.2 and 9.5, and ziprasidone 1.4 and 2.1 (unlabeled and radiolabeled raclopride tracer, respectively). The observation that in vivo application of both techniques led to comparable data adds to the validation state of the mass spectroscopy-based approach to receptor occupancy assays.

Characterization of dopamine-dependent rewarding and locomotor stimulant effects of intravenously-administered methylphenidate in rats	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						dopamine; nucleus accumbens core; nucleus accumbens medial shell; olfactory tubercle; conditioned place preference; cis-flupenthixol	CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE LESIONS; OLFACTORY TUBERCLE; VENTRAL STRIATUM; SHELL SUBREGION; COCAINE REWARD; D-AMPHETAMINE; DRUG-ABUSE; ADDICTION	In general, psychostimulants are thought to exert rewarding and locomotor stimulating effects via increased dopamine transmission in the ventral striatum. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying the effects of the stimulant drug methylphenidate. The present study examined the putative role of dopaminergic transmission in Lv. methylphenidate reward as measured by conditioned place preference. Rats were shown to exhibit conditioned place preference for Lv. methylphenidate (5 mg/kg, not 2 mg/kg). Administration of the dopamine receptor antagonist cis-flupenthixol (0.1-0.8 mg/kg i.p.), either during conditioning or on test day, dose-dependently attenuated the magnitude of the conditioned place preference. Finally, we examined the effects of bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of nucleus accumbens core, medial shell or anteromedial olfactory tubercle on the rewarding and locomotor stimulant effects of methylphenidate. Residual dopamine innervation, as assessed by radioligand binding to the dopamine transporter, revealed a significant association between core dopamine innervation and the locomotor stimulant effect of methylphenidate. However, neither core nor medial shell dopamine innervation was related to conditioned place preference magnitude. Instead, conditioned place preference magnitude was associated with dopamine innervation in the anteromedial olfactory tubercle. These results establish a role for dopaminergic transmission in both Lv. methylphenidate conditioned place preference and locomotor stimulation. As well, they suggest that different ventral striatal subregions mediate the rewarding (anteromedial olfactory tubercle) and locomotor stimulant (accumbens core) effects of methylphenidate.

Such increased responsiveness to acetylcholine (ACh) was not associated with any change in hippocampal acetylcholine or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content, GABAergic inhibition or density of ACh innervation, but was blocked by the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine. We therefore turned to quantitative radioligand binding autoradiography, in situ hybridization and the [S-35]GTP gamma S method to assess the properties of hippocampal and neocortical muscarinic receptors in adult rats having experienced a PTZ seizure at P20. The densities of M1 and M2 receptor binding sites, respectively labeled with [H-3]pirenzepine and [H-3]AFDX-384, as well as the amount of m1, m2 and m3 receptor mRNAs, did not differ from control in the hippocampus and neocortex of these rats. In contrast, in PTZ rats, both brain regions displayed a marked increase in [S-35]GTP gamma S incorporation stimulated by ACh, bethanechol and particularly oxotremorine. This finding indicates that a generalized seizure in immature rat can entail a long-term and presumably permanent increase in the efficacy of G-protein coupling to muscarinic receptors in the hippocampus and neocortex of the adult. By analogy, such a mechanism could account for the susceptibility to epilepsy of human adults having suffered from prolonged convulsions in early life.

The following methods were used: a nonhomogeneous filtration assay in a 96-well format using CHO-AT(1) cell membranes and 2 homogeneous assays, which include the commercially available ScreenReady (TM) Target for the AT(1) receptor and the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) Flashplate((R)), which was coated "in-house" with the CHO-AT(1) cell membranes. Receptors were labeled with [I-125]-Sar(1)-Ile(8)-angiotensin II, and radioligand binding was displaced using the antagonist losartan and the natural agonist angiotensin II. Reproducible K-d, B-max, and K-i values and good total binding/nonspecific binding (TB/NSB) ratios were obtained with both the ScreenReady (TM) Targets and the filtration assay, whereas the WGA Flashplates((R)) showed unacceptably high nonspecific binding and high variation when applied as a homogeneous assay. However, when applied as a heterogeneous assay (i.e., when a wash step at the end of the assay is included), the results were significantly better. Interestingly, ligand affinities were consistently lower in Flashplate((R))-based assays than in the filtration assay. This may be due to the immobilization of the receptors onto the solid surface of the plate, affecting their conformation. In terms of reproducibility, robustness, and feasibility for HTS, the authors conclude that the ScreenReady (TM) Target plates are most suitable for AT, receptor binding screening.

Acute application of L-Phe at concentrations observed in the PKU brain depresses glutamatergic synaptic transmission but does not affect GABA receptor activity in cultured neurons. If these depressant effects of L-Phe take place in the PKU brain, then chronic impairment of the glutamate system, which may contribute to impaired brain function, could be detected as changes in postsynaptic glutamate receptors. This hypothesis was tested by using a combination of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, patch-clamp, radioligand binding and western blot approaches in forebrain tissue from heterozygous and homozygous (PKU) Pah(enu2) mice. Brain concentrations of L-Phe were nearly six-fold greater in PKU mice (863.12 +/- 17.96 mumol/kg) than in their heterozygous counterparts (149.32 +/- 10.23 mumol/kg). This concentration is significantly higher than the K-B of 573 muM for L-Phe to compete for N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Receptor binding experiments with [H-3]MK-801 showed significant up-regulation of NMDA receptor density in PKU mice. Consistent with the depressant effects of L-Phe, expression of NMDA receptor NR2A and (RS)-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor Glu1 and Glu2/3 subunits was significantly increased, whereas expression of the NR2B subunit was decreased. There was no change in GABA alpha1 subunit expression. Given the role of the glutamatergic system in brain development and function, these changes may, at least in part, explain the brain disorders associated with PKU.

Materials and Methods: Intact or ovariectomized female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Two weeks after surgery rats were infused with vehicle (polyethyleneglycol), or estradiol at subphysiological (5 jig daily) or physiological (15 mug daily) concentrations for 14 days using osmotic pumps. Changes in vaginal blood flow elicited by pelvic nerve stimulation were assessed by laser Doppler flowmetry. Total levels of functional estrogen receptor were determined by radioligand binding and Western blot analyses were used to assess estrogen receptor (ER) a protein. Results: Mean plasma estradiol concentration +/-SEM decreased by 63% in the vehicle group (intact 36.5 +/- 10.3 pg/ml). The subphysiological and physiological estradiol groups had plasma levels that were 55% and 83% of the intact group, respectively. Uterine and vaginal wet weight, and vaginal blood flow were significantly decreased in the vehicle group and normalized by physiological levels of estradiol. However, vaginal blood flow was significantly greater in the subphysiological estradiol group compared to intact animals. Specific binding of [H-3] estradiol in vaginal tissue extracts from intact rats was 0.51 fmol/mg protein and it was increased 30-fold in the vehicle group. ER binding in vaginal tissue in the physiological estradiol group decreased to levels that were comparable to those in intact animals, whereas estrogen receptor binding remained elevated in the subphysiological. estradiol group. These changes were paralleled by ERalpha protein levels. Conclusions: Estradiol is crucial for maintaining optimal vaginal blood flow in the rat. Lower levels of plasma estradiol trigger compensatory ERa up-regulation.

We first examined the modulation by PIT of the agonist-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates. PIT blocked 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP)-induced accumulation of inositol phosphates in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells stably expressing human P2Y, receptors in a non-competitive and concentration-dependent manner. The IC50 for reduction of the maximal agonist effect was 0.14 muM. In contrast, MRS2179, a competitive P2Y, receptor antagonist, parallel-shifted the agonist concentration-response curve to the right. PIT also concentration-dependently blocked the P2Y(1) receptor signaling induced by the endogenous agonists, ADP and ATR A simple structural analogue of PIT was synthesized and found to be inactive as a P2Y, receptor antagonist, suggesting that the nitroxyl group of PIT is a necessary structural component for P2Y, receptor antagonism. We next examined the possible modulation of the binding of the newly available antagonist radioligand for the P2Y, receptor, [H-3] MRS2279. It was found that PIT (0.01-10 muM) did not inhibit [H-3] MRS2279 binding to the human P2Y, receptor. PIT (10 muM) had no effect on the competition for [3H] MRS2279 binding by agonists, ADP and ATP, suggesting that its antagonism of the P2Y, receptor may be allosteric. PIT had no significant effect on agonist activation of other P2Y receptors, including P2Y(2), P2Y(4), P2Y(6), P2Y(11) and P2Y(12) receptors. Thus, PIT selectively and non-competitively blocked P2Y(1) receptor signaling without affecting nucleotide binding. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Selective radioligand binding to D-4 receptors was virtually absent in D-4 receptor knockout mouse brain in contrast to significant specific D-4 binding in forebrain tissue of wild-type controls. Labeling of D-1 receptors was significantly increased in nucleus accumbens (NAc; 39%) and caudate putamen (CPu; 42%) of D-4-knockout mice vs wild-type controls. In addition, NMDA receptor labeling was significantly increased in NAc (31%), CPu (40%), and hippocampal CA(1) (21%) and CA(3) (25%) regions of D-4 knockouts vs wild-type controls. No changes in D-2, AMPA or KA receptors were found. The findings suggest that D-1, D-4, and NMDA receptors might interact functionally and that developmental absence of D-4 receptors might trigger compensatory mechanisms that enhance expression of D-1 receptors in NAc and CPu, and NMDA receptors in NAc, CPu, and hippocampus. The findings also encourage cautious interpretation of results in knockout mice with targeted absence of specific genes, as complex adaptive changes not directly related to the missing gene might contribute to physiological and behavioral responses.

The present study determined whether sex differences also exist in angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) regulation during early remnant kidney ( REM) growth after UNX, and if so, whether GH modulates AT(1)R expression after UNX in the male rat. Scatchard analysis of radioligand binding in glomeruli demonstrated that 48 h post-UNX, AT(1)R density (B-max) was significantly decreased by 20% in female REM compared with control kidneys. In contrast, male REM glomerular Bmax was significantly increased by 28% compared with control kidneys. Furthermore, GH-suppressed male rats displayed attenuated REM growth, which was associated with a 35% decrease in AT(1)R B-max. Losartan treatment also decreased REM AT(1)R B-max by 55%. The activity of mRNA binding proteins that bind to the 5' leader sequence of the AT(1)R was regulated by UNX and GH treatment in an inverse manner to AT(1)R expression. These findings suggest that in rats 1) there are sex differences in the regulation of glomerular AT(1)R expression after UNX; 2) the increase in AT(1)R binding sites in the male REM is regulated by GH and mediates early remnant kidney growth; and 3) AT(1)R 5' leader sequence mRNA binding proteins play a role in UNX and GH regulation of glomerular AT(1)Rs in both males and females.

The PTH1R undergoes beta-arrestin/dynamin-mediated endocytosis in response to the biologically active forms of PTH, PTH-(1 34), and PTH-( 1 - 84). We now show that amino-truncated forms of PTH that do not activate the PTH1R nonetheless induce PTH1R internalization in a cell-specific pattern. Activation-independent PTH1R endocytosis proceeds through a distinct arrestin-independent mechanism that is operative in cells lacking the adaptor protein Na/H exchange regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) (ezrin-binding protein 50). Using a combination of radioligand binding experiments and quantitative, live cell confocal microscopy of fluorescently tagged PTH1Rs, we show that in kidney distal tubule cells and rat osteosarcoma cells, which lack NHERF1, the synthetic antagonist PTH-( 7 - 34) and naturally circulating PTH-( 7 - 84) induce internalization of PTH1R in a beta-arrestin-independent but dynamin-dependent manner. Expression of NHERF1 in these cells inhibited antagonist-induced endocytosis. Conversely, expression of dominant-negative forms of NHERF1 conferred internalization sensitivity to PTH-( 7 - 34) in cells expressing NHERF1. Mutation of the PTH1R PDZ-binding motif abrogated interaction of the receptor with NHERF1. These mutated receptors were fully functional but were now internalized in response to PTH-( 7 - 34) even in NHERF1-expressing cells. Removing the NHERF1 ERM domain or inhibiting actin polymerization allowed otherwise inactive ligands to internalize the PTH1R. These results demonstrate that NHERF1 acts as a molecular switch that legislates the conditional efficacy of PTH fragments. Distinct endocytic pathways are determined by NHERF1 that are operative for the PTH1R in kidney and bone cells.

Spontaneously, beating in vitro isolated working heart preparations were treated with increased concentrations (10(-11)- 10(-8) M) of fANF-(1-24). The peptide at 10(-9) and 10(-8) M significantly reduced heart rate (HR) and, on the electrically paced preparations, decreased cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and work. Such negative inotropism was abolished by pretreatment with the pertussis toxin or by blocking the particulate guanylate cyclase (GC) with anantin while it was independent both from the functional impairment of the endocardium-endothelium by Triton X-100 and the inhibition of the soluble guanylate cyclase by 1 H-(1,2,4,) oxadiazolo-(4,3-a) quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ). By autoradiography, two classes of high and low affinity NPs binding sites were detected in the ventricular endocardium and myocardium and in the bulbus arteriosus. The analysis of displacement binding data using the radioligand [I-125]-rat atrial natriuretic peptide [I-125-rANP-(1-28)], its cold counterpart and the fANF-(1-24) showed that in the ventricular myocardium, the low affinity NPs sites bound both the heterologous and the homologous ligands at a concentration close to that responsible for the negative inotropism and chronotropism.

In this study, we examined whether immunoglobulin isotypes and IgG subclass specific autoantibodies directed at IA-2 discriminate between children at risk of type 1 diabetes who progressed to diabetes vs. those who remained diabetes-free. IgG1-4, IgA and the IgE-specific IA-2 antibody (IA-2A) were measured by radioligand assays in 50 patients with type I diabetes and 41 ICA-positive siblings of patients with type 1 diabetes who were followed for diabetes development. Of 41 siblings, 32 were positive for IA-2A; of these, 59% had IA-2 IgG1, 59% IgG4, 16% IgG3, 9% IgG2, 16% IgA and 13% IgE antibodies. IA-2 IgG1 was the dominant isotype in prediabetic children (n = 14, 86% positive) and patients with type I diabetes (98% positive) whereas only 7 of 18 (39%) non-progressors had antibodies of this isotype. In subjects that remained diabetes-free, a significantly higher frequency of IA-2 IgG4 in the absence of IgG1 was observed (50%) compared to progressors (7%) and patients with type 1 diabetes (0%). Life-table analysis revealed that IA-2A restricted to IgG4 correlated with protection from type I diabetes (p < 0.003). In contrast, IA-2 IgG2, IgG3, IgE and IgA did not differ significantly between study groups. Our Findings suggest that the measurement of IA-2 IgG I and IgG4 subclass antibodies can serve as surrogate marker to discriminate between antibody positive subjects at high or low risk for rapid development of diabetes.

A radioligand binding assay was used to characterize the interaction of [H-3]vinblastine with P-gp and determine how drug binding site parameters are altered during a catalytic cycle of P-gp. In the absence of nucleotide, we show that [H-3]vinblastine interacts with a single class of binding site with high affinity (K-d = 80+/-18 nM). In the presence of the nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue AMP-PNP, the drug binding site was in a low-affinity conformation, manifest by a 9-fold increase in K-d (K-d = 731+/-20 nM). There was no alteration in the binding capacity, reflecting a complete shift in the high-affinity site to a low-affinity form. The posthydrolytic (Mg.ADP.V-i bound) form of P-gp also exhibited low-affinity substrate binding (K-d = 446+/-57 nM). Restoration of the high-affinity drug binding site conformation (K-d = 131+/-32 nM) did not occur until release of phosphate from the posthydrolysis P-gp.Mg.ADP.P-i. complex. Our results suggest that alteration of the affinity of the vinblastine binding site involves only one nucleotide binding domain per transport cycle. The binding of ATP provides the signal to instigate this change, while release of phosphate post-ATP hydrolysis returns the transporter to its original state to complete the cycle.

In this work, we study if the cytosolic level of this proteoglycan can modulate certain clinical-biological properties at CD44v5-positive infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDC) of the breast. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We have assayed, by a radioligand method, the cytosolic level of hyaluronic acid in 127 IDC. Likewise, cytosolic levels of estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), pS2, cathepsin D and tissu.-type plasminogen activators (t-PA) have been dossified, as well as those of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at cell surfaces; The menopausal status, tumor size, axillary lymph node involvement, histological grade, ploidy and S-phase have also been taken into account. RESULTS: HA positive (> 4800 ng/mg prt., which represents the median value obtained with 252 tumors) carcinomas had higher levels of PR (p = 0.035) and t-PA (p = 0.000), whereas HA negative showed a higher frequency of a tumor size > 2 cm (p = 0.015), aneuploidy (p = 0.015) and S-phase > 14% (p = 0,019), as well as histological grade 3 which reached statistical significance (p = 0.062), all of which were indicators of a worse behaviour and evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that, as it also happens with that of the cell surface, cytosolic HA levels seems to modulate certain clinical-biological features of CD44v5-positive infiltrating ductal carcinomas of the breast. Likewise, they can help us to explain the discordant results described at the literature concerning its practical value when each of them are considered separately.

This suggests that PACAP mediates locally some of the effects of the LH surge, but the putative PACAP receptor(s) involved in such an auto or paracrine activity is presently unknown. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction with specific primers to the three cloned PACAP-binding receptors called PAC(1), VPAC(1), and VPAC(2) demonstrated both PAC(1) and VPAC(2) mRNA in extracts from preovulatory follicular cells. Radioligand-binding assays revealed the presence of high-affinity binding sites with characteristics of these two receptors on the intact cells, and autoradiography demonstrated that the binding was restricted to a minor proportion of the follicular cells as well as the oocytes. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) dose-dependently stimulated cAMP accumulation and acute progesterone accumulation. Forskolin and db-cAMP also stimulated acute progesterone accumulation, and the protein kinase A inhibitor H89 dose-dependently inhibited peptide induced acute progesterone accumulation, suggesting involvement of cAMP and the protein kinase A pathway in the process. In conclusion, two of the three PACAP binding receptors are present on preovulatory follicular cells and are involved in the effects of PACAP on acute progesterone production. The data provide further evidence to establish PACAP as an auto- or paracrine regulator of LH-induced acute progesterone production in rat preovulatory follicles.

METHODS: [I-123]-FP-CIT SPECT imaging was conducted in a six-center study of 158 patients with a clinical diagnosis of parkinsonism compared with 27 ET cases and 35 healthy volunteers. Striatal uptake of the radioligand was graded normal or abnormal, and abnormal images were further graded to three levels of severity. An institutional read whereby each center visually assessed the images blinded to the clinical data and a consensus blinded read by a panel of five was undertaken. RESULTS: The institutional reading scored 154 of 158 cases of parkinsonism abnormal, all 27 cases of ET as normal, and 34 of 35 healthy volunteers as normal compared with the consensus blinded read scoring 150 cases of parkinsonism as abnormal, 25 ET cases as normal, and 33 healthy volunteers as normal. Sensitivity for the clinical diagnosis of parkinsonism was 97% and specificity for ET was 100% for the institutional read, whereas sensitivity was 95% and specificity 93% for the consensus blinded read. Semiquantitative analysis of specific: nonspecific caudate and putamen uptake were consistent with the results of visual inspection. CONCLUSION: Visual assessment of [I-123]-FP-CIT SPECT images is an easily applied diagnostic test which is helpful in the differential diagnosis of tremor disorders and in confirming a clinical diagnosis of a hypokinetic-rigid syndrome.

Thanks to this, they can provide information on the potential mechanisms of treatment-resistant depression. Since deep brain stimulation in the prefrontal cortex has been shown to produce rapid antidepressant effects in WKY rats, we focused our study on the prefrontal cortex. Using quantitative autoradiography, we observed a decrease in the binding of [H-3] methylspiperone to the dopamine D2 receptor, specifically in that brain region-but not in the striatum, nor the nucleus accumbens-in WKY rats. Further, we focused our studies on the expression level of several components associated with canonical (G proteins), as well as non-canonical, D2-receptor-associated intracellular pathways (e.g., beta arrestin2, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta-Gsk-3 beta, and beta-catenin). As a result, we observed an increase in the expression of mRNA encoding the regulator of G protein signaling 2-RGS2 protein, which is responsible, among other things, for internalizing the D2 dopamine receptor. The increase in RGS2 expression may therefore account for the decreased binding of the radioligand to the D2 receptor. In addition, WKY rats are characterized by the altered signaling of genes associated with the dopamine D2 receptor and the beta arrestin2/AKT/Gsk-3 beta/beta-catenin pathway, which may account for certain behavioral traits of this strain and for the treatment-resistant phenotype.

Therefore, COX-2 represents an attractive target for functional characterization of tumors by positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, the celecoxib derivative 3-([F-18]fluoromethyl)-1-[4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl]-5-(p-tolyl)-1H-pyrazole ([F-18]5a) was chosen as a lead compound having a reported high COX-2 inhibitory potency and a potentially low carbonic anhydrase binding tendency. The respective deuterated analog [D-2,F-18]5a and the fluoroethyl-substituted derivative [F-18]5b were selected to study the influence of these modifications with respect to COX inhibition potency in vitro and metabolic stability of the radiolabeled tracers in vivo. COX-2 inhibitory potency was found to be influenced by elongation of the side chain but, as expected, not by deuteration. An automated radiosynthesis comprising F-18-fluorination and purification under comparable conditions provided the radiotracers [F-18]5a,b and [D-2,F-18]5a in good radiochemical yields (RCY) and high radiochemical purity (RCP). Biodistribution and PET studies comparing all three compounds revealed bone accumulation of F-18-activity to be lowest for the ethyl derivative [F-18]5b. However, the deuterated analog [D-2,F-18]5a turned out to be the most stable compound of the three derivatives studied here. Time-dependent degradation of [F-18]5a,b and [D-2,F-18]5a after incubation in murine liver microsomes was in accordance with the data on metabolism in vivo. Furthermore, metabolites were identified based on UPLC-MS/MS.

Radiosynthesis of a Novel <SUP>11</SUP>C-Labeled Derivative of 4'-<i>O</i>-Methylhonokiol and Its Preliminary Evaluation in an LPS Rat Model of Neuroinflammation	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						biodistribution; carbon-11; cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2); inflammation; radiopharmaceuticals	HONOKIOL; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2; INHIBITORS; VISUALIZATION; RADIOLIGANDS; ACTIVATION; DISCOVERY; MAGNOLOL; ANALOGS	Cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) is an attractive biomarker for the visualization of neuroinflammation processes by positron emission tomography (PET). Neolignan 4'-O-methylhonokiol (MH) is known to have high anti-inflammatory activity and inhibits the expression of COX-2. We synthesized 4 '-[C-11]methoxy-5-propyl-1,1 '-biphenyl-2-ol ([C-11]MPbP), a compound based on the MH structure and labeled with carbon-11 (T-1/2=20.4 min) and studied its distribution in rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It was shown that the new ligand has significant inhibitory activity against COX-2 (IC50=0.14 mu M) and sufficient lipophilicity (logD(7.4)=2.46 +/- 0.12) for penetration the blood brain barrier (BBB). [C-11]MPbP was obtained by C-11-methylation using [C-11]CH3I with decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 20% based on [C-11]CH3I with molar activity 10-15 GBq/mu mol, high radiochemical purity (> 99%) and low level of chemical impurities (<1 mu g/ml). The radioligand did not undergo any noticeable decomposition in human plasma for 40 min. The results of ex vivo biodistribution in rats demonstrated that [C-11]MPbP crossed the BBB and the observed radioactivity uptake in brain of rats with LPS-induced neuroinflammation was 4 times higher than in intact animals. Further studies of compounds with the MH scaffold are planned for their possible application in PET, including in vivo assessment in animal neuroinflammation models.

Molecular Determinants of Brevetoxin Binding to Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels	TOXINS			English	Article						neurotoxic shellfish poisoning; voltage-gated sodium channels; binding assay	ALPHA-SCORPION TOXIN; PTYCHODISCUS-BREVIS; GREENSHELL MUSSELS; PERNA-CANALICULUS; RECEPTOR-SITE; CIGUATOXIN; BRAIN; GYMNODINIUM; DERIVATIVES; ACTIVATION	Brevetoxins are produced by dinoflagellates such as Karenia brevis in warm-water red tides and cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. They bind to voltage-gated sodium channels at neurotoxin receptor 5, making the channels more active by shifting the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative potentials and by slowing the inactivation process. Previous work using photoaffinity labeling identified binding to the IS6 and IVS5 transmembrane segments of the channel alpha subunit. We used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify molecular determinants for brevetoxin binding in these regions as well as adjacent regions IVS5-SS1 and IVS6. Most of the mutant channels containing single alanine substitutions expressed functional protein in tsA-201 cells and bound to the radioligand [42-H-3]-PbTx3. Binding affinity for the great majority of mutant channels was indistinguishable from wild type. However, transmembrane segments IS6, IVS5 and IVS6 each contained 2 to 4 amino acid positions where alanine substitution resulted in a 2-3-fold reduction in brevetoxin affinity, and additional mutations caused a similar increase in brevetoxin affinity. These findings are consistent with a model in which brevetoxin binds to a protein cleft comprising transmembrane segments IS6, IVS5 and IVS6 and makes multiple distributed interactions with these alpha helices. Determination of brevetoxin affinity for Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.4 and Na(v)1.5 channels showed that Na(v)1.5 channels had a characteristic 5-fold reduction in affinity for brevetoxin relative to the other channel isoforms, suggesting the interaction with sodium channels is specific despite the distributed binding determinants.

With respect to developing novel fluorinated PET tracers, regioisomeric fluoroethoxy derivatives 11, 12, 14, and 15 were synthesized. Analogs 19 and 20 with various heteroaryl moieties at the end of the N-side chain were prepared by Sonogashira reaction and nucleophilic substitution. The fluoroethyl triazole 37 was obtained by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. In several new ligands, the flexibility of the (hetero) arylbutyl side chain was restricted by incorporation of a triple bond. The affinity towards the ifenprodil binding site was tested in an established competition assay using [H-3] ifenprodil as radioligand. Introduction of a fluoroethoxy moiety at the terminal phenyl ring, replacement of the terminal phenyl ring by a heteroaryl ring and incorporation of a triple bond into the butyl spacer led to considerable reduction of GluN2B affinity. The phenol 15 (K-i=193 nM) bearing a p-fluoroethoxy moiety at the terminal phenyl ring represents the most promising GluN2B ligand of this series of compounds. With exception of 15 showing moderate sigma(2) affinity (K-i=79 nM), the interaction of synthesized 3-benzazepines towards the PCP binding site of the NMDA receptor, sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors was rather low (K-i > 100 nM).

Receptor Activity Modifying Proteins Have Limited Effects on the Class B G Protein-Coupled Receptor Calcitonin Receptor-Like Receptor Stalk	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1; 3RD EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; CRYO-EM STRUCTURE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; GLP-1 RECEPTOR; MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; CGRP RECEPTOR; N-TERMINUS; BINDING	The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that forms the basis of three pharmacologically distinct receptors, the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, and two adrenomedullin (AM) receptors. These three receptors are created by CLR interacting with three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). Class B GPCRs have an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane bundle that are both important for binding endogenous ligands. These two domains are joined together by a stretch of amino acids that is referred to as the "stalk". Studies of other class B GPCRs suggest that the stalk may act as hinge, allowing the ECD to adopt multiple conformations. It is unclear what the role of the stalk is within CLR and whether RAMPs can influence its function. Therefore, this study investigated the role of this region using an alanine scan. Effects of mutations were measured with all three RAMPs through cell surface expression, cAMP production and, in select cases, radioligand binding and total cell expression assays. Most mutants did not affect expression or cAMP signaling. CLR C127A, N140A, F142A, and L144A impaired cell surface expression with all three RAMPs. T125A decreased the potency of all peptides at all receptors. N128A, V135A, and L139A showed ligand-dependent effects. While the stalk appears to play a role in CLR function, the effect of RAMPs on this region seems limited, in contrast to their effects on the structure of CLR in other receptor regions.

We hypothesized that the conserved arginine cluster (RRR) located within the insert could act as an RXR-type endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. Arginine residues (R) within the cluster at positions 267, 268, and 269 were charge-reserved to glutamic acids (E), either individually or in clusters, thus generating single, double, and triple D-2L-R mutants. Through analyses of cellular localization by confocal microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioligand binding assay, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2) -arrestin 2 (arr2) recruitment assay, and cAMP signaling, it was revealed that charge reversal of the R residues at all three positions within the motif impaired their colocalization with ER marker calnexin and led to significantly improved cell surface expression. Additionally, these data demonstrate that an R to glutamic acid (E) substitution at position 2 within the RXR motif is not functionally permissible. Furthermore, all generated D-2L-R mutants preserved their functional integrity regarding ligand binding, agonist-induced arr2 recruitment and G(i)-mediated signaling. In summary, our results show that the conserved arginine cluster within the 29-amino acid insert of third cytoplasmic loop (IC3) of the D-2L-R appears to be the ER retention signal.

Michael			Seasonal variation in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in metabolic tissues of the house sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Corticosterone; Energy mobilization hypothesis; Bird; Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis	LIFE-HISTORY; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; INSULIN INTERACT; BINDING-SITES; CORTICOSTERONE; STRESS; PROTEIN; PLASMA; MEMBRANE; GLUCOSE	Glucocorticoid hormones like corticosterone (CORT) play essential metabolic roles at both baseline and stress-induced concentrations, and CORT titers vary seasonally in patterns occurring across many different vertebrate species. It has been hypothesized that CURT may vary seasonally due to changing energy requirements at different times of year. However, hormone effects are dependent on binding to receptors in target tissues, and receptors might also vary seasonally. CURT alters metabolism primarily through binding to two receptors, the high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We quantified GR and MR in metabolic tissues (liver, kidney, omental and subcutaneous fat, and gastrocnemius and pectoralis muscle) of wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to assess these tissues' capacity to respond to CURT-mediated metabolic demands. We quantified receptors using radioligand binding assays in early and late winter, pre-egg-laying, breeding, late breeding and molt (n = 12 at each stage). MR binding did not vary significantly in any tissue over the course of the year. Because MR is associated with baseline CURT effects, this suggests that changing hormone titers may primarily regulate baseline CURT effects on metabolism. Seasonal modulation of GR binding occurred in every tissue but omental fat, though peak receptor density did not coincide with peak stress-induced CURT concentrations measured previously. Because GR is associated with stress-induced CURT effects, these data demonstrate seasonal patterns in stress-induced CURT are not driven by metabolic needs alone, although at different times of year sparrows may vary which tissue types respond to increased energy demands resulting from exposure to stressors.

Characterization of a recombinant humanized anti-cocaine monoclonal antibody and its Fab fragment	HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						cocaine; Fab fragment; fluorescence quenching; heterogeneity; high performance ion exchange chromatography; ligand binding; monoclonal antibody; non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis	CHEMICAL-MODIFICATIONS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; IGG MOLECULES; LC-MS; PROTEINS; 4-(AMINOSULFONYL)-7-FLUORO-2,1,3-BENZOXADIAZOLE; REDUCTION; BRAIN	Variations of post-translational modifications are important for stability and in vivo behavior of therapeutic antibodies. A recombinant humanized anti-cocaine monoclonal antibody (h2E2) was characterized for heterogeneity of N-linked glycosylation and disulfide bonds. In addition, charge heterogeneity, which is partially due to the presence or absence of C-terminal lysine on the heavy chains, was examined. For cocaine overdose therapy, Fab fragments may be therapeutic, and thus, a simplified method of generation, purification, and characterization of the Fab fragment generated by Endoproteinase Lys-C digestion was devised. Both the intact h2E2 antibody and purified Fab fragments were analyzed for their affinities for cocaine and 2 of its metabolites, benzoylecgonine and cocaethylene, by fluorescence quenching of intrinsic antibody tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence resulting from binding of these drugs. Binding constants obtained from fluorescence quenching measurements are in agreement with recently published radioligand and ELISA binding assays. The dissociation constants determined for the h2E2 monoclonal and its Fab fragment are approximately 1, 5, and 20 nM for cocaethylene, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine, respectively. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching (emission at 330 nm) was measured after either excitation of tyrosine and tryptophan (280 nm) or selective excitation of tryptophan alone (295 nm). More accurate binding constants are obtained using tryptophan selective excitation at 295 nm, likely due to interfering absorption of cocaine and metabolites at 280 nm. These quenching results are consistent with multiple tryptophan and tyrosine residues in or near the predicted binding location of cocaine in a previously published 3-D model of this antibody's variable region.

All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with Karolinska Institutet's guidelines and were approved by the local laboratory animal ethics committee. We used clinical neurointerventional systems to place microcatheters in the extra- or intracranial carotid artery of 15 Sprague-Dawley rats. Here, injection dynamics of iodine contrast was assessed using digital subtraction angiography. Maintaining the catheter position, the animals were placed in a micro PET and small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) was used to analyze injections [2-F-18]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (F-18-FDG). Microcatheters had to be placed in the intracranial carotid artery (iICA) for the infusate to distribute to the brain. Selective injection via the iICA resulted in a 9-fold higher uptake of F-18-FDG in the injected hemisphere (p < 0.005) compared to both intravenous and more proximal carotid artery injections. Furthermore, selective injection gave a dramatically improved contrast between the brain and extracranial tissue. Intra-arterial injection increases the cerebral uptake of a radiotracer dramatically compared to systemic injection. This technique has potential applications for endovascular treatment of malignancies allowing intra-interventional modifications of injection strategy, based on information on tumor perfusion and risk to surrounding normal parenchyma. Furthermore the technique may increase diagnostic sensitivity and avoid problems due to peripheral pharmacological barriers and first passage metabolism of labile tracers.

Cannabidivarin-rich cannabis extracts are anticonvulsant in mouse and rat via a CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-independent mechanism	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						seizure; epilepsy; cannabinoid; cannabidivarin; cannabidiol; anticonvulsant; tolerability; isobologram; radioligand binding assays	TEMPORAL-LOBE; PLANT CANNABINOIDS; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; ANIMAL-MODELS; IN-VITRO; SEIZURES; DELTA(9)-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; INHIBITION; MICE; TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL	Background and PurposeEpilepsy is the most prevalent neurological disease and is characterized by recurrent seizures. Here, we investigate (i) the anticonvulsant profiles of cannabis-derived botanical drug substances (BDSs) rich in cannabidivarin (CBDV) and containing cannabidiol (CBD) in acute in vivo seizure models and (ii) the binding of CBDV BDSs and their components at cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Experimental ApproachThe anticonvulsant profiles of two CBDV BDSs (50-422mgkg(-1)) were evaluated in three animal models of acute seizure. Purified CBDV and CBD were also evaluated in an isobolographic study to evaluate potential pharmacological interactions. CBDV BDS effects on motor function were also investigated using static beam and grip strength assays. Binding of CBDV BDSs to cannabinoid CB1 receptors was evaluated using displacement binding assays. Key ResultsCBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in the pentylenetetrazole (100mgkg(-1)) and audiogenic seizure models (87mgkg(-1)), and suppressed pilocarpine-induced convulsions (100mgkg(-1)). The isobolographic study revealed that the anticonvulsant effects of purified CBDV and CBD were linearly additive when co-administered. Some motor effects of CBDV BDSs were observed on static beam performance; no effects on grip strength were found. The (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and (9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin content of CBDV BDS accounted for its greater affinity for CB1 cannabinoid receptors than purified CBDV. Conclusions and ImplicationsCBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in three models of seizure that were not mediated by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and were of comparable efficacy with purified CBDV. These findings strongly support the further clinical development of CBDV BDSs for the treatment of epilepsy.	[Hill, T. D. M.; Whalley, B. J.; Hill, A.

Consumption of either shellfish or finfish contaminated by K. brevis blooms can lead to the development of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. The toxic effects of brevetoxins are due to binding at a defined site on, and subsequent activation of, voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs) in cell membranes (site 5). In addition to brevetoxins, K. brevis produces several other ladder-frame compounds. One of these compounds, brevenal, has been shown to antagonize the effects of brevetoxin. In an effort to further characterize the effects of brevenal, a radioactive analog ([H-3]-brevenol) was produced by reducing the terminal aldehyde moiety of brevenal to an alcohol using tritiated sodium borohydride. A K-D of 67 nM and B-max of 7.1 pmol/mg protein were obtained for [H-3]-brevenol in rat brain synaptosomes, suggesting a 1:1 matching with VSSCs. Brevenal and brevenol competed for [H-3]-brevenol binding with K-i values of 75 nM and 56 nM, respectively. However, although both brevenal and brevenol inhibited brevetoxin binding, brevetoxin was completely ineffective at competition for [H-3]-brevenol binding. After examining other site-specific compounds, it was determined that [H-3]-brevenol binds to a site that is distinct from the other known sites on the sodium channel, including the brevetoxin site, (site 5) although some interaction with site 5 is apparent.

Although non-adrenergic, imidazoline (I) receptors have been revealed in human platelets, there is limited information about imidazoline's action on platelet aggregation. This study aimed to investigate aggregatory and anti-aggregatory effects of various imidazoline or non-imidazoline alpha-adrenergic agents on rabbit platelets. Methods: Aggregatory responses of agents on rabbit platelets were examined by turbidimetric method. Radioligand binding assay to platelet I-1 and I-2 receptors was performed using [H-3]-clonidine and [H-3]-idazoxan, respectively. Results: Aggregation was not induced by alpha-adrenoceptor agonists alone. Adrenaline and noradrenaline produced dose-dependent potentiation of ADP- or collagen-induced aggregation. Imidazoline adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and p-aminoclonidine also potentiated ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists and/or certain imidazoline adrenergic agents inhibited adrenaline-potentiated aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists and non-imidazoline alpha-adrenergic agents were either ineffective or less effective in inhibiting adrenaline-potentiated aggregation. Rabbit platelets did not have I-1 receptors, but had I-2 receptors, indicating that adrenaline-potentiated platelet aggregation was inhibited by idazoxan, but not by imidazoline compounds clonidine and oxymetazoline. Conclusions/Implications: These results demonstrated that alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-blocking agents and/or imidazoline alpha-adrenergic agents effectively inhibit adrenaline-potentiated platelet aggregation. It is proposed that imidazoline structure in part plays a role in the inhibition of adrenaline-potentiated aggregation. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

The Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonist Almorexant Induces Sleep and Decreases Orexin-Induced Locomotion by Blocking Orexin 2 Receptors	SLEEP			English	Article						Orexin; hypocretin; mouse; sleep mechanisms; locomotion	PROMOTES WAKEFULNESS; KNOCKOUT MICE; REM-SLEEP; HYPOCRETIN; NARCOLEPSY; NEURONS; CATAPLEXY; PEPTIDES; EXPRESSION; DISCHARGE	Study Objectives: Orexin peptides activate orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors (OX1R and OX2R), regulate locomotion and sleep-wake. The dual OX1R/OX2R antagonist almorexant reduces activity and promotes sleep in multiple species, including man. The relative contributions of the two receptors in locomotion and sleep/wake regulation were investigated in mice. Design: Mice lacking orexin receptors were used to determine the contribution of OX1R and OX2R to orexin A-induced locomotion and to almorexant-induced sleep. Setting: N/A. Patients or Participants: C57BL/6J mice and OX1R+/+, OX1R-/-, OX2R+/+, OX2R-/- and OX1R-/-/OX2R-/- mice. Interventions: Intracerebroventricular orexin A; oral dosing of almorexant. Measurements and Results: Almorexant attenuated orexin A-induced locomotion. As in other species, almorexant dose-dependently increased rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and nonREM sleep in mice. Almorexant and orexin A were ineffective in OX1R-/-/OX2R-/- mice. Both orexin Ainduced locomotion and sleep induction by almorexant were absent in OX2R-/- mice. Interestingly, almorexant did not induce cataplexy in wild-type mice under conditions where cataplexy was seen in mice lacking orexins and in OX1R-/-/OX2R-/- mice. Almorexant dissociates very slowly from OX2R as measured functionally and in radioligand binding. Under non equilibrium conditions in vitro, almorexant was a dual antagonist whereas at equilibrium, almorexant became OX2R selective. Conclusions: In vivo, almorexant specifically inhibits the actions of orexin A. The two known orexin receptors mediate sleep induction by almorexant and orexin A-induced locomotion. However, OX2R activation mediates locomotion induction by orexin A and antagonism of OX2R is sufficient to promote sleep in mice.

We investigated the chronic effects of aripiprazole (ARI) on dopamine sensitivity. Methods: We administered ARI (1.5 mg/kg/d), haloperidol (HAL; 0.75 mg/kg/d), or vehicle (VEH) via minipump for 14 days to drug-naive rats or to rats pre-treated with HAL (0.75 mg/kg/d) or VEH via minipump for 14 days. On the seventh day following treatment cessation, we examined the effects of the treatment conditions on the locomotor response to methamphetamine and on striatal D-2 receptor density (N = 4-10/condition/experiment). Results: Chronic treatment with HAL led to significant increases in locomotor response and D-2 receptor density, compared with the effects of chronic treatment with either VEH or ARI; there were no significant differences in either locomotor response or D-2 density between the VEH- and ARI-treated groups. We also investigated the effects of chronic treatment with HAL, ARI, or VEH preceded by HAL or VEH treatment on locomotor response and D-2 density. ANOVA analysis indicated that the rank ordering of groups for both locomotor response and D-2 density was HAL-HAL > HAL-VEH > HAL-ARI > VEH-VEH. Conclusions: Chronic treatment with ARI prevents development of dopamine supersensitivity and potentially supersensitivity psychosis, suggesting that by reducing excessive sensitivity to dopamine and by stabilizing sensitivity for an extended period of time, ARI may be helpful for some patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Buprenorphine Metabolites, Buprenorphine-3-glucuronide and Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide, Are Biologically Active	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							OPIOID RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; INTRAVENOUS BUPRENORPHINE; RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; INHIBITORS; MORPHINE-6-GLUCURONIDE; ANTIRETROVIRALS; PHARMACOLOGY; ACTIVATION; DELTA	Background: The long-lasting high-affinity opioid buprenorphine has complex pharmacology, including ceiling effects with respect to analgesia and respiratory depression. Plasma concentrations of the major buprenorphine metabolites norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine-3-glucuronide, and norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide approximate or exceed those of the parent drug. Buprenorphine glucuronide metabolites pharmacology is undefined. This investigation determined binding and pharmacologic activity of the two glucuronide metabolites, and in comparison with buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. Methods: Competitive inhibition of radioligand binding to human mu, kappa, and delta opioid and nociceptin receptors was used to determine glucuronide binding affinities for these receptors. Common opiate effects were assessed in vivo in Swiss-Webster mice. Antinociception was assessed using a tail-flick assay, respiratory effects were measured using unrestrained whole-body plethysmography, and sedation was assessed by inhibition of locomotion measured by open-field testing. Results: Buprenorphine-3-glucuronide had high affinity for human mu(Ki [inhibition constant] = 4.9 +/- 2.7 pM), delta (Ki = 270 +/- 0.4 nM), and nociceptin (Ki = 36 +/- 0.3 mu M) but not kappa receptors. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide had affinity for human kappa (Ki = 300 +/- 0.5 nM) and nociceptin (Ki = 18 +/- 0.2 mu M) but not mu or delta receptors. At the dose tested, buprenorphine-3-glucuronide had a small antinociceptive effect. Neither glucuronide had significant effects on respiratory rate, but norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide decreased tidal volume. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide also caused sedation. Conclusions: Both glucuronide metabolites of buprenorphine are biologically active at doses relevant to metabolite exposures, which occur after buprenorphine. Activity of the glucuronides may contribute to the overall pharmacology of buprenorphine.

This study presents in vivo (Positron Emission Tomography (PET)) and in vitro (autoradiography) measurements of mGluR5 densities in the same rats and evaluates both noninvasive and blood-dependent pharmacokinetic models for the quantification of [C-11]ABP688 binding. Eleven rats underwent [C-11]ABP688 PET scans. In five animals, baseline scans were compared with blockade experiments with the antagonist 1,2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), and arterial blood samples were drawn and corrected for metabolites. Afterward, saturation-binding autoradiography was performed. Blocking with MPEP resulted in an average decrease of the total distribution volume (V-T) between 43% and 58% (thalamus and caudate-putamen, respectively) but had no significant effect on cerebellar V-T (mean reduction: -0.01%). Comparing binding potential (BPND) based on the V-T with noninvasively determined BPND revealed an average negative bias of 0.7% in the caudate-putamen and an average positive bias of 3.1% in the low-binding regions. Scan duration of 50 minutes is required. The cerebellum is a suitable reference region for the quantification of mGluR(5) availability as measured with [C-11]ABP688 PET in rats. Blood-based and reference region-based PET quantification shows a significant linear relationship to autoradiographic determinations.

We identified a novel interaction site, N760 in TM5, which negatively regulates activation of mGluR1 with a newly discovered selective mGluR1 antagonist, 3-cyclohexyl-5-fluoro-6-methyl-7-(2-morpholinA-ylethoxy)-4H-chromen-4-one (CFMMC). CFMMC inhibited L-glutamate-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization ([Ca2+](i)) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant human mGluR1 a with IC50 value of 50 nM, whereas it did not inhibit [Ca2+](i) in CHO cells expressing human mGluR5a [IC50: >10 mu M). To identify the amino acid residues critical for antagonism of CFMMC, we constructed various point mutants of human mGluR1 and evaluated them in [Ca2+](i) assays. The inhibitory effects of CFMMC were significantly affected in point mutations of either I725 in TM4 or N760 in TM5, as well as mutations of W798, F801 and Y805 in TM6 or T815 in TM7. Further studies revealed that antagonistic activities of not only CFMMC but also other, structurally unrelated, mGluR1 antagonists such as 6-amino-N-cyclohexyl-N,3-dimethylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole-2-carboxamide (YM-298198) and Compound 1 were reduced in N760 mutated mGluR1a.

The amyloid-imaging positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [C-11]PIB (N-methyl[C-11]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole) is used in the assessment of A beta deposits in the human brain. [C-11]PIB-amyloid interaction and insoluble A beta 40 and A beta 42 peptide levels in the brain were quantified in postmortem tissue from nine AD patients and nine age-matched control subjects in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices and the cerebellum. Autoradiographical studies showed significantly higher densities of specific [C-11]PIB-amyloid binding in gray matter in the temporal and parietal cortex (62 fmol/mg tissue) in AD patients as compared to control subjects, whereas the density was somewhat lower in the frontal cortex (56 fmol/mg tissue). No specific binding could be detected in the AD cerebellum or in the tissues from the control subjects (<= 5 fmol/mg tissue). Insoluble A beta 40 and total A beta levels (i.e. sum of A beta 40 and A beta 42) were significantly higher in patients than in controls in all measured cortical regions as determined using ELISA, which was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. The present findings show a more regional selective distribution of [C-11]PIB amyloid binding than previously reported. Moreover, it is suggested that some of the [C-11]PIB binding and insoluble A beta seen in control subjects may be amyloid in the blood vessels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Do gene polymorphisms alone or in combination affect the function of human β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptors?

The corresponding gene is polymorphic, and the W64R (Trp64Arg) single nucleotide polymorphism has been associated with disease states such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and bladder dysfunction. While these clinical data suggest that the 64R variant is hypofunctional, previous in vitro studies in which this variant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent transfection have not consistently confirmed this. Experimental approach: We transfected the wild-type human beta(3)-adrenoceptor and the 64R variant and also the more recently discovered 265M and 306F variants as well as 64R/265M and 64R/306F double mutants into human embryonic kidney cells and selected clones expressing the receptors at a density of about 100 fmol mg protein(-1). Receptor activation was measured by cAMP accumulation and ligand affinity by radioligand binding. Desensitisation was assessed as alterations of cAMP responses after prolonged agonist treatment. Key results: Neither mutated receptor exhibited alterations in efficacy or potency for cAMP accumulation for any of five agonists (isoprenaline, noradrenaline, YM 178, FK 4664, CGP 12 177). In competition binding studies, the mutations did not affect the ability of any agonist to bind to the receptor. Wild-type receptors and the 64R variant exhibited similar isoprenaline-induced functional desensitization during a 24 h treatment. Conclusions and implications: None of the polymorphisms tested here significantly altered the interaction of isoprenaline, noradrenaline, YM 178, FK 4664 or CGP 12 177 with the human beta(3)-adrenoceptor when expressed at near physiological levels in a human cell line.

It is associated with a range of adverse consequences for human health, economic productivity and quality of life. In animal and human studies, administration of melatonin has been reported to promote sleep, although there has been controversy regarding its effectiveness. The present study used a chronically implanted radiotelemetry transmitter to record electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) to enable discrimination of wake (W), nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in un-restrained rats. The acute action of melatonin and ramelteon, a melatonin agonist recently approved for long-term treatment of insomnia in the USA, was examined. Radioligand binding assays on recombinant human MT(1)/MT(2) receptors showed that both the melatonin and ramelteon were both high affinity, nonsubtype selective ligands. Both compounds acted as potent full agonists on a cellular model of melatonin action, the pigment aggregation response in Xenopus laevis melanophores. Both melatonin and ramelteon (10 mg/kg, i/p), administered close to the mid-point of the dark phase of the L:D cycle, significantly reduced NREM sleep latency (time from injection to the appearance of NREM sleep). Both the drugs also produced a short-lasting increase in NREM sleep duration, but the NREM power spectrum was unaltered. Neither drug altered REM latency, REM sleep duration nor power spectrum during REM sleep. In conclusion, ramelteon administration, like melatonin, exerted an acute, short-lasting sleep-promoting effect in the rat, the model most commonly used to evaluate the activity of novel hypnotic drugs.

However, the binding of ACE inhibitors to the B(1)Rs has never been directly evaluated. Information about binding of a radiolabeled inhibitor to natural or recombinant ACE in intact cells (physiologic ionic composition) was also collected. We used the tritiated form of an ACE inhibitor previously proposed to activate the B1R, enalaprilat, to address these questions using recombinant human B(1)Rs and naturally expressed or recombinant ACE. [H-3]Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK bound to the human recombinant B(1)Rs with high affinity (K-D 0.35 nM) in HEK 293a cells. [H-3]Enalaprilat (0.25-10 nM) did not bind to cells expressing recombinant human B1R, but bound with a subnanomolar affinity to recombinant ACE or to naturally expressed ACE in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The radioligand was further validated using a binding competition assay that involved unlabeled ACE inhibitors or their prodrug forms in endothelial cells. Membranes of HEK 293a cells that expressed B(1)Rs did not hydrolyze hippurylglycylglycine (an ACE substrate). Enalaprilat did not stimulate calcium signaling in HEK 293a cells that expressed B(1)Rs. A typical ACE inhibitor did not bind to nor stimulate the human B(1)Rs; nevertheless, several other indirect mechanisms could connect ACE inhibition to B1R stimulation in vivo. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, the heart regions consist of tissue rich in ganglion cells (that are of importance in heart neural circuits) and those virtually free of them (myocytes). Therefore, we have examined the differences in the distribution of mRNAs/receptor binding sites in the atrial samples of the heart rich in ganglion cells vs. those are virtually free of them. Binding sites and mRNAs of muscarinic receptors and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors differ in their distribution in different heart regions. The mRNAs for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors were almost equally distributed herein, while the amount of P-adrenoceptors significantly differs in the heart regions. The alpha(1A)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors mRNAs were also found in all investigated heart regions, but at significantly lower level and have not shown region differences. This is a new finding, especially to beta(3)-adrenoceptors, as they were not regularly found in each heart regions. alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors have similar distribution of their mRNAs and binding sites in some heart parts. Thus, we can conclude that there are noticeable differences in the presence of receptors in heart regions that contain ganglion cells in comparison to those are virtually free of them.

Binding of the radioligand [F-18]MPPF to 5HT(IA) receptors is sensitive to levels of endogenous serotonin. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate changes in serotonin receptor availability in the human brain in wakefulness and sleep using [F-18]MPPF and positron emission tomography. 14 subjects with narcolepsy cataplexy underwent [F-18]MPPF PET scans in wakefulness and in sleep. Subjects who used the stimulant methylphenidate took their normal medication for the wake scan but omitted it prior to the sleep scan. The change in binding potential (BP) between the sleep and wake scans was examined using paired t test. Methylphenidate is thought to have little or no effect on serotonergic neurotransmission, and in order to confirm the absence of all effect oil [F-18]MPPF binding, a concurrent study was performed using a beta-microprobe technique to examine the effect of methylphenidate administration on [F-18]MPPF binding in Sprague-DawleN rats. The human study showed a significant increase in [F-18]MPPF binding in sleep compared to wakefulness in the whole brain and all regions of interest examined (temporal cortex, mesial temporal region and cingulate cortex). The microprobe study confirmed that methylphenidate administration had no effect on [F-18]MPPF binding. These findings indicate that scrotonin receptor availability is increased in sleep compared to wakefulness in narcoleptic humans. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Blockade of mu-opiate receptors with naltrexone reduces the relapse risk among some but not all alcoholic individuals. Objective: To test the hypothesis that alcohol craving is pronounced among alcoholic individuals with a high availability of mu-opiate receptors in the brain reward system. Design: Patients and comparison sample. The availability of central mu-opiate receptors was measured in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand carbon 11-labeled carfentanil in the ventral striatum and compared with the severity of alcohol craving as assessed by the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). Setting: Hospitalized care. Participants: Volunteer sample of 25 male alcohol-dependent inpatients assessed after detoxification of whom 12 underwent PET again 5 weeks later. Control group of 10 healthy men. Main Outcome Measures: After I to 3 weeks of abstinence, the availability of mu-opiate receptors in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, was significantly elevated in alcoholic patients compared with healthy controls and remained elevated when 12 alcoholic patients had these levels measured 5 weeks later (P<.05 corrected for multiple testing). Higher availability of mu-opiate receptors in this brain area correlated significantly with the intensity of alcohol craving as assessed by the OCDS. Conclusions: Abstinent alcoholic patients displayed an increase in mu-opiate receptors in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, which correlated with the severity of alcohol craving. These findings point to a neuronal correlate of alcohol urges.

Contractility and relaxation studies were performed on guinea pig atrial myocardium, pulmonary artery, and thoracic aorta to compare the pharmacological effects of NECA and F-NECA (a non-emitting derivative) on tissues. Furthermore, the effect of NECA and F-NECA on the potassium conductance was investigated in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells with the patch-clamp technique. Both NECA and F-NECA reduced the contractile force in atrial myocardium and evoked phasic contraction in pulmonary artery (A(1) adenosine-receptor-mediated actions) in a dose dependent manner; however, the apparent affinity was lower for F-NECA. No difference was found in relaxation induced by these compounds in 1 muM noradrenaline-precontracted aorta and pulmonary artery (in the presence of DPCPX, an A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist, tissue containing A(2B) adenosine receptors). NECA (5 muM) and F-NECA (5 muM) also decreased the peak current and accelerated activation and inactivation properties of the potassium channels, but F-NECA was less effective. These results suggest that while NECA and F-NECA are equivalent agonists of vascular A(2B) receptors, they mediate different changes of some parameters. When evaluating the data obtained by the use of radiolabelled ligands, one has to take into consideration the possible physiological effects of the ligands besides its binding properties to tissues.
