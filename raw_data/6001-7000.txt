Radiosynthesis of a Novel <SUP>11</SUP>C-Labeled Derivative of 4'-<i>O</i>-Methylhonokiol and Its Preliminary Evaluation in an LPS Rat Model of Neuroinflammation	CHEMISTRYSELECT			English	Article						biodistribution; carbon-11; cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2); inflammation; radiopharmaceuticals	HONOKIOL; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2; INHIBITORS; VISUALIZATION; RADIOLIGANDS; ACTIVATION; DISCOVERY; MAGNOLOL; ANALOGS	Cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) is an attractive biomarker for the visualization of neuroinflammation processes by positron emission tomography (PET). Neolignan 4'-O-methylhonokiol (MH) is known to have high anti-inflammatory activity and inhibits the expression of COX-2. We synthesized 4 '-[C-11]methoxy-5-propyl-1,1 '-biphenyl-2-ol ([C-11]MPbP), a compound based on the MH structure and labeled with carbon-11 (T-1/2=20.4 min) and studied its distribution in rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). It was shown that the new ligand has significant inhibitory activity against COX-2 (IC50=0.14 mu M) and sufficient lipophilicity (logD(7.4)=2.46 +/- 0.12) for penetration the blood brain barrier (BBB). [C-11]MPbP was obtained by C-11-methylation using [C-11]CH3I with decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 20% based on [C-11]CH3I with molar activity 10-15 GBq/mu mol, high radiochemical purity (> 99%) and low level of chemical impurities (<1 mu g/ml). The radioligand did not undergo any noticeable decomposition in human plasma for 40 min. The results of ex vivo biodistribution in rats demonstrated that [C-11]MPbP crossed the BBB and the observed radioactivity uptake in brain of rats with LPS-induced neuroinflammation was 4 times higher than in intact animals. Further studies of compounds with the MH scaffold are planned for their possible application in PET, including in vivo assessment in animal neuroinflammation models.

Molecular Determinants of Brevetoxin Binding to Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels	TOXINS			English	Article						neurotoxic shellfish poisoning; voltage-gated sodium channels; binding assay	ALPHA-SCORPION TOXIN; PTYCHODISCUS-BREVIS; GREENSHELL MUSSELS; PERNA-CANALICULUS; RECEPTOR-SITE; CIGUATOXIN; BRAIN; GYMNODINIUM; DERIVATIVES; ACTIVATION	Brevetoxins are produced by dinoflagellates such as Karenia brevis in warm-water red tides and cause neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. They bind to voltage-gated sodium channels at neurotoxin receptor 5, making the channels more active by shifting the voltage-dependence of activation to more negative potentials and by slowing the inactivation process. Previous work using photoaffinity labeling identified binding to the IS6 and IVS5 transmembrane segments of the channel alpha subunit. We used alanine-scanning mutagenesis to identify molecular determinants for brevetoxin binding in these regions as well as adjacent regions IVS5-SS1 and IVS6. Most of the mutant channels containing single alanine substitutions expressed functional protein in tsA-201 cells and bound to the radioligand [42-H-3]-PbTx3. Binding affinity for the great majority of mutant channels was indistinguishable from wild type. However, transmembrane segments IS6, IVS5 and IVS6 each contained 2 to 4 amino acid positions where alanine substitution resulted in a 2-3-fold reduction in brevetoxin affinity, and additional mutations caused a similar increase in brevetoxin affinity. These findings are consistent with a model in which brevetoxin binds to a protein cleft comprising transmembrane segments IS6, IVS5 and IVS6 and makes multiple distributed interactions with these alpha helices. Determination of brevetoxin affinity for Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.4 and Na(v)1.5 channels showed that Na(v)1.5 channels had a characteristic 5-fold reduction in affinity for brevetoxin relative to the other channel isoforms, suggesting the interaction with sodium channels is specific despite the distributed binding determinants.

Negative allosteric modulators interacting with the ifenprodil binding site of the NMDA receptor are able to interrupt this ongoing neurodamaging process. Starting from the potent 3-benzazepine-1,7-diol 4a novel NMDA receptor antagonists were designed by modification of the N-(4-phenylbutyl) side chain. With respect to developing novel fluorinated PET tracers, regioisomeric fluoroethoxy derivatives 11, 12, 14, and 15 were synthesized. Analogs 19 and 20 with various heteroaryl moieties at the end of the N-side chain were prepared by Sonogashira reaction and nucleophilic substitution. The fluoroethyl triazole 37 was obtained by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. In several new ligands, the flexibility of the (hetero) arylbutyl side chain was restricted by incorporation of a triple bond. The affinity towards the ifenprodil binding site was tested in an established competition assay using [H-3] ifenprodil as radioligand. Introduction of a fluoroethoxy moiety at the terminal phenyl ring, replacement of the terminal phenyl ring by a heteroaryl ring and incorporation of a triple bond into the butyl spacer led to considerable reduction of GluN2B affinity. The phenol 15 (K-i=193 nM) bearing a p-fluoroethoxy moiety at the terminal phenyl ring represents the most promising GluN2B ligand of this series of compounds. With exception of 15 showing moderate sigma(2) affinity (K-i=79 nM), the interaction of synthesized 3-benzazepines towards the PCP binding site of the NMDA receptor, sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors was rather low (K-i > 100 nM).

Receptor Activity Modifying Proteins Have Limited Effects on the Class B G Protein-Coupled Receptor Calcitonin Receptor-Like Receptor Stalk	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1; 3RD EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; CRYO-EM STRUCTURE; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; GLP-1 RECEPTOR; MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS; CGRP RECEPTOR; N-TERMINUS; BINDING	The calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CLR) is a class B G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that forms the basis of three pharmacologically distinct receptors, the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor, and two adrenomedullin (AM) receptors. These three receptors are created by CLR interacting with three receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). Class B GPCRs have an N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) and transmembrane bundle that are both important for binding endogenous ligands. These two domains are joined together by a stretch of amino acids that is referred to as the "stalk". Studies of other class B GPCRs suggest that the stalk may act as hinge, allowing the ECD to adopt multiple conformations. It is unclear what the role of the stalk is within CLR and whether RAMPs can influence its function. Therefore, this study investigated the role of this region using an alanine scan. Effects of mutations were measured with all three RAMPs through cell surface expression, cAMP production and, in select cases, radioligand binding and total cell expression assays. Most mutants did not affect expression or cAMP signaling. CLR C127A, N140A, F142A, and L144A impaired cell surface expression with all three RAMPs. T125A decreased the potency of all peptides at all receptors. N128A, V135A, and L139A showed ligand-dependent effects. While the stalk appears to play a role in CLR function, the effect of RAMPs on this region seems limited, in contrast to their effects on the structure of CLR in other receptor regions.

We hypothesized that the conserved arginine cluster (RRR) located within the insert could act as an RXR-type endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal. Arginine residues (R) within the cluster at positions 267, 268, and 269 were charge-reserved to glutamic acids (E), either individually or in clusters, thus generating single, double, and triple D-2L-R mutants. Through analyses of cellular localization by confocal microscopy and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), radioligand binding assay, bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET2) -arrestin 2 (arr2) recruitment assay, and cAMP signaling, it was revealed that charge reversal of the R residues at all three positions within the motif impaired their colocalization with ER marker calnexin and led to significantly improved cell surface expression. Additionally, these data demonstrate that an R to glutamic acid (E) substitution at position 2 within the RXR motif is not functionally permissible. Furthermore, all generated D-2L-R mutants preserved their functional integrity regarding ligand binding, agonist-induced arr2 recruitment and G(i)-mediated signaling. In summary, our results show that the conserved arginine cluster within the 29-amino acid insert of third cytoplasmic loop (IC3) of the D-2L-R appears to be the ER retention signal.

Michael			Seasonal variation in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors in metabolic tissues of the house sparrow (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Corticosterone; Energy mobilization hypothesis; Bird; Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis	LIFE-HISTORY; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; INSULIN INTERACT; BINDING-SITES; CORTICOSTERONE; STRESS; PROTEIN; PLASMA; MEMBRANE; GLUCOSE	Glucocorticoid hormones like corticosterone (CORT) play essential metabolic roles at both baseline and stress-induced concentrations, and CORT titers vary seasonally in patterns occurring across many different vertebrate species. It has been hypothesized that CURT may vary seasonally due to changing energy requirements at different times of year. However, hormone effects are dependent on binding to receptors in target tissues, and receptors might also vary seasonally. CURT alters metabolism primarily through binding to two receptors, the high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and low-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We quantified GR and MR in metabolic tissues (liver, kidney, omental and subcutaneous fat, and gastrocnemius and pectoralis muscle) of wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to assess these tissues' capacity to respond to CURT-mediated metabolic demands. We quantified receptors using radioligand binding assays in early and late winter, pre-egg-laying, breeding, late breeding and molt (n = 12 at each stage). MR binding did not vary significantly in any tissue over the course of the year. Because MR is associated with baseline CURT effects, this suggests that changing hormone titers may primarily regulate baseline CURT effects on metabolism. Seasonal modulation of GR binding occurred in every tissue but omental fat, though peak receptor density did not coincide with peak stress-induced CURT concentrations measured previously. Because GR is associated with stress-induced CURT effects, these data demonstrate seasonal patterns in stress-induced CURT are not driven by metabolic needs alone, although at different times of year sparrows may vary which tissue types respond to increased energy demands resulting from exposure to stressors.

Characterization of a recombinant humanized anti-cocaine monoclonal antibody and its Fab fragment	HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS			English	Article						cocaine; Fab fragment; fluorescence quenching; heterogeneity; high performance ion exchange chromatography; ligand binding; monoclonal antibody; non-equilibrium pH gel electrophoresis	CHEMICAL-MODIFICATIONS; LIQUID-CHROMATOGRAPHY; IGG MOLECULES; LC-MS; PROTEINS; 4-(AMINOSULFONYL)-7-FLUORO-2,1,3-BENZOXADIAZOLE; REDUCTION; BRAIN	Variations of post-translational modifications are important for stability and in vivo behavior of therapeutic antibodies. A recombinant humanized anti-cocaine monoclonal antibody (h2E2) was characterized for heterogeneity of N-linked glycosylation and disulfide bonds. In addition, charge heterogeneity, which is partially due to the presence or absence of C-terminal lysine on the heavy chains, was examined. For cocaine overdose therapy, Fab fragments may be therapeutic, and thus, a simplified method of generation, purification, and characterization of the Fab fragment generated by Endoproteinase Lys-C digestion was devised. Both the intact h2E2 antibody and purified Fab fragments were analyzed for their affinities for cocaine and 2 of its metabolites, benzoylecgonine and cocaethylene, by fluorescence quenching of intrinsic antibody tyrosine and tryptophan fluorescence resulting from binding of these drugs. Binding constants obtained from fluorescence quenching measurements are in agreement with recently published radioligand and ELISA binding assays. The dissociation constants determined for the h2E2 monoclonal and its Fab fragment are approximately 1, 5, and 20 nM for cocaethylene, cocaine, and benzoylecgonine, respectively. Tryptophan fluorescence quenching (emission at 330 nm) was measured after either excitation of tyrosine and tryptophan (280 nm) or selective excitation of tryptophan alone (295 nm). More accurate binding constants are obtained using tryptophan selective excitation at 295 nm, likely due to interfering absorption of cocaine and metabolites at 280 nm. These quenching results are consistent with multiple tryptophan and tyrosine residues in or near the predicted binding location of cocaine in a previously published 3-D model of this antibody's variable region.

All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with Karolinska Institutet's guidelines and were approved by the local laboratory animal ethics committee. We used clinical neurointerventional systems to place microcatheters in the extra- or intracranial carotid artery of 15 Sprague-Dawley rats. Here, injection dynamics of iodine contrast was assessed using digital subtraction angiography. Maintaining the catheter position, the animals were placed in a micro PET and small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) was used to analyze injections [2-F-18]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (F-18-FDG). Microcatheters had to be placed in the intracranial carotid artery (iICA) for the infusate to distribute to the brain. Selective injection via the iICA resulted in a 9-fold higher uptake of F-18-FDG in the injected hemisphere (p < 0.005) compared to both intravenous and more proximal carotid artery injections. Furthermore, selective injection gave a dramatically improved contrast between the brain and extracranial tissue. Intra-arterial injection increases the cerebral uptake of a radiotracer dramatically compared to systemic injection. This technique has potential applications for endovascular treatment of malignancies allowing intra-interventional modifications of injection strategy, based on information on tumor perfusion and risk to surrounding normal parenchyma. Furthermore the technique may increase diagnostic sensitivity and avoid problems due to peripheral pharmacological barriers and first passage metabolism of labile tracers.

Cannabidivarin-rich cannabis extracts are anticonvulsant in mouse and rat via a CB<sub>1</sub> receptor-independent mechanism	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						seizure; epilepsy; cannabinoid; cannabidivarin; cannabidiol; anticonvulsant; tolerability; isobologram; radioligand binding assays	TEMPORAL-LOBE; PLANT CANNABINOIDS; ABSENCE EPILEPSY; ANIMAL-MODELS; IN-VITRO; SEIZURES; DELTA(9)-TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL; INHIBITION; MICE; TETRAHYDROCANNABINOL	Background and PurposeEpilepsy is the most prevalent neurological disease and is characterized by recurrent seizures. Here, we investigate (i) the anticonvulsant profiles of cannabis-derived botanical drug substances (BDSs) rich in cannabidivarin (CBDV) and containing cannabidiol (CBD) in acute in vivo seizure models and (ii) the binding of CBDV BDSs and their components at cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Experimental ApproachThe anticonvulsant profiles of two CBDV BDSs (50-422mgkg(-1)) were evaluated in three animal models of acute seizure. Purified CBDV and CBD were also evaluated in an isobolographic study to evaluate potential pharmacological interactions. CBDV BDS effects on motor function were also investigated using static beam and grip strength assays. Binding of CBDV BDSs to cannabinoid CB1 receptors was evaluated using displacement binding assays. Key ResultsCBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in the pentylenetetrazole (100mgkg(-1)) and audiogenic seizure models (87mgkg(-1)), and suppressed pilocarpine-induced convulsions (100mgkg(-1)). The isobolographic study revealed that the anticonvulsant effects of purified CBDV and CBD were linearly additive when co-administered. Some motor effects of CBDV BDSs were observed on static beam performance; no effects on grip strength were found. The (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and (9)-tetrahydrocannabivarin content of CBDV BDS accounted for its greater affinity for CB1 cannabinoid receptors than purified CBDV. Conclusions and ImplicationsCBDV BDSs exerted significant anticonvulsant effects in three models of seizure that were not mediated by the CB1 cannabinoid receptor and were of comparable efficacy with purified CBDV. These findings strongly support the further clinical development of CBDV BDSs for the treatment of epilepsy.	[Hill, T. D. M.; Whalley, B. J.; Hill, A.

Brevenal, a brevetoxin antagonist from <i>Karenia brevis</i>, binds to a previously unreported site on mammalian sodium channels	HARMFUL ALGAE			English	Article						Brevenal; Brevetoxin; Radioligand assay; Competition binding assay	AEROSOLIZED BREVETOXINS; MARINE DINOFLAGELLATE; RECEPTOR; TOXIN; GYMNODINIUM; DERIVATIVES; TOXICITY; EXPOSURE; MODEL	Brevetoxins are a family of ladder-frame polyether toxins produced by the marine dinoflagellate Karenia brevis. During blooms of K. brevis, inhalation of brevetoxins aerosolized by wind and wave action can lead to asthma-like symptoms in persons at the beach. Consumption of either shellfish or finfish contaminated by K. brevis blooms can lead to the development of neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. The toxic effects of brevetoxins are due to binding at a defined site on, and subsequent activation of, voltage-sensitive sodium channels (VSSCs) in cell membranes (site 5). In addition to brevetoxins, K. brevis produces several other ladder-frame compounds. One of these compounds, brevenal, has been shown to antagonize the effects of brevetoxin. In an effort to further characterize the effects of brevenal, a radioactive analog ([H-3]-brevenol) was produced by reducing the terminal aldehyde moiety of brevenal to an alcohol using tritiated sodium borohydride. A K-D of 67 nM and B-max of 7.1 pmol/mg protein were obtained for [H-3]-brevenol in rat brain synaptosomes, suggesting a 1:1 matching with VSSCs. Brevenal and brevenol competed for [H-3]-brevenol binding with K-i values of 75 nM and 56 nM, respectively. However, although both brevenal and brevenol inhibited brevetoxin binding, brevetoxin was completely ineffective at competition for [H-3]-brevenol binding. After examining other site-specific compounds, it was determined that [H-3]-brevenol binds to a site that is distinct from the other known sites on the sodium channel, including the brevetoxin site, (site 5) although some interaction with site 5 is apparent.

Although non-adrenergic, imidazoline (I) receptors have been revealed in human platelets, there is limited information about imidazoline's action on platelet aggregation. This study aimed to investigate aggregatory and anti-aggregatory effects of various imidazoline or non-imidazoline alpha-adrenergic agents on rabbit platelets. Methods: Aggregatory responses of agents on rabbit platelets were examined by turbidimetric method. Radioligand binding assay to platelet I-1 and I-2 receptors was performed using [H-3]-clonidine and [H-3]-idazoxan, respectively. Results: Aggregation was not induced by alpha-adrenoceptor agonists alone. Adrenaline and noradrenaline produced dose-dependent potentiation of ADP- or collagen-induced aggregation. Imidazoline adrenoceptor agonists clonidine and p-aminoclonidine also potentiated ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonists and/or certain imidazoline adrenergic agents inhibited adrenaline-potentiated aggregation in a dose-dependent manner, whereas alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists and non-imidazoline alpha-adrenergic agents were either ineffective or less effective in inhibiting adrenaline-potentiated aggregation. Rabbit platelets did not have I-1 receptors, but had I-2 receptors, indicating that adrenaline-potentiated platelet aggregation was inhibited by idazoxan, but not by imidazoline compounds clonidine and oxymetazoline. Conclusions/Implications: These results demonstrated that alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-blocking agents and/or imidazoline alpha-adrenergic agents effectively inhibit adrenaline-potentiated platelet aggregation. It is proposed that imidazoline structure in part plays a role in the inhibition of adrenaline-potentiated aggregation. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

The Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonist Almorexant Induces Sleep and Decreases Orexin-Induced Locomotion by Blocking Orexin 2 Receptors	SLEEP			English	Article						Orexin; hypocretin; mouse; sleep mechanisms; locomotion	PROMOTES WAKEFULNESS; KNOCKOUT MICE; REM-SLEEP; HYPOCRETIN; NARCOLEPSY; NEURONS; CATAPLEXY; PEPTIDES; EXPRESSION; DISCHARGE	Study Objectives: Orexin peptides activate orexin 1 and orexin 2 receptors (OX1R and OX2R), regulate locomotion and sleep-wake. The dual OX1R/OX2R antagonist almorexant reduces activity and promotes sleep in multiple species, including man. The relative contributions of the two receptors in locomotion and sleep/wake regulation were investigated in mice. Design: Mice lacking orexin receptors were used to determine the contribution of OX1R and OX2R to orexin A-induced locomotion and to almorexant-induced sleep. Setting: N/A. Patients or Participants: C57BL/6J mice and OX1R+/+, OX1R-/-, OX2R+/+, OX2R-/- and OX1R-/-/OX2R-/- mice. Interventions: Intracerebroventricular orexin A; oral dosing of almorexant. Measurements and Results: Almorexant attenuated orexin A-induced locomotion. As in other species, almorexant dose-dependently increased rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and nonREM sleep in mice. Almorexant and orexin A were ineffective in OX1R-/-/OX2R-/- mice. Both orexin Ainduced locomotion and sleep induction by almorexant were absent in OX2R-/- mice. Interestingly, almorexant did not induce cataplexy in wild-type mice under conditions where cataplexy was seen in mice lacking orexins and in OX1R-/-/OX2R-/- mice. Almorexant dissociates very slowly from OX2R as measured functionally and in radioligand binding. Under non equilibrium conditions in vitro, almorexant was a dual antagonist whereas at equilibrium, almorexant became OX2R selective. Conclusions: In vivo, almorexant specifically inhibits the actions of orexin A. The two known orexin receptors mediate sleep induction by almorexant and orexin A-induced locomotion. However, OX2R activation mediates locomotion induction by orexin A and antagonism of OX2R is sufficient to promote sleep in mice.

We investigated the chronic effects of aripiprazole (ARI) on dopamine sensitivity. Methods: We administered ARI (1.5 mg/kg/d), haloperidol (HAL; 0.75 mg/kg/d), or vehicle (VEH) via minipump for 14 days to drug-naive rats or to rats pre-treated with HAL (0.75 mg/kg/d) or VEH via minipump for 14 days. On the seventh day following treatment cessation, we examined the effects of the treatment conditions on the locomotor response to methamphetamine and on striatal D-2 receptor density (N = 4-10/condition/experiment). Results: Chronic treatment with HAL led to significant increases in locomotor response and D-2 receptor density, compared with the effects of chronic treatment with either VEH or ARI; there were no significant differences in either locomotor response or D-2 density between the VEH- and ARI-treated groups. We also investigated the effects of chronic treatment with HAL, ARI, or VEH preceded by HAL or VEH treatment on locomotor response and D-2 density. ANOVA analysis indicated that the rank ordering of groups for both locomotor response and D-2 density was HAL-HAL > HAL-VEH > HAL-ARI > VEH-VEH. Conclusions: Chronic treatment with ARI prevents development of dopamine supersensitivity and potentially supersensitivity psychosis, suggesting that by reducing excessive sensitivity to dopamine and by stabilizing sensitivity for an extended period of time, ARI may be helpful for some patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia.

Buprenorphine Metabolites, Buprenorphine-3-glucuronide and Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide, Are Biologically Active	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							OPIOID RECEPTOR; IN-VIVO; INTRAVENOUS BUPRENORPHINE; RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION; INHIBITORS; MORPHINE-6-GLUCURONIDE; ANTIRETROVIRALS; PHARMACOLOGY; ACTIVATION; DELTA	Background: The long-lasting high-affinity opioid buprenorphine has complex pharmacology, including ceiling effects with respect to analgesia and respiratory depression. Plasma concentrations of the major buprenorphine metabolites norbuprenorphine, buprenorphine-3-glucuronide, and norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide approximate or exceed those of the parent drug. Buprenorphine glucuronide metabolites pharmacology is undefined. This investigation determined binding and pharmacologic activity of the two glucuronide metabolites, and in comparison with buprenorphine and norbuprenorphine. Methods: Competitive inhibition of radioligand binding to human mu, kappa, and delta opioid and nociceptin receptors was used to determine glucuronide binding affinities for these receptors. Common opiate effects were assessed in vivo in Swiss-Webster mice. Antinociception was assessed using a tail-flick assay, respiratory effects were measured using unrestrained whole-body plethysmography, and sedation was assessed by inhibition of locomotion measured by open-field testing. Results: Buprenorphine-3-glucuronide had high affinity for human mu(Ki [inhibition constant] = 4.9 +/- 2.7 pM), delta (Ki = 270 +/- 0.4 nM), and nociceptin (Ki = 36 +/- 0.3 mu M) but not kappa receptors. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide had affinity for human kappa (Ki = 300 +/- 0.5 nM) and nociceptin (Ki = 18 +/- 0.2 mu M) but not mu or delta receptors. At the dose tested, buprenorphine-3-glucuronide had a small antinociceptive effect. Neither glucuronide had significant effects on respiratory rate, but norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide decreased tidal volume. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide also caused sedation. Conclusions: Both glucuronide metabolites of buprenorphine are biologically active at doses relevant to metabolite exposures, which occur after buprenorphine. Activity of the glucuronides may contribute to the overall pharmacology of buprenorphine.

This study presents in vivo (Positron Emission Tomography (PET)) and in vitro (autoradiography) measurements of mGluR5 densities in the same rats and evaluates both noninvasive and blood-dependent pharmacokinetic models for the quantification of [C-11]ABP688 binding. Eleven rats underwent [C-11]ABP688 PET scans. In five animals, baseline scans were compared with blockade experiments with the antagonist 1,2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP), and arterial blood samples were drawn and corrected for metabolites. Afterward, saturation-binding autoradiography was performed. Blocking with MPEP resulted in an average decrease of the total distribution volume (V-T) between 43% and 58% (thalamus and caudate-putamen, respectively) but had no significant effect on cerebellar V-T (mean reduction: -0.01%). Comparing binding potential (BPND) based on the V-T with noninvasively determined BPND revealed an average negative bias of 0.7% in the caudate-putamen and an average positive bias of 3.1% in the low-binding regions. Scan duration of 50 minutes is required. The cerebellum is a suitable reference region for the quantification of mGluR(5) availability as measured with [C-11]ABP688 PET in rats. Blood-based and reference region-based PET quantification shows a significant linear relationship to autoradiographic determinations.

We identified a novel interaction site, N760 in TM5, which negatively regulates activation of mGluR1 with a newly discovered selective mGluR1 antagonist, 3-cyclohexyl-5-fluoro-6-methyl-7-(2-morpholinA-ylethoxy)-4H-chromen-4-one (CFMMC). CFMMC inhibited L-glutamate-induced intracellular Ca2+ mobilization ([Ca2+](i)) in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing recombinant human mGluR1 a with IC50 value of 50 nM, whereas it did not inhibit [Ca2+](i) in CHO cells expressing human mGluR5a [IC50: >10 mu M). To identify the amino acid residues critical for antagonism of CFMMC, we constructed various point mutants of human mGluR1 and evaluated them in [Ca2+](i) assays. The inhibitory effects of CFMMC were significantly affected in point mutations of either I725 in TM4 or N760 in TM5, as well as mutations of W798, F801 and Y805 in TM6 or T815 in TM7. Further studies revealed that antagonistic activities of not only CFMMC but also other, structurally unrelated, mGluR1 antagonists such as 6-amino-N-cyclohexyl-N,3-dimethylthiazolo[3,2-a]benzimidazole-2-carboxamide (YM-298198) and Compound 1 were reduced in N760 mutated mGluR1a. These results indicate that some mGluR1 allosteric antagonists require N760 in TM5 to demonstrate negative modulation of mGluR1 in addition to the reported amino acid residues in TM6 and TM7.

The amyloid-imaging positron emission tomography (PET) tracer [C-11]PIB (N-methyl[C-11]2-(4'-methylaminophenyl)-6-hydroxy-benzothiazole) is used in the assessment of A beta deposits in the human brain. [C-11]PIB-amyloid interaction and insoluble A beta 40 and A beta 42 peptide levels in the brain were quantified in postmortem tissue from nine AD patients and nine age-matched control subjects in the temporal, frontal and parietal cortices and the cerebellum. Autoradiographical studies showed significantly higher densities of specific [C-11]PIB-amyloid binding in gray matter in the temporal and parietal cortex (62 fmol/mg tissue) in AD patients as compared to control subjects, whereas the density was somewhat lower in the frontal cortex (56 fmol/mg tissue). No specific binding could be detected in the AD cerebellum or in the tissues from the control subjects (<= 5 fmol/mg tissue). Insoluble A beta 40 and total A beta levels (i.e. sum of A beta 40 and A beta 42) were significantly higher in patients than in controls in all measured cortical regions as determined using ELISA, which was confirmed using immunohistochemistry. The present findings show a more regional selective distribution of [C-11]PIB amyloid binding than previously reported. Moreover, it is suggested that some of the [C-11]PIB binding and insoluble A beta seen in control subjects may be amyloid in the blood vessels. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Do gene polymorphisms alone or in combination affect the function of human β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptors?

The corresponding gene is polymorphic, and the W64R (Trp64Arg) single nucleotide polymorphism has been associated with disease states such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and bladder dysfunction. While these clinical data suggest that the 64R variant is hypofunctional, previous in vitro studies in which this variant was generated by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent transfection have not consistently confirmed this. Experimental approach: We transfected the wild-type human beta(3)-adrenoceptor and the 64R variant and also the more recently discovered 265M and 306F variants as well as 64R/265M and 64R/306F double mutants into human embryonic kidney cells and selected clones expressing the receptors at a density of about 100 fmol mg protein(-1). Receptor activation was measured by cAMP accumulation and ligand affinity by radioligand binding. Desensitisation was assessed as alterations of cAMP responses after prolonged agonist treatment. Key results: Neither mutated receptor exhibited alterations in efficacy or potency for cAMP accumulation for any of five agonists (isoprenaline, noradrenaline, YM 178, FK 4664, CGP 12 177). In competition binding studies, the mutations did not affect the ability of any agonist to bind to the receptor. Wild-type receptors and the 64R variant exhibited similar isoprenaline-induced functional desensitization during a 24 h treatment. Conclusions and implications: None of the polymorphisms tested here significantly altered the interaction of isoprenaline, noradrenaline, YM 178, FK 4664 or CGP 12 177 with the human beta(3)-adrenoceptor when expressed at near physiological levels in a human cell line.

It is associated with a range of adverse consequences for human health, economic productivity and quality of life. In animal and human studies, administration of melatonin has been reported to promote sleep, although there has been controversy regarding its effectiveness. The present study used a chronically implanted radiotelemetry transmitter to record electroencephalogram (EEG) and electromyogram (EMG) to enable discrimination of wake (W), nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep in un-restrained rats. The acute action of melatonin and ramelteon, a melatonin agonist recently approved for long-term treatment of insomnia in the USA, was examined. Radioligand binding assays on recombinant human MT(1)/MT(2) receptors showed that both the melatonin and ramelteon were both high affinity, nonsubtype selective ligands. Both compounds acted as potent full agonists on a cellular model of melatonin action, the pigment aggregation response in Xenopus laevis melanophores. Both melatonin and ramelteon (10 mg/kg, i/p), administered close to the mid-point of the dark phase of the L:D cycle, significantly reduced NREM sleep latency (time from injection to the appearance of NREM sleep). Both the drugs also produced a short-lasting increase in NREM sleep duration, but the NREM power spectrum was unaltered. Neither drug altered REM latency, REM sleep duration nor power spectrum during REM sleep. In conclusion, ramelteon administration, like melatonin, exerted an acute, short-lasting sleep-promoting effect in the rat, the model most commonly used to evaluate the activity of novel hypnotic drugs.

However, the binding of ACE inhibitors to the B(1)Rs has never been directly evaluated. Information about binding of a radiolabeled inhibitor to natural or recombinant ACE in intact cells (physiologic ionic composition) was also collected. We used the tritiated form of an ACE inhibitor previously proposed to activate the B1R, enalaprilat, to address these questions using recombinant human B(1)Rs and naturally expressed or recombinant ACE. [H-3]Lys-des-Arg(9)-BK bound to the human recombinant B(1)Rs with high affinity (K-D 0.35 nM) in HEK 293a cells. [H-3]Enalaprilat (0.25-10 nM) did not bind to cells expressing recombinant human B1R, but bound with a subnanomolar affinity to recombinant ACE or to naturally expressed ACE in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The radioligand was further validated using a binding competition assay that involved unlabeled ACE inhibitors or their prodrug forms in endothelial cells. Membranes of HEK 293a cells that expressed B(1)Rs did not hydrolyze hippurylglycylglycine (an ACE substrate). Enalaprilat did not stimulate calcium signaling in HEK 293a cells that expressed B(1)Rs. A typical ACE inhibitor did not bind to nor stimulate the human B(1)Rs; nevertheless, several other indirect mechanisms could connect ACE inhibition to B1R stimulation in vivo. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, we have examined the differences in the distribution of mRNAs/receptor binding sites in the atrial samples of the heart rich in ganglion cells vs. those are virtually free of them. Binding sites and mRNAs of muscarinic receptors and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors differ in their distribution in different heart regions. The mRNAs for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors were almost equally distributed herein, while the amount of P-adrenoceptors significantly differs in the heart regions. The alpha(1A)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptors mRNAs were also found in all investigated heart regions, but at significantly lower level and have not shown region differences. This is a new finding, especially to beta(3)-adrenoceptors, as they were not regularly found in each heart regions. alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors have similar distribution of their mRNAs and binding sites in some heart parts. Thus, we can conclude that there are noticeable differences in the presence of receptors in heart regions that contain ganglion cells in comparison to those are virtually free of them.

Binding of the radioligand [F-18]MPPF to 5HT(IA) receptors is sensitive to levels of endogenous serotonin. In this study, we aimed to demonstrate changes in serotonin receptor availability in the human brain in wakefulness and sleep using [F-18]MPPF and positron emission tomography. 14 subjects with narcolepsy cataplexy underwent [F-18]MPPF PET scans in wakefulness and in sleep. Subjects who used the stimulant methylphenidate took their normal medication for the wake scan but omitted it prior to the sleep scan. The change in binding potential (BP) between the sleep and wake scans was examined using paired t test. Methylphenidate is thought to have little or no effect on serotonergic neurotransmission, and in order to confirm the absence of all effect oil [F-18]MPPF binding, a concurrent study was performed using a beta-microprobe technique to examine the effect of methylphenidate administration on [F-18]MPPF binding in Sprague-DawleN rats. The human study showed a significant increase in [F-18]MPPF binding in sleep compared to wakefulness in the whole brain and all regions of interest examined (temporal cortex, mesial temporal region and cingulate cortex). The microprobe study confirmed that methylphenidate administration had no effect on [F-18]MPPF binding. These findings indicate that scrotonin receptor availability is increased in sleep compared to wakefulness in narcoleptic humans. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Blockade of mu-opiate receptors with naltrexone reduces the relapse risk among some but not all alcoholic individuals. Objective: To test the hypothesis that alcohol craving is pronounced among alcoholic individuals with a high availability of mu-opiate receptors in the brain reward system. Design: Patients and comparison sample. The availability of central mu-opiate receptors was measured in vivo with positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand carbon 11-labeled carfentanil in the ventral striatum and compared with the severity of alcohol craving as assessed by the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS). Setting: Hospitalized care. Participants: Volunteer sample of 25 male alcohol-dependent inpatients assessed after detoxification of whom 12 underwent PET again 5 weeks later. Control group of 10 healthy men. Main Outcome Measures: After I to 3 weeks of abstinence, the availability of mu-opiate receptors in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, was significantly elevated in alcoholic patients compared with healthy controls and remained elevated when 12 alcoholic patients had these levels measured 5 weeks later (P<.05 corrected for multiple testing). Higher availability of mu-opiate receptors in this brain area correlated significantly with the intensity of alcohol craving as assessed by the OCDS. Conclusions: Abstinent alcoholic patients displayed an increase in mu-opiate receptors in the ventral striatum, including the nucleus accumbens, which correlated with the severity of alcohol craving. These findings point to a neuronal correlate of alcohol urges.

Contractility and relaxation studies were performed on guinea pig atrial myocardium, pulmonary artery, and thoracic aorta to compare the pharmacological effects of NECA and F-NECA (a non-emitting derivative) on tissues. Furthermore, the effect of NECA and F-NECA on the potassium conductance was investigated in DDT1 MF-2 smooth muscle cells with the patch-clamp technique. Both NECA and F-NECA reduced the contractile force in atrial myocardium and evoked phasic contraction in pulmonary artery (A(1) adenosine-receptor-mediated actions) in a dose dependent manner; however, the apparent affinity was lower for F-NECA. No difference was found in relaxation induced by these compounds in 1 muM noradrenaline-precontracted aorta and pulmonary artery (in the presence of DPCPX, an A(1) adenosine receptor antagonist, tissue containing A(2B) adenosine receptors). NECA (5 muM) and F-NECA (5 muM) also decreased the peak current and accelerated activation and inactivation properties of the potassium channels, but F-NECA was less effective. These results suggest that while NECA and F-NECA are equivalent agonists of vascular A(2B) receptors, they mediate different changes of some parameters. When evaluating the data obtained by the use of radiolabelled ligands, one has to take into consideration the possible physiological effects of the ligands besides its binding properties to tissues.

The role of the mesolimbic DA in brain ethanol reinforcement is well established, with nucleus accumbens (NAC) serving as a major terminal area of this system, whereas dorsal striatum is more associated with motor control. The aim of this study was to compare putative age-related alterations of dopamine transporters (DAT) in dorsal and ventral striatum of healthy controls and alcoholics. We studied the effect of age on DAT in caudate (NC), putamen (Pu), and nucleus accumbens (NAC) of eight type 1 and 2 alcoholics and 10 healthy controls by using [(125I)] PE2I as a radioligand for postmortem human whole hemisphere autoradiography. In the type 1 alcoholic group age and DAT density did not correlate significantly with any of the structures studied. The mean densities of DAT declined significantly with age in controls and type 2 alcoholics in dorsal striatum (NC, Pu) (range of correlation coefficient from -0.49 to -0.94), but not statistically significantly in NAC. In type 1 alcoholics the lack of correlation between DAT density and age may indicate a preexisting dopaminergic deficit in this patient group, whereas age-related decline among type 2 alcoholics resembled that of healthy controls. Furthermore, dorsal striatal DAT may be more vulnerable to age-related decline than DAT in NAC. This is supported by the notion that DAT in NAC and dorsal striatum have different molecular weights.

Agonist-promoted internalization of some GPCRs has been shown to mediate receptor desensitization, resensitization, and down-regulation. In this study, we investigated whether different mu opioid agonists displayed different effects in receptor internalization and recycling, the potential mechanisms involved in ohmefentanyl-induced internalization process. In transfected SO insect cells expressing 6His-tagged wild type mu opioid receptor, exposure to 100 nM ohmefentanyl caused a maximum internalization of the receptor at 30 min and receptors seemed to reappear at the cell membrane after 60 min as determined by radioligand binding assay. Ohmefentanyl-induced human mu opioid receptor internalization was concentration-dependent, with about 40% of the receptors internalized following a 30-min exposure to 1 muM ohmefentanyl. 10 muM morphine and 1 muM DAMGO could also induce about 40% internalization. The antagonist naloxone and pretreatment with pertussis toxin both blocked ohmefentanyl-induced internalization without affecting internalization themselves. Incubation with sucrose 0.45 M significantly inhibited ohmefentanyl-induced internalization of the mu receptor. The removal of agonists ohmefentanyl and morphine resulted in the receptors gradually returning to the cell surface over a 60 min period, while the removal of agonist DAMGO only partly resulted in the receptor recycling. The results of this study suggest that ohmefentanyl-induced internalization of human mu opioid receptor in Sf9 insect cells occurs via Gi/o protein-dependent process that likely involves clathrin-coated pits. In addition, the recycling process displays the differential modes of action of different agonists. (C) 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.

Radioligand binding of [H-3]5-carboxamidotryptamine ([H-3]5-CT) to membranes and stimulation of [H-3]cAMP formation in whole cells evoked by 5-HT receptor agonists were determined. Maximum binding (B-max) to, and affinity (K-D) of [H-3]5-CT for, the variant receptor and the wild-type receptor were equal. All agonists and antagonists investigated exhibited no differences in affinity between the variant receptor and the wild-type receptor. However, the intrinsic activity of the 5-HT receptor agonists 5-HT, 5-CT, RU24969 and 8-OH-DPAT in stimulating [H-3]cAMP accumulation in the cells expressing the Pro(279)Leu variant was almost abolished and their potency was 2.9-4.3-fold lower. Despite its affinity for both receptor isoforms, sumatriptan did not stimulate the accumulation of cAMP. In individuals expressing the Pro(279)Leu variant of the h5-HT7(a) receptor, a considerable attenuation of its function may be predicted. This may have relevance for the action of new classes of drugs which affect circadian rhythm or psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia.

The affinio, label derivatives were prepared using standard Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis in conjunction with Fmoc-Phe(p-NHAlloc) (Fmoc: 9-flourenylmethoxycarbonyl;) and selective modification of the p-amino group on this residue. The electrophilic isothiocyanate and bromoacetamide groups were introduced into the para position of Phe(4); the corresponding free amine-containing peptides were also prepared for comparison. The pure peptides were evaluated in radioligand binding assays using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing delta and mu opioid receptors. Modification of Phe(4) in LeuEnk and DTLET significantly decreased delta-receptor binding affinity (40 to >2,000-fold). Among the synthesized analogues, [Phe(p-NH2)(4)]DTLET showed the highest delta-receptor binding affinity (IC50 = 39 nM) and enhanced selectivity for delta receptors compared to DTLET while other derivatives exhibited much lower delta receptor affinity. The differences in affinities between the two series of analogues and between the derivatives of LeuEnk and N,N-dibenzyl[Leu(5)]Enk reported previously suggest subtle differences in interactions of Phe(4) with delta receptors depending on other modifications in the sequences.

Opiate receptor-mediated activation of G-proteins by these derivatives was also investigated using the [S-35]GTPgammaS binding assay. The receptor binding affinity constant and G-protein stimulatory potency of the novel 13-etorphins were compared with those of the corresponding C18-alpha-derivatives. In rat brain membrane preparations, all the compounds tested displayed high affinity (K-i's ranging 0.4-22 nM) using [H-3]naloxone in competition assays. The alpha-etorphines had somewhat higher affinity in comparison with the beta-structures. Methylether derivatives were consistently weaker than the corresponding phenolic compounds. Dihydroetorphine and beta-dihydroetorphine, which have a partially saturated ring structure, showed as good potency in the binding assays as did etorphine and beta-etorphine with C7-C8 double bonds. The etorphine derivatives were potent but naloxone-reversible activators of G-proteins in the [S-35]GTPgammaS functional tests. It was also found that the C3 phenolic group is favourable for G-protein activation. On the basis of our experimental results, neither the configuration of C18 nor the saturation of the C7-C8 double bond appears to play a critical role in the biological activity of etorphines.

In this study the authors used positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18]altanserin, a ligand with high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor, to examine the relationship between 5-HT2A receptor density and age in more detail. Method: The 22 subjects ranged in age from 21 to 69 years (mean=43.4, SD= 13.3) and were healthy comparison subjects in a study of depression. Regions of interest were determined on magnetic resonance images and were transferred to coregistered PET data. The data were derived from dynamic PET scanning and arterial sampling with resulting plasma activity data corrected for labeled metabolites. Compartmental modeling was used to estimate the radioligand distribution volume. By comparing the distribution volume (DM) of different regions to the cerebellum distribution volume, DVratio-1, which is proportional to the binding potential, was calculated. Results: The decrease in 5-HT2A binding was not linear but on average was approximately 17% per decade from age 20. The correlations between age and 5-HT2A DVratio-1 were significant for the global measure and for the medial gyrus rectus, anterior cingulate, posterior medial prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and occipital cortex. Most of the falloff in receptor binding occurred up through midlife, and there was less decrease in late life. There were no decreases in regional brain volumes of corresponding magnitudes. Conclusions: 5-HT2A receptor binding decreases dramatically in a variety of brain regions up through midlife.

Here, the interaction of HMR 1883 with sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subtypes and recombinant K-ATP channels is compared with that of the standard sulfonylurea, glibenclamide, in radioligand receptor binding and electrophysiological experiments. HMR 1883 and glibenclamide inhibited [H-3]glibenclamide binding to SUR1 with K-i values of 63 muM and 1.5 nM, and [H-3]opener binding to SUR2A/2B with K-i values of 14/44 muM and 0.5/2.8 muM, respectively (values at 1 mM MgATP). The interaction of HMR 1883 with the SUR2 subtypes was more sensitive to inhibition by MgATP and MgADP than that of glibenclamide. In inside-out patches and in the absence of nucleotides, HMR 1883 inhibited the recombinant KAT, channels from heart (Kir6.2/SUR2A) and nonvascular smooth muscle (Kir6.2/SUR2B) with IC50 values of 0.38 and 1.2 muM, respectively; glibenclamide did not discriminate between these channels (IC50 similar to 0.026 muM). In whole cells, the recombinant vascular K-ATP channel, Kir6.1/SUR2B, was inhibited by HMR 1883 and glibenclamide with IC50 values of 5.3 and 0.043 muM, respectively. The data show that the sulfonylthiourea exhibits a selectivity profile quite different from that of glibenclamide with a major loss of affinity toward SUR1 and slight preference for SUR2A. The stronger inhibition by nucleotides of HMR 1883 binding to SUR2 (as compared with glibenclamide) makes the sulfonylthiourea an interesting tool for further investigation.

Pharmacological doses of dopamine have been shown to modulate T cell functions significantly, but no information is available on the effect of physiological concentrations of circulating dopamine on CD4+ and CD8+ T cell functions. This information may be of importance since significantly elevated plasma dopamine levels were observed in humans during uncoping stress, and suppression of T cell functions during stress is a well-known phenomenon. However, the mechanism inducing the suppression of T cell functions during stress is not yet clear. In the present investigation, we evaluated the effect of the dopamine level attained in the plasma of individuals with uncoping stress on the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro. Methods: T cell subpopulations were separated by panning. The effect of dopamine on IL-2-induced cell proliferation in vitro was evaluated by [H-3]thymidine incorporation and cytotoxicity by Cr-51 release, receptors by radioligand binding, cAMP by an assay kit and apoptosis by DNA fragmentation. Results: At these elevated physiological concentrations, dopamine was found to inhibit significantly the proliferation and cytotoxicity of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro. This dopamine-mediated inhibition of proliferation was more marked on CD8+ T cells than on CD4+ T cells. The underlying mechanism was found to be D1 class of dopamine-receptor-mediated stimulation of intracellular cAMP. Conclusion: Results may be of significance to understand the role of peripheral dopamine in human neuroimmune communication in terms of physiological homeostasis in health and disease.

Res., 53 (1998) 107-113). In the present study we tested the presence of DA transporter (DAT) in MAEC using radioligand binding experiments. Saturation studies showed that [H-3]mazindol binds to a high affinity site with K-D and B-max values of 7.85 +/- 1.25 nM and 123.22 +/- 18.34 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Competition studies indicated that selective DAT inhibitors are potent displacers of [H-3]mazindol binding, compared to inhibitors of other types of transporters. The rank order of potency of the competing drugs is consistent with the pharmacology of DAT. These results provide, for the first time, clear evidence that MAEC natively possess DAT binding sites and suggest that MAEC may provide a potential primate cell model to study DA release and uptake processes and to explore new drugs active at this site.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]Fluoropyridine-losartan: A new approach toward human Positron Emission Tomography imaging of Angiotensin II Type 1 receptors	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						automation; Cu(I) stabilizing agent THPTA; CuAAC click chemistry; fluorine-18	RADIOLIGAND; F-18	Angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)R) blocker losartan is used in patients with renal and cardiovascular diseases. [F-18]fluoropyridine-losartan has shown favorable binding profile for quantitative renal PET imaging of AT(1)R with selective binding in rats and pigs, low interference of radiometabolites and appropriate dosimetry for clinical translation. A new approach was developed to produce [F-18]fluoropyridine-losartan in very high molar activity. Automated radiosynthesis was performed in a three-step, two-pot, and two-HPLC-purification procedure within 2 h. Pure [F-18]FPyKYNE was obtained by radiofluorination of NO2PyKYNE and silica-gel-HPLC purification (40 +/- 9%), preventing the formation of nitropyridine-losartan in the second step. Conjugation with trityl-losartan azide via click chemistry, followed by acid hydrolysis, C18-HPLC purification and reformulation provided [F-18]fluoropyridine-losartan in 11 +/- 2% (decay-corrected from [F-18]fluoride, EOB). Using tris[(1-(3-hydroxypropyl)-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]-amine (THPTA) as a Cu(I)-stabilizing agent for coupling [F-18]FPyKYNE to the unprotected losartan azide afforded [F-18]fluoropyridine-losartan in similar yields (11 +/- 3%, decay-corrected from [F-18]fluoride, EOB). Reverse-phase HPLC was optimized by reducing the pH of the mobile phase to achieve complete purification and high molar activities (467 +/- 60 GBq/mu mol). The use of radioprotectants prevented tracer radiolysis for 10 h (RCP > 99%). The product passed the quality control testing. This reproducible automated radiosynthesis process will allow in vivo PET imaging of AT(1)R expression in several diseases.

The main objective of this study was to determine the 28-day test-retest repeatability (TRT) of quantitative [C-11]UCB-J brain positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls (HCs). Nine HCs and eight AD patients underwent two 60 min dynamic [C-11]UCB-J PET scans with arterial sampling with an interval of 28 days. The optimal tracer kinetic model was assessed using the Akaike criteria (AIC). Micro-/macro-parameters such as tracer delivery (K-1) and volume of distribution (V-T) were estimated using the optimal model. Data were also analysed for simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) with centrum semi-ovale (white matter) as reference region. Based on AIC, both 1T2k_V-B and 2T4k_V-B described the [C-11]UCB-J kinetics equally well. Analysis showed that whole-brain grey matter TRT for V-T, DVR and SRTM BPND were -2.2% +/- 8.5, 0.4% +/- 12.0 and -8.0% +/- 10.2, averaged over all subjects. [C-11]UCB-J kinetics can be well described by a 1T2k_V-B model, and a 60 min scan duration was sufficient to obtain reliable estimates for both plasma input and reference tissue models. TRT for V-T, DVR and BPND was <15% (1SD) averaged over all subjects and indicates adequate quantitative repeatability of [C-11]UCB-J PET.

Lutetium-177 (Lu), targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), has demonstrated promising outcomes including reduced disease progression and improved overall survival. We aim to determine overall survival demonstrated by our LuPSMA patient cohort to date. Methods Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test were performed on all LuPSMA therapy patients with at least 12 months of follow-up data available (n = 68). Comparison across patients was made based on several variables including the baseline characteristics of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level, maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) and metastasis site and by biochemical response. Results The 18-month overall survival estimate for the patient cohort was 63.8%. Patients with baseline serum PSA <20 mu g/L had a greater 18-month survival estimate (79.9%) compared to PSA >= 20 mu g/L (53.8%; P < 0.05). Patients with an SUVmax >15 had an 18-month survival estimate of 56.0%, compared to 38.0% in patients with SUVmax <= 15 (P < 0.05). No significant difference in overall survival was observed by metastasis site. Both a decrease in PSA after two LuPSMA therapy cycles and the maximum response over the treatment course being a decline in PSA were indicative of greater overall survival (P P < 0.001 respectively). Conclusion Our study reported an 18-month overall survival of 64% in patients with mCRPC who have undergone LuPSMA therapy. Our study identified that baseline serum PSA, SUVmax and biochemical response to treatment are prognostic markers for increased overall survival.

Methods 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) brain PET imaging was performed for evaluation of microglial activation by using the radioligand [C-11](R)-PK11195. TSPO binding was evaluated as the distribution volume ratio (DVR) from dynamic PET images. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and conventional MRI (cMRI) were performed at the same time. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean (MD), axial, and radial (RD) diffusivities were calculated within the whole normal-appearing WM (NAWM) and segmented NAWM regions appearing normal in cMRI. Fifty-five patients with MS and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were examined. Results Microstructural damage was observed in the NAWM of the MS brain. DTI parameters of patients with MS were significantly altered in the NAWM compared with an age- and sex-matched HC group: mean FA was decreased, and MD and RD were increased. These structural abnormalities correlated with increased TSPO binding in the whole NAWM and in the temporal NAWM (p< 0.05 for all correlations;p< 0.01 for RD in the temporal NAWM). Both compromised WM integrity and increased microglial activation in the NAWM correlated significantly with higher clinical disability measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale score. Conclusions Widespread structural disruption in the NAWM is linked to neuroinflammation, and both phenomena associate with clinical disability. Multimodal PET and DTI allow in vivo evaluation of widespread MS pathology not visible using cMRI.

We aimed to estimate the absorbed radiation doses for critical organs (eg, kidneys, parotid glands, submandibular glands, and lacrimal glands) of patients treated with 4 to 6 cycles by Lu-177-PSMA inhibitor RLT, retrospectively, and to evaluate the findings extensively in order to determine the critical organ radiation-absorbed limitations and the number of prospective RLT. Materials and Methods A total of 51 cycles Lu-177-PSMA inhibitor RLT in 10 patients was analyzed. Therapies have been applied in 4 to 6 cycles with 8 to 10 weeks' intervals. Dosimetric estimates of kidneys, parotid glands, submandibular glands, and lacrimal glands have been calculated based on MIRD scheme pamphlet no. 16. Regions of interest were drawn with GE Xeleris Functional Imaging Workstation. OLINDA/EXM 1.1 simulation software was used to calculate radiation-absorbed doses. Results Mean radiation-absorbed doses were 0.70 +/- 0.24 Gy/GBq for kidneys, 1.34 +/- 0.78 Gy/GBq for parotid glands, 0.94 +/- 0.45 Gy/GBq for submandibular glands, and 2.28 +/- 1.29 Gy/GBq for lacrimal glands. Conclusions Due to the critical target organ risks and the optimal therapy doses, patient-specific dosimetry is a deterministic factor in radionuclide therapy. Even when the absorbed kidney doses were above the ICRP critical dose limits in patients who had 4 to 6 cycles of therapy, mortality due to nephrotoxicity has not been observed. Mild increased tolerated radiation dose is acceptable for the patient groups with very low survival rate.

J	Sekiguchi, H; Pavey, G; Dean, B				Sekiguchi, Hirotaka; Pavey, Geoff; Dean, Brian			Altered levels of dopamine transporter in the frontal pole and dorsal striatum in schizophrenia	NPJ SCHIZOPHRENIA			English	Article							DRUG-NAIVE PATIENTS; UPTAKE SITES; IN-VIVO; PRESYNAPTIC DOPAMINE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; D2 RECEPTORS; BINDING; BRAIN; HALOPERIDOL; MARKERS	The dopamine hypothesis proposes that there is a hypodopaminergic state in the prefrontal cortex and a hyperdopaminergic state in the striatum of patients with schizophrenia. Evidence suggests the hyperdopaminergic state in the striatum is due to synaptic dopamine elevation, particularly in the dorsal striatum. However, the molecular mechanisms causing disrupted dopaminergic function in schizophrenia remains unclear. We postulated that the dopamine transporter (DAT), which regulates intra-synaptic dopamine concentrations by transporting dopamine from the synaptic cleft into the pre-synaptic neuron, could be involved in dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. Therefore, we measured levels of DAT in the cortex and striatum from patients with schizophrenia and controls using postmortem human brain tissue. Levels of desmethylimipramine-insensitive mazindol-sensitive [H-3]mazindol binding to DAT were measured using in situ radioligand binding and autoradiography in gray matter from Brodmann's area (BA) 10, BA 17, the dorsal striatum, and nucleus accumbens from 15 patients with schizophrenia and 15 controls. Levels of desmethylimipramine-insensitive mazindol-sensitive ( 3 H]mazindol binding were significantly higher in BA 10 from patients with schizophrenia (p = 0.004) and significantly lower in the dorsal striatum (dorsal putamen p= 0.005; dorsal caudate p = 0.007) from those with the disorder. There were no differences in levels of desmethylimipramine-insensitive [H-3]mazindol binding in BA 17 or nucleus accumbens. These data raise the possibility that high levels of DAT in BA 10 could be contributing to lower synaptic cortical dopamine, whereas lower levels of DAT could be contributing to a hyperdopaminergic state in the dorsal striatum.

Unfortunately, commonly used PD therapies do not repair the disconnected circuitry. It has been reported that using kainic acid (KA, an excitatory amino acid) in bridging transplantation may be useful to generate an artificial tract and reconstruct the nigrostriatal pathway in 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats. In this study, we used KA bridging and a co-graft of rat olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) and rat E14 embryonic ventral mesencephalic (VM) tissue to restore the nigrostriatal pathway of the PD model rats. The methamphetamine-induced rotational behaviour, 4-[F-18]-ADAM (a selectively serotonin transporter radioligand)/micro-PET imaging, and immunohistochemistry were used to assess the effects of the transplantation. At 9 weeks post-grafting in PD model rats, the results showed that the PD rats undergoing VM tissue and OECs co-grafts (VM-OECs) exhibited better motor recovery compared to the rats receiving VM tissue transplantation only. The striatal uptake of 4-[F-18]-ADAM and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-ir) of the grafted area in the VM-OECs group were also more improved than those of the VM alone group. These results suggested that OECs may enhance the survival of the grafted VM tissue and facilitate the recovery of motor function after VM transplantation. Moreover, OECs possibly promote the elongation of dopaminergic and serotonergic axon in the bridging graft. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Up to now, it remains unclear how SSRIs achieve their antidepressant effect. However, task-based and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging studies, have demonstrated connectivity changes between brain regions. Here, we use positron emission tomography (PET) to quantify SSRIs main target, the serotonin transporter (SERT), and assess treatment-induced molecular changes in the interregional relation of SERT binding potential (BPND). Nineteen out-patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 19 healthy controls (HC) were included in this study. Patients underwent three PET measurements with the radioligand [11C]DASB: (1) at baseline, (2) after a first SSRI dose; and (3) following at least 3 weeks of daily intake. Controls were measured once with PET. Correlation analyses were restricted to brain regions repeatedly implicated in MDD pathophysiology. After 3 weeks of daily SSRI administration a significant increase in SERT BPND correlations of anterior cingulate cortex and insula with the amygdala, midbrain, hippocampus, pallidum and putamen (p < 0.05; false discovery rate, FDR corrected) was revealed. No significant differences were found when comparing MDD patients and HC at baseline. These findings are in line with the clinical observation that treatment response to SSRIs is often achieved only after a latency of several weeks. The elevated associations in interregional SERT associations may be more closely connected to clinical outcomes than regional SERT occupancy measures and could reflect a change in the regional interaction of serotonergic neurotransmission during antidepressant treatment.

However, there has been a lack of non-peptide CX(3)CR1 inhibitors to substantiate these findings. A selective small-molecule inhibitor of CX(3)CR1, AZD8797, was recently reported and we present here an in-depth in vitro characterization of that molecule. In a flow adhesion assay, AZD8797 antagonized the natural ligand, fractalkine (CX(3)CL1), in both human whole blood (hWB) and in a B-lymphocyte cell line with IC50 values of 300 and 6 nM respectively. AZD8797 also prevented G-protein activation in a [S-35] GTP gamma S (guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio] triphosphate) accumulation assay. In contrast, dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) experiments revealed a weak G(ai)-dependent AZD8797 agonism. Additionally, AZD8797 positively modulated the CX(3)CL1 response at sub-micromolar concentrations in a beta-arrestin recruitment assay. In equilibrium saturation binding experiments, AZD8797 reduced the maximal binding of I-125-CX(3)CL1 without affecting K-d. Kinetic experiments, determining the k(on) and k(off) of AZD8797, demonstrated that this was not an artefact of irreversible or insurmountable binding, thus a true non-competitive mechanism. Finally we show that both AZD8797 and GTP. S increase the rate with which CX3CL1 dissociates from CX(3)CR1 in a similar manner, indicating a connection between AZD8797 and the CX(3)CR1-bound G-protein. Collectively, these data show that AZD8797 is a non-competitive allosteric modulator of CX(3)CL1, binding CX(3)CR1 and effecting G-protein signalling and beta-arrestin recruitment in a biased way.

Methods: The ventilatory effects of GAL-021 were characterized using tracheal pneumotachometry (n = 4 to 6), plethysmography (n = 5 to 6), arterial blood gas analyses (n = 6 to 11), and nasal capnography (n = 3 to 4) in naive animals and those subjected to morphine-induced respiratory depression. Morphine analgesia in rats was evaluated by tail-flick test (n = 6). Carotid body involvement in GAL-021 ventilatory effects was assessed by comparing responses in intact and carotid sinus nerve-transected rats. Hemodynamic effects of GAL-021 were evaluated in urethane-anesthetized rats (n = 7). The pharmacological profile of GAL-021 in vitro was investigated using radioligand binding, enzyme inhibition, and cellular electrophysiology assays. Results: GAL-021 given intravenously stimulated ventilation and/or attenuated opiate-induced respiratory depression in rats, mice, and nonhuman primates, without decreasing morphine analgesia in rats. GAL-021 did not alter mean arterial pressure but produced a modest increase in heart rate. Ventilatory stimulation in rats was attenuated by carotid sinus nerve transection. GAL-021 inhibited K(Ca)1.1 in GH3 cells, and the evoked ventilatory stimulation was attenuated in Slo1(-/-) mice lacking the pore-forming -subunit of the K(Ca)1.1 channel. Conclusions: GAL-021 behaved as a breathing control modulator in rodents and nonhuman primates and diminished opioid-induced respiratory depression without compromising opioid analgesia. It acted predominantly at the carotid body, in part by inhibiting K(Ca)1.1 channels. Its preclinical profile qualified the compound to enter clinical trials to assess effects on breathing control disorders such as drug (opioid)-induced respiratory depression and sleep apnea.

Designed compounds were synthesized and screened for affinity by a radioligand binding assay. Their functional characterization as agonists and antagonists was performed by fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay using cell lines expressing transfected cDNAs, alpha 7-nAChRs, alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs, and 5HT(3A), receptors, and a fluorescence cell reporter. In the END series, a tropane ring of TTIn-1, substituted at Ni, was replaced by mono- and bicyclic amines to vary length and conformational flexibility of a carbon linker between nitrogen atom and Ni of the triazole. Compounds with a two-carbon atom linker optimized binding with K-d's at the submicromolar level. Further modification at the hydrophobic indole of TTIn-1 was made in PPRD and QND series by fixing the amine center with the highest affinity building blocks in the IND series. Compounds from IND and PPRD series are selective as agonists for the alpha 7-nAChRs over alpha 4 beta 2-nAChRs and 5HT(3A) receptors. Lead compounds in the three series have EC50's between 28 and 260 nM. Based on the EC50, affinity, and selectivity determined from the binding and cellular responses, two of the leads have been advanced to behavioral studies described in the companion article (DOI: 10.1021/acschemneuro.5b00059).

The reasons for this are incompletely understood, but recent evidence implies that both preexisting and pain-related variations in the structure and function of the nervous system may contribute significantly to the development of chronic pain. Here, we addressed the role of striatal dopamine (DA) D2/D3 receptor (D2/D3R) function in chronic non-neuropathic back pain (CNBP) by comparing CNBP patients and healthy controls using PET and the D2/D3R-selective radioligand [C-11]raclopride. D2/D3R availability was measured at baseline and during a pain challenge, yielding in vivo measures of receptor availability (binding potential, BPND) and DA release (change in BPND from baseline to activated state). At baseline, CNBP patients demonstrated reductions in D2/D3R BPND in the ventral striatum compared with controls. These reductions were associated with greater positive affect scores and pain tolerance measures. The reductions in D2/D3R BPND were also correlated with mu-opioid receptor BPND and pain-induced endogenous opioid system activation in the amygdala, further associated with measures of positive affect, the affective component of back pain and pain tolerance. During the pain challenge, lower magnitudes of DA release, and therefore D2/D3R activation, were also found in the ventral striatum in the CNBP sample compared with controls. Our results show that CNBP is associated with adaptations in ventral striatal D2/D3R function, which, together with endogenous opioid system function, contribute to the sensory and affective-motivational features of CNBP.

The purpose of this analysis was to compare data on cortical A beta deposition in subjects who had undergone both C-11-PiB (PiB) and F-18-florbetaben (FBB) PET imaging. We identified ten healthy elderly controls (HC) and ten patients with AD who had undergone PET imaging after intravenous injection of 370 MBq of PiB and 300 MBq of FBB under separate research protocols. PiB and FBB images were coregistered so that placement of regions of interest was identical on both scans and standard uptake value ratios (SUVR) using the cerebellar cortex as reference region were calculated between 40 and 70 min and between 90 and 110 min after injection for PiB and FBB, respectively. Significantly higher SUVR values (p < 0.0001) in most cortical areas were observed in AD patients when compared with HC with both radiotracers. Global SUVR values in AD patients were on average 75% higher than in HC with PiB and 56% higher with FBB. There was an excellent linear correlation between PiB and FBB global SUVR values (r = 0.97, p < 0.0001) with similar effect sizes for distinguishing AD from HC subjects for both radiotracers (Cohen's d 3.3 for PiB and 3.0 for FBB). FBB, while having a narrower dynamic range than PiB, clearly distinguished HC from AD patients, with a comparable effect size. FBB seems a suitable F-18 radiotracer for imaging AD pathology in vivo.

Design In this report, we present the cumulative experience and clinical characteristics of six patients diagnosed with glucagonoma and the glucagonoma syndrome and treated at our centre during the past 25 years. Results Although the course of the disease was variable, some features were similar. The median age at diagnosis was 53 center dot 5 years; the median time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis was 39 months. Presenting symptoms were as follows: weight loss 5/6 (83%), necrotizing migratory erythema (NME) 5/6 (83%), diabetes mellitus 4/6 (66%) and diarrhoea, weakness and thrombosis 2/6 (33%). Plasma glucagon was elevated in all patients upon diagnosis (range 200-10 000 pm; N < 50). Skin biopsy was diagnostic only in 1/6 specimens obtained, even after revision. Metastatic disease developed in all patients; 4/6 initially presented with hepatic metastasis. All patient symptoms responded to somatostatin analogue therapy. In 4/6, the NME responded to amino acid solutions. Other modes of therapy were as follows: surgery in 3/6 patients, peptide receptor radioligand therapy with 90Y-DOTATOC (PRRT) in 3/6 patients (two responses) and chemotherapy in three patients (two responded). Four out of six patients died of the disease, and median survival time was 6 center dot 25 years (range 2-11) from diagnosis and 8 years (range 8-16) from initial symptoms. Five-year survival was 66%. Conclusion Our data indicate that somatostatin analogues and an aggressive surgical approach offer symptom relief and tumour control. Among other available treatment modalities, PRRT seems to hold the most promise.

Binding of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]A-778317 to native transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) channels in rat dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						TRPV1; Ligand-gated ion channel; Dorsal root ganglia; Spinal cord; Vanilloid; Resiniferatoxin	CAPSAICIN RECEPTOR; SPLICE VARIANT; VR1; ACTIVATION; ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION; HEAT; OLEOYLETHANOLAMIDE; RESINIFERATOXIN; COLOCALIZATION	A-778317 (1-((R)-5-tert-butyl-indan-1-yl)-3-isoquinolin-5-yl-urea) is a potent antagonist of human and rat transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) receptors. We have previously reported that [H-3]A-778317 is an excellent radioligand to study the recombinant human TRPV1 receptor in a heterologous expression system. These studies were extended to determine the feasibility of using [H-3]A-778317 to label native TRPV1 channels in rat tissues. Saturable high-affinity binding of [H-3]A-778317 was detected in membrane preparations of rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and spinal cord that was inhibited by TRPV1 receptor agonists and antagonists. [H-3]A-778317 labeled a single class of high-affinity binding sites in both rat DRG and spinal cord membranes (K-D=10 and 8.4 nM, respectively). The number of binding sites was 10-fold higher in rat DRG membranes than spinal cord membranes (B-max=3.3 and 0.35 pmol/mg protein, respectively). The pharmacology of the high-affinity binding sites was similar in rat DRG and spinal cord, but differed from the recombinant rat TRPV1 (rTRPV1) receptor expressed in transiently transfected HEK293-F cells. In particular, a large disparity in potency (>300-fold) was observed for the TRPV1 receptor agonist resiniferatoxin between native and recombinant rTRPV1 receptors. Our data indicate that the binding of [H-3]A-778317 to native rTRPV1 channels is pharmacologically distinct, and perhaps more complex, than its binding to the recombinant rTRPV1 receptor.

Methods: Three peptide-HYNIC conjugates containing the -AYGWMDF-NH2 C-terminal sequence and combinations of histidine, glutamic acid, and glycine were synthesized, radiolabeled with Tc-99m/Tc-99 using either tricine or ethylenediaminediacetic acid as a coligand, and analyzed by the high-performance liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometric techniques. Stability, receptor binding, and internalization and in vivo targeting in AR42J-bearing mice were assessed. Results: When radiolabeling was performed using tricine as a coligand, the insertion of a histidine residue near the HYNIC residue resulted in the displacement of one molecule of tricine from the coordination sphere, a reduction in the number of radiolabeled species formed, an improvement in the in vitro stability, an increase in the rate of radiopeptide internalization, and a significant improvement in tumor uptake in vivo. When radiolabeling was performed using ethylenediaminediacetic acid as a coligand, no effect on coligand binding, homogeneity, or in vitro stability was observed but a significant improvement in the internalization in vitro and tumor uptake in vivo was again found. All of the complexes formed showed similar receptor affinity in competitive radioligand binding assays. Conclusion: The insertion of histidine into the sequence of peptide-HYNIC conjugates can result in more stable, more homogeneous complexes that show improvements in tumor-targeting performance both in vitro and in vivo.

AM1241 is an indole derivative that exhibits high affinity and selectivity for the CB2 binding site and broad spectrum analgesic activity in rodent models, but is not an antagonist of CB2 in vitro functional assays. Additionally, its analgesic effects are mu-opioid receptor-dependent. Herein, we describe the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties of A-796260, a novel CB2 agonist. Experimental approach: A-796260 was characterized in radioligand binding and in vitro functional assays at rat and human CB1 and CB2 receptors. The behavioural profile of A-796260 was assessed in models of inflammatory, post-operative, neuropathic, and osteoarthritic (OA) pain, as well as its effects on motor activity. The receptor specificity was confirmed using selective CB1, CB2 and mu-opioid receptor antagonists. Key results: A-796260 exhibited high affinity and agonist efficacy at human and rat CB2 receptors, and was selective for the CB2 vs CB1 subtype. Efficacy in models of inflammatory, post-operative, neuropathic and OA pain was demonstrated, and these activities were selectively blocked by CB2, but not CB1 or m-opioid receptor-selective antagonists. Efficacy was achieved at doses that had no significant effects on motor activity. Conclusions and implications: These results further confirm the therapeutic potential of CB2 receptor-selective agonists for the treatment of pain. In addition, they demonstrate that A-796260 may be a useful new pharmacological compound for further studying CB2 receptor pharmacology and for evaluating its role in the modulation of pain.	[Yao, B.

Quantitative [<SUP>123</SUP>I]FP-CIT pinhole SPECT imaging predicts striatal dopamine levels, but not number of nigral neurons in different mouse models of Parkinson's disease	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						dopamine transporter; FP-CIT; pinhole SPECT; MPTP; 6-OHDA; Parkinson's disease	PHOTON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TRANSPORTER FUNCTION; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; MPTP; RATS; RECONSTRUCTION; PROGRESSION; EXPRESSION; PET	Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using [I-123]FP-CIT as radioligand for the dopamine transporter has become a widely used tool to monitor the integrity of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic projection in Parkinson's disease (PD). Previous studies with pinhole SPECT in small animals have demonstrated that the striatal [I-123]FP-CIT binding indeed correlates with the striatal dopamine transporter protein level. It is unclear, however, if there is a stable relationship between the striatal [I-123]FP-CIT binding and other functionally important parameters of the nigrostriatal system, such as the striatal dopamine levels and the number of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. To assess this question experimentally, we studied two different mouse models of PD, namely a mild 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine intoxication paradigm, to model mild nigrostriatal damage and the intrastflatal 6-hydroxydopamine paradigm to model more advanced nigrostriatal damage. Our data demonstrate that the striatal [I-123]FP-CIT binding measured by SPECT in vivo precisely predicts the striatal dopamine concentrations, but does not necessarily correlate with the nigral dopaminergic cell number. Thus, the present work underscores that FP-CIT SPECT does only allow judging the integrity of the striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals, but not the nigral dopaminergic cells in PD. This finding may have significant impact on the use of [I-123]FP-CIT SPECT as a surrogate marker for clinical trials aimed at measuring neuroprotection. (c) 2007 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Positron emission tomography displacement sensitivity: predicting binding potential change for positron emission tomography tracers based on their kinetic characteristics	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						affinity constant; amphetamine; compartmental model; competitive binding; dopamine receptor; neurotransmitter	DOPAMINE-RECEPTOR BINDING; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; PET; AMPHETAMINE; TRANSPORTER; RELEASE; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND	There is great interest in positron emission tomography ( PET) as a noninvasive assay of fluctuations in synaptic neurotransmitter levels, but questions remain regarding the optimal choice of tracer for such a task. A mathematical method is proposed for predicting the utility of any PET tracer as a detector of changes in the concentration of an endogenous competitor via displacement of the tracer ( a. k. a., its ` vulnerability' to competition). The method is based on earlier theoretical work by Endres and Carson and by the authors. A tracer- specific predictor, the PET Displacement Sensitivity ( PDS), is calculated from compartmental model simulations of the uptake and retention of dopaminergic radiotracers in the presence of transient elevations of dopamine ( DA). The PDS predicts the change in binding potential ( DBP) for a given change in receptor occupancy because of binding by the endogenous competitor. Simulations were performed using estimates of tracer kinetic parameters derived from the literature. For D-2/D-3 tracers, the calculated PDS indices suggest a rank order for sensitivity to displacement by DA as follows: raclopride ( highest sensitivity), followed by fallypride, FESP, FLB, NMSP, and epidepride ( lowest). Although the PDS takes into account the affinity constant for the tracer at the binding site, its predictive value cannot be matched by either a single equilibrium constant, or by any one rate constant of the model. Values for DBP have been derived from published studies that employed comparable displacement paradigms with amphetamine and a D-2/D-3 tracer. The values are in good agreement with the PDS- predicted rank order of sensitivity to displacement.

Cell-surface actin binds plasminogen and modulates neurotransmitter release from catecholaminergic cells	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						chromaffin cell; plasminogen; release; actin; nicotinic; catecholamine	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; ACTIVATOR T-PA; CHROMOGRANIN-A; SYMPATHETIC AXONS; REGULATED PATHWAY; NEURONAL DEATH; LATE-PHASE; TISSUE; SECRETION; PROTEINS	An emerging area of research has documented a novel role for the plasminogen activation system in the regulation of neurotransmitter release. Prohormones, secreted by cells within the sympathoadrenal system, are processed by plasmin to bioactive peptides that feed back to inhibit secretagogue-stimulated release. Catecholaminergic cells of the sympathoadrenal system are prototypic prohormone-secreting cells. Processing of prohormones by plasmin is enhanced in the presence of catecholaminergic cells, and the enhancement requires binding of plasmin(ogen) to cellular receptors. Consequently, modulation of the local cellular fibrinolytic system of catecholaminergic cells results in substantial changes in catecholamine release. However, mechanisms for enhancing prohormone processing and cell-surface molecules mediating the enhancement on catecholaminergic cells have not been investigated. Here we show that plasminogen activation was enhanced > 6.5-fold on catecholaminergic cells. Carboxypeptidase B treatment decreased cell-dependent plasminogen activation by similar to 90%, suggesting that the binding of plasminogen to proteins exposing C-terminal lysines on the cell surface is required to promote plasminogen activation. We identified catecholaminergic plasminogen receptors required for enhancing plasminogen activation, using a novel strategy combining targeted specific proteolysis using carboxypeptidase B with a proteomics approach using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, radioligand blotting, and tandem mass spectrometry. Two major plasminogen-binding proteins that exposed C-terminal lysines on the cell surface contained amino acid sequences corresponding to beta/gamma-actin. An anti-actin monoclonal antibody inhibited cell-dependent plasminogen activation and also enhanced nicotine-dependent catecholamine release. Our results suggest that cell-surface-expressed forms of actin bind plasminogen, thereby promoting plasminogen activation and increased prohormone processing leading to inhibition of neurotransmitter release.

Materials and Methods: The characteristics of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the ventral and dorsolateral prostate, and bladder base and dome of 3 and 22-month-old rats were determined using an isolated muscle bath, radioligand receptor binding and real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction techniques. Results: Old rats had significantly higher body weight, lower testosterone, a smaller ventral prostate and a larger bladder dome than young rats. Although there was no significant age dependent difference in the properties of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the bladder base and dome, total alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density, mRNA expression of all 3 alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha(1A) alpha(1B) and alpha(1D)) and the maximum contractile responses to phenylephrine were significantly lower in the ventral and dorsolateral prostate of 22 vs 3-month-old rats. Conclusions: Age related differences in the molecular, biochemical and functional properties of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in the rat genitourinary tract may indicate potential differences in the response to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists with aging, ie a decrease in the therapeutic response in old vs young rats in the response to alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists when used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia.

Pharmacological characterisation of strychnine and brucine analogues at glycine and α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						strychnine; brucine; glycine receptor; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-alpha 7	POSITIVE COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; BINDING; MODULATION; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONIST	Strychnine and brucine from the plant Strychnos nux vomica have been shown to have interesting pharmacological effects on several neurotransmitter receptors, including some members of the superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels. In this study, we have characterised the pharmacological properties of tertiary and quaternary analogues as well as bisquaternary dimers of strychnine and brucine at human alpha 1 and alpha 1 glycine receptors and at a chimera consisting of the amino-terminal domain of the 0 nicotinic receptor (containing the orthosteric ligand binding site) and the ion channel domain of the 5-HT3A serotonin receptor. Although the majority of the analogues displayed significantly increased K-i values at the glycine receptors compared to strychnine and brucine, a few retained the high antagonist potencies of the parent compounds. However, mirroring the pharmacological profiles of strychnine and brucine, none of the analogues displayed significant selectivity between the alpha 1 and alpha 1 beta subtypes. The structure-activity relationships for the compounds at the alpha 7/5-HT3 chimera were significantly different from those at the glycine receptors. Most strikingly, quaternization of strychnine and brucine with substituents possessing different steric and electronic properties completely eliminated the activity at the glycine receptors, whereas binding affinity to the alpha 7/5-HT3 chimera was retained for the majority of the quaternary analogues. This study provides an insight into the structure-activity relationships for strychnine and brucine analogues at these ligand-gated ion channels. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The corresponding rhenium complex (PPPE-MAMA'-ReO)(Re-2) has been prepared and characterized. In vitro competition binding assays show moderate affinity of Re-2 towards sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors with K-i values of 8.67 +/- 0.07 and 5.71 +/- 1.88 mu mol, respectively. Planar images obtained at 0.5 h, 4 h, 20 h after i.v. injection indicate the accumulation of [Tc-99m]-2 in MCF-7 human breast tumor bearing mice at 20 h. Furthermore, the accumulation of [Tc-99m]-2 has been inhibited at 20 h after co-injection of [Tc-99m]-2 plus haloperidol (1 mg/kg). Biodistribution studies of [Tc-99m]-2 display an in vivo tumor uptake of 0.14% +/- 0.01% ID/g at 24 h post i.v. injection with a tumor/muscle ratio of 6.02 +/- 0.87. The above results suggest that [Tc-99m]-2, derived from a previously published lead compound, retains certain tumor uptake and affinity for sigma receptors. [Tc-99m]-2 may be used as a basis for further structural modifications to develop tumor imaging agents with high affinity for a receptors.

The association between FBP and seminal components as well as the cellular source of FBP was analysed. Immunoblotting of human seminal plasma, with and without prostasomes, prostasomal fractions and spermatozoa with antibodies against human FBP revealed a single distinct band similar to that observed with purified human FBP. Flow cytometry identified FBP on the surface of ejaculated spermatozoa. Immunohistochemistry showed positive immunostaining of epididymal epithelium, vas deferens and ejaculated spermatozoa, whereas the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, testicular spermatozoa and seminiferous tubules of testis stained negatively. Electron microscopy immunocytochemistry with antibodies against rat FBP showed labelling located to luminal microvilli and intracellular vesicles of rat epididymal epithelial cells and the surface of spermatozoa in the epididymal duct. High-affinity binding of picomolar amounts of tritiated folate to fractions of human prostasomes or prostasome-like vesicles was completely depressed by excess amounts of unlabelled folate. The study indicates that FBP is secreted from the epithelia of epididymis and vas deferens, and that a small fraction of FBP is associated with prostasome-like vesicles which adhere to spermatozoa in the epididymal duct. FBP could have a bacteriostatic function by depriving folate-requiring bacteria of folate and/or ascertain a normal DNA replication subsequent to fertilization by vectorial transfer of folate to the inner compartment of the spermatozoa.

Voltage-dependence was also lost on going from A to its N-ethyl analogue. 5 These studies suggest that C derivatives may be useful tools for studies characterising the antagonist and ion channel sites on human alpha 7, alpha 4 beta 2 or alpha 4 beta 4 nACh receptors and for revealing structure-function relationships for nACh receptor antagonists.

Chronic alcohol intake is associated with down-regulation of central dopamine D-2 receptors, and delayed recovery of D-2 receptor sensitivity after detoxification is positively correlated with high risk for relapse. Prolonged D-2 receptor dysfunction in the ventral striatum may interfere with a dopamine-dependent error detection signal and bias the brain reward system toward excessive attribution of incentive salience to alcohol-associated stimuli. Method: Multimodal imaging, with the radioligand [F-18]desmethoxyfallypride and positron emission tomography as well as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), was used to compare 11 detoxified, male alcoholics with 13 healthy men. The authors measured the association of D-2-like dopamine receptors in the ventral striatum with alcohol craving and central processing of alcohol cues. Results: Activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum by alcohol-associated stimuli, relative to activation by neutral visual stimuli, was greater in the detoxified alcoholics than in the healthy men. The alcoholics displayed less availability of D-2-like receptors in the ventral striatum, which was associated with alcohol craving severity and with greater cue-induced activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate as assessed with fMRI. Discussion: In alcoholics, dopaminergic dysfunction in the ventral striatum may attribute incentive salience to alcohol-associated stimuli, so that alcohol cues elicit craving and excessive activation of neural networks associated with attention and behavior control.

However, the relative abundance of hetero-versus homodimers and the specific properties, which can be attributed to each form, are difficult to determine. Using a bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) donor saturation assay, we show that half-maximal MT1/MT2 heterodimer formation is reached for expression levels as low as similar to4000 receptors per cell. The relative propensity of MT1 homodimer and MT1/MT2 heterodimer formation are similar, whereas that for the MT2 homodimer formation is 3- to 4-fold lower. These data indicate that both the relative expression level of each receptor isoform and the affinities between monomers may determine the actual proportion of homo- and heterodimers. The specific interaction of ligands with the MT1/MT2 heterodimer was studied using a BRET-based assay as a readout for the conformational changes of the heterodimer. An MT1/MT2 heterodimer-specific profile and ligands selective for the MT1/MT2 heterodimer compared with the MT2 homodimer could be identified. Classic radioligand binding and BRET studies suggest that heterodimers contain two functional ligand binding sites that maintain their respective selectivity for MT1 and MT2 ligands. Occupation of either binding site is sufficient to induce a conformational change within the heterodimer. Taken together, these results show that the probability of GPCR heterodimer formation may be equal to or even higher than that of the corresponding homodimers and that specific properties of heterodimers can be revealed using a BRET-based ligand/receptor interaction assay.

This function may be regulated by angiotensin II (Ang II) through activation of cell-surface receptors. Although studies suggest that podocytes express receptors for Ang II, the Ang II binding site has not been characterized with radioligand binding techniques. We therefore used iodine 125-labeled Ang II to monitor Ang II-receptor density during differentiation of a mouse podocyte cell line. Scatchard analyses of equilibrium binding data revealed a single class of high-affinity binding sites (dissociation constant similar to3 nmol/L) in both differentiated and nondifferentiated cells. During differentiation, the density of Ang II-receptor sites increased roughly 15-fold in differentiated podocytes (maximal density of specific binding sites 881 fmol/mg protein) compared with that in nondifferentiated cells (52 fmol/mg protein; P < .005). Glomerular podocytes expressed messenger RNA for AT1A, AT1B, and AT2 receptor subtypes, and competitive binding studies found that differentiated podocytes expressed mostly AT1 receptors (similar to75%) with lesser amounts of AT2 (similar to25%). Up-regulation of Ang II-receptor number was associated with increased Ang II-receptor responsiveness, as evidenced by enhanced Ang II-stimulated inositol phosphate (IP) generation and incorporation of tritiated thymidine. Both (H-3)thymidine incorporation and IP generation were mediated by AT1-receptor activation. These data suggest that glomerular podocytes express a high-affinity binding site for Ang H with pharmacologic characteristics of both AT1 and AT2 receptors. This receptor site is up-regulated during podocyte differentiation, and receptor activation induces both IP generation and DNA synthesis by AT1-dependent mechanisms. We speculate that activation of podocyte Ang II receptors contributes to glomerular damage in disease states.

The hypothesis addressed was that glutamate receptors (GluRs) in cerebral microvascular endothelium are functionally linked to HO. Using a radioligand binding and immunoblotting, GluRs were characterized in cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMVEC) from newborn pigs. High-affinity (80 nmol/L) reversible binding of [H-3]glutamate ([H-3]Glu) was detected in CMVEC membranes. The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor ligands-NMDA, quinolinic acid, (+/-)1-aminocyclopentane-cis-1,3-dicarboxylic acid (cis-ACPD), AP5, 4C3HPG, and CPP-and the (RS)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)/kainate receptor ligands-AMPA, kainic acid, quisqualic acid, DNQX, and CNQX-displaced 20% to 30% of bound [H-3]Glu in CMVEC membranes. Metabotropic GluRs antagonists (4CPG, PHCC, and CPPG) did not displace bound [H-3]Glu. L-Aspartate, an agonist of GluRs and glutamate transporters, displaced 80% or more of bound [H-3]Glu. Ionotropic (NR1 and GluR1) and metabotropic (mGluR1alpha) GluRs were detected in CMVEC by immunoblotting, Glutamate, aspartate, cis-ACPD, AMPA, (RS)-2-amino-(3-hydroxy-5-tert-butylisoxazol-4-yl)propanoic acid (ATPA), and kainate (10(-5) mol/L) increased HO-directed CO formation by isolated cerebral microvessels and by cultured CMVEC. These data in newborn pigs suggest that CMVEC express ionotropic GluRs that are functionally linked to HO. GluR-mediated increases in CO formation by vascular endothelium may result in increase in cerebral blood flow.

These radiotracers are close analogues of reboxetine, a potent and selective ligand for the norepinephrine transporter (NET). They were examined as potential ligands for imaging NET in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). The in vivo brain distribution of both [C-11]-labeled enantiomers were evaluated in rats. Following tail-vein injection of the (R,R)-enantiomer regional brain uptake and washout of radioactivity was homogeneous at all time points examined (5-60 min). In contrast, administration of the (S,S)-enantiomer produced a heterogeneous distribution of radioactivity in brain with highest uptake in the hypothalamus, a NET rich region, and lowest uptake in the striatum, a brain region devoid of NET. Hypothalamus to striatum ratios of 2.5 to one were achieved at 60 min post injection of (S,S)-[(11)]-MeNER. Pre-injection of the norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, reboxetine or desipramine, reduced hypothalamus to striatum ratios to near unity while reuptake inhibitors of dopamine and serotonin had no significant effect on binding. In vitro autoradiography studies (rat brain slices) with (S,S)-[C-11]-MeNER produced a regional distribution pattern that was consistent with the reported distribution of NET. (S,S)-[C-11]-MeNER has the potential to be the first successful PET ligand to image NET. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The alpha5-containing subtype is highly expressed in the hippocampus, and selective alpha5 inverse agonists (which decrease tonic GABA inhibition) are being developed as potential memory-enhancing agents. Evidence for such receptor localization and specialization in humans in vivo is lacking because the widely used probes for imaging the GABA-benzodiazepine receptors, [C-11]flumazenil and [I-123]iomazenil, appear to reflect binding to the alpha1 subtype, based on its distribution and affinity of flumazenil for this subtype. The authors characterized for positron emission tomography (PET) a radioligand from Ro15 4513, the binding of which has a marked limbic distribution in the rat and human brain in vivo. Competition studies in vivo in the rat revealed that radiolabeled Ro15 4513 uptake was reduced to nonspecific levels only by drugs that have affinity for the alpha5 Subtype (flunitrazepam, RYSO, Ro15 45 13, L655,708), but not by the a I selective agonist, zolpidem. Quantification of [C-11]Ro15 4513 PET was performed in humans using a metabolite-corrected plasma input function. [C-11]Ro15 4513 uptake was relatively greater in limbic areas compared with [C-11]flumazenil, but lower in the occipital cortex and cerebellum. The authors conclude that [C-11]Ro15 4513 PET labels in vivo the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor containing the alpha5 subtype in limbic structures and can be used to further explore the functional role of this subtype in humans.

Ecgonine HCl (5) was obtained from (-)-cocaine (1) by hydrolysis using I N HCl. Acid catalysed esterification of 5 using 2-propanol and HCl gas afforded 2beta-isopropyl ecgonine (6). Compounds 7-9 were obtained via esterification of the 3beta-hydroxyl group of 6 using the appropriate acid chloride. Compound 10 was obtained via selective hydrolysis and re-esterification of 7 using 2-propanol and HCl gas. Compound I I was obtained by reduction of 9 using H-2/Pd-C. Compounds 7, 10 and I I showed high binding affinity to the DAT (as indicated from the inhibition of the binding of [H-3]WIN 35,428 (3)) with IC50 values (mean +/- S.E.M.) 208.5 +/- 9.5, 47.43 +/- 1.79 and 11.25 +/- 3.37 nM, respectively). Compound 7 is comparatively as active as cocaine, 10 is ca. fivefold more active than cocaine and 11 is ca. 20-fold more active than cocaine and even twice more active than the radioligand 3. Compound It, like its methyl ester analog (2' aminococaine), exhibited the highest affinity to the DAT. These results, along with previous results, emphasise the importance of a hydrogen-bond donor group at the T-position of cocaine and its isopropyl ester analogs to enhance binding affinity to the DAT.

To investigate the role of the alpha(2A)-AR in the modulation of mouse primary behavioral characteristics and brain neurochemistry, mice with targeted inactivation of the gene for the alpha(2A)-AR were compared with wild-type C57BL/6 control animals. First, a comprehensive behavioral screen was employed to provide a detailed characterization of basic neurologic functions. Thereafter, the mice were analyzed in three models of anxiety, i.e. the elevated-plus maze test, the marble burying test and the open field test. The diurnal activity pattern of the mice was assessed in a 24-h locomotor activity test. Furthermore, receptor autoradiography of the brain was performed using the subtype-non-selective alpha(2)-AR antagonist radioligand [H-3]RS-79948-197. Lack of the alpha(2A)-AR was associated with alterations in autonomic functions, including increased heart rate and piloerection. The mutant mice also exhibited impaired motor coordination skills, increased anxiety-like behavior and an abnormal diurnal activity pattern. In addition, neurochemical analysis of monoamine neurotransmitters revealed a considerable increase in brain norepinephrine turnover in mice lacking alpha(2A)-AR. Our results provide further support for the crucial role of the alpha(2A)-AR in modulating brain noradrenergic neuro-transmission and many aspects of mouse behavior and physiology. (C) 2002 IBRO.

The pathogenesis seems to be associated with autonomic dysfunction. Here, we consider the muscarinic cholinoceptor mediated alteration in distal colon function in chagasic megacolon. Patients-Patients were divided into four groups: group I, chronic chagasic patients with megacolon; group II, chronic chagasic patients without megacolon; group III, nonchagasic patients with megacolon; and group IV, normal healthy volunteers (control). Methods-Binding assay and immunoblot of cholinoceptors from human and rat colon and enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) using a synthetic 24mer peptide corresponding to the second extracellular loop of human M-2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) were used to detect the presence of serum antibodies. The effect of antibodies on basal tone and 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production of human and rat distal colon strips were also tested. Results-Group I but not the other groups had circulating antibodies capable of interacting with human colon activating M-2 mAChR, as they competed with binding of specific radioligand to mAChR and interacted with the second extracellular loop of human M-2 mAChR. Moreover, affinity purified anti-M-2 peptide IgG from group I, in common with monoclonal antihuman M, mAChR, recognised bands with a molecular weight corresponding to colon mAChR. This antibody also displayed an agonist-like activity, increasing basal tone and decreasing cAMP accumulation. Both effects were blunted by AF-DX 116 and neutralised by the synthetic peptide. Conclusions-In chagasic patients with megacolon there are antibodies that can recognise and activate M-2 mAChR. The implications of these autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of chagasic megacolon is discussed.

The beta- and beta(1)-adrenoceptor densities and subtype distribution, and beta-adrenoceptor-G protein coupling were studied by radioligand binding, and levels of G(s alpha), G(i alpha), and G(q/11 alpha), protein species were determined by Western blotting in SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) control rats aged 3.5 weeks, 3 months, and 8 months. In 3.5-week-old SHRs, both the beta-adrenoceptor density and the percentage of agonist high-affinity binding sites were higher than in age-matched WKY rats. The beta(1)/beta(2)-subtype distribution, the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density, and the alpha(1B)/alpha(1A-)subtype distribution were similar in rats of both strains at all ages. Although essentially no differences in G(s alpha) levels between SHRs and WKY rats were detected, higher G(i alpha) and lower G(q/11 alpha) concentrations were found in 3.5-week-old SHRs. In 3-month-old SHRs, increased levels of G(q/11 alpha) proteins were observed. In 8-month-old SHRs, none of the parameters was different from those of controls. We conclude that the differences in properties of the adrenergic signal transduction system between SHRs and WKY rats are exclusively observable before and at the onset of the overt hypertension. Moreover, the hypertensive genotype apparently affects G proteins more readily than adrenoceptors.

A(2A) receptor activation in the striatum or pallidum decreases D-2 signaling. In contrast, A(2A) receptor antagonism may help potentiate it. Furthermore, previous PET studies have shown increased A(2A) receptor availability in striatum of late-stage PD patients with dyskinesia. However, human in vivo evidence for striatal A(2A) receptor availability in early-stage PD is limited. This study aimed to investigate possible differences in A(2A) receptor availability in the striatum and pallidum of early- and moderate-stage PD patients without dyskinesias. Methods Brain MRI and PET with [C-11]TMSX radioligand, targeting A(2A) receptors, was performed in 9 patients with early- and 9 with moderate-stage PD without dyskinesia and in 6 healthy controls. Distribution volume ratios (DVR) were calculated to assess specific [C-11]TMSX binding in caudate, putamen and pallidum. Results A(2A) receptor availability (DVR) was decreased in the bilateral caudate of early-stage PD patients when compared with healthy controls (P = 0.02). Conversely, DVR was increased bilaterally in the pallidum of moderate-stage PD patients compared to healthy controls (P = 0.03). Increased mean striatal DVR correlated with higher motor symptom severity (rho\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$rho$$\end{document} = 0.47, P = 0.02).

A beta and tau pathology appear to spread along pathways of highly connected brain regions, but it remains elusive whether microglial activation follows a similar distribution pattern. Here, we assess whether connectivity is associated with microglia activation patterns. Methods We included 32 A beta-positive early AD subjects (18 women, 14 men) and 18 A beta-negative age-matched healthy controls (10 women, 8 men) from the prospective ActiGliA (Activity of Cerebral Networks, Amyloid and Microglia in Aging and Alzheimer's Disease) study. All participants underwent microglial activation positron emission tomography (PET) with the third-generation mitochondrial 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligand [F-18]GE-180 and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure resting-state functional and structural connectivity. Results We found that inter-regional covariance in TSPO-PET and standardized uptake value ratio was preferentially distributed along functionally highly connected brain regions, with MRI structural connectivity showing a weaker association with microglial activation. AD patients showed increased TSPO-PET tracer uptake bilaterally in the anterior medial temporal lobe compared to controls, and higher TSPO-PET uptake was associated with cognitive impairment and dementia severity in a disease stage-dependent manner. Interpretation Microglial activation distributes preferentially along highly connected brain regions, similar to tau pathology. These findings support the important role of microglia in neurodegeneration, and we speculate that pathology spreads throughout the brain along vulnerable connectivity pathways.

ImmunoPET of Ovarian and Pancreatic Cancer with AR9.6, a Novel MUC16-Targeted Therapeutic Antibody	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; MUC16; ANTIGEN; PET; IMMUNOTHERAPY; MAB-B43.13; CELL	Purpose: Advances in our understanding of the contribution of aberrant glycosylation to the pro-oncogenic signaling and metastasis of tumor cells have reinvigorated the development of mucin-targeted therapies. Here, we validate the tumor-targeting ability of a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb), AR9.6, that binds MUC16 and abrogates downstream oncogenic signaling to confer a therapeutic response. Experimental Design: The in vitro and ex vivo validation of the binding of AR9.6 to MUC16 was achieved via flow cytometry, radioligand binding assay (RBA), and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The in vivo MUC16 targeting of AR9.6 was validated by creating a Zr-89-labeled radioimmunoconjugate of the mAb and utilizing immunoPET and ex vivo biodistribution studies in xenograft models of human ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Results: Flow cytometry, RBA, and IHC revealed that AR9.6 binds to ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells in an MUC16-dependent manner. The in vivo radiopharmacologic profile of Zr-89-labeled AR9.6 in mice bearing ovarian and pancreatic cancer xenografts confirmed the MUC16-dependent tumor targeting by the radioimmunoconjugate. Radioactivity uptake was also observed in the distant lymph nodes (LNs) of mice bearing xenografts with high levels of MUC16 expression (i.e., OVCAR3 and Capan-2). IHC analyses of these PET-positive LNs highlighted the presence of shed antigen as well as necrotic, phagocytized, and actively infiltrating neoplastic cells. The humanization of AR9.6 did not compromise its ability to target MUC16-expressing tumors. Conclusions: The unique therapeutic mechanism of AR9.6 combined with its excellent in vivo tumor targeting makes it a highly promising theranostic agent. huAR9.6 is poised for clinical translation to impact the management of metastatic ovarian and pancreatic cancers.

Use of 55 PET radiotracers under approval of a Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC)	EJNMMI RADIOPHARMACY AND CHEMISTRY			English	Article						PET imaging; Regulatory oversight; Dosimetry; RDRC; IND; Radiopharmaceuticals; Quality assurance	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; WHOLE-BODY BIODISTRIBUTION; HUMAN RADIATION-DOSIMETRY; ONE-POT SYNTHESIS; HUMAN BRAIN; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; C-11 TETRABENAZINE; RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; NERVE-TERMINALS	BackgroundIn the US, EU and elsewhere, basic clinical research studies with positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers that are generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) can often be conducted under institutional approval. For example, in the United States, such research is conducted under the oversight of a Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) as long as certain requirements are met. Firstly, the research must be for basic science and cannot be intended for immediate therapeutic or diagnostic purposes, or to determine the safety and effectiveness of the PET radiotracer. Secondly, the PET radiotracer must be generally recognized as safe and effective. Specifically, the mass dose to be administered must not cause any clinically detectable pharmacological effect in humans, and the radiation dose to be administered must be the smallest dose practical to perform the study and not exceed regulatory dose limits within a 1-year period. In our experience, the main barrier to using a PET radiotracer under RDRC approval is accessing the required information about mass and radioactive dosing.ResultsThe University of Michigan (UM) has a long history of using PET radiotracers in clinical research studies. Herein we provide dosing information for 55 radiotracers that will enable other PET Centers to use them under the approval of their own RDRC committees.ConclusionsThe data provided herein will streamline future RDRC approval, and facilitate further basic science investigation of 55 PET radiotracers that target functionally relevant biomarkers in high impact disease states.

In order to discriminate between individual signaling pathways, the determination of beta-arrestin2 recruitment, in addition to G-protein activation, is of great value. In this study, we established a sensitive split luciferase-based assay with the ability to quantify beta-arrestin2 recruitment to D-2long and D(3)receptors and measure time-resolved beta-arrestin2 recruitment to the D-2long receptor after agonist stimulation. We were able to characterize several standard (inverse) agonists as well as antagonists at the D2longR and D3R subtypes, whereas for the D4.4R, no beta-arrestin2 recruitment was detected, confirming previous reports. Extensive radioligand binding studies and comparisons with the respective wild-type receptors confirm that the attachment of the Emerald luciferase fragment to the receptors does not affect the integrity of the receptor proteins. Studies on the involvement of GRK2/3 and PKC on the beta-arrestin recruitment to the D-2long R and D3R, as well as at the D1R using different kinase inhibitors, showed that the assay could also contribute to the elucidation of signaling mechanisms. Its broad applicability, which provides concentration-dependent and kinetic information on receptor/beta-arrestin2 interactions, renders this homogeneous assay a valuable method for the identification of biased agonists.

Serotonin release measured in the human brain: a PET study with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]CIMBI-36 and d-amphetamine challenge	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ENDOGENOUS OPIOID RELEASE; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; 5-HT2A RECEPTOR; NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE; BINDING; SYSTEM; TRANSMISSION; SENSITIVITY; FLUOXETINE	Positron emission tomography (PET) enables non-invasive estimation of neurotransmitter fluctuations in the living human brain. While these methods have been applied to dopamine and some other transmitters, estimation of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; Serotonin) release has proved to be challenging. Here we demonstrate the utility of the novel 5-HT2A receptor agonist radioligand, [C-11]CIMBI-36, and a d-amphetamine challenge to evaluate synaptic 5-HT changes in the living human brain. Seventeen healthy male volunteers received [C-11]CIMBI-36 PET scans before and 3 h after an oral dose of d-amphetamine (0.5 mg/kg). Dynamic PET data were acquired over 90 min, and the total volume of distribution (V-T) in the frontal cortex and the cerebellum derived from a kinetic analysis using MA1. The frontal cortex binding potential (BPNDfrontal) was calculated as (V-T(frontal)/V-T(cerebellum)) - 1. increment BPNDfrontal = 1 - (BPNDfrontal post-dose/BPNDfrontal baseline) was used as an index of 5-HT release. Statistical inference was tested by means of a paired Students t-test evaluating a reduction in post-amphetamine [C-11]CIMBI-36 BPNDfrontal. Following d-amphetamine administration, [C-11]CIMBI-36 BPNDfrontal was reduced by 14 +/- 13% (p = 0.002). Similar effects were observed in other cortical regions examined in an exploratory analysis. [C-11]CIMBI-36 binding is sensitive to synaptic serotonin release in the human brain, and when combined with a d-amphetamine challenge, the evaluation of the human brain serotonin system in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as major depression and Parkinson's disease is enabled.

Despite the use of multimodal treatments, most patients relapse, often due to the highly invasive nature of gliomas. However, the detection of glioma infiltration remains challenging. The aim of this study was to assess advanced PET and MRI techniques for visualizing biological activity and infiltration of the tumor. Methods Using multimodality imaging, we investigated [F-18]DPA-714, a radiotracer targeting the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), [F-18]FET PET, non-Gaussian diffusion MRI (apparent diffusion coefficient, kurtosis), and the S-index, a composite diffusion metric, to detect tumor infiltration in a human invasive glioma model. In vivo imaging findings were confirmed by autoradiography and immunofluorescence. Results Increased tumor-to-contralateral [F-18]DPA-714 uptake ratios (1.49 0.11) were found starting 7 weeks after glioma cell implantation. TSPO-PET allowed visualization of glioma infiltration into the contralateral hemisphere 2 weeks earlier compared with the clinically relevant biomarker for biological glioma activity [F-18]FET. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), in particular kurtosis, was more sensitive than standard T2-weighted MRI to detect differences between the glioma-bearing and the contralateral hemisphere at 5 weeks. Immunofluorescence data reflect in vivo findings. Interestingly, labeling for tumoral and stromal TSPO indicates a predominant expression of TSPO by tumor cells. Conclusion These results suggest that advanced PET and MRI methods, such as [F-18]DPA-714 and DWI, may be superior to standard imaging methods to visualize glioma growth and infiltration at an early stage.

Evaluation of SYA16263 as a new potential antipsychotic agent without catalepsy	PHARMACOLOGY BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Antipsychotic; D-2 receptor; beta-Arrestin pathway; Catalepsy; Aripiprazole; Apomorphine-induced climbing	5-HT1A RECEPTOR ACTIVATION; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; AGONIST PROPERTIES; TARDIVE-DYSKINESIA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WEIGHT-GAIN; DRUG ACTION; HALOPERIDOL; ARIPIPRAZOLE; FENFLURAMINE	SYA16263 exhibited moderate radioligand binding affinity at the Dy receptor and produced inhibition of apomorphine-inducedclimbing behavior in mice with an EDso value of 3.88 mg/kg IP, predicting potential antipsychotic effects in humans. Analysis of plasma and brains from rats injected IP with SYA16263 over the course of 24 h revealed a log [brain]/[plasma] (log BB) at Cmax observed equal to 1.08, indicating that SYA16263 enters the brain and is predicted to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) readily. When tested in animal behavior tests for catalepsy, SYA16263 did not produce catalepsy at doses up to 19 times the apomorphine ED50 value predicting little or no extra-pyramidal (EPS) side effects in humans. This is similar to aripiprazole, which is associated with a low incidence of EPS in humans, but unlike haloperidol which is known to cause severe EPS in humans. Functional activities for SYA16263 show that it acts as a D-2 agonist at both the Gi and beta-arrestin pathways, similar to, but better than aripiprazole, which could account for the absence of the catalepsy observed. Taken together, the receptor binding profile, the functional status, the animal behavioral tests and the log BB value, all provide evidence for further pre-clinical testing of SYA16263 as a potential antipsychotic agent with an interesting profile and a unique mechanism of action resulting in no EPS even up to 19 times the ED50 value.

Assessment and Management of Anti-Insulin Autoantibodies in Varying Presentations of Insulin Autoimmune Syndrome	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							C-PEPTIDE; HYPOGLYCEMIA; STANDARDIZATION; ANTIBODIES; RESISTANCE; QUANTIFICATION; PROINSULIN; DIAGNOSIS; AFFINITY; PATIENT	Context: Insulin autoimmune syndrome (IAS), spontaneous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia due to insulin-binding autoantibodies, may be difficult to distinguish from tumoral or other forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, including surreptitious insulin administration. No standardized treatment regimen exists. Objectives: To evaluate an analytic approach to IAS and responses to different treatments. Design and Setting: Observational study in the UK Severe Insulin Resistance Service. Patients: Six patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and detectable circulating anti-insulin antibody (IA). Main Outcome Measures: Glycemia, plasma insulin, and C-peptide concentrations by immunoassay or mass spectrometry (MS). Immunoreactive insulin was determined in the context of polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and gel filtration chromatography (GFC). IA quantification using ELISA and RIA, and IA were further characterized using radioligand binding studies. Results: All patients were diagnosed with IAS (five IgG, one IgA) based on a high insulin/C-peptide ratio, low insulin recovery after PEG precipitation, and GFC evidence of antibody-bound insulin. Neither ELISA nor RIA result proved diagnostic for every case. MS provided a more robust quantification of insulin in the context of IA. One patient was managed conservatively, four were treated with diazoxide without sustained benefit, and four were treated with immunosuppression with highly variable responses. IA affinity did not appear to influence presentation or prognosis. Conclusions: IAS should be considered in patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and a high insulin/C-peptide ratio. Low insulin recovery on PEG precipitation supports the presence of insulin-binding antibodies, with GFC providing definitive confirmation. Immunomodulatory therapy should be customized according to individual needs and clinical response.

While preclinical studies have proposed several pathways regarding potential interactions between oxidative stress and neuroimmune imbalance in the development of psychosis, the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction are not yet understood. To date, no study has investigated this link in vivo in the human brain. We conducted the first in vivo study linking translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) expression and glutathione (a major brain antioxidant and a marker for redox status) in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of a relatively large sample of participants (N = 48) including 27 antipsychotic-naive individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis and 21 matched healthy volunteers using high-resolution PET with TSPO radioligand, [F-18]FEPPA, and 3T proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1 MRS). The omnibus model (including TSPO genotype as covariate) was significant (F-(4,F- 43) = 10.01, p < 0.001), with a significant group interaction (t = -2.10, p = 0.04), suggesting a different relation between [F-18]FEPPA V-T and glutathione in each clinical group. In healthy volunteers, but not in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis, we found a significant negative association between glutathione levels and [F-18]FEPPA V-T (r = -0.60, p = 0.006). We observed no significant group differences with respect to [F-18]FEPPA VT or glutathione levels. These findings suggest an abnormal interaction between TSPO expression and redox status in the clinical high risk states for psychosis.

F-18-flortaucipir is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand sensitive to tau in AD, but its clinical utility will depend in part on its ability to predict cognitive symptoms in diverse dementia phenotypes associated with selective, regional uptake. We examined associations between 18F-flortaucipir and cognition in 14 mildly-impaired patients (12 with cerebrospinal fluid analytes consistent with AD pathology) who had amnestic (n = 5) and non-amnestic AD syndromes, including posterior cortical atrophy (PCA, n = 5) and logopenic-variant primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA, n = 4). Amnestic AD patients had deficits in memory; lvPPA in language; and both amnestic AD and PCA patients in visuospatial function. Associations with cognition were tested using sparse regression and compared to associations in anatomical regions-of-interest (ROIs). F-18-flortaucipir uptake was expected to show regionally-specific correlations with each domain. In multivariate analyses, uptake was elevated in neocortical areas specifically associated with amnestic and non-amnestic syndromes. Uptake in left anterior superior temporal gyrus accounted for 67% of the variance in language performance. Uptake in right lingual gyrus predicted 85% of the variance in visuospatial performance. Memory was predicted by uptake in right fusiform gyrus and cuneus as well as a cluster comprising right anterior hippocampus and amygdala; this eigenvector explained 57% of the variance in patients' scores. These results provide converging evidence for associations between F-18-flortaucipir uptake, tau pathology, and patients' cognitive symptoms.

Methods: Serial whole-body PET scans of 5 subjects with recently diagnosed thyroid cancer were acquired before surgery for up to 4 h after injection of 184 +/- 15 MBq of F-18-TFB. Activity was determined in whole blood, plasma, and urine. Mean organ-absorbed doses and effective doses were calculated via quantitative image analysis and using OLINDA/EXM software. Results: Images showed a high uptake of F-18-TFB in known areas of high hNIS expression (thyroid, salivary glands, and stomach). Excretion was predominantly renal. No adverse effects in relation to safety of the radiopharmaceutical were observed. The effective dose was 0.0326 +/- 0.0018 mSv/MBq. The critical tissues/organs receiving the highest mean sex-averaged absorbed doses were the thyroid (0.135 +/- 0.079 mSv/MBq), stomach (0.069 +/- 0.022 mSv/MBq), and salivary glands (parotids, 0.031 +/- 0.011 mSv/MBq; submandibular, 0.061 +/- 0.031 mSv/MBq). Other organs of interest were the bladder (0.102 +/- 0.046 mSv/MBq) and kidneys (0.029 +/- 0.009 mSv/MBq). Conclusion: Imaging using F-18-TFB imparts a radiation exposure similar in magnitude to many other F-18-labeled radiotracers. F-18-TFB shows a biodistribution similar to Tc-99m-pertechnetate, a known nonorganified hNIS tracer, and is pharmacologically and radiobiologically safe in humans. Phase 2 trials for F-18-TFB as an hNIS imaging agent are warranted.	[O'Doherty, Jim; Jauregui-Osoro, Maite; Szyszko, Teresa; Marsden, Paul K.; O'Doherty, Michael J.; Cook, Gary J.

To examine binding interactions at the nicotinic receptor, it has been co-crystallised with the structural homologue acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP; PDB ID 2BYQ), and with an AChBP chimaera (3SQ6) that shares 64% sequence identity with the alpha 7 nACh receptor. However, the binding orientations revealed by AChBP co-crystal structures may not precisely represent their receptor homologues and experimental evidence is needed to verify the ligand poses. Here we identify potential binding site interactions between epibatidine and AChBP residues, and substitute equivalent positions in the alpha 7 nACh receptor. The effects of these are probed by [H-3]epibatidine binding following the expression alpha 7 nACh receptor cysteine mutants in HEM 293 cells. Of the sixteen mutants created, the affinity of epibatidine was unaffected by the substitutions Q55C, L106C, L116C, T146C, D160C and S162C, reduced by C186A and C187A, increased by Q114C and S144C, and abolished by W53C, Y91C, N104C, W145C, Y184C and Y191C. These results are consistent with the predicted orientations in AChBP and suggest that epibatidine is likely to occupy a similar location at alpha 7 nACh receptors. We speculate that steric constraints placed upon the C-5 position of the pyridine ring in 3SQ6 may account for the relatively poor affinities of epibatidine derivatives that are substituted at this position.

Role of Conserved Disulfide Bridges and Aromatic Residues in Extracellular Loop 2 of Chemokine Receptor CCR8 for Chemokine and Small Molecule Binding	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; LIGAND-BINDING; T-CELLS; PROTEIN; ACTIVATION; IDENTIFICATION; RECOGNITION; MODULATION; INHIBITOR; SEQUENCE	Chemokine receptors play important roles in the immune system and are linked to several human diseases. The initial contact of chemokines with their receptors depends on highly specified extracellular receptor features. Here we investigate the importance of conserved extracellular disulfide bridges and aromatic residues in extracellular loop 2 (ECL-2) for ligand binding and activation in the chemokine receptor CCR8. We used inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation and radioligand binding experiments to determine the impact of receptor mutagenesis on both chemokine and small molecule agonist and antagonist binding and action in CCR8. We find that the seven-transmembrane (TM) receptor conserved disulfide bridge (7TM bridge) linking transmembrane helix III (TMIII) and ECL-2 is crucial for chemokine and small molecule action, whereas the chemokine receptor conserved disulfide bridge between the N terminus and TMVII is needed only for chemokines. Furthermore, we find that two distinct aromatic residues in ECL-2, Tyr(184) (Cys + 1) and Tyr(187) (Cys + 4), are crucial for binding of the CC chemokines CCL1 (agonist) and MC148 (antagonist), respectively, but not for small molecule binding. Finally, using in silico modeling, we predict an aromatic cluster of interaction partners for Tyr(187) in TMIV (Phe(171)) and TMV (Trp(194)). We show in vitro that these residues are crucial for the binding and action of MC148, thus supporting their participation in an aromatic cluster with Tyr(187). This aromatic cluster appears to be present in a large number of CC chemokine receptors and thereby could play a more general role to be exploited in future drug development targeting these receptors.

The goal in this paper was to review of biomarkers for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), with emphasis on neuroimaging biomarkers. Methods: A systematic review was conducted from existing literature that draws on markers and evidence for new measurement techniques of neuroimaging in AD, MCI and non-demented subjects. Selection criteria included: 1) age >= 60 years; 2) diagnosis of AD according to NIAAA criteria, 3) diagnosis of MCI according to NIAAA criteria with a confirmed progression to AD assessed by clinical follow-up, and 4) acceptable clinical measures of cognitive impairment, disability, quality of life, and global clinical assessments. Results: Seventy-two articles were included in the review. With the development of new radioligands of neuroimaging, today it is possible to measure different aspects of AD neuropathology, early diagnosis of MCI and AD become probable from preclinical stage of AD to AD dementia and non-AD dementia. Conclusions: The panel of noninvasive neuroimaging-biomarkers reviewed provides a set methods to measure brain structural and functional pathophysiological changes in vivo, which are closely associated with preclinical AD, MCI and non-AD dementia. The dynamic measures of these imaging biomarkers are used to predict the disease progression in the early stages and improve the assessment of therapeutic efficacy in these diseases in future clinical trials.

Islet autoantibodies are the most important immune biomarkers to diagnose autoimmune diabetes. We assayed four different islet autoantibodies in recently diagnosed adult non-insulin-requiring diabetes Chinese subjects to investigate the best antibody assay strategy for the correct diagnosis of these subjects. LADA China study is a nation-wide multicenter study conducted in diabetes patients from 46 university-affiliated hospitals in China. Non-insulin-treated newly diagnosed adult diabetes patients (n = 2388) were centrally assayed for glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody (GADA), protein tyrosine phosphatase-2 autoantibody (IA-2A), and zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8A) by radioligand assay and insulin autoantibody (IAA) by microtiter plate radioimmunoassay. Clinical data were determined locally. Two hundred and six (8.63 %) subjects were autoantibody positive, of which GADA identified 5.78 % (138/2388) of the total, but only 67 % (138/206) of the autoimmune cases. IA-2A, ZnT8A, and IAA were found in 1.51, 1.84, and 1.26 % of the total study subjects, respectively. When assaying three islet autoantibodies, the most effective strategy was the combination of GADA, ZnT8A, and IAA, which could identify 92.2 % (190/206) autoimmune diabetes patients. The clinical data showed that those subjects with positive GADA had lower random C-peptide than autoantibody negative subjects (P < 0.05). As with Europeans, GADA is the dominant autoantibody in this form of autoimmune diabetes in China, but in contrast to Europeans, screening should include other diabetes-associated autoantibodies.

Methods: Rats were injected stereotactically with LPS (50 mu g) in the right striatum and with saline in the left striatum. [(18) F]DPA-714 microPET, MRI, in vitro autoradiography and IHC studies were performed at different time points after LPS injection for 1 month. Results: Analysis of the microPET data demonstrated high uptake of the tracer in the LPS injected site with aft affected-to-non-affected side-binding potential ratio (BPright-to-left) of 3.0 at 3 days after LPS injection. This BP ratio decreased gradually over time to 0.9 at 30 days after LPS injection. In vitro autoradiography ([(18) F] DPA-714) and IHC (CD68, GFAP and TSPO) confirmed local neuroinflammation in this model. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI demonstrated BBB breakdown near the LPS injection site at day 1, which gradually resolved over time and was absent at 1 month after LPS injection. Conclusion: The LPS model is useful for first screening of newly developed tracers because of the easy design and the robust, unilateral inflammatory reaction allowing the use of the contralateral region as control. Additionally, this model can be used to test and follow up the benefits of anti-inflammatory therapies by non-invasive imaging. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have shown that the serotonin system is affected in Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive function, frequently impaired in PD, has been linked to the serotonin system. The aim of this study was to examine whether 5-HT1B receptor availability in the brain of healthy subjects and PD patients is associated with measures of cognitive function. MethodsTwelve control subjects and ten PD patients with normal mini-mental state examination scores were included in this study. Cognitive function was evaluated by assessment of semantic, episodic, and working memory, as well as fluency and visual attention. Creative ability, a measure of divergent thinking, was examined with the alternative uses of objects task. PET measurements were performed with the 5-HT1B receptor-radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 using the HRRT system. ResultsPD patients showed statistically significant lower measures of semantic and episodic memory, as well as creative ability, compared with control subjects. Statistically significant positive correlations were found in control subjects between creative ability and average 5-HT1B receptor availability in grey matter, and in PD patients between scores of Beck Depression Inventory-II and creative ability. ConclusionThough creativity has been conventionally linked to dopamine function, our findings in control subjects suggest a link between 5-HT1B receptor availability and creative ability. In PD patients, creative ability was significantly associated with depressive symptoms but not with 5-HT1B receptor availability. This finding deserves further investigation in future studies.

We tested NS4B against several DNA-encoded combinatorial libraries (DEL) and identified a single DEL feature that was subsequently progressed to off-DNA synthesis. The most active of the initial synthesized compounds had 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) of 50 to 130 nM in a NS4B radioligand binding assay and 300 to 500 nM in an HCV replicon assay. Chemical optimization yielded compounds with potencies as low as 20 nM in an HCV genotype 1b replicon assay, 500 nM against genotype 1a, and 5 mu M against genotype 2a. Through testing against other genotypes and genotype 2a-1b chimeric replicons and from resistance passage using the genotype 1b replicon, we confirmed that these compounds were acting on the proposed first transmembrane region of NS4B. A single sequence change (F98L) was identified as responsible for resistance, and it was thought to largely explain the relative lack of potency of this series against genotype 2a. Unlike other published series that appear to interact with this region, we did not observe sensitivity to amino acid substitutions at positions 94 and 105. The discovery of this novel compound series highlights ELT as a valuable approach for identifying direct-acting antivirals to nonenzymatic targets.

While 1a displayed low affinity at native AMPA, KA, and NMDA receptors, and at homomeric GluK1,3 receptors, the affinity for GluK2 was in the midmicromolar range (Ki = 136 mu M), 1b displayed low to midmicromolar range binding affinity at all the iGluRs (K-i = 9-126 mu M). In functional experiments (outside-out patches excised from transfected HEK293T cells), 100 mu M 1a partially blocked GluK1 (33% peak response), while GluK2 was unaffected (96% peak response). Furthermore, 1a was shown not to be an agonist at GluK1 and GluK2 at 100 mu M. On the other hand, 100 mu M 1b fully antagonized GluK1 (8% peak response) but only partially blocked GluK2 (33% peak response). An X-ray structure at 2.3 angstrom resolution of 1b in the GluK1-LBD (ligand-binding domain) disclosed an unexpected binding mode compared to the predictions made during the design phase; the quinoxaline moiety remains to act as an amino acid bioisostere, but the amino acid moiety is oriented into a new area within the GluK1 receptor. The structure of the GluK1-LBD with 1b showed a large variation in domain openings of the three molecules from 25 degrees G; to 49 degrees, demonstrating that the GluK1-LBD is capable of undergoing major domain movements.

Some scientific evidence seems to indicate that SZ is not a single disease entity, since there are patient groups with clear symptomatic, course and biomarker differences. SZ is characterized by a hyperdopaminergic state related to high dopamine D-2 receptor activity. It has also been proposed that there is a hypoadenosynergic state. Adenosine is a nucleoside widely distributed in the organism with neuromodulative and neuroprotective activity in the central nervous system. In the brain, the most abundant adenosine receptors are A(1)R and A(2A)R. In the present report, we characterize the presence of both receptors in human postmortem putamens of patients suffering SZ with real time TaqMan PCR, western blotting and radioligand binding assay. We show that A(1)R levels remain unchanged with respect to age-matched controls, whereas nearly fifty percent of patients have reduced A(2A)R, at the transcriptional and translational levels. Moreover, we describe how DNA methylation plays a role in the pathological A(2A)R levels with the bisulfite-sequencing technique. In fact, an increase in 5-methylcytosine percentage in the 5' UTR region of ADORA2A was found in those SZ patients with reduced A(2A)R levels. Interestingly, there was a relationship between the A(2A)/beta-actin ratio and motor disturbances as assessed with some items of the PANSS, AIMS and SAS scales. Therefore, there may be a subgroup of SZ patients with reduced striatal A(2A)R levels accompanied by an altered motor phenotype. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Structure-activity relationships of the N-terminus of calcitonin gene-related peptide: key roles of alanine-5 and threonine-6 in receptor activation	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						calcitonin gene-related peptide; efficacy; ligand binding; beta-arrestin; cAMP; structure-activity relationship; GPCR; amylin	AMYLIN RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; INTERNATIONAL UNION; EXTRACELLULAR LOOPS; CGRP RECEPTORS; ADRENOMEDULLIN; IDENTIFICATION; BINDING; FAMILY; RAT	Background and PurposeThe N-terminus of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is important for receptor activation, especially the disulphide-bonded ring (residues 1-7). However, the roles of individual amino acids within this region have not been examined and so the molecular determinants of agonism are unknown. This study has examined the role of residues 1, 3-6 and 8-9, excluding Cys-2 and Cys-7. Experimental ApproachCGRP derivatives were substituted with either cysteine or alanine; further residues were introduced at position 6. Their affinity was measured by radioligand binding and their efficacy by measuring cAMP production in SK-N-MC cells and -arrestin 2 translocation in CHO-K1 cells at the CGRP receptor. Key ResultsSubstitution of Ala-5 by cysteine reduced affinity 270-fold and reduced efficacy for production of cAMP in SK-N-MCs. Potency at -arrestin translocation was reduced by ninefold. Substitution of Thr-6 by cysteine destroyed all measurable efficacy of both cAMP and -arrestin responses; substitution with either alanine or serine impaired potency. Substitutions at positions 1, 4, 8 and 9 resulted in approximately 10-fold reductions in potency at both responses. Similar observations were made at a second CGRP-activated receptor, the AMY(1(a)) receptor. Conclusions and ImplicationsAla-5 and Thr-6 are key determinants of agonist activity for CGRP. Ala-5 is also very important for receptor binding. Residues outside of the 1-7 ring also contribute to agonist activity.

In continuation of our ongoing program aiming for the development of new small molecule cannabinoid ligands, we have synthesized a novel series of carbazole and y-carboline derivatives. The affinities of the newly synthesized compounds were determined by a competitive radioligand displacement assay for human CB2 cannabinoid receptor and rat CB1 cannabinoid receptor. Functional activity and selectivity at human CBI and CB2 receptors were characterized using receptor internalization and [35S]GTP-y-S assays. The structure activity relationship and optimization studies of the carbazole series have led to the discovery of a non-selective CBI and CB2 agonist, compound 4. Our subsequent research efforts to increase CB2 selectivity of this lead compound have led to the discovery of CB2 selective compound 64, which robustly internalized CB2 receptors. Compound 64 had potent inhibitory effects on pain hypersensitivity in a rat model of neuropathic pain. Other potent and CB2 receptor selective compounds, including compounds 63 and 68, and a selective CBI agonist, compound 74 were also discovered. In addition, we identified the CB2 ligand 35 which failed to promote CB2 receptor internalization and inhibited compound CP55,940-induced CB2 internalization despite a high CB2 receptor affinity. The present study provides novel tricyclic series as a starting point for further investigations of CB2 pharmacology and pain treatment. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Hypotheses about why these patterns exist include the "behavior hypothesis," which predicts that animals will down-regulate stress-induced CORT when CORT-induced behaviors are too likely to cause reproductive failure; and the "preparative hypothesis," which posits that baseline and stress-induced CORT will both be high at times of year with a higher incidence of predictable stressors. We tested predictions made by the behavior and predictive hypotheses about the CORT sensitivity of tissues involved in breeding: whole brain, hippocampus, and gonads. We used radioligand binding assays to examine gluco corticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) binding in free-living House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) at several different life history stages. We found lowest GR binding in whole brain during breeding; this suggests relative insensitivity of brain tissue to CORT at this time of year, which is consistent with predictions made by the behavior hypothesis. We found highest GR binding in whole brain in the pre-egg-laying period, which is consistent with the preparative hypothesis, given that this life stage is associated with a predictable increase in the likelihood of stressful events such as threats to territory and nest sites. However, we found no seasonal changes in GR or MR binding in gonads or hippocampus. Our results suggest that down-regulation of brain GR could be one way birds limit the negative effects of CORT release on breeding behavior, but further studies are necessary to understand the anatomic specificity of these changes.

In Vitro Pharmacological Characterization of Vilanterol, a Novel Long-Acting β<sub>2</sub>-Adrenoceptor Agonist with 24-Hour Duration of Action	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BETA-ADRENOCEPTOR AGONISTS; HIGH-AFFINITY; ASTHMA; RECEPTOR; BINDING; BETA(2)-AGONISTS; INDACATEROL; SELECTIVITY; ANTAGONISTS; SALMETEROL	Vilanterol trifenatate (vilanterol) is a novel, long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor (beta(2)-AR) agonist with 24 h activity. In this study, we describe the preclinical pharmacological profile of vilanterol using radioligand binding and cAMP studies in recombinant assays as well as human and guinea pig tissue systems to characterize beta(2)-AR binding and functional properties. Vilanterol displayed a subnanomolar affinity for the beta(2)-AR that was comparable with that of salmeterol but higher than olodaterol, formoterol, and indacaterol. In cAMP functional activity studies, vilanterol demonstrated similar selectivity as salmeterol for beta(2)- over beta(1)-AR and beta(3)-AR, but a significantly improved selectivity profile than formoterol and indacaterol. Vilanterol also showed a level of intrinsic efficacy that was comparable to indacaterol but significantly greater than that of salmeterol. In cellular cAMP production and tissue-based studies measuring persistence and reassertion, vilanterol had a persistence of action comparable with indacaterol and longer than formoterol. In addition, vilanterol demonstrated reassertion activity in both cell and tissue systems that was comparable with salmeterol and indacaterol but longer than formoterol. In human airways, vilanterol was shown to have a faster onset and longer duration of action than salmeterol, exhibiting a significant level of bronchodilation 22 h after treatment. From these investigations, the data for vilanterol are consistent, showing that it is a novel, potent, and selective beta(2)-AR receptor agonist with a long duration of action. This pharmacological profile combined with clinical data is consistent with once a day dosing of vilanterol in the treatment of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

However, its clinical use is limited due to the cutaneous flushing mediated by the nicotinic acid receptor HCA2. In the current study, we evaluated two partial agonists for HCA2, LUF6281 and LUF6283, with respect to their anti-dyslipidaemic potential and cutaneous flushing effect. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH In vitro potency and efficacy studies with niacin and the two HCA2 partial agonists were performed using HEK293T cells stably expressing human HCA2. Normolipidaemic C57BL/6 mice received either niacin or the HCA2 partial agonists (400 mg center dot kg-1 center dot day-1) once a day for 4 weeks for evaluation of their effects in vivo. KEY RESULTS Radioligand competitive binding assay showed Ki values for LUF6281 and LUF6283 of 3 and 0.55 mu M. [35S]-GTP?S binding revealed the rank order of their potency as niacin > LUF6283 > LUF6281. All three compounds reduced plasma VLDL-triglyceride concentrations similarly, while LUF6281 and LUF6283, in contrast to niacin, did not also exhibit the unwanted flushing side effect in C57BL/6 mice. Niacin reduced the expression of lipolytic genes HSL and ATGL in adipose tissue by 50%, whereas LUF6281 and LUF6283 unexpectedly did not. In contrast, the decrease in VLDL-triglyceride concentration induced by LUF6281 and LUF6283 was associated with a parallel >40% reduced expression of APOB within the liver. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The current study identifies LUF6281 and LUF6283, two HCA2 partial agonists of the pyrazole class, as promising drug candidates to achieve the beneficial lipid lowering effect of niacin without producing the unwanted flushing side effect.

However, it is unclear whether tramadol at the spinal level exerts an antinociceptive effect by directly binding with alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between alpha(2)-adrenoceptors and the antinociception of tramadol at the spinal level. The rat formalin test was designed to determine whether the intrathecal alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine could reverse the antinociceptive effect of intrathecal tramadol. The binding affinity of tramadol for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord was determined by radioligand binding assay using the labeled alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist [H-3]-yohimbine. The nociceptive test showed that intrathecal tramadol induced significant antinociception whereas pretreatment with intrathecal yohimbine partially reversed this antinociception. Scatchard analysis of the binding data showed [H-3]-yohimbine had high affinity (K (d) = 1.79 nM) for the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor in the rat spinal cord, and that tramadol inhibited specific binding of [H-3]-yohimbine with the spinal cord membranes with a high affinity constant (K (i) = 34.14 mu M) and an IC50 of 68.25 mu M, which indicated that tramadol was much less potent than [H-3]-yohimbine at binding with alpha(2)-adrenoceptors of the spinal cord. The results suggested that, with very weak binding affinity for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, the antinociception of intrathecal tramadol is partially related to alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, and its intrathecal antinociception may mainly involve its indirect activation of alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the spinal cord.

Characterization of the endocannabinoid system, CB<sub>1</sub> receptor signalling and desensitization in human myometrium	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						arrestin; anandamide; CB1 receptor; endocannabinoid; ERK	BETA-ARRESTINS; IN-VITRO; ANANDAMIDE; PREGNANCY; INTERNALIZATION; WOMEN; FERTILIZATION; CANNABINOIDS; IMPLANTATION; LIGANDS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The endocannabinoid plays vital roles in several aspects of reproduction, including gametogenesis, fertilization and parturition. However, little is known regarding the presence or role of the endocannabinoid system in myometrial function. Here the presence of the endocannabinoid system and signalling properties of cannabinoid receptors were characterized. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Components of the endocannabinoid system were identified using qRT-PCR, immunohistochemical, immunoblotting and radioligand binding experiments. Cannabinoid receptor signalling pathways were characterized using standard MAPK and second messenger assays. KEY RESULTS Primary myometrium expresses the endocannabinoid synthesizing enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidyl ethanolamine-specific phospholipase D, endocannabinoid degrading enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase and cannabinoid CB1, but not CB2 receptors or transient receptor potential vanilloid-type-1 channels. The CB1 receptor ligand anandamide caused a G alpha(i/o)-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase reducing intracellular cAMP levels, and G alpha(i/o), phosphoinositide-3-kinase, Src-kinase-dependent ERK activation. CB1 receptor-generated signals declined following continual anandamide stimulation, possibly due to ligand metabolism since free anandamide concentrations declined during the experiment from 2.5 mu M initially, to 500 nM after > 30 min. However, identical loss of CB1 receptor responsiveness occurred in the presence of the metabolically stable derivative methanandamide. Moreover, RNAi-mediated depletion of arrestin3 (a negative regulator of receptor signalling) prevented loss of CB1 receptor activity, enhancing and prolonging ERK signals. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The myometrium has the capacity to synthesize, respond to and degrade endocannabinoids. Furthermore, reduced CB1 receptor responsiveness occurs as a consequence of receptor desensitization, not agonist depletion and we identify a key role for arrestin3 in this process.

However, the specific role of the serotonin type 1B receptor has not been studied in patients with PTSD. Objective: To investigate in vivo serotonin type 1B receptor expression in individuals with PTSD, trauma-exposed control participants without PTSD (TC), and healthy (nontrauma-exposed) control participants (HC) using positron emission tomography and the recently developed serotonin type 1B receptor selective radiotracer [C-11] P943. Design: Cross-sectional positron emission tomography study under resting conditions. Setting: Academic and Veterans Affairs medical centers. Participants: Ninety-six individuals in 3 study groups: PTSD (n=49), TC (n=20), and HC (n=27). Main Outcome Measure: Regional [C-11] P943 binding potential (BPND) values in an a priori-defined limbic corticostriatal circuit investigated using multivariate analysis of variance and multiple regression analysis. Results: A history of severe trauma exposure in the PTSD and TC groups was associated with marked reductions in [C-11] P943 BPND in the caudate, the amygdala, and the anterior cingulate cortex. Participant age at first trauma exposure was strongly associated with low [C-11] P943 BPND. Developmentally earlier trauma exposure also was associated with greater PTSD symptom severity and major depression comorbidity. Conclusions: These data suggest an enduring effect of trauma history on brain function and the phenotype of PTSD. The association of early age at first trauma and more pronounced neurobiological and behavioral alterations in PTSD suggests a developmental component in the cause of PTSD.

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of antimuscarinic agents, oxybutynin and imidafenacin, on temporal changes in cognitive function and central mAChR occupancy in conscious monkeys (Macaca mulatto). Three conscious monkeys underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a mAChR radioligand N-[C-11]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([C-11]( +)3-MPB). The scan sequence was pre, and 1, 4, and 24 h post oral administration of oxybutynin (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) or imidafenacin (0.01-0.1 mg/kg). Maximum cognitive impairment was observed 1 h post-oxybutynin at oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, in a dose-dependent manner, and oxybutynin produced significant positive correlations between mAChR occupancy and cognitive impairment in the cortices, thalamus, brainstem, and striatum. The most significant correlation was observed in the brainstem, and then cortices. In contrast, imidafenacin did not induce discernible cognitive impairment, despite having obtained some lesser occupancy in cortices and brainstem. We propose that the thresholds of mAChR occupancy to produce cognitive impairment by antimuscarinic agents are ca. 30-40% in cortices and ca. 20-30% in brainstem, and a desirable drug for OAB treatment should not occupy central mAChR above these thresholds.

GPCR Ligand Dendrimer (GLiDe) Conjugates: Adenosine Receptor Interactions of a Series of Multivalent Xanthine Antagonists	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							HIGH-AFFINITY; FUNCTIONALIZED CONGENERS; DERIVATIVES; AGONIST; RADIOLIGAND; CHEMISTRY; EFFICIENT; ANALOGS	Previously, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) agonists were tethered from polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers to provide high receptor affinity and selectivity. Here, we prepared GPCR ligand-dendrimer (GLiDe) conjugates from a potent adenosine receptor (AR) antagonist; such agents are of interest for treating Parkinson's disease, asthma, and other conditions. Xanthine amine congener (XAC) was appended with an alkyne group on an extended C8 substituent for coupling by Cu(I)-catalyzed click chemistry to azide-derivatized G4 (fourth-generation) PAMAM dendrimers to form triazoles. These conjugates also contained triazole-linked PEG groups (8 or 22 moieties per 64 terminal positions) for increasing water-solubility and optionally prosthetic groups for spectroscopic characterization and affinity labeling. Human AR binding affinity increased progressively with the degree of xanthine substitution to reach K-i values in the nanomolar range. The order of affinity of each conjugate was hA(2A)AR > hA(3)AR > hA(1)AR, while the corresponding monomer was ranked hA(2A)AR > hA(1)AR >= hA(3)AR. The antagonist activity of the most potent conjugate 14 (34 xanthines per dendrimer) was examined at the G(i)-coupled A(1)AR Conjugate 14 at 100 nM right-shifted the AR agonist concentration-response curve in a cyclic AMP functional assay in a parallel manner, but at 10 nM (lower than its K-i value), it significantly suppressed the maximal agonist effect in calcium mobilization. This is the first systematic probing of a potent AR antagonist tethered on a dendrinier and its activity as a function of variable loading.

Compared with saturation binding with [3H]-raclopride, raclopride reduced [3H]-spiperone binding with to low potency in competition binding experiments. The present findings illustrate the ability of spiperone to inhibit [3H]-raclopride binding non-competitively. While raclopride only decreases the apparent K-D of [3H]-raclopride in saturation binding experiments, spiperone only decreases the number of sites to which [3H]-raclopride binds with high affinity. Also, while the IC50 of raclopride depends on the concentration of [3H]-raclopride in competition experiments, this is not the case for spiperone. Kinetic studies reveal that the binding of raclopride at its high affinity sites does not affect the association of subsequently added [3H]-spiperone nor the rebinding of freshly dissociated [3H]-spiperone to the same or surrounding receptors. Yet, spiperone does not affect the dissociation rate of [3H]-raclopride and raclopride does not affect the (genuine) dissociation rate of [3H]-spiperone. The easiest way to interpret the present findings in molecular terms is to assume that D-2L-receptors or their dimeric complexes possess two distinct binding sites: one with high affinity/accessibility for [3H]-raclopride and the other one with high affinity/accessibility for [3H]-spiperone. The ability of bound spiperone to inhibit high affinity raclopride binding while the reverse is not the case suggests for the occurrence of non-reciprocal allosteric interactions. These new findings could point at the occurrence of allosteric interactions between different classes of D-2-receptor antagonists.

The concept of MS binding assays follows closely the principle of traditional radioligand binding but uses MS for the quantification of bound marker thus eliminating the need for a radiolabelled ligand. The general strategy of increasing the throughput of this type of binding assay by the use of short columns is exemplified for NO 711 binding addressing GAT1, the most prevalent GABA transporter in the CNS. Employing short RP-18 columns with the dimension of 20 mm x 2 mm and 10 mm x 2 mm at flow rates up to 1000 mu L/min in an isocratic mode retention times of 8-9 s and chromatographic cycle times of 18s could be achieved. Based on the internal standard [H-2(10)]NO 711 fast chromatography methods were developed for four different columns that enabled quantification of NO 711 in a range from 50 pM up to 5 nM directly out of reconstituted matrix samples without further sample preparation. A validation of the established methods with respect to linearity, intra- and inter-batch accuracy and precision showed that the requirements according to the FDA guideline for bioanalytical methods are met. Furthermore the established short column methods were applied to the quantification of NO 711 in saturation experiments. The results obtained (i.e., K-d- and B-max-values) were almost identical as compared to those determined employing standard column dimension (55 mm x 2 mm). (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The corresponding reaction of 5 in the presence of a catalytic amount of BF3 center dot OEt2 gave a single isomer 8 under milder conditions with an improved yield. The experimental findings on the thermally induced and BF3-catalysed transformations were supported by calculations of the proposed mechanism at the BLYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Analogously, cyclization of D-secopregnene aldehyde 2 with N-substituted hydroxylamine derivatives (10b-e) under thermal conditions furnished N-functionalized isoxazolidines 11b-e diastereoselectively, via the corresponding alkenyl nitrones 7b-e. The activities of the 3-deacetylated compounds (9, 12b-e) were tested in vitro on rat testicular C-17,C-20-lyase: the radioligand incubation assay revealed that 9 exerted a moderate enzyme-inhibitory effect (IC50 = 26 mu M), while the other derivatives were found to decrease the enzyme activity by only 68-83%. The antiproliferative activities of the structurally related isoxazolidine derivatives were also determined in vitro on three malignant human cell lines (HeLa, MCF7, and A431) by the microculture tetrazolium assay. The highest cytotoxic activities were displayed by the N-benzyl-substituted derivative 12e (IC50: 14.00, 23.18 and 8.76 mM on HeLa, MCF7 and A341 cells, respectively).

PEGylated Dendritic Unimolecular Micelles as Versatile Carriers for Ligands of G Protein-Coupled Receptors	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							DRUG-DELIVERY; ADENOSINE RECEPTORS; DENDRIMERS; DERIVATIVES; AFFINITY; BRAIN	Despite its widespread application in nanomedicine, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) is seldom used for covalent modification of ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) due to potential steric complications. In order to study the influence of PEG chains on the biological activity of GPCR ligands bound to a common macromolecular carrier, we prepared a series of G3 polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers derivatized with Alexa Fluor 488, varying numbers of PEG(550)/PEG(750)/PEG(2000), and nucleoside moieties derived from the A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR) agonist CGS21680 (2-[4-(2-carboxylethyl)phenylethylamino]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine). These dendrimer conjugates were purified by size exclusion chromatography and characterized by H-1 NMR and MALDI MS. In radioligand binding assays, some PAMAM-PEG conjugates showed enhanced subtype-selectivity at the human A(2A) AR compared to monomeric ligands of comparable affinity. The functional potency was measured in the A(2A) AR-mediated activation of adenylate cyclase. and inhibition of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Interestingly, the dendrimer conjugate 10c bearing 11 PEG(750) chains (out of theoretical 32 amino end groups) and 14 nucleoside moieties was 5-fold more potent in A(2A) AR-mediated stimulation of cyclic AMP formation than 10d with 4 PEG(2000) chains and 21 nucleosides although the binding affinities of these 2 compounds were similar. Thus, a relatively small (<= 10 nm) multivalent ligand 10c modified for water solubility maintained high potency and displayed increased A2A AR binding selectivity over the monomeric nucleosides. The current study demonstrates the feasibility of using short PEG chains in the design of carriers that target ligand-receptor interactions.

Expression and vasoconstrictor function of anorexigenic peptides neuromedin U-25 and S in the human cardiovascular system	CARDIOVASCULAR RESEARCH			English	Article							HUMAN GASTROINTESTINAL-TRACT; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PORCINE SPINAL-CORD; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; U RECEPTORS; STRUCTURAL-CHARACTERIZATION; PHARMACOLOGICAL ACTIVITY; ORPHAN RECEPTOR; SMALL-INTESTINE; IDENTIFICATION	Neuromedin U-25 (NMU-25), a brain-gut peptide with anorexigenic actions, was paired with the G-protein-coupled receptors NMU1 and NMU2 in 2000. NMU-25 elicited a potent hypertensive effect in rats but little is known about its cardiovascular effects in humans. We examined the hypothesis that NMU fulfils the criteria for controlling vascular reactivity within the human cardiovascular system. The radioligand [I-125]-NMU-25 demonstrated specific, saturable, and high affinity (K-D = 0.26 +/- 0.06 nM) binding in the human left ventricle and coronary artery, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that mRNA encoding NMU1 predominated in these tissues. NMU-25-like immunoreactivity was detected in human plasma, left ventricle, coronary artery, saphenous vein, and epicardial adipose tissue, and both NMU-25 and a related peptide, neuromedin S (NMS), were identified by high-performance liquid chromatography in the left ventricle. NMU receptor and peptide were localized to endothelial cells, with the receptor also present on vascular smooth muscle cells. NMU-25 was a potent vasoconstrictor of isolated rings of human coronary and mammary artery and saphenous vein. Compared with NMU-25, NMS had a significantly reduced maximum response in saphenous vein, and the Arg165Trp variant of NMU-25, associated with childhood-onset obesity, was without effect. NMU-25 precursor mRNA was upregulated in the left ventricle from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and ischaemic heart disease. We have detected the expression of both NMU receptor and peptide in human cardiovascular tissues and have shown that NMU-25 and NMS act as potent vasoconstrictors in human vascular beds.

We have designed a set of highly selective and diverse pharmacological tools for studying the P2Y(1) receptor using a rational approach to ligand design. Based on the discovery that bisphosphate analogues of the P2Y(1) receptor agonist, ADP, are partial agonists/competitive antagonists of this receptor, an iterative approach was used to develop competitive antagonists with enhanced affinity and selectivity. Halogen substitutions of the 2-position of the adenine ring provided increased affinity while an N-6 methyl substitution eliminated partial agonist activity. Furthermore, various replacements of the ribose ring with symmetrically branched, phosphorylated acyclic structures revealed that the ribose is not necessary for recognition at the P2Y(1) receptor. Finally, replacement of the ribose ring with a five member methanocarba ring constrained in the Northern conformation conferred dramatic increases in affinity to both P2Y(1) receptor antagonists as well as agonists. These combined structural modifications have resulted in a series of selective high affinity antagonists of the P2Y(1) receptor, two broadly applicable radioligands, and a high affinity agonist capable of selectively activating the P2Y(1) receptor in human platelets. Complementary receptor modeling and computational ligand docking have provided a putative structural framework for the drug-receptor interactions. A similar rational approach is being applied to develop selective ligands for other subtypes of P2Y receptors.	[Houston, Dayle; Harden, T.

Role of GSH in estrone sulfate binding and translocation by the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1)	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							MEMBRANE-SPANNING DOMAIN; CANCER CELL-LINE; NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; LEUKOTRIENE C-4; MRP1 ABCC1; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; VINCRISTINE TRANSPORT; SUBSTRATE-SPECIFICITY; GLUTATHIONE TRANSPORT	Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1/ABCC1) is an ATP-dependent efflux pump that can confer resistance to multiple anticancer drugs and transport conjugated organic anions. Unusually, transport of several MRP1 substrates requires glutathione (GSH). For example, estrone sulfate transport by MRP1 is stimulated by GSH, vincristine is co-transported with GSH, or GSH can be transported alone. In the present study, radioligand binding assays were developed to investigate the mechanistic details of GSH-stimulated transport of estrone sulfate by MRP1. We have established that estrone sulfate binding to MRP1 requires GSH, or its non-reducing analogue S-methyl GSH (S-mGSH), and further that the affinity (K-d) of MRP1 for estrone sulfate is 2.5-fold higher in the presence of S-mGSH than GSH itself. Association kinetics show that GSH binds to MRP1 first, and we propose that GSH binding induces a conformational change, which makes the estrone sulfate binding site accessible. Binding of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogues to MRP1 decreases the affinity for estrone sulfate. However, GSH (or S-mGSH) is still required for estrone sulfate binding, and the affinity for GSH is unchanged. Estrone sulfate affinity remains low following hydrolysis of ATP. The affinity for GSH also appears to decrease in the post-hydrolytic state. Our results indicate ATP binding is sufficient for reconfiguration of the estrone sulfate binding site to lower affinity and argue for the presence of a modulatory GSH binding site not associated with transport of this tripeptide. A model for the mechanism of GSH-stimulated estrone sulfate transport is proposed.

Few studies exist that study the mother/offspring dyad of neurological effects of maternal cocaine abuse. The present study was designed to study alterations in D-2, D-3 and sigma receptor density in nucleus accumbens and striatum of dams and male and female offspring following gestational cocaine. Long-Evans female rats were implanted with an intravenous (i.v.) access port prior to breeding and were administered saline or 3.0mg/kg of cocaine from gestational day (GD) GD8-20 (1 injection/day-GD8-14, 2 injections/day-GD 15-20). Offspring were raised by maternal dams and allowed to mature until postnatal days 31-35, at which time dams and offspring were sacrificed for assay of radioligand binding. In dams, decreased D-2 (24.6%) and D-3 (36.9%) binding was observed in striatum. Female offspring displayed no differences in receptor binding in either region. Male offspring displayed decreased D, receptor binding (27.1%) in nucleus accumbens and increased D-3 (75.2% and 33.5%) and sigma receptor binding (73.4% and 53.1%) in accumbens and striatum, respectively. Collectively, these data clearly demonstrate that male offspring exhibit significant alterations in D2, D3 and sigma receptor binding. These results suggest that dams and offspring display long-lasting alterations (5weeks) in dopamine receptor binding. These alterations in dopamine and sigma receptor binding in offspring following prenatal cocaine and rearing by maternal dams are sex specific and could have profound effects on the development of behavior.

To better understand the changes in cortical glutamatergic markers in schizophrenia, we measured the binding of radioligands to the ionotropic glutamate receptors (N-methyl D-aspartate, [H-3] CGP39653, [H-3] MK-801), amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole ([H-3] AMPA), kainate ([H-3] kainate), and the high-affinity glutamate uptake site ([H-3] aspartate) using in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography and levels of mRNA for kainate receptors using in situ hybridization in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 20 subjects with schizophrenia and 20 controls matched for age and sex. Levels of [H-3] kainate binding were significantly decreased in cortical laminae I-II (p=0.01), III-IV (p<0.05), and V-VI (p<0.01) from subjects with schizophrenia. By contrast, levels of [H-3] MK-801, [H-3] AMPA, [H-3] aspartate, or [H-3] CGP39653 binding did not differ between the diagnostic cohorts. Levels of mRNA for the GluR5 subunit were decreased overall (p<0.05), with no changes in levels of mRNA for GluR6, GluR7, KA1, or KA2 in tissue from subjects with schizophrenia. These data indicate that the decreased number of kainate receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia may result, in part, from reduced expression of the GluR5 receptor subunits.

Because somatostatin receptors are found in a high percentage of human non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), we evaluated the antitumor effect of AN-238 in 2 human NHL cell lines in vivo. Nude mice bearing xenografts of RL and HT human NHL were treated with AN-238 or its components at equimolar doses, and antitumor effects were determined. Expression of mRNA for somatostatin receptor subtypes was measured by RT-PCR, and the presence of somatostatin receptors was determined by radioligand binding. Toxicity was evaluated by following white blood cell count (WBC) and body weight. AN-238 significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited growth of RL and HT xenografts and prolonged the tumor doubling time. Cytotoxic radical AN-201, the unconjugated mixture of somatostatin analogue RC-121 and AN-201 or RC-121 alone had no significant effects. Blockade of somatostatin receptors by excess RC-121 abolished the effect of AN-238, demonstrating targeting. Expression of somatostatin receptors was not changed after repeated treatment with AN-238. AN-201, but not AN-238, significantly lowered the WBC and caused a greater decrease in body weight than AN-238. Our findings demonstrate that targeted chemotherapy with AN-238 can strongly inhibit the growth of NHL cells, which express somatostatin receptors. AN-238 could be considered for the treatment for patients with NHL. (C) 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We address three topics in this study: (a) the relationship between withdrawal time of lead exposure, and beta-adrenergic receptor, plasma catecholamine level, blood pressure. and lead level in heart. aorta. and kidney in lead-induced hypertensive rats after lead exposure stopped; (b) the relationship between blood pressure and beta-adrenergic receptor in heart, aorta. and kidney; (c) the estimation of relationship between lead withdrawn and the variation of beta-adrenergic system. Wistar rats were chronically fed with 2% lead acetate (experimental group) and water (control group) for 2 months. The rats were divided into 8 groups by withdrawal time of lead exposure stopped. Plasma catecholamine level was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Radioligand binding assay was measured by a method that fulfilled strict criteria of beta-adrenergic receptor using the ligand [I-125]iodocyanopindolol. The levels of lead were determined by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that a close relation between reduced lead level and the plasma catecholamine level decreased aorta beta-adrenergic receptor increased. kidney P-adrenergic receptor diminished. heart beta-adrenergic receptor increased, and blood pressure dropped after lead exposure withdrawn. The study on the regulation of beta-adrenergic system in lead-induced hypertension after lead withdrawn might also provide insight about the nature of this disease state.

However, the pharmacology underpinning the effects of methadone is little studied despite controversies about dosing in relation to outcome. We therefore examined the relationship between methadone dose and occupation of opioid receptors in brain using the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [C-11] diprenorphine in humans and rats. Eight opioid-dependent subjects stable on their substitute methadone ( 18 - 90 mg daily) had an [C-11] diprenorphine PET scan at predicted peak plasma levels of methadone. These were compared with eight healthy controls. No difference in [C-11] diprenorphine binding was found between the groups, with no relationship between methadone dose and occupancy. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats that had been given an acute i.v. injection of methadone hydrochloride (0.35, 0.5, 0.7, or 1.0 mg kg(-1)) before [C-11] diprenorphine showed a dose-dependent increase in biodistribution but no reduction in [C-11] diprenorphine binding. We suggest that the lack of a dose-dependent relationship between methadone dose, either given chronically in human or acutely in rat, and occupancy of opioid receptor measured with [C-11] diprenorphine PET is related to efficacy of this opioid agonist at very low levels of opioid receptor occupancy. This has implications for understanding the actions of methadone in comparison with other opioid drugs such as partial agonists and antagonists.

Relationships between structures and activity	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DECAPEPTIDE AGONISTS; ISCHEMIA-REPERFUSION; C-TERMINUS; IN-VITRO; RAT; ANAPHYLATOXIN; INJURY; CONFORMATION; INFLAMMATION; INHIBITION	Human C5a is a plasma protein with potent chemoattractant and pro-inflammatory properties, and its overexpression correlates with severity of inflammatory diseases. C5a binds to its G protein-coupled receptor (C5aR) on polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) through a high-affinity helical bundle and a low-affinity C terminus, the latter being solely responsible for receptor activation. Potent and selective C5a antagonists are predicted to be effective anti-inflammatory drugs, but no pharmacophore for small molecule antagonists has yet been developed, and it would significantly aid drug design. We have hypothesized that a turn conformation is important for activity of the C terminus of C5a and herein report small cyclic peptides that are stable turn mimics with potent antagonism at C5aR on human PMNLs. A comparison of solution structures for the C terminus of C5a, small acyclic peptide ligands, and cyclic antagonists supports the importance of a turn for receptor binding. Competition between a cyclic antagonist and either C5a or an acyclic agonist for C5aR on PMNLs supports a common or overlapping binding site on the C5aR. Structure-activity relationships for 60 cyclic analogs were evaluated by competitive radioligand binding with C5a (affinity) and myeloperoxidase release (antagonist potency) from human PMNLs, with 20 compounds having high antagonist potencies (IC50, 20 nM(-1) muM). Computer modeling comparisons reveal that potent antagonists share a common cyclic backbone shape, with affinity-determining side chains of defined volume projecting from the cyclic scaffold. These results define a new pharmacophore for C5a antagonist development and advance our understanding of ligand recognition and receptor activation of this G protein-coupled receptor.

We have examined the effect of chronic administration of the SSRI fluoxetine or the tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline on 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in serotonergic cell body areas, and cortical and limbic structures using quantitative autoradiography. Treatment of rats with fluoxetine, but not amitriptyline, resulted in an attenuation of 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in the dorsal and median raphe-nuclei. The binding of the antagonist radioligand [H-3]MPPF to 5-HT1A receptor sites was not altered, suggesting that the observed changes in 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding were not due to changes in receptor number. Thus, the desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal and median raphe following chronic SSRI treatment appears to be due to a reduced capacity of the 5-HT1A receptor to activate G protein. By contrast, no significant change in postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding was observed in any of the forebrain areas examined following chronic antidepressant treatment. Thus, changes in postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor-mediated responses reported to follow chronic SSRI or tricyclic antidepressant administration most likely occur distal to receptor-G protein interaction, perhaps at the level of effector, or involving changes in neuronal function at the system or circuit level.

Studies were performed using [H-3]mesulergine, an antagonist with high affinity at 5-HT7 receptors. In the presence of a combination of masking drugs to inhibit the binding of the radioligand to other receptors at which it has affinity, such as 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and dopamine D-2 receptors as well as alpha(1)/alpha(2)-adrenoceptors, [H-3]mesulergine labelled two sites with pK(D) values of 9.7 +/- 0.7 and 7.4 +/- 0.4 and B-max values of 37.2 +/- 21.4 and 247.8 +/- 62.1 fmol mg protein(-1), respectively. Displacement studies also indicated the presence of non-homogenous binding sites, which showed a significant correlation (Pearson correlation factors of 0.91 and 0.85) with the 5-HT2C and 5-HT7 receptors, respectively. Total binding to the 5-HT2C receptor was minimal; < 30% of the total specific receptor binding. The antagonist order of affinity at the greater proportion of receptors was: risperidone (pK(i):9.7) > lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 9.4) > metergoline (7.7) > mesulergine (7.5) > ritanserin (6.3) > pindolol (5.6). This receptor also showed a high affinity for 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT; 10.6) and moderate affinity for (+/-)-2-dipropyl-amino-8-hydroxy-1,2,3,4,-tetrahydronaphthalene (8-OH-DPAT; 7.2), which is typical of the 5-HT7 receptor profile.

Our aim was to investigate the frequency, clinical characteristics, and human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genotypes of idiopathic T1D. Methods: We enrolled 1205 newly diagnosed T1D patients in our analysis. To exclude monogenic diabetes in autoantibody-negative patients, we utilised a custom monogenic diabetes gene panel. Individuals negative for autoantibodies and subsequently excluded for monogenic diabetes were diagnosed with idiopathic T1D. We collected clinical characteristics, measured islet autoantibodies by radioligand assay and obtained HLA data. Results: After excluding 11 patients with monogenic diabetes, 284 cases were diagnosed with idiopathic T1D, accounting for 23.8% (284/1194) of all newly diagnosed T1D cases. When compared with autoimmune T1D, idiopathic T1D patients showed an older onset age, higher body mass index among adults, lower haemoglobin A1c, higher levels of fasting C-peptide and 2-h postprandial C-peptide, and were likely to have type 2 diabetes (T2D) family history and carry 0 susceptible HLA haplotype (all p < 0.01). A lower proportion of individuals carrying 2 susceptible HLA haplotypes in idiopathic T1D was observed in the adult-onset subgroup (15.7% vs. 38.0% in child-onset subgroup, p < 0.001) and in subgroup with preserved beta-cell function (11.0% vs. 30.1% in subgroup with poor beta-cell function, p < 0.001). Multivariable correlation analyses indicated that being overweight, having T2D family history and lacking susceptible HLA haplotypes were associated with negative autoantibodies. Conclusions: Idiopathic T1D represents about 1/4 of newly diagnosed T1D, with adult- onset and preserved beta- cell function patients showing lower HLA susceptibility and more insulin resistance.

In concentrations ranging from 3-300 mu M, MB inhibited K+ currents (IC50: 22.4 mu M) activated by cromakalim, which activates K-ATP channels. MB inhibited cromakalim-activated K+ currents in a noncompetitive and voltage-independent manner. The respective EC50 and slope values for cromakalim-activation of K+ currents were 194 +/- 21 mu M and 0.91 for controls, and 206 +/- 24 mu M and 0.87 in the presence of 30 mu M MB. The inhibition of cromakalim-induced K+ currents by MB was not altered by pretreatment with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, which suggests that MB does not influence Ca2+-activated second messenger pathways. K+ currents mediated through a C-terminally deleted form of Kir6.2 (Kir Delta C26), which does not contain the sulfonylurea receptor, were still inhibited by MB, indicating direct interaction of MB with the channel-forming Kir6.2 subunit. The binding characteristics of the K-ATP ligand [H-3]glibenclamide are not altered by MB in a concentration range between 1 mu M-1 mM, as suggested by radioligand binding assay. The presence of a membrane permeable cGMP analogue (8-Br-cGMP, 100 mu M) and a guanylate cyclase activator (BAY 58-2667, 3 mu M) did not affect the inhibitory effects of MB, suggesting that MB does not inhibit cromakalim-activated K+ currents through guanylate cyclase. Collectively, these results suggest that MB directly inhibits cromakalim-activated K+ currents in follicular cells of Xenopus oocytes.

The PSMA-inhibitor complexations have been analyzed by comparing their binding modes, secondary structures, root-mean-square deviations, noncovalent interactions, principal components, and binding free energies. PSMA is a cell surface glycoprotein upregulated in cancerous cells and can be targeted by boron-labeled inhibitors for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). The effective BNCT requires the selective boron delivery to the tumor area and highly specific PSMA-mediated cellular uptake by tumor. Thus, a potent inhibitor must exhibit both high binding affinity and high boron density. The computational results suggest that the chemical nature of inhibitors affects the binding mode and their association with PSMA is primarily dominated by hydrogen bonding, salt bridge, electrostatic, and pi-pi interactions. The binding free energies (-28.0, -15.2, -43.9, -23.2, and -38.2 kcal/mol) calculated using lambda-dynamics for all inhibitors (In1 - 5) predict preferential binding that is in accordance with experimental data. Among all inhibitors, In5 was found to be the best candidate for BNCT. The binding of this inhibitor to PSMA preserved its overall secondary structure. These results provide computational insights into the coordination flexibility of PSMA and its interaction with various inhibitors. They can be used for the design and synthesis of efficient BNCT agents with improved drug selectivity and high boron percentage.

FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						abacavir; adenosine triphosphate; leukocyte-endothelium interactions; cardiovascular diseases; allosteric modulator		The cardiovascular toxicity of Abacavir is related to its purinergic structure. Purinergic P2X7-receptors (P2X7R), characterized by activation by high concentrations of ATP and with high plasticity, seem implicated. We appraise the nature of the interplay between Abacavir and P2X7R in generating vascular inflammation. The effects of Abacavir on leukocyte-endothelium interactions were compared with those of its metabolite carbovir triphosphate (CBV-TP) or ATP in the presence of apyrase (ATP-ase) or A804598 (P2X7R-antagonist). CBV-TP and ATP levels were evaluated by HPLC, while binding of Abacavir, CBV-TP and ATP to P2X7R was assessed by radioligand and docking studies. Hypersensitivity studies explored a potential allosteric action of Abacavir. Clinical concentrations of Abacavir (20 mu mol/L) induced leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions by specifically activating P2X7R, but the drug did not show affinity for the P2X7R ATP-binding site (site 1). CBV-TP levels were undetectable in Abacavir-treated cells, while those of ATP were unaltered. The effects of Abacavir were Apyrase-dependent, implying dependence on endogenous ATP. Exogenous ATP induced a profile of proinflammatory actions similar to Abacavir, but was not entirely P2X7R-dependent. Docking calculations suggested ATP-binding to sites 1 and 2, and Abacavir-binding only to allosteric site 2. A combination of concentrations of Abacavir (1 mu mol/L) and ATP (0.1 mu mol/L) that had no effect when administered separately induced leukocyte-endothelium interactions mediated by P2X7R and involving Connexin43 channels. Therefore, Abacavir acts as a positive allosteric modulator of P2X7R, turning low concentrations of endogenous ATP themselves incapable of stimulating P2X7R into a functional proinflammatory agonist of the receptor.

Our previous clinical and basic studies have demonstrated that protopanaxadiol ginsenoside-Rd (Rd), a monomer compound extracted from Panax ginseng or Panax notoginseng, has neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke, probably due to its ability to block Ca2+ overload, an usual consequence of the overactivation of NMDA receptor (NMDAR). As an extending study, we explored here whether Rd exerted its neuroprotection as a novel NMDAR blocker. Our whole-cell patch-clamp results showed that Rd reduced NMDAR currents of cultured rat cortical neurons (EC50=7.7 mu M) dose-dependently by acting on extrasynaptic NMDAR NR2b subunit. However, unexpectedly, cell transfection and radioligand binding assays revealed that Rd did not bind to the NMDAR channel directly. Alternatively, it inhibited the phosphorylation of NR2b at Ser-1303, a target of death associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1). Moreover, cell-based and cell-free enzymatic assays showed that Rd did not inhibit the activity of DAPK1 directly, but blocked the activity of calcineurin, a key phosphatase for activating DAPK1. Importantly, other protopanaxadiol ginsenosides were also found to have potential inhibitory effects on calcineurin activity. Furthermore, as expected, calcineurin inhibition by cyclosporin A could mimic Rd's effects and protect against NMDA-, oxygen glucose deprivation- or transient ischemic stroke-induced neuronal injury. Therefore, our present study provided the first evidence that Rd could exert an inhibitive effect on NMDAR-triggered currents and sequential excitotoxicity through mitigation of DAPK1-mediated NR2b phosphorylation by attenuating calcineurin activity.

Easy applicability, low side-effects and negligible costs facilitated its wide-spread application in efforts to modulate brain function, however neuronal mechanisms of tDCS are insufficiently understood. Hence, we investigated the immediate impact of tDCS on the brain's glucose consumption in a continuous infusion protocol with the radioligand 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET). This novel functional PET (fPET) method is capable to reliably detect area-specific and dynamic absolute glucose demand related to neuronal activity in a single molecular imaging session. Fifteen healthy subjects underwent tDCS at 0.5, 1 and 2 mA (mA) at the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, cathodal right) for 10 min during functional [F-18]FDG-PET lasting 70 min. Active stimulation compared to sham did not yield significant changes in glucose consumption at any tested stimulation intensity in this paradigm. Exploratory investigation of aftereffects provided hints for increased glucose consumption with a delay of 5 min at 1 mA in the right posterior temporal cortex. This is the first study investigating changes of glucose consumption in the brain during tDCS. The lack of immediately increased glucose consumption indicates that energy demanding processes in the brain such as glutamatergic signaling might not be immediately increased by tDCS. However, our results implicate the need of fPET investigations for medium-term and long-term effects.

They may have additional therapeutic utility also in the absence of opioid agonist drugs, but the onset and duration of action at brain MORs have been inadequately characterized to allow such projections. This study provides initial characterization of brain MOR availability at high temporal resolution following intranasal (IN) naloxone administration to healthy volunteers in the absence of a competing opioid agonist. Fourteen participants were scanned twice using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11] carfentanil, a selective MOR agonist radioligand. Concentrations of naloxone in plasma and MOR availability (relative to placebo) were monitored from 0 to 60 min and at 300-360 min post naloxone. Naloxone plasma concentrations peaked at similar to 20 min post naloxone, associated with slightly delayed development of brain MOR occupancy (half of peak occupancy reached at similar to 10 min). Estimated peak occupancies were 67 and 85% following 2 and 4 mg IN doses, respectively. The estimated half-life of occupancy disappearance was similar to 100 min. The rapid onset of brain MOR occupancy by IN naloxone, evidenced by the rapid onset of its action in opioid overdose victims, was directly documented in humans for the first time. The employed high temporal-resolution PET method establishes a model that can be used to predict brain MOR occupancy from plasma naloxone concentrations. IN naloxone may have therapeutic utility in various addictions where brain opioid receptors are implicated, such as gambling disorder and alcohol use disorder.

Methods: This was an analysis of the first 30 consecutive patients who underwent Lu-177-PSMA therapy. Biochemical response was defined as prostate-specific antigen decrease of 50% or greater. Clinical toxicity was based on standardized physician's report, and biochemical and hematological toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. Clinical response was objectified in terms of severity of pain and usage of analgesics after separate treatment cycles. Results: Thirty patients with advanced PCa received therapy cycles with 6 GBq Lu-177-PSMA (median, 4; range, 1-6). After the first cycle, usage of analgesics decreased in 45% of the patients. During treatment, maximum prostate-specific antigen decrease was 50% or greater and 90% or greater in 57% and 24% of the patients, respectively. Despite CTCAE grades III and IVanemia occurring in 2 patients (7%), all other newly originated biochemical toxicity was limited tomaximum CTCAE grades I and II. Grade II xerostomia occurred in 17% of the patients. During a median follow-up length of 13.7 months (range, 9.8-32.3 months), median overall survival from start of the first therapy cycle was 11.3 months (range, 1.4-32.3 months). Conclusions: These results confirmthe favorable safety and efficacy profile of Lu-177-PSMA, even up to 6 treatment cycles. Therefore, Lu-177-PSMA seems a promising therapeutic strategy for metastatic castration-resistant PCa patients. However, randomized controlled trials are warranted to obtain robust data.

In this study, to translate [F-18]DAA1106 for clinical studies, we performed automated syntheses of [F-18]DAA1106 using the spirocyclic iodonium ylide (1) as a radiolabelling precursor and conducted preclinical studies including positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of TSPO in ischemic rat brains. Radiofluorination of the ylide precursor 1 with [18F]F- , followed by HPLC separation and formulation, produced the [F-18]DAA1106 solution for injection in 6% average (n = 10) radiochemical yield (based on [F-18]F-) with > 98% radiochemical purity and molar activity of 60-100 GBq/innol at the end of synthesis. The synthesis time was 87 min from the end of bombardment. The automated synthesis achieved [F-18]DAA1106 with sufficient radioactivity available for preclinical and clinical use. Biodistribution study of [F-18]DAA1106 showed a low uptake of radioactivity in the mouse bones. Metabolite analysis showed that > 96% of total radioactivity in the mouse brain at 60 min after the radiotracer injection was unmetabolized [F-18]DAA1106. PET study of ischemic rat brains visualized ischemic areas with a high uptake ratio (1.9 +/- 0.3) compared with the contralateral side. We have provided evidence that [F-18]DAA1106 could be routinely produced for clinical studies.

Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of <i>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</i> clinical isolates, their comparison with strain GG and their recognition by complement system	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STREPTOCOCCUS-PYOGENES INFECTIONS; LACTIC-ACID BACTERIA; FACTOR-H; BIOFILM FORMATION; PROBIOTIC USE; M PROTEIN; AGGREGATION; ADHESION; BINDING; PLATELETS	Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains are ubiquitous in fermented foods, and in the human body where they are commensals naturally present in the normal microbiota composition of gut, vagina and skin. However, in some cases, Lactobacillus spp. have been implicated in bacteremia. The aim of the study was to examine the genomic and immunological properties of 16 clinical blood isolates of L. rhamnosus and to compare them to the well- studied L. rhamnosus probiotic strain GG. Blood cultures from bacteremic patients were collected at the Helsinki University Hospital laboratory in 2005-2011 and L. rhamnosus strains were isolated and characterized by genomic sequencing. The capacity of the L. rhamnosus strains to activate serum complement was studied using immunological assays for complement factor C3a and the terminal pathway complement complex (TCC). Binding of complement regulators factor H and C4bp was also determined using radioligand assays. Furthermore, the isolated strains were evaluated for their ability to aggregate platelets and to form biofilms in vitro. Genomic comparison between the clinical L. rhamnosus strains showed them to be clearly different from L. rhamnosus GG and to cluster in two distinct lineages. All L. rhamnosus strains activated complement in serum and none of them bound complement regulators. Four out of 16 clinical blood isolates induced platelet aggregation and/or formed more biofilms than L. rhamnosus GG, which did not display platelet aggregation activity nor showed strong biofilm formation. These findings suggest that clinical L. rhamnosus isolates show considerable heterogeneity but are clearly different from L. rhamnosus GG at the genomic level. All L. rhamnosus strains are still normally recognized by the human complement system.

The progress of these disorders can be studied through imaging alpha 7-nAChR with positron emission tomography (PET). [F-18]ASEM is a novel and potent alpha 7-nAChR PET radioligand showing great promise in recent tests. However, the mechanism of the molecular interaction between [F-18] ASEM and alpha 7-nAChR is still unclear. In this paper, the binding profile of [F-18] ASEM to a chimera structure of alpha 7-nAChR was investigated with molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and metadynamics simulation methods. We found that [F-18] ASEM binds at the same site as the crystallized agonist epibatidine but with a different binding mode. The dibenzo[b, d] thiophene ring has a different orientation compared to the pyridine ring of epibatidine and has van der Waals interactions with residues from loop C on one side and p-p stacking interaction with Trp53 on the other side. The conformation of Trp53 was found to have a great impact on the binding of [F-18] ASEM. Six binding modes in terms of the side chain dihedral angles chi(1) and chi(2) of Trp53 were discovered by metadynamics simulation. In the most stable binding mode, Trp53 adopts a different conformation from that in the crystalline structure and has a rather favorable pi-pi stacking interaction with [F-18] ASEM. We believe that these discoveries can be valuable for the development of novel PET radioligands.

By using the regional volume-of-interest masks extracted from MRIs, regional binding values of standardized uptake value ratios and volumes were measured. We compared regional binding values among 3 diagnostic groups and identified correlations among the regional binding values, performance in each cognitive function test, and regional atrophy.Results:F-18-AV-1451 binding was increased only in the entorhinal cortex in patients with MCI, while patients with AD exhibited greater binding in most cortical regions. In the 35 patients with MCI and AD, F-18-AV-1451 binding in most of the neocortex increased with a worsening of global cognitive function. The visual and verbal memory functions were associated with the extent of F-18-AV-1451 binding, especially in the medial temporal regions. The F-18-AV-1451 binding also correlated with the severity of regional atrophy of the cerebral cortex.Conclusions:Tau PET imaging with F-18-AV-1451 could serve as an in vivo biomarker for the evaluation of AD-related tau pathology and monitoring disease progression. The accumulation of pathologic tau is more closely related to functional and structural deterioration in the AD spectrum than -amyloid.

The polymorphic binding site on multimeric A beta for current radioligands, however, is little understood. In this study, we investigated the binding of several radioligands including C-11-Pittsburgh Compound B (C-11-PiB), H-3-AZD2184, and two recently developed compounds, I-125-DRM106 and I-125-DRK092, with unique presubicular A beta deposits lacking interaction with the commonly used amyloid dyes FSB. C-11-PiB, H-3-AZD2184, and I-125-DRK092 showed overt binding to presubicular A beta deposits, while I-125-DRM106 barely bound to these aggregates despite its strong binding in the hippocampal CA1 sector. Unlike neuritic plaques in the CA1, A beta lesions in the presubiculum were not accompanied by inflammatory gliosis enriched with 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Thus, there are at least two different components in A beta aggregates providing distinct binding sites for the current amyloid radioligands, and one of these binding components is distinctly present in the presubicular A beta deposits. Amyloid radioligands lacking affinity for this component, such as I-125-DRM106, may selectively capture All deposits tightly associated with TSPO neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration as exemplified by CA1 neuritic plaques. Hence, comparative autoradiographic assessments of radioligand binding in CA1 and presubiculum could serve for the development of an amyloid PET imaging agent visualizing neurotoxicity-related A beta pathologies.

J	Nagler, R; Cohen, S; Gavish, M				Nagler, Rafael; Cohen, Shiri; Gavish, Moshe			The Effect of Cigarette Smoke on the Translocator Protein (TSPO) in Cultured Lung Cancer Cells	JOURNAL OF CELLULAR BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article						LUNG CANCER CELLS; TSPO; CIGARETTE SMOKE; CELL SURVIVAL	18 KDA; APOPTOSIS INDUCTION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CYTOCHROME-C; IRON; LIGANDS; BINDING; DEATH; PROLIFERATION; INVOLVEMENT	Lung cancer is prevalent in cigarette smokers. The mitochondrial membrane translocator protein (TSPO), is thought to protect cells from free radical damage. We examined the effect of cigarette smoke (CS) (containing free radicals) alone and in the presence of saliva (containing redox active free iron), on survival of H1299 lung cancer cells and on their mitochondrial characteristics, and whether TSPO binding was influenced by CS and by saliva. We exposed H1299 cells to CS in the presence/absence of saliva and also characterized TSPO binding in the cells using [3H]PK 11195 as a radioligand. CS induced a significant drop in mitochondrial potential (m), while addition of saliva did not lead to further loss of m (42.5% vs. 39.85%). Scatchard analysis of the saturation curve of [3H]PK 11195 binding (0.2-6nM final concentration) yielded a straight-line plot (R= 0.9). Average Bmax value was 3274 +/- 787fmol/mg of protein, and average Kd value was 9.2 +/- 1.3nM. Benzodiazepine diazepam partially prevented decrease in cell survival following exposure to CS and redox active iron containing media (saliva) while benzodiazepine clonazepam did not, indicating that this effect is TSPO-specific. Exposure of cells to CS resulted in alternation of biomolecules expressed by CLs peroxidation, reduction of TSPO binding, and depletion of the mitochondrial potential. This irreversible damage was enhanced in the presence of saliva. All these modulations may result in cellular death increase following CS exposure, enhanced in the presence of saliva. J. Cell.

Is metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 upregulated in prefrontal cortex in fragile X syndrome?	MOLECULAR AUTISM			English	Article						Fragile X mental retardation protein; Fragile X syndrome; Glutamate receptor; mGluR5; Receptor density; Receptor expression	MENTAL-RETARDATION PROTEIN; MOUSE MODEL; AUTISM	Background: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common inherited form of intellectual disability caused by loss of function of the fragile X mental retardation protein. Recent animal studies suggest that upregulated downstream signaling by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) might be an important mechanism for cognitive and behavioral abnormalities associated with FXS. However, mGluR5 density in human FXS remains unknown. Methods: Receptor binding and protein expression were measured in the postmortem prefrontal cortex of 14 FXS patients or carriers and 17 age-and sex-matched control subjects without neurological disorders. In-vitro binding assays were performed using [H-3]-labeled 3-methoxy-5-pyridin-2-ylethynylpyridine (MPEPy), a selective and high-affinity negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5, to measure receptor density and the radioligand's dissociation constant, which is inversely proportional to affinity. Immunoblotting was also performed, to measure mGluR5 protein expression. Results: The mGluR5 density increased with marginal significance (+16%; P = 0.058) in the prefrontal cortex of FXS patients or carriers compared with matched healthy controls. No significant change in dissociation constant (-4%; P = 0.293) was observed. Immunoblotting found a significant elevation (+32%; P = 0.048) in mGluR5 protein expression. Conclusions: Both mGluR5 binding density and protein expression were increased in the brains of FXS patients or carriers, but only expression was significantly different, which could be because of the small sample size and moderate variability. Another important caveat is that the effects of psychotropic medications on mGluR5 expression are largely unknown. Future in-vivo measurement of mGluR5 with positron emission tomography might characterize the role of this receptor in the pathophysiology of FXS and facilitate trials of mGluR5-oriented treatments for this disorder.

Materials and Methods: [F-18]AV-45 PET was performed in 11 CN, 13 aMCI, and 12 AD subjects to compare the cerebral cortex-to-whole cerebellum standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) of global and individual volumes of interest (VOIs) cerebral cortex. The correlation between global cortical [F-18]AV-45 SUVRs and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores was analyzed. Results: The global cortical [F-18]AV-45 SUVRs were significantly different among the CN (1.08 +/- 0.08), aMCI (1.27 +/- 0.06), and AD groups (1.34 +/- 0.13) (p = 0.0003) with amyloidosis positivity rates of 9%, 62%, and 92% in the three groups respectively. Compared to CN subjects, AD subjects had higher SUVRs in the global cortical, precuneus, frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, and posterior cingulate areas; while aMCI subjects had higher values in the global cortical, precuneus, frontal, occipital and posterior cingulate areas. There were negative correlations of MMSE scores with SUVRs in the global cortical, precuneus, frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, posterior cingulate and anterior cingulate areas on a combined subject pool of the three groups after age and education attainment adjustment. Conclusions: Amyloid deposition occurs relatively early in precuneus, frontal and posterior cingulate in aMCI subjects. Higher [F-18]AV-45 accumulation is present in parietal, occipital and temporal gyri in AD subjects compared to the aMCI group. Significant correlation between MMSE scores and [F-18]AV-45 SUVRs can be observed among CN, aMCI and AD subjects.

Influence of vestibular input on spatial and nonspatial memory and on hippocampal NMDA receptors	HIPPOCAMPUS			English	Article						learning; labyrinthectomy; rat; object recognition; magnetic resonance imaging	LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; RADIAL-ARM MAZE; WATER MAZE; OBJECT RECOGNITION; FORAGING TASK; DENTATE GYRUS; IN-VIVO; RATS; DEAFFERENTATION	It has recently been shown that a lack of vestibular sensory information decreases spatial memory performance and induces biochemical changes in the hippocampus in rodents. After vestibular neurectomy, patients display spatial memory deficit and hippocampal atrophy. Our objectives were to explore: (a) spatial (Y maze, radial-arm maze), and non-spatial (object recognition) memory performance, (b) modulation of NMDA receptors within the hippocampus using radioligand binding, and (c) hippocampal atrophy, using MRI, in a rat model of bilateral labyrinthectomy realized in two operations. Chemical vestibular lesions (VLs) were induced in 24 animals by transtympanic injections of sodium arsanilate (30 mg/0.1 ml/ear), one side being lesioned 3 weeks after the other. The control group received transtympanic saline solution (0.1 ml/ear) (n = 24). Spatial memory performance (Y maze and radial maze) decreased after VL. Conversely, non-spatial memory performance (object recognition) was not affected by VL. No hippocampal atrophy was observed with MRI, but density of NMDA receptors were increased in the hippocampus after VL. These findings show that the lack of vestibular information induced specific deficits in spatial memory. Additionally, quantitative autoradiographic data suggest the involvement of the glutamatergic system in spatial memory processes related to vestibular information. When studying spatial memory performances in the presence of vestibular syndrome, two-step labyrinthectomy is a suitable procedure for distinguishing between the roles of the specific components of vestibular input loss and those of impaired locomotor activity.

First, the synthesis of [C-11]1 was achieved by reacting 5,6-diaminouracil (2) with C-11-labeled phosgene ([C-11]COCl2). The radiochemical yield of [C-11]1 was 37 +/- 7% (decay-corrected based on [C-11]COCl2) with specific radioactivities of 96-152 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis (n = 6). The average time of radiosynthesis from the end of bombardment, including formulation, was about 30 min with >98% radiochemical purity. Second, the synthetic approach to [C-11]1 was optimized using 5,6-diaminouracil sulfate (3) with [C-11]COCl2 in the presence of 1,8-bis(dimethylamino) naphthalene. [C-11]1 was synthesized in 36 +/- 6% radiochemical yield, 89-142 GBq/mu mol of specific radioactivities, and 98% radiochemical purity by this method (n = 5). This allowed the synthesis of [C-11]1 to be carried out repeatedly and the radiochemical yield, specific radioactivities, average time of synthesis, and radiochemical purity of [C-11]1 were similar to those obtained using 2. PET studies in rats showed large differences in the accumulation of radioligand in the limbs under normal and hyperuricemic conditions. Thus, an efficient and convenient automated synthesis of [C-11]1 has been developed, and preliminary PET evaluation of [C-11]1 confirmed the increased accumulation of radioactivity in the limbs of a rat model of hyperuricemia.

Noninvasive monitoring of the activation of HSCs has been challenging due to the lack of specific receptors or motifs on the cells. The present study provides the evidence that integrin alpha v beta 3 expressed on HSCs is a biomarker reflecting the activation of HSCs. Solid-phase synthesis of cRGDyK (Arg-Gly-Asp-DTyr-Lys) peptide and FAM-conjugated peptide were employed for binding to integrin alpha v beta 3. The increased expression of integrin alpha v and in at mRNA and protein levels was detected during HSC activation. The affinity of cRGDyK to integrin alpha v beta 3 was examined by both radioligand binding assay and FAM-conjugated peptide binding measurements. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed a less dramatic, but significant increase in alpha v and beta 3 integrin mRNA and protein expression following activation of rat HSCs. Radioiodinated cRGDyK binds to both purified and membrane-bound integrin alpha v beta 3 with high affinity in a dissociable manner. FAM-conjugated cRGDyK was coupled to activated HSCs in a time- and dose-dependent, receptor-mediated manner. Activated HSCs express sufficient number of integrin alpha v beta 3 receptor. cRGDyK peptide binds to both purified and membrane-bound integrin alpha v beta 3 with high affinity in a reversible fashion. Thus, the cRGDyK peptide represented a new agent potentially useful for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Agonists and Antagonists Bind to an A-A Interface in the Heteromeric 5-HT<sub>3</sub>AB Receptor	BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							SINGLE-CHANNEL CONDUCTANCE; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; 5-HT3 RECEPTOR; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE TYPE-3; MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR; SUBUNIT; SITE; REVEALS	The 5-HT3 receptor is a member of the Cys-loop family of transmitter receptors. It can function as a homopentamer (5-HT3A-only subunits) or as a heteropentamer. The 5-HT(3)AB receptor is the best characterized heteropentamer. This receptor differs from a homopentamer in its kinetics, voltage dependence, and single-channel conductance, but its pharmacology is similar. To understand the contribution of the 5-HT3B subunit to the binding site, we created homology models of 5-HT(3)AB receptors and docked 5-HT and granisetron into AB, BA, and BB interfaces. To test whether ligands bind in any or all of these interfaces, we mutated amino acids that are important for agonist and antagonist binding in the 5-HT3A subunit to their corresponding residues in the 5-HT3B subunit and vice versa. Changes in [H-3]granisetron binding affinity (K-d) and 5-HT EC50 were determined using receptors expressed in HEK-293 cells and Xenopus oocytes, respectively. For all A-to-B mutant receptors, except T181N, antagonist binding was altered or eliminated. Functional studies revealed that either the receptors were nonfunctional or the EC50 values were increased. In B-to-A mutant receptors there were no changes in K-d, although EC50 values and Hill slopes, except for N170T mutant receptors, were similar to those for 5-HT(3)A receptors. Thus, the experimental data do not support a contribution of the 5-HT3B subunit to the binding pocket, and we conclude that both 5-HT and granisetron bind to an AA binding site in the heteromeric 5-HT(3)AB receptor.

The goal of this study was to evaluate the two carbon-11-labeled alpha 7 nAChR agonists [C-11]A-582941 and [C-11]A-844606 for their potential as novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. Methodology/Principal Findings: The two tracers were synthesized by methylation of the corresponding desmethyl precursors using [C-11] methyl triflate. Effects of receptor blockade in mice were determined by coinjection of either tracer along with a carrier or an excess amount of a selective alpha 7 nAChR agonist (SSR180711). Metabolic stability was investigated using radio-HPLC. Dynamic PET scans were performed in conscious monkeys with/without SSR180711-treatment. [C-11]A-582941 and [C-11]A-844606 showed high uptake in the mouse brain. Most radioactive compounds in the brain were detected as an unchanged form. However, regional selectivity and selective receptor blockade were not clearly observed for either compound in the mouse brain. On the other hand, the total distribution volume of [C-11]A-582941 and [C-11]A-844606 was high in the hippocampus and thalamus but low in the cerebellum in the conscious monkey brain, and reduced by pretreatment with SSR180711. Conclusions/Significance: A nonhuman primate study suggests that [C-11]A-582941 and [C-11]A-844606 would be potential PET ligands for imaging alpha 7 nAChRs in the human brain.

The diffuse nature of these declines suggests the possibility that cocaine use might cause a loss of dopamine neurons in humans. Previous rodent studies have not detected cocaine-induced dopamine cell damage. The present experiment involved counting midbrain dopamine neurons utilizing both melanin and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity. Well-preserved blocks ranging from + 38 torn obex to +45 mm obex were examined in 10 cocaine users and 9 controls. Sections were also examined for signs of acute pathological injury by counting activated macrophages and microglia. Melanized cells at six midbrain levels were significantly reduced in cocaine users by both drug exposures. The estimated total number of melanized dopamine cells in the anterior midbrain was significantly reduced in cocaine users by 16%. Results with tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity were less conclusive because of variability in staining. Both activated macrophages and activated microglia were significantly increased among cocaine users. Cocaine exposure may have neurotoxic effects on dopamine neurons in humans. The infiltration of phagocytic cells suggests that the lower number of dopamine cells found in cocaine users was a relatively recent effect. The loss of dopamine cells could contribute to and intensify cocaine dependence, as well as anhedonic and depressive symptoms, in some cocaine users. Further efforts at clarifying the pathophysiological mechanisms involved may help explain treatment refractoriness, and identify targets for therapeutic intervention.

Application of the functionalized congener approach to dendrimer-based signaling agents acting through A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine receptors	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	8th International Symposium on Adenosine and Adenine Nucleotides	2006	Ferrara, ITALY			A(2A) adenosine receptors; Dendrimers; Functionalized congeners; G protein-coupled receptors.; Antithrombotic; Nanotechnology	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; POLYAMIDOAMINE DENDRIMERS; BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; INTERNATIONAL UNION; PAMAM DENDRIMERS; IN-VITRO; CYTOTOXICITY; BIODISTRIBUTION; NOMENCLATURE; PHARMACOLOGY	As a continued effort to develop multivalent ligands to enhance the pharmacological effects of monomeric drugs, DITC-APEC, a chemically reactive nucleoside A(2A) adenosine receptor (AR) agonist, was employed to derivatize the surface of third-generation (G3) polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers. The resulting conjugates carried multiple copies of the agonist attached through a thiourea linkage and differed in the number of attachments and in the presence of a fluorophore or additional surface modification. Computer modeling studies suggested that these DITC-APEC-loaded dendrimers extended the overall diameter of the previously reported PAMAM-CGS21680 dendrimer derivatives (Kim et al., Bioconjugate Chem 2008 19:406-411) by ca. 20 A..., potentially increasing the conformational flexibility of the appended ligands to achieve optimal geometry for efficient binding at A(2A) ARs. Increased affinity and selectivity in binding in comparison to the CGS21680 conjugate were envisioned, due to the presence of an extended linker, i.e., a dithioureylenephenyl functionality. In vitro radioligand competition experiments showed effective binding of these PAMAM-DITC-APEC dendrimer conjugates at the human A(2A) and A(3) ARs with submicromolar K (i) values and selectivity in comparison to the human A(1) AR. Furthermore, these nucleoside-loaded dendrimers exhibited an A(2A) AR-mediated inhibitory effect on ADP-induced aggregation of human platelets. The present study demonstrates the potential of applying the functionalized congener concept to engineer dendrimer-based multivalent ligands for G protein-coupled receptors.

Differential Potencies of Naturally Occurring Regioisomers of Nitrolinoleic Acid in PPARγ Activation	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							NITRATED FATTY-ACIDS; NITRIC-OXIDE; RECEPTOR-GAMMA; RESISTANCE; TRANSDUCTION; EXPRESSION; LIGAND; LIPIDS; MRP1	Previous studies demonstrated that the naturally occurring electrophile and PPAR gamma ligand, nitrolinoleic acid (NO2-LA), exists as a mixture of four regioisomers [Alexander, R. L., et al. (2006) Biochemistry 45,7889-7896]. We hypothesized that these alternative isomers have distinct bioactivities; therefore, to determine if the regioisomers are quantitatively or qualitatively different with respect to PPAR gamma activation, NO2-LA was separated into three fractions which were identified by NMR (13-NO2-LA, 12-NO2-LA, and a mixture of 9- and 10-NO2-LA) and characterized for PPAR gamma interactions. A competition radioligand binding assay showed that all three NO2-LA fractions had similar binding affinities for PPAR gamma (IC50 = 0.41-0.60 mu M) that were comparable to that of the pharmaceutical ligand, rosiglitazone (IC50 = 0.25 mu M). However, when PPAR gamma-dependent transcription activation was examined, there were significant differences observed among the NO2-LA fractions. Each isomer behaved as a partial agonist in this reporter gene assay; however, the 12-NO2 derivative was the most potent with respect to maximum activation of PPAR gamma and an EC50 of 0.045 mu M (compare with the rosiglitazone EC50 of 0.067 mu M), while the 13-NO2 and 9- and 10-NO2 derivatives were considerably less effective with EC50 values of 0.41-0.62 mu M. We conclude that the regioisomers of NO2-LA are not functionally equivalent. The 12-NO2 derivative appears to be the most potent in PPAR gamma-dependent transcription activation, whereas the weaker PPAR gamma agonists, 13-NO2 and 9- and 10-NO2, may be relatively more important in signaling via other, PPAR gamma-independent pathways in which this family of nitrolipid electrophiles is implicated.

We have used a yoked-box procedure to simultaneously test rats in triads, one rat that actively self-administered cocaine (CONT), while the other two received yoked injections of either cocaine (NON-CONT) or saline (SALINE). The brains in each triad were removed and processed for quantitative autoradiography immediately after the last session of cocaine self-ad ministration (Day 0), or after 1, 5, or 10 days of extinction, and excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) and dopamine transporter (DAT) binding was examined. When compared to NON-CONT and SALINE animals, binding of radioligand to EAATs was significantly lower in the hippocampal CA1 field and the cerebellar cortex of CONT rats on Day 0, although it was significantly higher after 1 day of extinction in the infralimbic cortex. No differences in EAAT binding were observed after 5 or 10 days of extinction in any of the brain regions analyzed. in contrast and at all the time points of extinction, binding to DAT was significantly enhanced in CONT animals when compared to SALINE and NON-CONT rats in different forebrain and mesencephalic regions, including the nucleus accumbens, ventral tegmental area or caudate putamen. These results suggest that changes in protein transporter binding after cocaine self-administration and extinction are transient for EAAT while they are more enduring for DAT, and that they depend on the type of access to cocaine.

However, there are currently no suitable positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for imaging a7 nAChRs in the intact human brain. Here we report the novel PET radioligand [C-11] CHIBA-1001 for in vivo imaging of alpha 7 nAChRs in the non-human primate brain. Methodology/Principal Findings: A receptor binding assay showed that CHIBA-1001 was a highly selective ligand at alpha 7 nAChRs. Using conscious monkeys, we found that the distribution of radioactivity in the monkey brain after intravenous administration of [C-11] CHIBA-1001 was consistent with the regional distribution of alpha 7 nAChRs in the monkey brain. The distribution of radioactivity in the brain regions after intravenous administration of [C-11] CHIBA-1001 was blocked by pretreatment with the selective alpha 7 nAChR agonist SSR180711 (5.0 g/kg). However, the distribution of [C-11] CHIBA-1001 was not altered by pretreatment with the selective alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR agonist A85380 (1.0 mg/kg). Interestingly, the binding of [C-11]CHIBA-1001 in the frontal cortex of the monkey brain was significantly decreased by subchronic administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist phencyclidine (0.3 mg/kg, twice a day for 13 days); which is a non-human primate model of schizophrenia. Conclusions/Significance: The present findings suggest that [C-11]CHIBA-1001 could be a novel useful PET ligand for in vivo study of the receptor occupancy and pathophysiology of alpha 7 nAChRs in the intact brain of patients with neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.

Comparative analysis of visual and semi-quantitative assessment of striatal [<SUP>123</SUP>I]FP-CIT-SPET binding in Parkinson's disease	NEUROLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						[I-123]FP-CIT SPET; Parkinson's disease; visual assessment; disease progression; dopamine transporter; UPDRS	DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER BINDING; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SPECT; I-123-FP-CIT; PROGRESSION; DIAGNOSIS; SEVERITY; LIGAND; CIT	We used qualitative visual assessment and semiquantitative measures of striatal DAT binding using [I-123]FP-CIT-SPET in 85 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We compared these two assessments and their correlation with PD clinical progression. SPET imaging was visually classified by a nuclear medicine physician as normal or abnormal pattern grade I, II and III, in relation to a different degree of radioligand reduction uptake. Nineteen patients presented abnormal grade I (group 1), 53 grade II (group 2) and 13 grade III (group 3). The UPDRS III motor score, the H-Y score, the rigidity and bradykinesia subscores were significantly different among the three groups. Post hoc analysis showed that all values of these clinical parameters were higher in group 3 than in 2 and 1. All clinical indices were also significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. This means that groups 3 and 2 were clinically more severely affected. No significant differences among the 3 groups were observed for age or duration of disease. Values of the mean striatum uptake were also significantly different among the three groups. Post hoc analysis revealed significantly lower values of the mean striatum uptake in group 3 with respect to groups 2 and 1; values were also significantly lower in group 2 than in group 1. We conclude that our findings of good consistency between visual and semi-quantitative assessment may help simplify the evaluation of striatal DAT binding in PD in a clinical routine setting.

The latter is regulated by systemic factors acting independently from angiotensin II concentration. Objective: To test the hypothesis that AT(1)R density at the onset of MI determines post-MI ventricular remodelling. Methods: In 48 patients with first acute MI who did not undergo reperfusion therapy, angiotensin AT(1)R density on blood platelets (reflecting cardiovascular AT(1)R density) was assessed 13 +/- 5 h after the onset of MI, using radioligand binding assay. Left ventricular end-systolic (LVESVI) and end-diastolic volume indices (LVEDVI) and ejection fraction (EF) were assessed by two-dimensional echocardiography as measures of ventricular remodelling. Results: Predischarge LVESVI and LVEDVI positively and EF negatively correlated with AT(1)R density. Patients with AT, R density below median had significantly lower LVESVI (33.2 +/- 2.4 mL/m(2)), LVEDVI (70.0 +/- 2.8 mL/m(2)) and higher EF (52.8 +/- 2.3%) than patients with AT(1)R density above median (LVESVI=44.9 +/- 2.6, LVEDVI=81.3 +/- 3.9 mL/m(2) and EF=44.9 +/- 2.6%, all p < 0.01). In multivariate analysis, only AT(1)R density and infarct size were independent predictors of early post-MI ventricular dilation. Conclusions: High density of AT(1)R at the onset of MI is a predictor of early left ventricular remodelling. (c) 2005 European Society of Cardiology. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To address this issue, we used the M-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical class A GPCR, as a model system, employing a recently developed disulfide cross-linking strategy that allows the formation of disulfide bonds using Cys-substituted mutant M-3 muscarinic receptors present in their native membrane environment. In the present study, we generated and analyzed 30 double Cys mutant M-3 receptors, all of which contained one Cys substitution within the C-terminal portion of transmembrane domain (TM) VII (Val-541 to Ser-546) and another one within the C-terminal segment of TM I (Val-88 to Phe-92). Following their transient expression in COS-7 cells, all mutant receptors were initially characterized in radioligand binding and second messenger assays (carbachol-induced stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis). This analysis showed that all 30 double Cys mutant M-3 receptors were able to bind muscarinic ligands with high affinity and retained the ability to stimulate G proteins with high efficacy. In situ disulfide cross-linking experiments revealed that the muscarinic agonist, carbachol, promoted the formation of cross-links between specific Cys pairs. The observed pattern of disulfide cross-links, together with receptor modeling studies, strongly suggested that M-3 receptor activation induces a major rotational movement of the C-terminal portion of TM VII and increases the proximity of the cytoplasmic ends of TM I and VII. These findings should be of relevance for other family A GPCRs.

This study included 29 postmenopausal metastatic breast cancer patients. Plasma TGF-beta 1 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Estrogen and progesterone receptors were assayed by radioligand binding, in accordance with the recommendation of the EORTC. Concentrations of 17-beta estradiol were determined by using ELISA-microwell method (DIALAB). Overall survival was followed for 24 months for each individual patient. Stratification of the patients by ER/PR status showed that 14 patients with estrogen receptor-negative, progesterone receptor-negative carcinomas displayed a statistically significant increase in plasma TGF-beta 1 levels when compared to plasma TGF-beta 1 levels of 6 patients with ER-positive, PR-positive carcinomas (P=0.04). In this study, 7 out of 14 patients with negative receptors' status had no plasma TGF-beta 1 values overlapping with patients having positive receptors' status. The TGF-beta 1 cut-off value was defined as the highest plasma TGF-beta 1 level of ER-positive, PR-positive patients: 3.28 ng/ml. This plasma TGF-beta 1 cut-off value defined low-risk subgroup of 19 patients (! 3.28 ng/ml) and high-risk subgroup of 10 patients (>3.28 ng/ml) (P=0.047). Plasma TGF-beta 1-related survival was independent of the classical prognostic factors of metastatic breast cancer. Accordingly, a clinical significance of elevated plasma TGF-beta 1 levels may be suggested.

To examine the role of these residues (R507 and E727 in the GluR-D subunit) in the discrimination between agonists and antagonists, we analyzed the ligand-binding properties of homomeric GluR-D and its soluble ligand-binding domain with mutations at these positions. Filter-binding assays using [(3) H]AMPA, an agonist, and [(3) H]Ro 48-8587, a high-affinity antagonist, as radioligands revealed that even a conservative mutation at R507 (R507K) resulted in the complete loss of both agonist and antagonist binding. In contrast, a negative charge at position 727 was necessary for agonist binding, whereas the isosteric mutation, E727Q, abolished all agonist binding but retained high-affinity binding for [(3) H]Ro 48-8587, displaceable by 7,8-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. Competition binding studies with antagonists representing different structural classes in combination with ligand docking experiments suggest that the role of E727 is antagonist-specific, ranging from no interaction to weak electrostatic interactions involving indirect and direct hydrogen bonding with the antagonist molecule. These results underline the importance of ion pair interaction with E727 for agonist activity and suggest that an interaction with R507, but not with E727, is essential for antagonist binding.

While two of the bisacythydrazines (coded as RH-5992 and RH-2485) are predominantly toxic to lepidopteran pests, RH-5849, which has not been commercialized, has a broader spectrum of toxicity. We have carried out toxicity bioassays with last (4th) instar Chironomus tentans L. larvae, radioligand binding assays using bacterial fusion proteins of C. tentans ecdysone receptor and ultraspiracle (CtEcR, CtUSP), and C. tentans imaginal disc development assays to compare the relative potencies of the three bisacythydrazine compounds as well as of 20-hydroxyecdysone (20E). In all three assays, the potency of the three bisacylhydrazines was in the order RH-2485>RH-5992>RH-5849. While in toxicity assays 20E was ineffective, most likely due to rapid metabolism, it was more potent than R-H-5849 but less so than RH-5992 and RH-2485 in imaginal disc assays. In summary, we compared the potencies of the ecdysone agonists for C. tentans at three levels: whole organism, imaginal discs and the receptor level, and our results indicate that the increased toxicity of the nonsteroidal ecdysone agonists for C. tentans has a high correlation to the affinity of these compounds for CtEcR/CtUSP bacterially expressed proteins. Our results, though, do not exclude reasons of metabolic stability of the compounds in C. tentans, which we have not investigated in this report. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Its affinity for human dopamine and 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors has been reported previously (Kongsamut et al. 1996). This report presents the affinity of iloperidone for a largely extended number of human neurotransmitter receptors. In a few instances human receptors were not available and receptor studies were performed on tissues from laboratory animals. The present data, supplemented with those of Kongsamut et al. (1996), indicate that iloperidone displays high affinity (K-1 < 10 nM)for norepinephrine <alpha>(1)-adrenoceptors, dopamine D-3 and scrotonin 5-HT2A receptors. Intermediate affinity (10-100 nM) was found for norepinephrine alpha (2C)-adrenoceptors, dopamine D-2A and D-4 receptors and serotonin 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT2C and 5-HT6 receptors. The affinity for till other receptors was below 100 nM, including norepinephrine alpha (1A), alpha (2B), beta (1), and beta (2), muscarine M-1-M-5, histamine H-1, dopamine D-1 and D-5, CCKA and CCKB, 5-HT7, dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. Thus, iloperidone targets a selective set of dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin receptor subtypes. The affinity for this particular set of receptors indicates that iloperidone has the potential to be a broad spectrum antipsychotic, with efficacy against positive, negative, depressive and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and a low propensity to induce side effects.

Interpretations are, however, limited by effects of compensatory regulation and atrophy. Studies of the vesicular monoamine transporter type-2 (V-VMAT2) and of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in experimental animals indicate that they are robust markers of presynaptic integrity and are not subject to regulation. We measured dopamine and acetylcholine vesicular transporters to characterize the selectivity of degeneration in HD striatum. Brains were obtained at autopsy from four HD patients and five controls. Autoradiography was used to quantify radioligand binding to VMAT2, VAChT, the dopamine plasmalemmal transporter (DAT), benzodiazepine (BZ) binding sites, and D2-type dopamine receptors. The activity of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) was determined as an additional marker of cholinergic neurons. Autoradiograms were analyzed by video-assisted densitometry and assessment of atrophy was made from regional structural areas in the coronal projection. Striatal VMAT2, DAT, and VAChT concentrations were unchanged or increased, while D2 and BZ binding and ChAT activity were decreased in HD. After atrophy correction, all striatal binding sites were decreased. However, the decrease in ChAT activity was 3-fold greater than that of VAChT binding. In addition to degeneration of striatal projection neurons, there are losses of extrinsic nigrostriatal projections and of striatal cholinergic interneurons in HD on the basis of vesicular transporter measures. There is also markedly reduced expression of ChAT by surviving cholinergic striatal interneurons. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine the dosage, safety profile and therapeutic efficacy of Y-90-DOTATOC in patients with cancers expressing somatostatin receptors. We recruited 30 patients with histologically confirmed cancer. The main inclusion criterion was the presence of somatostatin receptors as documented by In-111-DOTATOC scintigraphy, 90Y-DOTATOC was injected intravenously using a horizontal protocol: patients received equivalent-activity doses in each of three cycles over 6 months. The first six patients received 1.11 GBq per cycle and the four successive groups of six patients received doses increasing in 0.37-GBq steps. Toxicity was evaluated according to WHO criteria. No patient had acute or delayed adverse reactions up to 2.59 GBq Y-90-DOTATOC per cycle (total 7.77 GBq). After a total dose of 3.33 GBq, one patient developed grade II renal toxicity 6 months later. The maximum tolerated dose per cycle has not yet been reached, although transient lymphocytopenia has been observed. Total injectable activity is limited by the fact that the maximum dose tolerated by the kidneys has been estimated at 20-25 Gy. Complete or partial tumour mass reduction occurred in 23% of patients; 64% had stable and 13% progressive disease. It is concluded that high activities of Y-90-DOTATOC can be administered with a low risk of myelotoxicity, although the cumulative radiation dose to the kidneys is a limiting factor and requires careful evaluation, Objective therapeutic responses have been observed.

In this study, we have examined the interaction of local anaesthetics (lidocaine, bupivacaine and its optical isomers, tetracaine, procaine and prilocaine) with recombinant mu-, kappa-, and F-opioid receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-mu, kappa, and delta, respectively). Lidocaine produced a concentration-dependent displacement of radiolabelled opioid antagonist [H-3]diprenorphine ([H-3]DPN) binding with the following rank order of inhibitor constant (Ki): kappa (210 muM) > mu (552 muM) > delta (1810 muM). Procaine, prilocaine, tetracaine and bupivacaine also displaced [H-3]DPN binding in CHO- mu with K-i values of 244, 204, 43 and 161 muM respectively. Lidocaine produced a concentration-dependent and naloxone-insensitive inhibition of cAMP formation in all cell lines including untransfected cells. Concentration producing 50% inhibition of maximum was mu, 1.32 mM; kappa-, 2.41 mM; delta, 1.27 mM; untransfected, 2.78 mM. When lidocaine (300 muM) was co-incubated with spiradoline (kappa -selective) and [D-Ala(2), MePhe(4), Gly(ol)(5)] enkephalin (DAMGO mu -selective) in CHO-kappa and mu cells we did not observe an additive interaction for cAMP formation. In contrast, there was an apparent inhibitory action of the combination at the kappa receptor. This study suggests that clinical concentrations of local anaesthetics interact with mu and kappa but not delta opioid receptors. As there was no synergism between local anaesthetics and opioids we suggest that the interaction of these agents in the clinical setting does not occur at the cellular level.

J	Thibault, G				Thibault, G			Sodium dodecyl sulfate-stable complexes of echistatin and RGD-dependent integrins: A novel approach to study integrins	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							VITRONECTIN RECEPTOR; CARDIAC FIBROBLASTS; VIPER VENOMS; DISINTEGRINS; BINDING; ALPHA(IIB)BETA(3); PROTEINS; SEQUENCE; FAMILY	This study shows that disintegrins, echistatin as a model, can be used as a radiolabeled probe to simultaneously detect the presence of individual RGD-dependent integrins on cardiac fibroblasts. Binding of I-125-echistatin to fibroblasts was proportional to cell number, time dependent, reversible, saturable, specific, and membrane bound. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiograms revealed that I-125-echistatin was associated with three radioactive protein bands of 180, 210, and 220 kDa that were identified by RGD affinity chromatography, immunoblotting, and immunoneutralization as alpha(v)beta(3), alpha(3)alpha(1)/alpha(5)beta(1)/alpha(v)beta(1), and alpha(8)beta(1) heterodimeric integrins, respectively. These results suggest that echistatin binds to RGD-dependent integrins, forming SDS-stable complexes in the absence of chemical cross-linkers, reducing conditions and heating. As assessed by radioligand-binding filtration, disintegrins displayed binding characteristics with an IC50 ranging from 0.044 to 1.1 nM, but with slope factors lower than 1, indicating the presence of several binding sites. Resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to reveal echistatin-integrin complexes, disintegrins and RGD peptides displayed different binding affinities to individual RGD-dependent integrins present on cardiac fibroblasts. Elegantin and flavostatin demonstrated the highest affinity toward integrins, whereas flavoridin and acPen-RGDC had a greater specificity toward alpha(v)beta(3)-integrin. In summary, echistatin forms SDS-stable complexes with RGD-dependent integrins. This model offers a novel way to visualize RGD-dependent integrins, to investigate their activation state, and to determine the integrin specificity of RGD peptides.

Several recent investigations suggest that P-glycoprotein contains multiple drug binding sites rather than a single site of broad substrate specificity. In the present study, radioligand-binding techniques were used to directly characterize drug interaction sites on P-glycoprotein and how these multiple sites interact. The drugs used were classified as either 1) substrates, which are known to be transported by P-glycoprotein (e.g., vinblastine) or 2) modulators, which alter P-glycoprotein function but are not themselves transported by the protein (e.g., XR9576). Drug interactions with P-glycoprotein were either competitive, at a common site, or noncompetitive, and therefore at distinct sites. Based on these data, we can assign a minimum of four drug binding sites on P-glycoprotein. These sites fall into two categories: transport, at which translocation of drug across the membrane can occur, and regulatory sites, which modify P-glycoprotein function. Intriguingly, however, some modulators interact with P-glycoprotein at a transport site rather than a regulatory site. The pharmacological data also demonstrate that both transport and regulatory sites are able to switch between high- and low-affinity conformations. The multiple sites on P-glycoprotein display complex allosteric interactions through which interaction of drug at one site switches other sites between high- or low-affinity conformations. The data are discussed in terms of a model for the mechanism of transport by P-glycoprotein.

We investigated the regulation of both B1 and B2 receptors in human embryonic lung fibroblasts (HEL 299) by the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta). TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta both induced a rapid and transient increase in B1 and B2 receptor mRNA expression that was maximal by 2 h, accompanied by an increase in B1 and B2 receptor protein, as measured by radioligand binding assay with [H-3]des-Arg(10)-kallidin, and [H-3]bradykinin, respectively. The induced B1 receptors were functionally coupled, because the B1 agonist, des-Arg(10)-kallidin, induced an increase in arachidonic acid release in TNF-alpha-stimulated cells but not in control cells. The induction of B1 and the up-regulation of B2 receptors by TNF-alpha was partly mediated through activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and that of B2 receptor by protein kinase A. TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta regulation of both B1 and B2 receptors was inhibited by dexamethasone. When compared with vehicle-treated cells, dexamethasone increased the rate of decline of both B1 and B2 receptor mRNAs. Nuclear run-on experiments demonstrate that the induction of B1 and the up-regulation of B2 receptors as well as the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone are entirely mediated through post-transcriptional mechanisms.

Abnormal calcium regulation appears to be a key factor in the pathophysiology of heart failure, but the cellular mechanisms contributing to changes in calcium fluxes have not been clearly defined. Isolated ventricular myocytes from non-failing and failing hearts were therefore used to determine whether the whole heart and ventricular muscle contractile dysfunctions were realized at the single cell level. Whole cell. current- and voltage-clamp techniques were used to evaluate action potential configurations and L-type calcium currents, respectively. Intracellular calcium transients were evaluated in isolated myocytes with fura-2 and in isolated left ventricular muscles using aequorin. Action potential durations were prolonged in failing myocytes. which correspond to slowed cytosolic calcium clearing. Calcium current-voltage relationships were normal in failing myocytes; preliminary evidence suggests that depressed transient outward potassium currents contribute to prolonged action potential durations. The number of calcium channels (as measured by radioligand binding) were also similar in non-failing and failing hearts. Isolated ventricular muscles from failing hearts had enhanced inotropic responses, in a dose-dependent fashion, to a calcium channel agonist (Bay K 8644). These data suggest that changes in intracellular calcium mobilization kinetics and longer calcium-myofilament interaction may be able to compensate for contractile failure. We conclude that the relationship between calcium current density and sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium release is a dynamic process that may be altered in the setting of heart failure at higher contraction rates.

Methods.-Paracetamol was administered daily to adult male Wistar rats for a period of 15 or 30 days. Analgesic efficacy was measured by the tail flick test. After completion of the treatment protocol, the rats were humanely killed, and the frontal cortex and brain stem were isolated. Characteristics of the specific binding of the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor and the serotonin transporter were studied using a radioligand binding technique, Platelet serotonin was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Results.-Chronic paracetamol administration resulted in a significant decrease in the maximum number of 5-MT2A binding sites and an increase in the maximum number of 5-HT transporter binding sites in frontal cortical membrane (P<.001). Changes in the central 5-HT system were associated with a rise in platelet 5-HT levels. The degree of receptor downregulation, as well as transporter upregulation, became less evident after more prolonged drug administration. Readaptation of serotonin receptors and transporters coincided with the decrease in the analgesic efficacy of paracetamol, as well as a fall in platelet 5-HT levels. Conclusions.-These findings provide further evidence in support of an involvement of the 5-HT system in the antinociceptive activity of simple nonnarcotic analgesics. Plasticity of this neurotransmitter system after chronic analgesic exposure may lead to the loss of analgesic efficacy and, in its more extreme form, may produce analgesic-related painful conditions, for example, analgesic abuse headache.

This study aims to map the research landscape through bibliometric analysis and provide a brief overview for the future of the GIST field. Methods: We searched the Web of Science Core Collection without publication data restrictions for GISTs and performed a bibliometric analysis with CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. Results: In sum, 5,911 of 13,776 records were included, and these studies were published in 948 journals and written by 24,965 authors from 4,633 institutions in 100 countries. Referring to published reviews and biblio-metric analysis, we classified the future trends in four groups. In epidemiological study, precise incidence and clinicopathological features in different regions and races might become potential hotspots. Novel therapy, such as drugs, modified strategies, radioligand therapy, was persistent hotspots in GIST fields, and ctDNA-guided diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment might meet future clinical needs. The debate over serosa surgery vs. mucosa surgery will remain active for a long time in GIST surgery, and function reserve surgery, biology-based surgery will play an important role in future. Moreover, rare GIST type, like NF-1-associated GIST, Carney tri-ads and SDH mutant GIST, need more studies in pathogenesis and genetic mutation to provide appropriate treatment for this orphan GIST patients.Conclusions: Potential hotspots in future GIST trends might involve epidemiology, agents, resection therapy and rare type GIST, moreover, researchers could pay more attention in these four fields.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to measure lesion load and brain volume, and quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) was used to detect iron rim lesions. These evaluations were repeated after 1 year of inclusion. Twelve age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects were imaged for comparison.Results Half of the patients had iron rim lesions. In TSPO-PET, the proportion of active voxels indicating innate immune cell activation was slightly greater amongst patients compared with healthy individuals (7.7% vs. 5.4%, p = 0.033). The mean distribution volume ratio of [C-11]PK11195 was not significantly different in the normal-appearing white matter or thalamus amongst patients versus controls. Amongst the treated patients, no significant alteration was observed in positron emission tomography distribution volume ratio, the proportion of active voxels, the number of iron-rim-positive lesions, lesion load or brain volume during follow-up.Conclusions Compared to controls, treated patients exhibited modest signs of diffuse innate immune cell activity, which was unaltered during follow-up. Lesion-associated smoldering inflammation was negligible at both timepoints. To our knowledge, this is the first study applying both TSPO-PET and QSM-MRI to longitudinally evaluate smoldering inflammation.

Positron Emission Tomography Imaging of Vessel Wall Matrix Metalloproteinase Activity in Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm	CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR IMAGING			English	Article						aortic aneurysm; abdominal; inflammation; matrix metalloproteinases; molecular imaging; positron-emission tomography	ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; CHELATORS	Background:Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a key role in the pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Imaging aortic MMP activity, especially using positron emission tomography to access high sensitivity, quantitative data, could potentially improve AAA risk stratification. Here, we describe the design, synthesis, characterization, and evaluation in murine AAA and human aortic tissue of a first-in-class MMP-targeted positron emission tomography radioligand, Cu-64-RYM2. Methods:The broad spectrum MMP inhibitor, RYM2 was synthetized, and its potency as an MMP inhibitor was evaluated by a competitive inhibition assay. Toxicology studies were performed. Tracer biodistribution was evaluated in a murine model of AAA induced by angiotensin II infusion in Apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Cu-64-RYM2 binding to normal and aneurysmal human aortic tissues was assessed by autoradiography. Results:RYM2 functioned as an MMP inhibitor with nanomolar affinities. Toxicology studies showed no adverse reaction in mice. Upon radiolabeling with Cu-64, the resulting tracer was stable in murine and human blood in vitro. Biodistribution and metabolite analysis in mice showed rapid renal clearance and acceptable in vivo stability. In vivo positron emission tomography/computed tomography in a murine model of AAA showed a specific aortic signal, which correlated with ex vivo measured MMP activity and Cd68 gene expression. Cu-64-RYM2 specifically bound to normal and aneurysmal human aortic tissues in correlation with MMP activity. Conclusions:Cu-64-RYM2 is a first-in-class MMP-targeted positron emission tomography tracer with favorable stability, biodistribution, performance in preclinical AAA, and importantly, specific binding to human tissues. These data set the stage for Cu-64-RYM2-based translational imaging studies of vessel wall MMP activity, and indirectly, inflammation, in AAA.

Hypoxia is a hallmark of tumor environment and is commonly observed in many solid tumors. Non-invasive imaging techniques like positron emission tomography (PET) are at the forefront of detecting and monitoring tissue hypoxia changes in vivo. Results We have developed a novel F-18-labeled radiotracer for hypoxia PET imaging based on cytotoxic agent benznidazole. Radiotracer N-(4-[F-18]fluorobenzyl)-2-(2-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)acetamide ([F-18]FBNA) was synthesized through acylation chemistry with readily available 4-[F-18]fluorobenzyl amine. Radiotracer [F-18]FBNA was obtained in good radiochemical yields (47.4 +/- 5.3%) and high radiochemical purity (> 95%). The total synthesis time was 100 min, including HPLC purification and the molar activity was greater than 40 GBq/mu mol. Radiotracer [F-18]FBNA was stable in saline and mouse serum for 6 h. [F-18]FBNA partition coefficient (logP = 1.05) was found to be more lipophilic than [F-18]EF-5 (logP = 0.75), [F-18]FMISO (logP = 0.4) and [F-18]FAZA (logP = - 0.4). In vitro studies showed that [F-18]FBNA accumulates in gastric cancer cell lines AGS and MKN45 under hypoxic conditions. Conclusions Hence, [F-18]FBNA represents a novel and easy-to-prepare PET radioligand for imaging hypoxia.

We recently developed a PET imaging tracer [F-18]VAT to target VAChT in vivo with high affinity and selectivity. Here we report in vitro characterization of [H-3]VAT, a tritiated counterpart of [F-18]VAT. Using human VAChT-rich cell membrane extracts, a saturated binding curve was obtained for [H-3]VAT with Kd = 6.5 nM and B-max = 22.89 pmol/mg protein. In the [H-3]VAT competition-binding assay with a panel of CNS ligands, binding inhibition of [H-3]VAT was observed using VAChT ligands, the Ki values ranged from 5.41 to 33.3 nM. No inhibition was detected using a panel of other CNS ligands. In vitro [H-3]VAT autoradiography of rat brain sections showed strong signals in the striatum, moderate to high signals in vermis, thalamus, cortex, and hippocampus, and weak signals in cerebellum. Strong [3H]VAT ARG signals were also observed from striatal sections of normal nonhuman primates and human brains. Competitive ARG study with human striatal sections demonstrated strong ARG signals of [3H]VAT in caudate and putamen were blocked significantly by either VAChT ligand TZ659 or (-)-vesamicol, but not by the sigma(1) receptor ligand Yun-122. ARG study also indicated that signal in the striatal sections from PSP human brains was lower than normal human brains. These data provide solid evidence supporting [F-18]VAT as a suitable PET radiotracer for quantitative assessment of VAChT levels in vivo.

However, the determination of the autoimmune status of type 1 diabetes mellitus relies on islet autoantibodies (Abs), as T-cell assay is not routinely carried out. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of combined assay of islet antigen-specific T cells and Abs in type 1 diabetes mellitus patients. Materials and Methods A total of 54 patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and 56 healthy controls were enrolled. Abs against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), islet antigen-2 and zinc transporter 8 were detected by radioligand assay. Interferon-gamma-secreting T cells responding to glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and C-peptide (CP) were measured by enzyme-linked immunospot. Results The positive rate for T-cell responses was significantly higher in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus than that in controls (P < 0.001). The combined positive rate of Abs and T-cell assay was significantly higher than that of Abs assay alone (85.2% vs 64.8%, P = 0.015). A significant difference in fasting CP level was found between the T+ and T- groups (0.07 +/- 0.05 vs 0.11 +/- 0.09 nmol/L, P = 0.033). Furthermore, levels of fasting CP and postprandial CP were both lower in the Ab(-)T(+) group than the Ab(-)T(-) group (fasting CP 0.06 +/- 0.05 vs 0.16 +/- 0.12 nmol/L, P = 0.041; postprandial CP 0.12 +/- 0.13 vs 0.27 +/- 0.12 nmol/L, P = 0.024). Conclusions Enzyme-linked immunospot assays in combination with Abs detection could improve the diagnostic sensitivity of autoimmune diabetes.

The development of B1 antagonists peaked in recent years but almost all promising molecules failed in clinical trials. Little is known about these molecules' mechanisms of action and additional information will be necessary to exploit the potential of the B1 receptor. With the aim of contributing to the available knowledge of the pharmacology of B1 receptors, we designed and characterized a novel class of allosteric non-peptidic inhibitors with peculiar binding characteristics. Here, we report the binding mode analysis and pharmacological characterization of a new allosteric B1 antagonist, DFL20656. We analyzed the binding of DFL20656 by single point mutagenesis and radioligand binding assays and we further characterized its pharmacology in terms of IC50, B1 receptor internalization and in vivo activity in comparison with different known B1 antagonists. We highlighted how different binding modes of DFL20656 and a Merck compound (compound 14) within the same molecular pocket can affect the biological and pharmacological properties of B1 inhibitors. DFL20656, by its peculiar binding mode, involving tight interactions with N114, efficiently induced B1 receptor internalization and evoked a long-lasting effect in an in vivo model of neuropathic pain. The pharmacological characterization of different B1 antagonists highlighted the effects of their binding modes on activity, receptor occupancy and internalization. Our results suggest that part of the failure of most B1 inhibitors could be ascribed to a lack of knowledge about target function and engagement.

[I-125/131]ITE2 was prepared in good radiochemical yield (94.4 +/- 0.4%) with high radiochemical purity (>99%). [I-125/131]ITE2 had good stability in vitro and moderate molar activity (0.3 +/- 0.2 GBq/mu mol). Higher uptake in ER-positive MCF-7 cells than that of ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells was observed at all time points. Rats biodistribution showed that [I-131]ITE2 had high uptake in ER-abundant uterine and ovarian (5.7 +/- 0.4 and 10.1 +/- 1.4%ID/g at 1 hr postinjection) and could be blocked by co-injection of estradiol (2.7 +/- 0.1 and 5.5 +/- 0.4%ID/g) obviously. In the SPECT/CT imaging study, [I-125]ITE2 showed significant higher uptake in MCF-7 tumor (3.1 +/- 0.4%ID/g) than that of MDA-MB-231 (0.9 +/- 0.1%ID/g). Furthermore, the specific uptake of [I-125]ITE2 in ER-positive MCF-7 tumor could be blocked effectively by preadministration of fulvestrant (1.2 +/- 0.4%ID/g). A novel radioiodinated dimeric estrogen was designed and synthesized with promising ER targeting ability and specificity. It is worthy of further investigation to validate the advantages of the dimer in ER-positive breast cancer diagnosis.

Prolonged FS lasts more than 15 min and may evoke neurological sequelae in a process in which molecular alterations seem to play an important role. Adenosine is a purine nucleoside that exerts anticonvulsant effects through binding to adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1)R). This receptor belongs to the GPCR superfamily and is negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity through Gi proteins. In the present study, we analyzed the functionality of A(1)R, measured as the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC activity, 48 hr after hyperthermia-induced seizures (HIS). Surprisingly, the results obtained show that the activation of A(1)R increased forskolin-stimulated cAMP production instead of decreasing it. This alteration was not accompanied by changes in alpha G protein levels. The functionality of A(1)R remained altered two months after HIS. However, this alteration was abolished when AC assays were carried out in the presence of anti alpha Gs subunit-specific antibody, suggesting that HIS can switch A(1)R coupling from Gi to Gs proteins. Finally, radioligand binding assays revealed that density and affinity of A(1)R were not significantly altered by HIS. In summary, the results obtained show that HIS induces long-term changes in the A(1)R/AC signaling pathway in rat brain cortex.

All seven ligands possessed low nanomolar affinity for sigma(1) receptors (K-i(sigma(1)) = 0.31-4.19 nM) and high subtype selectivity (K-i(sigma(2))/K-i(sigma(1)) = 50-2448). The fluoroethoxy analogues also exhibited high selectivity toward the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (K-i(VAChT)/K-i(sigma(1)) = 99-18252). The corresponding radiotracers [F-18]13, [F-18]14, and [F-18]16 with high selectivity (K-i(sigma(2))/K-i(sigma(1)) > 100, K-i(VAChT)/K-i(sigma(1)) > 1000) were prepared in 42% to 55% radiochemical yields (corrected for decay), greater than 99% radiochemical purity (RCP), and molar activity of about 120 GBq/mu mol at the end of synthesis (EOS). All three radiotracers showed high initial brain uptake in mouse (8.37-11.48% ID/g at 2 min), which was not affected by pretreatment with cyclosporine A, suggesting that they are not substrates for permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp). Pretreatment with SA4503 or haloperidol resulted in significantly reduced brain uptake (35%-62% decrease at 30 min). In particular, [F-18]16 displayed high brain-to-blood ratios and high in vivo metabolic stability. Although it may not be an optimal neuroimaging agent because of its slow kinetics in the mouse brain, [F-18]16 can serve as a lead compound for further structural modifications to explore new potential radiotracers for sigma(1) receptors.

The Supplement Adulterant β-Methylphenethylamine Increases Blood Pressure by Acting at Peripheral Norepinephrine Transporters	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS; DRUGS; CONSTITUENT; MEPHEDRONE; DOPAMINE; ANALOGS; ABUSE	beta-Methylphenethylamine [(BMPEA), 2-phenylpropan-1-amine] is a structural isomer of amphetamine (1-phenylpropan-2-amine) that has been identified in preworkout and weight loss supplements, yet little information is available about its pharmacology. Here, the neurochemical and cardiovascular effects of BMPEA and its analogs, N-methyl-2-phenylpropan-1-amine (MPPA) and N, N-dimethyl-2-phenylpropan-1-amine (DMPPA), were compared with structurally related amphetamines. As expected, amphetamine and methamphetamine were potent substrate-type releasing agents at dopamine transporters (DATs) and norepinephrine transporters (NETs) in rat brain synaptosomes. BMPEA and MPPA were also substrates at DATs and NETs, but they were at least 10-fold less potent than amphetamine. DMPPA was a weak substrate only at NETs. Importantly, the releasing actions of BMPEA and MPPA were more potent at NETs than DATs. Amphetamine produced significant dose-related increases in blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), and locomotor activity in conscious rats fitted with surgically implanted biotelemetry transmitters. BMPEA, MPPA, and DMPPA produced increases in BP that were similar to the effects of amphetamine, but the compounds failed to substantially affect HR or activity. The hypertensive effect of BMPEA was reversed by the alpha-adrenergic antagonist prazosin but not the ganglionic blocker chlorisondamine. Radioligand binding at various G protein-coupled receptors did not identify nontransporter sites of action that could account for cardiovascular effects of BMPEA or its analogs. Our results show that BMPEA, MPPA, and DMPPA are biologically active. The compounds are unlikely to be abused due to weak effects at DATs, but they could produce adverse cardiovascular effects via substrate activity at peripheral NET sites.

The resulting base ligand was characterized on HPLC and used for radiolabelling with technetium-99m. The ligand 4-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylideneamino) benzoic acid was labelled with Tc-99m at pH 7, while reacting 230 A mu g of ligand with 15 mCi of (TcO-)-Tc-99m (4) for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting Tc-99m-ligand complex was characterized by paper chromatography, TLC, HPLC and electrophoresis technique. The stability of the complex was determined at room temperature and in human serum. The biodistribution of the complex was studied in mice and scintigraphy was performed in rabbit. The Tc-99m-ligand complex showed high radiolabelling yield (up to 99 +/- 1%) and high stability at room temperature and in human serum. The newly prepared complex exhibited no net charge. Our newly developed Tc-99m-ligand complex demonstrated high accumulation in liver and spleen of mice as well as in rabbit. Based on these findings, we have suggested that this novel radioligand i.e., Tc-99m- 4-hydroxy-3-(2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzylideneamino) benzoic acid complex could be used for liver and spleen imaging.

Low 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptor binding in the migraine brain: A PET study	CEPHALALGIA			English	Article						Headache; pain modulation; raphe; neuroimaging; serotonin 1B receptors; serotonin	SEROTONIN; ACTIVATION; RESOLUTION; INCREASE; RELEASE; NEURONS	Background: The pathophysiology of migraine may involve dysfunction of serotonergic signaling. In particular, the 5-HT1B receptor is considered a key player due to the efficacy of 5-HT1B receptor agonists for treatment of migraine attacks. Aim: To examine the cerebral 5-HT1B receptor binding in interictal migraine patients without aura compared to controls. Methods: Eighteen migraine patients, who had been migraine free for >48 hours, and 16 controls were scanned after injection of the 5-HT1B receptor specific radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369 for quantification of cerebral 5-HT1B receptor binding. Patients who reported migraine <48 hours after the PET examination were excluded from the final analysis. We defined seven brain regions involved in pain modulation as regions of interest and applied a latent variable model (LVM) to assess the group effect on binding across these regions. Results: Our data support a model wherein group status predicts the latent variable (p = 0.038), with migraine patients having lower 5-HT1B receptor binding across regions compared to controls. Further, in a whole-brain voxel-based analysis, time since last migraine attack correlated positively with 5-HT1B receptor binding in the dorsal raphe and in the midbrain. Conclusion: We report here for the first time that migraine patients have low 5-HT1B receptor binding in pain modulating regions, reflecting decreased receptor density. This is either a primary constitutive trait of the migraine brain or secondary to repeated exposure to migraine attacks. We also provide indirect support for the dorsal raphe 5-HT1B receptors being temporarily downregulated during the migraine attack, presumably in response to higher cerebral serotonin levels in the ictal phase.

[(18) F] DPA-714 has emerged as a promising translocator protein radiotracer as it is fluorinated, highly specific and returned reliable quantification using arterial input function. Cerebellum gray matter was proposed as reference region for simplified quantification; however, this method cannot be used when inflammation involves cerebellum. Here we adapted and validated a supervised clustering (supervised clustering algorithm (SCA)) for [18 F] DPA-714 analysis. Fourteen healthy subjects genotyped for translocator protein underwent an [(18) F] DPA-714 PET, including 10 with metabolite-corrected arterial input function and three for a test-retest assessment. Two-tissue compartmental modelling provided BPND (AIF) estimates that were compared to either BPNDLoganSCA or BPND (LoganCRB) generated by Logan analysis (using supervised clustering algorithm extracted reference region or cerebellum gray matter). The supervised clustering algorithm successfully extracted a pseudo-reference region with similar reliability using classes that were defined using either all subjects, or separated into HAB and MAB subjects. BPND (AIF,) BPNDLoganSCA and BPND (LoganCRB) were highly correlated (ICC of 0.91 +/- 0.05) but BPND (LoganSCA) were similar to 26% higher and less variable than BPND (LoganCRB) . Reproducibility was good with 5% variability in the test-retest study. The clustering technique for [(18) F] DPA-714 provides a simple, robust and reproducible technique that can be used for all neurological diseases.

Methods: Thirty-four MS patients (7 with secondary progressive MS [SPMS], 27 with relapsing remitting MS [RRMS]) and 30 healthy volunteers, genetically stratified for translocator protein (TSPO) binding status, underwent PET scanning with TSPO radioligands (C-11-PBR28 or F-18-PBR111). Regional TSPO availability was measured as a distribution volume ratio (DVR) relative to the caudate (a pseudoreference region). White matter lesions (WMLs) were classified as "active" (DVR highest in the lesion), "peripherally active" (perilesional DVR highest), "inactive" (DVR highest in surrounding NAWM), or "undifferentiated" (similar DVR across lesion, perilesional and NAWM volumes). Results: The mean DVR in NAWM of patients was greater than that of the healthy volunteer white matter for both radioligands. Uptake for individual WML in patients was heterogeneous, but the median WML DVR and NAWM DVR for individual patients were strongly correlated (r = 0.94, P = 4 x 10(-11)). A higher proportion of lesions were inactive in patients with SPMS (35%) than RRMS (23%), but active lesions were found in all patients, including those on highly efficacious treatments. Conclusion: TSPO radioligand uptake was increased in the brains of MS patients relative to healthy controls with 2 TSPO radiotracers. WML showed heterogeneous patterns of uptake. Active lesions were found in patients with both RRMS and SPMS. Their independent prognostic significance needs further investigation.

Synthesis, Biodistribution and In vitro Evaluation of Brain Permeable High Affinity Type 2 Cannabinoid Receptor Agonists [<SUP>11</SUP>C]MA2 and [<SUP>18</SUP>F]MA3	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Type 2 cannabinoid receptor; CB2 agonists; Positron emission tomography; Radiosynthesis	N-ARYLAMIDE OXADIAZOLES; CB2 RECEPTOR; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; VIVO EVALUATION; PET TRACER; RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; MODULATION; SCLEROSIS; TISSUES	The type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2) is a member of the endocannabinoid system and is known for its important role in (neuro)inflammation. A PET-imaging agent that allows in vivo visualization of CB2 expression may thus allow quantification of neuroinflammation. In this paper, we report the synthesis, radiosynthesis, biodistribution and in vitro evaluation of a carbon -11 ([C-11]MA2) and a fluorine-18 ([F-18]MA3) labeled analog of a highly potent N-arylamide oxadiazole CB2 agonist (EC50 = 0.015 nM). MA2 and MA3 behaved as potent CB2 agonist (EC50: 3 nM and 0.1 nM, respectively) and their in vitro binding affinity for hCB2 was found to be 87 nM and 0.8 nM, respectively. Also MA3 (substituted with a fluoro ethyl group) was found to have higher binding affinity and EC50 values when compared to the originally reported trifluoromethyl analog 12. [C-11]MA2 and [F-18]MA3 were successfully synthesized with good radiochemical yield, high radiochemical purity and high specific activity. In mice, both tracers were efficiently cleared from blood and all major organs by the hepatobiliary pathway and importantly these compounds showed high brain uptake. In conclusion, [C-11]MA2 and [F-18]MA3 are shown to be high potent CB2 agonists with good brain uptake, these favorable characteristics makes them potential PET probes for in vivo imaging of brain CB2 receptors. However, in view of its higher affinity and selectivity, further detailed evaluation of MA3 as a PET tracer for CB2 is warranted.

Radioligand binding studies on alpha 7* and alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs (rat brain homogenate) revealed one compound (7) with a 2-fold higher affinity for the alpha 4 beta 2*-subtype, and four compounds (11, 13, 14 and 16) with at least 3-fold higher affinity for alpha 7* nAChR. The most promising was 11, showing K-i similar to 100 nM and over 10-fold selectivity for alpha 7* nAChR. Compounds 7,11, 13 and 16 at 50 mu M suppressed ion currents induced in the rat alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR and the chimeric nAChR composed of the ligand-binding domain of the chick alpha 7 and transmembrane domain of the alpha 1 glycine receptor, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Calcium imaging experiments on the human a7 nAChR expressed in the Neuro2a cells and potentiated by PNU-120596 confirmed the antagonistic activity for alpha 7; on the contrary, 11, 13 and 16 were agonists with the EC50 values in the range of 1.0-1.6 mu M. Thus, the introduced modifications allowed us to enhance the selectivity of quinolines towards alpha 7 nAChR and to get novel compounds with agonistic activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Cannabinoids, including the active component of the Cannabis plant, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and the synthetic alkylindole (AI) compound, WIN55212-2 (WIN-2), activate two molecularly identified GPCRs: CB1 and CB2. Previous studies reported that WIN-2 activates an additional unknown GPCR that is not activated by plant-derived cannabinoids, and evidence indicates that microglia express these receptors. Detailed studies on the role of AI-sensitive receptors in microglial cell activation were difficult as no selective pharmacological tools were available. Here, three newly-developed AI analogues allowed us to determine if microglia express AI-sensitive receptors and if so, study how they regulate the microglial cell activation process. We found that mouse microglia in primary culture express functional AI-sensitive receptors as measured by radioligand binding and changes in intracellular cAMP levels, and that these receptors control both basal and ATP-stimulated migration. AI analogues inhibit cell proliferation stimulated by macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) without affecting basal cell proliferation. Remarkably, AI analogues do not control the expression of effector proteins characteristic of M1 or M2 phenotypes; yet activating microglia with M1 and M2 cytokines reduces the microglial response to AI analogues. Our results suggest that microglia express functional AI-sensitive receptors that control select components of their activation process. Agonists of these novel targets might represent a novel class of therapeutics to influence the microglial cell activation process.

J	Zhang, SJ; Shao, P; Bai, MF				Zhang, Shaojuan; Shao, Pin; Bai, Mingfeng			In Vivo Type 2 Cannabinoid Receptor-Targeted Tumor Optical Imaging Using a Near Infrared Fluorescent Probe	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; EXPRESSION; CANCER; RADIOLIGAND; TISSUES; LIGAND; GROWTH; CELLS	The type 2 cannabinoid receptor (CB2R) plays a vital role in carcinogenesis and progression and is emerging as a therapeutic target for cancers. However, the exact role of CB2R in cancer progression and therapy remains unclear. This has driven the increasing efforts to study CB2R and cancers using molecular imaging tools. In addition, many types of cancers overexpress CB2R, and the expression levels of CB2R appear to be associated with tumor aggressiveness. Such upregulation of the receptor in cancer cells provides opportunities for CB2R-targeted imaging with high contrast and for therapy with low side effects. In the present study, we report the first in vivo tumor-targeted optical imaging using a novel CB2R-targeted near-infrared probe. In vitro cell fluorescent imaging and a competitive binding assay indicated specific binding of NIR760-mbc94 to CB2R in CB2-mid delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells. NIR760-mbc94 also preferentially labeled CB2-mid DBT tumors in vivo, with a 3.7-fold tumor-to-normal contrast enhancement at 72 h postinjection, whereas the fluorescence signal from the tumors of the mice treated with NIR760 free dye was nearly at the background level at the same time point. SR144528, a CB2R competitor, significantly inhibited tumor uptake of NIR760-mbc94, indicating that NIR760-mbc94 binds to CB2R specifically. In summary, NIR760-mbc94 specifically binds to CB2R in vitro and in vivo and appears to be a promising molecular tool that may have great potential for use in diagnostic imaging of CB2R-positive cancers and therapeutic monitoring as well as in elucidating the role of CB2R in cancer progression and therapy.

Analysis of the Structural and Molecular Basis of Voltage-sensitive Sodium Channel Inhibition by the Spider Toxin Huwentoxin-IV (μ-TRTX-Hh2a)	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TARANTULA TOXINS; HAINANTOXIN-IV; VENOM PEPTIDES; DOMAIN-II; MUTATIONS; SENSORS; PROTEIN; SCN9A; PAIN; BINDING	Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are essential to the normal function of the vertebrate nervous system. Aberrant function of VGSCs underlies a variety of disorders, including epilepsy, arrhythmia, and pain. A large number of animal toxins target these ion channels and may have significant therapeutic potential. Most of these toxins, however, have not been characterized in detail. Here, by combining patch clamp electrophysiology and radioligand binding studies with peptide mutagenesis, NMR structure determination, and molecular modeling, we have revealed key molecular determinants of the interaction between the tarantula toxin huwentoxin-IV and two VGSC isoforms, Nav1.7 and Nav1.2. Nine huwentoxin-IV residues (F6A, P11A, D14A, L22A, S25A, W30A, K32A, Y33A, and I35A) were important for block of Nav1.7 and Nav1.2. Importantly, molecular dynamics simulations and NMR studies indicated that folding was normal for several key mutants, suggesting that these amino acids probably make specific interactions with sodium channel residues. Additionally, we identified several amino acids (F6A, K18A, R26A, and K27A) that are involved in isoform-specific VGSC interactions. Our structural and functional data were used to model the docking of huwentoxin-IV into the domain II voltage sensor of Nav1.7. The model predicts that a hydrophobic patch composed of Trp-30 and Phe-6, along with the basic Lys-32 residue, docks into a groove formed by the Nav1.7 S1-S2 and S3-S4 loops. These results provide new insight into the structural and molecular basis of sodium channel block by huwentoxin-IV and may provide a basis for the rational design of toxin-based peptides with improved VGSC potency and/or selectivity.

The objective of this study was to compare total and unbound etravirine concentrations in CSF with plasma concentrations and the in vitro median inhibitory concentration (IC50) for wild-type HIV (0.9 ng/mL). Total and bound etravirine concentrations were measured in 17 CSF and plasma pairs by isotope-dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy, radioligand displacement and ultracentrifugation. Unbound etravirine concentrations were calculated from the bound fraction. The dynamic range of the assay was 7.82000 (plasma) and 0.78200 (CSF) ng/mL. Subjects were mostly middle-aged (median 43 years) white (78) men (89). All CSF etravirine concentrations were above the limit of quantification. Total and unbound median etravirine concentrations in CSF were 9.5 (IQR 6.4, 26.4) and 0.13 (IQR 0.08, 0.27) ng/mL, respectively. Etravirine was 96 (IQR 94.5, 97.2) protein bound in plasma and 98.4 (IQR 97.8, 98.8) in CSF. Total etravirine in CSF was 4.3 (IQR 3, 5.9) of total and 101 (IQR 76, 160) of unbound etravirine in plasma. There were no significant correlations between unbound etravirine concentrations and concentrations of albumin in plasma or CSF. Unbound etravirine concentrations in CSF did not reach the wild-type IC50 in any of the specimens. Unbound etravirine may not achieve optimal concentrations to inhibit HIV replication in the CNS.

The Effect of MII α-Conotoxin and Its N-Terminal Derivatives on Ca<SUP>2+</SUP>- and Na<SUP>+</SUP>-Signals Induced by Nicotine in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF BIOORGANIC CHEMISTRY			English	Article						conotoxins; nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; intracellular Ca2+; intracellular Na+; neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y	PARKINSONS-DISEASE STRIATUM; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; TORPEDO-CALIFORNICA; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; LINE SH-SY5Y; CALCIUM; ANALOGS; BRAIN; SUBTYPES; ANTAGONIST	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+-dependent processes both in normal and pathological states. alpha-Conotoxins from the venom of Conus marine mollusks are a valuable tool for the investigation of the pharmacological action and functional role of nAChRs. Analogues of alpha-conotoxin MII labeled by Bolton-Hunter reagent (BH-MII) or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC-MII) on the N-terminal glycine residue have been synthesized in the present work. Fluorescence microscopy studies of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells loaded with Ca2+ indicator Fura-2, or by both Ca2+ indicator Fluo-4 and Na+ indicator SBFI, were used to test the effect of MII modification on its ability to block Ca2+ and Na+ signals induced by nicotine. Measurements in SH-SY5Y cells showed that kinetics of the increase and recovery of the concentration of free Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) upon nicotine application and washout was different from that for free Na+ ([Na+](i)), this being evidence of differences in the mechanism of Ca2+ and Na+ homeostasis regulation. MII suppressed the nicotine-induced increase of [Ca2+](i) and [Na+](i) in a concentration-dependent manner. An additional tyrosine residue added to the N-terminus of one of the MII derivatives caused a significant decrease in the inhibitory action of MII; this decrease was even more pronounced when a large FITC label was introduced into MII. The BH-MII derivative had an inhibitory effect similar to that of unmodified alpha-conotoxin. MII and its iodinated derivatives are promising tools for radioligand assays.	[Surin, A. M.; Kryukova, E.

Muscarinic receptor subtypes and signalling involved in the attenuation of isoprenaline-induced rat urinary bladder relaxation	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						M-2 muscarinic receptor; M-3 muscarinic receptor; THRX-182087; beta-Adrenoceptor; Relaxation; Urinary bladder	CARBACHOL-INDUCED CONTRACTION; GUINEA-PIG ILEUM; FUNCTIONAL ANTAGONISM; BETA-ADRENOCEPTORS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; M-2; ISOPROTERENOL; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS	beta-Adrenoceptors are important mediators of smooth muscle relaxation in the urinary bladder, but the concomitant presence of a muscarinic agonist, e.g., carbachol, can attenuate relaxation responses by reducing potency and/or efficacy of beta-adrenoceptor agonists such as isoprenaline. Therefore, the present study was designed to explore the subtypes and signalling pathways of muscarinic receptors involved in the attenuation of isoprenaline-induced isolated rat detrusor preparations using novel subtype-selective receptor ligands. In radioligand binding studies, we characterized BZI to be a M-3-sparing muscarinic agonist, providing selective M-2 stimulation in rat bladder, and THRX-182087 as a highly M-2-selective antagonist. The use of BZI and of THRX-182087 in the presence of carbachol enabled experimental conditions with a selective stimulation of only M-2 or M-3 receptors, respectively. Confirming previous findings, carbachol attenuated isoprenaline-induced detrusor relaxation. M-2-selective stimulation partly mimicked this attenuation, indicating that both M-2 and M-3 receptors are involved. During M-3-selective stimulation, the attenuation of isoprenaline responses was reduced by the phospholipase C inhibitor U 73,122 but not by the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine. We conclude that both M-2 and M-3 receptors contribute to attenuation of beta-adrenoceptor-mediated relaxation of rat urinary bladder; the signal transduction pathway involved in the M-3 component of this attenuation differs from that mediating direct contractile effects of M-3 receptors.

We sought to evaluate the properties of [H-3] CUMI-101 ex vivo in awake rats and determine if [H-3] CUMI-101 can measure changes in synaptic levels of serotonin after different challenge paradigms. [H-3] CUMI-101 shows good uptake and good specific binding ratio (SBR) in frontal cortex 5.18 and in hippocampus 3.18. Binding was inhibited in a one-binding-site fashion by WAY100635 and unlabeled CUMI-101. The ex vivo B-max of [H-3] CUMI-101 in frontal cortex (98.7 fmol/mg) and hippocampus (131 fmol/kg) agree with the ex vivo Bmax of [H-3] MPPF in frontal cortex (147.1 fmol/mg) and hippocampus (72.1 fmol/mg) and with in vitro values reported with 8-OH-DPAT. Challenges with citalopram, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fenfluramine, a serotonin releaser, and 4-chloro-DL-phenylalanine, a serotonin synthesis inhibitor, did not show any effect on the standardized uptake values (SUVs) in any region. Citalopram did alter SBR, but this was due to changes in cerebellar SUVs. Our results indicate that [H-3] CUMI-101 is a good radioligand for imaging 5-HT1A high-density regions in rats; however, the results from pharmacological challenges remain inconclusive.

A variety of ligands with divergent structures bind to the BZD site, and the structural mechanisms that couple their binding to potentiation of I-GABA are not well understood. In this study, we measured the effects of individually mutating 22 residues throughout the BZD binding pocket on the abilities of eszopiclone, zolpidem, and flurazepam to potentiate I-GABA. Wild-type and mutant alpha(1)beta(2)gamma(2) GABA(A)Rs were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes and analyzed using a two-electrode voltage clamp. GABA EC50, BZD EC50, and BZD maximal potentiation were measured. These data, combined with previous radioligand binding data describing the mutations' effects on BZD apparent binding affinities (J Neurosci 28:3490-3499, 2008; J Med Chem 51:7243-7252, 2008), were used to distinguish residues within the BZD pocket that contribute to BZD efficacy and BZD binding. We identified six residues whose mutation altered BZD maximal potentiation of I-GABA (BZD efficacy) without altering BZD binding apparent affinity, three residues whose mutation altered binding but had no effect on BZD efficacy, and four residues whose mutation affected both binding and efficacy. Moreover, depending on the BZD ligand, the effects of some mutations were different, indicating that the structural mechanisms underlying the ability of BZD ligands with divergent structures to potentiate I-GABA are distinct.

Pharmacological Evaluation of the Long-Term Effects of Xanomeline on the M<sub>1</sub> Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor	PLOS ONE			English	Article							AGONIST; PROTEIN; BINDING; DESENSITIZATION; SELECTIVITY; SUBTYPES; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; CELLS; M1	Xanomeline is a unique agonist of muscarinic receptors that possesses functional selectivity at the M-1 and M-4 receptor subtypes. It also exhibits wash-resistant binding to and activation of the receptor. In the present work we investigated the consequences of this type of binding of xanomeline on the binding characteristics and function of the M-1 muscarinic receptor. Pretreatment of CHO cells that stably express the M-1 receptor for 1 hr with increasing concentrations of xanomeline followed by washing and waiting for an additional 23 hr in control culture media transformed xanomeline-induced inhibition of [H-3] NMS binding from monophasic to biphasic. The high-affinity xanomeline binding site exhibited three orders of magnitude higher affinity than in the case of xanomeline added directly to the binding assay medium containing control cells. These effects were associated with a marked decrease in maximal radioligand binding and attenuation of agonist-induced increase in PI hydrolysis and were qualitatively similar to those caused by continuous incubation of cells with xanomeline for 24 hr. Attenuation of agonist-induced PI hydrolysis by persistently-bound xanomeline developed with a time course that parallels the return of receptor activation by prebound xanomeline towards basal levels. Additional data indicated that blockade of the receptor orthosteric site or the use of a non-functional receptor mutant reversed the long-term effects of xanomeline, but not its persistent binding at an allosteric site. Furthermore, the long-term effects of xanomeline on the receptor are mainly due to receptor down-regulation rather than internalization.	[Grant, Marianne K.

Association of the Novel Non-AT<sub>1</sub>, Non-AT<sub>2</sub> Angiotensin Binding Site with Neuronal Cell Death	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							NADPH OXIDASE; BRAIN; RECEPTORS; PHOSPHORYLATION; MICRODIALYSIS; GLUTATHIONE; MECHANISMS; CALCIUM; SYSTEM	We have discovered a non-AT(1), non-AT(2) angiotensin binding site in rodent and human brain membranes, which, based on its pharmacological/biochemical properties and tissue distribution, is different from angiotensin receptors and key proteases processing angiotensins. In this study, the novel angiotensin binding site was localized to a specific brain cell type by using radioligand receptor binding assays. Our results indicate that the novel binding site is expressed in mouse primary cortical neuronal membranes but not in primary cortical astroglial and bEnd.3 brain capillary endothelial cell membranes. Whole-cell binding assays in neurons showed that the binding site faces the outer side of the plasma membrane. Consistent with our previous observations, the novel binding site was unmasked by the sulfhydryl reagent p-chloromercuribenzoate. This effect had a bell-shaped curve and was reversed by reduced glutathione, indicating that the function of the binding site might be regulated by the redox state of the environment. Density of the novel binding site measured by saturation binding assays was significantly increased in neuronal membranes of cells challenged in four in vitro models of cell death (oxygen-glucose deprivation, sodium azide-induced hypoxia, N-methyl-D-aspartate neurotoxicity, and hydrogen peroxide neurotoxicity). In addition, our in vivo data from developing mouse brains showed that the density of the novel angiotensin binding site changes similarly to the pattern of neuronal death in maturating brain. This is the first time that evidence is provided on the association of the novel angiotensin binding site with neuronal death, and future studies directed toward understanding of the functions of this protein are warranted.

The α<sub>2</sub>-Adrenoceptor Component	BASIC & CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & TOXICOLOGY			English	Article							ALPHA-2-ADRENOCEPTOR SUBTYPES; ALPHA(2A)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; H-3 RAUWOLSCINE; GUINEA-PIG; TAIL-FLICK; RAT; BINDING; ANTAGONISTS; INHIBITION; ADJUVANT	Previously, we reported that antinociceptive synergism of a 5-HT3/alpha(2)-adrenoceptor ligand MD-354 (m-chlorophenylguanidine) and clonidine combination occurs, in part, through a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist mechanism. In the present investigation, a possible role for alpha(2)-adrenoceptors was examined. Mechanistic studies using yohimbine (a subtype non-selective alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist), BRL 44408 (a preferential alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor antagonist) and imiloxan (a preferential alpha(2B/C)-adrenoceptor antagonist) on the antinociceptive actions of a MD-354/clonidine combination were conducted. Subcutaneous pre-treatment with all three antagonists inhibited the antinociceptive synergism of MD-354 and clonidine in the mouse tail-flick assay in a dose-dependent manner (AD(50) = 0.33, 2.1, and 0.17 mg/kg, respectively). Enhancement of clonidine antinociception by MD-354 did not potentiate clonidine's locomotor suppressant activity in a mouse locomotor assay. When [ethyl-3H]RS-79948-197 was used as radioligand, MD-354 displayed almost equal affinity to alpha(2A)- and alpha(2B)-adrenoceptors (K-i = 110 and 220 nM) and showed lower affinity at alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors (K-i = 4,700 nM). MD-354 had no subtype-selectivity for the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor subtypes as an antagonist in functional [35S]GTP gamma S binding assays. MD-354 was a weak partial agonist at alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. Overall, in addition to the 5-HT3 receptor component, the present investigation found MD-354 to be a weak partial alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor agonist that enhances clonidine's thermal antinociceptive actions through an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor-mediated mechanism without augmenting sedation.

The 2 beta-[3'-(substituted benzyl)isoxazol-5-yl]-3 beta-(substituted phenyl)tropanes (3a-h) showed high binding affinities for the dopamine transporter (DAT). The IC50 values ranged from 5.9 to 22 nM. On the other hand, the 2 beta-[3'-methyl- 4'-(substituted phenyl)isoxazol-5-yl]-3 beta-(substituted phenyl)tropanes (4a-h), with IC50 values ranging from 65 to 173 nM, were approximately 3- to 25-fold less potent than the corresponding 2 beta-[ 3'-(substituted benzyl)isoxazol] tropanes. All tested compounds were selective for the DAT relative to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and serotonin transporter (5-HTT). 3 beta-(4-Methylphenyl)-2 beta-[3'-(4-fluorobenzyl)isoxazol-5-yl] tropane (3b) with IC50 of 5.9 nM at the DAT and K(i)s of 454 and 113 nM at the NET and 5-HTT, respectively, was the most potent and DAT-selective analog. Molecular modeling studies suggested that the rigid conformation of the isoxazole side chain in 4a-h might play an important role on their low DAT binding affinities. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Molecular characterisation of the interactions between olmesartan and telmisartan and the human angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						angiotensin II; AT(1) receptor; olmesartan; telmisartan; losartan; EXP3174; receptor interactions; insurmountability	HAMSTER OVARY CELLS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; TYPE-1 RECEPTOR; INTERNATIONAL UNION; ANTAGONIST BINDING; NONPEPTIDE AT(1); CHO-K1 CELLS; IN-VITRO; BLOCKERS; INHIBITION	Background and purpose: Whereas some angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor blockers (ARBs) produce surmountable antagonism of AT(1) receptors, others such as olmesartan and telmisartan display varying degrees of insurmountability. This study compared the molecular interactions of olmesartan and telmisartan with the human AT(1) receptor, using well characterised in vitro methods and model systems. Experimental approach: CHO-K1 cells that stably express human AT(1) receptors (CHO-hAT(1) cells) were used in several pharmacological studies of olmesartan and telmisartan, including direct radioligand binding and inhibition of Ang II-induced inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation. Key results: Both ARBs were found to be competitive antagonists that displayed high affinity, slow dissociation, and a high degree of insurmountability for the AT(1) receptor (the latter greater with olmesartan). Their receptor interactions could be described by a two-step process with the initial formation of a loose complex (IR) and subsequent transformation into a tight binding complex (IR*). In washout experiments, [H-3] telmisartan dissociated from the receptor with a half-life of 29 min and the Ang II-mediated IP accumulation response was 50% maximally restored within 24 min, whereas values for [H-3] olmesartan were 72 min and 76 min, respectively. Conclusions and implications: The high degree of insurmountability, slow dissociation, and high affinity of olmesartan for its receptor may relate to its ability to stabilise IR* via the carboxyl group of its imidazole core. In comparison, telmisartan displays a less potent interaction with the receptor.

Striatal dopamine release and family history of alcoholism	ALCOHOLISM-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						alcoholism; family history; PET; dopamine; amphetamine	MULTIMODALITY IMAGE REGISTRATION; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; VENTRAL STRIATUM; D-2 RECEPTORS; AMPHETAMINE; ETHANOL; SONS	Background: The offspring of alcohol-dependent individuals are at increased risk for alcoholism. The present study was designed to determine whether mesolimbic dopamine binding potential (BP), dopamine release, stress hormones, and subjective responses to intravenous amphetamine are different in nonalcoholic offspring from families with a history of alcohol dependence [family history positive (FHP)] than in nonalcoholic offspring without a family history of alcohol dependence [family history negative (FHN)]. Methods: Participants were 41 healthy men and women (11 FHP, 30 FHN; age range 18-29). After completing baseline psychiatric symptom and personality measures, striatal D(2)/D(3) dopamine BP and dopamine release in response to an amphetamine challenge were measured with positron emission tomography (PET) using the D(2)/D(3) dopamine (DA) receptor radioligand [(11)C]raclopride. Binding potential was defined as B(max)/KD, percent change in BP from baseline defined dopamine release. During the scans, subjects rated the degree to which they were experiencing each of 10 possible drug effects. Plasma cortisol and growth hormone (GH) were also measured at scheduled intervals during the scans. Results: Neither baseline BP nor dopamine release differed by family history. Similarly, subjective responses to amphetamine did not differ by a family history of alcoholism. Although both cortisol and GH increased following administration of amphetamine, these increases did not differ between family history groups. Conclusions: Using amphetamine to provoke mesolimbic dopamine, we did not show significant differences in dopamine release, subjective responses, or stress hormone measures as a function of family history of alcoholism.

Identical values were obtained with the two types of assay methods, 14 pM and 0.9 nM in free or NMS-liganded receptor states, respectively, highlighting a strong negative cooperativity between this allosteric toxin and NMS. Identical results were obtained with indirect binding experiments with [H-3] NMS using the ternary complex model, clearly demonstrating the reciprocal nature of this cooperativity. Furthermore, the effects of various orthosteric and allosteric agents on the dissociation kinetic of I-125-MT7ox were measured and show that, except for the MT1 toxin, all of the ligands studied [ NMS, atropine, gallamine, brucine, tacrine, staurosporine, and (9S, 10S, 12R)-2,3,9,10,11-hexahydro-10-hydroxy-9-methyl-1-oxo-9,12- epoxy-1H-diindolo[1,2,3- fg: 3', 2', 1'-kl] pyrrolo[ 3,4-i][1,6]benzodiazocine-10-carboxylic acid hexyl ester (KT5720)] interact allosterically with muscarinic toxin 7. Equilibrium binding experiments with I-125-MT7ox and [H-3] NMS were conducted to reveal the effects of these ligands on the free receptor, and affinity constants (pK(x) values) were calculated using the allosteric ternary complex model. Our results suggest that MT7 toxin interacts with hM(1) receptor at a specific allosteric site, which may partially overlap those identified previously for "classic" or "atypical" allosteric agents and highlight the potential of this new allosteric tracer in studying allosterism at muscarinic receptors.

Methods: White male New Zealand rabbits were treated with doxorubicine (3 mg/kg/week; 6 weeks) to induce dilative non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. Thereafter, we obtained autologous bone marrow stem cells (BMSC) and injected 1.5-2.0 Mio cells in 1 ml medium by infiltrating the myocardium via a left anterolateral thoracotomy in comparison to sham-operated rabbits. 4 weeks later intracardiac contractility was determined in-vivo using a Millar catheter. Thereafter, the heart was excised and processed for radioligand binding assays to detect beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptor density. In addition, catecholamine plasma levels were determined via HPLC. In a subgroup we investigated cardiac electrophysiology by use of 256 channel mapping. Results: In doxorubicine-treated animals beta-adrenoceptor density was significantly down-regulated in left ventricle and septum, but not in right ventricle, thereby indicating a typical left ventricular heart failure. Sham-operated rabbits exhibited the same down-regulation. In contrast, BMSC transplantation led to significantly less beta-adrenoceptor down-regulation in septum and left ventricle. Cardiac contractility was significantly decreased in heart failure and sham-operated rabbits, but was significantly higher in BMSC-transplanted hearts. Norepinephrine and epinephrine plasma levels were enhanced in heart failure and sham-operated animals, while these were not different from normal in BMSC-transplanted animals. Electrophysiological mapping revealed unaltered electrophysiology and did not show signs of arrhythmogeneity. Conclusion: BMSC transplantation improves sympathoadrenal dysregualtion in non-ischemic heart failure.

The cell membrane stationary phase (CMSP) consists of porous silica coated with active cell membranes. By immersing silica into a Suspension of cell membranes, the whole surface of silica was covered by the cell membranes. The present study repeatedly investigated the interaction between ligands and receptors by employing the system of CMC and especially evaltiated the accuracy and feasibility of the CMC model in the study of subtype receptors. The cDNA encoding alpha(1A) or alpha(1B) adrenergic receptors (ARs) was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cell lines; cell lines stably overexpressing subtype receptors were obtained. HEK293 alpha(1A) or HEK293 alpha(1B) ARs CMSP were prepared by immobilizing relevant cell membranes on silica. In the described chromatography-based CMSP. the retention times of nine alpha(1) adrenoceptor ligands and calculated capacity factors. as chromatographic parameters, were recorded carefully. These results showed a good correlation with the affinity of the same compounds for the corresponding cloned alpha(1) adrenoceptor subtype. The rank order of capacity factors was consistent with the affinity rank order obtained from radioligand binding assays. The immobilized subtype-selective CMSP was stable and reproducible. The study demonstrates that the HEK293 alpha(1A) and HEK293 alpha(1B) CMSP can be utilized for initial screening of drug candidates. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In the past, however, N-methylations of carbachol have provided N-methylcarbamoylcholine and N,N-dimethylcarbamoylcholine (DMCC), which predominantly display nicotinic activity. In this study, 12 homologous analogs of DMCC and its corresponding tertiary amine, N, N-dimethylcarbamoyl-N,N-dimethylaminoethanol, were synthesized and their binding affinities to native mAChR and nAChR sites estimated. One of the compounds in the series, 3-N,N-dimethylaminobutyl-N,N-dimethylcarbamate (7), displayed low nanomolar binding affinity to nAChRs and a 400-fold selectivity for nAChRs over mAChRs. Hence, a new series of compounds was synthesized in which alkyl and aryl groups and different ring systems were introduced in the carbamate moiety of 7. In a [H-3]epibatidine binding assay, the K-i values of 7 and its analogs at rat alpha2beta2, alpha4beta2, alpha2beta4, alpha3beta4, and alpha4beta4 nAChRs, stably expressed in mammalian cell lines, ranged from low nanomolar to midmicromolar concentrations, whereas all of the compounds displayed weak binding to an alpha7/5-HT3 chimera and to native mAChRs. Compound 7 and its analogs were determined to be agonists at the alpha3beta4 nAChR subtype. This series includes the most potent and selective nicotinic agonists structurally derived from ACh to date. Furthermore, the compounds are tertiary amines, implying some advantages in terms of bioavailability pertinent to future in vivo pharmacological studies. Finally, observations made in the study hold promising perspectives for future development of ligands selective for specific nAChR subtypes.

Both yield and specific activity (pmoles of radioligand binding per mg protein) were optimized for H-3-PN200-110 (transverse tubule marker) and 3 H-ryanodine (terminal cisternae marker) binding sites. By pelleting crude microsomes between 2,000 an 12,000 x g without any rehomogenizations, we improved both the yield and specific activity of transverse tubule and terminal cisternae markers in crude microsomes by approximately 4-fold to 1000-3000 pmoles binding sites (starting material: approximately 400 grams wet weight fast twitch skeletal muscle), with 10-15 pmoles/mg. Rehomogenization of the 1,000 x g pellet, which is typically discarded, allowed recovery of an additional 5000 pmoles PN200-110 binding sites and an additional 8000 pmoles ryanodine binding sites. Crude microsomes from the rehomogenized 1,000 x g pellets typically displayed specific activities of 20-25 pmoles binding/mg for both H-3-PN200-110 and 3 H-ryanodine. Separation of crude microsomes on a sucrose gradient increased specific activity up to a maximum of 50 pmoles/mg in a specific fraction, a five- to ten-fold increase over standard triadic or terminal cisternae preparations. The mean specific activity for enriched triads was 30-40 pmoles/mg for both H-3-PN200-110 and ryanodine in pooled fractions, while pooled fractions of enriched terminal cisternae displayed low 3 H-PN200-1 10 binding (3-5 pmoles/ mg) and high 3 H-ryanodine-specific activity (30-40 pmoles/mg).

The alpha(2A)Ser201 mutant had a Cys-->Ser201 (position 5.43) amino-acid substitution, and alpha(2A)Ser201Cys200 and alpha(2A)Ser201Cys204 had Ser-->Cys200 (5.42) and Ser-->Cys204 (5.46) substitutions, respectively, in addition to the Cys-->Ser201 substitution. 2 Automated docking methods were used to predict the receptor interactions of the ligands. Radioligand-binding assays and functional [S-35] GTPgammaS-binding assays were performed using transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells to experimentally corroborate the predicted binding modes. 3 The hydroxyl groups of phenethylamines were found to have different effects on ligand affinity towards the activated and resting forms of the wild-type alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. Substitution of Ser200 or Ser204 with cysteine caused a deterioration in the capability of catecholamines to activate the alpha(2A)-adrenoceptor. The findings indicate that (i) Cys201 plays a significant role in the binding of catecholamine ligands and UK14,304 (for the latter, by a hydrophobic interaction), but Cys201 is not essential for receptor activation; (ii) Ser200 interacts with the meta-hydroxyl group of phenethylamine ligands, affecting both catecholamine binding and receptor activation; while (iii) substituting Ser204 with a cysteine interferes both with the binding of catecholamine ligands and with receptor activation, due to an interaction between Ser204 and the para-hydroxyl group of the catecholic ring.

Isolated nuclei from porcine cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (PCECs) produced PAF-molecular species in response to H2O2. Using FACS analysis, we demonstrated the expression of PAF receptors on cell and nuclear surfaces of PCECs. Confocal microscopy studies performed on PCECs, Chinese hamster ovary cells stably overexpressing PAF receptors, and isolated nuclei from PCECs also showed a robust nuclear distribution of PAF receptors. Presence of PAF receptors at the cell nucleus was further revealed in brain endothelial cells by radioligand binding experiments, immunoblotting, and in situ in brain by immunoelectron microscopy. Stimulation of nuclei with methylcarbamate-PAF evoked a decrease in cAMP production and a pertussis toxin-sensitive rise in nuclear calcium, unlike observations in plasma membrane, which exhibited a pertussis toxin-insensitive elevation in inositol phosphates. Moreover, on isolated nuclei methylcarbamate-PAF evoked the expression of proinflammatory genes inducible nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and was associated with augmented extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB binding to the DNA consensus sequence. COX-2 expression was prevented by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and NF-kappaB inhibitors. This study describes for the first time the nucleus as a putative organelle capable of generating PAF and expresses its receptor, which upon stimulation induces the expression of the proinflammatory gene COX-2.

The totality of peripheral blood lymphocytes express acetylcholine (ACh) immunoreactivity, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), vesicular ACh transporter (VAChT) and M2-M5 muscarinic cholinergic receptor protein immunoreactivity. Western blot analysis performed independently on T and B lymphocytes using anti-ChAT and anti-AChE antibodies revealed labelling of single bands of approximately 68 - 70 and 70 kDa, respectively, whereas VAChT was bound to two bands of approximately 80 and 45 kDa. The pattern of inummoblotting was similar in membranes of lymphocytes and striatum, used as a reference brain tissue. Western blot analysis using anti M2-M5 receptor antibodies revealed labelling of single bands of approximately 55, 85-90, 50 and 81 kDa, respectively. Confocal laser immunofluorescence showed the localization of ACh and VAChT immunoreactivity in punctiform areas likely corresponding to cytoplasmic vesicles. ChAT and AChE were diffused to the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. Muscarinic receptor immunoreactivity was located in lymphocyte plasma membrane. Although the role of lymphocyte cholinergic system is still unclear, the demonstration of cholinergic markers in T and B human blood lymphocytes supports the view that a cholinergic systems may contribute to the regulation of immune function. The characterization of these cholinergic markers may also contribute to define if their evaluation can be used for assessing the status of brain cholinergic system. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Freshly harvested sheep bronchial airway smooth muscle contains a homogeneous population of the ETA receptor. However, the potency of ET-1 and maximum contractile response of sheep bronchial explants to ET-1 increased with time in culture, despite these parameters remaining constant for carbachol in explants maintained for up to 48 h. The possibility that this was caused by changes in ET receptor density was assessed using light microscopic quantitative autoradiography. In view of the increased responsiveness to ET-1 in cultured explants, it was surprising to demonstrate a significant decrease in total ET receptor (59+/-6% compared with the initial value, n=4-5; P<0.01) and ETA receptor (51±2% compared with the initial value, n=4-5, P<0.01) density in sheep bronchial explants after 48 h. No ETB receptors were detected. Thus, the culture of sheep bronchial explants was associated with an increase in ETA receptor-mediated contractile function that was accompanied by a decrease in ETA receptor density. In addition, the structural integrity of the ciliated epithelium was preserved using this culture protocol, a feature that is critical to successful respiratory viral infection. The significant changes in ET receptor density and function in-these bronchial explants must be carefully considered when assessing any effects of respiratory viral infection in this model.

The SRIH receptor subtypes ((1)-sst(5)) that control ACTH release remain unknown. Using novel, subtype-selective SRIH analogs, we have identified the SRIH receptor subtypes involved in regulating ACTH release from AtT-20 cells, a model for cell line pituitary corticotropes. Radioligand-binding studies with I-125-SRIH-14 and I-125-SRIH-28 showed that SRIH-14 and SRIH-28 recognized specific, high-affinity and saturable membrane-binding sites. Nonpeptidyl agonists with selectivity for the sst(2) (L-779,976; compound 2) or sst(1)/sst(5)) (L-817,818; compound 5) receptor subtypes potently displaced I-125-SRIH-28 from AtT-20 cell membranes, while agonists selective for the sst(1) (L-779,591; compound 1), sst(3) (L-796,778; compound 3) or sst(4) (L-803,087; compound 4) subtypes were inactive. Tyr(11)-SRIH-14, compound 2 (sst(2)) or compound 5 (sst(5)) inhibited forskolin and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-induced increases in intracellular CAMP. Furthermore, the sst(2) and sst(5) agonists potently inhibited CRH-induced ACTH release from AtT-20 cells. These results provide the first evidence that sst(2) and sst(5) receptor subtypes, but not sst(1), sst(3) or sst(4), inhibit CAMP accumulation and regulate ACTH secretion in the AtT-20 cell model of the rodent corticotrope.

Down-regulation of the biologically active binding sites (i.e. NPR-A and NPR-B) could explain the blunted response to cardiac natriuretic hormones observed in heart failure (HF), but not the increased metabolic clearance rate. Variations in the ratio between biological and clearance (NPR-C) receptors in target tissue may explain this increase. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of NPR-C receptors on platelets, in patients with HF. Methods: Eighteen patients with HF (NYHA class: I-II, n = 8; III-IV, n = 10) and 18 age-matched healthy subjects were studied. The affinity constant (K-d) and density (B-max) of binding sites were derived by saturation assays on platelet suspensions using I-125-ANP as radioligand. Results: B-max increased as a function of the severity of disease: 21.3 +/- 3.3 fmol/10(9) cells in class III-IV, 11.7 +/- 2.2 in class I-II, and 11.6 +/- 1.1 in controls, respectively (P = 0.0179 for class III-IV vs. controls and P = 0.0451 vs. NYHA I-II). Conclusions: The increase in density of 'clearance' receptors in severe HF is theoretically consistent with the reduction in cardiac natriuretic peptide biological activity, as well as the increase in metabolic clearance rate. This suggests that clearance receptor blockade may be of potential therapeutic value in HIT. (C) 2001 European Society of Cardiology. All rights reserved.

Molecular cloning of the C3aR has facilitated studies to identify nonpeptide antagonists of the C3aR. A chemical lead that selectively inhibited the C3aR in a high throughput screen was identified and chemically optimized. The resulting antagonist, N-2-[(2,2-diphenylethoxy)acetyl]-L-arginine (SB 290157), functioned as a competitive antagonist of I-125-C3a radioligand binding to rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 cells expressing the human C3aR (RBL-C3aR), with an IC50 of 200 nM. SB 290157 was a functional antagonist, blocking C3a-induced C3aR internalization in a concentration-dependent manner and C3a-induced Ca2+ mobilization in RBL-C3aR cells and human neutrophils with IC(50)s of 27.7 and 28 nM, respectively. SB 290157 was selective for the C3aR in that it did not antagonize the C5aR or six other chemotactic G protein-coupled receptors. Functional antagonism was not solely limited to the human C3aR; SB 290157 also inhibited C3a-induced Ca2+ mobilization of RBL-2H3 cells expressing the mouse and guinea pig C3aRs. It potently inhibited C3a-mediated ATP release from guinea pig platelets and inhibited C3a-induced potentiation of the contractile response to field stimulation of perfused rat caudal artery. Furthermore, in animal models, SB 290157, inhibited neutrophil recruitment in a guinea pig LPS-induced airway neutrophilia model and decreased paw edema in a rat adjuvant-induced arthritis model. This selective antagonist may be useful to define the physiological and pathophysiological roles of the C3aR.

J	Dawson, ES; Wells, JN				Dawson, ES; Wells, JN			Determination of amino acid residues that are accessible from the ligand binding crevice in the seventh transmembrane-spanning region of the human A<sub>1</sub> adenosine receptor	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTOR; SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; SEGMENT; CHANNEL; A(1)-ADENOSINE; EXPRESSION; CLONING	The substituted-cysteine accessibility method (SCAM) was applied to transmembrane span seven of the human A(1) adenosine receptor (hA(1)AR) to reveal a subset of amino acids that are exposed to the ligand-binding crevice. The SCAM approach involved a systematic probe of receptor structure by individual substitutions of residues K265 (7.30) to R296 (7.61) with cysteine. In most cases, hA(1)AR substituted-cysteine mutant membranes displayed antagonist dissociation binding constants that did not differ significantly from wild-type (WT). Radioligand binding assays were used to compare cell membranes that were treated with hydrophilic, sulfhydryl-specific methanethiosulfonate derivatives with control cell membranes. Position H278 was previously reported to be required for A(1)AR ligand binding; however, that report did not establish that H278 represents a contact point for ligands. Cysteine-substitution at H278 yields membrane preparations with greatly decreased receptor density compared with WT membranes from cells in the same transfection experiment. However, H278C membranes retain a measurable fraction of antagonist binding. This observation allows for the investigation of binding-crevice accessibility at position 278 and suggests that H278 may not be required for binding of antagonist ligands. Our data reveal the binding-crevice accessibility of residues T270 (7.35), A273 (7.38), I274 (7.39), T277 (7.42), H278 (7.43), N284 (7.49), and Y288 (7.53) in the hA(1)AR. These data are consistent with the high-resolution structure of bovine rhodopsin that features three alpha -helical turns in this region that are interrupted by an elongated, nonhelical structure from positions 7.43 to 7.48 in the primary amino acid sequence.

More ligands (agonist and antagonist) are needed to explore the multiple functions of PPAR, particularly PPAR gamma. In order to complete such ligand screening, a binding test should be assessed versus the classical transactivation reporter gene assay. In the present work. the full-length human PPAR gamma protein as well as its ligand binding domain portion were expressed in Escherichia coli. Bacterial membrane preparations expressing those constructs were characterized using a classical binding competition assay [H-3]rosiglitazone as the radioligand. When the receptor preparations were soluble, binding had to be measured with a new alternative method. The systems were assessed using a series of reference PPAR (alpha, beta and gamma) ligands. The full-length human PPAR gamma fused to glutathione-S-transferase, expressed in E. coli and tested as a bacterial membrane-bound protein led to the most accurate results when compared to the literature. Furthermore, in an attempt to complete the panel of natural PPAR gamma ligands, 29 commercially available prostaglandins were screened in the binding assay. Prostaglandins H-1 and H-2 were found to be modest ligands, however as potent as 15 Delta (12-14) prostaglandin J(2). These results were confirmed in the classical transactivation assay. The fact that these three prostaglandins were equally potent, suggests new pathways of PPAR gamma -linked gene activation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The in vitro-in vivo correlation for P-gp-mediated transport activity was also examined by comparing in vitro data obtained from L-mdr1a cell studies and in vivo data from mdr1a (-/-)/(+/+) CF-1 mice studies for several compounds. The results are summarized as follows: 1) two in vitro assay systems routinely identified the substrate for human MDR1 P-gp-mediated transport with similar quantitative results; 2) in vitro studies with L-MDR1 and L-mdr1a cells demonstrated that the P-gp substrate susceptibility is different between human and mouse for certain compounds (species difference); and 3) in vivo brain concentration ratios of mdr1a (-/-) to (+/+) CF-1 mice, either at a certain time point or up to 60 min, correlated well with the in vitro transcellular transport ratios from L-mdr1a cells (r(2) = 0.968 and 0.926, respectively). This indicates that, at least in mice, the in vitro data are valid predictors of the in vivo contribution of P-gp: the contribution of P-gp to the distribution of the compound to the brain up to 60 min post i.v. administration. These results provide a rationale for predicting in vivo relevance of P-gp in human from in vitro data using human P-gp-expressing cells.

Methods. We used a set of subtype-specific rabbit antibodies to visualize beta (1)- and beta (2)-AR in rat kidney by immunohistochemistry and specified cells and segments of the nephron thought to be regulated by catecholamines. In addition. the relative proportion of beta -AR subtypes in cortical and medullary portions of rat kidney was determined by Western blotting and by competing [I-125]-cyanopindolol binding with the beta (1)- or beta (2)-selective antagonists bisoprolol or ICI 118,551. respectively. Results. Immunoreactivity for beta (1)-AR was found in mesangial cells, juxtaglomerular granular cells, the macula dense epithelium. proximal and distal tubular segments, and acid-secreting type A intercalated cells of the cortical and medullary collecting ducts. Immunoreactivity for beta (2)-AR was predominantly localized in the apical and subapical compartment of proximal and. to a lesser extent, distal tubular epithelia (suggesting interactions with luminal fluid catecholamines). Both subtypes were dense in the membranes of smooth muscle cells from renal arteries. Concordant data were obtained by radioligand binding and immunoblotting of membranes prepared from cortical and medullary portions of the kidney. Conclusion. Our data provide an immunohistochemical basis for the cellular targets of beta -adrenergic regulation of renal function. Moreover. they could help to devise therapeutic strategies directed at renal beta -ARs.

Cryopreserved human brain tissue can be used for functional as well as radioligand binding studies of neuronal proteins. The drug-induced inhibition of [I-125]RTI-55 binding to, and [H-3] DA uptake by, cryopreserved human caudate preparations has now been characterized. Using human caudate membranes, a single site for [I-125] RTI-55 binding was observed in association and saturation experiments. The relative potencies of 22 drugs for inhibition of [I-125] RTI-55 binding to membranes prepared from cryopreserved human caudate, fresh rat striatum, and HEK293 cells expressing the recombinant human DAT (HEK-hDAT) were highly correlated. The affinity of DA for the DAT, as measured by [H-3] DA uptake experiments, was higher in both the cryopreserved human caudate and freshly prepared rat striatum than in HEK-hDAT cells. Although affinities were similar in rat and human brain tissue preparations, the maximal uptake rate in the cryopreserved human caudate was approximately 1 to 4% and 7% of the rate in fresh and cryopreserved rat striatal preparations, respectively. The relative potencies of 22 drugs for inhibition of [H-3] DA uptake were similar for tissue prepared from cryopreserved human caudate, nonfrozen rat striatum, and intact HEK-hDAT cells. These data suggest that cryopreserved human caudate can be used to characterize drug interactions with the DAT, and that HEK-hDAT cells provide a comparable system for modeling the initial interaction of drugs with native hDAT.

Mammalian and nonmammalian:GnRH-R have key structural differences (notably the lack of C-terminal tails in mammalian GnRH-R) and comparative studies are beginning to reveal their functional relevance. However, cellular context and receptor density influence G protein-coupled receptor function and may be important variables in such work using heterologous expression systems. Here we report a comparative study using alpha T4 cells (gonadotrope progenitors that lack endogenous GnRH-R) transfected with a mammalian (human) or nonmammalian (Xenopus laevis type I) GnRH-R. Because conventional transfection strategies proved inefficient, recombinant adenovirus expressing these receptors were constructed, enabling controlled and efficient GnRH-R expression. When expressed in alpha T4 cells at physiological density, these GnRH-Rs retain the pharmacology of their endogenous counterparts (as judged by ligand specificity in radioligand binding and inositol phosphate accumulation assays) but do not activate adenylyl cyclase and are not constitutively active. Moreover, the Xenopus GnRH-R rapidly desensitizes and internalizes in these cells, whereas the human GnRH-R does not, and the internalization rates are not dependent upon receptor number. These data extend studies in COS, HEK, and GH(3) cells showing that other GnRH-R with C-terminal tails desensitize and internalize rapidly, whereas tail-less mammalian GnRH-R do not. Retention of these distinctions at physiological receptor density in gonadotrope lineage cells, supports the argument that the evolution of nondesensitizing mammalian GnRH-Rs is functionally relevant and related to the development of mammalian reproductive strategies.

J	Adderley, SR; Fitzgerald, DJ				Adderley, SR; Fitzgerald, DJ			Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists induce apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes by caspase-3 activation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							IN-VIVO INHIBITORS; PLATELET-AGGREGATION; IIIA RECEPTOR; IIB-IIIA; CELLS; FIBRINOGEN; INVIVO; POTENT; SEQUENCE; PEPTIDE	The platelet integrin glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa, which mediates platelet aggregation, has been the target for novel antiplatelet agents, the GPIIb/IIIa antagonists. Several GPIIb/IIIa antagonists have been developed based on the peptide RGDS present in adhesion proteins, including the principle ligand fibrinogen. The apoptosis enzyme, procaspase-3, contains an RGD-recognition sequence and is activated by RGDS. We examined the effects of RGDS and several GPIIb/IIIa antagonists on cell death and procaspase-3 activation in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, These antagonists do not recognize rat integrins, yet RGDS, orbofiban, and xemilofiban induced dose-dependent apoptosis and procaspase-3 activation in cardiomyocytes over 72 h, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Scrambled peptide, the monoclonal antibody 7E3 or integrelin (a peptide containing a KGD sequence), had little or no effect. Immunoprecipitation of procaspase-3 followed by treatment with the compounds showed that procaspase-3 was activated directly by RGDS, orbofiban, xemilofiban, and by monoclonal 7E3 antibody, the latter demonstrating that compounds must enter cells to induce apoptosis through caspase activation. Integrelin had no effect. Binding studies with H-3-SC52012B, a GPIIb/IIIa antagonist analogue of orbofiban, showed no specific binding to cardiomyocytes, but the radioligand accumulated intracellularly over 72 h. H-3-SC52012B also bound directly to human recombinant caspase-3 (K-d, 59 +/- 2 nm), and this was prevented by orbofiban, xemilofiban, and the monoclonal 7E3 antibody but not by integrelin. Finally confocal microscopy showed that RGDS co-localized with caspase-3 inside the cell. These data show that RGDS and its mimetics induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis by direct activation of procaspase-3.

Characterization of Sigma-2 Receptor-Specific Binding Sites Using [<SUP>3</SUP>H]DTG and [<SUP>125</SUP>I]RHM-4	PHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						Sigma-2 receptor; [H-3]DTG; [I-125]RHM-4; (+)-pentazocine; sigma 1R masking procedure	MEMBRANE COMPONENT 1; CLONING; AFFINITY; EXPRESSION; ANALOGS; PROTEIN; GENE	The sigma-2 receptor/transmembrane protein 97 (sigma 2R/TMRM97) is a promising biomarker of tumor proliferation and a target for cancer therapy. [H-3]DTG has been used to evaluate sigma 2R/TMEM97 binding affinity in compound development studies. However, [H-3]DTG has equal and moderate binding affinities to both sigma 1 receptor (sigma 1R) and sigma 2R/TMEM97. Furthermore, co-administration with the sigma 1R masking compound (+)-pentazocine may cause bias in sigma 2R/TMEM97 binding affinity screening experiments. We have developed a radioiodinated ligand, [I-125]RHM-4, which has high affinity and selectivity for sigma 2R/TMEM97 versus sigma 1R. In this study, a head-to-head comparison between [H-3]DTG and [I-125]RHM-4 on the binding affinity and their effectiveness in sigma 2R/TMEM97 compound screening studies was performed. The goal of these studies was to determine if this radioiodinated ligand is a suitable replacement for [H-3]DTG for screening new sigma 2R/TMEM97 compounds. Furthermore, to delineate the binding properties of [I-125]RHM-4 to the sigma 2R/TMEM97, the structure of RHM-4 was split into two fragments. This resulted in the identification of two binding regions in the sigma 2R, the "DTG " binding site, which is responsible for binding to the sigma 2R/TMEM97, and the secondary binding site, which is responsible for high affinity and selectivity for the sigma 2R/TMEM97 versus the sigma 1R. The results of this study indicate that [I-125]RHM-4 is an improved radioligand for in vitro binding studies of the sigma 2R/TMEM97 versus [H-3]DTG.

The limited efficacy and proarrhythmic potential of the available drugs require searching for new, more effective, and safer pharmacotherapies. Studies indicate that the blockade of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors could be effective in treating heart rhythm abnormalities. In this study, we aimed to assess the antiarrhythmic and hypotensive potential of HBK-10, a novel 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine derivative, as well as its binding to the selected adrenergic receptors. Radioligand binding studies demonstrated that HBK-10 showed a high affinity for alpha(1) but not for alpha(2) or beta(1) receptors. Next, we evaluated the ability of HBK-10 to protect against an adrenaline-induced arrhythmia in rats. The compound showed potent prophylactic antiarrhythmic properties in this arrhythmia model. Notably, the compound did not show proarrhythmic potential in normotensive rats since it did not influence the ECG parameters at antiarrhythmic doses. Finally, the compound showed hypotensive properties in rats, which were not observed after coadministration with adrenaline, noradrenaline, or methoxamine, which suggests alpha(1)-adrenolytic properties of HBK-10. Our results confirm that compounds with a 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine group show a high affinity for alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and a significant antiarrhythmic effect. Given the promising results of our study, further evaluation of HBK-10 is necessary to unravel the mechanisms behind its pharmacological effects and evaluate the safety profile.

These compounds are structurally similar to miconazole, which is known to inhibit cholinesterases, protect neurons, and ameliorate cognitive decline. Herein, we aimed to reveal the potential of three nafimidone alcohol esters (5 g, 5i, and 5 k), which were previously reported for their anticonvulsant effects, against co-morbidities of epilepsy such as inflammatory and neuropathic pain, cognitive and behavioral deficits, and neuron death, and understand their roles in related pathways such as gamma-butyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor and cholinesterases using in vitro, in vivo and in silico methods. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) test was used for cytotoxicity evaluation, hippocampal slice culture assay for neuroprotection, formalin test for acute and inflammatory pain, sciatic ligation for neuropathic pain, Morris water maze and open field locomotor tasks for cognitive and behavioral deficits, radioligand binding for GABA(A) receptor affinity, spectrophotometric methods for cholinesterase inhibition in vitro, and molecular docking in silico. The compounds were non-toxic to fibroblast cells. 5 k was neuroprotective against kainic acid-induced neuron death. 5i reduced pain response of mice in both the acute and the inflammatory phases. 5i improved survival upon status epilepticus. The compounds showed no affinity to GABA(A) receptor but inhibited acetylcholinesterase, 5 k also inhibited butyrylcholinesterase. The compounds were predicted to interact mainly with the peripheric anionic site of cholinesterase enzymes. The title compounds showed neuroprotective, analgesic, and cholinesterase inhibitory effects, thus they bear promise against certain co-morbidities of epilepsy with neurological insults.

The rates of cannabis misuse have been increasing. Therefore, understanding the effects of cannabis use on the brain is important. Adolescent and adult rodents exposed to repeated administration of cannabinoids show persistent microstructural changes in the hippocampus both pre- and post-synaptically. Whether similar alterations exist in human cannabis users, has not yet been demonstrated in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]UCB-J, a radioligand for the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A), were used to study hippocampal synaptic integrity in vivo in an equal number (n = 12) of subjects with DSM-5 cannabis use disorder (CUD) and matched healthy controls (HC). Arterial sampling was used to measure plasma input function. [11C]UCB-J binding potential (BPND) was estimated using a one-tissue (1T) compartment model with centrum semiovale as the reference region. Hippocampal function was assessed using a verbal memory task. Relative to HCs, CUDs showed significantly lower [C-11]UCB-JBP(ND)in the hippocampus (similar to 10%, p = 0.008, effect size 1.2) and also performed worse on the verbal memory task. These group differences in hippocampalBP(ND)persisted after correction for volume differences (p = 0.013), and correction for both age and volume (p = 0.03). We demonstrate, for the first time, in vivo evidence of lower hippocampal synaptic density in cannabis use disorder. These results are consistent with the microstructural findings from experimental studies with cannabinoids in animals, and studies of hippocampal macrostructure in human with CUD. Whether the lower hippocampal synaptic density resolves with abstinence warrants further study.

Kinetic Modelling of [<SUP>68</SUP>Ga]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 in Porcine Osteomyelitis and Soft Tissue Infections	MOLECULES			English	Article						kinetic analysis; Siglec-9; gallium-68; vascular adhesion protein; VAP-1; infection; inflammation; osteomyelitis; animal model; Staphylococcus aureus	VASCULAR ADHESION PROTEIN-1; BRAIN TRANSFER CONSTANTS; GRAPHICAL EVALUATION; C-11-METHIONINE; INFLAMMATION; F-18-FDG; GA-68-CITRATE; C-11-PK11195; SIGLEC-9; VAP-1	Background: [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 is a positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand for vascular adhesion protein 1 (VAP-1), a protein involved in leukocyte trafficking. The tracer facilitates the imaging of inflammation and infection. Here, we studied the pharmacokinetic modelling of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 in osteomyelitis and soft tissue infections in pigs. Methods: Eight pigs with osteomyelitis and soft tissue infections in the right hind limb were dynamically PET scanned for 60 min along with arterial blood sampling. The fraction of radioactivity in the blood accounted for by the parent tracer was evaluated with radio-high-performance liquid chromatography. One- and two-tissue compartment models were used for pharmacokinetic evaluation. Post-mortem soft tissue samples from one pig were analysed with anti-VAP-1 immunofluorescence. In each analysis, the animal's non-infected left hind limb was used as a control. Results: Tracer uptake was elevated in soft tissue infections but remained low in osteomyelitis. The kinetics of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 followed a reversible 2-tissue compartment model. The tracer metabolized quickly; however, taking this into account, produced more ambiguous results. Infected soft tissue samples showed endothelial cell surface expression of the Siglec-9 receptor VAP-1. Conclusion: The kinetics of [Ga-68]Ga-DOTA-Siglec-9 uptake in porcine soft tissue infections are best described by the 2-tissue compartment model.

GRPR expression is higher in early stages while PSMA expression increases with progression. The possibility of targeting both markers with a single theranostics radiotracer could improve patient management. Three GRPR/PSMA-targeting bispecific heterodimers (urea derivative PSMA-617 and bombesin-based antagonist RM26 linked via X-triazolyl-Tyr-PEG2, X = PEG2 (BO530), (CH2)(8) (BO535), none (BO536)) were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Peptides were radio-iodinated and evaluated in vitro for binding specificity, cellular retention, and affinity. In vivo specificity for all heterodimers was studied in PC-3 (GRPR-positive) and LNCaP (PSMA-positive) xenografts. [I-125]I-BO530 was evaluated in PC-3pip (GRPR/PSMA-positive) xenografts. Micro single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (microSPECT/CT) scans were acquired. The heterodimers were radiolabeled with high radiochemical yields, bound specifically to both targets, and demonstrated high degree of activity retention in PC-3pip cells. Only [I-125]I-BO530 demonstrated in vivo specificity to both targets. A biodistribution study of [I-125]I-BO530 in PC-3pip xenografted mice showed high tumor activity uptake (30%-35%ID/g at 3 h post injection (pi)).

Cessation of anti-VLA-4 therapy in a focal rat model of multiple sclerosis causes an increase in neuroinflammation	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						Multiple sclerosis; Anti-VLA-4; EAE; Positron emission tomography; TSPO; [F-18]GE-180	NATALIZUMAB DISCONTINUATION; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; PET; TSPO; MS; DISEASE; IMMUNE; RADIOTRACERS; FINGOLIMOD; ANTIBODIES	BackgroundPositron emission tomography (PET) can be used for in vivo evaluation of the pathology associated with multiple sclerosis. We investigated the use of longitudinal PET imaging and the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) binding radioligand [F-18]GE-180 to detect changes in a chronic multiple sclerosis-like focal delayed-type hypersensitivity experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (fDTH-EAE) rat model during and after anti-VLA-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment. Thirty days after lesion activation, fDTH-EAE rats were treated with the anti-VLA-4 mAb (n=4) or a control mAb (n=4; 5mg/kg, every third day, subcutaneously) for 31days. Animals were imaged with [F-18]GE-180 on days 30, 44, 65, 86 and 142. Another group of animals (n=4) was used for visualisation the microglia with Iba-1 at day 44 after a 2-week treatment period.ResultsAfter a 2-week treatment period on day 44, there was a declining trend (p=0.067) in [F-18]GE-180-binding in the anti-VLA-4 mAb-treated animals versus controls. However, cessation of treatment for 4days after a 31-day treatment period increased [F-18]GE-180 binding in animals treated with anti-VLA-4 mAb compared to the control group (p=0.0003). There was no difference between the groups in TSPO binding by day 142.ConclusionsThese results demonstrated that cessation of anti-VLA-4 mAb treatment for 4days caused a transient rebound increase in neuroinflammation. This highlights the usefulness of serial TSPO imaging in the fDTH-EAE model to better understand the rebound phenomenon.	[Vainio, S.

The 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> Receptor (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R) Regulates Impulsive Action and Cocaine Cue Reactivity in Male Sprague-Dawley Rats	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							INVERSE AGONIST; ATTENTIONAL BIAS; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; SEROTONIN; ACTIVATION; SUBSTANCE; PIMAVANSERIN; RADIOLIGAND; ANTAGONISTS	Impulsivity and the attentional orienting response to cocaine-associated cues (cue reactivity) promote relapse in cocaine-use disorder (CUD). A time-dependent escalation of cue reactivity (incubation) occurs during extended, forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration in rats. The investigational serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR) antagonist/inverse agonist M100907 suppresses impulsive action, or the inability to withhold premature responses, and cocaine-seeking behaviors. The present preclinical study was designed to establish the potential for repurposing the Food and Drug Administration-approved selective 5-HT2AR antagonist/inverse agonist pimavanserin as a therapeutic agent to forestall relapse vulnerability in CUD. In male Sprague-Dawley rats, pimavanserin suppressed impulsive action (premature responses) measured in the 1-choice serial reaction time (1-CSRT) task, similarly to M100907. We also used the 1-CSRT task to establish baseline levels of impulsive action before cocaine self-administration and evaluation of cue reactivity (lever presses reinforced by the discrete cue complex previously paired with cocaine delivery). We observed an incubation of cocaine cue reactivity between day 1 and day 30 of forced abstinence from cocaine self-administration. Baseline levels of impulsive action predicted incubated levels of cocaine cue reactivity in late abstinence. We also found that baseline impulsive action predicted the effectiveness of pimavanserin to suppress incubated cue reactivity in late abstinence from cocaine self-administration at doses that were ineffective in early abstinence. These data suggest that integration of clinical measures of impulsive action may inform refined, personalized pharmacotherapeutic intervention for the treatment of relapse vulnerability in CUD.

Prompted by this imidazo[1,2-alpha]pyridine analogues were synthesized and evaluated for their adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptor affinity via radioligand binding studies and subjected to a GTP shift assay to determine its adenosine A(1) receptor agonistic or antagonistic functionality. Imidazo[1,2-alpha]pyridine, the parent scaffold, was found devoid of affinity for the adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors. The influence of substitution on position C2 showed no improvement for either adenosine A(1) or A(2A) receptor affinity. The addition of an amino or a cyclohexylamino group to position C3 also showed no improvement of adenosine A(1) or A(2A) receptor affinity. Surprisingly para-substitution on the phenyl ring at position C2 in combination with a cyclohexylamino group at position C3 led to adenosine A(1) receptor affinity in the low micromolar range with compound 4d showing: (1) the highest affinity for the adenosine A(1) receptor with a K-i value of 2.06 mu M and (2) adenosine A(1) receptor antagonistic properties. This pilot study concludes that para-substituted 3-cyclohexylamino-2-phenyl-imidazo[1,2-alpha]pyridine analogues represent an interesting scaffold to investigate further structure-activity relationships in the design of novel imidazo[1,2-alpha]pyridine-based adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.

Charles			Optimized Translocator Protein Ligand for Optical Molecular Imaging and Screening	BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; TSPO-PET LIGAND; IN-VITRO; FLUORESCENT-PROBE; BINDING-SITES; CANCER; EXPRESSION; RADIOLIGAND; BREAST; VIVO	Translocator protein (TSPO) is a validated target for molecular imaging of a variety of human diseases and disorders. Given its involvement in cholesterol metabolism, TSPO expression is commonly elevated in solid tumors, including glioma, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer. TSPO ligands capable of detection by optical imaging are useful molecular tracers for a variety of purposes that range from quantitative biology to drug discovery. Leveraging our prior optimization of the pyrazolopyrimidine TSPO ligand scaffold for cancer imaging, we report herein a new generation of TSPO tracers with superior binding affinity and suitability for optical imaging and screening. In total, seven candidate TSPO tracers were synthesized and vetted in this study; the most promising tracer identified (29, K-d = 0.19 nM) was the result of conjugating a high-affinity TSPO ligand to a fluorophore used routinely in biological sciences (FITC) via a functional carbon linker of optimal length. Computational modeling suggested that an n-alkyl linker of eight carbons in length allows for positioning of the bulky fluorophore distal to the ligand binding domain and toward the solvent interface, minimizing potential ligand-protein interference. Probe 29 was found to be highly suitable for in vitro imaging of live TSPO-expressing cells and could be deployed as a ligand screening and discovery tool. Competitive inhibition of probe 29 quantified by fluorescence and H-3-PK11195 quantified by traditional radiometric detection resulted in equivalent affinity data for two previously reported TSPO ligands. This study introduces the utility of TSPO ligand 29 for in vitro imaging and screening and provides a structural basis for the development of future TSPO imaging ligands bearing bulky signaling moieties.

Compared with the use of agonists, allosteric potentiators offer potential advantages such as temporal, regional, and phasic potentiation of natural signaling, and that of receptor subtype selectivity. We report the identification of a stereoselective interaction of a benzothiazol racemic compound that acts as a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the rat and human dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. The R isomer did not directly stimulate the dopamine D2 receptor but potentiated the effects of dopamine. In contrast the S isomer attenuated the effects of the PAM and the effects of dopamine. In radioligand binding studies, these compounds do not compete for binding of orthosteric ligands, but indeed the R isomer increased the number of high-affinity sites for [H-3]-dopamine without affecting K-d. We went on to identify a more potent PAM for use in native receptor systems. This compound potentiated the effects of D2/D3 signaling in vitro in electrophysiologic studies on dissociated striatal neurons and in vivo on the effects of L-dopa in the 6OHDA (6-hydroxydopamine) contralateral turning model. These PAMs lacked activity at a wide variety of receptors, lacked PAM activity at related Gi-coupled G protein-coupled receptors, and lacked activity at D1 receptors. However, the PAMs did potentiate [H-3]-dopamine binding at both D2 and D3 receptors. Together, these studies show that we have identified PAMs of the D2 and D3 receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Such compounds may have utility in the treatment of hypodopaminergic function.

A good linear correlation (r(2) = 0.771) between the calculated IC50 values and their polar surface area was found, suggesting that this is an important structural feature for its activity. The radioligand competition results indicate that (+/-)-18-MC and (-)-ibogaine partially inhibit [H-3]imipramine binding by an allosteric mechanism. Molecular docking, molecular dynamics, and in silico mutation results suggest that protonated (-)-18-MC binds to luminal [i.e., beta 4-Phe255 (phenylalanine/valine ring; position 13'), and alpha 3-Leu250 and beta 4-Leu251 (leucine ring; position 9')], non-luminal, and intersubunit sites. The pharmacophore model suggests that nitrogens from the ibogamine core as well as methylamino, hydroxyl, and methoxyl moieties at position 18 form hydrogen bonds. Collectively our data indicate that coronaridine congeners inhibit h alpha 3 beta 4 AChRs by blocking the ion channel's lumen and probably by additional negative allosteric mechanisms by interacting with a series of non-luminal sites.

Beer self-administration provokes lateralized nucleus accumbens dopamine release in male heavy drinkers	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Ventral striatum; Mesolimbic; Alcoholism; Conditioned response; Cue reactivity; Reward; Operant; Alcohol abuse; Instrumental conditioning; Alcohol seeking	INCENTIVE-SENSITIZATION THEORY; FREELY MOVING RATS; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; SEEKING BEHAVIOR; ALCOHOL RESEARCH; COCAINE-SEEKING; FAMILY-HISTORY; ORAL ALCOHOL; DRUG-SEEKING	Although striatal dopamine (DA) is important in alcohol abuse, the nature of DA release during actual alcohol drinking is unclear, since drinking includes self-administration of both conditioned flavor stimuli (CS) of the alcoholic beverage and subsequent intoxication, the unconditioned stimulus (US). Here, we used a novel self-administration analog to distinguish nucleus accumbens (NAcc) DA responses specific to the CS and US. Right-handed male heavy drinkers (n = 26) received three positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the D-2/D-3 radioligand [C-11]raclopride (RAC) and performed a pseudo self-administration task that separately administered a flavor CS of either a habitually consumed beer or the appetitive control GatoradeA (R), concomitant with the US of ethanol intoxication (0.06 g/dL intravenous (IV) administration) or IV saline. Scan conditions were Gatorade flavor + saline (Gat&Sal), Gatorade flavor + ethanol (Gat&Eth), and beer flavor + ethanol (Beer&Eth). Ethanol (US) reduced RAC binding (inferring DA release) in the left (L) NAcc [Gat&Sal > Gat&Eth]. Beer flavor (CS) increased DA in the right (R) NAcc [Gat&Eth > Beer&Eth]. The combination of beer flavor and ethanol (CS + US), [Gat&Sal > Beer&Eth], induced DA release in bilateral NAcc. Self-reported intoxication during scanning correlated with L NAcc DA release. Relative to saline, infusion of ethanol increased alcoholic drink wanting. Our findings suggest lateralized DA function in the NAcc, with L NAcc DA release most reflecting intoxication, R NAcc DA release most reflecting the flavor CS, and the conjoint CS + US producing a bilateral NAcc response.

Recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB) reduces Parkinsonian symptoms and increases dopamine transporter (DAT) binding in several animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Effects of rhPDGF-BB are the result of proliferation of ventricular wall progenitor cells and reversed by blocking mitosis. Based on these restorative effects, we assessed the safety and tolerability of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) rhPDGF-BB administration in individuals with PD. METHODS. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase I/IIa study at two clinical centers in Sweden. Twelve patients with moderate PD received rhPDGF-BB via an implanted drug infusion pump and an investigational i.c.v. catheter. Patients were assigned to a dose cohort (0.2, 1.5, or 5 mu g rhPDGF-BB per day) and then randomized to active treatment or placebo (3:1) for a 12-day treatment period. The primary objective was to assess safety and tolerability of i.c.v.-delivered rhPDGF-BB. Secondary outcome assessments included several clinical rating scales and changes in DAT binding. The follow-up period was 85 days. RESULTS. All patients completed the study. There were no unresolved adverse events. Serious adverse events occurred in three patients; however, these were unrelated to rhPDGF-BB administration. Secondary outcome parameters did not show dose-dependent changes in clinical rating scales, but there was a positive effect on DAT binding in the right putamen. CONCLUSION. At all doses tested, i.c.v. administration of rhPDGF-BB was well tolerated. Results support further clinical development of rhPDGF-BB for patients with PD.

Variants within the corresponding genes ADORAI and ADORA2A were shown associated with pathophysiologic alterations, particularly increased anxiety. It is unknown so far, if these variants might modulate the A(I)AR distribution and availability in different brain regions. In this pilot study, the influence of ADORAI and ADORA2A variants on in vivo AAR binding was assessed with the A(I)AR-selective positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand [F-18]CPFPX in brains of healthy humans. Twenty-eight normal control subjects underwent PET procedures to calculate the binding potential BPND of [F-18]CPFPX in cerebral regions and to assess ADORAI and ADORA2A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) effects on regional MIND data. Our results revealed SNPs of both genes associated with [F-18]CPFPX binding to the AAR. The strongest effects that withstood even Bonferroni correction of multiple SNP testing were found in nonsmoking subjects (N =22) for ADORA2A SNPs rs2236624 and rs5751876 (corr. P-all <0.05). SNP alleles previously identified at risk for increased anxiety like the rs5751876 T-allele corresponded to consistently higher A(I)AR availability in all brain regions. Our data indicate for the first time that variation of A(I)AR availability was associated with ADORA SNPs. The finding of increased A(I)AR availability in regions of the fear network, particularly in ADORA2A risk allele carriers, strongly warrants evaluation and replication in further studies including individuals with increased anxiety.

A Functional Monomer Is Not Enough: Principal Component Analysis of the Influence of Template Complexation in Pre-Polymerization Mixtures on Imprinted Polymer Recognition and Morphology	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						molecularly imprinted polymer; molecular dynamics; molecular recognition; molecular imprinting; principal component analysis; chemometrics	SOLID-PHASE EXTRACTION; MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS; CHIRAL RESOLUTION; DESIGN; OPTIMIZATION; SELECTIVITY; ADSORPTION; INSIGHT; NETWORK; AMETRYN	In this report, principal component analysis (PCA) has been used to explore the influence of template complexation in the pre-polymerization phase on template molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) recognition and polymer morphology. A series of 16 bupivacaine MIPs were studied. The ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA)-crosslinked polymers had either methacrylic acid (MAA) or methyl methacrylate (MMA) as the functional monomer, and the stoichiometry between template, functional monomer and crosslinker was varied. The polymers were characterized using radioligand equilibrium binding experiments, gas sorption measurements, swelling studies and data extracted from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of all-component pre-polymerization mixtures. The molar fraction of the functional monomer in the MAA-polymers contributed to describing both the binding, surface area and pore volume. Interestingly, weak positive correlations between the swelling behavior and the rebinding characteristics of the MAA-MIPs were exposed. Polymers prepared with MMA as a functional monomer and a polymer prepared with only EGDMA were found to share the same characteristics, such as poor rebinding capacities, as well as similar surface area and pore volume, independent of the molar fraction MMA used in synthesis. The use of PCA for interpreting relationships between MD-derived descriptions of events in the pre-polymerization mixture, recognition properties and morphologies of the corresponding polymers illustrates the potential of PCA as a tool for better understanding these complex materials and for their rational design.

First generation CB1R antagonists/inverse agonists such as rimonabant and taranabant exhibited severe CNS side effects such as anxiety and depression, which are considered to be related to the compounds' ability to access central CB1R. Recently, several compounds have been developed as second generation antagonists with a profile of restriction to peripheral CB1R. We evaluated the distribution of TM38837, a second generation CB1R antagonist, using brain and whole body PET in three cynomolgus monkeys, and established the relationship between CB1R occupancy and dose/plasma concentration of TM38837 in comparison with rimonabant. A brain PET study was performed using [C-11]MePPEP, a PET radioligand for CB1R, to evaluate the brain CB1R occupancy of TM38837 at various plasma concentrations in comparison with rimonabant at known efficacious plasma concentrations. A whole body PET study was performed to investigate the change of peripheral distribution of [C-11]MePPEP by TM38837 administration, which indirectly estimated the effects to the peripheral CB1R by TM38837. CB1R occupancy by both TM38837 and rimonabant increased in a dose/plasma concentration-dependent manner. However, in vivo affinity by plasma level was more than 100 times lower for TM38837. Peripherally, [C-11]MePPEP accumulation decreased in gall bladder and brown adipose tissue by TM38837 administration. TM38837 showed rather lower CB1R occupancy than rimonabant at the expected therapeutic plasma level, which is expected to reduce CNS side effects in clinical situations.

Effects of repeated treatment with the dopamine D2/D3 receptor partial agonist aripiprazole on striatal D2/D3 receptor availability in monkeys	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						PET imaging; Behavior; Dopamine receptors; Monkeys	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUG; D2 RECEPTORS; FRONTAL METABOLISM; COCAINE DEPENDENCE; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; HUMAN-BRAIN; PET; TOLERABILITY; OCCUPANCY	Chronic treatment with dopamine (DA) receptor agonists and antagonists can differentially affect measures of DA D2/D3 receptor number and function, but the effects of chronic treatment with a partial D2/D3 receptor agonist are not clear. We used a within-subjects design in male cynomolgus monkeys to determine the effects of repeated (17-day) treatment with the D2/D3 receptor partial agonist aripiprazole (ARI; 0.03 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg i.m.) on food-reinforced behavior (n = 5) and on D2/D3 receptor availability as measured with positron emission tomography (PET; n = 9). Five monkeys responded under a fixed-ratio 50 schedule of food reinforcement and D2/D3 receptor availability was measured before and 4 days after ARI treatment using PET and the D2/D3 receptor-selective radioligand [F-18]fluoroclebopride (FCP). Four additional monkeys were studied using [C-11]raclopride and treated sequentially with each dose of ARI for 17 days. ARI decreased food-maintained responding with minimal evidence of tolerance. Repeated ARI administration increased FCP and raclopride distribution volume ratios (DVRs) in the caudate nucleus and putamen in most monkeys, but decreases were observed in monkeys with the highest baseline DVRs. The results indicate that repeated treatment with a low-efficacy DA receptor partial agonist produces effects on brain D2/D3 receptor availability that are qualitatively different from those of both high-efficacy receptor agonists and antagonists, and suggest that the observed individual differences in response to ARI treatment may reflect its partial agonist activity.

Development of operational models of receptor activation including constitutive receptor activity and their use to determine the efficacy of the chemokine CCL17 at the CC chemokine receptor CCR4	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						operational model; CCR4; agonist efficacy; intrinsic efficacy; CCL17; CCL22; T-lymphocyte; chemokine receptor	AFFINITY; AGONISTS; EXPRESSION; PROTEINS; CYCLASE; LIGAND; CELLS; FULL	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The operational model provides a key conceptual framework for the analysis of pharmacological data. However, this model does not include constitutive receptor activity, a frequent phenomenon in modern pharmacology, particularly in recombinant systems. Here, we developed extensions of the operational model which include constitutive activity and applied them to effects of agonists at the chemokine receptor CCR4. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The effects of agonists of CCR4 on [35S]GTP?S binding to recombinant cell membranes and on the filamentous (F-) actin content of human CD4+ CCR4+ T cells were determined. The basal [35S]GTP?S binding was changed by varying the GDP concentration whilst the basal F-actin contents of the higher expressing T cell populations were elevated, suggesting constitutive activity of CCR4. Both sets of data were analysed using the mathematical models. RESULTS The affinity of CCL17 (also known as TARC) derived from analysis of the T cell data (pKa= 9.61 +/- 0.17) was consistent with radioligand binding experiments (9.50 +/- 0.11) while that from the [35S]GTP?S binding experiments was lower (8.27 +/- 0.09). Its intrinsic efficacy differed between the two systems (110 in T cells vs. 11). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The presence of constitutive receptor activity allows the absolute intrinsic efficacy of agonists to be determined without a contribution from the signal transduction system. Intrinsic efficacy estimated in this way is consistent with Furchgott's definition of this property. CCL17 may have a higher intrinsic efficacy at CCR4 in human T cells than that expressed recombinantly in CHO cells.	[Slack, R. J.; Hall, D.

Traditionally, the plant has been used as a sedative for the treatment of insomnia and other mental disorders. Background information of this plant has encouraged us to investigate its antiamnesic activity in rat. Objective: Standardized ethanol extract of M. minuta was investigated for their putative role in learning and memory performance in normal and amnesic rats. Materials and methods: Ethanol extract of M. minuta (EMM) was standardized for marsiline using HPLC. The effect of standardized extract of M. minuta (1.15% w/w marsiline) was tested in amnesic rat using elevated plus maze (EPM) and passive avoidance (PA) test. Amnesia was induced after scopolamine (1 mg/kg, s.c.) and electroconvulsive shock (150 mA, 0.2 s) treatment. Behavioral studies were further substantiated with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and radioligand muscarinic receptor binding studies in rat brain regions. Results: Oral administration of EMM at 200 and 400 mg/kg/day for 3 days significantly reversed the amnesia whereas, no per se effect was observed. In comparison to control, AChE activity in frontal cortex and hippocampus was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited by EMM. EMM at doses 200 and 400 mg/kg has significantly (P < 0.05) increased (+34 % and +40 % change in affinity, respectively) the binding of 3H-QNB in frontal cortex indicating the up regulation of the muscarinic receptors. Discussion and conclusion: These findings suggest that standardized extract of M. minuta have excellent antiamnesic activity, probably mediating through central cholinergic system.

Radiation dose estimates for carbon-11-labelled PET tracers	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Dosimetry; [11C]; Positron emission tomography (PET); Radiotracer; Ionising radiation	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PERSONAL-COMPUTER SOFTWARE; WHOLE-BODY; RECEPTOR RADIOLIGAND; DOSIMETRY; BIODISTRIBUTION; BRAIN; LIGAND; MONKEY; C-11-PIB	Introduction: Carbon-11-labelled positron emission tomography (PET) tracers commonly used in biomedical research expose subjects to ionising radiation. Dosimetry is the measurement of radiation dose, but also commonly refers to the estimation of health risk associated with ionising radiation. This review describes radiation dosimetry of carbon-11-labelled molecules in the context of current PET research and the most widely used regulatory guidelines. Methods: A MEDLINE literature search returned 42 articles; 32 of these were based on human PET data dealing with radiation dosimetry of carbon-11 molecules. Radiation burden expressed as effective dose and maximum absorbed organ dose was compared between tracers. Results: All but one of the carbon-11-labelled PET tracers have an effective dose under 9 mu Sv/MBq, with a mean of 5.9 mu Sv/MBq. Data show that serial PET scans in a single subject are feasible for the majority of radiotracers. Conclusion: Although differing in approach, the two most widely used regulatory frameworks (those in the USA and the EU) do not differ substantially with regard to the maximum allowable injected activity per PET study. The predictive validity of animal dosimetry models is critically discussed in relation to human dosimetry. Finally, empirical PET data are related to human dose estimates based on homogenous distribution, generic models and maximum cumulated activities. Despite the contribution of these models to general risk estimation, human dosimetry studies are recommended where continued use of a new PET tracer is foreseen. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

This study assessed pharmacological properties of empagliflozin in vitro and pharmacokinetic properties in vivo and compared its potency and selectivity with other SGLT-2 inhibitors. Methods: [C-14]-alpha-methyl glucopyranoside (AMG) uptake experiments were performed with stable cell lines over-expressing human (h) SGLT-1, 2 and 4. Two new cell lines over-expressing hSGLT-5 and hSGLT-6 were established and [C-14]-mannose and [C-14]-myo-inositol uptake assays developed. Binding kinetics were analysed using a radioligand binding assay with [H-3]-labelled empagliflozin and HEK293-hSGLT-2 cell membranes. Acute in vivo assessment of pharmacokinetics was performed with normoglycaemic beagle dogs and Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats. Results: Empagliflozin has an IC50 of 3.1 nM for hSGLT-2. Its binding to SGLT-2 is competitive with glucose (half-life approximately 1 h). Compared with other SGLT-2 inhibitors, empagliflozin has a high degree of selectivity over SGLT-1, 4, 5 and 6. Species differences in SGLT-1 selectivity were identified. Empagliflozin pharmacokinetics in ZDF rats were characterised by moderate total plasma clearance (CL) and bioavailability (BA), while in beagle dogs CL was low and BA was high. Conclusions: Empagliflozin is a potent and competitive SGLT-2 inhibitor with an excellent selectivity profile and the highest selectivity window of the tested SGLT-2 inhibitors over hSGLT-1. Empagliflozin represents an innovative therapeutic approach to treat diabetes.	[Grempler, R.; Thomas, L.; Bakker, R.

Two closely related VMATs with distinct pharmacological properties and tissue distributions have been characterized. VMAT1 is preferentially expressed in neuroendocrine cells and VMAT2 is primarily expressed in the CNS. The neurotoxicity and addictive properties of various psychostimulants have been attributed, at least partly, to their interference with VMAT2 functions. The quantitative assessment of the VMAT2 density by PET scanning has been clinically useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of the progression of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases and drug addiction. The classical VMAT2 inhibitor, tetrabenazine, has long been used for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington's disease in the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, and recently approved in the United States. The VMAT2 imaging may also be useful for exploiting the onset of diabetes mellitus, as VMAT2 is also expressed in the beta-cells of the pancreas. VMAT1 gene SLC18A1 is a locus with strong evidence of linkage with schizophrenia and, thus, the polymorphic forms of the VMAT1 gene may confer susceptibility to schizophrenia. This review summarizes the current understanding of the structure-function relationships of VMAT2, and the role of VMAT2 on addiction and psychostimulant-induced neurotoxicity, and the therapeutic and diagnostic applications of specific VMAT2 ligands. The evidence for the linkage of VMAT1 gene with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder I is also discussed. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Considering the role of glucocorticoid hormones in the systemic reaction against stress and in pathogenesis of depression, the aim of the present work was to study gender-related differences in glucocorticoid signaling and in response of this system to a typical antidepressant drug, imipramine. Gender-related differences in glucocorticoid receptor functional properties were assessed using hepatic and renal whole cell extracts of female and male rats before and after long-term imipramine treatment. The receptor's hormone-binding parameters, B-max and K-D, were determined by radioligand binding assay, the glucocorticoid receptor and heat shock proteins (Hsp70 and Hsp90) levels by quantitative immunoblotting, and the interaction of these proteins within glucocorticoid receptor heterocomplex by co-immunoprecipitation. Glucocorticoid receptor binding potency (B-max/K-D ratio) was significantly higher in males than females both before and after treatment with imipramine. Gender-specific changes in the glucocorticoid receptor binding parameters in the examined tissues were observed in response to imipramine, and were found to be associated with alterations in the receptor interaction with Hsp70 and Hsp90. The results of the study point to sexual dimorphism in the glucocorticoid signaling and imply that glucocorticoid receptor functional alterations contribute to gender-related differences in vulnerability to stress and stress-related disorders, and in response to antidepressant drugs.

J	Olianas, MC; Dedoni, S; Ambu, R; Onali, P				Olianas, Maria C.; Dedoni, Simona; Ambu, Rossano; Onali, Pierluigi			Agonist activity of N-desmethylclozapine at δ-opioid receptors of human frontal cortex	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						N-desmethylclozapine; delta-opioid receptor; Receptor binding; G protein activation; Cyclic AMP; Human frontal cortex	CHILDHOOD-ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; CLOZAPINE METABOLITE; COMMON PROPERTY; MOOD DISORDERS; MICE DEFICIENT; HUMAN BRAIN; BINDING; RATS; PHARMACOKINETICS	The clozapine metabolite N-desmethylclozapine (NDMC) has been recently shown to act at different neurotransmitter receptors and to display both antagonist and agonist activities. We have previously reported that in cells over-expressing the recombinant delta-opioid receptor NDMC behaved as partial agonist with high intrinsic activity, but its action at the receptors naturally expressed in human brain remained to be investigated. In the present study, we examined whether NDMC was able to bind to and activate delta-opioid receptors in membranes of post-mortem human frontal cortex. In radioligand binding assays, NDMC competition curves displayed high- (K-i = 26 nM) and low-affinity (K-i = 3 mu M) components, whose proportion was regulated by guanine nucleotides in an agonist-like fashion. In functional assays, NDMC stimulated [S-35] GTP gamma S binding (EC50 = 905 nM) and inhibited cyclic AMP formation (EC50 = 590 nM) as effectively as delta-opioid agonists, whereas clozapine was much less potent and efficacious and clozapine N-oxide was completely inactive. The NDMC agonist activity was potently antagonized by the delta-opioid antagonist naltrindole, but not by the mu-opioid receptor antagonist CTAP (D-phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2) or the kappa-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. Moreover, blockade of either acetylcholine muscarinic, dopamine D-2 or serotonin 5HT(1A) receptors failed to affect NDMC agonist activity. These data demonstrate that at clinically relevant concentrations NDMC behaves as an efficacious agonist at delta-opioid receptors of human frontal cortex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AEA reversibly inhibited Rb-86(+) efflux induced by 300 mu M ACh with an IC50 value of 0.9 +/- 2 mu M. Pre-treatment with the cannabinoid (CB1) receptor antagonist SR141716A (1 mu M), the CB2 receptor antagonist SR144528 (1 mu M), or pertussis toxin (0.2 mg/mL) did not alter the inhibitory effects of AEA, suggesting that known CB receptors are not involved in AEA inhibition of nAChRs. AEA inhibition of Rb-86(+) efflux was not reversed by increasing acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations. In radioligand binding studies, the specific binding of [H-3]-nicotine was not altered in the presence of AEA, indicating that AEA inhibits the function of nAChR in a non-competitive manner. Neither the amidohydrolase inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mM) nor the cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, (5 mu M) affected AEA inhibition of nAChRs, suggesting that the effect of AEA is not mediated by its metabolic products. Importantly, the extent of AEA inhibition of Rb-86(+) efflux was significantly attenuated by the absence of 1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin pre-treatment, supporting previous findings that fatty acid-like compounds modulate the activity of nAChRs. Collectively, the results indicate that AEA inhibits the function of nAChRs in thalamic synaptosomes via a CB-independent mechanism and that the background activity of these receptors is affected by fatty acids and AEA.

Novel analogs and stereoisomers of the marine toxin neodysiherbaine with specificity for kainate receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							SELECTIVE NONCOMPETITIVE ANTAGONISTS; EXCITATORY AMINO-ACID; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; 2-ARYLUREIDOBENZOIC ACIDS; IN-VITRO; GLUR5; DYSIHERBAINE; SUBUNIT; PHYSIOLOGY; RESIDUES	Antagonists for kainate receptors (KARs), a family of glutamate-gated ion channels, are efficacious in a number of animal models of neuropathologies, including epilepsy, migraine pain, and anxiety. To produce molecules with novel selectivities for kainate receptors, we generated three sets of analogs related to the natural marine convulsant neodysiherbaine (neoDH), and we characterized their pharmacological profiles. Radioligand displacement assays with recombinant alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and KARs demonstrated that functional groups at two positions on the neoDH molecule are critical pharmacological determinants; only binding to the glutamate receptor (GluR)5-2a subunit was relatively insensitive to structural modifications of the critical functional groups. NeoDH analogs in which the L-glutamate congener was disrupted by epimerization retained low affinity for GluR5-2a and GluR6a KAR subunits. Most of the analogs showed agonist activity in electrophysiological recordings from human embryonic kidney-T/17 cells expressing GluR5-2a KARs, similar to the natural convulsant neoDH. In contrast, 2,4-epi-neoDH inhibited glutamate currents evoked from both GluR5-2a and GluR6a receptor-expressing cells. Therefore, this compound represents the first compound to exhibit functional antagonist activity on GluR5-2a and GluR6a KAR subunits without concurrent activity on AMPA receptor subunits. Finally, binding affinity of the synthetic ligands for the GluR5-2a subunit closely correlated with their seizurogenic potency, strongly supporting a role for receptors containing this subunit in the convulsant reaction to KAR agonists. The analogs described here offer further insight into structural determinants of ligand selectivity for KARs and potentially represent useful pharmacological tools for studying the role of KARs in synaptic physiology and pathology.

Therefore, AChE has been an attractive target for the diagnosis of AD. In the present study, 5,7-dihydro-3-[2-(1-(phenyimethyl)-4piperidinyl)ethyl]-6H-pyrrolo[3,2-f]-1,2-benzisoxazol-6-one (CP-118,954), a potent AChE inhibitor, was labelled with radiolodine and evaluated as an AChE imaging agent for SPECT. Methods Radioiodine-labelled CP-118,954 was prepared from CP-144,885 and [I-125]iodobenzyl bromide, and anti-AChE activities of iodine-substituted CP-118,954 were measured. Metabolism studies were carried out in samples of blood and whole brain of mice injected with 2[I-123]iodo-CP-118,954 (I-123-1). Tissue distribution studies were also performed in mice injected with I-125-1, and samples of blood, thyroid, stomach, and brain tissue (cerebellum, striatum and cortex) were removed, weighed and counted. Results Of the ligands, 2-iodo-CP-118,954 exhibited higher binding affinity for AChE (IC50 = 24 nM) than the other positional isomers. 2-[I-125]lodo-CP-118,954 was found to have a lipophilicity (log P=2.1) favouring brain permeability and metabolic stability in mouse brain, but a marginal target (striatum) to non-target (cerebellum) uptake ratio (1.1) in mouse brain. Conclusion This result demonstrates that 2-[I-125]iodo-CP-118,954 may be unsuitable for AChE imaging. These findings suggest that radioligands suitable for AChE imaging should have not only a specific structure but also a sub-nanomolar to low nanomolar IC50.

The crlRs are considered to be involved in various neurological and psychiatric diseases. [C-11]SA4503 is a recently developed radioligand with high and selective affinity for cFIRs, and we have first applied it to clinical studies. Nine healthy male subjects each underwent a dynamic 90-min PET scan after injection of [C-11]SA4503. In addition to the baseline measurement, three of the nine subjects underwent a second [C-11] SA4503-PET after partial blockade of sigma IRs by oral administration of haloperidol, a sigma receptor antagonist. Full kinetic analysis using two times nonlinear estimations was applied for fitting a two-tissue three-compartment model to determine the binding potential (BP) and total distribution volume (tDV) of [C-11]SA4503. Graphical analysis with a Logan plot was also applied for estimations of tDV. The regional distribution patterns of BP and tDV in 11 regions were compatible with those of previously reported crlRs in vitro. The reduced binding sites of sigma IRs by haloperidol were appropriately evaluated. The tDVs derived from the two methods matched each other well. The Logan plot offered images of the tDV, which reflected sigma 1R densities, and the tDV in the images decreased after haloperidol loading. Moreover, comparison of BPs calculated with and without metabolite correction for plasma input function indicated that the metabolite correction could be omitted. We concluded that this method enables the quantitative analysis of sigma 1Rs in the human brain. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Our results showed that striatal 18F-FP-CIT binding were significantly reduced to 70.9% (caudate), 46.8% (anterior putamen) and 24.0% (posterior putamen) in early PD compared with that of the control, and to 52.0%, 34.5% and 16.5% correspondingly in advanced PD, respectively. There was significant negative correlation between total motor UPDRS score of all parkinsonian patients and 18F-FP-CIT uptake in caudate nucleus (r = -0.53, p < 0.001), anterior putamen (r = -0.53, p < 0.001) and posterior putamen (r = -0.61, p < 0.001). SPM comparison of 18F-FP-CIT uptake between early or advanced PD and the control group showed significant decline in striatum, predominantly localized on the contralateral side and in the dorsal-posterior putamen. These results indicate that 18F-FP-CIT PET can serve as a suitable biomarker to represent the severity of PD in early and advanced stages.

None of the currently available radioligands for CB1 are suitable for quantitative PET, primarily because of their insufficient binding potential (BP) in brain or low penetration through the blood-brain barrier (131313). The goal of this study was to evaluate C-11-JHU75528, an analog of the selective CB1 antagonist rimonabant, in vivo as a potential CB1 radioligand for PET. Methods: The brain regional distribution and pharmacology of C-11-JHU75528 have been evaluated in vivo in mice (dissection)and baboons(PET). Results: C-11-JHU75528 readily entered the mouse and baboon brain and specifically an selectively labeled cerebral CB1 receptors. The ratio of striatum to brain stem in mice and the binding potential (BP) in the baboon putamen were 3.4 and 1.3-1.5, respectively. The specific binding of C-11-JHU75528 in vivo was blocked by preinjection of nonlabeled JHU75528. Administration of rimonabant (1 mg/kg, intravenously) also blocked the specific binding of C-11-JHU75528 in the mouse and baboon brain, whereas various central non-cannabinoid drugs did not significantly reduce the C-11-JHU75528 binding in the mouse brain. C-11-JHU75528 formed several hydrophilic metabolites, but only a minute fraction of metabolic radioactivity penetrated the BBB. Conclusion: C-11-JHU75528 holds promise as a radiotracer with suitable imaging properties for quantification of CB1 receptors in the human brain.

J	Schulz, S; Röcken, C; Schulz, S				Schulz, Solveig; Roecken, Christoph; Schulz, Stefan			Immunohistochemical detection of bombesin receptor subtypes GRP-R and BRS-3 in human tumors using novel antipeptide antibodies	VIRCHOWS ARCHIV			English	Article						bombesin; bombesin receptor; GRP-R; BRS-3; neoplasm; antibody; immunocytochemistry; western blot	GASTRIN-RELEASING-PEPTIDE; HUMAN PROSTATE; MESSENGER-RNA; ANALOG AN-215; CANCER; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION; GROWTH; IDENTIFICATION; RADIOLIGAND	Bombesin (BN)-like peptides can stimulate cancer cell growth through binding to their specific G protein-coupled receptors. It is well established that BN receptors are being overexpressed in a subset of human tumors; however, little is known about the cellular and subcellular localization of individual BN receptor subtypes in these tissues. In this study, we developed and characterized novel antipeptide antibodies to the carboxy terminal regions of the gastrin-releasing peptide-preferring bombesin receptor (GRP-R) and the bombesin receptor subtype-3 (BRS-3). Specificity of the antisera was demonstrated by (1) detection of broad bands migrating at M-r 50,000-70,000 in Western blots of membranes from receptor-expressing tissues; (2) cell surface staining of transfected cells; (3) translocation of GRP-R receptor immunostaining after BN exposure; and (4) abolition of tissue immunostaining by preadsorbtion of the antibodies with their immunizing peptides. The distribution of BN receptors was investigated in 74 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human tumors. GRP-R receptors were most frequently detected in breast and prostate carcinomas. BRS-3 receptors were often detected in prostate and pancriatic carcinomas and in pituitary adenomas. Immunoreactive GRP-R and BRS-3 receptors were in many cases predominantly confined to the plasma membrane and uniformly present on nearly all tumor cells. The development of these novel antipeptide antibodies will facilitate the identification of those tumors, which may be targets for diagnostic or radio-therapeutic application of subtype-selective BN analogs.

Thus, antagonists of this class of receptors have been postulated to be useful analgesics. Toward this end, we developed a cell-based beta-lactamase (BLA) reporter gene assay to identify small molecule antagonists of the human MRG-X1 receptor from a library of compounds. Single-cell clones expressing functional receptors were selected using the BLA reporter gene technology. The EC50 for the MRG agonist peptide, BAM 15, appeared to be comparable between the BLA assay and the intracellular Ca2+ transient assays in these cells. Ultra high-throughput screening of approximately 1 million compounds in a 1.8-mu l cell-based BLA reporter gene assay was conducted in a 3456-well plate format. Compounds exhibiting potential antagonist profile in the BLA assay were confirmed in the second messenger Ca2+ transient assay. A cell-based receptor trafficking assay was used to further validate the mechanism of action of these compounds. Several classes of compounds, particularly the 2,3-disubstituted azabicyclo-octanes, appear to be relatively potent antagonists at the human MRG-X1 receptors, as confirmed by the receptor trafficking assay and radioligand binding studies. Furthermore, the structure-activity relationship reveals that within this class of compounds, the diphenylmethyl moiety is constant at the 2-substituent, whereas the 3-substituent is directly correlated with the antagonist activity of the compound.

Design: Experimental study using athymic nude mice bearing xenografts of HEC-1A and RL-95-2 human endometrial cancers to assess the efficacy and toxicity of AN-152 and AN-207. The expression of LHRH receptors in HEC-1A and RL-95-2 cancers was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and radioligand binding assays. Setting: Experimental laboratory research. Animal(s): Female athymic nude mice (Ncr, nu/nu). Intervention(s): Animals were treated with IV injections of the cytotoxic LHRH analogues AN-152 and AN-207 and their respective cytotoxic radicals doxorubicin (DOX) and AN-201 (2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin) on a control vehicle solution. Main Outcome Measure(s): Tumor volume, final tumor weight, tumor doubling time, body weight, white blood cell count. and LHRH receptor expression. Result(s): AN-152 significantly inhibited the growth of HEC-1A tumors. AN-207 also significantly suppressed the proliferation in vivo of HEC-1A and RL-95-2 cancers. The cytotoxic radicals DOX and AN-201 had no effect. Furthermore. mRNA for LHRH receptors, LHRH receptor protein, and high-affinity binding sites for LHRH were demonstrated on tumors. Conclusion(s): Targeted chemotherapy with AN-152 and AN-207 strongly inhibits the growth of human endometrial cancers, which express LHRH receptors, and could provide a new treatment modality for women with advanced endometrial carcinoma.

Eight novel diastereomeric compounds in this peptide family were designed, prepared, and tested biologically to gain structure-activity relationship information. The new multisubstituted tetrapeptide analogs contain both a 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine residue at the N-terminus and P-methyl-cyclohexylalanine at the third position as replacements for the original first tyrosine and the third phenylalanine, respectively. These derivatives wear either free acidic (-COOH) or amidated (-CONH2) C-terminal. The potency and delta- versus mu-opioid receptor selectivity were evaluated by in vitro radioreceptor-binding assays, while the intrinsic G-protein-activating efficacy of these analogs was tested in [S-35]GTP gamma S-binding assays using rat brain membranes or Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing mu- or delta-opioid receptors. The analogs showed delta-antagonist selectivity with differences regarding their isomeric forms, and these analogs containing a C-terminal carboxamide group displayed a mixed mu-agonist/delta-antagonist profile, thus they are expected to be safer analgesics with a low propensity to produce tolerance and physical dependence. These results constitute further examples of the influence of beta-methyl substitution and C-terminal amidation on potency, selectivity, and signal transduction properties of TIPP-related peptides as well as they represent valuable pharmacological tools for opioid research.

The aim of this study was, therefore, to provide comparative binding characteristics of agonists (epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, fenoterol, salbutamol, salmeterol, terbutalin, formoterol, broxaterol) and antagonists (propranolol, alprenolol, atenolol, metoprolol, bisoprolol, carvedilol, pindolol, BRL 37344, CGP 20712, SR 59230A, CGP 12177, ICI 118551) at all three subtypes of human beta-adrenergic receptors in an identical cellular background. We generated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the three beta-adrenergic receptor subtypes at comparable levels. We characterized these receptor subtypes and analyzed the affinity of routinely used drugs as well as experimental compounds in competition binding studies, using the non-selective antagonist I-125-cyanopindolol as a radioligand. Furthermore, we analyzed the beta-receptor-mediated adenylyl cyclase activity in isolated membranes from these cell lines. The results from our experiments show that all compounds exhibit distinct patterns of selectivity and activity at the three beta-receptor subtypes. In particular, a number of beta(2)- or beta(3)-receptor agonists that are inverse agonists at the other subtypes were identified. In addition, beta(1)-receptor antagonists with agonistic activity at beta(2)- and beta(3)-receptors were found. These specific mixtures of agonism, antagonism, and inverse agonism at different subtypes may have important implications for the therapeutic use of the respective compounds.

The proliferation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC) is closely related to the progression of liver fibrosis in chronic liver diseases. We investigated the inhibitory effect of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the major potential inhibitory component of green-tea polyphenols, on the proliferation of HSC. The aim of this study was to clarify the molecular mechanisms of EGCG inhibition of HSC proliferation. Methods: A cultured human hepatic stellate cell line L190 was used for this study. The cells were stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB in the presence or absence of EGCG. Proliferation was determined by bromodeoxy-uridine incorporation. The mRNA expressions of collagen alpha1(I) and (IV) were evaluated by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. PDGF receptor tyrosine phosphorylation was detected using anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. PDGF receptor radioligand binding assay was performed by [I-125]-PDGF-BB. Results: EGCG inhibited the PDGF-BB-induced cell-proliferation and collagen alpha1(I) and (IV) mRNA expressions. EGCG reduced the autophosphorylation of the PDGF receptor. EGCG blocked PDGF-BB binding to its receptor in a non-competitive manner. Conclusions: EGCG has an inhibitory effect on PDGF-induced proliferation of HSC, and the blocking of PDGF-BB binding to its receptor may be the mechanism behind this effect.

Although the exact function of sigma-l (sigma(1)) receptors is not yet known, their role in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ levels and sterol biosynthesis, functions that could be assigned to mitochondria, are the only mechanisms described. 2 Using preparations of purified rat liver and brain mitochondria we demonstrate herein the presence of a-like binding sites. [H-3](+)-pentazocine, a sigma(1) radioligand was used to label these sites. 3 In the liver, [H-3](+)-pentazocine labelled one class of binding sites with high affinity (K-d 3 rim), similar to that observed in liver microsomes and synaptic membranes. These sites were located on the outer mitochondrial membranes and displayed high affinity for other sigma(1) ligands namely, haloperidol, ifenprodil, carbetapentane or 1,3-di(2-tolyl)guanidine (DTG). 4 The presence of a, receptors on liver mitochondria was confirmed using double fluorescence immunostaining. 5 [H-3](+)-pentazocine binding sites were also found on brain mitochondria but they appeared pharmacologically distinct to the liver ones as [H-3](+)-pentazocine and typical sigma(1) ligands displayed lower affinities for these sites. Nevertheless, [H-3](+)-pentazocine binding on both liver and brain mitochondria was modulated by progesterone, a putative endogenous ligand for a receptors. 6 Our data demonstrates the presence of ['H](+)-pentazocine binding sites with pharmacological characteristics identical to sigma(1) receptors on rat liver mitochondrial membranes. The pharmacological significance of these sites and their role on mitochondrial function remain unknown.

An efficient brain penetration is one of the main prerequisites to further evaluate compounds displaying high potency to bind the NK3 receptor. The present report describes a method for determining the in vivo occupancy of central NK3 receptors after peripheral administration of drugs. An ex vivo measurement of NK3 receptor occupancy by quantitative autoradiography employing [H-3]senktide as the radioligand has been developed. The speed of the method, which is usually considered low due to the time dedicated to film exposure (from weeks to months), has been considerably increased by the use of the beta -imager. The high sensitivity of this new radiomager was used to visualize and quantitatively analyze the [H-3]senktide binding sites in brain sections within hours. Using this method, we have demonstrated that the reference NK3 antagonist SR142801 dose dependently occupied the NK3 receptors in the gerbil brain after subcutaneous administration with an ED50 of 0.85 mg/kg. The less active enantiomer SR142806 occupied the NK3 receptors only by 25% at the highest used dose of 10 mg/kg. These values are in accordance with the reported behavioral effects of the compounds. Our results indicate that ex vivo receptor occupancy measurements can be dependently used to predict the central activity of NK3 antagonists. More generally, the combination of ex vivo receptor autoradiography with the beta -imager detection constitutes a new and fast method to evaluate the brain penetration of drug candidates.

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter that modulates rewarding properties of food, is likely to be involved. To test the hypothesis that obese individuals have abnormalities in brain dopamine activity we measured the availability of dopamine D-2 receptors in brain. Methods Brain dopamine D-2 receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride (a radioligand for the dopamine D-2 receptor). Bmax/Kd (ratio of the distribution volumes in striatum to that in cerebellum minus 1) was used as a measure of dopamine D-2 receptor availability. Brain glucose metabolism was also assessed with 2-deoxy-2[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG). Findings Striatal dopamine D-2 receptor availability was significantly lower in the ten obese individuals (2.47 [SD 0.36]) than in controls (2.99 [0.41]; p less than or equal to0.0075). In the obese individuals body mass index (BMI) correlated negatively with the measures of D-2 receptors (r=0.84; p less than or equal to0.002); the individuals with the lowest D-2 values had the largest BMI. By contrast, neither whole brain nor striatal metabolism differed between obese individuals and controls, indicating that striatal reductions in D-2 receptors were not due to a systematic reduction in radiotracer delivery. Interpretation The availability of dopamine D-2 receptor was decreased in obese individuals in proportion to their BMI. Dopamine modulates motivation and reward circuits and hence dopamine deficiency in obese individuals may perpetuate pathological eating as a means to compensate for decreased activation of these circuits. Strategies aimed at improving dopamine function may be beneficial in the treatment of obese individuals.

The (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of 3a-c were obtained by resolution of the respective racemates using the antipodes of O,O'-dibenzoyltartaric acid (resolution of rac-3a), O,O'-di-p-toluoyltartaric acid (resolution of rac-3b), or 1,1'-bi-naphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate (resolution of rac-3c). The enantiomeric purities of (R)-3a-c and (S)-3a-c were greater than or equal to 98% ee (determined by H-1-NMR spectroscopy using a chiral solvating agent). Reaction of rac-3a-c. (R)-3a-e, (S)-3a-c, and 5a-c with methyl iodide gave the corresponding methylammonium iodides rac-4a-c, (R)4a-c, (S)-4a-c, and 6a-c (3a-c 4a-c; 5a-c 6a-c). The absolute configuration of (S)-3a was determined by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis of its (R,R)-O,O'-dibenzoyltartrate. The absolute configurations of the silicon analog (R)-4b and germanium analog (R)-4c were also determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The chiroptical properties of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers of 3a-c, 3a-e-HCl, and 4a-c were studied by ORD measurements. In addition, the C/Si/Ge analogs (R)-3a-c, (S)-3a-c, (R)4a-c, (S)-4a-c, 5a-c, and 6a-c were studied for their affinities at recombinant human muscarinic M-1, M-2, M-3, M-4, and M-5 receptors stably expressed in CHO-KI cells (radioligand binding experiments with [3 HIN-methylscopolamine as the radioligand). For reasons of comparison, the known C/Si/Ge analogs Ph(2)El(CH2OH)CH2CH2NR2 (NR2 = piperidino, El = C, 7a; El = Si, 7b, El = Ge, 7c) and the corresponding methylammonium iodides 8a-c were included in these studies. According to these experiments, all the C/Si/Ge analogs behaved as simple competitive antagonists at MI-M, receptors. The receptor subtype affinities of the individual carbon, silicon. and germanium analogs 3a-8a. 3b-8b. and 3c-8c were similar, indicating a strongly pronounced C/Si/Ge bioisosterism. The (R)-enantiomers (eutomers) of 3a-c and 4a-c exhibited higher affinities (up to 22.4 fold) for MI-M, receptors than their corresponding (S)-antipodes (distomers), the stereoselectivity ratios being higher at M-1, M-3, M-4, and M-5 than at M-2 receptors, and higher for the methylammonium compounds (4a-c) than for the amines (3a-c). With a few exceptions, compounds 5a-C, 6a-c, 7a-c, and 8a-c displayed lower affinities for M-1-M-5 receptors than the related (R)-enantiomers of 3a-c and 4a-c. The stereoselective interaction of the enantiomers of 3a-c and 4a-c with M-1-M-5 receptors is best explained in terms of opposite binding of the phenyl and cyclopentyl ring of the (R)- and (S)-enantiomers. The highest receptor subtype selectivity was observed for the germanium compound (R)-4c at M-1/M-2 receptors (12.9-fold). (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Striatal dopamine synthesis and cognitive flexibility differ between hormonal contraceptive users and nonusers	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						cognitive flexibility; dopamine; hormonal contraception; PET imaging	AMINO-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SYNTHESIS CAPACITY; RECEPTOR-BINDING; HUMAN-BRAIN; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; ORAL-CONTRACEPTIVES; MEMORY CIRCUITRY; PET; PROGESTERONE	In rodents and nonhuman primates, sex hormones are powerful modulators of dopamine (DA) neurotransmission. Yet less is known about hormonal regulation of the DA system in the human brain. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we address this gap by comparing hormonal contraceptive users and nonusers across multiple aspects of DA function: DA synthesis capacity via the PET radioligand 6-[F-18]fluoro-m-tyrosine ([F-18]FMT), baseline D2/3 receptor binding potential using [C-11]raclopride, and DA release using methylphenidate-paired [C-11]raclopride. Participants consisted of 36 healthy women (n = 15 hormonal contraceptive users; n = 21 naturally cycling/non users of hormonal contraception), and men (n = 20) as a comparison group. A behavioral index of cognitive flexibility was assessed prior to PET imaging. Hormonal contraceptive users exhibited greater DA synthesis capacity than NC participants, particularly in dorsal caudate, and greater cognitive flexibility. Furthermore, across individuals, the magnitude of striatal DA synthesis capacity was associated with cognitive flexibility. No group differences were observed in D2/3 receptor binding or DA release. Analyses by sex alone may obscure underlying differences in DA synthesis tied to women's hormone status. Hormonal contraception (in the form of pill, shot, implant, ring, or intrauterine device) is used by similar to 400 million women worldwide, yet few studies have examined whether chronic hormonal manipulations impact basic properties of the DA system. Findings from this study begin to address this critical gap in women's health.

Unfortunately, the available antiarrhythmic drugs show limited efficacy and proarrhythmic potential. Thus, efforts should be made to search for new, more effective, and safer pharmacotherapies. Several studies suggested that blocking the alpha(1)-adrenoceptors could restore normal heart rhythm in arrhythmia. In this study, we aimed to assess the antiarrhythmic potential of S-61 and S-73, two novel pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives with high affinity for alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. First, using radioligand binding studies, we demonstrated that S-61 and S-73 did not bind with beta(1)-adrenoceptors. Next, we assessed whether S-61 and S-73 could protect rats against arrhythmia in adrenaline-, calcium chloride- and aconitine-induced arrhythmia models. Both compounds showed potent prophylactic antiarrhythmic properties in the adrenaline-induced arrhythmia model, but the effect of S-61 was more pronounced. None of the compounds displayed antiarrhythmic effects in calcium chloride- or aconitine-induced arrhythmia models. Interestingly, both derivatives revealed therapeutic antiarrhythmic activity in the adrenaline-induced arrhythmia, diminishing heart rhythm irregularities. Neither S-61 nor S-73 showed proarrhythmic potential in rats. Finally, the compounds decreased blood pressure in rodents. The hypotensive effects were not observed after coadministration with methoxamine, which suggests the alpha(1)-adrenolytic properties of both compounds. Our results confirm that pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives possess potent antiarrhythmic properties. Given the promising results of our experiments, further studies on pyrrolidin-2-one derivatives might result in the development of a new class of antiarrhythmic drugs.

This study aimed at investigating thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives as non-nucleoside A(1) agonists that could be used in pharmaco-resistant epilepsy (PRE). Compound 7c (thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivative), displayed good binding affinity to the rA(1) AR (K-i = 61.9 nM). This could be a breakthrough for further investigation of this heterocyclic scaffold as potential ligand. In silico evaluation of this compound raised bioavailability concerns but performed well on drug-likeness tests. The effect of intramolecular cyclisation that occurs during synthesis of thieno[2,3-b]pyridines from the lead compounds, amino-3,5-dicyanopyridine derivatives (6a-s) in relation to AR binding was also evaluated. A significant loss of activity against rA(1)/rA(2A) ARs with cyclisation was revealed. Amino-3,5-dicyanopyridines exhibited greater affinity towards rA(1 )ARs (K-i < 10 nM) than rA(2A). Compound 6c had the best rA(1) affinity (K, = 0.076 nM). Novel compounds (6d, 6k, 6l, 6m, 6n, 6o, 6p) were highly selective towards rA(1) AR (K-i between 0.179 and 21.0 nM). Based on their high selectivity for A(1) ARs, amino-3,5-dicyanopyridines may be investigated further as AR ligands in PRE with the right structural optimisations and formulations. [GRAPHICS] .

Using a mouse model expressing DAT with mutated PDZ-binding sequence (DAT-AAA), we previously demonstrated the importance of this binding sequence for striatal expression of DAT. Here, we show by application of direct stochastic reconstruction microscopy not only that the striatal level of transporter is reduced in DAT-AAA mice but also that the nanoscale distribution of this transporter is altered with a higher propensity of DAT-AAA to localize to irregular nanodomains in dopaminergic terminals. In parallel, we observe mesostriatal DA adaptations and changes in DA-related behaviors distinct from those seen in other genetic DAT mouse models. DA levels in the striatum are reduced to X45% of that of WT, accompanied by elevated DA turnover. Nonetheless, fast-scan cyclic voltammetry recordings on striatal slices reveal a larger amplitude and prolonged clearance rate of evoked DA release in DAT-AAA mice compared with WT mice. Autoradiography and radioligand binding show reduced DA D2 receptor levels, whereas immunohistochemistry and autoradiography show unchanged DA D1 receptor levels. In behavioral experiments, we observe enhanced self-administration of liquid food under both a fixed ratio of one and progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement but a reduction compared with WT when using cocaine as reinforcer. In summary, our data demonstrate how disruption of PDZ domain interactions causes changes in DAT expression and its nanoscopic distribution that in turn alter DA clearance dynamics and related behaviors.

Our objective was to retrospectively analyze the activity of [177Lu]-PSMA-617 given off-trial to men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and identify clinical factors associated with PSA response. Electronic medical records of all men treated with [177Lu]-PSMA-617 were reviewed and analyzed. Overall survival was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association between potential variables and PSA response was analyzed by univariate analysis, using either logistic regression or chi (2)/Fisher's exact test. Multivariable analysis was carried out using logistic regression on all categorical variables with a P-value of <0.1 on univariate analysis. Variables found to be statistically significant were then used to define a categorical score. A total of 52 patients received at least one cycle of [177Lu]-PSMA-617. Clinical benefit was observed in 28 patients (52%). PSA decline <greater than or equal to>20% and >= 50% was observed in 26 (50%) and 18 patients (35%), respectively. Achievement of any PSA decline at first measurement was significantly associated with survival. There was a negative association between the number of previous chemotherapy lines and PSA decline above 20%. Univariate analysis followed by multivariable analysis showed that older age and higher hemoglobin were significantly associated with a PSA decline >20%. A score combining these two parameters was significantly associated with PSA response. In summary, [177Lu]-PSMA-617 is active in the 'real-life' setting of heavily pretreated men with mCRPC.

TSPO PET Using [<SUP>18</SUP>F]PBR111 Reveals Persistent Neuroinflammation Following Acute Diisopropylfluorophosphate Intoxication in the Rat	TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						diisopropylfluorophosphate; GFAP; IBA1; in vivo imaging; positron emission tomography; organophosphate; neuroinflammation; TSPO	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; SPONTANEOUS RECURRENT SEIZURES; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INDUCED BRAIN-DAMAGE; STATUS-EPILEPTICUS; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; SOMAN; EXPOSURE; MODEL; INFLAMMATION	Acute intoxication with organophosphates (OPs) can trigger status epilepticus followed by persistent cognitive impairment and/or electroencephalographic abnormalities. Neuroinflammation is widely posited to influence these persistent neurological consequences. However, testing this hypothesis has been challenging, in part because traditional biometrics preclude longitudinal measures of neuroinflammation within the same animal. Therefore, we evaluated the performance of noninvasive positron emission tomography (PET), using the translocator protein (TSPO) radioligand [F-18]PBR111 against classic histopathologic measures of neuroinflammation in a preclinical model of acute intoxication with the OP diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP). Adult male Sprague Dawley rats administered pyridostigmine bromide (0.1 mg/kg, im) 30 min prior to administration of DFP (4 mg/kg, sc), atropine sulfate (2 mg/kg, im) and 2-pralidoxime (25 mg/kg, im) exhibited moderate-to-severe seizure behavior. TSPO PET performed prior to DFP exposure and at 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days postexposure revealed distinct lesions, as defined by increased standardized uptake values (SUV). Increased SUV showed high spatial correspondence to immunohistochemical evidence of neuroinflammation, which was corroborated by cytokine gene and protein expression. Regional SUV metrics varied spatiotemporally with days postexposure and correlated with the degree of neuroinflammation detected immunohistochemically. Furthermore, SUV metrics were highly correlated with seizure severity, suggesting that early termination of OP-induced seizures may be critical for attenuating subsequent neuroinflammatory responses. Normalization of SUV values to a cerebellar reference region improved correlations to all outcome measures and seizure severity. Collectively, these results establish TSPO PET using [F-18]PBR111 as a robust, noninvasive tool for longitudinal monitoring of neuroinflammation following acute OP intoxication.

This study sought to increase the oral bioavailability of opioid peptides by cyclization, using Hantzsch-based macrocyclization strategies to produce two new series of cyclized DAMGO and Leu/Met-enkephalin analogs. Opioid receptor affinity and selectivity for compounds in each series were assessed in vitro with radioligand competition binding assays. Compounds demonstrated modest affinity but high selectivity for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors (MOR, DOR and KOR), while selectivity for mu opioid receptors varied by structure. Antinociceptive activity of each compound was initially screened in vivo following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration and testing in the mouse 55 degrees C warm-water tail-withdrawal test. The four most active compounds were then evaluated for dose-and time-dependent antinociception, and opioid receptor selectivity in vivo. Cyclic compounds 1924-10, 1936-1, 1936-7, and 1936-9 produced robust and long-lasting antinociception with ED50 values ranging from 0.32-0.75 nmol following i.c.v. administration mediated primarily by mu- and delta-opioid receptor agonism. Compounds 1924-10, 1936-1 and 1936-9 further displayed significant time-dependent antinociception after oral (10 mg kg(-1), p.o.) administration. A higher oral dose (30 mg kg(-1). p.o.) of all four cyclic peptides also reduced centrally-mediated respiration, suggesting successful penitration into the CNS. Overall, these data suggest cyclized opioid peptides synthesized by a Hantzsch-based macrocyclization strategy can retain opioid agonist activity to produce potent antinociception in vivo while conveying improved bioavailability following oral administration.

Influence of alcoholism and cholesterol on TSPO binding in brain: PET [<SUP>11</SUP>C]PBR28 studies in humans and rodents	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; 18 KDA; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; MESSENGER-RNA; ETHANOL; NEUROINFLAMMATION; RADIOLIGAND; INHIBITOR; INFLAMMATION; POLYMORPHISM	Neuroinflammation appears to contribute to neurotoxicity observed with heavy alcohol consumption. To assess whether chronic alcohol results in neuroinflammation we used PET and [C-11]PBR28, a ligand that binds to the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), to compare participants with an alcohol use disorder (AUD: n = 19) with healthy controls (HC: n = 17), and alcohol-dependent (n = 9) with -nondependent rats (n = 10). Because TSPO is implicated in cholesterol's transport for steroidogenesis, we investigated whether plasma cholesterol levels influenced [C-11]PBR28 binding. [C-11]PBR28 binding did not differ between AUD and HC. However, when separating by TSPO genotype rs6971, we showed that medium-affinity binders AUD participants showed lower [C-11]PBR28 binding than HC in regions of interest (whole brain, gray and white matter, hippocampus, and thalamus), but no group differences were observed in high-affinity binders. Cholesterol levels inversely correlated with brain [C-11]PBR28 binding in combined groups, due to a correlation in AUD participants. In rodents, we observed no differences in brain [C-11]PBR28 uptake between alcohol-dependent and -nondependent rats. These findings, which are consistent with two previous [C-11]PBR28 PET studies, may indicate lower activation of microglia in AUD, whereas failure to observe alcohol effects in the rodent model indicate that species differences do not explain the discrepancy with prior rodent autoradiographic studies reporting increases in TSPO binding with chronic alcohol. However, reduced binding in AUD participants could also reflect competition from endogenous TSPO ligands such as cholesterol; and since the rs6971 polymorphism affects the cholesterol-binding domain of TSPO this could explain why differences were observed only in medium-affinity binders.

However, a lack of selectivity against off-targets has been a limiting factor for their clinical use. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH The binding affinity and selectivity of YH12852 for human 5-HT4(a) receptor in CHO-K1 cells were evaluated using radioligand binding assays, and agonistic activity was assessed using a beta-lactamase reporter system. Contractile activity and propulsive motility were measured in the guinea pig isolated distal colon. Its prokinetic effect on the gastrointestinal tract was evaluated in guinea pigs, dogs and monkeys. Its tissue distribution was evaluated in rats. KEY RESULTS YH12852 exhibited high affinity and potency for human recombinant 5-HT4(a) receptor with high selectivity over other 5-HT and non-5-HT receptors, ion channels, enzymes and transporters. YH12852 induced contractions and increased propulsivemotility in guinea pig isolated colon. These effects were abolished by the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist GR113808. YH12852 increased defecation more effectively than prucalopride in guinea pigs and dogs and improved gastric emptying more effectively than mosapride in guinea pigs, dogs and monkeys. YH12852 was highly distributed to the gastrointestinal tract as the target organ. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS The high in vitro potency and selectivity of YH12852 for 5-HT4 receptor translated into potent in vivo efficacy with good tolerability. YH12852 significantly improved both upper and lower bowel motility in the animal models tested and has the potential to address considerable unmet needs in patients with functional constipation, gastroparesis or both.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of nicotine-induced dopamine release in squirrel monkeys using [<SUP>18</SUP>F]Fallypride	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Nicotine; Primate; Imaging; Pet; Dopamine; Fallypride	VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; CIGARETTE SMOKERS; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BASAL GANGLIA; DRUG-ABUSE; BINDING; ADDICTION	Background: Nicotine, the principal psychoactive tobacco constituent, is thought to produce its reinforcing effects via actions within the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system. The objective of the current study was to examine the effect of nicotine on DA D-2/D-3 receptor availability in the nonhuman primate brain with the use of the radioligand [F-18]fallypride and positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: Ten adult male squirrel monkeys were used in the current study. Each subject underwent two PET scans, one with an injection (IV) of saline and subsequently one with an injection of nicotine (0.032 mg/kg). The DA D2/D3 antagonist, [F-18]fallypride, was delivered IV at the beginning of each scan, and nicotine or saline was delivered at 45 min into the scan. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn on specific brain regions and these were used to quantify standard uptake values (SUVs). The SUV is defined as the average concentration of radioactivity in the ROI x body weight/injected dose. Using the cerebellum as a reference region, SUV ratios (SUVROI/ SUVcerebellum.) were calculated to compare saline and nicotine effects in each ROI. Results: Two-way repeated ANOVA revealed a significant decrease of SUV ratios in both striatal and extrastriatal regions following an injection of nicotine during the PET scans. Conclusions: Like other drugs of abuse, these results indicate that nicotine administration may produce DA release, as suggested by the decrease in [F-18]fallypride signal in striatal regions. These findings from a nonhuman primate model provide further evidence that the mesolimbic DA system is affected by the use of products that contain nicotine.

Upregulation of the kappa opioidergic system in left ventricular rat myocardium in response to volume overload Adaptive changes of the cardiac kappa opioid system in heart failure	PHARMACOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Aortocaval fistula; Heart failure; Kappa opioid receptor; Prodynorphin; Localization	RECEPTOR STIMULATION; OXIDATIVE STRESS; INTRACELLULAR CA2+; BINDING-SITES; CARDIOPROTECTION; HYPERTROPHY; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; LOCALIZATION; ANESTHETICS	Opioids have long been known for their analgesic effects and are therefore widely used in anesthesia and intensive care medicine. However, in the last decade research has focused on the opioidergic influence on cardiovascular function. This project thus aimed to detect the precise cellular localization of kappa opioid receptors (KOR) in left ventricular cardiomyocytes and to investigate putative changes in KOR and its endogenous ligand precursor peptide prodynorphin (PDYN) in response to heart failure. After IRB approval, heart failure was induced using a modified infrarenal aortocaval fistula (ACF) in male Wistar rats. All rats of the control and ACF group were characterized by their morphometrics and hemodynamics. In addition, the existence and localization as well as adaptive changes of KOR and PDYN were investigated using radioligand binding, double immunofluorescence confocal analysis, RT-PCR and Western blot. Similar to the brain and spinal cord, [H-3]U-69593 KOR selective binding sites were detected the left ventricle (LV). KOR colocalized with Ca(v)1.2 of the outer plasma membrane and invaginated T-tubules and intracellular with the ryanodine receptor of the sarcoplasmatic reticulum. Interestingly, KOR could also be detected in mitochondria of rat LV cardiomyocytes. As a consequence of heart failure, KOR and PDYN were up-regulated on the mRNA and protein level in the LV. These findings suggest that the cardiac kappa opioidergic system might modulate rat cardiomyocyte function during heart failure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Michael			Wounding alters blood chemistry parameters and skin mineralocorticoid receptors in house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							GLUCOCORTICOID REGULATION; SEASONAL-CHANGES; GENE-EXPRESSION; IMMUNE ACTIVITY; STRESS; RESPONSES; AUGMENTATION; FIBROBLASTS; ACTIVATION; IMMUNOLOGY	Because skin is an important physical barrier against pathogens, the ability to quickly and effectively heal wounds directly impacts an animal's health. The hormone corticosterone (CORT) has many complex effects on immune function and can slow wound healing. It has been suggested that CORT's role during wound healing may be to act as a brake on inflammation and cell proliferation. This project aimed to clarify the role of CORT in the healing process by quantifying concentrations of its two intracellular receptors, glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR), in the skin of wounded (n=9) or unwounded (n=8) house sparrows (Passer domesticus) using radioligand binding assays. We also quantified GR and MR in liver, spleen and pectoralis muscle, as well as several blood chemistry parameters, hypothesizing that wounding would alter whole-body energy use. One day post-wounding, wounded birds had higher blood glucose and lower aspartate aminotransferase (a marker indicating muscle damage or catabolism) compared to controls, which may be related to animals' changing metabolic needs in response to lymphocyte and macrophage recruitment at the wound site. Birds had significantly decreased MR, but not GR, in the skin of wounded legs compared to the skin of unwounded legs. There was also a trend towards lower MR in wounded skin compared to unwounded birds. Receptors in the three other tissues did not differ between groups. This study suggests that decreasing the skin's sensitivity to CORT immediately after wounding may be a necessary part of the normal healing process in wild birds. J. Exp. Zool. 323A: 322-330, 2015.

Examination of synaptic norepinephrine concentrations in the living brain may be possible with positron emission tomography (PET), but has been hampered by the lack of suitable radioligands. Methods: We explored the use of the novel alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor antagonist PET tracer [C-11]ORM-13070 for measurement of amphetamine-induced changes in synaptic norepinephrine. The effect of amphetamine on [C-11]ORM-13070 binding was evaluated ex vivo in rat brain sections and in vivo with PET imaging in monkeys. Results: Microdialysis experiments confirmed amphetamine-induced elevations in rat striatal norepinephrine and dopamine concentrations. Regional [C-11]ORM-13070 receptor binding was high in the striatum and low in the cerebellum. After injection of [C-11]ORM-13070 in rats, mean striatal specific binding ratios, determined using cerebellum as a reference region, were 1.4 +/- 0.3 after vehicle pretreatment and 1.2 +/- 0.2 after amphetamine administration (0.3 mg/kg, subcutaneous). Injection of [C-11]ORM-13070 in non-human primates resulted in mean striatal binding potential (BPND) estimates of 0.65 +/- 0.12 at baseline. Intravenous administration of amphetamine (0.5 and 1.0 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced BPND values by 31-50%. Amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg, subcutaneous) increased extracellular norepinephrine (by 400%) and dopamine (by 270%) in rat striata. Conclusions: Together, these results indicate that [C-11]ORM-13070 may be a useful tool for evaluation of synaptic norepinephrine concentrations in vivo. Future studies are required to further understand a potential contribution of dopamine to the amphetamine-induced effect.

Synthesis, docking and preliminary <i>in vivo</i> evaluation of serotonin dithiocarbamate as novel SPECT neuroimaging agent	MEDCHEMCOMM			English	Article							5-HT1A RECEPTOR; HIGH-AFFINITY; TC-99M RADIOLIGAND; ACCURATE DOCKING; LIGAND-BINDING; CHOLESTEROL; DERIVATIVES; WAY-100635; COMPLEXES; GLIDE	Functional imaging, for understanding the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders and neurocognition pathways, can be achieved by targeting receptors in the central neural system (CNS). The multitude of physiological functions elicited by the interaction of serotonin with its receptors and the relation between the level and 'state' of the serotonin receptor (5-HT1A) and neuropsychiatric diseases makes this receptor an attractive target for imaging and therapeutics. Thus, for imaging of "active" 5-HT1A a ligand with an agonistic mode of binding has been designed and evaluated as a SPECT radiotracer. In this study, serotonin, the natural ligand, has been modified as the dithiocarbamate and radiolabelled with Tc-99m. The efficacy of the complex as an imaging agent has been evaluated in terms of radiochemical purity, stability, lipophilicity, biodistribution pattern and scintigraphy. For understanding the binding mode, the ligand has been docked on the 5-HT1A receptor homology models built using the crystal structure of the human beta 2-adrenergic receptor in the presence (PDB 3D4S) and absence (PDB 2RH1) of cholesterol. The docking results are in line with the agonist mode of binding for the ligand and strongly supported by the experimental data. Preliminary results indicate excellent radiolabelling above 95%, a biphasic blood clearance pattern with t(1/2) (fast) of 45 minutes and t(1/2) (slow) of 5.9 hours and a predominantly hepatobiliary excretion route. The regional brain uptake studies indicate localization of the complex in the hippocampus region. Thus, a novel dithiocarbamate based on the scaffold of serotonin has been synthesized and evaluated as a potential neuroimaging agent.

Identification of Propofol Binding Sites in a Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor with a Photoreactive Propofol Analog	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							GATED ION-CHANNEL; NONCOMPETITIVE ANTAGONIST; GENERAL-ANESTHETICS; GABA(A) RECEPTOR; ETOMIDATE; POTENTIATION; DESENSITIZATION; SUBUNIT; STATE	Propofol, a widely used intravenous general anesthetic, acts at anesthetic concentrations as a positive allosteric modulator of gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptors and at higher concentration as an inhibitor of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, we characterize propofol binding sites in a muscle-type nAChR by use of a photoreactive analog of propofol, 2-isopropyl-5-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-3H-diazirin-3-yl]phenol (AziPm). Based upon radioligand binding assays, AziPm stabilized the Torpedo nAChR in the resting state, whereas propofol stabilized the desensitized state. nAChR-rich membranes were photolabeled with [H-3] AziPm, and labeled amino acids were identified by Edman degradation. [H-3] AziPm binds at three sites within the nAChR transmembrane domain: (i) an intrasubunit site in the delta subunit helix bundle, photolabeling in the nAChR desensitized state (+agonist) delta M2-18' and two residues in delta M1 (delta Phe-232 and delta Cys-236); (ii) in the ion channel, photolabeling in the nAChR resting, closed channel state (-agonist) amino acids in the M2 helices (alpha M2-6', beta M2-6' and -13', and delta M2-13') that line the channel lumen (with photolabeling reduced by >90% in the desensitized state); and (iii) at the gamma-alpha interface, photolabeling alpha M2-10'. Propofol enhanced [H-3] AziPm photolabeling at alpha M2-10'. Propofol inhibited [H-3]AziPm photolabeling within the delta subunit helix bundle at lower concentrations (IC50 = 40 mu M) than it inhibited ion channel photolabeling (IC50 = 125 mu M). These results identify for the first time a single intrasubunit propofol binding site in the nAChR transmembrane domain and suggest that this is the functionally relevant inhibitory binding site.

On quantitative relationships between drug-like compound lipophilicity and plasma free fraction in monkey and human	JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Protein binding; drug-like properties; physicochemical properties; logP; structure-property relationship; lipophilicity; drug; radiotracer; logD; plasma free fraction	PROTEIN BINDING-AFFINITY; BRAIN 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; SPECIES-DIFFERENCES; SERUM ALBUMINS; RADIOLIGAND; PREDICTION; RADIOMETABOLITE; LIGANDS; DESIGN	Drug interactions with plasma proteins influence their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. We aimed to test whether a strong quantitative relationship exists between plasma free fraction (f(P)) and lipophilicity for low molecular weight nonacidic drug-like compounds. We measured the n-octanol-buffer distribution coefficients at pH 7.4 ((m)logD) of 18 diverse radiotracers (<470 Da) used for brain imaging with positron emission tomography in vivo. Lipophilicities were also computed as (c)logD with two software packages. The f(P) values for monkeys and humans were determined by ultrafiltration and transformed into (m)logDpr/pl values representing the log10 of the within phase partition of the radiotracers between plasma proteins and remaining plasma. mlogDpr/pl correlated strongly with mlogD for human (mlogDpr/pl = 0.733mlogD-0.780, r2 = 0.74) and monkey (mlogDpr/pl = 0.780mlogD-1.15, r2 = 0.83), but less strongly with clogD. These relationships were significantly different between species (P = 0.006). Removal of eight fluorinated compounds from the datasets raised r2 to 0.81 and 0.91 for humans and monkeys, respectively. For the tested compounds, we conclude that n-octanol-buffer (pH 7.4) distribution strongly models that between plasma proteins and remaining plasma and moreover that mlogD accounts for over 74% of compound mlogDpr/pl and is a strong determinant of fP.

Site-Directed Mutations near Transmembrane Domain 1 Alter Conformation and Function of Norepinephrine and Dopamine Transporters	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							BIOGENIC-AMINE TRANSPORTERS; BINDING-SITE; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS; BACTERIAL HOMOLOG; UPTAKE INHIBITION; COCAINE; BENZTROPINE; AMPHETAMINE; SUBSTRATE	The human dopamine and norepinephrine transporters (hDAT and hNET, respectively) control neurotransmitter levels within the synaptic cleft and are the site of action for amphetamine (AMPH) and cocaine. We investigated the role of a threonine residue within the highly conserved and putative phosphorylation sequence RETW, located just before transmembrane domain 1, in regulating hNET and hDAT function. The Thr residue was mutated to either alanine or aspartate. Similar to the inward facing T62D-hDAT, T58D-hNET demonstrated reduced [H-3]DA uptake but enhanced basal DA efflux compared with hNET with no further effect of AMPH. The mutations had profound effects on substrate function and binding. The potency of substrates to inhibit [H-3]DA uptake and compete with radioligand binding was increased in T -> A and/or T -> D mutants. Substrates, but not inhibitors, demonstrated temperature-sensitive effects of binding. Neither the functional nor the binding potency for hNET blockers was altered from wild type in hNET mutants. There was, however, a significant reduction in potency for cocaine and benztropine to inhibit [H-3]DA uptake in T62D-hDAT compared with hDAT. The potency of these drugs to inhibit [H-3](-)-2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane-1,5-napthalenedisulfonate (WIN35,428) binding was not increased, demonstrating a discordance between functional and binding site effects. Taken together, these results concur with the notion that the T -> D mutation in RETW alters the preferred conformation of both hNET and hDAT to favor one that is more inward facing. Although substrate activity and binding are primarily altered in this conformation, the function of inhibitors with distinct structural characteristics may also be affected.

The present study examined the actions of MD-354 on (-)nicotine-induced antinociception. Mouse tail-flick and other assays were employed. In the tail-flick assay, (-)nicotine (ED(50) = 1.66 mg/kg) but not MD-354 produced dose-related antinociceptive effects. Administered in combination with (-)nicotine (2.5 mg/kg), MD-354 (AD(50) = 3.4 mg/kg) did not potentiate, but effectively antagonized the antinociceptive actions of (-)nicotine. In a mouse hot-plate assay, MD-354 failed to modify (-)nicotine responses. In combination with a locomotor activity-suppressing dose of (-)nicotine, MD-354 (up to 17 mg/kg) failed to antagonize (-)nicotine-induced hypolocomotion. In a rat drug discrimination paradigm using (-)nicotine as training drug, MD-354 produced saline-appropriate responding; in combination with the training dose of (-)nicotine, MD-354 failed to antagonize the nicotine cue. MD-354 selectively antagonizes the antinociceptive actions of (-)nicotine in the tail-flick, but not in the hot-plate assay, or either the motor effects, or discriminative stimulus effects of (-)nicotine. The most parsimonious explanation is that MD-354 might act as a negative allosteric modulator of alpha 7 nACh receptors, and radioligand binding and functional data are provided to support this conclusion.

The functional anatomical interactions between NT, the mesotelencephalic dopamine system, and structures targeted by dopaminergic projections have been studied. The present study was conducted to determine the effects of NT receptor subtypes on dopaminergic function with the use of mice lacking either NTS1 (NTS1(-/-)) or NTS2 (NTS2(-/-)). Basal and amphetamine-stimulated locomotor activity was determined. In vivo microdialysis in freely moving mice, coupled with HPLC-ECD, was used to detect basal and D-amphetamine-stimulated striatal extracellular dopamine levels. In vitro radioligand binding and synaptosomal uptake assays for the dopamine transporters were conducted to test for the expression and function of the striatal pre-synaptic dopamine transporter. NTS1(-/-) and NTS2(-/-) mice had higher baseline locomotor activity and higher basal extracellular dopamine levels in striatum. NTS1(-/-) mice showed higher locomotor activity and exaggerated dopamine release in response to D-amphetamine. Both NTS1(-/-) and NTS2(-/-) mice exhibited lower dopamine D-1 receptor mRNA expression in the striatum relative to wild type mice. Dopamine transporter binding and dopamine reuptake in striatum were not altered. Therefore, lack of either NTS1 or NTS2 alters the dopaminergic system. The possibility that the dysregulation of dopamine transmission might stem from a deficiency in glutamate neurotransmission is discussed. The data strengthen the hypothesis that NT receptors are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and provide a potential model for the biochemical changes of the disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the CB1 receptor radioligand [F-18]MK-9470 and small-animal PET, we investigated for the first time in vivo cerebral changes in [F-18]MK-9470 binding in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of Parkinson's disease (PD), parallel to dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) staining, and behavioral measurements. In the 6-OHDA model, relative [F-18]MK-9470 PET binding decreased in the contralateral cerebellum (-9%, p<0.0004) and caudate-putamen bilaterally (ipsilateral -8%, contralateral -7%; p=0.001 and p<0.0003, respectively). The number of TH+ neurons in the substantia nigra was inversely correlated to CB1 receptor binding in the ipsilateral cerebellum (p=1.10(-6)). The behavioral outcome was positively related to regional CB1 receptor binding in the contralateral somatosensory cortex (p =4.10(-6)). in vivo [(18F)]MK-9470 PET imaging points to changes in endocannabinoid transmission, specifically for CB1 receptors in the 6-OHDA model of PD, with mainly involvement of the caudate-putamen, but also distant regions of the motor circuitry, including the cerebellum and somatosensory cortex.

Chen. [Fam. Rhamnaceae] seed have a history of use in traditional Asian medicine for mild anxiety, nervousness and sleep-related problems. Aim of the study: To identify pharmacological targets, extracts of Magnolia officinalis (ME), Ziziphus spinosa (ZE), and a proprietary fixed combination (MZE) were tested for affinity with central nervous system receptors associated with relaxation and sleep. Methods: In vitro radioligand binding and cellular functional assays were conducted on: adenosine A,, dopamine (transporter, D-1, D-2S, D-3, D-4.4 and D-5), serotonin (transporter, 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT4e, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7) and the GABA benzodiazepine receptor. Results: Interactions were demonstrated with the adenosine A(1) receptor, dopamine transporter and dopamine D-5 receptor (antagonist activity), serotonin receptors (5-HT1B and 5-HT6 antagonist activity) and the GABA benzodiazepine receptor at a concentration of 100 mu g/ml or lower. ME had an affinity with adenosine A(1) (K-i of 9.2 +/- 1.1 mu g/ml) and potentiated the GABA activated chloride current at the benzodiazepine subunits of the GABA receptor (maximum effect at 50 mu g/ml). ME had a modest antagonist action with 5-HT6 and ZE with the 5-HT1B receptor. Conclusion: The interactions in the receptor binding models are consistent with the traditional anxiolytic and sleep-inducing activities of Magnolia officinalis bark and Ziziphus spinosa seed.

A point mutation Y151S had been identified in Nilaparvata lugens (brown planthopper) that is associated with target-site resistance to neonicotinoid insecticides. Methionine (M151) is found in the Caenorhabditis eleguns alpha subunit acr18 at the corresponding site to Y151 in Nl alpha 1. Here, the Y151M mutation was introduced into Nl alpha 1 and co-expressed with rat beta 2 in Xenopus oocytes. The influence of the Y151M mutation on the affinity and efficacy of acetylcholine and imidacloprid on hybrid nAChRs Nl alpha 1/beta 2 was examined by radioligand binding and electrophysiology methods. Imidacloprid bound with Nl alpha 1(Y151M)/beta 2 with high affinity, although this was lower than that of Nl alpha 1/beta 2. However, imidacloprid did not show agonist actions on Nl alpha 1(Y151M)/beta 2, although the quite small responses to imidacloprid at high concentrations (0.5-1.0 mM) were detected in some (but not all) cocytes expressing Nl alpha 1(Y151M)/beta 2. Further study demonstrated that imidacloprid acted as an antagoniston Nl alpha 1(Y151M)/beta 2, which blocked responses to acetylcholine on Nl alpha 1(Y151M)/beta 2 with a pIC(50) of 5.14 +/- 0.06. Nl alpha 1(Y151M)/beta 2 nAChRs block by imidacloprid was slowly reversible. This is the first time a point mutation in loop B of insect nAChR alpha subunits has been identified that changes the mode of interaction between neonicotinoid insecticides and insect nAChRs.

The purpose of this study was to determine the biodistribution and the radiation dose of F-18-CPFPX by whole-body scans in humans. Methods Six normal volunteers were examined with 12 whole-body PET scans from 1.5 min to 4.5 h after injection. Volumes of interest were defined over all visually identifiable organs, i.e. liver, gallbladder, kidneys, small intestines, heart, and brain to obtain the organs' volumes and time-activity curves (TACs). TACs were fitted with exponential functions, extrapolated, multiplied with the physical decay and normalized to injected activities so that the residence times could be computed as area under the curve. Radiation doses were calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software for internal dose assessment in nuclear medicine. Results The liver uptake shows peak values (decay-corrected) of up to 35% of the injected radioactivity. About 30% is eliminated by bladder voiding. The highest radiation dose is received by the gallbladder (136.2 +/- 66.1 mu Sv/MBq), followed by the liver (84.4 +/- 10.6 mu Sv/MBq) and the urinary bladder (78.3 +/- 7.1 mu Sv/MBq). The effective dose was 17.6 +/- 0.5 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusions With 300 MBq of injected F-18-CPFPX a subject receives an effective dose (ICRP 60) of 5.3 mSv. Thus the effective dose of an F-18-CPFPX study is comparable to that of other F-18-labelled neuroreceptor ligands.

Among the numerous serotonergic receptors, the 5-HT1A receptor subtype is of interest because of its involvement in cognition, hippocampal neurogenesis, and mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. Previous imaging studies have Suggested altered availability of 5-HT A receptors in MDD but prior antidepressant medication and chronicity of the illness may confound the interpretation. We examined 21 drug-naive primary-care patients with MDD using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635, a radioligand for 5-HT1A receptors, along with 15 healthy control subjects. Binding to receptors was, assessed both regionally and at voxel level with the binding potential (BP) that was estimated using arterial blood input. Compared with healthy controls, the BP of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 was reduced in patients with MDD in most brain regions, ranging from -9% to -25%. Voxel-level analysis confirmed this finding by showing a widespread reduction of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 BP. No statistically significant associations were observed between BP and total HAMD scores in the patients, but lower BP was associated with higher likelihood of insomnia. This study demonstrated a widespread reduction in the availability of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors in a relatively large sample of drug-naive primary-care patients with MDD, suggesting the involvement of this receptor subtype in the pathophysiology of the illness. Lack of correlation with overall severity of the illness may relate to a largely trait-like nature of this abnormality in depressive disorders.

A comparison of the pharmacological properties of guinea-pig and human recombinant 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						gastrointestinal; 5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT4; tegaserod; adenylate cyclase; gastroprokinetic	SPLICE VARIANTS; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; CHOLINERGIC NERVES; MOSAPRIDE CITRATE; IN-VITRO; 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE; AGONISTS; CLONING; COLON; TEGASEROD	Background and purpose: 5-HT4 receptor agonists are used therapeutically to treat disorders of reduced gastrointestinal motility. Since such compounds are evaluated in guinea- pigs, we cloned, expressed and pharmacologically characterized the guinea- pig 5-HT4 and human 5- HT4(b) splice variant, which share 95% homology. The functional properties of guinea- pig 5- HT4(b) receptors were compared with native receptors in guinea- pig colon. Experimental approach: Membrane radioligand binding and whole cell cAMP accumulation assays were used to determine the affinities, potencies and intrinsic activities ( IA). Contraction of the guinea- pig distal colon longitudinal muscle myenteric plexus preparation ( LMMP) was monitored to evaluate functional activity. Key results: pK(i) values for guinea- pig and human recombinant receptors, and guinea- pig striatum 5- HT4 receptors, were in agreement, as were the potency and IA values for guinea- pig and human 5- HT4 receptors expressed at a similar density (similar to 0.2 pmol mg(-1) protein). Tegaserod was a potent ( pEC(50) = 8.4 and 8.7, respectively), full agonist at both guinea- pig and human 5- HT4 receptors. In contrast, in the LMMP preparation, tegaserod was a potent, partial agonist ( pEC(50) = 8.2; IA 66%). Conclusions and implications: Close agreement between the pharmacological properties of guinea- pig and human 5- HT4 receptors support the use of guinea- pig model systems for the identification of 5- HT4 receptor therapeutics. However, the mechanisms underlying the different agonist properties of tegaserod in recombinant and isolated tissue preparations, and the extent to which these impact the clinical efficacy of tegaserod as a prokinetic agent, remain to be determined.

Comparative antagonist pharmacology at the native mouse bradykinin B<sub>2</sub> receptor:: radioligand binding and smooth muscle contractility studies	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						airways; FR173657; ileum; icatibant; lung; MEN11270; MEN16132; LF16-0687; peptide; non-peptide	KININ RECEPTOR; KNOCKOUT MICE; POTENT; CLASSIFICATION; MEN16132; AGONISTS; PEPTIDE; PROFILE; HOE-140; MODEL	Background and purpose: The aim was to characterize the recently discovered non-peptide antagonist MEN16132 at the mouse B-2 receptor, relative to other antagonists. Experimental approach: [H-3]-BK binding experiments used mouse lung and ileum tissue membranes and antagonist potency was measured in the isolated ileum contractility assay. Key results: Two BK binding sites resulted from saturation and homologous competition experiments. A role for the B-1 receptor was excluded because of the poor affinity of B1 receptor ligands (pIC(50) < 5). MEN16132, and the other reference antagonists, inhibited only one portion of BK specific binding, and the rank order of potency was (pIC(50)): Icatibant (lung 10.7; ileum 10.2) = MEN11270 (lung 10.4; ileum 9.9) MEN16132 (lung 10.5; ileum 9.9). > LF16-0687 (lung 8.9; ileum 8.8) > FR173657 ( lung 8.6; ileum 8.2). BK homologous curves performed with lung membranes after treatment with the antagonist MEN16132 or Icatibant (10 nM) displayed only the low affinity site. The functional antagonism by MEN16132 (pA(2) 9.4) and Icatibant (pA(2) 9.1), towards BK (control EC50 6.1 nM) induced ileum contractions, was concentration-dependent and surmountable, but the Schild plot slope was less than unity. Conclusions and Implications: In mouse tissue, radiolabelled BK recognizes two binding sites and B-2 receptor antagonists can compete only for the higher affinity one. The pharmacological profile of the novel non-peptide antagonist MEN16132 indicates that it exhibits subnanomolar affinity and potency for the mouse B2 receptor and is suitable for further characterization in in vivo pathophysiological models.

A mGluR(5) radioligand for in vivo quantification by positron emission tomography (PET) would facilitate studies of the role of this receptor in disease and treatment. 3-Methoxy-5-pyridin-2-ylethynylpyridine (MPEPy), a selective and high-affinity antagonist at the mGluR(5) receptor was selected as a candidate ligand; a recent publication by Yu et al. [Nucl Med Biol 32 (2005) 631-640] presented initial micro-PET results for [C-11]MPEPy with enthusiasm. Building on their efforts, we report as unique contributions (1) an improved chemical synthesis method, (2) the first data using human tissue, (3) phosphor images for rat brain preparations. (4) a novel comparison of anesthetic agents and (5) in vivo data in baboon. In vitro phosphor imaging studies of this ligand using human and rat brain tissue demonstrated high specific binding in the hippocampus, striatum and cortex with minimal specific binding in the cerebellum. In contrast, in vivo micro-PET studies in rats using urethane anesthesia, PET studies in baboons using isoflurane anesthesia and ex vivo micro-PET studies in unanesthetized rats each showed little specific binding in the brain. Despite the promising in vitro results, the low signal-to-noise ratio found in vivo does not justify the use of [C-11]MPEPy as a PET radiotracer in humans. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The objective of this study was to assess if m ethylphenidate, by increasing dopamine (neurotransmitter involved in motivation) in brain, would enhance the saliency of an academic task, making it more interesting. Method: Healthy subjects (N=16) underwent positron emission tomography with [C-11]raclopride (dopamine D-2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous dopamine for binding) to assess the effects of oral methylphenidate (20 mg) on extracellular dopamine in the striatum. The authors compared the effects of methylphenidate during an academic task (solving mathematical problems with monetary reinforcement) and a neutral task (passively viewing cards with no remuneration). in parallel, the effects of methylphenidate on the interest that the academic task elicited were also evaluated. Results: Methylphenidate, when coupled with the mathematical task, significantly increased extracellular dopamine, but this did not occur when coupled with the neutral task. The mathematical task did not increase dopamine when coupled with placebo. Subjective reports about interest and motivation in the mathematical task were greater with methylphenidate than with placebo and were associated with dopamine increases. Conclusions: The significant association between methylphenidate-induced dopamine increases and the interest and motivation for the task confirms the prediction that methylphenidate enhances the saliency of an event by increasing dopamine. The enhanced interest for the task could increase attention and improve performance and could be one of the mechanisms underlying methylphenidate's therapeutic effects. These findings support educational strategies that make schoolwork more interesting as nonpharmacological interventions to treat ADHD.

Recent studies have reported structural as well as functional abnormalities of the thalamus in schizophrenia. The aim of the present exploratory study was to examine D-2/D-3 dopamine receptors in the thalamus as well as the anterior cingulate and the frontal and temporal cortices by using the high-affinity radioligand [C-11]FLB 457 and positron emission tomography (3D PET) and to explore the data in relation to disease, age and psychopathology. Nine drug naive patients with schizophrenia and eight control subjects were examined. Regional binding potential (BP) values were calculated using the simplified reference tissue model. The D-2/D-3 receptor binding was significantly lower in the right medial thalamus in the schizophrenia patients compared to control subjects. In addition, we found a significant negative age effect on the D-2/D-3 BP in the frontal and temporal cortex for both groups. There was no significant age effect on the D-2/D-3 BP in the thalamus or in the anterior cingulate. The result provides additional support to the view that the age effect on D-2/D-3 receptors differ between brain regions. The preliminary finding of low thalamic D-2/D-3 BP in patients strengthens the hypothesis that the thalamus is a key region in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

In a Stille reaction applying [C-11]methyl iodide the labelled compound [5-methyl-C-11]{3-[1-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-methyl-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-yl]-propyl}-dimethylamine ([C-11]-2) was synthesized in 60-90% radiochemical yield. [5-carbonyl-C-11]{1-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-yi]-1-piperidin-1-yl-methanone} ([C-11]-3) was synthesized in 62% radiochemical yield in a palladium mediated cross-coupling reaction utilizing [C-11]carbon monoxide. The specific activity of [C-11]-2 was highly dependent on whether the corresponding trimethyltin or tributyltin precursor was applied. In ex vivo rodent studies compound [C-11]-2 exhibited a good blood-brain barrier (131313) penetration whereas [C-11]-3 did not. The brain distribution of [C-11]-2 was investigated in a non-human primate using PET. There was a rapid uptake of radioactivity into the brain. Accumulation of the radiotracer was in agreement with the known distribution of serotonin transporters. The maximal thalamus to cerebellum ratio of 1.3 was reached after 85 min and the specific binding was partly blocked after pre-treatment with citalopram. Thus, [C-11]-2 does not exhibit appropriate properties as radioligand for visualization of the serotonin transporter in vivo. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Bimatoprost (AGN 192024) is also a pharmacologically novel PGF(2alpha) analog, where the carboxylic acid is replaced by a neutral ethylamide substituent. Bimatoprost potently contracted the feline lung parenchymal preparation (EC50 value of 35-55 nM) but exhibited no meaningful activity in a variety of PG-sensitive tissue and cell preparations. Its activity seemed unrelated to FP receptor stimulation according to the following evidence. 1) Bimatoprost exhibited no meaningful activity in tissues and cells containing functional FP receptors. 2) Bimatoprost activity in the cat lung parenchyma is not species-specific because its potent activity in this preparation could not be reproduced in cells stably expressing the feline FP receptor. 3) Radioligand binding studies using feline and human recombinant FP receptors exhibited minimal competition versus [H-3] 17-phenyl PGF(2a) for Bimatoprost. 4) Bimatoprost pretreatment did not attenuate PGF(2alpha)-induced Ca2+ signals in Swiss 3T3 cells. 5) Regional differences were apparent for Bimatoprost but not FP agonist effects in the cat lung. Bimatoprost reduced intraocular pressure in ocular normotensive and hypertensive monkeys over a 0.001 to 0.1% dose range. A single-dose and multiple-dose ocular distribution/metabolism studies using [H-3] Bimatoprost ( 0.1%) were performed. Within the globe, bimatoprost concentrations were 10- to 100-fold higher in anterior segment tissues compared with the aqueous humor. Bimatoprost was overwhelmingly the predominant molecular species identified at all time points in ocular tissues, indicating that the intact molecule reduces intraocular pressure.

J	Houlihan, WJ; Kelly, L				Houlihan, WJ; Kelly, L			Assessment of mazindane, a pro-drug form of mazindol, in assays used to define cocaine treatment agents	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						cocaine discrimination; (mouse); (rat); (rhesus monkey); mazindane; mazindol; motor activity; mouse; neurotransmitter binding	POTENTIAL INHIBITORS; BINDING-SITE; DOPAMINE; ANALOGS; ANORECTICS	The current studies compared mazindane (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,3-dihydro:5H-imidazo [2,1a] isoindole) hydrogen sulfate, a water soluble pro-drug of mazindol (5-(4-chlorophenyl-2,3-dihydro-5H-imidazo [2,1-a] isoindol-5-ol), with mazindol in assays used to define cocaine treatment agents. Both compounds enhanced motor activity (LMA) in Swiss Webster mice with ED50 values of 2.5 mg/kg i.p. for mazindane and 3.9 mg/kg i.p. for mazindol. At 25 mg/kg mazindane displayed toxic effects and death while mazindol was effect/death free at 50 mg/kg. In Sprague-Dawley rats trained to discriminate cocaine from saline both compounds fully substituted for cocaine with mazindane being fourfold more potent in the total session (0.33 vs. 1.3 mg/kg i.p.) and first reinforcer (0.29 vs. 1.2 mg/kg i.p). Complete substitution was observed in rhesus monkeys trained to discriminate cocaine from saline with ED50 values for mazindane (0.134 mg/kg i.m.) and mazindol (0.119 mg/kg i.m.). Mazindol exhibited little or no activity at 10(-5) M in inhibiting radioligand binding at 14 neurotransmitter sites while mazindane gave weak activity at the histamine H, and 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT3 sites. These results demonstrate that mazindane could be a useful alternative to mazindol as a pharmacological tool because of its similar profile of activity and enhanced water solubility.

J	Hermann, R; Soltész, G				Hermann, R; Soltész, G			Prevalence and HLA association of GAD65 antibodies in Hungarian schoolchildren	HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						type 1 diabetes; GADA; islet-cell antibodies; prediction; HLA genotype	DEPENDENT DIABETES-MELLITUS; ISLET-CELL-ANTIBODIES; GENERAL-POPULATION; CHILDREN; INSULIN; AUTOANTIBODIES; IDDM; DECARBOXYLASE; AUTOIMMUNITY; SIBLINGS	Pancreas beta-cell autoantibodies are important tools in prediction of type I diabetes, however, background frequencies of these markers reveal considerable population-specific variations. The aim of current study was to determine the frequency of glutamic acid decarboxylase (65kD) antibodies (GADA) in healthy Hungarian schoolchildren (n = 2,664) and to correlate development of GADA with HLA DQ genotypes. GADA was determined using a radioligand assay (cut-off limit: 97.5th percentile); HLA DQ genotypes were identified with allele-specific polymerase chain reaction. Thirty-five children (1.3%) tested positive for GADA among which the proportion of girls was significantly higher when compared with boys (1.8% and 0.8%, p = 0.03). The study population was followed for 5.2 years and one girl in the whole cohort, who tested positive for GADA, has developed diabetes. HLA DQ2/DQ8 and DQ2/y genotypes (where y not equal DQB1*0302, *0301, *0602, *0603) were significantly more prevalent in the GADA positive group than in antibody negative children (17.1% vs 1.7%, p = 0.0003 and 25.7% vs 10.3%, P = 0.027, respectively). In conclusion, the prevalence of GADA in the Hungarian general population is in the middle of the range found in other Caucasian ethnic groups. Individuals carrying HLA DR3-DQ2 haplotype and females were more prone to develop GADA. We suggest that for future screening programs it is important to determine predictive value of islet-cell antibodies in populations with varying disease incidence.

H-3-P binding studies show the presence of one type of binding site with an average Kd value of 6.2 +/- 2.0 nM in the cytoplasm and 6.3 +/- 1.1 nM in the nucleus. Competition experiments showed that progesterone (P) was the best competitor, while testosterone, deoxycorticosterone (DOC), corticosterone, 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone; R5020; RU486 and RU26988-5 were poor competitors. We have also investigated the immunological characteristics of progesterone receptor (PR) in both the liver and the oviduct of Podarcis sicula, by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody PR22 raised against the PR isoforms A and B of chicken. One imunoreactive band of about 70 kDa was detected in cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of both the liver and the oviduct. PR immunoreactivity was present in the liver during the quiescent phase. In the oviduct PR immunoreactivity increased from the recovery to the full grown phase. P treatment of estrogen-primed females did not affect the presence of PR in the liver, while brought about a PR increase in the oviduct. This study suggests that PR is expressed differently in the liver and the oviduct of Podarcis sicula throughout the reproductive cycle. PR might fulfill different requirements in relation to the different physiological functions of the tissue during the reproductive cycle. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The alpha(1D)-AR-deficient (alpha(1D)) and control (alpha(1D)(+/+)) mice (n=8 to 14 in each group) were submitted to subtotal nephrectomy and given 1% saline as drinking water for 35 days. Blood pressure (BP) was monitored by tail-cuff readings and confirmed at the end point by direct intraarterial BP recording. The alpha(1D)(-/-) mice had a significantly (P=0.0004) attenuated increase in BP response in this protocol (baseline 94.6 +/- 2.8 versus end point 107.4 +/- 4.5 mm Hg) compared with that of their wild-type counterparts (alpha(1D)(+/+)), from a baseline 97.4 +/- 2.9 to an end point 139.4 +/- 4.5 mm Hg. Seven of 15 alpha(1D)(+/+) mice died with edema, probably owing to renal failure, whereas 14 of 15 alpha(1D)(-/-) mice were maintained for 35 days. Body weight, renal remnant weight, and residual renal function were similar in the 2 groups, whereas the values of plasma catecholamines (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine) were higher in alpha(1D)(+/+) than in the alpha(1D)(-/-) mice. These data suggest that aID-AR plays an important role in developing a high BP in response to dietary salt-loading, and that agents having selective alpha(1D)-AR antagonism could have significant therapeutic potential in the treatment of hypertension.

Beer has been reported to accelerate gastric emptying compared with other beverages that contain the same ethanol concentrations. In this study, we investigated the mechanism that underlies the effects of beer congener on gastrointestinal motility. Methods: Gastric emptying activity was measured by means of movement of a semisolid test meal (0.05% phenol red/1.5% methylcellulose) in mice. To elucidate the mechanism for the effect of beer congener on gastrointestinal motility, we conducted receptor binding assays and contraction study by using longitudinal muscle from guinea pig ileum. Results: Beer congener (1 g/kg orally) enhanced gastric emptying of a semisolid meal in mice. The receptor binding assay revealed that beer congener bound to dopamine D-2 receptor and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(3) receptor. These IC50 values were more than 5 mg/ml. However, beer congener bound to 5-HT2 receptor, 5-HT4 receptor, and muscarinic M-3 receptor with IC50 values of 2, 0.9, and 2 mg/ml, respectively. Beer congener (0.05-2 mg/ml) induced the contraction of longitudinal muscle from guinea pig ileum in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was not affected by either tetrodotoxin (10(-6)M) or ketanserin (10(-7)-10(-5)M), an antagonist for the 5-HT2 receptor. On the other hand, 4-DAMP (10(-8)-10(-5)M), an antagonist for the muscarinic M-3 receptor, inhibited the contraction of the longitudinal muscle induced by beer congener (2 mg/ml) dose dependently. Conclusions: Beer congener stimulates gastrointestinal motility via the muscarinic M-3 receptor.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 22 patients, estrogen receptor status was assessed with planar scintigraphy and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) 4 hours after the injection of 185 MBq I-123-labeled Z-MIVE. For histologic and estrogen receptor immunohistochemical analysis, breast carcinoma tissue was obtained in all patients by means of biopsy or resection of the primary tumor. Two experienced physicians semiquantitatively scored the scintigraphic and immunohistochemical findings. The uptake ratio at scintigraphy and the immunohistologic staining intensity were scored as negative, weak, intermediate, or strong. RESULTS: All patients had histologically proven breast cancer. Immunohistologic staining for estrogen receptors yielded negative findings in four patients and positive findings in 18 (weak staining, n = 2; intermediate staining, n = 6; strong staining, n = 10). Planar 'Wabeled Z-MIVE scintigraphic findings were negative in five patients and positive in 17 (weak uptake, n = 2; intermediate uptake, n = 10; strong uptake, n = 5), resulting in one false-negative finding. Findings at I-123-labeled Z-MIVE SPECT were negative in four patients and positive in 18. The sensitivities of I-123-labeled Z-MIVE scintigraphy for estrogen receptors were 100% with SPECT and 94% with planar scintigraphy. The correlation between immunohistologic and planar scintigraphic scores of estrogen receptor status was 0.72 (P < .01). CONCLUSION: I-123-labeled Z-MIVE scintigraphy is a sensitive noninvasive tool for the detection of estrogen receptors in patients with breast cancer.

However, these drugs often result in orthostatic hypotension, because of their poor uroselectivity; the blockade of alpha(1)-AR not only in prostate but also in vasculature. Here we have investigated uroselectivity of JTH-601, a newly developed antagonist, in radioligand binding experiment using recombinant human alpha(1)-AR subtypes and human prostate. In saturation experiments, [H-3]-JTH-601 showed subtype selectivity: high affinity to alpha(1a)-AR (pKd; 9.88+/-0.09), lower affinity to alpha(1b)-AR (pKd; 8.96+/-0.17) and no specific binding at concentrations up to 3000 pM to alpha(1d)-AR. In competition experiments, JTH-601 and its metabolic compound (JTH-601-G1) also showed alpha(1a)-AR selectivity, exhibiting approximately 5 times higher affinity for alpha(1a)-AR than for alpha(1b)-AR, 10 to 20 times higher affinity than for alpha(1d)-AR, respectively. [H-3]-JTH-601 also bound to human prostate membranes in monophasic manner with high affinity constant (pKd; 9.89+/-0.12, Bmax = 123.6+/-16 fmol/mg protein). JTH-601 is a unique alpha(1)-AR antagonist that shows high affinity and selectivity for human recombinant alpha(1a)- and human prostate. This new compound is useful for understanding alpha(1)-AR pharmacology and may have a therapeutic value. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

[I-125] Cyanoiodopindolol assays demonstrated that binding to SPOCI cell membranes was saturable (B-max = 62.6 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein) and of high affinity (K-d = 6.3 +/- 0.8 pM). From competition experiments, the rank order of potency of agonists (isoproterenol > epinephrine much greater than norepinephrine) and the high affinity (K-i = 0.37 +/- 0.05 nM) of the Bz-selective antagonist ICI 118,551 suppested the predominance of the beta(2)AR subtype. Two isoforms of the a subunit of G(s) (45 and 52 kDa) were identified by Western blot analysis. Isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP levels increased in a dose-dependent manner, confirming that SPOCI cell beta(2)ARs are functionally coupled to adenylyl cyclase. The effect of glucocorticoids on beta(2)AR expression was assessed in radioligand and transient transfection assays. Dexamethasone treatment of SPOCI cells increased both beta(2)AR protein and beta(2)AR-luciferase fusion gene expression 1.6- to 3.1-fold, with the greatest increase demonstrated in cells cultured at low density compared to cells grown at high density.

The properties of four aryl piperazine compounds (RWJ-38063, RWJ-68141, RWJ-68157, and RWJ-69736) are described in this report and compared with the properties of tamsulosin, an alpha(1)-AR antagonist that is used in the treatment of BPH. Radioligand binding studies show that all four RWJ compounds have significantly higher affinity for the alpha(1a)-AR subtype than for the alpha(1b) or alpha(1d) subtype and display a higher level of receptor subtype selectivity than tamsulosin. The RWJ compounds were more potent in inhibiting (+/-)-norepinephrine-induced contractions of isolated rat prostate tissue than those of isolated rat aorta tissue, whereas tamsulosin had the reversed tissue selectivity. RWJ-38063 and RWJ-69736 had the highest potency in the isolated prostate tissue assays of the four RWJ compounds, with pK(B) values of 8.24 and 9.26, respectively, and were 319- and 100-fold more potent in their effects on isolated prostate tissue than aorta tissue. The in vivo uroselectivities of RWJ-38063, RWJ-69736, and tamsulosin were examined in anesthetized dogs. Both RWJ compounds suppressed the intraurethral pressure response to phenylephrine to a greater extent than the mean arterial pressure response; however, RWJ-69736 also caused a marked transient rise in heart rate. Although less potent, RWJ-38063 and RWJ-69736 were notably more uroselective than tamsulosin in this canine model.

Four sets of reconstruction parameters were tested: (1) Scatter, (2) Scatter and Point Spread Function Recovery (PSFR), (3) PSFR only and (4) Penalised likelihood option and Scatter, varying the number of updates (iterations x subsets) with CT-based attenuation correction only. For each, activity concentration (ARC) and contrast recovery coefficients (CRC) were estimated as well as root mean square. Visualisation and quantification parameters were applied to reconstructed patient image data.Results: Optimised quantification parameters were determined to be: CT-based attenuation correction, scatter correction, 12 iterations, 8 subsets and no filter. ARC, CRC and RMS results were dependant on the methodology used for calculations. Two different reconstruction parameters were recommended for visualisation and for quantification. 3D whole-body SPECT images were acquired and reconstructed for Lu-177-PSMA patients in 2-3 times faster than the time taken for a conventional gamma camera.Conclusion: Quantification of whole-body 3D images of patients treated with Lu-177-PSMA is feasible and an optimised set of parameters has been determined. This camera greatly reduces procedure time for whole-body SPECT.

Our previous studies employed the "diaza " derivatives [C-11]TAZA and [F-18]flotaza in order to develop successful positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents for A beta plaques. There is a need for radioiodinated imaging agents for A beta plaques for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET imaging. We report our findings on the preparation of [I-124/125]IAZA, a "diaza " analog of [C-11]TAZA and [F-18]flotaza, and the evaluation of binding to A beta plaques in the postmortem human AD brain. The binding affinity of IAZA for A beta plaques was Ki = 10.9 nM with weak binding affinity for neurofibrillary tangles (Ki = 3.71 mu M). Both [I-125]IAZA and [I-124]IAZA were produced in > 25% radiochemical yield and > 90% radiochemical purity. In vitro binding of [I-125]IAZA and [I-124]IAZA in postmortem human AD brains was higher in gray matter containing A beta plaques compared to white matter (ratio of gray to white matter was > 7). Anti-A beta immunostaining strongly correlated with [(124)/I-125]IAZA in postmortem AD human brains. The binding of [(124)/I-125]IAZA in postmortem human AD brains was displaced by the known A beta plaque imaging agents. Thus, radiolabeled [I-124/123]IAZA may potentially be a useful PET or SPECT radioligand for A beta plaques in brain imaging studies.	[Reddy, Thrisha T. T.; Iguban, Michael H. H.; Melkonyan, Lusine L.

Therapeutic PDE10A inhibition effects on schizophrenia have been reported previously, but the status of this molecule in the living patients with schizophrenia remains elusive. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the central PDE10A status in patients with schizophrenia and examine its relationship with psychopathology, cognition, and corticostriatal glutamate levels. Study design This study included 27 patients with schizophrenia, with 5 antipsychotic-free cases, and 27 healthy controls. Positron emission tomography with [F-18]MNI-659, a specific PDE10A radioligand, was employed to quantify PDE10A availability by measuring non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) of the ligand in the limbic, executive, and sensorimotor striatal functional subregions, and in the pallidum. BPND estimates were compared between patients and controls while controlling for age and gender. BPND correlations were examined with behavioral and clinical measures, along with regional glutamate levels quantified by the magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Study results Multivariate analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant main effect of diagnosis on BPND (p = .03). A posthoc test showed a trend-level higher sensorimotor striatal BPND in patients, although it did not survive multiple comparison corrections. BPND in controls in this subregion was significantly and negatively correlated with the Tower of London scores, a cognitive subtest. Striatal or dorsolateral prefrontal glutamate levels did not correlate significantly with BPND in either group. Conclusions The results suggest altered striatal PDE10A availability and associated local neural dysfunctions in patients with schizophrenia.

Hence, in the search for new A(3)AR ligands, a series of novel 2,N-6-disubstituted adenosines (Ados) was synthesized and tested in radioligand binding and functional assays at ARs. Derivatives bearing a 2-phenethylamino group in the N-6-position were found to exert higher A(3)AR affinity and selectivity than the corresponding N-6-(2,2diphenylethyl) analogues. 2-Chloro-N-6-phenylethylAdo (15) was found to be a potent full A(3)AR agonist with a Ki of 0.024 nM and an EC50 of 14 nM, in a cAMP accumulation assay. Unlike 15, the other ligands behaved as A(3)AR antagonists, which concentration-dependently reduced cell growth and exerted cytostatic activity on the prostate cancer cell line PC3, showing comparable and even more pronounced effects with respect to the ones elicited by the reference full agonist Cl-IB-MECA. In particular, the N-6-(2,2-diphenylethyl)-2-phenylethynylAdo (12: GI(50) = 14 mu M, TGI = 29 mu M, and LC50 = 59 mu M) showed the highest activity proving to be a potential antitumor agent. The cytostatic effect of both A(3)AR agonist (Cl-IB-MECA) and antagonists (12 and other newly synthesized com- pounds) confirm previous observations according to which, in addition to the involvement of A(3)ARs, other cellular mechanisms are responsible for the anticancer effects of these ligands.

In this study, we validate one MTH1 inhibitor TH287 as a PET MTH1 radiotracer. TH287 was radiolabeled with tritium and the binding of [H-3]TH287 to MTH1 was evaluated in live glioblastoma cells (U251MG) through saturation and competitive binding assays, together with in vitro enzymatic assays. Furthermore, TH287 was radiolabeled with carbon-11 for in vivo microPET studies. Saturation binding assays show that [H-3]TH287 has a dissociation constant (K-d) of 1.97 +/- 0.18 nM, B-max of 2676 +/- 122 fmol/mg protein for U251MG cells, and n(H) of 0.98 +/- 0.02. Competitive binding assays show that TH287 (K-i: 3.04 +/- 0.14 nM) has a higher affinity for MTH1 in U251MG cells compared to another well studied MTH1 inhibitor: (S)-crizotinib (K-i: 153.90 +/- 20.48 nM). In vitro enzymatic assays show that TH287 has an IC50 of 2.2 nM in inhibiting MTH1 hydrolase activity and a K-i of 1.3 nM from kinetics assays, these results are consistent with our radioligand binding assays. Furthermore, MicroPET imaging shows that [C-11]TH287 gets into the brain with rapid clearance from the brain, kidney, and heart. The results presented here indicate that radiolabeled TH287 has favorable properties to be a useful tool for measuring MTH1 in vitro and for further evaluation for in vivo PET imaging MTH1 of brain tumors and other central nervous system disorders.

Patients harboring glycine receptor autoantibodies suffer from stiff-person syndrome or its severe variant progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus. Enhanced receptor internalization was proposed as the common molecular mechanism upon autoantibody binding. Although functional impairment of glycine receptors following autoantibody binding has recently been investigated, it is still incompletely understood. Methods A cell-based assay was used for positive sample evaluation. Glycine receptor function was assessed by electrophysiological recordings and radioligand binding assays. The in vivo passive transfer of patient autoantibodies was done using the zebrafish animal model. Results Glycine receptor function as assessed by glycine dose-response curves showed significantly decreased glycine potency in the presence of patient sera. Upon binding of autoantibodies from 2 patients, a decreased fraction of desensitized receptors was observed, whereas closing of the ion channel remained fast. The glycine receptor N-terminal residues(29)A to(62)G were mapped as a common epitope of glycine receptor autoantibodies. An in vivo transfer into the zebrafish animal model generated a phenotype with disturbed escape behavior accompanied by a reduced number of glycine receptor clusters in the spinal cord of affected animals. Interpretation Autoantibodies against the extracellular domain mediate alterations of glycine receptor physiology. Moreover, our in vivo data demonstrate that the autoantibodies are a direct cause of the disease, because the transfer of human glycine receptor autoantibodies to zebrafish larvae generated impaired escape behavior in the animal model compatible with abnormal startle response in stiff-person syndrome or progressive encephalitis with rigidity and myoclonus patients.

Methods [C-11]PBR28 data from 140 healthy volunteers (72 males and 68 females; N = 78 with HAB and N = 62 MAB genotype; age range 19-80 years; BMI range 17.6-36.9) were acquired with High Resolution Research Tomograph at three centres: Karolinska Institutet (N = 53), Turku PET centre (N = 62) and Yale University PET Center (N = 25). The total volume of distribution (V-T) was estimated in global grey matter, frontal, temporal, occipital and parietal cortices, hippocampus and thalamus using multilinear analysis 1. The effects of age, BMI and sex on TSPO availability were investigated using linear mixed effects model, with TSPO genotype and PET centre specified as random intercepts. Results There were significant positive correlations between age and V-T in the frontal and temporal cortex. BMI showed a significant negative correlation with V-T in all regions. Additionally, significant differences between males and females were observed in all regions, with females showing higher V-T. A subgroup analysis revealed a positive correlation between V-T and age in all regions in male subjects, whereas age showed no effect on TSPO levels in female subjects. Conclusion These findings provide evidence that individual biological properties may contribute significantly to the high variation shown in TSPO binding estimates, and suggest that age, BMI and sex can be confounding factors in clinical studies.

In mammary carcinoma the highY(1)R density together with its high incidence of 85% in primary human breast cancers and 100% in breast cancer derived lymph node metastases attracted special attention. Therefore, the aim of this study was the development of radioligandsforY(1)R imaging by positron emission tomography (PET) with a special emphasis on imaging agents with reduced lipophilicity to provide a PET ligand with improved biodistribution in comparison with previously published tracers targeting theY(1)R. Three new radioligands based on BIBP3226, bearing an F-18-fluoroethoxy linker (12), an F-18-PEG-linker (13) or an F-18-fluoroglycosyl moiety (11) were radiosynthesised in high radioactivity yields. The new radioligands displayedY(1)R affinities of 2.8 nM (12), 29 nM (13) and 208 nM (11) and were characterised in vitro regarding binding to human breast cancer MCF-7-Y1 cells and slices of tumour xenografts. In vivo, small animal PET studies were conducted in nude mice bearing MCF-7-Y1 tumours. The binding to tumours, solid tumour slices and tumour cells correlated well with theY(1)R affinities. Although 12 and 13 showed displaceable and specific binding toY(1)R in vitro and in vivo, the radioligands still need to be optimised to achieve higher tumour-to-background ratios forY(1)R imaging by PET.Yet the present study is another step towards an optimized PET radioligand for imaging ofY(1)R in vivo.

Absorbed doses to the blood were calculated using integrated time-activity curves of the blood and the whole-body. For DSB quantification, leucocytes were isolated, fixed in ethanol and immunostained with -H2AX and 53BP1 antibodies. Colocalizing foci of both DSB markers were manually counted in a fluorescence microscope.ResultsThe average number of radiation-induced foci (RIF) per cell increased within the first 4h after administration, followed by a decrease indicating DNA repair. The number of RIF during the first 2.6h correlated linearly with the absorbed dose to the blood (R-2=0.58), in good agreement with previously published in-vitro data. At late time-points (48 h and 96h after administration), the number of RIF correlated linearly with the absorbed dose rate (R-2=0.56). In most patients, DNA DSBs were repaired effectively. However, in some patients RIF did not disappear completely even 96h after administration.ConclusionThe general pattern of the time- and dose-dependent induction and disappearance of RIF during Lu-177-PSMA therapy is similar to that of other radionuclide therapies.

Duloxetine is a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that has been widely used for the treatment of depression. However, the relationship between dose and plasma concentration of duloxetine and norepinephrine transporter occupancy in the human brain has not been determined. In this study, we examined norepinephrine transporter occupancy by different doses of duloxetine. Methods: We calculated norepinephrine transporter occupancies from 2 positron emission tomography scans using (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 before and after a single oral dose of duloxetine (20 mg, n = 3; 40 mg, n = 3; 60 mg, n = 2). Positron emission tomography scans were performed from 120 to 180 minutes after an i.v. bolus injection of (S,S)-[F-18] FMeNER-D-2. Venous blood samples were taken to measure the plasma concentration of duloxetine just before and after the second positron emission tomography scan. Results: Norepinephrine transporter occupancy by duloxetine was 29.7% at 20 mg, 30.5% at 40 mg, and 40.0% at 60 mg. The estimated dose of duloxetine inducing 50% norepinephrine transporter occupancy was 76.8 mg, and the estimated plasma drug concentration inducing 50% norepinephrine transporter occupancy was 58.0 ng/mL. Conclusions: Norepinephrine transporter occupancy by clinical doses of duloxetine was approximately 30% to 40% in human brain as estimated using positron emission tomography with (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2.

PFASs can compete with thyroxine (T4) for binding to the human thyroid hormone transport protein transthyretin (TTR) which may lead to reduce thyroid hormone levels leading to endocrine disrupting adverse effects. Environmental fate and endocrine-disrupting activity of PFASs has initiated several research projects, but the amount of experimental data available for these pollutants is limited. In this study, experimental data for T4-TTR competing potency of 24 PFASs obtained in a radioligand-binding assay were modeled using classification- and regression-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) tools with simple molecular descriptors obtained from chemical structure of these compounds in order to identify the responsible structural features and fragments of the studied PFASs for endocrine disruption activity. Additionally, docking studies were performed employing the crystal structure complex of TTR with bound 2', 6'-difluorobiphenyl-4-carboxylic acid (PDB: 2F7I) in order to constitute the receptor model for human TTR. The results corroborate evidence for these binding interactions and indicate multiple high-affinity modes of binding. The developed in silico models therefore advance our understanding of important structural attributes of these chemicals and may provide important information for the design of future synthesis of PFASs as well as may serve as an efficient query tool for virtual screening of large PFAS databases to check their endocrine toxicity profile.

The influence of the <i>rs6295</i> gene polymorphism on serotonin-1A receptor distribution investigated with PET in patients with major depression applying machine learning	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; 5-HT1A RECEPTOR; ANTIDEPRESSANT RESPONSE; 1A BINDING; IN-VIVO; HETERORECEPTOR COMPLEXES; C(-1019)G POLYMORPHISM; PROMOTER POLYMORPHISM; AMYGDALA REACTIVITY; DNA METHYLATION	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common neuropsychiatric disease and despite extensive research, its genetic substrate is still not sufficiently understood. The common polymorphism rs6295 of the serotonin-1A receptor gene (HTR1A) is affecting the transcriptional regulation of the 5-HT1A receptor and has been closely linked to MDD. Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) exploiting advances in data mining and statistics by using machine learning in 62 healthy subjects and 19 patients with MDD, which were scanned with PET using the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635. All the subjects were genotyped for rs6295 and genotype was grouped in GG vs C allele carriers. Mixed model was applied in a ROI-based (region of interest) approach. ROI binding potential (BPND) was divided by dorsal raphe BPND as a specific measure to highlight rs6295 effects (BPDiv). Mixed model produced an interaction effect of ROI and genotype in the patients' group but no effects in healthy controls. Differences of BPDiv was demonstrated in seven ROIs; parahippocampus, hippocampus, fusiform gyrus, gyrus rectus, supplementary motor area, inferior frontal occipital gyrus and lingual gyrus. For classification of genotype, 'RandomForest' and Support Vector Machines were used, however, no model with sufficient predictive capability could be computed. Our results are in line with preclinical data, mouse model knockout studies as well as previous clinical analyses, demonstrating the two-pronged effect of the G allele on 5-HT1A BPND for, we believe, the first time. Future endeavors should address epigenetic effects and allosteric heteroreceptor complexes. Replication in larger samples of MDD patients is necessary to substantiate our findings.

Furthermore, metabotropic glutamate receptors have been previously reported to be impaired in brain from AD patients. Metabotropic glutamate S (mGlu(5)) receptors are G-protein coupled receptors proposed as potential targets for therapy of different neurodegenerative disorders. Thus, MPEP (2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride), a selective noncompetitive mGlus receptor antagonist, has been suggested for pharmacological treatment of AD. The aim of the present work was to quantify mGlu(5) receptors in brain from zebrafish and to study the possible modulation of these receptors by MPEP treatment. To this end, radioligand binding assay and open field test were used. Results showed a slightly higher presence of mGlus receptors in brain from male than in that from female zebrafish. However, a significant increase of mGlu(5) receptor in male without variation in female was observed after MPEP treatment. This gender specific response was also observed in locomotor behavior, being significantly decreased only in male zebrafish. These results confirm the presence of mGlu(5) receptors in brain from zebrafish and their gender specific modulation by selective antagonist treatment and suggest a role of these receptors on locomotor activity, which is affected in many disorders. In addition, our data point to zebrafish as a useful model to study mGlu receptor function in both healthy and pathological conditions.

In this study, we investigated the availability of a radioiodinated imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine derivative, termed I-125-DRK092, as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) ligand for in vivo detection of A beta deposition. DRK092 showed high binding affinity for either synthetic human A beta fibrils or brain homogenates from amyloid precursor protein transgenic (Tg) mouse (PS1-ki/JU-Tg2576) and AD patient with a dissociation constant (K-d) of one-digit nM, and excellent brain permeability (peak value of uptake: approximately 0.9% of injection dose/g rat brain). Ex vivo autoradiographic analysis showed that measurement with I-125-DRK092 has higher sensibility for detecting A beta accumulation than with I-125-IMPY, a well-known amyloid SPECT ligand, in Tg mice. In vitro autoradiography with I-125-DRK092 also confirmed higher accumulation of radioactivity in the cortical area, enriched with A beta plaques, of Tg mouse and AD patient brains, as compared with the corresponding areas in non-Tg mouse and healthy control brains. All the data presented above lead us to draw the conclusion that radioiodinated DRK092 is a potential SPECT ligand for amyloid imaging in AD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, little is known about the neurobiology of this endophenotype and no known in vivo molecular imaging study has been conducted to evaluate candidate receptor systems that may be implicated in this endophenotype or the phenotypic expression of trauma-related psychopathology that comprises threat (ie, re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal) and loss (ie, emotional numbing, depression/dysphoria, generalized anxiety) symptomatology. Using the radioligand [C-11]OMAR and positron emission tomography (PET), we evaluated the relationship between in vivo cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) receptor availability in the amygdala, and performance on a dot-probe measure of attentional bias to threat, and clinician interview-based measures of trauma-related psychopathology. The sample comprised adults presenting with a broad spectrum of trauma-related psychopathology, ranging from nontrauma-exposed, psychiatrically healthy adults to trauma-exposed adults with severe trauma-related psychopathology. Results revealed that increased CB1 receptor availability in the amygdala was associated with increased attentional bias to threat, as well as increased severity of threat, but not loss, symptomatology; greater peripheral anandamide levels were associated with decreased attentional bias to threat. A mediation analysis further suggested that attentional bias to threat mediated the relationship between CB1 receptor availability in the amygdala and severity of threat symptomatology. These data substantiate a key role for compromised endocannabinoid function in mediating both the endophenotypic and phenotypic expression of threat symptomatology in humans. They further suggest that novel pharmacotherapies that target the CB1 system may provide a more focused, mechanism-based approach to mitigating this core aspect of trauma-related psychopathology.

J	Waser, B; Reubi, JC				Waser, Beatrice; Reubi, Jean Claude			Radiolabelled GLP-1 receptor antagonist binds to GLP-1 receptor-expressing human tissues	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Human tumours; GLP-1 receptors; Exendin(9-39) antagonist; Tumour targeting; Peptide receptors	GLUCAGON-LIKE PEPTIDE-1; INSULINOMAS; AGONIST; TUMORS	Purpose Radiolabelled glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have recently been shown to successfully image benign insulinomas in patients. For the somatostatin receptor targeting of tumours, however, it was recently reported that antagonist tracers were superior to agonist tracers. The present study therefore evaluated various forms of the (125)iodinated-Bolton-Hunter (BH)-exendin(9-39) antagonist tracer for the in vitro visualization of GLP-1 receptor-expressing tissues in rats and humans and compared it with the agonist tracer I-125-GLP-1(7-36)amide. Methods Receptor autoradiography studies with I-125-GLP-1(7-36)amide agonist or I-125-BH-exendin(9-39) antagonist radioligands were performed in human and rat tissues. Results The antagonist I-125-BH-exendin(9-39) labelled at lysine 19 identifies all human and rat GLP-1 target tissues and GLP-1 receptor-expressing tumours. Binding is of high affinity and is comparable in all tested tissues in its binding properties with the agonist tracer I-125-GLP-1(7-36)amide. For comparison, I-125-BH-exendin(9-39) with the BH labelled at lysine 4 did identify the GLP-1 receptor in rat tissues but not in human tissues. Conclusion The GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin(9-39) labelled with I-125-BH at lysine 19 is an excellent GLP-1 radioligand that identifies human and rat GLP-1 receptors in normal and tumoural tissues. It may therefore be the molecular basis to develop suitable GLP-1 receptor antagonist radioligands for in vivo imaging of GLP-1 receptor-expressing tissues in patients.

Exogenous CCK administration has been used in animal models to study pancreatitis and also as a promoter of carcinogen-induced or Kras-driven pancreatic cancer. Defining CCK receptors in normal human pancreas has been problematic because of its retroperitoneal location, high concentrations of pancreatic proteases, and endogenous RNase. Most studies indicate that the predominant receptor in human pancreas is the CCK-B type, and CCK-A is the predominant form in rodent pancreas. In pancreatic cancer cells and tumors, the role of CCK is better established because receptors are often overexpressed by these cancer cells and stimulation of such receptors promotes growth. Furthermore, in established cancer, endogenous production of CCK and/or gastrin occurs and their actions stimulate the synthesis of more receptors plus growth by an autocrine mechanism. Initially it was thought that the mechanism by which CCK served to potentiate carcinogenesis was by interplay with inflammation in the pancreatic microenvironment. But with the recent findings of CCK receptors on early PanIN (pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia) lesions and on stellate cells, the question has been raised that perhaps CCK actions are not the result of cancer but an early driving promoter of cancer. This review will summarize what is known regarding CCK, its receptors, and pancreatic cancer, and also what is unknown and requires further investigation to determine which comes first, the chicken or the egg, "CCK or the cancer."

In vitro, the potencies of slowly associating agonists may be underestimated in assays capturing transient signaling events. When divergent receptor-mediated signaling pathways are evaluated using combinations of equilibrium and transient assays, potency differences driven by kinetics may be erroneously interpreted as biased signaling. In vivo, drugs with slow dissociation rates may display prolonged physiologic effects inconsistent with their pharmacokinetic profiles. We evaluated a panel of 5-hydroxytryptamine(2B) (5-HT2B) receptor agonists in kinetic radioligand binding assays and in transient, calcium flux assays, and inositol phosphate accumulation assays; two functional readouts emanating from G alpha(q)-mediated activation of phospholipase C. In binding studies, ergot derivatives demonstrated slow receptor association and dissociation rates, resulting in significantly reduced potency in calcium assays relative to inositol phosphate accumulation assays. Ergot potencies for activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 were also highly time-dependent. A number of ergots produced wash-resistant 5-HT2B signaling that persisted for many hours without appreciable loss of potency, which was not explained simply by slow receptor-dissociation kinetics. Mechanistic studies indicated that persistent signaling originated from internalized or sequestered receptors. This study provides a mechanistic basis for the long durations of action in vivo and wash-resistant effects in ex vivo tissue models often observed for ergots. The 5-HT2B agonist activity of a number of ergot-derived therapeutics has been implicated in development of cardiac valvulopathy in man. The novel, sustained nature of ergot signaling reported here may represent an additional mechanism contributing to the valvulopathic potential of these compounds.

These compounds, structurally similar to methamphetamine (METH) and 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cause tachycardia, hallucinations and psychosis. We hypothesized that these potentially neurotoxic and abused compounds display differences in their transporter and receptor interactions as compared to amphetamine counterparts. 3,4-Methylenedioxypyrovalerone and naphyrone had high affinity for radioligand binding sites on recombinant human dopamine (hDAT), serotonin (hSERT) and norepinephrine (hNET) transporters, potently inhibited [H-3]neurotransmitter uptake, and, like cocaine, did not induce transporter-mediated release. Butylone was a lower affinity uptake inhibitor. In contrast, 4-fluoromethcathinone, mephedrone and methylone had higher inhibitory potency at uptake compared to binding and generally induced release of preloaded [H-3]neurotransmitter from hDAT, hSERT and hNET (highest potency at hNET), and thus are transporter substrates, similar to METH and MDMA. At hNET, 4-fluoromethcathinone was a more efficacious releaser than METH. These substituted methcathinones had low uptake inhibitory potency and low efficacy at inducing release via human vesicular monoamine transporters (hVMAT2). These compounds were low potency (1) h5-HT1A receptor partial agonists, (2) h5-HT2A receptor antagonists, (3) weak h5-HT2c receptor antagonists. This is the first report on aspects of substituted methcathinone efficacies at serotonin (5-HT) receptors and in superfusion release assays. Additionally, the drugs had no affinity for dopamine receptors, and high-nanomolar to mid-micromolar affinity for hSigmal receptors. Thus, direct interactions with hVMAT2 and serotonin, dopamine, and hSigmal receptors may not explain psychoactive effects. The primary mechanisms of action may be as inhibitors or substrates of DAT, SERT and NET.

Long-Term Stimulant Treatment Affects Brain Dopamine Transporter Level in Patients with Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; METHYLPHENIDATE TREATMENT; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; ORAL METHYLPHENIDATE; COCAINE; RATS; ADULTS; ADHD; STRIATUM; EXPOSURE	Objective: Brain dopamine dysfunction in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) could explain why stimulant medications, which increase dopamine signaling, are therapeutically beneficial. However while the acute increases in dopamine induced by stimulant medications have been associated with symptom improvement in ADHD the chronic effects have not been investigated. Method: We used positron emission tomography and [C-11] cocaine (dopamine transporter radioligand) to measure dopamine transporter availability in the brains of 18 never-medicated adult ADHD subjects prior to and after 12 months of treatment with methylphenidate and in 11 controls who were also scanned twice at 12 months interval but without stimulant medication. Dopamine transporter availability was quantified as non-displaceable binding potential using a kinetic model for reversible ligands. Results: Twelve months of methylphenidate treatment increased striatal dopamine transporter availability in ADHD (caudate, putamen and ventral striatum: +24%, p<0.01); whereas there were no changes in control subjects retested at 12-month interval. Comparisons between controls and ADHD participants revealed no significant difference in dopamine transporter availability prior to treatment but showed higher dopamine transporter availability in ADHD participants than control after long-term treatment (caudate: p<0.007; putamen: p<0.005). Conclusion: Upregulation of dopamine transporter availability during long- term treatment with methylphenidate may decrease treatment efficacy and exacerbate symptoms while not under the effects of the medication. Our findings also suggest that the discrepancies in the literature regarding dopamine transporter availability in ADHD participants (some studies reporting increases, other no changes and other decreases) may reflect, in part, differences in treatment histories.

L-SP5 ((L)(SVSVGMKPSPRP)) is a peptide that recognizes tumor neovasculature but not normal blood vessels (Lee et al., Cancer Res. 2007, 67, 10958-65). The current report presents the design and application of D-SP5 ((D)(PRPSPKMGVSVS)), a novel retro-inverso analogue of L-SP5. Peptides D-SP5 and parental L-SP5 are shown to compete for the same target sites of a yet unknown cellular target and possess a dual-targeting bioactivity for both activated endothelial cells (HUVEC) and several tumor cell lines. Cellular uptake experiments showed superior in vitro targeting abilities of D-SP5 compared with L-SP5, such as enhanced internalization into stimulated HUVEC or KB, U87, and SGC tumor cells. A radioligand receptor binding assay revealed a higher cell affinity of D-SP5 in all tested cell lines, with K-d values for D-SP5 about 2-fold lower than for L-SP5. An up to 3-fold higher maximum binding capacity (B-max) to cells of D-SP5 was noted. Fluorescein-labeled D-SP5 upon intravenous administration displayed strong association with tumor endothelium. D-SP5-conjugated PEG-DSPE micelles displayed enhanced tumor homing (evidenced by near infrared in vivo imaging). When loaded with doxorubicin, D-SP5 micelles could markedly suppress tumor growth with higher efficacy than L-SP5 micelles both in vitro and in vivo in KB tumor xenografts. In summary, the data demonstrate that D-SP5 displays higher binding affinities toward tumor endothelium as well as tumor cells and enhanced tumor targeting capability in vitro and in vivo.

The purpose of this study were to verify the metabolic stability of [18F]MeFWAY, to measure the degree of defluorination of [18F]MeFWAY in vivo, to investigate methods of inhibition of defluorination of [18F]MeFWAY, and to assess the efficacy of [18F]MeFWAY in rat brains in vivo. Methods: MicroPET experiments in rats were conducted to confirm the distribution of radioactivity in the brain. Nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex were also analyzed. Miconazole and fluconazole were tested for the ability to suppress defluorination of [18F]MeFWAY. We conducted a blockade and displacement experiment by treating with WAY-100635. Results: In vitro stability tests showed that MeFWAY was very stable in serum for 6 h, but PET revealed that authentic [18F]MeFWAY underwent significant defluorination in vivo. In vitro inhibition study against decreasing parent activity in liver microsomes, miconazole and fluconazole suppressed metabolic elimination of MeFWAY. However, in the PET study, fluconazole showed more potent inhibitory activity than miconazole. In the suppression of metabolizing enzymes using fluconazole, radioactivity in skull was dramatically decreased by 81% (compared with 69% with miconazole) and it was coupled with an increase in brain uptake. Moreover, BPND in hippocampus was 5.53 and 2.66 in frontal cortex. The blockade and displacement study showed the specificity of [18F]MeFWAY to 5-HT1A receptors.

Patients and Methods: Four patients with homonymous hemianopia and 15 healthy subjects were examined using PET to measure cerebral glucose metabolism, C-11-flumazenil (FMZ) binding to the central benzodiazepine receptor, and MPDX binding to A1R. Left and right regions of interest (ROIs) were selected, and semiquantitative data on the 3 kinds of PET examinations were obtained. The ROIs were referenced using the data for homologous regions in the contralateral hemisphere [ipsilateral/contralateral (I/C) ratio]. Results: The I/C ratios for cerebral glucose metabolism and FMZ binding were low in the primary visual cortex (PVC) and visual association cortex in all the patients, whereas MPDX binding increased in the PVC in patients 1 and 2. Patients 1 and 2 experienced improvement in their visual field after 1 year. However, the other 2 patients showed no changes. We observed an increase in MPDX binding to A1R in the injured portion of the PVC in the patients who recovered. Conclusions: Evaluation of A1R by MPDX-PET may be useful for predicting prognosis and understanding the compensatory and reorganization processes in hemianopia caused by organic brain damage.

Methylene blue inhibits function of the 5-HT transporter	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						5-HT transporter; methylene blue; HEK-293 cells	SPATIALLY-RESOLVED ANALYSIS; SEROTONIN TOXICITY; NITRIC-OXIDE; FLUORESCENT SUBSTRATE; REAL-TIME; RECEPTORS; MICE; PARATHYROIDECTOMY; ENCEPHALOPATHY; LOCALIZATION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Methylene blue (MB) is commonly employed as a treatment for methaemoglobinaemia, malaria and vasoplegic shock. An increasing number of studies indicate that MB can cause 5-HT toxicity when administered with a 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. MB is a potent inhibitor of monoamine oxidases, but other targets that may contribute to MB toxicity have not been identified. Given the role of the 5-HT transporter (SERT) in the regulation of extracellular 5-HT concentrations, the present study aimed to characterize the effect of MB on SERT. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Live cell imaging, in conjunction with the fluorescent SERT substrate 4-(4-(dimethylamino)-styryl)-N-methylpyridinium (ASP+), [ 3H] 5-HT uptake and whole-cell patch-clamp techniques were employed to examine the effects of MB on SERT function. KEY RESULTS In EM4 cells expressing GFP-tagged human SERT (hSERT), MB concentration-dependently inhibited ASP+ accumulation (IC50: 1.4 +/- 0.3 mM). A similar effect was observed in N2A cells. Uptake of [ 3H] 5-HT was decreased by MB pretreatment. Furthermore, patch-clamp studies in hSERT expressing cells indicated that MB significantly inhibited 5-HT-evoked ion currents. Pretreatment with 8-Br-cGMP did not alter the inhibitory effect of MB on hSERT activity, and intracellular Ca2+ levels remained unchanged during MB application. Further experiments revealed that ASP+ binding to cell surface hSERT was reduced after MB treatment. In whole-cell radioligand experiments, exposure to MB (10 mM; 10 min) did not alter surface binding of the SERT ligand [ 125I] RTI-55. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS MB modulated SERT function and suggested that SERT may be an additional target upon which MB acts to produce 5-HT toxicity.

Muscarinic Receptor Occupancy and Cognitive Impairment: A PET Study with [<SUP>11</SUP>C](+)3-MPB and Scopolamine in Conscious Monkeys	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						muscarinic receptor; scopolamine; cognition; monkey; PET	PEDUNCULOPONTINE TEGMENTAL NUCLEUS; MATCHING-TO-SAMPLE; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; IN-VIVO; CHOLINERGIC-RECEPTORS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; BRAIN-STEM; RECOGNITION MEMORY; DOPAMINE-RECEPTORS	The muscarinic cholinergic receptor (mAChR) antagonist scopolamine was used to induce transient cognitive impairment in monkeys trained in a delayed matching to sample task. The temporal relationship between the occupancy level of central mAChRs and cognitive impairment was determined. Three conscious monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were subjected to positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the mAChR radioligand N-[C-11]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([C-11](+)3-MPB). The scan sequence was pre-, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h post-intramuscular administration of scopolamine in doses of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg. Occupancy levels of mAChR were maximal 2 h post-scopolamine in cortical regions innervated primarily by the basal forebrain, thalamus, and brainstem, showing that mAChR occupancy levels were 43-59 and 65-89% in doses of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, dose-dependent impairment of working memory performance was measured 2 h after scopolamine. A positive correlation between the mAChR occupancy and cognitive impairment 2 and 6 h post-scopolamine was the greatest in the brainstem (P < 0.00001). Although cognitive impairment was not observed 24 h post-scopolamine, sustained mAChR occupancy (11-24%) was found with both doses in the basal forebrain and thalamus, but not in the brainstem. These results indicate that a significant degree of mAChRs occupancy is needed to produce cognitive impairment by scopolamine. Furthermore, the importance of the brainstem cholinergic system in working memory in monkey is described.

PHYLOGENETIC DIVERSITY AND FUNCTIONAL EFFICACY OF THE C-TERMINALLY EXPRESSED HEPTAPEPTIDE UNIT IN THE OPIOID PRECURSOR POLYPEPTIDE PROENKEPHALIN A	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Met-enkephalin-Arg-Phe; endogenous opioids; proenkephalin; evolution; chemical biodiversity; natural peptide library	MET-ENKEPHALIN; PEPTIDASE INHIBITORS; SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS; LEU-ENKEPHALIN; BINDING-SITES; SELECTIVITY PROFILES; TISSUE DISTRIBUTION; LUNGFISH BRAIN; ORPHANIN-FQ; RECEPTORS	The heptapeptide Met-enkephalin-Arg(6)-Phe(7) (MERF) with the sequence of YGGFMRF is a potent endogenous opioid located at the C-terminus of proenkephalin-A (PENK), the common polypeptide precursor of Met- and Leu-enkephalin. Our systematic bioinformatic survey revealed considerable sequence polymorphism at the heptapeptide region of different PENK prepropeptides among 56 vertebrate animals. Four orthologous heptapeptides with single or double amino acid replacements were identified among 15 animals, such as YGGFMGY (zebrafish), YGGFMRY (newt), YGGFMKF (hedge-hog tenrek) and YGGFMRI (mudpuppy). Each novel heptapeptide, together with the mammalian consensus MERF and Met-enkephalin, were chemically synthesized and subjected to functionality studies, using radioligand binding competition and G-protein activation assays in rat brain membranes. Equilibrium binding affinities changed from good to modest as measured by receptor type selective [H-3]opioid radioligands. The relative affinities of the heptapeptides reveal slight mu-receptor (MOP) preference over the delta-receptors (DOP). [S-35]GTP gamma S assay, which measures the agonist-mediated G-protein activation, has demonstrated that all the novel heptapeptides were also potent in stimulating the regulatory G-proteins. All peptides were effective in promoting the agonist induced internalization of the green fluorescence protein-tagged human mu-opioid receptor (hMOP-EGFP) stably expressed in HEK293 cells. Thus, the C-terminally processed PENK heptapeptide orthologs exhibited satisfactory bioactivities, moreover they represent further members of the so-called "natural combinatorial neuropeptide library" emerged by evolution.

Increased Serotonin 2A Receptor Availability in the Orbitofrontal Cortex of Physically Aggressive Personality Disordered Patients	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Aggression; intermittent explosive disorder; orbitofrontal cortex; personality disorder; positron emission tomography; serotonin	5-HT2A RECEPTORS; ABNORMAL AGGRESSION; LEARNED HELPLESSNESS; IMPULSIVE AGGRESSION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MESSENGER-RNA; DOUBLE-BLIND; FLUOXETINE; BEHAVIOR; BINDING	Background: Impulsive physical aggression is a common and problematic feature of many personality disorders. The serotonergic system is known to be involved in the pathophysiology of aggression, and multiple lines of evidence have implicated the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). We sought to examine the role of the 5-HT2AR in impulsive aggression specifically in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), given that our own studies and an extensive literature indicate that serotonergic disturbances in the OFC are linked to aggression. We have previously hypothesized that increased 5-HT2AR function in the OFC is a state phenomenon that promotes impulsive aggression. Methods: Serotonin 2A receptor availability was measured with positron emission tomography and the selective 5-HT2AR antagonist radioligand [C-11]MDL100907 in two groups of impulsively aggressive personality disordered patients-14 with current physical aggression, and 15 without current physical aggression-and 25 healthy control subjects. Clinical ratings of various symptom dimensions were also obtained. Results: Orbitofrontal 5-HT2AR availability was greater in patients with current physical aggression compared with patients without current physical aggression and healthy control subjects; no differences in OFC 5-HT2AR availability were observed between patients without current physical aggression and healthy control subjects. No significant differences in 5-HT2AR availability were observed in other brain regions examined. Among both groups of impulsively aggressive personality disordered patients combined, OFC 5-HT2AR availability was correlated, specifically, with a state measure of impulsive aggression. Conclusions: These findings are consistent with our previously described model in which impulsive aggression is related to dynamic changes in 5-HT2AR function in the OFC.

One approach to the development of subtype-selective agents is the in silico docking of potential ligands to the receptors in quantitative molecular modeling studies. Because the crystal structure of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptors is not known, we used homology modeling based on the published structure of bovine rhodopsin. We developed individual models for each of the three receptors, which were found to accurately represent published data from both radioligand binding mutagenesis experiments. Using 18 non-subtype-selective agents to validate the models, the calculated transformed and the experimental binding free energies were satisfactory correlated (r(A)(2) = 0.888, r(B)(2) = 0.887, r(C)(2) = 0.790). The binding pockets differed in size (482-619 angstrom(3)) with the alpha(2B) receptor subtype having the largest and the alpha(2C) the smallest cavity. The binding sites for all three subtypes were found to be essentially identical with the exception of two subtype-specific residues, and thus we were unable to identify any significant differences in the interactions of ligands with the three receptor subtypes. Although, the binding properties of all three receptors are very similar, the differences in pocket volume and two subtype-specific residues in the binding pocket might play an as yet undocumented role in subtype selectivity.

Pulp and Paper Mill Effluents Contain Neuroactive Substances That Potentially Disrupt Neuroendocrine Control of Fish Reproduction	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article							GOLDFISH CARASSIUS-AURATUS; GONADOTROPIN-RELEASING-HORMONE; EXCITATORY AMINO-ACIDS; BLEACHED-KRAFT PULP; IN-VITRO; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; MESSENGER-RNA; PITUITARY; GABA	Here we show for the first time that components of pulp and paper mill effluents contain neuroactive substances that may impair fish reproduction. Grab samples of primary and secondary effluent were obtained from a representative pulp and paper mill in Eastern Canada. Effluents were fractionated using classic polarity and polyphenolic extraction methods into solvents of selected polarities (water, ethanol, ethyl acetate, and hexane). By means of in vitro, competitive assays on goldfish (Carassius auratus) brain tissues, the extracts were screened for their ability to interact with enzymes and receptors involved in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), dopamine, glutamate, and acetylcholine-dependent neurotransmission. These neurotransmission pathways have essential regulatory roles in fish reproduction. Radioligand binding to the following neurotransmitter receptors were significantly impacted following in vitro incubations with extracts (percentage change from controls indicated in brackets): dopamine-2 (D2; 21-48% increase), GABA(A) receptor binding (65-67% decrease and 189% increase), N-mothyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA; 26-75% decrease), and muscarinic cholinergic (mACh; 42% increase). Activities of the following neurotransmitter-related enzymes were significantly impacted: monoamine oxidase (MAO; 14-48% decrease), GABA-transaminase activity (33% decrease and 21-69% increase), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE; 21-50% decrease). No changes in glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) activity were detected. These findings provide a novel and plausible mechanism by which pulp and paper mills effluents impair fish reproduction by interacting with neurotransmitter systems. Further work is required to identify the active compounds and explore whether these changes occur in vivo.

BGC20-1531, a novel, potent and selective prostanoid EP<sub>4</sub> receptor antagonist: a putative new treatment for migraine headache	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						EP4 receptor; PGE(2); migraine; pain	GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; PROSTAGLANDIN E-2; DOUBLE-BLIND; CGRP ANTAGONISTS; ANIMAL-MODELS; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; EFFICACY; RELEASE; SUMATRIPTAN; MECHANISMS	Prostanoid EP4 receptor antagonists may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of migraine since EP4 receptors have been shown to be involved in prostaglandin (PG)E-2-induced cerebral vascular dilatation, which may be an important contributor to migraine pain. This study reports the pharmacological characterization of BGC20-1531, a novel EP4 receptor antagonist. BGC20-1531 was characterized in radioligand binding and in vitro functional assays employing recombinant and native EP4 receptors. Changes in canine carotid haemodynamics were used to assess the pharmacodynamic profile of BGC20-1531 in vivo. BGC20-1531 exhibited high affinity at recombinant human EP4 receptors expressed in cell lines (pK(B) 7.6) and native EP4 receptors in human cerebral and meningeal artery (pK(B) 7.6-7.8) but showed no appreciable affinity at a wide range of other receptors (including other prostanoid receptors), channels, transporters and enzymes (pKi < 5). BGC20-1531 competitively antagonized PGE(2)-induced vasodilatation of human middle cerebral (pK(B) 7.8) and meningeal (pK(B) 7.6) arteries in vitro, but had no effect on responses induced by PGE(2) on coronary, pulmonary or renal arteries in vitro. BGC20-1531 (1-10 mg.kg(-1) i.v.) caused a dose-dependent antagonism of the PGE(2)-induced increase in canine carotid blood flow in vivo. BGC20-1531 is a potent and selective antagonist at EP4 receptors in vitro and in vivo, with the potential to alleviate the symptoms of migraine that result from cerebral vasodilatation. BGC20-1531 is currently in clinical development for the treatment of migraine headache.	[Maubach, K. A.; Hagan, R. M.; Routledge, C.] BTG Int Ltd, London EC4M 7SB, England; [Davis, R.

However, progress in developing such drugs has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of mechanisms involved in substrate turnover. We report here results of a comparative study of human and bovine SSAO enzymes that reveal binding of substrates and other ligands to at least two ( human) and up to four ( bovine) distinct sites on enzyme monomers. Anaerobic spectroscopy reveals binding of substrates ( spermidine and benzylamine) and of an imidazoline site ligand ( clonidine) to the reduced active site of bovine SSAO, whereas interactions with oxidized enzyme are evident in kinetic assays and crystallization studies. Radioligand binding experiments with [H-3]tetraphenylphosphonium, an inhibitor of bovine SSAO that binds to an anionic cavity outside the active site, reveal competition with spermidine, benzylamine, and clonidine, indicating that these ligands also bind to this second anionic region. Kinetic models of bovine SSAO are consistent with one spermidine molecule straddling the active and secondary sites on both oxidized and reduced enzyme, whereas these sites are occupied by two individual molecules of smaller substrates such as benzylamine. Clonidine and other imidazoline site ligands enhance or inhibit activity as a result of differing affinities for both sites on oxidized and reduced enzyme. In contrast, although analyses of kinetic data obtained with human SSAO are also consistent with ligands binding to oxidized and reduced enzyme, we observed no apparent requirement for substrate or modulator binding to any secondary site to model enzyme behavior.

Nude mice bearing HT-29, HCT-116, HCT-15, LoVo and Colo-320DM cancers were treated with cytotoxic LH-RH analogs AN-152 and AN-207 or their respective cytotoxic radicals doxorubicin (DOX) and 2-pyrrolino-DOX (AN-201). The reduction in tumor growth was evaluated, and cell proliferation characteristics as well as apoptosis were analyzed by histological methods. LH-RH receptors on the tumors were investigated by radioligand binding assays and their mRNA expression by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). All 5 colorectal cancer lines expressed high affinity binding sites for LH-RH, and mRNA for the LH-RH receptors. Both cytotoxic LH-RH analogs AN-152 and AN-207 powerfully inhibited growth of all colon cancers. AN-207 had the strongest effect on HT-29 and HCT-116 tumors, and AN-152 was the most effective on Colo-320DM cancers. Cytotoxic radicals AN-201 and DOX were less effective on these 3 tumors, but had effects similar to AN-152 and AN-207 on HCT-15 and LoVo carcinomas. The four cytotoxic compounds also differently affected apoptosis and proliferation rate of the various tumor lines. Our findings suggest that cytotoxic LH-RH analogs should be considered for the therapy of patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.

Serotonin transporter binding in bipolar disorder assessed using [<SUP>11</SUP>C]DASB and positron emission tomography	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						bipolar disorder; positron emission tomography; serotonin transporter; [C-11]DASB	5-HT UPTAKE SITES; TRITIATED IMIPRAMINE BINDING; AGE-RELATED DECLINE; HUMAN-BRAIN; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SUICIDE VICTIMS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; MESSENGER-RNA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IN-VITRO	Background. Evidence from neuroimaging post-mortem, and genetic studies suggests that bipolar disorder (BD) is associated with abnormalities of the serotonin-transporter (5-HTT) system. Because of various limitations of these studies, however, it has remained unclear whether 5-HTT binding is abnormal in unmedicated BD-subjects. This study used PET and [C-11]DASB, a radioligand that afforded higher sensitivity and specificity for the 5-HTT than previously available radioligands, to compare 5-HTT binding between BD and control subjects. Methods: The 5-HTT binding-potential (BP) was assessed in 18 currently-depressed, unmedicated BD-subjects and 3 7 healthy controls using PET and [C-11]DASB. Results. In BD, the mean 5-HTTBP was increased in thalamus, dorsal cingulate cortex (DCC) medial prefrontal cortex and insula and decreased in the brainstem at the level of the pontine raphe-nuclei. Anxiety ratings correlated positively with 5-HTTBP in insula and DCC, and BP in these regions was higher in subjects manifesting pathological obsessions and compulsions relative to BD-subjects lacking such symptoms. Subjects with a history of suicide attempts showed reduced 5-HTT binding in the midbrain and increased binding in anterior cingulate cortex versus controls and to BD-subjects without attempts. Conclusions: This is the first study to report abnormalities in 5-HTT binding in unmedicated BD-subjects. The direction of abnormality in the brainstem was opposite to that found in the cortex, thalamus, and striatum. Elevated 5-HTT binding in the cortex may be related to anxiety symptoms and syndromes associated with BD.

Some allosteric muscarinic ligands are "atypical", having steep concentration-effect curves and not interacting competitively with "typical" allosteric modulators. For atypical agents, a second allosteric site has been proposed. Different approaches have been used to gain further insight into the interaction with M-2 receptors of two atypical agents, tacrine and the bispyridinium compound 4,4'-bis-[(2,6-dichloro-benzyloxy-imino)-methyl]-1,1'-propane-1,3-diyl- bispyridinium dibromide (Duo3). Interaction studies, using radioligand binding assays and the allosteric ligands obidoxime, Mg2+ , and the new tool hexamethonium to antagonize the allosteric actions of the atypical ligands, showed different modes of interaction for tacrine and Duo3 at M-2 receptors. A negatively cooperative interaction was observed between hexamethonium and tacrine ( but not Duo3). A tacrine dimer that exhibited increased allosteric potency relative to tacrine but behaved like a typical allosteric modulator was competitively inhibited by hexamethonium. M-2/M-5-receptor mutants revealed a dependence of tacrine and Duo3 affinity on different receptor epitopes. This was confirmed by docking simulations using a three-dimensional model of the M-2 receptor. These showed that the allosteric site could accommodate two molecules of tacrine simultaneously but only one molecule of Duo3, which binds in different mode from typical allosteric agents. Therefore, the atypical actions of tacrine and Duo3 involve different modes of receptor interaction, but their sites of attachment seem to be the "common" allosteric binding domain at the entrance to the orthosteric ligand binding pocket of the M-2-receptor. Additional complex behavior may be rationalized by allosteric interactions transmitted within a receptor dimer.

To this aim, we used an intracerebral beta(+)-sensitive probe as a highly sensitive system to quantify the radioligand activity using a single three-injection experimental paradigm. The study was divided into three main parts: (i) [C-11]raclopride catabolism evaluation without and with cimetidine pretreatment (cytochrome P-450 inhibitor); (ii) quantification of kinetics parameters in the striatum, enthorinal cortex, and cerebellum of living rats using a three-compartment model with an arterial input function; (iii) correlation study of in vivo and in vitro binding density and affinity values in the same striatal tissues. (i) raclopride catabolism was very reproducible between individuals; cimetidine pre-treatment resulted in a 30% reduction of raclopride metabolites. (ii) D-2 striatal B'(max). and KdVr estimates obtained by compartmental modelling were 19.87 +/- 6.45 and 6.2 +/- 3.3nmol/L, respectively. Cerebellum is the best candidate as a reference region with no specific binding detectable in vivo. (iii) When comparing density (B-max/B'(max)) and affinity (K-d/KdVr) values in vivo and in vitro for each striatum, a high strict correlation was found (r(2)=0.90 and 0.72, for density and affinity, respectively). These results validate the multi-injection modelling approach coupled to beta-microprobe acquisitions as a mean to provide accurate and separate estimates of dopamine D-2-receptor density and affinity, in the living rodent striatum.

Cardiac inotropy is primarily regulated by (beta(1)-ARs. However, alpha(1)-ARs may play an important role in inotropy during heart failure. Previous work has suggested that the alpha(1B)-AR modulates beta(1)-AR function in the heart. The potential role of the alpha(1A)-AR has not been previously studied. We used transgenic mice that express constitutively active mutant (CAM) forms of the alpha(1A)-AR or alpha(1B)-AR regulated by their endogenous promoters. Expression of the CAM a,A-AR or CAM alpha(1B)-AR had no effect on basal cardiac function (developed pressure, +dP/dT, -dP/dT, heart rate, flow rate). However, both alpha(1)-AR subtypes significantly decreased isoproterenol-stimulated +dP/dT. Pertussis toxin had no effect on +dP/dT in CAM a, A-AR hearts but restored +dP/dT to non-transgenic values in CAM alpha(1B)-AR hearts. Radioligand binding indicated a selective decrease in the density of beta(1)-ARs in both CAM mice. However, G-proteins, cAMP, or the percentage of high and low affinity states were unchanged in either transgenic compared with control. These data demonstrate that CAM alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-ARs both downregulate beta(1)-AR-mediated inotropy in the mouse heart. However, alpha(1)-AR subtypes are coupled to different beta-AR mediated signaling pathways with the alpha(1B)-AR being pertussis toxin sensitive. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To evaluate the selectivity of growth factor binding to heparan sulfate, we conducted a detailed study of the intercompetition of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) binding to heparan sulfate (HS) on bovine aortic smooth muscle cells. Radioligand binding assays were conducted, and an analytical method was developed for determining the apparent binding constants and numbers of specific and shared binding sites within HS. These studies revealed the presence of two general classes of HS-binding sites for FGF-2 and HB-EGF. The major class (similar to 10(6) sites per cell) was able to bind to either growth factor with relatively low affinity (K-d = 12 and 44 nM for FGF-2 and HB-EGF, respectively) and was termed "common" binding sites. However, both FGF-2 and HB-EGF also showed specific high affinity (0.6 and 6.1 nM for FGF-2 and HB-EGF, respectively) binding to a minor subset (118 000 and 28 000 sites per cell for FGF-2 and HB-EGF, respectively) of "unique" binding sites, which were unable to bind the other growth factor. These studies indicate that growth factor binding to HS involves multiple binding sites of variable affinity, density, and selectivity. The approach outlined in this study could be applied to aid in the evaluation of the relative biological roles of these selective and nonselective growth factor binding domains within HS.

[I-125]alpha-conotoxinMII is a radioligand that binds to alpha6, and also alpha3 subunits of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In the present study, we have compared the distribution of [I-125]-conotoxinMII binding in post mortem human tissue from four groups of patients: individuals with dementia with Lewy bodies displaying extra-pyramidal features (DLB + EPF), DLB without extrapyramidal features (DLB - EPF) Parkinson's disease without dementia (PD) and age-matched controls. Reduced binding was observed in the putamen and caudate in PD and both DLB groups. In DLB patients, the decline was greater in DLB + EPF compared to DLB - EPF group. The declines in nicotinic receptor binding in the striatum were in part paralleled by reductions in the striatal dopamine transporter. In the thalamus, [I-125]alpha-conotoxinMII binding was significantly reduced in the centromedian nucleus in both DLB groups, and also in the parafascicular nucleus in the DLB - EPF group. In DLB + EPF and PD patients, there was decreased binding in the ventral lateral nucleus. This study demonstrates alterations of alpha6 and/or alpha3 nAChRs binding in DLB and PD, which are likely to relate to extra-pyramidal symptoms. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the mechanism of this effect is not yet clarified. Using a rat model we have previously demonstrated that SP1-7 affects dopamine transmission and the expression of the dopamine D2-receptor gene transcript in the nucleus accumbens during naloxone precipitated morphine withdrawal. In the present study, we have applied autoradiography to investigate the effect of the heptapeptide on the binding of dopamine D1- and D2-receptors in mesocorticolimbic brain areas of male rats during morphine withdrawal. Morphine dependent animals were treated with an injection of SP1-7 into the ventral tegmental area prior to naloxone challenge. The result indicated that the SP fragment elicited a significant decrease in specific binding to D1-like receptors in the caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens shell, nucleus accumbens core, substantia nigra and medial globus pallidus. Radioligand binding to dopamine D2-like receptors was also altered by SP1-7. The heptapeptide induced a decreased density of these sites in the ventral tegmental area but an increased binding in the substantia nigra and the frontal cortex. The observed alterations in the D1- and D2-like receptor density could reflect activations in dopamine pathways associated with the above-mentioned brain regions. The result provides further evidence for the modulatory effect of SP1-7 on dopamine systems during opioid withdrawal, suggesting the possible role for the heptapeptide to regulate morphine withdrawal reactions.

N-(4-(2-Methoxyphenoxy)-phenyl-N-(2,2,2-trifluoroethylsulfonyl)-pyrid-3-ylmethylamine (LY487379) is a selective positive allosteric modulator at human mGluR2 and is without activity at human mGluR3. Furthermore, LY487379 has no intrinsic agonist or antagonist activity at hmGluR2, as determined by functional guanosine 5'(gamma-[S-35]thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTPgammaS) binding, single-cell Ca2+ imaging, and electrophysiological studies. However, LY487379 markedly potentiated glutamate-stimulated [S-35]GTPgammaS binding in a concentration-dependent manner at hmGluR2, shifting the glutamate dose-response curve leftward by 3-fold and increasing the maximum levels of [S-35]GTPgammaS stimulation. This effect of LY487479 was also observed to a greater extent on the concentration-response curves to selective hmGluR2/3 agonists. In radioligand binding studies to rat cortical membranes, LY487379 increased the affinity of the radiolabeled agonist, [H-3]DCG-IV, without affecting the binding affinity of the radiolabeled antagonist, [H-3]LY341495. In rat hippocampal slices, coapplication of LY487379 potentiated synaptically evoked mGluR2 responses. Finally, to elucidate the site of action, we systematically exchanged segments and single amino acids between hmGluR2 and hmGluR3. Substitution of Ser688 and/or Gly689 in transmembrane IV along with Asn735 located in transmembrane segment V, with the homologous amino acids of hmGluR3, completely eliminated LY487379 allosteric modulation of hmGluR2. We propose that this allosteric binding site defines a pocket that is different from the orthosteric site located in the amino terminal domain.

Clinical signs were recorded in 62 patients, of whom 24 failed standard Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor criteria, and 38 fulfilled UK Brain Bank step I PD criteria. Striatal radioligand uptake was graded visually as normal or abnormal, and specific: nonspecific ratios were calculated. Bradykinesia and rigidity showed significant overall association with abnormal scans (P less than or equal to 0.003), but rest tremor did not (P = NS). In the 24 patients not fulfilling specific criteria (mean age 63 [SD 9] years, disease duration 3 [SD 4] years), 10 (42%) had abnormal visual SPECT assessment and 14 (58%) had normal scans. Of 38 patients with early PD by clinical criteria (mean age 60 [SD 9] years, disease duration 3 [SD 1.7] years), 33 (87%) were visually abnormal. Baseline clinical diagnosis corresponded with SPECT imaging results in 51 of 62 cases (82%), which increased to 56 of 62 cases (90%) with amendment of seven clinical diagnoses at 3 months (blind to SPECT results). Akinetic-rigid cardinal diagnostic features of parkinsonism associate well with dopaminergic deficit in patients with early and mild clinical features. When these clinical features are uncertain, or the patient fails clinical diagnostic criteria, testing for dopaminergic deficit with [I-123]-FP-CIT SPECT may assist the diagnostic process.

The molecular basis of the arrestin-insensitivity of 5-HT2A receptors is unknown but is probably caused, in part, by the apparent lack of agonist-induced 5-HT2A receptor phosphorylation. Because the arrestin-insensitivity of 5-HT2A receptors is cell-type selective, we used a "constitutively active" arrestin mutant that can interact with agonist-activated but nonphosphorylated receptors. We show here that this "constitutively active" arrestin mutant (Arr2-R169E) can force 5-HT2A receptors to be regulated by arrestins. Cotransfection of 5-HT2A receptors with Arr2-R169E induced agonist-independent 5-HT2A receptor internalization, and a constitutive translocation of the Arr2-R169E mutant to the plasma membrane, whereas wild-type Arrestin-2 had no effect. Additionally, Arr2-R169E, unlike wild-type arrestin-2, induced a significant decrease in efficacy of agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis with an unexpected increase in agonist potency. Radioligand binding assays demonstrated that the fraction of receptors in the high-affinity agonist binding-state increased with expression of Arr2-R169E, indicating that Arr2-R169E stabilizes the agonist-high affinity state of the 5-HT2A receptor (R*). Intriguingly, the agonist-independent interaction of Arr2-R169E with 5-HT2A receptors was inhibited by inverse agonist treatment and is thus probably caused by the high level of 5-HT2A receptor constitutive activity. This is the first demonstration that a constitutively active arrestin mutant can both induce agonist-independent internalization and stabilize the agonist-high affinity state of an arrestin-insensitive G protein coupled receptor.

A series of isomeric 4-amino-2-[3-[4-(2-methoxy or nitro phenyl) -1-piperazinyl]propyl]-5-.(substitutedphenyl)-2,4-dihydro-3H[1,2,4]triazole-3-thiones 12a r was also isolated and characterized. New compounds were tested to evaluate their affinity for 5-HT1A receptor and alpha (1)-adrenoceptor in radioligand binding experiments.: As a general trend, triazoles 11a-t showed a preferential affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor whereas isomeric 2,4-dihydro-3H[1,2.4]triazole-3-thiones 12a-r preferentially bind to the al-adrenoceptor site. Several molecules showed affinities in the nanomolar range and 4-amino-3-[3-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]thio]-5-(4-propyloxy-phenyl)[1,2,4]triazole (11o) was the most selective derivative for the 5-HT1A receptor (K-i alpha (1)/K-i 5-HT1A=55). The decrease in 5-HT1A receptor selectivity in 3-[3-[4-(2-nliethoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]propyl]thio]-5-(substitutedphenyl)[1,2,4] triazole 14a-b, lacking in the amino group in 4-position of the triazole ring, in comparison with their analogues in the series 11a-t, suggest that the amino function represents a critical structural feature in determining 5-HT1A receptor selectivity in this class of compounds.

Strain mean B-max values and the known genomic locations of 1390 marker loci were used to carry out a genome-wide search for quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which are chromosomal sites containing genes that influence DAT expression. This search revealed an unusually large effect QTL on chromosome 19 in the region of the proopiomelanocortin pseudogene Pomc-ps1 (8-11 cM), homologous to regions of human chromosomes 9q21 and 11q12-13. This QTL (logarithm of the odds 4.7, df = 1, p = 3 x 10(-6)) by conservative estimates accounts for just over half of the genetic variation in DAT binding site density. The QTL is not the DAT gene itself (Dat1, chromosome 13), but a powerful modulator of DAT expression in neostriatum. Furthermore, DAT expression levels in 20 of the BXD RI strains and the chromosome 19 QTL were correlated with cocaine and methamphetamine-induced locomotor activation and thermic responses (hypo- or hyperthermia), but were not correlated with behaviors related to sensitization, reward, voluntary consumption, stereotypy, or seizures induced by these two psychostimulant drugs. The results suggest that there is a gene(s) on proximal chromosome 19 that strongly influences DAT expression in neostriatum and may influence psychostimulant-induced activity and thermal responses.

To determine how heparin alters platelet function, we identified platelet-binding sites for heparin and measured heparin's influence on the function of platelet integrin alpha (IIb)beta (3) (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa). Methods: Photoaffinity cross-linking and affinity chromatography experiments were performed to identify platelet membrane proteins that bind heparin. Heparin's effect on fibrinogen binding to platelets was measured with a radioligand-binding assay. The translocation to the cytoskeleton of Rap2, a guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, was measured from platelets aggregating in response to heparin and other agonists. Results: Cross-linking and affinity chromatographic experiments positively identified the integrin alpha (IIb)beta (3) as a heparin-binding site. Heparin aggregation was calcium dependent. Low concentrations of unfractionated porcine mucosal heparin (2-5 U/mL) significantly increased fibrinogen I 125 binding to activated platelets, whereas higher doses did not. Heparin-mediated platelet aggregation was completely blocked by GRGDS peptide (5 mmol/L), a competitive inhibitor of fibrinogen binding, and was blocked by EDTA (2 mmol/L), which dissociates the functional integrin complex. Aggregation was associated with Rap2 translocation to the cytoskeleton, a sign of outside-in signaling. Conclusions Heparin binds to the alpha (IIb)beta (3) integrin in vitro and ex vivo, and heparin increases fibrinogen binding to the integrin. Heparin-mediated aggregation requires an intact integrin and ligand and leads to Rap2 translocation to the cytoskeleton-an outside-in signal of ligand engagement. Heparin may directly modulate platelet integrin function, most likely through direct binding and modulation of integrin function.

Receptor activation or inhibition thereof was assessed as [H-3]inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation. Quinazoline (alfuzosin, doxazosin, prazosin, terazosin) and non-quinazoline al-adrenoceptor antagonists (BE 2254, SE 216,469, tamsulosin) concentration-dependently inhibited phenylephrine-stimulated IP formation at both WT and CAM with K-i values similar to those previously found in radioligand binding studies. At CAM in the absence of phenylephrine, the quinazolines produced concentration-dependent inhibition of basal LP formation; the maximum inhibition was similar to 55%, and the corresponding EC50 values were slightly smaller than the K-i values. In contrast, BE 2254 produced much less inhibition of basal LP formation, SE 216,469 was close to being a neutral antagonist, and tamsulosin even weakly stimulated IP formation. The inhibitory effects of the quinazolines and BE 2254 as well as the stimulatory effect of tamsulosin were equally blocked by SE 216,469 at CAM. At WT in the absence of phenylephrine, tamsulosin did not cause significant stimulation and none of the other compounds caused significant inhibition of basal IP formation. We conclude that alpha (1)-adrenoceptor antagonsits with a quinazoline structure exhibit greater efficacy as inverse agonists than those without.

The binding of [C-11]raclopride, but not of [C-11]N-methylspiperone or [C-11]nemonapride with higher affinity, to the receptors was significantly decreased immediately after TIQ injection. Neither a dopamine transporter blocker induced such effect nor TIQ affected the dopamine transporter-radioligand binding. Among the compounds investigated, including parkinsonism-inducing TIQ and (R/S)-1-benzyl-TIQ, parkinsonism-preventing (R)- and (S)-1-methyl-TIQ, and probable N-methylated metabolites of TIQ and 1-methyl-TIQ, TIQ and (S)-1-methyl-TIQ had the strongest effect on the binding of [C-11]raclopride, and N-methylated derivatives showed less of an effect than the respective parent compounds. The decrease in the binding of [C-11]raclopride continued for 7 hours and was followed by an increase until 10 days after the single and subchronic administration of TIQ. These findings suggest that TIQ analogs profoundly stimulated dopamine release which resulted in the competitive inhibition of the binding of [C-11]raclopride to dopamine D-2 receptors, but did not induce degeneration of the receptors.

In voltage-clamp experiments low concentrations of physostigmine and tacrine potentiate ion currents induced by low concentrations of ACh, whereas at high concentrations they inhibit ACh-induced ion currents. These dual effects result in bell-shaped concentration-effect curves. Physostigmine and tacrine, by themselves, do not act as nicotinic receptor agonists. The larger potentiation is observed with 10 muM physostigmine on alpha4 beta4 nicotinic receptors and amounts to 70% at 1 muM ACh. The mechanism underlying the effects of physostigmine on alpha4 beta4 ACh receptors has been investigated in detail. Potentiation of ACh-induced ion current by low concentrations of physostigmine is surmounted at elevated concentrations of ACh, indicating that this is a competitive effect. Conversely, inhibition of ACh-induced ion current by high concentrations of physostigmine is not surmounted at high concentrations of ACh, and this effect appears mainly due to noncompetitive, voltage-dependent ion channel block. Radioligand binding experiments demonstrating displacement of the nicotinic receptor agonist I-125-epibatidine from its recognition sites on alpha4 beta4 ACI? receptors by physostigmine confirm that physostigmine is a competitive ligand at these receptors, A two-site equilibrium receptor occupation model, combined with noncompetitive ion channel block, accounts for the dual effects of physostigmine and tacrine on ACh-induced ion currents. It is concluded that these acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting drugs interact with the ACh recognition sites and are coagonists of ACh on alpha4-containing nicotinic ACh receptors.

It was found that atipamezole binds to platelet alpha(2)-adrenoceptors more effectively than yohimbine: [H-3]atipamezole has more than three times higher alpha(2)-adrenoceptor binding affinity in intact gel-filtered human platelets (equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) 0.7+/-0.21 vs. 2.9=/-0.77 nM, p<0.05), but only one-third of the binding capacity of [H-3]yohimbine (B-max 27.0+/-3.8 vs. 100+/-19 pM/ 10(5) cells, p<0.0l). Functionally, in comparison with yohimbine, an almost threefold lower concentration of atipamezole inhibited adrenaline (5 mu M)- induced platelet aggregation. A concentration of atipamezole, which inhibited this aggregation by 50% (IC50), was 0.37+/-0.07 mu M, whereas IC50 for yohimbine was 0.98+/-0.12 mu M, p<0.0001. Thus, atipamezole represents a functionally undisputed alpha(2)-adrenoceptor antagonist, more effective than yohimbine. Its distinct binding profile as a radioligand also suggests the presence of imidazol(in)e binding sites in platelets. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We examined serum autoantibodies to this liver-type enzyme in patients with hepatitis. Methods: Antibodies to recombinant human liver-type arginase were measured by ELISA in 95 patients and 55 healthy controls. Results: The mean absorbance values; in the ELISA assays of patients with definite autoimmune hepatitis (n = 11; P < 0.0001), probable autoimmune hepatitis (n = 31; P < 0.0001), and hepatitis C (HCV; n = 20; P < 0.01) were significantly different from those of healthy controls, but the values in patients with hepatitis B (HBV; n = 23) and other autoimmune diseases (n = 10) were not significantly different from those of healthy controls. When the cutoff was fixed at the upper 95th percentile of the absorbance value in healthy controls, positive reactions were found in 18.2%, 32.3%, 20.0%, 13.0%, and 10.0% of patients with definite autoimmune hepatitis, probable autoimmune hepatitis, HCV hepatitis, HBV hepatitis, and other autoimmune diseases, respectively. All of these positive reactions were abolished by inhibition of serum with recombinant antigen. The specificity and sensitivity of this ELISA were 96% and 29%, respectively. The intraassay and interassay coefficients of variation were 2.3-7.5% and 9.8-11%, respectively. There was no relationship between these antibodies and anti-nuclear, anti-smooth muscle, or anti-cytochrome P450IID6 antibodies; Conclusions: The ELISA for anti-liver-type arginase autoantibody improved the detectability of autoimmune hepatitis when compared with established assays for liver-specific autoantibodies (C) 2000 American Association far Clinical Chemistry.

However, 2 large trials of repeated albumin infusions demonstrated contrasting results between outpatients and hospitalized patients. We investigated markers of systemic inflammation, immune function, albumin binding, and cardiovascular function using samples from Albumin To prevenT Infection in chronic liveR failurE (ATTIRE) taken at baseline, day 5, and day 10 of the trial to identify why targeted albumin infusions had no effect in hospitalized patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were analyzed from 143 patients (n = 71 targeted albumin; n = 72 standard care at baseline) for cytokines, cardiovascular markers, prostaglandin E-2, the effect of plasma on macrophage function, and albumin radioligand binding and oxidation status. The sample size was based on our feasibility study, and samples were selected by a trial statistician stratified by the serum albumin level and the presence of infection at randomization and analyses performed blinded to the study arm. Data were linked to 3-month mortality and treatment groups compared. RESULTS: Increased baseline model for end-stage liver disease score, white cell count, calprotectin, CD163, tumor necrosis factor, renin, atrial natriuretic peptide, and syndecan-1 were associated with 3-month mortality. Despite infusing substantially differing volumes of albumin, there were no significant differences in inflammatory markers, albumin-prostaglandin E-2 binding, or cardiovascular markers between treatment arms. DISCUSSION: Contrary to many preclinical studies, targeted intravenous albumin therapy in hospitalized decompensated cirrhosis had no effect across a broad range of systemic inflammation, albumin function, and cardiovascular mediators and biomarkers compared with standard care, consistent with the null clinical findings.

We hypothesized that the IgA immunity is altered in individuals with type 1 diabetes. To test our hypothesis, we investigated intestinal, oral, and peripheral IgA immune responses in individuals with type 1 diabetes. Methods: We collected stool, oral cavity, and blood samples from participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (within 1 year and more than 1 year) and healthy control individuals. Serum islet autoantibody titers were detected by radioligand assays. IgA-bound bacteria and IgA-expressing B cells were studied by flow cytometry. Oral free IgA level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Serum and stool free IgA concentrations were determined by immune-turbidimetry method. Results: Individuals diagnosed with type 1 diabetes within 1 year had an increased proportion of stool IgA-bound bacteria compared with healthy control individuals.The proportion of stool IgA-bound bacteria was positively associated with glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibody titer. Moreover, individuals with a longer disease duration displayed a higher level of IgA-bound bacteria than those diagnosed within 1 year. In contrast to healthy control individuals, type 1 diabetes patients had increased serum IgA concentrations. Conclusions: Individuals with type 1 diabetes display altered IgA immunity, especially increased stool IgA-bound bacteria, which is likely to contribute to fi-cell autoimmunity and the disease development, and thus, might be considered as a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of type 1 diabetes.

Previously the benzo-alpha-pyrone based derivative, 3-phenyl-1H-2-benzopyran-1-one, was found to display both A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptor affinity in the low micromolar range. Prompted by this, the alpha-pyrone core was structurally modified to explore related benzoxazinone and quinazolinone homologues previously unknown as adenosine receptor antagonists. Overall, the C2-substituted quinazolinone analogues displayed superior A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptor affinity over their C2-substituted benzoxazinone homologues. The benzoxazinones were devoid of A(2A) adenosine receptor binding, with only two compounds displaying A(1) adenosine receptor affinity. In turn, the quinazolinones displayed varying degrees of affinity (low micromolar range) towards the A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptor subtypes. The highest A(1) adenosine receptor affinity and selectivity were favoured by methyl para-substitution of phenyl ring B (A(1)K(1) = 2.50 mu M). On the other hand, 3,4-dimethoxy substitution of phenyl ring B afforded the best A(2A) adenosine receptor binding (A(2A)K(1) = 2.81 mu M) among the quinazolinones investigated. In conclusion, the quinazolinones are ideal lead compounds for further structural optimization to gain improved adenosine receptor affinity, which may find therapeutic relevance in Parkinson's disease-associated cognitive deficits and motor dysfunctions as well as exerting neuroprotective properties.

In this study, we assessed in vivo pathological changes in mGluR1 availability in the Q175DN mouse model of HD using longitudinal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the radioligand [C-11]ITDM. Ninety-minute dynamic PET imaging scans were performed in 22 heterozygous (HET) Q175DN mice and 22 wild-type (WT) littermates longitudinally at 6, 12, and 16 months of age. Analyses of regional volume of distribution with an image-derived input function (V-T (IDIF)) and voxel-wise parametric V-T (IDIF) maps were performed to assess differences between genotypes. Post-mortem evaluation at 16 months was done to support in vivo findings. [C-11]ITDM V-T (IDIF) quantification revealed higher mGluR1 availability in the brain of HET mice compared to WT littermates (e.g. cerebellum: + 15.0%, + 17.9%, and + 17.6% at 6, 12, and 16 months, respectively; p < 0.001). In addition, an age-related decline in [C-11]ITDM binding independent of genotype was observed between 6 and 12 months. Voxel-wise analysis of parametric maps and post-mortem quantifications confirmed the elevated mGluR1 availability in HET mice compared to WT littermates. In conclusion, in vivo measurement of mGluR1 availability using longitudinal [C-11]ITDM PET imaging demonstrated higher [C-11]ITDM binding in extra-striatal brain regions during the course of disease in the Q175DN mouse model.

Translation of HDAC6 PET Imaging Using [<SUP>18</SUP>F]EKZ-001-cGMP Production and Measurement of HDAC6 Target Occupancy in Nonhuman Primates	ACS CHEMICAL NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Histone deacetylase 6; Central nervous system; Positron emission tomography; [F-18]EKZ-001; [F-18]Bavarostat; Current Good Manufacturing Practice	GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; ACETYLATION; INHIBITION; DISEASE	Histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is a multifunctional cytoplasmic enzyme involved in diverse cellular processes such as intracellular transport and protein quality control. Inhibition of HDAC6 can alleviate defects in cell and rodent models of certain diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, while HDAC6 represents a potentially powerful therapeutic target, development of effective brain-penetrant HDAC6 inhibitors remains challenging. Recently, [F-18]EKZ-001 ([F-18] Bavarostat), a brain-penetrant positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand with high affinity and selectivity toward HDAC6, was developed and evaluated preclinically for its ability to bind HDAC6. Herein, we describe the efficient and robust fully automated current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) compliant production method. [F-18]EKZ-001 quantification methods were validated in nonhuman primates (NHP) using full kinetic modeling, and [F-18]EKZ-001 PET was applied to compare dose-occupancy relationships between two HDAC6 inhibitors, EKZ-317 and ACY-775. [F-18]EKZ-001 is cGMP produced with an average decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 14% and an average molar activity of 204 GBq/mu mol. We demonstrate that a two-tissue compartmental model and Logan graphical analysis are appropriate for [F-18]EKZ-001 PET quantification in NHP brain. Blocking studies show that the novel compound EKZ-317 achieves higher target occupancy than ACY-775. This work supports the translation of [F-18]EKZ-001 PET for first-in-human studies.

However, immune-related adverse events are common including autoimmune responses against different endocrine organs. Here, a case of ICI-mediated hypoparathyroidism focusing on long-term follow-up and insights into its etiology is presented. Case and methods A 73-year-old man developed severe symptomatic hypocalcemia after the initiation of ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Hypoparathyroidism was diagnosed with undetectable intact parathyroid hormone (PTH). Immunoprecipitation assays, ELISAs, and cell-based functional assays were used to test the patient for antibodies against the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). NACHT leucine-rich repeat protein 5 (NALP5) and cytokine antibodies were measured in radioligand binding assays and ELISAs, respectively. Results The patient's symptoms improved with aggressive calcium and vitamin D supplementation. At 3 years and 3 months since the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism, PTH was still inappropriately low at 7.6 pg/mL, and attempted discontinuation of calcium and calcitriol resulted in recurrent symptomatic hypocalcemia. Analysis for an autoimmune etiology of the patient's hypoparathyroidism indicated that CaSR antibodies were negative before treatment and detected at multiple time points afterwards, and corresponded to the patient's clinical course of hypoparathyroidism. CaSR antibodies purified from the patient's serum activated the human CaSR. The patient was seronegative for NALP5 and cytokine antibodies, indicating that their hypoparathyroidism was not a manifestation of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type 1. Conclusion The etiology of hypocalcemia is likely autoimmune hypoparathyroidism caused by the development of CaSR-activating antibodies that might prevent PTH release from the parathyroid.

Glutamic acid decarboxylase antibody (GADA), insulinoma antigen 2 antibody (IA-2A), zinc transporter 8 antibody (ZnT8A) and tetraspanin7 antibody (TSPAN7A) were assayed by radioligand or luciferase immunoprecipitation system assays in 205 newly diagnosed acute-onset T1DM patients and 170 healthy controls. Other organ-specific autoantibodies, including thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOA), thyroglobulin antibody (TGA), tissue transglutaminase antibody (tTGA) and 21-hydroxylase antibody (21-OHA), were also measured. The prevalence of GADA, IA-2A, ZnT8A, TSPAN7A, TPOA, TGA and 21-OHA was higher in T1DM patients than in healthy controls. The combinational assay of various islet autoantibodies could increase the frequency of autoantibody positivity in T1DM to 85.4%. GADA+ IA-2A+ T1DM patients preferentially had TPOA and TGA, while IA-2A+ patients often had tTGA. Patients positive for two or more islet autoantibodies often had TPOA and TGA. BMI of multiple islet autoantibody-positive patients was lower than that of patients with single or no islet autoantibodies, and there were no significant differences in C-peptide and glycated hemoglobin between patients positive for islet autoantibodies combined with other organ-specific antibodies and noncombined patients. Younger female patients who were islet autoantibody positive were more likely to have TPOA and TGA. The frequency of Graves' disease was much higher in T1DM patients than in healthy controls. T1DM usually occurs together with other organ-specific autoantibodies. Measuring of other organ-specific autoantibodies will be beneficial for T1DM patients.

Reliable biomarkers for in vivo activity on the GCGR, in the setting of dual glucagon-like peptide 1/glucagon (GLP-1/GCG) receptor agonism, are currently unavailable. Here, we investigated [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG as a biomarker for GCGR occupancy in liver, the tissue with highest GCGR expression, in non-human primates (NHP) by PET. [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG was evaluated by dynamic PET in NHPs by a dose escalation study design, where up to 67 mu g/kg DO3A-S01-GCG peptide mass was co-injected. The test-retest reproducibility of [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG binding in liver was evaluated. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of pre-treatment with acylated glucagon agonist 1-GCG on [Ga-68]GaDO3A-S01-GCG binding in liver. [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG bound to liver in vivo in a dose-dependent manner. Negligible peptide mass effect was observed for DO3A-S01-GCG doses <0.2 mu g/kg. In vivo K-d for [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG corresponded to 0.7 mu g/kg, which indicates high potency. The test-retest reproducibility for [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG binding in liver was 5.7 +/- 7.9%. Pre-treatment with 1-GCG, an acylated glucagon agonist, resulted in a GCGR occupancy of 61.5 +/- 9.1% in liver. Predicted human radiation dosimetry would allow for repeated annual [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG PET examinations. In summary, PET radioligand [Ga-68]Ga-DO3A-S01-GCG is a quantitative biomarker of in vivo GCGR occupancy.

The combination of structural elements (heterocyclic nucleus, alkyl chain and 4-substituted piperazine), known to play critical roles in affinity for serotoninergic receptors, and the proper selection of substituents led to compounds with high specificity and affinity towards serotoninergic receptors. In binding studies, several molecules showed high affinity in nanomolar and subnanomolar range at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and moderate or no affinity for other relevant receptors (D-1, D-2, alpha(1) and alpha(2)). N-(2-(4-(pyrimidin-2-yl) piperazin-1-yl) ethyl) picolinamide (3o) with Ki = 0.046 nM, was the most affine and selective derivative for the 5-HT1A receptor compared to other serotoninergic dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors. N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazin-1-yl) ethyl) picolinamide (3b), instead, showed a subnanomolar affinity towards 5-HT2A with Ki = 0.0224 nM, whereas N-(2-(4-(bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl) picolinamide (3s) presented an attractive 5-HT2C affinity with K-i = 0.8 nM. Moreover, the compounds having better affinity and selectivity binding profiles towards 5-HT2A were selected and tested on rat ileum, to determine their effect on 5HT induced contractions. Those more selective towards 5-HT1A receptors were studied in vivo on several behavioral tests. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Quantification of highly selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist CM304 using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and its application to a pre-clinical pharmacokinetic study	DRUG TESTING AND ANALYSIS			English	Article						CM304; UPLC-MS/MS; bioanalysis; cocaine addiction	BINDING-SITES; LIGANDS; CLONING; PET; LOCALIZATION; RADIOLIGAND; EXPRESSION; DISEASE; ANALOGS; BRAIN	An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for quantification of CM304, a novel and highly selective sigma-1 receptor antagonist that has recently entered into human clinical trials. A structural analogue of CM304, SN56, was used as the internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Acquity UPLC (TM) BEH C18 (1.7 mu m, 2.1 mm x 50 mm) column using a mobile phase [water: methanol (0.1% v/v formic acid; 50: 50, %v/v)] at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min. Mass spectrometric detection was performed in the positive ionization mode with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using m/z transitions of 337 > 238 for CM304 and 319 > 220 for the IS. The method was found to be linear and reproducible with a regression coefficient consistently >0.99 for the calibration range of 3 to 3000 ng/mL. The extraction recovery ranged from 91.5 to 98.4% from spiked (7.5, 300 and 2526 ng/mL) plasma quality control samples. The precision (%RSD; 1.1 to 2.9%) and accuracy (% RE; - 1.9 to 1.8%) were within acceptable limit. The validated method was successfully applied to a single dose oral and intravenous (I.V.) pharmacokinetic study of CM304 in rats. Following I.V. administration, the compound exhibited adequate exposure along with high extravascular distribution and insignificant amount of extra hepatic metabolism.

Here we describe 3-(3,4-difluoropheny1)-N-(1-(6-(4-(pyriclin-2-y1)piperazin-1-y1)pyrazin-2-371)ethyl)propanamide (B-973), a novel piperazine-containing molecule that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the a7 receptor. We characterize the action of B-973 on the a7 receptor using electrophysiology and radioligand binding. At 0.1 mM acetylcholine, 1 mu M B-973 potentiated peak acetylcholine-induced currents 6 -fold relative to maximal acetylcholine (3 mM) and slowed channel desensitization, resulting in a 6900 -fold increase in charge transfer. The EC50 of B-973 was approximately 0.3 mu M at acetylcholine concentrations ranging from 0.03 to 3 mM. At a concentration of 1 mu M, B-973 shifted the acetylcholine BC50 of peak currents from 0.30 mM in control to 0.007 mM. B-973 slowed channel deactivation upon acetylcholine removal (tau=50 s) and increased the affinity of the alpha 7 agonist [H-3]A-585539. In the absence of exogenously added acetylcholine, application of B-973 at concentrations > 1 1 mu M induced large methyllycaconitine-sensitive currents, suggesting B-973 can function as an Ago-PAM at high concentrations. B-973 will be a useful probe for investigating the biological consequences of increasing alpha 7 receptor activity through allosteric modulation.

We combined alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the A1AR second extracellular loop (ECL2) with radioligand binding and functional interaction assays to quantify effects on allosteric ligand affinity, cooperativity, and efficacy. Docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using an A1AR homology model based on an agonist-bound A2AAR structure. Substitution of E172ECL2 for alanine reduced the affinity of the allosteric modulators PD81723 and VCP171 for the unoccupied A1AR. Residues involved in cooperativity with the orthosteric agonist NECA were different in PD81723 and VCP171; positive cooperativity between PD81723 and NECA was reduced on alanine substitution of a number of ECL2 residues, including E170ECL2 and K173ECL2, whereas mutation of W146ECL2 and W156ECL2 decreased VCP171 cooperativity with NECA. Molecular modeling localized a likely allosteric pocket for both modulators to an extracellular vestibule that overlaps with a region used by orthosteric ligands as they transit into the canonical A(1)AR orthosteric site. MD simulations confirmed a key interaction between E172ECL2 and both modulators. Bound PD81723 is flanked by another residue, E170ECL2, which forms hydrogen bonds with adjacent K168ECL2 and K173ECL2. Collectively, our data suggest E172ECL2 is a key allosteric ligand-binding determinant, whereas hydrogen-bonding networks within the extracellular vestibule may facilitate the transmission of cooperativity between orthosteric and allosteric sites.

Here, we investigated the underlying mechanism that may account for the reproductive dysfunction induced by simazine. We found that following maternal exposure, simazine is transmitted to the offspring, as evidenced by its presence in the offspring ovaries. Analyses of the simazine-exposed offspring revealed that the expression of the relaxin hormone receptor, relaxin-family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), prominently decreased in their ovaries and uteri. In addition, downstream target genes of the relaxin pathway including nitric oxide (NO) synthase 2 (Nos2), Nos3, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (Mmp9), and vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) were downregulated in their ovaries. Moreover, AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERR) levels and their phosphorylated active forms decreased in simazine-exposed ovaries. In vitro exposure of the human ovarian granulosa cells (KGN) and uterine endometrium cells (Hec-1A) to very low concentrations (0.001 to 1 nM) of triazines including atrazine, terbuthylazine, and propazine repressed NO production with a concurrent reduction in RXFP1, NOS2, and NOS3. The inhibitory action of triazines on NO release was dependent on RXFP1, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT, and ERR. Radioligand-binding assay also confirmed that triazines competitively inhibited the binding of relaxin to its receptor. Therefore, the present study suggests that triazine herbicides act as endocrine disrupters by interfering with relaxin hormone signaling. Thus, further evaluation of their impact on human health is imperative. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

MLi-2, a Potent, Selective, and Centrally Active Compound for Exploring the Therapeutic Potential and Safety of LRRK2 Kinase Inhibitions	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							AUTOSOMAL-DOMINANT PARKINSONISM; BRAIN PENETRANT; HIGHLY POTENT; DISEASE; MUTATIONS; GENE; DISCOVERY	Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common genetic cause of familial and sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). That the most prevalent mutation, G2019S, leads to increased kinase activity has led to a concerted effort to identify LRRK2 kinase inhibitors as a potential disease-modifying therapy for PD. An internal medicinal chemistry effort identified several potent and highly selective compounds with favorable drug-like properties. Here, we characterize the pharmacological properties of cis-2,6-dimethyl-4-(6-(5-(1-methylcyclopropoxy)-1H-indazol-3-yl) pyrimidin-4-yl) morpholine (MLi-2), a structurally novel, highly potent, and selective LRRK2 kinase inhibitor with central nervous system activity. MLi-2 exhibits exceptional potency in a purified LRRK2 kinase assay in vitro (IC50 = 0.76 nM), a cellular assay monitoring dephosphorylation of LRRK2 pSer935 LRRK2 (IC50 = 1.4 nM), and a radioligand competition binding assay (IC50 = 3.4 nM). MLi-2 has greater than 295-fold selectivity for over 300 kinases in addition to a diverse panel of receptors and ion channels. Acute oral and subchronic dosing in MLi-2 mice resulted in dosedependent central and peripheral target inhibition over a 24-hour period as measured by dephosphorylation of pSer935 LRRK2. Treatment of MitoPark mice with MLi-2 was well tolerated over a 15-week period at brain and plasma exposures >100 x the in vivo plasma IC50 for LRRK2 kinase inhibition as measured by pSer935 dephosphorylation. Morphologic changes in the lung, consistent with enlarged type II pneumocytes, were observed in MLi-2-treated MitoPark mice. These data demonstrate the suitability of MLi-2 as a compound to explore LRRK2 biology in cellular and animal models.

This study documents the fungal diversity associated with 39 species of sponges and determines their potential to produce secondary metabolites capable of interacting with mammalian G-protein-coupled receptors involved in blood pressure regulation. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 563 representative fungal strains obtained from marine sponges collected by SCUBA from the Caribbean and the Pacific regions of Panama. A total of 194 operational taxonomic units were found with 58 % represented by singletons based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial large subunit (LSU) rDNA regions. Marine sponges were highly dominated by Ascomycota fungi (95.6 %) and represented by two major classes, Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes. Rarefaction curves showed no saturation, indicating that further efforts are needed to reveal the entire diversity at this site. Several unique clades were found during phylogenetic analysis with the highest diversity of unique clades in the order Pleosporales. From the 65 cultures tested to determine their in vitro effect on angiotensin and endothelin receptors, the extracts of Fusarium sp. and Phoma sp. blocked the activation of these receptors by more than 50 % of the control and seven others inhibited between 30 and 45 %. Our results indicate that marine sponges from Panama are a "hot spot" of fungal diversity as well as a rich resource for capturing, cataloguing, and assessing the pharmacological potential of substances present in previously undiscovered fungi associated with marine sponges.

A nicotinic receptor-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of the flavonoid rhamnetin in BV2 microglia	FITOTERAPIA			English	Article						Solidago nemoralis; Flavonoids; Drug discovery; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; Neuroinflammation	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; INFLAMMATORY MEDIATORS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; IDENTIFICATION; MECHANISMS; BINDING; METHYLLYCACONITINE; NEUROINFLAMMATION; POLYPHENOLS	The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a potential target in neuroinflammation. Screening a plant extract library identified Solidago nemoralis as containing methyl-quercetin derivatives that are relatively selective ligands for the alpha7 nAChR. Flavonoids are not known for this activity, so we screened a small library of pure flavonoids to confirm our findings. Some flavonoids, e.g. rhamnetin, displaced a selective alpha7 nAChR radioligand from rat brain membranes whereas similar structures e.g. sakuranetin, did not. To evaluate the contribution of this putative nAChR activity to the known anti-inflammatory properties of these flavonoids, we compared their effects on lipopolysaccharide induced release of inflammatory mediators from BV2 microglia. Both rhamnetin and sakuranetin reduced mediator release, but differed in potency (rhamnetin > sakuranetin) and the Hill slope of their concentration-response curves. For rhamnetin the Hill coefficient was >3.0 whereas for sakuranetin the coefficient was 1.0, suggesting that effects of rhamnetin are mediated through more than one mechanism, whereas sakuranetin has a single mechanism. nAChR antagonists decreased the Hill coefficient for rhamnetin toward unity, which suggests that a nAChR-mediated mechanism contributes cooperatively to its overall anti-inflammatory effect. In contrast nAChR antagonists had no effect on the potency or Hill coefficient for sakuranetin, but a concentration of nicotine (1 mu M) that had no effect alone, significantly increased the Hill coefficient of this flavonoid. In conclusion, the anti-inflammatory effects of rhamnetin benefit cooperatively from a nAChR-mediated mechanism. This action, together with potent free radical scavenging activity, suggests that flavonoids with alpha7 nAChR activity have therapeutic potential in neuroinflammatory conditions.

Optimization of Multimodal Imaging of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Using the Human Sodium Iodide Symporter for PET and Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging	PLOS ONE			English	Article							VERSUS-HOST-DISEASE; HUMAN HEMATOPOIETIC-CELLS; LENTIVIRAL VECTORS; GENE-THERAPY; EXPRESSION; PROMOTER; DIFFERENTIATION; TRANSPLANTATION; RESISTANT; VIVO	Purpose: The use of stably integrated reporter gene imaging provides a manner to monitor the in vivo fate of engrafted cells over time in a non-invasive manner. Here, we optimized multimodal imaging (small-animal PET, Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) and bioluminescence imaging (BLI)) of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), by means of the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) and firefly luciferase (Fluc) as reporters. Methods: First, two multicistronic lentiviral vectors (LV) were generated for multimodal imaging: BLI, I-124 PET/SPECT and CLI. Expression of the imaging reporter genes was validated in vitro using (TcO4-)-Tc-99m radioligand uptake experiments and BLI. Uptake kinetics, specificity and tracer elution were determined as well as the effect of the transduction process on the cell's differentiation capacity. MSCs expressing the LV were injected intravenously or subcutaneously and imaged using small-animal PET, CLI and BLI. Results: The expression of both imaging reporter genes was functional and specific. An elution of (TcO4-)-Tc-99m from the cells was observed, with 31% retention after 3 h. After labeling cells with I-124 in vitro, a significantly higher CLI signal was noted in hNIS expressing murine MSCs. Furthermore, it was possible to visualize cells injected intravenously using BLI or subcutaneously in mice, using I-124 small-animal PET, CLI and BLI. Conclusions: This study identifies hNIS as a suitable reporter gene for molecular imaging with PET and CLI, as confirmed with BLI through the expression of Fluc. It supports the potential for a wider application of hNIS reporter gene imaging and future clinical applications.

In this paper, we have reported the synthesis of a novel derivative of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl) piperazine that is labeled with Tc-99m (CO)(3) via click chemistry. Methods: The bidentate alkyne, propargylglycine was reacted with phenyl piperazine triazole derivative in the presence of a catalytic amount of Cu (I) to form tridentate ligand. The ligand was radiolabeled with the precursor [Tc-99m] [(H2O)(3) (CO)(3)](+) and characterized by HPLC. The bioevaluation of radio labeled ligand was carried out in rats. Results: Triazole complex was labeled by Tc-99m-tricarbonyl and its radiochemical yield was more than >95% which was determined by HPLC. In vivo stability studies in human serum albumin show a 93% ratio of complex after a 24 h period. The calculated partition coefficient (logP) was 0.34+/-0.02. Receptor binding assays indicated about 70% specific binding of radioligand to 5-HT1A receptors. Biodistribution studies have shown brain hippocampus uptake of 0.40+/-0.08 %ID/g at 30 min post injection. Conclusions: Results indicate that this Tc-99m-tricabonyl-arylpiperazine derivative has specific binding to 5-HT1A receptors and presented suitable characters for its use as a CNS imaging agent.

Previous studies have provided data both in favor and against a cell membrane carrier-mediated transport of endocannabinoids, using different methodological approaches. Because AEA and 2-AG undergo rapid and almost complete intracellular hydrolysis, we employed a combination of radioligand assays and absolute quantification of cellular and extracellular endocannabinoid levels. In human U937 leukemia cells, 100 nM AEA and 1 mu M 2-AG were taken up through a fast and saturable process, reaching a plateau after 5 min. Employing differential pharmacological blockage of endocannabinoid uptake, breakdown, and interaction with intracellular binding proteins, we show that eicosanoid endocannabinoids harboring an arachidonoyl chain compete for a common membrane target that regulates their transport, whereas other N-acylethanolamines did not interfere with AEA and 2-AG uptake. By combining fatty acid amide hydrolase or monoacyl glycerol lipase inhibitors with hydrolase-inactive concentrations of the AEA transport inhibitors UCM707 (1 mu M) and OMDM-2 (5 mu M), a functional synergism on cellular AEA and 2-AG uptake was observed. Intriguingly, structurally unrelated AEA uptake inhibitors also blocked the cellular release of AEA and 2-AG. We show, for the first time, that UCM707 and OMDM-2 inhibit the bidirectional movement of AEA and 2-AG across cell membranes. Our findings suggest that a putative endocannabinoid cell membrane transporter controls the cellular AEA and 2-AG trafficking and metabolism.

Ser352 and Ser354 in the carboxyl terminus of the human P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor are required for agonist-promoted phosphorylation and internalization in MDCK cells	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						P2Y(1) receptor; agonist-promoted internalization; agonist-promoted phosphorylation; MDCK cells; MRS2500; protein kinase C; radioligand binding	DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION; NUCLEOTIDE RECEPTORS; PLATELET-AGGREGATION; DOWN-REGULATION; DESENSITIZATION; ADP; ENDOCYTOSIS; ACTIVATION; MECHANISMS; ANTAGONIST	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The P2Y(1) receptor promotes chloride secretion in epithelial cells, a process critical for regulation of extracellular ion and fluid levels. Here we have examined the role of phosphorylation in agonist-induced internalization of P2Y(1) receptors. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH A high-affinity radiolabelled antagonist, MRS2500, was used to quantify cell surface-binding sites of P2Y(1) receptors in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells, following exposure to agonists. The regions in the carboxyl terminus involved in both agonist-induced internalization of the receptor and its phosphorylation were identified by mutational analysis. KEY RESULTS Endogenous and stably expressed recombinant P2Y(1) receptors rapidly internalized with similar time courses in response to agonist in MDCK cells, ensuring that the levels of recombinant receptor achieved by retroviral infection did not adversely affect function of the internalization machinery. Four protein kinase C inhibitors of varying specificity did not affect internalization of recombinant receptors. Agonist-promoted internalization of a series of truncated P2Y(1) receptors identified a region between residues 349 and 359 in the carboxyl terminus as critical for regulation. Two amino acids within this region, Ser352 and Ser354, were shown to be both necessary and sufficient for agonist-promoted receptor phosphorylation and internalization. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Our results firmly establish Ser352 and Ser354 in the carboxyl terminus of P2Y(1) receptors as critical residues for agonist-induced receptor internalization in MDCK cells. As the mechanism mediating this regulation requires phosphorylation of these key residues, the relevant receptor-regulated protein kinase can now be identified.

The synthesis of novel compound 8-(furan-2-yl)-3-benzyl thiazolo[5,4-e][1,2,4] triazolo [1,5-c] pyrimidine-2-(3H)-thione (BTTP) was carried out to evaluate the potential of BTTP as A(2A)R antagonist using SCH58261, a standard A(2A)R antagonist. The strong interaction of BTTP with A(2A)R (Delta G=-12.46 kcal/mol and K-i=0.6 nM) in silico analysis was confirmed by radioligand receptor binding studies showing high affinity (K-i=0.004 nM) and selectivity with A(2A)R (A(2A)/A(1)=1155-fold). The effect of CGS21680 (selective A(2A)R agonist) induced cAMP concentration (0.1 pmol/ml) in HEK293 cells was antagonized with BTTP (0.065 pmol/ml) and SCH58261 (0.075 pmol/ml). Furthermore. BTTP pre-treated (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg) haloperidol-induced mice demonstrated significant attenuation in catalepsy and akinesia. BTTP induced elevation in the striatal dopamine concentration (2.90 mu M/mg of tissue) was comparable to SCH58261 (2.92 mu M/mg of tissue) at the dose of 10 mg/kg. The results firmly articulate that BTTP possesses potential A(2A)R antagonist activity and can be further explored for the treatment of PD. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

During isometric tension measurements in thoracic aortic rings from Wistar rats, we observed that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP selectively induced a rightward shift of the concentration response curve for the thromboxane mimetic U46619, without altering the contractile response to noradrenaline. We hypothesised that 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP and similar compounds may function as direct thromboxane receptor antagonists. Indeed, in addition to 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP, also 8-pCPT-cAMP, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine-3',5'-cyclic monophosphorothioate, Rp-isomer (Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS) and 8-CPT-adenosine, but not 8-Bromo-2'-O-Me-cAMP, induced rightward shifts of the contractile response to U46619. Likewise, 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS, but not 8-Bromo-2'-O-Me-cAMP, specifically reduced U46619-induced aggregation of human platelets. In addition, 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP and Rp-8-CPT-cAMPS completely reversed U46619-induced reduction of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression and migration of human coronary artery endothelial cells. Most important, the cAMP analogs that reduced the contractile response to U46619 also concentration-dependently inhibited binding of the thromboxane receptor radioligand [5,6-F-3]SQ29548 to human platelets. We conclude that 8-pCPT-conjugated cAMP analogs exert competitive thromboxane receptor antagonistic properties.

During Alzheimer's disease (AD), these cholinergic neurons degenerate, therefore selectively activating M-1 receptors could improve cognitive function in these patients while avoiding unwanted peripheral responses associated with non-selective muscarinic agonists. We describe here benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid (BQCA), a highly selective allosteric potentiator of the M-1 mAChR. BQCA reduces the concentration of ACh required to activate M-1 up to 129-fold with an inflection point value of 845 nM. No potentiation, agonism, or antagonism activity on other mAChRs is observed up to 100 mu M. Furthermore studies in M-1(-/-) mice demonstrates that BQCA requires M-1 to promote inositol phosphate turnover in primary neurons and to increase c-fos and arc RNA expression and ERK phosphorylation in the brain. Radioligand-binding assays, molecular modeling, and site-directed mutagenesis experiments indicate that BQCA acts at an allosteric site involving residues Y179 and W400. BQCA reverses scopolamine-induced memory deficits in contextual fear conditioning, increases blood flow to the cerebral cortex, and increases wakefulness while reducing delta sleep. In contrast to M-1 allosteric agonists, which do not improve memory in scopolamine-challenged mice in contextual fear conditioning, BQCA induces beta-arrestin recruitment to M-1, suggesting a role for this signal transduction mechanism in the cholinergic modulation of memory. In summary, BQCA exploits an allosteric potentiation mechanism to provide selectivity for the M-1 receptor and represents a promising therapeutic strategy for cognitive disorders.

Among these ligands, we discovered that 7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-{3-(4-methylaminobenzyl) phenyl}-2-(1H)-quinolone (12) and 5-ethyl-7-chloro-4-hydroxy-3-(3-methylaminophenyl)-2(1H)-quinolone (32) have high affinity for the glycine site (K-i values; 11.7 nM for 12 and 11.8 nM for 32). In vitro autoradiography experiments indicated that [C-11]12 and [C-11]32 showed high specific binding in the brain slices, which were strongly inhibited by both glycine agonists and antagonists. In vivo brain uptake of these C-11-labeled 4HQs were examined in normal mice. Cerebellum to blood ratio of accumulation, of both [C-11]12 and [C-11]32 at 30 min were 0.058, which were slightly higher than those of cerebrum to blood ratio (0.043 and 0.042, respectively). These results indicated that [C-11]12 and [C-11]32 have poor blood brain barrier permeability. Although the plasma protein-binding ratio of [C-11]32 was much lower than methoxy analogs (71% vs 94-98%, respectively), [C-11]32 still binds with plasma protein strongly. It is conjectured that still acidic moiety and high affinity with plasma protein of [C-11]32 may prevent in vivo brain uptake. In conclusion, [C-11]12 and [C-11]32 are unsuitable for imaging cerebral NMDA receptors. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

MDMA self-administration in rats: acquisition, progressive ratio responding and serotonin transporter binding	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						drug reinforcement; MDMA abuse; neuroadaptation	NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS SHELL; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE MDMA; RHESUS-MONKEYS; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; (+/-)-3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE MDMA; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; UPTAKE SITES; MOUSE-BRAIN; COCAINE; ECSTASY	3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) self-administration has been shown in animals with extensive drug histories, but only a small number of studies have examined high rates of responding maintained by MDMA in previously drug-naive animals. In the present study, influence of dose (0.25 or 1.0 mg/kg/infusion) on the acquisition of MDMA self-administration was measured during daily 6-h sessions. Dose-effect data were obtained for MDMA (0.25-1.0 mg/kg/infusion) self-administration under a progressive ratio (PR) schedule of reinforcement. The effect of experimenter- or self-administered MDMA on [(3)H] paroxetine binding in several brain regions was measured. Acquisition of MDMA self-administration was highly variable and not different for 0.25 or 1.0 mg/kg/infusion progressed with approximately 60% of the rats acquiring reliable self-administration during the 15-day test period. The percentage of rats that acquired MDMA self-administration was lower than the percentage of rats that acquired cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/infusion) self-administration, and cocaine self-administration was acquired with a shorter latency. Responding maintained by MDMA was dose dependent, and breakpoints under a PR schedule increased with dose. Radioligand binding and autoradiography demonstrated lower densities of serotonin transporter sites (SERT) in MDMA self-administering rats as compared with controls across brain regions. The reduction in SERT densities was comparable in magnitude to rats treated with experimenter-administered doses of MDMA. These data support the idea that MDMA is a drug with high abuse liability, and long-term self-administration may lead to long-lasting deficits in serotonin neurotransmission.

By semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the mRNA of the IGF-IR could be detected in all samples of normal adrenomedullary cells (n= 13) and pheochromocytomas (n= 16). However, pheochromocytomas exhibited 2 center dot 8-fold higher mean IGF-IR mRNA levels than normal adrenomedullary cells (2-8 +/- 0-5x10(5) molecules/mu g RNA vs 7-8 +/- 1-2x10(5) molecules/mu g RNA; P < 0-001). This overexpression of the IGF-IR in pheochromocytomas could be confirmed at the protein level by binding studies. Radioligand assays and Scatchard analysis revealed a single class of high affinity IGF-IR binding sites with a similar dissociation constant (K-d: 0.32 +/- 0.1 nmol/l vs 0.22 +/- 0.08 nmol/l) for both normal adrenomedullary cells and pheochromocytomas. However, specific (125)l-labeled lGF-I binding and the calculated receptor concentration were significantly elevated in pheochromocytomas as compared with normal adrenomedullary cells (58.3 +/- 5 vs 24-3 +/- 12 nmol/kg protein; P < 0-05). In summary, our results demonstrate significant overexpression of the IGF-IR in human pheochromocytomas. This suggests a possible role of the IGF system in the pathogenesis of adrenal neoplasia and thus IGF-IR may be a target for future therapeutic approaches.

The selective 5-HT1AR radioligand [18F]trans-4-fluoro-N-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethyl]-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide (FCWAY) permits in vivo assessment of central 5-HT1AR binding using positron emission tomography (PET). We studied 16 unmedicated symptomatic outpatients with PD and 15 matched healthy controls. Seven patients had an additional diagnosis of a current major depressive episode, however PD was the primary diagnosis. A 120 min PET study of 5-HT1AR binding was acquired using a GE Advance scanner in three-dimensional mode. Using quantitative PET image analysis, regional values were obtained for[18F]-FCWAY volume of distribution (DV), corrected for plasma protein binding, and K1, the delivery rate of [18F]-FCWAY from plasma to tissue. MRI scanning was performed using a GE Signa Scanner (3.0 Tesla) to provide an anatomical framework for image analysis and partial volume correction of PET data. PD patients showed lower DV in the anterior cingulate (t = 4.3; p < 0.001), posterior cingulate (t = 4.1; p < 0.001), and raphe (t = 3.1; p = 0.004). Comparing patients with PD, patients with PD and comorbid depression, and healthy controls revealed that DVs did not differ between PD patients and PD patients with comorbid depression, whereas both patient groups differed significantly from controls. These results provide for the first time in vivo evidence for the involvement of 5-HT(1A)Rs in the pathophysiology of PD.

To study the pharmacological properties of the third extracellular loop an antibody was raised in rabbits against the sequence 304-316 which is unique to MOR-1 and includes the third external loop; the anti-MOR-1 antibody was affinity purified against the imummogen sequence and characterized by [3 H]DAMGO and Western blotting; [3 H]DPDPE binding assay remained unchanged in the presence of the antibody. Anti-MOR-1 IgG was characterized as a neutral antagonist in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells hyperexpressing constitutively active MOR-1s; in fact, anti-MOR-1 IgG completely reversed the inhibition induced by the MOR-1 agonist endomorphin 1, endomorphin2, DAMGO and morphine on forskolin stimulated cyclic AMP (cAMP) accumulation and attenuated both the action of the selective MOR-1 agonist DAMGO to increase [S-35]GTPgammaS binding and the action of the MOR-1 inverse agonist beta-chlomaltrexamine (CNA) to decrease [S-35]GTPgammaS binding. Radioligand binding assay using membrane suspensions from CHO cells hyperexpressing MOR-1 revealed a significant decreased binding affinity and capacity of all the tested MORA selective ligands after preincubation with anti-MOR-1 IgG. Therefore, the third extracellular loop of MOR- I appeared to be a key element for the binding of MOR-1 ligands. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We focused on immunological abnormalities against neurotransmitter receptors in CFS. Using a sensitive radioligand assay, we examined serum autoantibodies to recombinant human muscarinic cholinergic receptor 1 (CHRM1), mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1), 5-hydroxytryptarnine receptor 1A (HTR1A), and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) in patients with CFS (n=60) and results were compared with those in patients with autoimmune disease (n=33) and in healthy controls (n=30). The mean anti-CHRM1 antibody index was significantly higher in patients with CFS (p<0.0001) and autoimmune disease (p<0.05) than that in healthy controls, and positive reaction was found in 53.3% of patients with CFS. Anti-OPRM1 antibodies, anti-HTR1A antibodies, and anti-DRD2 antibodies were found in 15.2, 1.7, and 5.0% of patients with CFS, respectively. Anti-nuclear antibodies were found in 56.7% (34/60) of patients with CFS, but anti-nuclear antibody titers did not correlate with the activities of the above four autoantibodies. The patients with positive autoantibodies to CHRM1 had a significantly higher mean score (1.81) of 'feeling of muscle weakness' than negative patients (1.18) among CFS patients (p<0.01). Higher scores on 'painful node', 'forgetfulness', and 'difficulty thinking' were also found in CFS patients with anti-CHRM1 antibodies but did not reach statistical significance. In conclusion, autoantibodies to CHRM1 were detected in a large number of CFS patients and were related to CFS symptoms. Our findings suggested that subgroups of CFS are associated with autoimmune abnormalities of CHRM1.

The purpose of the present study is to further elucidate the subtype selectivity of [F-18]FP-TZTP using genetically engineered mice which lacked functional M1, M2, M3, or M4 muscarinic receptors. Using ex vivo autoradiography, the regional brain localization of [F-18]FP-TZTP in M2 knockout (M2 KO) was significantly decreased (51.3 to 61.4%; P<0.01) when compared to the wild-type (WT) mice in amygdala, brain stem, caudate putamen, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, and thalamus. In similar studies with M1KO, M3KO and M4KO compared to their WT mice, [F-18]FP-TZTP uptakes in the same brain regions were not significantly decreased at P<0.01. However, in amygdala and hippocampus small decreases of 19.5% and 22.7%, respectively, were observed for M1KO vs WT. mice at P<0.05. Given the fact that large decreases in [F-18]FP-TZTP brain uptakes were seen only in M2 KO vs. WT mice, we conclude that [F-18]FP-TZTP preferentially labels M2 receptors in vivo.

J	Harkness, PC; Millar, NS				Harkness, PC; Millar, NS			Changes in conformation and subcellular distribution of α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub> nicotinic acetylcholine receptors revealed by chronic nicotine treatment and expression of subunit chimeras	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						nicotinic; acetylcholine receptor; folding; conformation; assembly; chimera	UP-REGULATION; ALPHA-BUNGAROTOXIN; CELL; BINDING; BRAIN; SUBTYPES; AGONIST; TEMPERATURE; PERSPECTIVE; SITES	Chronic exposure to nicotine, as occurs during tobacco smoking, is one of several factors that have been reported to cause an upregulation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here, the influence of both chronic exposure to nicotine (10 muM, 24 hr) and the coexpression of subunit chimeras has been examined in cultured cell lines expressing recombinant alpha4beta2 nAChRs, a major nicotinic receptor subtype expressed in the mammalian brain. Evidence is presented which demonstrates that both chronic exposure to nicotine and the coexpression of subunit chimeras upregulates levels of receptor expressed on the cell surface. Immunoblotting data indicate that neither chronic nicotine treatment nor coexpressed subunit partners greatly affect the level of total subunit protein. This finding, together with radioligand and antibody binding studies conducted on both intact and permeabilized cells, reveals that receptor upregulation corresponds to an increase in the proportion of total receptor expressed on the cell surface. It is also apparent that nicotine-induced nAChR upregulation is very strongly dependent on subunit composition and subunit domains. An important aspect of this study is that direct evidence has been obtained indicating that both chronic exposure to nicotine and coexpressed subunit partners can influence subunit conformation. The influence of chronic nicotine treatment on subunit folding may help to explain the phenomenon of nicotine-induced receptor upregulation. The finding that subunit conformation can be influenced by coassembled subunit partners is in agreement with models of receptor assembly which propose that subunit folding continues after initial subunit-subunit interactions.

Among them, 5-[4-(2-iodobenzylox,)phenyl]-3-(cyanoethyl) 1,3,4-oxadiazole-2(3H)one (2-IBPO) was found to have high inhibitory potency and selectivity toward MAO-B (IC50=2.0 nM, MAO-A/MAO-B >50000). Analysis of the inhibition kinetics indicated that 2-IBPO acts in a two-step mechanism as a competitive, slow, and tight-binding inhibitor of MAO-B with a Ki value of 2.4 nM and an overall Ki* value at an equilibrium of 3.8 nM. The new radioligand for MAO-B, [I-125]2-IBPO was conveniently synthesized from a tributylstannyl precursor by an iododestannylation reaction using sodium [I-125] iodide and hydrogen peroxide with high radiochemical yield. The in vivo tissue distribution studies of [I-125]2-IBPO demonstrated its high initial uptake and prolonged retention in the brain. A selective interaction of [I-125]2-IBPO with MAO-B was confirmed by the pretreatment experiment with well known MAO specific inhibitors, l-deprenyl, Ro-16-6491, clorgyline, and Ro-41-1049. These very desirable characteristics of [I-125]2-IBPO suggested that a I-123-labeled counterpart, [I-123]2-IBPO, would have great potential in in viva studies of MAO-B in the human brain with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).

We compared three approaches for quantifying extrastriatal D-2 dopamine receptors using [C-11]PLB 457. The PET measurements were performed on seven healthy men. Binding potential (BP) of [C-11]FLB 457 was calculated by the reference tissue model method, transient equilibrium method, and late time method. The reference tissue model describes the time-activity curve in a brain region in terms of that in the reference region, assuming that the levels of nondisplaceable radioligand binding in both regions are the same. The transient equilibrium theoretically occurs when the derivative for specific binding is zero. With the late time method, BP is calculated by integrating a late part of the time-activity curve. BP values obtained by all methods were in good agreement with those obtained by the kinetic approach, and the highest coefficient of correlation was observed in the reference tissue model method. In the simulation study, the error of BP calculated by the reference tissue model method was smallest. Moreover, the effect of the difference in the influx rate constant K-1 between the brain and the reference regions on BP was nearly avoided as theoretically predicted. We concluded that the reference tissue model method is most suitable for calculating BP of extrastriatal D-2 dopamine receptors with [C-11]FLB 457. (C) 2001 Academic Press.

Deuterated buprenorphine retains pharmacodynamic properties of buprenorphine and resists metabolism to the active metabolite norbuprenorphine in rats	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						buprenorphine; deuteration; prenatal; opioid use disorder; opioid receptors	NEONATAL ABSTINENCE SYNDROME; P-GLYCOPROTEIN; OPIOID USE; RECEPTORS; EXPOSURE; PHARMACOKINETICS; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; DEPENDENCE; PREGNANCY	Introduction: An active metabolite of buprenorphine (BUP), called norbuprenorphine (NorBUP), is implicated in neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome when BUP is taken during pregnancy. Therefore, reducing or eliminating metabolism of BUP to NorBUP is a novel strategy that will likely lower total fetal exposure to opioids and thus improve offspring outcomes. Precision deuteration alters pharmacokinetics of drugs without altering pharmacodynamics. Here, we report the synthesis and testing of deuterated buprenorphine (BUP-D2).Methods: We determined opioid receptor affinities of BUP-D2 relative to BUP with radioligand competition receptor binding assays, and the potency and efficacy of BUP-D2 relative to BUP to activate G-proteins via opioid receptors with [S-35]GTP?S binding assays in homogenates containing the human mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors. The antinociceptive effects of BUP-D2 and BUP were compared using the warm-water tail withdrawal assay in rats. Blood concentration versus time profiles of BUP, BUP-D2, and NorBUP were measured in rats following intravenous BUP-D2 or BUP injection.Results: The synthesis provided a 48% yield and the product was =99% deuterated. Like BUP, BUP-D2 had sub-nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors. BUP-D2 also activated opioid receptors and induced antinociception with equal potency and efficacy as BUP. The maximum concentration and the area under the curve of NorBUP in the blood of rats that received BUP-D2 were over 19- and 10-fold lower, respectively, than in rats that received BUP.Discussion: These results indicate that BUP-D2 retains key pharmacodynamic properties of BUP and resists metabolism to NorBUP and therefore holds promise as an alternative to BUP.

This study sought to prepare fluoro analogs of CPPC with higher affinity to provide the potential for labeling with longer-lived fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.8 min) and for delivery of higher CSF1R-specific PET signal in vivo. Seven fluorine-containing analogs of CPPC were prepared and four were found to have high inhibitory potency (IC50 in low to sub-nM range) and selectivity at CSF1R comparable with CPPC itself. One of these, a 4-fluoromethyl analog (Psa374), was investigated more deeply by labeling with carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) for PET studies in mouse and monkey. [C-11]Psa374 showed high peak uptake in monkey brain but not in mouse brain. Pharmacological challenges revealed no CSF1R-specific binding in either species at baseline. [C-11]CPPC also failed to show specific binding at baseline. Moreover, both [C-11]Psa374 and [C-11]CPPC showed brain efflux transporter substrate behavior in both species in vivo, although Psa374 did not show liability toward human efflux transporters in vitro. Further development of [C-11]Psa374 in non-human primate models of neuroinflammation with demonstration of CSF1Rspecific binding would be required to warrant the fluorine-18 labeling of Psa374 with a view to possible application in human subjects.

Ozanimod is metabolized in humans to form seven active plasma metabolites, including two major active metabolites CC112273 and CC1084037, and an inactive metabolite. Here, the binding and activity of ozanimod and its metabolites across human sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors were determined. Binding affinity was assessed in Chinese hamster ovary cell membranes expressing recombinant human sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5 via competitive radioligand binding using tritium-labeled ozanimod; selectivity via functional potency assessment was performed using [35S]-guanosine-5'-(gamma-thio)triphosphate binding assays. Receptor internalization was assessed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells overexpressing sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1-green fluorescent protein and Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 5-hemagglutinin via fluorescence activated cell sorting. Functional activity was assessed in primary cultures of human astrocytes via phosphorylation assays. Ozanimod and its functionally active metabolites bound to the same sites within sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5, with metabolites displaying the same selectivity profile as ozanimod. Agonism at sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 induced receptor internalization, whereas sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 5 did not. Ozanimod, CC112273, and CC1084037 elicited functional intracellular signaling in human astrocytes, pharmacologically characterized to be mediated by sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1. The active plasma metabolites of ozanimod bound to sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5 and displayed similar pharmacologic profiles as their parent compound, likely contributing to clinical efficacy in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis or moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis.

Altered Serotonin 2A (5-HT<sub>2A</sub>) Receptor Signaling Underlies Mild TBI-Elicited Deficits in Social Dominance	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						traumatic brain injury; serotonin; behavior; social dominance; serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A)	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER; AGONIST 8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN; RECOVERY; MODEL; DRUG	Various forms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are a leading cause of disability in the United States, with the generation of neuropsychiatric complications such as depression, anxiety, social dysfunction, and suicidality being common comorbidities. Serotonin (5-HT) signaling is linked to psychiatric disorders; however, the effects of neurotrauma on normal, homeostatic 5-HT signaling within the central nervous system (CNS) have not been well characterized. We hypothesize that TBI alters specific components of 5-HT signaling within the CNS and that the elucidation of specific TBI-induced alterations in 5-HT signaling may identify novel targets for pharmacotherapies that ameliorate the neuropsychiatric complications of TBI. Herein, we provide evidence that closed-head blast-induced mild TBI (mTBI) results in selective alterations in cortical 5-HT2A receptor signaling. We find that mTBI increases in vivo cortical 5-HT2A receptor sensitivity and ex vivo radioligand binding at time points corresponding with mTBI-induced deficits in social behavior. In contrast, in vivo characterizations of 5-HT1A receptor function revealed no effect of mTBI. Notably, we find that repeated pharmacologic activation of 5-HT2A receptors post-injury reverses deficits in social dominance resulting from mTBI. Cumulatively, these studies provide evidence that mTBI drives alterations in cortical 5-HT2A receptor function and that selective targeting of TBI-elicited alterations in 5-HT2A receptor signaling may represent a promising avenue for the development of pharmacotherapies for TBI-induced generation of neuropsychiatric disorders.

To increase the similarity to the lead compounds, an additional methyl moiety was installed in the 8-position of tricyclic oxazolobenzazepines, resulting in compounds 6. The additional methyl moiety originates from alanine, which was introduced by a Mitsunobu reaction of benzoxazolylethanol 7 with N-triflyl-protected alanine methyl ester. A crucial feature of the synthesis was the protection of the oxazolone ring by an allyl moiety, which was cleaved off at the end of the synthesis by RhCl3-catalyzed isomerization. Due to the additional methyl moiety, the intramolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation of acid 10 to afford ketone 11 required careful optimization to minimize the formation of the side product tetrahydroiso-quinoline 16. Alkylation or reductive alkylation of secondary amine 13 led to diastereomeric oxazolobenzazepines cis-14 and trans-14, which were separated by flash chromatography. Phenylbutyl derivatives cis-6a and trans-6a revealed twofold higher GluN2B affinity than analog 5a without 8-CH3 group. The methylated oxazolobenzazepines 6 and 14 did not interact with the phencyclidine binding site of NMDA receptors and sigma(2) receptors. However, the sigma(1) receptor preferred cis-configured oxazolobenzazepines. The highest sigma(1) receptor affinities were obtained for cis-14a (K-i = 26 nM) and cis-6b (K-i = 30 nM).

In the present study, we designed a novel ibuprofen-containing radioligand (Ibu-PSMA-02) with subtle structural changes regarding the linker entity in order to investigate a potential impact on the in vitro and in vivo properties. Ibu-PSMA-02 was prepared using solid-phase synthesis techniques and labeled with lutetium-177. [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 was evaluated in vitro with regard to its plasma protein-binding properties, PSMA affinity and uptake into PSMA-expressing PC-3 PIP tumor cells. The tissue distribution profile of [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 was assessed in tumor-bearing mice and dose estimations were performed. The in vitro characteristics of [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 were similar to those previously obtained for [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-01 with respect to plasma protein-binding, PSMA affinity and tumor cell uptake. The in vivo studies revealed, however, an unprecedentedly high uptake of [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 in PC-3 PIP tumors, resulting in an increased absorbed tumor dose of 7.7 Gy/MBq as compared to 5.1 Gy/MBq calculated for [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-01. As a consequence of the high tumor accumulation, [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-02 showed higher tumor-to-background ratios than [Lu-177]Lu-Ibu-PSMA-01. This study exemplified that smallest structural changes in the linker entity of PSMA radioligands may have a significant impact on their pharmacokinetic profiles and, thus, may be applied as a means for ligand design optimization.

Methods Nine inpatients were examined with positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [C-11]raclopride before and after an average of 8.4 ECT sessions. Treatment response was assessed using the Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale. Nine age- and sex-matched controls were examined twice with PET and [C-11]raclopride. Results [C-11]raclopride binding was significantly lower in all three subsections of striatum in patients compared to controls (Cohen's d(z), 1.14-1.68; P = 0.003-0.027). Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Ratings decreased significantly after ECT (P < 0.001; Cohen's d(z), 2.9). ECT had no statistically significant effect on [C-11]raclopride binding, although post-ECT binding estimates were more similar to those obtained in controls in all subsections of striatum. Conclusion Using PET and [C-11]raclopride, we found support for the notion that severe major depressive episodes are associated with significantly lower dopamine D-2/D-3 binding in all three subsections of striatum compared to controls. We noted no significant effect on D-2/D-3 binding in the patient group after response to ECT.

Using positron emission tomography (PET) technology, it is possible to monitor the physiological and pathological distribution of angiotensin II type 1 receptors (AT(1)), which reflects the functionality of RAS. A new F-18-labeled PET tracer derived from the clinically used AT(1) antagonist valsartan showing the least possible chemical alteration from the valsartan structure has been designed and synthesized with several strategies, which can be applied for the syntheses of further derivatives. Radioligand binding study showed that the cold reference FV45 (K-i 14.6 nM) has almost equivalent binding affinity as its lead valsartan (K-i 11.8 nM) and angiotensin II (K-i 1.7 nM). Successful radiolabeling of FV45 in a one-pot radiofluorination followed by the deprotection procedure with 21.8 +/- 8.5% radiochemical yield and >99% radiochemical purity (n = 5) enabled a distribution study in rats and opened a path to straightforward large-scale production. A fast and clear kidney uptake could be observed, and this renal uptake could be selectively blocked by pretreatment with AT(1)-selective antagonist valsartan. Overall, as the first F-18-labeled PET tracer based on a derivation from clinically used drug valsartan with almost identical chemical structure, [F-18]FV45 will be a new tool for assessing the RAS function by visualizing AT(1) receptor distributions and providing further information regarding cardiovascular system malfunction as well as possible applications in inflammation research and cancer diagnosis.

Impact of external cooling with icepacks on <SUP>68</SUP>Ga-PSMA uptake in salivary glands	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article							RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; PSMA; LU-177-PSMA-617; HUMANS; LIGAND; EANM	Background: External cooling of the salivary glands is advised to prevent xerostomia in lutetium-177-PSMA treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Since evidence addressing this subject is sparse, this study aims to determine impact of icepacks application on uptake in salivary glands. Eighty-nine patients referred for gallium-68-PSMA PET/CT for (re)staging of prostate cancer were prospectively included. Twenty-four patients were scanned with unilateral (solely left-sided) icepacks; 20 with bilateral icepacks; 45 without icepacks. Icepacks were applied approximately 30 minutes prior to tracer injection. PET/CT acquisition started 1 hour postinjection. Radiotracer uptake was measured in the parotid- and submandibular glands. Results: When comparing the intervention group with the control group, uptake in the left parotid gland significantly differed: SUVmax: 11.07 +/- 3.53 versus 12.95 +/- 4.16; p = 0.02. SUVpeak: 9.91 +/- 3.14 versus 11.45 +/- 3.61; p = 0.04. SUVmax and SUVpeak were reduced with 14.52% and 13.45%. All other SUV values did not significantly differ. Patients with bilateral icepacks showed no significant differences in PSMA uptake compared to the control group (all: p > 0.05). Intra-patient analysis revealed some significant differences in SUVmax and SUVpeak between the cooled and non-cooled parotid gland (SUVmax: 11.12 +/- 3.71 versus 12.69 +/- 3.75; p = 0.00. SUVpeak: 9.93 +/- 3.32 versus 11.25 +/- 3.25; p = 0.00). Conclusions: Impact of icepacks on PSMA uptake seems to be limited to the parotid glands. As clinical relevance of these findings is debatable, structural application of icepacks in the setting of lutetium-177 PSMA therapy needs careful consideration.	[van Kalmthout, Ludwike W.

As opposed to conventional in vitro assays, integrated receptor-mediated cellular responses are determined in real-time rather than a single downstream signaling pathway. In this study, we examined the potential of a label-free whole cell impedance-based biosensor system (i.e. xCELLigence) to study the pharmacology of one GPCR in particular, the mGlu(2) receptor. This receptor is a target for the treatment of several psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia and depression. After optimization of assay conditions to prevent interference of endogenous glutamate in the culture medium, detailed pharmacological assessments were performed. Concentration-response curves showed a concentration-dependent increase in impedance for agonists and positive allosteric modulators, whereas receptor inhibition by an antagonist or negative allosteric modulator resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in cellular impedance. Interestingly, constitutive receptor activity was observed that was decreased by LY341495, which therefore behaved as an inverse agonist here, a property that was heretofore unappreciated. This was confirmed by concentration-dependent modulation of LY341495 potency and efficacy by a allosteric modulators. In summary, the use of the xCELLigence system to study mGlu(2) receptor pharmacology was validated.

Association of Protein Distribution and Gene Expression Revealed by PET and Post-Mortem Quantification in the Serotonergic System of the Human Brain	CEREBRAL CORTEX			English	Article						MAO-A; mRNA; SERT; 5-HT1A; 5-HT2A	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MONOAMINE-OXIDASE-A; MESSENGER-RNA; 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; SEROTONIN(2A) RECEPTORS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; MAO-A; TRANSPORTER; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND	Regional differences in posttranscriptional mechanisms may influence in vivo protein densities. The association of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging data from 112 healthy controls and gene expression values from the Allen Human Brain Atlas, based on post-mortem brains, was investigated for key serotonergic proteins. PET binding values and gene expression intensities were correlated for the main inhibitory (5-HT1A) and excitatory (5-HT2A) serotonin receptor, the serotonin transporter (SERT) as well as monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), using Spearman's correlation coefficients (r(s)) in a voxel-wise and region-wise analysis. Correlations indicated a strong linear relationship between gene and protein expression for both the 5-HT1A (voxel-wise r(s) = 0.71; region-wise r(s) = 0.93) and the 5-HT2A receptor (r(s) = 0.66; 0.75), but only a weak association for MAO-A (r(s) = 0.26; 0.66) and no clear correlation for SERT (r(s) = 0.17; 0.29). Additionally, region-wise correlations were performed using mRNA expression from the HBT, yielding comparable results (5-HT1A r(s) = 0.82; 5-HT2A r(s) = 0.88; MAO-A r(s) = 0.50; SERT r(s) = -0.01). The SERT and MAO-A appear to be regulated in a region-specific manner across the whole brain. In contrast, the serotonin-1A and -2A receptors are presumably targeted by common posttranscriptional processes similar in all brain areas suggesting the applicability of mRNA expression as surrogate parameter for density of these proteins.

Molecular mechanism of positive allosteric modulation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 by JNJ-46281222	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; STRUCTURAL INSIGHTS; HEPTAHELICAL DOMAIN; POTENT; DISCOVERY; BINDING; DETERMINANTS; SIMULATIONS; ACTIVATION; MGLUR2	Background and PurposeAllosteric modulation of the mGlu(2) receptor is a potential strategy for treatment of various neurological and psychiatric disorders. Here, we describe the in vitro characterization of the mGlu(2) positive allosteric modulator (PAM) JNJ-46281222 and its radiolabelled counterpart [H-3]-JNJ-46281222. Using this novel tool, we also describe the allosteric effect of orthosteric glutamate binding and the presence of a bound G protein on PAM binding and use computational approaches to further investigate the binding mode. Experimental ApproachWe have used radioligand binding studies, functional assays, site-directed mutagenesis, homology modelling and molecular dynamics to study the binding of JNJ-46281222. Key ResultsJNJ-46281222 is an mGlu(2)-selective, highly potent PAM with nanomolar affinity (K-D = 1.7 nM). Binding of [H-3]-JNJ-46281222 was increased by the presence of glutamate and greatly reduced by the presence of GTP, indicating the preference for a G protein bound state of the receptor for PAM binding. Its allosteric binding site was visualized and analysed by a computational docking and molecular dynamics study. The simulations revealed amino acid movements in regions expected to be important for activation. The binding mode was supported by [H-3]-JNJ-46281222 binding experiments on mutant receptors. Conclusion and ImplicationsOur results obtained with JNJ-46281222 in unlabelled and tritiated form further contribute to our understanding of mGlu(2) allosteric modulation. The computational simulations and mutagenesis provide a plausible binding mode with indications of how the ligand permits allosteric activation. This study is therefore of interest for mGlu(2) and class C receptor drug discovery.	[Doornbos, Maarten L.

Monetary discounting and ventral striatal dopamine receptor availability in nontreatment-seeking alcoholics and social drinkers	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nucleus accumbens; Neuroimaging; Neuroeconomics; Intertemporal choice; Alcohol abuse; Ethanol; Impulsivity; Positron emission tomography; Raclopride; Mesolimbic	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; D-AMPHETAMINE; IMPULSIVITY; RATS; SELF; REWARD; RELIABILITY; PET; AGE	Dopamine (DA) in the ventral striatum (VST) has long been implicated in addiction pathologies, yet its role in temporal decision-making is not well-understood. To determine if VST DA D-2 receptor availability corresponds with greater impulsive choice in both nontreatment-seeking alcoholics (NTS) and social drinkers (SD). NTS subjects (n = 10) and SD (n = 13) received PET scans at baseline with the D-2/D-3 radioligand [C-11]raclopride (RAC). Outside the scanner, subjects performed a delay discounting procedure with monetary rewards. RAC binding potential (BPND) was estimated voxelwise, and correlations were performed to test for relationships between VST BPND and delay discounting performance. Self-reported impulsivity was also tested for correlations with BPND. Across all subjects, greater impulsive choice for $20 correlated with lower BPND in the right VST. NTS showed greater impulsive choice than SD and were more impulsive by self-report. Across all subjects, the capacity of larger rewards to reduce impulsive choice (the magnitude effect) correlated negatively (p = 0.028) with problematic alcohol use (AUDIT) scores. Self-reported impulsivity did not correlate with BPND in VST. Preference for immediate reinforcement may reflect greater endogenous striatal DA or lower D-2 number, or both. Alcoholic status did not mediate significant effects on VST BPND, suggesting minimal effects from alcohol exposure. The apparent lack of BPND correlation with self-reported impulsivity highlights the need for objective behavioral assays in the study of the neurochemical substrates of behavior. Finally, our results suggest that the magnitude effect may be more sensitive to alcohol-induced problems than single discounting measures.

Its efficacy has been shown in several forms of anxiety disorders. Findings from preclinical and clinical studies attribute a major role to the serotonin-1A receptor in the pathogenesis and treatment of anxiety. Methods: To elucidate the effect of Silexan on serotonin-1A receptor binding, 17 healthy men underwent 2 positron emission tomography measurements using the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 following the daily intake of 160 mg Silexan or placebo for a minimum of 8 weeks (randomized, double-blind, cross-over design). Additionally, structural magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry analysis was performed to determine potential effects on gray matter microstructure. Results: Serotonin-1A receptor binding potential was shown to be significantly reduced following the intake of Silexan compared with placebo in 2 large clusters encompassing the temporal gyrus, the fusiform gyrus and the hippocampus on one hand as well as the insula and anterior cingulate cortex on the other hand. No effects of Silexan on gray matter volume could be detected in this investigation. Conclusion: This positron emission tomography study proposes an involvement of the serotonin-1A receptor in the anxiolytic effects of Silexan.

Jeffrey			Probing the Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 (mGlu<sub>5</sub>) Positive Allosteric Modulator (PAM) Binding Pocket: Discovery of Point Mutations That Engender a "Molecular Switch" in PAM Pharmacology	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; RAT BEHAVIORAL-MODELS; IN-VIVO ACTIVITY; NONCOMPETITIVE ANTAGONISTS; TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN; ANTIPSYCHOTIC-LIKE; SITE; SUBTYPE-5; MPEP; ACTIVATION	Positive allosteric modulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu(5)) is a promising novel approach for the treatment of schizophrenia and cognitive disorders. Allosteric binding sites are topographically distinct from the endogenous ligand (orthosteric) binding site, allowing for co-occupation of a single receptor with the endogenous ligand and an allosteric modulator. Negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) inhibit and positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) enhance the affinity and/or efficacy of the orthosteric agonist. The molecular determinants that govern mGlu(5) modulator affinity versus cooperativity are not well understood. Focusing on the modulators based on the acetylene scaffold, we sought to determine the molecular interactions that contribute to PAM versus NAM pharmacology. Generation of a comparative model of the transmembrane-spanning region of mGlu(5) served as a tool to predict and interpret the impact of mutations in this region. Application of an operational model of allosterism allowed for determination of PAM and NAM affinity estimates at receptor constructs that possessed no detectable radioligand binding as well as delineation of effects on affinity versus cooperativity. Novel mutations within the transmembrane domain (TM) regions were identified that had differential effects on acetylene PAMs versus 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine, a prototypical NAM. Three conserved amino acids (Y658, T780, and S808) and two nonconserved residues (P654 and A809) were identified as key determinants of PAM activity. Interestingly, we identified two point mutations in TMs 6 and 7 that, when mutated, engender a mode switch in the pharmacology of certain PAMs.	[Gregory, Karen J.; Reiff, Sean D.; Squire, Emma F.; Stauffer, Shaun R.; Lindsley, Craig W.; Conn, P.

The goal of these experiments was to determine how nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) expression is related to two forms of cost benefit decision making. Male Long Evans rats were tested in probability- and delay-discounting tasks, which required discrete trial choices between a small reward and a large reward associated with varying probabilities of omission and varying delays to reward delivery, respectively. Following testing, radioligand binding to alpha 4 beta 2* and alpha 7 nAChR subtypes in brain regions implicated in cost benefit decision making was examined. Significant linear relationships were observed between choice of the large delayed reward in the delay discounting task and alpha 4 beta 2* receptor binding in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Additionally, trends were found suggesting that choice of the large costly reward in both discounting tasks was inversely related to alpha 4 beta 2* receptor binding in the medial prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens shell. Similar trends suggested that choice of the large delayed reward in the delay discounting task was inversely related to alpha 4 beta 2* receptor binding in the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens core, and basolateral amygdala, as well as to alpha 7 receptor binding in the basolateral amygdala. These data suggest that nAChRs (particularly alpha 4 beta 2*) play both unique and common roles in decisions that require consideration of different types of reward costs. (C) 2012 IBRO.

MAO-A is responsible for the degradation of different neurotransmitters and is implicated in several neurologic and psychiatric illnesses. This study sought to estimate the distribution volume (V-T) values of [C-11]befloxatone in humans using an arterial input function. Methods: Seven healthy volunteers were imaged with positron emission tomography (PET) after [C-11]befloxatone injection. Kinetic analysis was performed using an arterial input function in association with compartmental modeling and with the Logan plot, multilinear analysis (MA1), and standard spectral analysis (SA) at both the regional and voxel level. Arterialized venous samples were drawn as an alternative and less invasive input function. Results: An unconstrained two-compartment model reliably quantified V-T values in large brain regions. A constrained model did not significantly improve V-T identifiability. Similar V-T results were obtained using SA; however, the Logan plot and MA1 slightly underestimated V-T values (about -10%). At the voxel level, SA showed a very small bias (+ 2%) compared to compartmental modeling, Logan severely underestimated V-T values, and voxel-wise images obtained with MA1 were too noisy to be reliably quantified. Arterialized venous blood samples did not provide a satisfactory alternative input function as the Logan-V-T regional values were not comparable to those obtained with arterial sampling in all subjects. Conclusions: Binding of [C-11]befloxatone to MAO-A can be quantified using an arterial input function and a two-compartment model or, in parametric images, with SA.

These main metabolites of nalfurafine showed the low affinities for human kappa-, mu- and delta-opioid receptors except for the affinity of de-CPM to kappa-opioid receptor (inhibition constant (Ki) values: 5.95 nmol/l), which was 24 times lower than that of nalfurafine. Moreover, the main metabolites of nalfurafine had much lower agonistic activities than that of nalfurafine for three opioid receptors in forskolin-stimulated cAMP assays. In the substance P-induced mouse scratching behavior, the subcutaneous administration of each metabolite did not statistically significantly reduce the scratching behavior at doses up to 1000 mu g/kg which was 100 times higher than the effective dose of nalfurafine. These findings suggest that the main metabolites of nalfurafine do not make any contribution to its pharmacological actions including antipruritic effects in vivo. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Spontaneous seminal emission in male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats was studied during the 3-day observation period. The characteristics of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the seminal vesicle and epididymal and prostatic portion of vas deferens of the two strains were determined using an isolated muscle bath. radioligand receptor binding and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction techniques. SHRs had significantly higher serum testosterone than WKY rats. However, the daily mean number of ejaculatory plugs emitted and their dry weight in SHRs were significantly lower than those in WKY rats. Although there was no significant difference in the properties of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in the prostatic portion of vas deferens between SHRs and WKY rats, the maximum contractile responses to phenylephrine, total alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density and expression of alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor mRNA were significantly higher in the seminal vesicle and epididymal portion of vas deferens of SHRs vs. WKY rats. Our data demonstrate the presence of hypertension related alterations in serum testosterone and in alpha(1)-adrenergic responsiveness of the rat seminal vesicle and vas deferens and suggest that ejaculatory function in SHRs does not mirror these hypertension related alterations.

However, modifications in dopaminergic neurotransmission associated with long-term tobacco and cannabis use have been poorly documented in vivo. In order to assess striatal and extrastriatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability in tobacco and cannabis addiction, three groups of male age-matched subjects were compared: 11 healthy non-smoker subjects, 14 tobacco-dependent smokers (17.6 +/- 5.3 cigarettes/day for 12.1 +/- 8.5 years) and 13 cannabis and tobacco smokers (CTS) (4.8 +/- 5.3 cannabis joints/day for 8.7 +/- 3.9 years). DAT availability was examined in positron emission tomography (HRRT) with a high resolution research tomograph after injection of [11C]PE2I, a selective DAT radioligand. Region of interest and voxel-by-voxel approaches using a simplified reference tissue model were performed for the between-group comparison of DAT availability. Measurements in the dorsal striatum from both analyses were concordant and showed a mean 20% lower DAT availability in drug users compared with controls. Whole-brain analysis also revealed lower DAT availability in the ventral striatum, the midbrain, the middle cingulate and the thalamus (ranging from -15 to -30%). The DAT availability was slightly lower in all regions in CTS than in subjects who smoke tobacco only, but the difference does not reach a significant level. These results support the existence of a decrease in DAT availability associated with tobacco and cannabis addictions involving all dopaminergic brain circuits. These findings are consistent with the idea of a global decrease in cerebral DA activity in dependent subjects.

Twelve healthy subjects (age (y): 39.8; SD = 15.8) underwent a single dynamic Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning session after intravenous administration of 185.2 (SD = 10.2) MBq [F-18]fallypride. Psychosocial stress was initiated at 100 min postinjection. PET data were analyzed using the linearized simplified reference region model (LSRRM), which accounts for time-dependent changes in [F-18]fallypride displacement. Voxel-based statistical maps, representing specific D-2/3 binding changes, were computed to localize areas with increased ligand displacement after task initiation, reflecting dopamine release. The psychosocial stress challenge induced detectable amounts of dopamine release throughout the prefrontal cortex, with dopaminergic activity in bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex being associated with subjectively rated experiences of psychosocial stress. The novel finding that a mild psychosocial stress in humans induces increased levels of endogenous dopamine in the PFC indicates that the dynamics of the dopamine-related stress response cannot be interpreted by focusing on mesolimbic brain regions alone.

Decreased GABA<sub>A</sub> Receptor Binding in the Medullary Serotonergic System in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome	JOURNAL OF NEUROPATHOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY			English	Article						Autoradiography; Arcuate nucleus; Autoradiography; Homeostasis; Hypoxia; Raphe	ROSTRAL VENTRAL MEDULLA; PRE-BOTZINGER COMPLEX; NUCLEUS PARAGIGANTOCELLULARIS LATERALIS; RESPIRATORY RHYTHM GENERATION; BRAIN-STEM ABNORMALITIES; MEDIATED INHIBITION; SYNAPTIC INHIBITION; COTRANSPORTER KCC2; MUSCIMOL DIALYSIS; ARCUATE NUCLEUS	gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons in the medulla oblongata help regulate homeostasis, in part through interactions with the medullary serotonergic (5-HT) system. Previously, we reported abnormalities in multiple 5-HT markers in the medullary 5-HT system of infants dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), suggesting that 5-HT dysfunction is involved in its pathogenesis. Here, we tested the hypothesis that markers of GABA(A) receptors are decreased in the medullary 5-HT system in SIDS cases compared with controls. Using tissue receptor autoradiography with the radioligand H-3-GABA, we found 25% to 52% reductions in GABAA receptor binding density in 7 of 10 key nuclei sampled of the medullary 5-HT system in the SIDS cases (postconceptional age [PCA] = 51.7 +/- 8.3, n = 28) versus age-adjusted controls (PCA = 55.3 +/- 13.5, n = 8) (p <= 0.04). By Western blotting, there was 46.2% reduction in GABA(A alpha 3) subunit levels in the gigantocellularis (component of the medullary 5-HT system) of SIDS cases (PCA = 53.9 T 8.4, n = 24) versus controls (PCA = 55.3 +/- 8.3, n = 8) (56.8% standard in SIDS cases vs 99.35% in controls; p = 0.026). These data suggest that medullary GABAA receptors are abnormal in SIDS infants and that SIDS is a complex disorder of a homeostatic network in the medulla that involves deficits of the GABAergic and 5-HT systems.

Distinct pharmacological properties of morphine metabolites at G<sub>i</sub>-protein and β-arrestin signaling pathways activated by the human μ-opioid receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Morphine; Metabolite; FRET; G-protein; beta-Arrestin	PROTEIN-ACTIVATION; INTACT-CELLS; BINDING; MORPHINE-6-SULFATE; PHARMACOKINETICS; MECHANISMS; RESONANCE; KINETICS; RAT	Morphine and several other opioids are important drugs for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. Opioid-induced analgesia is predominantly mediated by the mu-opioid receptor (MOR). When administered to humans, complex metabolic pathways lead to generation of many metabolites, nine of which may be considered major metabolites. While the properties of the two main compounds, morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide, are well described, the activity of other morphine metabolites is largely unknown. Here we performed an extensive pharmacological characterization by comparing efficacies and potencies of morphine and its nine major metabolites for the two main signaling pathways engaged by the human MOR, which occur via G(i)-protein activation and beta-arrestins, respectively. We used radioligand binding studies and FRET-based methods to monitor MOR-mediated G(i)-protein activation and beta-arrestin recruitment in single intact 2931 cells. This approach identified two major groups of morphine metabolites, which we classified into "strong" and "weak" receptor ligands. Strong partial agonists morphine, morphine-6-glucuronide, normorphine, morphine-6-sulfate, 6-acetylmorphine and 3-acetylmorphine showed efficacies in the nanomolar range, while the weak metabolites morphine-N-oxide, morphine-3-sulfate, morphine-3-glucuronide and pseudomorphine activated MOR pathways only in the micromolar range. Interestingly, three metabolites, normorphine, 6-acetylmorphine and morphine-6-glucuronide, had lower potencies for Gi-protein activation but higher potencies and efficacies for beta-arrestin recruitment than morphine itself, suggesting that they are biased towards beta-arrestin pathways.

To target the specific GHB binding sites, we have developed a I-125-labeled GHB analog and characterized its binding in rat brain homogenate and slices. Our data show that [I-125]4-hydroxy-4-[4-(2-iodobenzyloxy) phenyl]butanoate ([I-125]BnOPh-GHB) binds to one site in rat brain cortical membranes with low nanomolar affinity (K-d, 7 nM; B-max, 61 pmol/mg protein). The binding is inhibited by GHB and selected analogs, but not by gamma-aminobutyric acid. Autoradiography using horizontal slices from rat brain demonstrates the highest density of binding in hippocampus and cortical regions and the lowest density in the cerebellum. Altogether, the findings correlate with the labeling and brain regional distribution of high-affinity GHB sites or [H-3](E,RS)-(6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-5-hydroxy-5H-benzocyclohept-6-ylidene)acetic acid ([H-3]NCS-382) binding sites. Using a I-125-labeled photoaffinity derivative of the new GHB ligand, we have performed denaturing protein electrophoresis and detected one major protein band with an apparent mass of 50 kDa from cortical and hippocampal membranes. [I-125]BnOPh-GHB is the first reported I-125-labeled GHB radioligand and is a useful tool for in vitro studies of the specific high-affinity GHB binding sites. The related photoaffinity linker [I-125]4-hydroxy-4-[4-(2-azido-5(-)odobenzyloxy)phenyl]butanoate can be used as a probe for isolation of the elusive GHB binding protein.

Effects of Betahistine at Histamine H<sub>3</sub> Receptors: Mixed Inverse Agonism/Agonism In Vitro and Partial Inverse Agonism In Vivo	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; VESTIBULAR COMPENSATION; DOUBLE-BLIND; GUINEA-PIG; RAT-BRAIN; BINDING; LIGANDS; CAT; DIHYDROCHLORIDE; RADIOLIGAND	We previously suggested that therapeutic effects of betahistine in vestibular disorders result from its antagonist properties at histamine H-3 receptors (H(3)Rs). However, H(3)Rs exhibit constitutive activity, and most H3R antagonists act as inverse agonists. Here, we have investigated the effects of betahistine at recombinant H3R isoforms. On inhibition of cAMP formation and [H-3] arachidonic acid release, betahistine behaved as a nanomolar inverse agonist and a micromolar agonist. Both effects were suppressed by pertussis toxin, were found at all isoforms tested, and were not detected in mock cells, confirming interactions at H(3)Rs. The inverse agonist potency of betahistine and its affinity on [I-125] iodoproxyfan binding were similar in rat and human. We then investigated the effects of betahistine on histamine neuron activity by measuring tele-methylhis-tamine (t-MeHA) levels in the brains of mice. Its acute intraperitoneal administration increased t-MeHA levels with an ED50 of 0.4 mg/kg, indicating inverse agonism. At higher doses, t-MeHA levels gradually returned to basal levels, a profile probably resulting from agonism. After acute oral administration, betahistine increased t-MeHA levels with an ED50 of 2 mg/kg, a rightward shift probably caused by almost complete first-pass metabolism. In each case, the maximal effect of betahistine was lower than that of ciproxifan, indicating partial inverse agonism. After an oral 8-day treatment, the only effective dose of betahistine was 30 mg/kg, indicating that a tolerance had developed. These data strongly suggest that therapeutic effects of betahistine result from an enhancement of histamine neuron activity induced by inverse agonism at H-3 autoreceptors.

The aim was to estimate the proportion of undiagnosed celiac disease in children with HLA risk at 3 years of age. Patients and Methods: From a population-based HLA-DQ screening Study of newborns born between June 2001 and August 2004 in the southern part of Sweden, 6206 children with HLA-risk alleles were identified and asked to participate at a mean 3.3 +/- 0.4 years of age. As controls, 7654 children with HLA-nonrisk alleles were asked to participate. In all, 1620 (26.1%) children with HLA risk and 1815 (23.7%) controls were screened for tTGAb using radioligand-binding assays. Celiac disease was established by intestinal biopsy in children with a confirmed positive tTGAb test. Results: Twenty-three children reported already having clinically diagnosed celiac disease and did not participate further. In children with HLA-risk genotypes, 73 of 1620 (4.5%, 95% CI 3.5%-5.5%) were tTGAb-positive compared with none of 1815 from the controls (P < 0.0001). Seventy-one children underwent biopsy (I refused biopsy and I biopsy failed), of whom 56 of 1618 (3.5%, 95% CI 2.6%-4.4%) had damaged intestinal mucosa classified as celiac disease, The ratio between clinically and screening detected celiac disease in this study was 1:2.4 (23:56). Conclusions: The proportion of clinically undetected celiac disease may be particularly high among 3-year-old children with HLA-DQB1*02 and DQB1*0302 in Sweden, where these 2 HLA-risk alleles frequently occur.

Properties of estrogen binding components in the plasma membrane of neurohypophysis in hens and changes in its binding before and after oviposition	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						hen neurohypophysis; estrogen receptor binding; plasma membrane; arginine vasotocin release; oviposition cycle	UTERUS SHELL GLAND; ARGININE VASOTOCIN; RECEPTOR-BINDING; OVULATORY CYCLE; JAPANESE-QUAIL; DOMESTIC-FOWL; PROGESTERONE; MESOTOCIN; PITUITARY; ESTRADIOL-17-BETA	The present study was performed to elucidate whether the estrogen binding component regarded as a receptor exists in the plasma membrane fraction of neurohypophysis in hens and whether the binding of receptor changes with relation to oviposition. The specific binding for estradiol-17 beta (E-2) in the neurohypophysis of hens was demonstrated by the use of radioligand binding assays on the plasma membrane fraction of the tissue. The binding to [H-3]E-2 had a binding specificity to E2 and diethylstilbestrol, reversibility, and saturation. Scatchard analysis revealed that the binding sites are of a single class. The equilibrium dissociation constant obtained by Scatchard analysis and kinetic analysis suggested a high affinity, and the maximum binding capacity obtained by Scatchard analysis suggested a limited capacity. These properties are characteristics of a receptor, which suggests that an estrogen receptor exists in the plasma membrane of hen neurohypophysis. The equilibrium dissociation constant value of estrogen receptor of the neurohypophysis was not significantly different between laying hens and nonlaying hens, but the maximum binding capacity value was statistically smaller (the binding affinity is higher) in laying hens than in nonlaying hens. The specific binding of estrogen receptor showed a decrease at 1 h after an injection of diethylstilbestrol in nonlaying hens. The specific binding also decreased 3 h before oviposition in laying hens and maintained low value until just after oviposition. The present study suggests that estrogen may act directly on the neurohypophysis during 3 h before oviposition in hens.

This report outlines an approach for the development of novel ligands homing selectively to islet cells in vivo. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-To generate agents specifically binding to pancreatic islets, a phage library was screened for single-chain antibodies (SCAs) on rat islets usmig two different approaches. 1) The library was injected into rats in vivo, and islets were isolated after a circulation time of 5 min. 2) Pancreatic islets were directly isolated, and the library was panned in the islets in vitro. Subsequently, the identified SCAs were extensively characterized in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS-We report the generation of SCAs that bind highly selective to either beta- or alpha-cells. These SCAs are internalized by target cells, disappear rapidly from the vasculature, and exert no toxicity in vivo. Specific binding to beta- or alpha-cells was detected in cell lines in vitro, in rats in vivo, and in human tissue in situ. Electron microscopy demonstrated binding of SCAs to the endoplasmatic reticulum and the secretory granules. FInally, in a biodistribution study the labeling intensity derived from [I-125]-labeled SCAs after intravenous administration in rats strongly predicted the beta-cell mass and was inversely related to the glucose excursions during an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. CONCLUSIONS-Our data provide strong evidence that the presented SCAs are highly specific for pancreatic beta-cells and enable imaging and quantification in vivo.

All possible stereoisomers of the 2-hydroxy, 2-methoxy, 2,2-dimethoxy, 2-oxo, and 2-unsubstituted 6,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonanes were prepared in a chiral pool synthesis starting with (S)- and (R)-glutamate. A Dieckmann analogous cyclization was the key step in the synthesis of the bicyclic framework. The configuration in position 2 was established by a diastereoselective LiBH4 reduction and subsequent Mitsunobu inversion. Structure-affinity relationships demonstrate that substituents in position 2 decrease sigma(1) receptor affinity which might be due to unfavorable interactions with the sigma(1) receptor protein. Without a substituent in position 2 high sigma(1) affinity was obtained (23a ((+)-(1S, 5S)-6-allyl-8-(4-methoxybenzyl)-6,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.2] nonane): K-i = 11 nM). Experiments with six human tumor cell lines showed a weak but selective growth inhibition of the human small cell lung cancer cell line A-427 by the methyl ethers ent-16b (IC50 = 18.9 mu M), 21a (IC50 = 16.4 mu M), ent-21a (IC50 = 20.4 mu M), and 21b (IC50 = 27.1 mu M) and the unsubstituted compounds 23a and 23b (42% inhibition at 20 mu M).

Developmental neurotoxicity of parathion: Progressive effects on serotonergic systems in adolescence and adulthood	NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY			English	Article						Organophosphate pesticides; Parathion; Serotonin receptors; Serotonin transporter; Sex-selective neurotoxicity	NEONATAL CHLORPYRIFOS EXPOSURE; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BRAIN-CELL DEVELOPMENT; ORGANOPHOSPHATE INSECTICIDES; BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS; PESTICIDE APPLICATORS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RECEPTOR-BINDING; CRITICAL PERIODS; RATS	Neonatal exposures to organophosphates that are not acutely symptomatic or that produce little or no cholinesterase inhibition can nevertheless compromise the development and later function of critical neural pathways, including serotonin (5HT) systems that regulate emotional behaviors. We administered parathion to newborn rats on postnatal days (PN) 1-4 at doses spanning the threshold for detectable cholinesterase inhibition (0.1 mg/kg/day) and the first signs of loss of viability (0.2 mg/kg/day). In adolescence (PN30), young adulthood (PN60) and full adulthood (PN100), we measured radioligand binding to 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2) receptors, and to the 5HT transporter in the brain regions comprising all the major 5HT projections and 5HT cell bodies. Parathion caused a biphasic effect over later development with initial, widespread upregulation of 5HT1A receptors that peaked in the frontal/parietal cortex by PN60, followed by a diminution of that effect in most regions and emergence of deficits at PN100. There were smaller, but statistically significant changes in 5HT2 receptors and the 5HT transporter. These findings stand in strong contrast to previous results with neonatal exposure to a different organophosphate, chlorpyrifos, which evoked parallel upregulation of all three 5HT synaptic proteins that persisted from adolescence through full adulthood and that targeted males much more than females. Our results support the view that the various organophosphates have disparate effects on 5HT systems, distinct from their shared property as cholinesterase inhibitors, and the targeting of 5HT function points toward the importance of studying the impact of these agents on 5HT-linked behaviors.

Calcium modulation of 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor binding and function	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin; Cys-loop; Channel; Pore; Extracellular domain; Modulation; Calcium; 5-HT3	DIVALENT-CATIONS; LIGAND-BINDING; MONOVALENT CATIONS; AGONIST-BINDING; SITE; CA2+; MUTAGENESIS; CONDUCTION; SUBUNIT; DOMAIN	Calcium modulates the 5-HT3 receptor response by reducing peak current amplitude and increasing rates of activation, deactivation and desensitisation, but the binding site(s) and mechanism(s) of this modulation are unknown. Here we study residues that may be involved in calcium binding in two partially overlapping regions of the extracellular domain (E213-E215-E218 and D204-E218-V219). The modulatory effects of calcium were assessed by radioligand binding and whole-cell patch-clamp. Comparisons of [H-3]granisetron binding showed an increase in K-d in 10 mM calcium that was abolished by the substitutions E213Q, E215Q, D204N and V219L. E218Q mutant receptors displayed no specific binding or function, and immunofluorescence showed that they did not reach the cell surface. E213Q increased inherent rates of desensitisation, but the relative effects of calcium on these rates, and on the reduction in current amplitude, were similar to wild type receptors. Current responses and calcium-mediated effects at E215Q mutant receptors were indistinguishable from wild type. D204N and V219L mutants were non-functional. A calcium impermeable mutant (E277A/S297R) revealed no changes in peak amplitude or kinetics with increased calcium. Our results are consistent with residues D204, E218 and V219 participating in receptor assembly, structure and/or trafficking to the plasma membrane, and we speculate that this might rely upon the stabilising effect of bound calcium. E213, E215, D204 and V219 may contribute to a calcium binding site that is responsible for the calcium-mediated effects on ligand binding. However, the major site for calcium-dependent modulation of the 5-HT3 current is located within the ion channel or cell interior. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Growth hormone-releasing hormone as an agonist of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						Ghrelin; Ghrelin receptor; GHRH	VASOACTIVE-INTESTINAL-PEPTIDE; PRIMARY PITUITARY-CELLS; GH SECRETION; ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; HYPOTHALAMIC LEVEL; MAIN ACTION; IN-VITRO; ANTAGONISTS; SECRETAGOGUE	Ghrelin synergizes with growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) to potentiate growth hormone (GH) response through a mechanism not yet fully characterized. This study was conducted to analyze the role of GHRH as a potential ligand of the ghrelin receptor, GHS-R1a. The results show that hGHRH(1-29)NH2 (GHRH) induces a dose-dependent calcium mobilization in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with GHS-R1a an effect not observed in wildtype HEK 293 cells. This calcium rise is also observed using the GHRH receptor agonists JI-34 and JI-36. Radioligand binding and cross-linking studies revealed that calcium response to GHRH is mediated by the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a. GHRH activates the signaling route of inositol phosphate and potentiates the maximal response to ghrelin measured in inositol phosphate turnover. The presence of GHRH increases the binding capacity of I-125-ghrelin in a dose dependent-fashion showing a positive binding cooperativity. In addition, confocal microscopy in CHO cells transfected with GHS-R1a tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein shows that GHRH activates the GHS-R1a endocytosis. Furthermore, the selective GHRH-R antagonists, JV-1-42 and JMR-132, act also as antagonists of the ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a. Our findings suggest that GHRH interacts with ghrelin receptor GHS-R1a, and, in consequence, modifies the ghrelin-associated intracellular signaling pathway. This interaction may represent a form of regulation, which could play a putative role in the physiology of GH regulation and appetite control.

Hit / lead optimization, which represents the next step and the longest for the medicinal chemist, is very rarely considered. This is not surprising because lead optimization is a much more complex task. Here, a homology model of the histamine H-3 receptor was built and tested for its ability to discriminate ligands above a defined threshold of affinity. In addition, drug safety is also evaluated during lead optimization, and "antitargets" are studied. So, we have used the same benchmarking procedure with the HERG channel and CYP2D6 enzyme, for which a minimal affinity is strongly desired. For targets and antitargets, we report here an accuracy as high as at least 70%, for ligands being classified above or below the chosen threshold. Such a good result is beyond what could have been predicted, especially, since our test conditions were particularly stringent. First, we measured the accuracy by means of AUC of ROC plots, i.e. considering both false positive and false negatives. Second, we used as datasets extensive chemical libraries (nearly a thousand ligands for H-3). All molecules considered were true H-3 receptor ligands with moderate to high affinity (from mu M to nM range). Third, the database is issued from concrete SAR (Bioprojet H-3 BF2.649 library) and is not simply constituted by few active ligands buried in a chemical catalogue.

Mesotocin receptor binding in oviduct uterus of the hen before and after oviposition	POULTRY SCIENCE			English	Article						hen oviduct uterus; mesotocin receptor; receptor binding affinity; receptor binding capacity; oviposition	ARGININE VASOTOCIN RECEPTOR; LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; SHELL GLAND; PLASMA	[I-125]mesotocin (MT) binding of membrane fractions of the oviduct uterus in laying hens and nonlaying hens was measured by the use of radioligand binding assay to elucidate the presence of MT receptor in the uterine tissue, and whether the binding to the receptor changes before and after oviposition. The uterine tissue of the hen was found to contain a specific [ 125I] MT binding component having properties of MT receptor (i.e., binding specificity, saturable binding, high affinity, and limited capacity). The equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) was 0.46 +/- 0.05 nM((x) over bar +/- SEM; n = 4) in laying hens holding a hard-shelled egg in the uterus (shell gland) and 0.78 +/- 0.02 nM(n = 4) in nonlaying hens. The maximum binding capacity (Bmax) was 0.28 +/- 0.03 pmol/mg of protein (n = 4) in laying hens and 0.19 +/- 0.01 pmol/mg of protein (n = 4) in nonlaying hens. The K-d value of the laying hens varied from 0.37 to 0.91 nM during an oviposition cycle showing a decrease 30 min before oviposition and an increase 4 h after oviposition. The Bmax value also varied from 0.15 to 0.38 pmol/mg of protein showing an increase 3 h before oviposition, a decrease 30 min before oviposition, and an increase 4 h after oviposition. In the nonlaying hen, both values were almost constant during a 24-h day. The changes in the binding affinity and capacity of MT receptor of the uterus may be related to oviposition in the hen.

Our results indicate that the amino acids Asp 176 in the third transmembrane domain (TMD), Glu237 in TMD IV, and Ser258 in TMD V Of alpha(1d)-AR were directly involved in prazosin and tamsulosin binding. The Asp176Ala mutant did not exhibit any affinity for [H-3]prazosin and neither did it show agonist-stimulated inositol phosphates (IP) formation. On the other hand, the Glu237Ala and Ser258Ala mutant alpha(1d)-AR showed increased binding affinity for [H-3]prazosin. Competition binding experiments showed that prazosin affinity had increased to 5-fold and 3-fold in the Glu237Ala and Ser258Ala mutants, respectively, versus wild-type; and tamsulosin affinity only increased in the Ser258Ala mutant (2-fold vs wild-type). It seems that these two residues constrain the receptor by interaction with other residues and this disruption of the interaction increased the receptor's binding affinity towards antagonists. However, the Glu237Ala and Ser258Ala mutant receptors retained the ability to stimulate the formation of myo-[H-3]inositol but had activities lower than that of the wild-type receptor. The present results provide direct evidence that these amino acid residues are responsible for the interactions between alpha(1d)-AR and the radioligand [H-3]prazosin as well as tamsulosin.

Using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET), we investigated the oligomeric assembly of the CRLR-RAMP1 signaling complex in living cells. As for their wild-type counterparts, fusion proteins linking CRLR and RAMP1 to the energy donor Renilla luciferase (Rluc) and energy acceptor green fluorescent protein (GFP) reach the cell surface only upon coexpression of CRLR and RAMP1. Radioligand binding and cAMP production assays also confirmed that the fusion proteins retained normal functional properties. BRET titration experiments revealed that CRLR and RAMP1 associate selectively to form heterodimers. This association was preserved for a mutated RAMP1 that cannot reach the cell surface, even in the presence of CRLR, indicating that the deficient targeting resulted from the altered conformation of the complex rather than a lack of heterodimerization. BRET analysis also showed that, in addition to associate with one another, both CRLR and RAMP1 can form homodimers. The homodimerization of the coreceptor was further confirmed by the ability of RAMP1 to prevent cell surface targeting of a truncated RAMP1 that normally exhibits receptor-independent plasma membrane delivery. Although the role of such dimerization remains unknown, BRET experiments clearly demonstrated that CRLR can engage signaling partners, such as G proteins and beta-arrestin, following CGRP stimulation, only in the presence of RAMP1. In addition to shed new light on the CRLR-RAMP1 signaling complex, the BRET assays developed herein offer new biosensors for probing CGRP receptor activity.

Swiss Webster mice (n = 24) were exposed to EtOH vapors for 72 h. Mice were sacrificed after 72 h following EtOH exposure (n = 12) and 24 h after its withdrawal (n = 12). Radioligand binding assays were performed to measure the density of CB1 receptor and CB1 receptor agonist-stimulated [S-35]GTP gamma S binding in crude synaptic membranes isolated from the cortex, hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum. The density of CB, receptor was significantly decreased (31-39%) in all the brain regions when compared to the control group. The CB1 receptor-stimulated G(i/o) protein activation was also found to be decreased (29-40%) in these brain regions of EtOH exposed mice. Recovery of the CB1 receptor density, in addition to, the CB1 receptor-mediated G-protein activation was observed after 24 h withdrawal from EtOH. The levels of cortical anandamide, which was significantly increased (147%) by EtOH exposure, returned to basal levels after 24 h of withdrawal from EtOH exposure. A significant reduction (21%) in the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase was found in the cortex of EtOH administered mice. Taken together, the neuroadaptation in the EC system may have a potential role in development of tolerance and dependence to EtOH. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The hypothesis of this study is that chronic hypobaric hypoxia may also induce acute hypoxia tolerance. We used intracellular recording in slices from rats exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia (exposed) and control to investigate the effects of chronic hypobaric hypoxia on the physiology of locus coeruleus (LC) including neuronal excitability. The results showed 35.7% reduced spontaneous firing rate and no change for membrane potential and input resistance in exposed neurons. In response to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor (A2R) agonist clonidine, both the hyperpolarizing potency and efficacy were increased indicated by a decreased EC50 (control: 30.9 nM and exposed: 19.7 nM) and a 50.5% increase in maximum hyperpolarized potential, respectively. A2R binding sites were also increased 21% in exposed neurons measured by radioligand [H-3]rauwolscine binding assay. When treated with acute N-2-hypoxia, the cell survival time (ST) was longer in exposed neurons, suggesting that a tolerance was induced. in addition, the ST for both groups of LC neurons was decreased by the A2R antagonist yohimbine and increased by the glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid but not by MK-801; the decreased percentage of ST by yohimbine was larger and the increased percentage by kynurenic acid was smaller in exposed neurons. The results suggested that up-regulation of A2R and altered non-NMDA glutamate receptor function induced by chronic hypobaric hypoxia may underlie, in part, the decreased LC neuronal excitability and acute hypoxia tolerance.

The PET tracers used for the study were the serotonin receptor antagonist WAY-100635 and two potential tracer analogues. The sensitivity permitted the substrates to be directly collected from PET radiolabelling batches. containing very low amounts of substance (0.3-7 mu g), for subsequent metabolic stability incubations. Sample preparation was minimal, with addition of internal standard, acetonitrile and a fast centrifugation step, as a result of the low protein concentration of the microsome solutions. Linearity (R-2 >= 0.99), precision (inter-assay R.S.D. < 7%) and accuracy (bias <= 8%) for the tested concentration range 0.5-5nM proved to be well within accepted limits. No significant differences in metabolic rates were detected using substrates from cold (non-labelling) chemistry syntheses and PET labelling batches, indicating the validity of using substrates from the latter Source. A para-methoxy-benzamide analogue (WO-WAY) displayed a significantly lower rate of metabolism compared to WAY-100635, whereas a para-iodo-benzamide analogue was more susceptible to metabolic transformation. LC-MS/MS Analysis of formed metabolites from WAY-100635 and MeO-WAY suggested similar metabolic pathways, with hydroxylation, demethylation and dearylation reactions. The main metabolic route in humans, amide hydrolysis, was not observed with the rat liver microsome assay. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

For the regioselective synthesis of etoxadrol homologues, the regioisomeric 4-azidobutanediols (+/-)-9 and (+/-)-14 were employed. A synthesis of the enantiomerically pure azidobutanediols (S)-, (R)-9 and (S)-, (R)-14 was developed and the homochiral building blocks were used for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure etoxadrol and dexoxadrol homologues. The affinity of the racemic and enantiomerically pure primary amines toward the phencyclidine binding site of the NMDA receptor was investigated in receptor binding studies with tritium labeled [H-3]-(+)-MK-801 as radioligand. Benzaldehyde derivatives (+/-)-12a, (+/-)-13a, and (+/-)-16a bearing a proton at the acetalic position do not interact significantly with the NMDA receptor. An enantioselective NMDA receptor binding was observed for the trans-configured 2-(2-ethyl-2-phenyl-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl)ethanamine 13b, the (2-ethyl-2-phenyl-1,3-dioxan-4-yl)methanamine 16b, and the (2,2-diphenyl-1,3-dioxan-4-yl)methanamine 16c. The NMDA receptor affinity of these compounds resides almost exclusively in the (S)-configured enantiomers (2S,4S)-13b, (2S,4S)-16b, and (4S)-16c. The lowest K-i-value in this series was found for the (2S,4S)-configured 1,3-dioxolane (2S,4S)-13b (K-i = 69 nM), which is in the range of the Ki-value of the lead compounds etoxadrol and dexoxadrol, indicating that the 2-aminoethyl and the piperidin-2-yl substituents lead to similar NMDA receptor interactions.

A recently developed scintillation proximity (SPA)-based assay for high-throughput screening (HTS) of compound libraries was used to identify novel estrogen receptor ligands that might have ER subtype selective binding activity. Radioligand binding was determined in a multi-detector scintillation counter designed for microtitration plates. Equilibrium binding experiments and kinetic competition tests were performed with [H-3]-estradiol and human ER alpha and ER beta receptors. A library of 6,000 structurally diverse compounds was screened. From this, several novel ligands were identified that showed pronounced subtype-selective differences in ligand binding for ER alpha and ER beta. The observed equilibrium dissociation constant (K-d) for the binding of [H-3]estradiol to ER alpha and ER beta receptors were approximately 0.25 and 0.64 nM, respectively. When 17 beta-estradiol, raloxifene and daidzein were tested for binding affinity to ER alpha in a competition assay, the IC50 values were 0.34, 1.31, and 75.6 nM, respectively. When tested for binding affinity to ERP, the IC50 values were 1.05, 11.4, and 10.6 nM, respectively. The results obtained show that the methodology is valid in comparison to previously published data regarding estradiol and other standard compounds (raloxifene and daidzein) binding characteristics of estrogen receptors. The assay is also well suited to applied research as a too] in HTS of compound libraries in the search of ER ligands. Several novel active compounds were identified and selected as potent ER subtype ligands. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Assays that link transcription of a detectable reporter to promoters that are activated by such signaling cascades are highly sensitive and allow screening for compounds that either activate or inactivate a GPCR of interest. This study describes the development and performance of an antagonistic screen on the human gonadotropin releasing hormone receptor ( GnRH- R). Compounds ( 245,000) were tested in a high- throughput screen using a Chinese hamster ovary cell line stably expressing the human GnRH- R and the Ca2+ sensitive reporter nuclear factor activated in T-cells/ activator protein-1-beta- lactamase. In total, 4,160 active compounds were identified. Colored and toxic compounds, as well as dust and compound aggregates, have been depicted as artifacts. To deselect non- target hits, several follow- up assays, including luminescent and fluorescent Ca2+ mobilization assays and radioligand binding, were developed for the GnRH- R. These assays were validated using peptide and low- molecular- weight GnRH- R reference compounds before hits from screening were also profiled in these assays. For several reference compounds the use of different assay technologies resulted in a poor correlation of potency values. In conclusion, beta- lactamase as a primary high- throughput screening assay is a powerful complementation to other screening technologies. The beta- lactamase technology has several advantages, including lack of cell lysis and ratiometric read- out, which augments assay robustness. Based on technology comparison, it is not adequate to assume that the same hits would be found regardless of which assay technology is used.

Similarly, at P2Y(2) and P2Y(4) receptors, nucleotides constrained in the (N) conformation interact equipolently with the corresponding ribosides. We now have synthesized and examined as P2Y receptor ligands nucleotide analogues substituted with two novel ring systems: (1) a (N) locked-carbocyclic (cLNA) derivative containing the oxabicyclo[2-2.1]heptane ring system and (2) L-alpha-threofuranosyl derivatives. We have also compared potencies and preferred conformations of these nucleotides with the known anhydrohexitol-containing P2Y(1) receptor antagonist MRS2283. A cLNA bisphosphate derivative MRS2584 21 displayed a K-i value of 22.5 nM in binding to the human P2Y 1 receptor, and antagonized the stimulation of PLC by the potent P2Y, receptor agonist 2-methylthio-ADP (30 nM) with an IC50 of 650 nM. The parent cLNA nucleoside bound only weakly to an adenosine receptor (A(3)) Thus, this ring system afforded some P2Y receptor selectivity. A L-a-threofuranosyl bisphosphate derivative 9 displayed an IC50 of 15.3 muM for inhibition of 2-methylthio-ADP-stimulated PLC activity. L-alpha-Threofuranosyl-UTP 13 was a P2Y receptor agonist with a preference for P2Y(2) (EC50 = 9.9 muM) versus P2Y(4) receptors. The P2Y(1) receptor binding modes, including rotational angles, were estimated using molecular modeling and receptor docking. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Radioligand binding studies have shown their presence in the neurons of the limbic system, a structure involved in mood control and subtle regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Structures of the limbic system are also rich in dopaminergic innervation. It has been hypothesized that glucocorticoids may be important in causing and perpetuating depression. Our previous study has demonstrated that dexamethasone decreases the locomotor activity of mice and counteracts the hyperactivity induced by agonists of dopamine receptors. The aim of the present study was to find the possible mechanism responsible for these behavioral effects of dexamethasone. So we sought to examine the influence of chronic dexamethasone treatment on selective radio-ligand binding to dopamine D-1 ([H-3]SCH 23390) and D-2 ([3H]spiperone) receptors in the brain of mice. The male Albino Swiss mice received dexamethasone (4, 8 or 16 mg/kg/day) for 14 days. The striatum and limbic system structures were isolated and the binding procedure was performed 3.5 or 48 h after the last injection. It was shown that 3.5 h after the last dose of dexamethasone (4 mg/kg/day), specific D-2 receptor binding was statistically significantly increased (by 64%) in the limbic system. On the contrary, the tendency to the reduction of specific D-2 receptor binding was observed in the striatum. Dexamethasone treatment did not influence the specific binding to D-1 receptors in any structure of the brain.

Although well known for modulatory effects on GABA(A), NMDA, and or, receptors, studies in both CNS and peripheral target cells suggest that DHEA also may exert genomic effects via the androgen receptor (AR). The current study tested the hypothesis that DHEA was capable of producing androgenic effects in the CNS by assaying its ability to induce three characteristic effects of an androgenic compound. These included the ability to upregulate neural AR protein level in mouse brain and immortalized GT1-7 hypothalamic cells, the capacity to induce transcriptional activity through AR in CV-1 cells transfected with an MMTV-ARE-CAT reporter, and competition for recombinant AR binding in a radioligand binding assay. The results showed that DHEA treatment significantly augmented AR both in vivo and in vitro, and that this effect was not blocked by trilostane (TRIL), a known 3(-beta)hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3beta-HSD) inhibitor. DHEA also promoted AR-mediated CAT reporter expression and competed with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) for binding to recombinant AR in a cell-free system. These data indicate that DHEA possesses intrinsic androgenic activity that is potentially independent of metabolic conversion to other androgens, and that it can affect gene function through the AR. In combination with its modulation of neurotransmitter receptors at the cell membrane level, the findings suggest that the mechanism of action of DHEA in the brain can involve a "crosstalk" cellular signaling system that involves both nongenomic and genomic components.

In the present study we compared the pharmacological characteristics of a new 5-HT2 antagonist sarpogrelate and its active metabolite M-1 with those of ketanserin on human recombinant alpha(1)-AR subtypes. In the binding study, sarpogrelate, M-1 and ketanserin produced concentration-dependent inhibition of H-3-prazosin binding to alpha(1)-ARs. Among the three drugs, ketanserin showed the highest affinity for alpha(1a)-, alpha(1b)- and alpha(1d)-ARs (pKi 8.0, 8.3 and 7.6, respectively). Sarpogrelate had a relatively low affinity for the three subtypes (6.3, 6.4 and 6.3, respectively) and M-1 showed medium affinity (7.1, 7.1 and 6.1, respectively). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing each alpha(1)-AR subtype showed concentration-dependent inositol phosphate (IP) accumulation in response to phenylephrine. The concentration response curves were shifted to the right by three drugs, and the pKb values were close to the pKi values in the binding study. In addition to these effects, sarpogrelate and M-1, but not ketanserin produced an increase in the basal IP level of alpha(1d)-expressed CHO cells, although the increase was less than that of phenylephrine. The present results indicate that sarpogrelate and M-1 have antagonistic activity to the three alpha(1)-AR subtypes, but their affinities are significantly lower than those of ketanserin.

These TPalpha receptors were coupled to phospholipase C (PLC) and, thus, promoted phosphoinositide (PI) turnover. TP receptor agonists yielded the following potencies (EC(50)s) in the PI turnover assays: I-BOP = 8.2 +/- 1.1 nM, carbocyclic TA(2) = 87.5 +/- 25.3 nM; U-44069 = 1. 16 +/- 0.32 muM; U-46619 = 1.2 +/- 0.2 muM (n = 4-17). Agonists selective for other prostanoid receptor subtypes (e.g., fluprostenol and sulprostone) were inactive. The agonist effects of U-44619 and I-BOP were potently blocked, in an apparent non-competitive manner (k(i) = 53.9 +/- 12 nM; pA(2)s = 7.6-7.8; pK(b)S = 7.38), by the TP receptor-selective antagonist, SQ29,548, but were unaffected by other prostanoid receptor antagonists (e.g., AH6809, AL-8810). The PLC inhibitor (U73122) inhibited U-46619-induced PI turnover (IC50 = 4.3 +/- 0.6 muM). The functional potencies of the compounds stimulating or inhibiting the TP receptor-mediated PI turnover in the NPE cells correlated well with the TP receptor binding affinities of these compounds at human platelet TP receptors (r = 0.98). These studies have shown the presence of the mRNA for and the expression of functional TP, receptors coupled to PLC in human NPE cells. The TPalpha receptors on NPE cells may be responsible for inhibiting aqueous humor production and may help explain the intraocular pressure-lowering effects of certain TP agonists.

In contrast, IL-1RII functions as a decoy receptor without participating in IL-1 signalling. Brain astrocytes are cellular targets of IL-1 and play a pivotal role in brain responses to inflammation. The regulation of IL-1 receptors on astrocytes by anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10 has not been studied, despite its importance for understanding the way these cells respond to IL-1. Using RT-PCR, we first showed that the expression of IL-1RI and IL-1RII, but not IL-1RacP, mRNAs are up-regulated by IL-1 beta in a time-dependent manner. Using a radioligand binding technique, we then showed that astrocytes display an equivalent number of IL-1RI and IL-1RII. IL-1 beta decreases the number of IL-1RI binding sites, whereas it increases those of IL-1RII. IL-4 and IL-10 both up-regulate IL-1RII IL-1 beta -induced, but only IL-4 does so for IL-1RI. At the protein level, IL-4 and IL-10 dramatically reverse the ability of IL-1 beta to inhibit expression of IL-1RI but neither affects the ability of IL-1 beta to enhance the number of IL-1RII. Collectively, these results establish the existence of receptor cross-talk between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines on a critical type of cell that regulates inflammatory events in the brain.

We have previously shown that chronic (18 h) but not acute (30 min or 2 h) pretreatment with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol resulted in decreased adenylyl cyclase activity in response to GTP, isoproterenol, or forskolin via a pathway blocked by the protein kinase C inhibitor staurosporine. The present study was designed to determine if carbachol-induced decreases in adenylyl cyclase activity were due to regulatory events at the level of either G(s)alpha or adenylyl cyclase. Detergent-solubilized G(s)alpha from control or carbachol-pretreated bovine airway smooth muscle had similar adenylyl cyclase activity in response to either NaF or guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTP gamma S) when reconstituted into S49 cyc(-) membranes that lack endogenous G(s)alpha (carbachol pretreated: GTP gamma S, 93 +/- 13% of control; NaF/AlCl3, 99 +/- 8.6% of control; n = 4). Exogenous G(s)alpha solubilized from red blood cells failed to restore normal adenylyl cyclase activity when reconstituted into carbachol-pretreated bovine airway smooth muscle (carbachol pretreated: GTP, 36 +/- 10% of control; NaF/AlCl3, 54 +/- 11% of control; n = 4). [H-3]forskolin radioligand saturation binding assays revealed a decreased quantity of total adenylyl cyclase protein after carbachol pretreatment (maximal binding: 152 +/- 40 and 107 +/- 31 fmol/mg protein in control and carbachol-pretreated airway smooth muscle, respectively). These results suggest that chronic activation of muscarinic receptors downregulates the expression of adenylyl cyclase protein in bovine airway smooth muscle.

Amplification reactions were performed to extend the 5' and 3' ends of this cDNA, followed by end-to-end PCR and conventional cloning. The resultant 5131-basepair molecule, designated imidazoline receptor-antisera-selected (IRAS) cDNA, was shown to encode a 1504-amino acid protein (IRAS-1). No relation exists between the amino acid sequence of IRAS-1 and proteins known to bind imidazolines (e.g., it is not an alpha(2)-adrenoceptor or monoamine oxidase subtype). However, certain sequences within IRAS-1 are consistent with signaling motifs found in cytokine receptors, as previously suggested for an IR1. An acidic region in IRAS-1 having an amino acid sequence nearly identical to that of ryanodine receptors led to the demonstration that ruthenium red, a dye that binds the acidic region in ryanodine receptors, also stained IRAS-1 as a 167-kD band on SDS gels and inhibited radioligand binding of native I-1 sites in untransfected PC-12 cells (a source of authentic I1 binding sites). Two epitope-selective antisera were also generated against IRAS-1, and both reacted with the same 167-kD band on Western blots. In a host-cell-specific manner, transfection of IRAS cDNA into Chinese hamster ovary cells led to high-affinity I1 binding sites by criteria of nanomolar affinity for moxonidine and rilmenidine. Thus, IRAS-1 is the first protein discovered with characteristics of an IR1.

Assessing the potential anti-neuroinflammatory effect of minocycline in chronic low back pain: Protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial	CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article						Neuroinflammation; Chronic pain; Low back pain; Minocycline; Positron emission tomography; 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO)	PROTEIN 18 KDA; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; GLIAL ACTIVATION; PET RADIOLIGAND; BINDING-SITES; BRAIN; TSPO; HEALTH; SCALE; AMITRIPTYLINE	Introduction: Both preclinical studies, and more recent clinical imaging studies, suggest that glia-mediated neuroinflammation may be implicated in chronic pain, and therefore might be a potential treatment target. However, it is currently unknown whether modulating neuroinflammation effectively alleviates pain in humans. This trial tests the hypothesis that minocycline, an FDA-approved tetracycline antibiotic and effective glial cell inhibitor in animals, reduces neuroinflammation and may reduce pain symptoms in humans with chronic low back pain.Methods and analysis: This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Subjects, aged 18-75, with a confirmed diagnosis of chronic (>= six months) low back pain (cLBP) and a self-reported pain rating of at least four out of ten (for at least half of the days during an average week) are enrolled via written, informed consent. Eligible subjects are randomized to receive a 14-day course of either active drug (minocycline) or placebo. Before and after treatment, subjects are scanned with integrated Positron Emission Tomography/ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (PET/MRI) using [11C]PBR28, a second-generation radiotracer for the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is highly expressed in glial cells and thus a putative marker of neuro-inflammation. Pain levels are evaluated via daily surveys, collected seven days prior to the start of medication, and throughout the 14 days of treatment. General linear models will be used to assess pain levels and determine the treatment effect on brain (and spinal cord) TSPO signal.Trial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03106740).

Currently, most of the pharmacological studies were performed using [H-3]melatonin and 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin (2-[I-125]-MLT) radioligands. Recently, NanoLuc-based bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (NanoBRET) monitoring competitive binding between fluorescent tracers and unmodified test compounds has emerged as a sensitive, nonradioactive alternative for quantifying GPCR ligand engagement on the surface of living cells in equilibrium and real time. However, developing such assays for the two melatonin receptors depends on the availability of fluorescent tracers, which has been challenging predominantly owing to their narrow ligand entry channel and small ligand binding pocket. Here, we generated a set of melatonergic fluorescent tracers and used NanoBRET to evaluate their engagement with MT1 and MT2 receptors that are genetically fused to an N-terminal luminogenic HiBiT-peptide. We identified several nonselective and subtype-selective tracers. Among the selective tracers, PBI-8238 exhibited high nanomolar affinity to MT1, and PBI-8192 exhibited low nanomolar affinity to MT2. The pharmacological profiles of both tracers were in good agreement with those obtained with the current standard 2-[I-125]-MLT radioligand. Molecular docking and mutagenesis studies suggested the binding mode of PBI-8192 in MT2 and its selectivity over MT1. In conclusion, we describe the development of the first nonradioactive, real-time binding assays for melatonin receptors expressed at the cell surface of living cells that are likely to accelerate drug discovery for melatonin receptors.

Fluorescent A<sub>2A</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> adenosine receptor antagonists as flow cytometry probes	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Adenosine receptor; Antagonist; Receptor binding; Fluorescent ligands; Drug discovery; Flow cytometry	ACCURATE DOCKING; GLIDE; PROTEIN; DERIVATIVES; A(2B); CELL	Adenosine receptor (AR) ligands are being developed for metabolic, cardiovascular, neurological, and inflammatory diseases and cancer. The ease of drug discovery is contingent on the availability of pharmacological tools. Fluorescent antagonist ligands for the human A(2A) and A(3) ARs were synthesized using two validated pharmacophores, 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthine and triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-yl)amine, which were coupled to eight reporter fluorophores: AlexaFluor, JaneliaFluor (JF), cyanine, and near infrared (NIR) dyes. The conjugates were first screened using radioligand binding in HEK293 cells expressing one of the three AR subtypes. The highest affinities at A(2A)AR were K-i 144-316 nM for 10, 12, and 19, and at A(3)AR affinity of K-i 21.6 nM for 19. Specific binding of JF646 conjugate MRS7774 12 to the HEK293 cell surface A(2A)AR was imaged using confocal microscopy. Compound 19 MRS7535, a triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-yl)amine containing a Sulfo-Cy7 NIR dye, was suitable for A(3)AR characterization in whole cells by flow cytometry (K-d 11.8 nM), and its bitopic interaction mode with an A(3)AR homology model was predicted. Given its affinity and selectivity (11-fold vs. A(2A)AR, similar to 50-fold vs. A(1)AR and A(2B)AR) and a good specific-to-nonspecific binding ratio, 19 could be useful for live cell or potentially a diagnostic in vivo NIR imaging tool and/or therapy targeting the A(3)AR.

The strong antimicrobial properties of AgNPs have led to their use in a wide range of medical and consumer products. Although the neurotoxicity of AgNPs has been confirmed, the molecular mechanisms have not been extensively studied, particularly in immature organisms. Based on information gained from previous in vitro studies, in the present work, we examine whether ionotropic NMDA glutamate receptors contribute to AgNP-induced neurotoxicity in an animal model of exposure. In brains of immature rats subjected to a low dose of AgNPs, we identified ultrastructural and molecular alterations in the postsynaptic region of synapses where NMDA receptors are localized as a multiprotein complex. We revealed decreased expression of several NMDA receptor complex-related proteins, such as GluN1 and GluN2B subunits, scaffolding proteins PSD95 and SynGAP, as well as neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). Elucidating the changes in NMDA receptor-mediated molecular mechanisms induced by AgNPs, we also identified downregulation of the GluN2B-PSD95-nNOS-cGMP signaling pathway which maintains LTP/LTD processes underlying learning and memory formation during development. This observation is accompanied by decreased density of NMDA receptors, as assessed by a radioligand binding assay. The observed effects are reversible over the post-exposure time. This investigation reveals that NMDA receptors in immature rats are a target of AgNPs, thereby indicating the potential health hazard for children and infants resulting from the extensive use of products containing AgNPs.

In this study, we developed a CD46-targeted PET radiopharmaceutical, [Zr-89]DFO-YS5, and evaluated its performance for immunoPET imaging in murine prostate cancer models. Experimental Design: [Zr-89]DFO-YS5 was prepared and its in vitro binding affinity for CD46 was measured. ImmunoPET imaging was conducted in male athymic nu/nu mice bearing DU145 [AR(-), CD46(+), prostate-specific membrane antigen-negative (PSMA(-))] or 22Rv1 (AR(+), CD46(+), PSMA(+)) tumors, and in NOD/SCID gamma mice bearing patient-derived adenocarcinoma xenograft, LTL-331, and neuroendocrine prostate cancers, LTL-331R and LTL-545. Results: [Zr-89]DFO-YS5 binds specifically to the CD46-positive human prostate cancer DU145 and 22Rv1 xenografts. In biodistribution studies, the tumor uptake of [Zr-89]DFO-YS5 was 13.3 +/- 3.9 and 11.2 +/- 2.5 %ID/g, respectively, in DU145 and 22Rv1 xenografts, 4 days postinjection. Notably, [Zr-89] DFO-YS5 demonstrated specific uptake in the PSMA- and AR-negative DU145 model. [Zr-89]DFO-YS5 also showed uptake in the patient-derived LTL-331 and -331R models, with particularly high uptake in the LTL-545 neuroendocrine prostate cancer tumors (18.8 +/- 5.3, 12.5 +/- 1.8, and 32 +/- 5.3 %ID/g in LTL-331, LTL-331R, and LTL-545, respectively, at 4 days postinjection). Conclusions: [Zr-89]DFO-YS5 is an excellent PET imaging agent across a panel of prostate cancer models, including in both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine prostate cancer, both cell line- and patient-derived xenografts, and both PSMA-positive and -negative tumors. It demonstrates potential for clinical translation as an imaging agent, theranostic platform, and companion biomarker in prostate cancer.

HELLENIC JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; Visceral metastasis; Lu-177-PSMA; Progression-free survival	PROSTATE-CANCER; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; CLINICAL-TRIALS; SURVIVAL; DISEASE; RECOMMENDATIONS; DESIGN; LIVER	Objective: We analyzed the clinical outcome of lutetium-177 prostate-specific membrane antigen (Lu-177-PSMA) in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients with visceral metastasis. Subjects and Methods: Ten patients of mCRPC with visceral metastasis were enrolled for one cycle of Lu-177-PSMA therapy. Number of efficacy and safety parameters, e.g., prostate-specific antigen (PSA), visual analog scale (VAS) and analgesic quantification scale (AQS), hemoglobin (Hb), total leukocytes counts (TLC), platelets, creatinine, & total bilirubin, were assessed and compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The progression-free survival (PFS) curve was computed by the Kaplan-Meier method.The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was also plotted for Lu-177-PSMA dose. P <= 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Liver (80%), lung (30%), adrenal (10%), and peritoneum (10%) were the sites of visceral metastasis in our study. On PSA response assessment, 10%, 60%, and 30% of the patients had partial response, stable disease, and progressive disease, respectively. Forty percent of the patients had improvement in the VAS, while 50% had improvement in the AQS score. Median PFS was 24 weeks in our study. A cut-off of 4.88GBq of Lu-177-PSMA was the best-predicted progression with 66.67% sensitivity and 100% specificity on ROC analysis. Thirty percent of the patients showed grade 3 anemia. No other significant toxicity was seen. Conclusion: Lutetium-177-PSMA was a reasonable palliative treatment option with limited toxicity for these end-stage mCRPC patients with visceral metastasis with adequate PSA stabilization. A synergistic drug amalgamation may be an ideal way to boost the outcome in the future.

Binding of the synaptic vesicle radiotracer [<SUP>11</SUP>C]UCB-J is unchanged during functional brain activation using a visual stimulation task	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						[C-11]UCB-J; positron emission tomography; SV2A; synaptic density; visual activation	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; TEST-RETEST; PET; RELEASE; CORTEX; CONSUMPTION; VALIDATION; ATTENTION; RESPONSES	The positron emission tomography radioligand [C-11]UCB-J binds to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A (SV2A), a regulator of vesicle release. Increased neuronal firing could potentially affect tracer concentrations if binding site availability is altered during vesicle exocytosis. This study assessed whether physiological brain activation induces changes in [C-11]UCB-J tissue influx (K-1), volume of distribution (V-T), or binding potential (BPND). Healthy volunteers (n = 7) underwent 60-min [C-11]UCB-J PET scans at baseline and during intermittent presentation of 8-Hz checkerboard visual stimulation. Sensitivity to intermittent changes in kinetic parameters was assessed in simulations, and visual stimulation was repeated using functional magnetic resonance imaging to characterize neural responses.V-T andK(1)were determined using the one-tissue compartment model andBP(ND)using the simplified reference tissue model. In primary visual cortex,K(1)increased 34.3 +/- 15.5% (p = 0.001) during stimulation, with no change in other regions (ps > 0.12).K(1)change was correlated with fMRI BOLD response (r = 0.77,p = 0.043). There was no change inV(T)(-3.9 +/- 8.8%,p = 0.33) orBP(ND)(-0.2 +/- 9.6%,p = 0.94) in visual cortex nor other regions (ps > 0.19). Therefore, despite robust increases in regional tracer influx due to blood flow increases, binding measures were unchanged during stimulation. [C-11]UCB-JV(T)andBP(ND)are likely to be stable in vivo measures of synaptic density.

Imaging of sigma R-1 in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) could serve as a noninvasively tool for enhancing the understanding of the disease's pathophysiology. Moreover, sigma R-1 PET tracers can be used for target validation and quantification in diagnosis. Herein, we describe the radiosynthesis, in vivo PET/CT imaging of novel sigma R-1 C-11-labeled radioligands based on 6-hydroxypyridazinone, [ C-11]HCC0923 and [C-11]HCC0929. Two radioligands have high affinities to sigma R-1, with good selectivity. In mice PET/CT imaging, both radioligands showed appropriate kinetics and distributions. Additionally, the specific interactions of two radioligands were reduced by compounds 13 and 15 (self-blocking). Of the two, [C-11]HCC0929 was further investigated in positive ligands blocking studies, using classic o i R agonist SA 4503 and sigma R-1 antagonist PD 144418. Both sigma R-1 ligands could extensively decreased the uptake of [ 11 C]HCC0929 in mice brain. Besides, the biodistribution of major brain regions and organs of mice were determined in vivo. These studies demonstrated that two radioligands, especially [C-11]HCC0929, possessed ideal imaging properties and might be valuable tools for non-invasive quantification of sigma R-1 in brain.

The aim of this study was to prepare a new derivative of 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine (MPP) as a main chemical structure of 5HT(1A) receptor antagonist with 3-carbon linker and radiolabeled by [Tc-99m][Tc(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+) precursor. Docking studies before chemical synthesis showed similar fashion of interaction for both WAY100635 (potent 5HT(1A) receptor antagonist) and new designed ligand, despite of addition of Tc-99m(CO)(3) group in the structure of new ligand. MPP-(CH2)(3)-N-3 was synthesized via three efficient and reliable chemical synthesis steps (more than 80% yield) then radiolabeled by addition of 2-ethynylpyridine and [Tc-99m][Tc(CO)(3)(H2O)(3)](+) precursor in one pot procedure (more than 95% radiochemical efficiency) through click chemistry method. After incubation, radiotracer was found stable in vitro up to 2 hours. Binding assays showed about 33% specific binding of radiotracer to the 5HT(1A) receptors. Brain biodistribution studies indicated (0.26 +/- 0.05)% ID/g hippocampus uptake at 30 minutes post injection, which its specificity was verified through blocking studies. These results suggested that new designed radioligand might serve as a potent SPECT imaging agent to estimate status of 5HT(1A) receptors.

Interaction between the two pathways is one of the most important issues in understanding the regulation of GPCRs. The present study investigated the regulatory effect of GRK2 and beta-arrestins on PKC activation. The roles of GRK2 and beta-arrestins in the functional regulation of PKC were assessed by determining their influence on PKC autophosphorylation and intracellular translocation. Radioligand binding assay was utilized to characterize intracellular trafficking of dopamine D2R, D3R, and beta(2) adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR). The subdomains involved in the mutual interactions among GRK2, beta-arrestin2, and PKC beta II were determined by in vitro binding assay. Various point mutants of key regulatory players were combined with knockdown cells of GRK2, beta-arrestins, and Mdm2 to functionally correlate the biochemical changes with functional outcomes. GRK2 and beta-arrestin2 mutually inhibited the PKC beta II autophosphorylation, a hallmark of PKG beta II activation. beta-Arrestin2 ubiquitination was required for the inhibitory activities of GRK2 as well as beta-arrestin2. Furthermore, GRK2 facilitated beta-arrestin2 ubiquitination, thus to enhance the inhibitory actions of beta-arrestin2 on PKC beta II activity. Aforementioned processes were also involved in the GRK2/beta-arrestin2-mediated inhibition of the D2R, D3R, and beta(2)AR endocytosis. The present study provides new insights into the intricate interactions between the homologous and heterologous GPCR regulation pathways. In addition, a novel regulatory role of GRK2 was proposed for the ubiquitination of beta-arrestin in the context of the PKC-mediated heterologous regulation of GPCRs.

[C-11]Sulpiride was injected to healthy male subjects in either tracer dose of [C-11]sulpiride (approximately 222 MBq) or with therapeutic dose of sulpiride (500 mg, peroral) 3 h before the injection in a crossover fashion. Whole-body positron emission tomography imaging demonstrated that [C-11]sulpiride accumulated exceedingly in the bladder, followed by liver, gall bladder, and kidney, respectively, at 30 min after the injection, whereas scarcely in the brain. Oral dose of sulpiride decreased the hepatic accumulation of the radioactivity by 60%. From in vitro experiments, we found that sulpiride is a substrate of hOCT1 (K-m 2.6 mu M), hOCT2 (K-m 68 mu M), hMATE1 (K-m 40 mu M), and hMATE2-K (K-m 60 mu M). Moreover, the uptake of sulpiride by human hepatocytes was diminished by tetraethylammonium, and saturable with K-m of 18 mu M. Oct1/2 double knockout mice and wild-type mice received Mate1 inhibitors (pyrimethamine/cimetidine) manifested reduced renal clearance of sulpiride, accompanied with its accumulation in the plasma. In conclusion, we found that sulpiride is a substrate of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K, and this suggests that [C-11]sulpiride would be a useful radioligand to investigate the organic cation transporters in humans.

Methods: In vitro studies of compound 1 were assessed by using a radioligand-binding assay (n = 3), a cyclic adenosine monophosphate assay (n = 3), a beta-arrestin assay (n = 3), an internalization assay (n = 3), and an immunohistochemistry (n = 8). In vivo studies of compound 1 were characterized using a tail-flick test (n = 5 to 6), tail-clip test (n = 7), von Frey hair test (n = 5), and charcoal meal test (n = 5). Results: Compound 1 elicited robust effects in mu-opioid (mean +/- SD; binding affinity: 15 +/- 2 nM; cyclic adenosine monophosphate assay: 24 +/- 6 nM), delta-opioid (82 +/- 7 nM; 1.9 +/- 0.1 mu M), and kappa-opioid (76 +/- 9 nM; 1.4 +/- 0.5 mu M) receptor-expressing cells. Compound 1 acts as a full agonist of beta-arrestin-2 recruitment in mu-opioid (1.1 +/- 0.3 mu M) and delta-opioid (9.7 +/- 1.9 mu M) receptor-expressing cells. Compound 1 caused less gastrointestinal dysfunction (charcoal meal test: morphine: 82 +/- 5%; compound 1: 42 +/- 5%) as well as better antinociception in mechanical pain hypersensitivity (tail-clip test: morphine: 10 +/- 3s; compound 1: 19 +/- 1 s) and in cancer-induced pain (von Frey hair test: morphine: 0.1 +/- 0.1 g; compound 1: 0.3 +/- 0.1 g) than morphine at equi-antinociceptive doses. Conclusions: Compound 1 produced antinociception with less gastrointestinal dysfunction than morphine.

Cerebral 5-HT release correlates with [<SUP>11</SUP>C]Cimbi36 PET measures of 5-HT2A receptor occupancy in the pig brain	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Positron emission tomography; 5-HT; brain imaging; kinetic modelling; neurosurgery	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; ANTIDEPRESSANT BINDING-SITES; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; IN-VIVO BINDING; EXTRACELLULAR SEROTONIN; FRONTAL-CORTEX; D-FENFLURAMINE; QUANTITATIVE MICRODIALYSIS; CONSCIOUS MONKEYS; H-3 PAROXETINE	Positron emission tomography (PET) can, when used with appropriate radioligands, non-invasively generate temporal and spatial information about acute changes in brain neurotransmitter systems. We for the first time evaluate the novel 5-HT2A receptor agonist PET radioligand, [C-11] Cimbi-36, for its sensitivity to detect changes in endogenous cerebral 5-HT levels, as induced by different pharmacological challenges. To enable a direct translation of PET imaging data to changes in brain 5-HT levels, we calibrated the [C-11] Cimbi-36 PET signal in the pig brain by simultaneous measurements of extracellular 5-HT levels with microdialysis and [C-11] Cimbi-36 PET after various acute interventions (saline, citalopram, citalopram + pindolol, fenfluramine). In a subset of pigs, para-chlorophenylalanine pretreatment was given to deplete cerebral 5-HT. The interventions increased the cerebral extracellular 5-HT levels to 2-11 times baseline, with fenfluramine being the most potent pharmacological enhancer of 5-HT release, and induced a varying degree of decline in [C-11] Cimbi-36 binding in the brain, consistent with the occupancy competition model. The observed correlation between changes in the extracellular 5-HT level in the pig brain and the 5-HT2A receptor occupancy indicates that [C-11] Cimbi-36 binding is sensitive to changes in endogenous 5-HT levels, although only detectable with PET when the 5-HT release is sufficiently high.

They also efficiently scavenge their chemokine ligands, thereby contributing to gradient maintenance and termination. ACKR3, also known as CXCR7, binds and degrades the constitutive chemokine CXCL12, which also binds the canonical receptor CXCR4, and CXCL11, which also binds CXCR3. Here we report comprehensive mutational analysis of the ACKR3 interaction with its chemokine ligands, using 30 substitution mutants. Readouts are radioligand binding competition, arrestin recruitment, and chemokine scavenging. Our results suggest different binding modes for both chemokines. CXCL11 depends on the ACKR3N terminus and some extracellular loop (ECL) positions for primary binding, ECL residues mediate secondary binding and arrestin recruitment potency. CXCL12 binding required key residues Asp-179(4.60) and Asp-275(6.58) (residue numbering follows the Ballesteros-Weinstein scheme), with no evident involvement of N-terminal residues, suggesting an uncommon mode of receptor engagement. Mutation of residues corresponding to CRS2 in CXCR4 (positions Ser-103(2.63) and Gln-301(7.39)) increased CXCL11 binding, but reduced CXCL12 affinity. Mutant Q301E(7.39) did not recruit arrestin. Mutant K118A(3.26) in ECL1 showed moderate baseline arrestin recruitment with ablation of ligand-induced responses. Substitutions that affected CXCL11 binding also diminished scavenging. However, detection of reduced CXCL12 scavenging by mutants with impaired CXCL12 affinity required drastically reduced receptor expression levels, suggesting that scavenging pathways can be saturated and that CXCL12 binding exceeds scavenging at higher receptor expression levels. Arrestin recruitment did not correlate with scavenging; although Q301E(7.39) degraded chemokines in the absence of arrestin, S103D(2.63) had reduced CXCL11 scavenging despite intact arrestin responses.

The imaging of their regional density with positron emission tomography (PET) could thus help in the exploration of the molecular basis of drug addiction. A fluorine-18 labeled D3 subtype selective radioligand would be beneficial for this purpose; however, as yet, there is no such tracer available. The three candidates [F-18]1, [F-18]2a and [F-18]2b were chosen for in vitro and in vivo characterization as radioligands suitable for selective PET imaging of the D3 receptor. Their evaluation included the analysis of radiometabolites and the assessment of non-specific binding by in vitro rat brain autoradiography. While [F-18]1 and [F-18]2a revealed high non-specific uptake in in vitro rat brain autoradiography, the D3 receptor density was successfully determined on rat brain sections (n = 4) with the candidate [F-18]2b offering a B-max of 20.38 +/- 2.67 pmol/g for the islands of Calleja, 19.54 +/- 1.85 pmol/g for the nucleus accumbens and 16.58 +/- 1.63 pmol/g for the caudate putamen. In PET imaging studies, the carboxamide 1 revealed low signal/background ratios in the rat brain and relatively low uptake in the pituitary gland, while the azocarboxamides [F-18]2a and [F-18]2b showed binding that was blockable by the D3 receptor ligand BP897 in the ventricular system and the pituitary gland in PET imaging studies in living rats.

Here, we report new data on the receptor pharmacology of GSK121498, in comparison to naltrexone, naloxone, 6-beta-naltrexol and nalmefene. To determine whether the novel opioid antagonist, GSK1521498, is an orthosteric or allosteric antagonist at the mu opioid receptor (MOPr) and whether it has neutral antagonist or inverse agonist properties. A combination of radioligand binding assays and [S-35]GTP gamma S binding assays was employed. GSK1521498 completely displaced [H-3]naloxone binding to MOPr and did not alter the rate of [H-3]naloxone dissociation from MOPr observations compatible with it binding to the orthosteric site on MOPr. GSK1521498 exhibited inverse agonism when MOPr was overexpressed but not when the level of MOPr expression was low. In parallel studies under conditions of high receptor expression density, naloxone, naltrexone, 6-beta-naltrexol and nalmefene exhibited partial agonism, not inverse agonism as has been reported previously for naloxone and naltrexone. In brain tissue from mice receiving a prolonged morphine pre-treatment, GSK1521498 exhibited slight inverse agonism. Differences between GSK1521498 and naltrexone in their effects on compulsive reward seeking are arguably linked to the more selective and complete MOPr antagonism of GSK1521498 versus the partial MOPr agonism of naltrexone. GSK1521498 is also pharmacologically differentiated by its inverse agonist efficacy at high levels of MOPr expression, but this may be less likely to contribute to behavioural differentiation at patho-physiological levels of expression.

In vitro competition binding assays showed that the fluoroalkoxy analogues with small substituents possessed high affinity towards sigma(1) receptors and subtype selectivity. Particularly for ligand 1'-((6-(2-fluoroethoxy) pyridin-3-yl)methyl)-3H-spiro[2-benzofuran-1,40-piperidine] (2), high sigma(1) receptor affinity (K-i = 2.30 nM) and high sigma(1)/sigma(2) subtype selectivity (142-fold) as well as high sigma(1)/VAChT selectivity (234-fold) were observed. [F-18](2) was synthesized using an efficient one-pot, two-step reaction method in a home-made automated synthesis module, with an overall isolated radiochemical yield of 8-10%, a radiochemical purity of higher than 99%, and specific activity of 56-78 GBq/mu mol. Biodistribution studies of [F-18](2) in ICR mice indicated high initial brain uptake and a relatively fast washout. Administration of haloperidol, compound 1 and different concentrations of SA4503 (3, 5, or 10 mu mol/kg) 5 min prior to injection of [F-18](2) significantly decreased the accumulation of radiotracer in organs known to contain sigma(1) receptors. Ex vivo autoradiography in Sprague-Dawley rats demonstrated high accumulation of radiotracer in brain areas with high expression of sigma(1) receptors. These encouraging results prove that [F-18](2) is a suitable candidate for sigma(1) receptor imaging with PET in humans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Michael			There is no correlation between glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression and protein binding in the brains of house sparrows (<i>Passer domesticus</i>)	GENERAL AND COMPARATIVE ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						Glucocorticoid receptor; Mineralocorticoid receptor; Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR; Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; TATA-box binding protein	BASE-LINE; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; CORTICOSTEROID RECEPTORS; GENE-EXPRESSION; RT-PCR; STRESS; QUANTIFICATION; RESPONSES; MEMBRANE; NORMALIZATION	The stress response represents an animal's attempt to cope with a noxious stimulus through a rapid release of corticosterone or cortisol (CORT) into the bloodstream, resulting in a suite of physiological and behavioral changes. These changes are mediated in large part through CORT's binding to two different intracellular receptors, the high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the lower-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR). We tested the hypothesis that GR and MR mRNA expression would correlate with functional protein expression in neuronal tissue of wild-caught house sparrows (Passer domesticus). To test this hypothesis, we performed a parallel procedure in which protein concentrations were quantified in one half of house sparrow brains (n = 16) using radioligand binding assays, and mRNA levels were quantified in the other brain half using reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Two reference genes, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and TATA-box binding protein (TBP), were used for relative quantification of GR and MR mRNA. Quantifications showed that these two reference genes were not correlated with each other. Furthermore, there was no correlation between mRNA and protein levels for GR or MR using either reference gene, suggesting that regulation of mRNA and protein levels for MR and GR is not tightly linked. This study provides insight into the importance of regulatory steps between mRNA expression and the creation and stability of a functional protein. The overall conclusion is that mRNA expression cannot be used as a proxy for GR or MR binding in house sparrows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We have performed similar studies in rat brain regions with selective 5-HT2A (M100907) and 5-HT2C (SB242084) antagonists together with ketanserin and mesulergine. The effect of GTP analogues on antagonist competition was also studied. Increasing concentrations of Gpp(NH)p or GTP gamma S resulted in a maximal inhibition of [I-125](+/-)DOI-specific binding of approximately 50 %. M100907 competed biphasically in all regions. In the presence of 100 mu M Gpp(NH)p, M100907 still displaced biphasically the remaining [I-125](+/-)DOI binding. Ketanserin showed biphasic curves in some regions and monophasic curves in others. In the latter, Gpp(NH)p evidenced an additional high-affinity site. SB242084 competed biphasically in brainstem nuclei and monophasically in the other regions. In most areas, SB242084 affinities were not notably altered by Gpp(NH)p. Mesulergine competed monophasically in all regions without alteration by Gpp(NH)p. These results conform with the extended ternary complex model of receptor action: receptor exists as an equilibrium of multiple conformations, i.e. ground (R), partly activated (R*) and activated G-protein-coupled (R*G) conformation/s. Thus, [I-125](+/-)DOI would label multiple conformations of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in rat brain, and M100907 and ketanserin would recognise these conformations with different affinities.

Oral Terbutaline in Replacement for Intravenous Dopamine in a Patient with End-Stage Heart Failure	ANNALS OF PHARMACOTHERAPY			English	Article							ANTAGONIST TREATMENT; BETA-2-ADRENOCEPTORS; ADRENOCEPTORS	OBJECTIVE: To describe the replacement of intravenous dopamine with oral terbutaline in a patient with American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association stage D heart failure (HF). CASE SUMMARY: A 54-year-old male was admitted for acute decompensated HF, which was successfully managed by aggressive diuresis and intravenous dopamine 3 mu g/kg/min. Multiple attempts to taper dopamine to discontinuation led to hypotension and bradycardia. In view of his hemodynamic response to dopamine weaning, oral terbutaline 5 mg every 8 hours was recommended to replace intravenous dopamine. With the addition of terbutaline, the patient continued to be hemodynamically stable, and dopamine was successfully discontinued, allowing the patient to be discharged home. DISCUSSION: Radioligand binding studies have shown that both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors exist in human myocardium. Terbutaline is a beta-2 agonist available in oral dosage form. Small single-dose studies have demonstrated that terbutaline improved cardiac output and increased heart rate, either directly by its positive inotropic effect or indirectly by its pulmonary vasodilatory effect. There are no long-term efficacy and safety data on the use of oral terbutaline in the management of HF. However, in our case, in which symptomatic improvement and comfort measure were our main goals of therapy, the use of oral terbutaline allowed us to successfully discontinue dopamine and maintain hemodynamic stability. CONCLUSIONS: The use of oral terbutaline to replace intravenous dopamine led to a successful maintenance of hemodynamic stability in a patient with advanced stage HF. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports describing the use of oral terbutaline to replace intravenous inotropes for maintaining hemodynamic stability.

The aim of this work was to analyze preoperative CA 15-3 serum levels in patients with ductal breast carcinoma in relation to 1) clinicopathological parameters, 2) hormone receptors, and 3) tissue-based tumor markers. Methods: A group of 340 women with infiltrating ductal carcinoma of the breast who had undergone no prior treatment was studied. These women ranged in age between 27 and 83 years (mean age 61.5 +/- 9.9 years). Preoperative CA 15-3 serum levels were determined by an immunoradiometric method. Hormone receptors (estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors), p53, bcl-2 and Ki67 were determined by different immunohistochemical methods. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was analyzed in the cell membranes by radioligand assay whereas cathepsin D and pS2 were determined by immunoradiometric analysis. Tumor ploidy and S-phase fraction were studied by flow cytometry. Results: CA 15-3 serum levels were higher in postmenopausal women (p=0.032), in patients with tumors exceeding 2 cm (p=0.003), lymph node involvement (p=0.026), distant metastases (M1) (p<0.0001), S-phase fraction <7% (p=0.015), EGFR <6 fmol/mg protein (p=0.025), and cathepsin D <50 pmol/mg protein (p=0.023). Conclusions: Preoperative CA 15-3 serum levels were associated with cell proliferation determined by the S-phase fraction, the concentration of cathepsin D in the cytosol, and the EGFR concentration in the cell membrane.

We compared the pharmacological profiles of mAChRs in intact segments and homogenates of rat cerebral cortex and other tissues by using radioligand binding assays with [(3)H]N-methylscopolamine ([(3)H]NMS). Recombinant M(1) and M(3) mAChRs were also examined. The density of mAChRs detected by [(3)H]NMS binding to rat cerebral cortex segments and homogenates was the same (approximately 1400 fmol/mg tissue protein), but the dissociation constant of [(3)H]NMS was significantly different (1400-1700 pM in segments and 260 pM in homogenates). A wide variation in [(3)H]NMS binding affinity was also observed among the segments of other tissues (ranging from 139 pM in urinary bladder muscle to 1130 pM in the hippocampus). The mAChRs of cerebral cortex were composed of M(1), M(2), M(3), and M(4) sub-types, which showed typical subtype pharmacology in the homogenates. However, in the cortex segments the M(3) subtype showed a low selectivity for M(3) antagonists (darifenacin, solifenacin) and was not distinguished by the M(3) antagonists from the other subtypes. Recombinant M(1) and M(3) mAChRs showed high affinity for [(3)H]NMS and subtype-specific pharmacology for each tested ligand. The present binding study under conditions where tissue integrity was kept demonstrates a wide variation in [(3)H]NMS binding affinity among mAChRs of many rat tissues and the presence of an atypical M(3) phenotype in the cerebral cortex, suggesting that the pharmacological properties of mAChRs are not necessarily constant, rather they may be significantly modified by tissue integrity and tissue type.

J	Lee, S				Lee, Sunghou			Aequorin Based Functional Assessment of the Melanin Concentrating Hormone Receptor by Intracellular Calcium Mobilization	BIOMOLECULES & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article						Melanin concentrating hormone; MCH1; Aequorin; High throughput screening; Calcium mobilization	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; INDUCED OBESE MICE; ANTAGONIST; IDENTIFICATION; DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; SLC-1; ASSAY; RESPONSES; LIGAND	Melanin concentrating hormone is a neuropeptide highly expressed in the brain that regulates several physiological functions mediated by receptors in the G-protein coupled receptor family, especially plays an important role in the complex regulation of energy balance and body weight mediated by the melanin concentrating hormone receptor subtype 1 (MCH1). Compelling pharmacological evidence implicating MCH1 signaling in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure has generated a great deal of interest by pharmaceutical companies as MCH1 antagonists may have potential therapeutic benefit in the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Although fluorescence-based calcium mobilization assay platform has been one of the most widely accepted tools for receptor research and drug discovery, fluorescence interference and shallow assay window limit their application in high throughput screening and have led to a growing interest in alternative, luminescence-based technologies. Herein, a luminescence-based functional assay system for the MCH1 receptor was developed and validated with the mitochondrial targeted aequorin. Aequorin based functional assay system for MCH1 presented excellent Z' factor (0.8983) and high signal-to-noise ratio (141.9). The nonpeptide MCH1 receptor antagonist, SNAP 7941 and GSK 803430, exhibited IC(50) values of 0.62 +/- 0.11 and 12.29 +/- 2.31 nM with excellent correlation coefficient. These results suggest that the aequorin based assay system for MCH1 is a strong alternative to the traditional GPCR related tools such as radioligand binding experiments and fluorescence functional determinations for the compound screening and receptor research.

Interaction of α-conotoxin ImII and its analogs with nicotinic receptors and acetylcholine-binding proteins: additional binding sites on <i>Torpedo</i> receptor	JOURNAL OF NEUROCHEMISTRY			English	Article						alpha-conotoxin; acetylcholine-binding protein; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; radioligand assay; surface plasmon resonance	CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; DETERMINANTS; CALIFORNICA; SELECTIVITY; ACHBP; GI; IDENTIFICATION; SNAKE; PHARMACOLOGY; NEUROTOXINS	alpha-Conotoxins interact with nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and acetylcholine-binding proteins (AChBPs) at the sites for agonists/competitive antagonists. alpha-Conotoxins blocking muscle-type or alpha 7 nAChRs compete with alpha-bungarotoxin. However, alpha-conotoxin ImII, a close homolog of the alpha 7 nAChR-targeting alpha-conotoxin ImI, blocked alpha 7 and muscle nAChRs without displacing alpha-bungarotoxin (Ellison et al. 2003, 2004), suggesting binding at a different site. We synthesized alpha-conotoxin ImII, its ribbon isomer (ImIIiso), 'mutant' ImII(W10Y) and found similar potencies in blocking human alpha 7 and muscle nAChRs in Xenopus oocytes. Both isomers displaced [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin from human alpha 7 nAChRs in the cell line GH(4)C(1) (IC50 17 and 23 mu M, respectively) and from Lymnaea stagnalis and Aplysia californica AChBPs (IC50 2.0-9.0 mu M). According to SPR measurements, both isomers bound to immobilized AChBPs and competed with AChBP for immobilized alpha-bungarotoxin (K-d and IC50 2.5-8.2 mu M). On Torpedo nAChR, alpha-conotoxin [125I]-ImII(W10Y) revealed specific binding (K-d 1.5-6.1 mu M) and could be displaced by alpha-conotoxin ImII, ImIIiso and ImII(W10Y) with IC50 2.7, 2.2 and 3.1 mu M, respectively. As alpha-cobratoxin and alpha-conotoxin ImI displaced [125I]-ImII(W10Y) only at higher concentrations (IC50 >= 90 mu M), our results indicate that alpha-conotoxin ImII and its congeners have an additional binding site on Torpedo nAChR distinct from the site for agonists/competitive antagonists.

Identification and Characterization of NDT 9513727 [<i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-bis(1,3-Benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)-1-butyl-2,4-diphenyl-1<i>H</i>-imidazole-5-methanamine], a Novel, Orally Bioavailable C5a Receptor Inverse Agonist	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ANAPHYLATOXIN C5A; COMPLEMENT; ANTAGONISTS; EXPRESSION; ARTHRITIS; SYSTEM; DOMAIN; C5L2	The complement system represents an innate immune mechanism of host defense that has three effector arms, the C3a receptor, the C5a receptor (C5aR), and the membrane attack complex. Because of its inflammatory and immune-enhancing properties, the biological activity of C5a and its classical receptor have been widely studied. Because specific antagonism of the C5aR could have therapeutic benefit without affecting the protective immune response, the C5aR continues to be a promising target for pharmaceutical research. The lack of specific, potent and orally bioavailable small- molecule antagonists has limited the clinical investigation of the C5aR. We report the discovery of NDT 9513727 [N,N-bis(1,3-benzodioxol-5-ylmethyl)1-butyl-2,4-diphenyl-1H-imidazole-5-methanamine], a small-molecule, orally bioavailable, selective, and potent inverse agonist of the human C5aR. NDT 9513727 was discovered based on the integrated use of in vitro affinity and functional assays in conjunction with medicinal chemistry. NDT 9513727 inhibited C5a-stimulated responses, including guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio) triphosphate binding, Ca2+ mobilization, oxidative burst, degranulation, cell surface CD11b expression and chemotaxis in various cell types with IC(50)s from 1.1 to 9.2 nM, respectively. In C5a competition radioligand binding experiments, NDT 9513727 exhibited an IC50 of 11.6 nM. NDT 9513727 effectively inhibited C5a-induced neutropenia in gerbil and cynomolgus macaque in vivo. The findings suggest that NDT 9513727 may be a promising new entity for the treatment of human inflammatory diseases.

Fundamental difference between the molecular interactions of agonists and antagonists with the beta-adrenergic receptor. Nature, 281, 114.). Recently, we found that agonists and antagonists were not thermodynamically-distinguished at cholecystokinin (CCK)(2)-receptors in rat cerebral cortex. However, in this study, the possibility that thermodynamic discrimination at CCK2-receptors exists but that it was not detected, could not be excluded because radioligand binding studies and functional assays were performed in different rat tissues. Therefore, we have repeated these studies using the recombinant CCK2 short isoform (CCK2S)-receptor expressed in NIH3T3 cells, so that ligand affinity (pK(1)) and intrinsic activity (alpha) measurements could be made in exactly the same receptor system. CCK-8S but not R-L-365,260, S-L-365,260, JB95008, JB93242 or PD134,308 expressed intrinsic activity in an IP assay. The pK(D) of [H-3]-JB93182 decreased with increasing temperature. pK(1) values for antagonists (R-L-365,260, S-L-365,260, JB95008) and agonists (pentagastrin, CCK-8S) were higher at 4 than at 30 degrees C. There was no effect of temperature on pK(1) values for the antagonists, PD134,308 and JB93242. Therefore, CCK2-receptor agonists and antagonists at human CCK2S-receptors cannot be discriminated by thermodynamic analysis. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This hyperpolarises the cell membrane and potentiates both Ca2+ influx and degranulation. In addition, blockade Of K(Ca)3.1 profoundly inhibits HLMC migration to a variety of diverse chernotactic stimuli. K(Ca)3.1 activation is attenuated by the beta(2)adrenoceptor through a G(as)-coupled mechanism independent of cyclic AMP. Adenosine is an important mediator that both attenuates and enhances HLMC mediator release through the G(as)-coupled A(2A) and A(2B) adenosine receptors, respectively. We show that at concentrations that inhibit HLMC degranulation (10(-5)-10(-3) M), adenosine closes K(Ca)3.1 both dose-dependently and reversibly. K(Ca)3.1 suppression by adenosine was reversed partially by the selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385 but not by the A(2B) receptor antagonist MRS1754, and the effects of adenosine were mimicked by the selective A(2A) receptor agonist CGS21680. Adenosine also opened a depolarising current carried by non-selective cations. As predicted from the role of KCa3.1 in HLMC migration, adenosine abolished HLMC chemotaxis to asthmatic airway smooth muscle-conditioned medium. In summary, the G(as)-coupled adenosine A(2A) receptor closes KCa3.1, providing a clearly defined mechanism by which adenosine inhibits HLMC migration and degranulation. A(2A) receptor agonists with channel-modulating function may be useful for the treatment of mast cell-mediated disease.

The present study aims at determining whether 131 receptors are also induced and over-expressed in the brain of STZ-rats at 2, 7, and 21 days post-treatment. This was addressed by in situ hybridization using the [S-35]-UTP alpha S-labeled riboprobe and by in vitro autoradiography with the radioligand [I-125]-HPP-des-Arg(10)-Hoe 140. In control rats, B, receptor mRNA was found widely distributed in many brain regions. Low mRNA levels were found in thalamus and hypothalamus (7-12 nCi/g) while high mRNA signals were detected in cortical regions and hippocampus (18-29 nCi/g). In diabetic rats, B-1 receptor mRNA was markedly increased in hippocampus, temporal/parietal cortices and amygdala at 2 and 7 days (+88 to +150%). Low densities of B-1 receptor binding sites were detected in all analyzed regions in control rats (0.18-0.37 fmol/mg tissue). In diabetic rats, 131 receptor binding sites were significantly increased in hippocampus, amygdala, temporal/ parietal, and perhinal/piriform cortices (+ 55 to + 165 %) at 7 days only. Results highlight an early but transient and reversible up-regulation of B-1 receptors in specific brain regions of STZ-diabetic rats. This may offer the advantage of reducing putative central side effects with B-1 receptor antagonists if used for the treatment of diabetic complications in the periphery. (c) 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AN-215 consists of 2-pyrrolinodoxorubicin (AN-201), a superactive derivative of doxorubicin linked to a bombesin antagonist carrier des-D-Tpi-RC-3095. This conjugate binds strongly to receptors for bombesin/GRP and can be targeted to tumors that express these receptors. Bombesin/GRP receptors are found in 77% of human ovarian cancer specimens. Experimental Design: Nude mice bearing xenografts of ES-2, SKOV-3, OV-1063, and UCI-107 human ovarian carcinomas were treated with AN-215. The antitumor effects and the toxicity were determined. The expression of bombesin receptor subtypes was measured by reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis, and the presence of bombesin/GRP receptors was determined by radioligand binding assays. Results: AN-215 significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited growth of ES-2, OV-1063, and UCI-107 tumors, prevented the metastatic spread of ES-2 cancers, and prolonged the survival of nude mice bearing i.p. ES-2 xenografts. Cytotoxic radical AN-201, the unconjugated mixture of bombesin antagonist RC-3095 and AN-201 or RC-3095 alone had no significant effects. Blockade of bombesin/GPP receptors abolished the effect of AN-215. The expression of bombesin/GRP receptors was not changed after repeated treatment with AN-215. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that targeted chemotherapy with cytotoxic bombesin/GRP analogue AN-215 can inhibit ovarian tumors, which express bombesin/GRP receptors. AN-215 might provide a new treatment modality for women with advanced ovarian carcinoma.

Methods: The effect of several types of flavonoids on platelet aggregation, serotonin release, and TxA2 generation was investigated. Competitive radioligand binding assays were used to screen for affinity of these compounds to TxA2 receptors. Results: Flavones (apigenin and luteolin) and isoflavones (genistein) abrogated arachidonic acid and collagen-induced platelet responses, such as aggregation and secretion, with a less substantial effect on TxA2 synthesis. These compounds were identified as specific ligands of the TxA(2) receptor in the mumol L-1 range, this effect accounting for antiplatelet effects related to stimulation with those agonists. Tight binding of flavonoids to the human TxA2 receptor relies on structural features such as the presence of the double bond in C2-C3, and a keto group in C4. Conclusions: The inhibition by specific flavonoids of in vitro platelet responses induced by collagen or arachidonic acid seems to be related, to a great extent, to their ability to compete for binding to the TxA2 receptor. Therefore, antagonism of this TxA2 receptor may represent an additional mechanism for the inhibitory effect of these compounds in platelet function.

NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						serotonin transporter; serotonin; positron emission tomography; brain; ecstasy; neurotoxicity	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; H-3 PAROXETINE BINDING; UPTAKE SITES; IN-VITRO; PARKINSON-DISEASE; FRONTAL-CORTEX; PET; CITALOPRAM; ECSTASY; LOCALIZATION	Introduction: The primary approach in assessing the status of brain serotonin neurons in human conditions such as major depression and exposure to the illicit drug ecstasy has been the use of neuroimaging procedures involving radiotracers that bind to the serotonin transporter (SERT). However, there has been no consistency in the selection of a "SERT-free" reference region for the estimation of free and nonspecific binding, as occipital cortex, cerebellum and white matter have all been employed. Objective and Methods: To identify areas of human brain that might have very low SERT levels, we measured, by a serniquantitative Western blotting procedure, SERT protein immunoreactivity throughout the postmortem brain of seven normal adult subjects. Results: Serotonin transporter could be quantitated in all examined brain areas. However, the SERT concentration in cerebellar cortex and white matter were only at trace values, being approximately 20% of average cerebral cortex and 5% of average striatum values. Conclusion: Although none of the examined brain areas are completely free of SERT, human cerebellar cortex has low SERT binding as compared to other examined brain regions, with the exception of white matter. Since the cerebellar cortical SERT binding is not zero, this region will not be a suitable reference region for SERT radioligands with very low free and nonspecific binding. For SERT radioligands with reasonably high free and nonspecific binding, the cerebellar cortex should be a useful reference region, provided other necessary radioligand assumptions are met.

Here, we investigated the role of B-1 receptor homo-oligomerization in cell surface receptor expression. B-1 receptors tagged with either the FLAG or hemagglutinin epitope were monitored immunologically and by radioligand binding, biotinylation, and phosphoinositide hydrolysis in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Selective immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunoelectron microscopy with epitope-specific antibodies together provided evidence for constitutively formed cell surface receptor homo-oligomers. Truncation of the receptor from the N- and C-terminal ends indicated that the epitope for oligomerization seems to be located between Leu(26) on top of transmembrane helix 1 and Val(71) at the bottom of helix 2. A receptor construct terminating at Asp(134) at the bottom of helix 3, B1stop135, was expressed in the cell. It is interesting that this construct behaved as a dominant-negative mutant by competitively preventing formation of intact B-1 receptor homo-oligomers, and redistributing B-1 receptors from the cell surface to a common intracellular compartment. In contrast, expression of a construct containing the residues downstream of Asp(134), B1del(2-134), was inactive in this regard. Together, these results are consistent with a mechanism where constitutive B-1 receptor homo-oligomerization is required for expression of receptors on the cell surface and subsequent constitutive receptor signaling. This may be a novel mechanism by which the cell regulates the presentation of this constitutively highly active receptor at various stages of injury.

We evaluated whether a diet and/or treatment with rifaximin or lactulose can reduce serum concentrations of BZDs in 18 cirrhotic patients without HE. Patients were given a standard diet for 7 days to keep the dietary intake of BZDs constant and were then randomized to a 7-day treatment with rifaximin 1,200 mg/day, lactulose 10-20 g three times daily, or placebo. Blood samples were collected at enrollment, at the end of the diet and drug treatment periods, and 7 days after the drug was stopped (follow-up). Serum concentrations of BZDs were measured by a radioligand binding technique after high-performance liquid chromatography extraction and purification and were expressed as diazepam equivalents (DE). No change in serum BZD concentrations was observed during the diet, while a statistically significant decrease from 105.6 +/- 66.5 to 63.5 +/- 49.5 pmol DE/ml was achieved in rifaximin-treated patients (p < 0.05) but not in patients treated with lactulose or placebo. During the followup, serum BZD concentrations returned to 104.5 +/- 74.0 pmol DE/ml in rifaximin-treated patients (p < 0.05 vs. end-treatment values), while no significant change was observed in the lactulose- and placebo-treated patients. These data indicate that control of bacterial flora with cyclic administration of rifaximin plays a pivotal role in avoiding increased plasma concentrations of BZDs, which represent a precipitating factor for HE inpatients with severe liver disease.

While the members of the neonicotinoid class have many structural features in common, it is not known whether they also share the same mode of binding to the target receptor. Previous competition studies with [H-3]imidacloprid, the first commercialised neonicotinoid, indicated that thiamethoxam, representing a novel structural sub-class, may bind in a different way from that of other neonicotinoids. In the present work we analysed the mode of [H-3]imidacloprid displacement by established neonicotinoids and newly synthesized analogues in the aphids Myzus persicae Sulzer and Aphis craccivora Koch. We found two classes of neonicotinoids with distinct modes of interference with [H-3]imidacloprid, described as direct competitive inhibition and non-competitive inhibition, respectively. Competitive neonicotinoids were acetamiprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, clothianidin and nithiazine, whereas thiamethoxam and the N-methyl analogues of imidacloprid and clothianidin showed noncompetitive inhibition. The chloropyridine or chlorothiazole, heterocycles, the polar pharmacophore parts, such as nitroimino, cyanoimino and nitromethylene, and the cyclic or acyclic structure of the pharmacophore were not relevant for the mode of inhibition. Consensus structural features of the neonicotinoids were defined for the two mechanisms of interaction with [H-3]imidacloprid binding. Furthermore, two sub-classes of non-competitive inhibitors can be discriminated on the basis of their Hill coefficients for imidacloprid displacement. We conclude from the present data that the direct competitors share the binding site with imidacloprid, whereas non-competitive compounds, like thiamethoxam, bind to a different site or in a different mode.

Total specific binding of [I-125]ET-1 and the relative proportions of ETA and ETB binding sites for this ligand were assessed at day 0 (control) and at 2, 4, 8 and 16 days post-inoculation. At day 0, the proportions of ETA and ETB binding sites were 30% and 70% respectively. Total specific binding was significantly reduced at day 4 post-inoculation (32% reduction, n=8-12, P<0.05) and was largely due to a corresponding fall in ETB receptor density at this time point (38% reduction, n=8-12, P<0.05). The density of ETA receptors also fell significantly at day 8 post-inoculation (33% reduction, n=6-12, P<0.05). By day 16 post-inoculation, the densities of ETA and ETB receptors had recovered to control values. The ratio of ETA: ETB receptor subtypes did not alter with P-3 infection. While P-3 infection reduced the density of tracheal smooth muscle ETA and ETB receptors, the contractile sensitivity and maximum response to carbachol and ET-1 was not altered in tissue from day 4 post-inoculation compared with the control. There seems to be a significant functional reserve for both receptor subtypes in this species that buffers the impact of P-3 infection on airway smooth muscle responsiveness to ET-1.

Saturation radioreceptor studies indicated that these 2[I-125]iodomelatonin binding sites were of picomolar affinity and femtomolar density. The dissociation constant (K-d) and maximum number of receptor sites (B-max) were 42.5 +/- 1.79 pM and 11.8 +/- 0.8 fmol/mg protein (n = 6), respectively. 2[I-125]Iodomelatonin competition studies with indoles or drugs indicate the following rank order of potency: 2-iodomelatonin > melatonin greater than or equal to 6-chloromelatonin > 6-hydroxymelatonin > N-acetylserotonin > 5-methoxytryptophol, whereas serotonin and its analogs had less than 20% inhibition at 0.1 mM. Guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) significantly increased the K-d by twofold suggesting that these binding sites are coupled to the guanine nucleotide binding proteins. Immunoblotting studies using anti-MT1 IgG demonstrated one peptide blockable band with an apparent molecular mass of 37 kDa. Melatonin had no effect on prostacyclin or forskolin-stimulated intracellular 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate accumulation. A diurnal variation in binding density, which was abolished after the animals were adapted to constant light conditions, was observed. Age related studies demonstrated that B-max increased as the animal matured. Physiological melatonin concentrations potentiated whereas those at pharmacological levels inhibited adenosine diphosphate- or arachidonic acid-stimulated platelet aggregation. Our study demonstrated G-protein coupled, saturable, reversible and highly specific picomolar affinity 2[I-125]iodomelatonin binding sites in guinea pig platelets. Pharmocological and physiological data indicate that they may be different from the nanomolar [H-3]melatonin binding sites in human platelets previously reported.

Glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis is admittedly the most frequent secondary osteoporosis. The pathogenesis still has many unresolved issues. Although the effects of GCs on cytokine production and recognition have been extensively studied, little is known about the effects of cytokines on GC action at the target level. We have focused on the effects of IL-6 and IL-11 on specific binding by type 11 GC receptors (GRs) in two human osteoblast-like cell lines (Saos-2 and MG-63) that have remarkably different constitutive expression of these cytokines and GRs as well. We have provided evidence that IL-6 upregulates GR binding sites, while IL-11 downregulates these sites, as determined by radioligand binding assay and Scatchard analysis. GR affinity (K-d) did not change after exposure to both cytokines. A number of experiments were consistent with the view that in human osteoblast-like cells, cytokines of the IL-6 family have autocrine modulatory effects on GRalpha (GRbeta is a variant that does not bind specifically in our method). Complex effects of GCs on the system(s) of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines and conversely of these cytokines on GC action could account for the dynamics of bone loss in patients given GCs and conceivably having high concentrations of these cytokines in the bone microenvironment.

In addition, agonist-induced endocytosis of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in particular might be involved in nicotine tolerance and addiction. The existing evidence concerning regulated internalization of cell-surface nAChRs is indirect and equivocal, however. In the present study, radioligand binding and fluorescence microscopy were used to show that agonists cause substantial endocytosis of nAChRs on cultured myotubes. Exposure to carbachol or nicotine caused a decrease in the intensity of fluorescent labeling of clusters of cell-surface nAChRs that was blocked by low temperature. Overall, myotubes exposed to carbachol or nicotine bound 50-70% less [I-125]-alpha -bungarotoxin on the cell surface than untreated cells. The effect of carbachol was significant within 5 min, increased progressively for at least 4 h, and had a Sensitivity Of 100 nM or less. Exposure to carbachol caused the appearance or dramatic expansion of an intracellular pool of nAChRs, which were localized to discrete, largely perinuclear structures. A pulse-chase labeling protocol allowed the selective labeling and localization of nAChRs that had been internalized from the cell surface. In untreated cells, very little internalization of nAChRs occurred over a period of 3 h, indicating that constitutive endocytosis of receptors over this period was minimal. Exposure to carbachol, however, caused a dramatic increase in the endocytosis of nAChRs. These results provide direct evidence that agonists, including the tobacco alkaloid nicotine, can cause substantial endocytosis of cell-surface nAChRs. (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons. Inc.

In this study, we examined the localization of the molecules involved in al-adrenergic receptor signal relative to that of caveolin in the heart and the changes in caveolin expression during the development of hypertrophy in SHR. Methods: We purified the caveolar protein fractions from rat cardiac tissues, H9C2 cells, and rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Using radioligand receptor binding assay and immunoblot analysis, we examined the distribution and the amount of alpha1-AR and caveolin. Results: Caveolin-3, the alpha1-adrenergic receptor, Gq and PLC-beta ubtypes (PLC-beta1, -beta3) were found exclusively in the caveolar fraction in the above tissues. Caveolin-3 were co-immunoprecipitated with alpha1-adrenergic receptor and Gq from the cardiac tissues. The amount of caveolin subtypes expression (caveolin-1 and -3) and the amount of the al-adrenergic receptor were examined in the hearts of SHR and age-matched WKY (4- and 24-weeks-old). The amount of caveolin-3 expression was significantly smaller in SHR at 24-weeks-old than that in SHR at 4-weeks-old and that in WKY at 24-weeks-old. Conclusions: The molecules involved in alpha1-adrenergic signaling are confined to the same microdomain as caveolin. A decrease in caveolin-3 expression may play a role in the development of cardiac hypertrophy in SHR, presumably through de-regulating the inhibition of growth signal in the hearts of SHR in the hypertrophic stage.

J	Young, LJ; Wang, Z; Cooper, TT; Albers, HE				Young, LJ; Wang, Z; Cooper, TT; Albers, HE			Vasopressin (V<sub>1a</sub>) receptor binding, mRNA expression and transcriptional regulation by androgen in the Syrian hamster brain	JOURNAL OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						medial preoptic area; testosterone; vasopressin; flank marking	PREOPTIC-ANTERIOR HYPOTHALAMUS; ARGININE-VASOPRESSIN; BEHAVIORAL-RESPONSE; GOLDEN-HAMSTERS; FLANK MARKING; MESOCRICETUS-AURATUS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SCENT MARKING; PRAIRIE VOLES; TESTOSTERONE	Arginine vasopressin plays an important role in the regulation of social behaviours in rodents. In the Syrian hamster, vasopressin injected directly into the brain stimulates scent marking and aggressive behaviour in a steroid dependent manner and is therefore a useful model for investigating steroid-peptide-behaviour interactions. In this study, we used in situ hybridization and radioligand binding assays on adjacent sections of hamster brains to compare the relative distribution of vasopressin (V-1a) receptor mRNA and V-1a receptor binding. V-1a receptor mRNA and binding are abundant in the lateral septum, bed nucleus of the stria terminatis, medial preoptic nucleus, anterodorsal thalamus and suprachiasmatic nucleus. Moderate receptor binding and low levels of receptor mRNA are present in the central nucleus of the amygdala and a lateral zone from the medial preoptic area through the anterior hypothalamus. V-1a receptor mRNA is anatomically more restricted in several areas compared to the ligand binding pattern, which is consistent with significant spread of receptor protein along neuronal processes. Comparison of V-1a receptor ligand binding and mRNA in intact, castrated, and castrated-testosterone treated animals reveals that V-1a receptors in the medial preoptic nucleus are regulated by androgen, most likely by an upregulation of V-1a receptor gene expression in a cluster of neurones concentrated in the ventromedial part of this nucleus. This study confirms the presence of the V-1a subtype of vasopressin receptors in behaviourally important regions of the hamster brain and suggests that transcriptional regulation by gonadal steroids may play a role in modulating behavioural sensitivity to vasopressin.

The high affinity, K-D = 30 pM, makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing both striatal and extrastriatal binding in the brain. In this work, dynamic PET studies of two macaque monkeys were acquired along with arterial plasma samples. Compartmental analysis and Logan plots were used to analyze the striatum, thalamus, frontal, and temporal cortices and to validate a reference region of analysis which yields a distribution volume ratio (DVR). The cerebellum was used as the reference region. The results indicate that all methods of analysis are in close agreement over all the analyzed regions in the brain. The average DVRs for the two monkeys was found to be: caudate = 26, putamen = 29, thalamus = 3.8, frontal ctx = 1.7, and temporal ctx = 1.7 on a high-resolution PET scanner. It was found that a scan time of 2 h is needed to accurately estimate the DVR for all regions of the brain. The striatal regions require the longest to linearize and are the most sensitive to variations in time average tissue-to-plasma efflux constant, (k) over bar(2). For the extrastriatal regions, the effect of the (k) over bar(2) term on DVR calculation is negligible. Repeatability measurements for all regions were found to be within 10% using the DVR parameter.

Various 5-substituents were introduced via palladium-catalyzed carbonylation of N-substituted 3-amino-5-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy-3,4-dihydro- 2H-1-benzopyran. The effect of N- and 5-substitution on affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor was evaluated in competition experiments using rat hippocampal membranes and [H-3]8-OH-DPAT as radioligand. Selected compounds were also tested for their affinity to the D-1 (rat striatum), D-2 (rat striatum), D-2A (human cloned), and 5-HT2A (rat cortex) receptors. The intrinsic activity of the compounds was evaluated by measuring their effect on VIP-stimulated cAMP production in GH(4)ZD10 cells stably transfected with the 5-HT1A receptor. High-affinity compounds with high selectivity for the 5-HT1A receptor were found among structures substituted with carboxylate esters, amides, and ketones in the 5-position. Primary and secondary amines bound with lower affinity than tertiary amines. Larger substituents were well-tolerated by the receptor, but the smaller N-ethyl-N-isopropyl bound with lower affinity. Generally, the (R)-enantiomers displayed higher affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor than the corresponding (S)-enantiomers. In the present series of compounds, both full and partial agonists mere found.

Cystic growth is associated with increased intracellular levels of 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are proposed to participate in "remote sensing" by transporting different cargoes, but their relevance to ADPKD progression is poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether cAMP is contained in urinary EVs and, if so, how total and/or EV cAMP contents participate in disease progression. Fourteen ADPKD patients, naive for V2 receptor antagonism treatment, and seven controls were studied. Progression was evaluated by estimating GFR (eGFR) and height-adjusted total kidney volume (htTKV). Fresh morning urine was collected to determine cAMP by the competitive radioligand assay. Urine EVs were isolated using an adapted centrifugation method and characterized by electron microscopy, dynamic light scanning, flow cytometry with FITC CD63 labeling, protein and RNA content, and AQP2 and GAPDH mRNA detection. Total and EV cAMP was measurable in both control and patient urine samples. Total cAMP was significantly correlated with eGFR and its annual change but inversely correlated with htTKV. The cAMP-EVs showed a bimodal pattern with htTKV, increasing to similar to 1 L/m and falling at larger sizes. Our results demonstrate that urine cAMP correlates with ADPKD progression markers, and that its extracellular delivery by EVs could reflect the architectural disturbances of the organ.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) has been re-ported to express significantly in a variety of solid tumours. However, the clinical applications of 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and the mechanism of PSMA expression in patients with BMs of lung cancer have rarely been reported. Experiments with 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT and immunohistochemical staining were conducted to evaluate the expression of PSMA from seven patients with BMs of lung cancer who accepted surgical treatment in Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between October 2020 and October 2021. The mechanism of PSMA expression in BMs of lung cancer was explored by using single-cell RNA sequencing. The median maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in BMs was higher than that in primary lung cancer (8.6 +/- 2.8 vs. 3.6 +/- 1.3, P < 0.01). The mean SUVmax in BMs was 1.76-fold higher than that in the liver, which indicated the po-tential of PSMA radioligand therapy (PSMA-RLT) for BMs. BMs showed intense PSMA staining, while normal lung tissue had no PSMA staining and there was only faint primary lung cancer staining by immunohisto-chemistry (IHC). Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis found that PSMA was mainly expressed in oligodendrocytes of BMs, whereas it was expressed at lower levels in solid cells of lung cancer. PSMA expression in oligodendrocytes might be regulated by the factors ATF3 and NR4A1, which were associated with ER stress.

This study aimed to produce gallium-66 (T-1/2=9.5 h) suitable for radiolabeling, and investigate the imaging properties of gallium-66 labeled GRPR-antagonist NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 for later-time point PET-imaging of GRPR expression. Gallium-66 was cyclotron-produced using a liquid target, and enriched [Zn-66]Zn(NO3)(2). In vitro, [Ga-66]Ga-NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 was characterized in GRPR-expressing PC-3 prostate cancer cells. In vivo, specificity test and biodistribution studies were performed 3 h and 22 h pi in PC-3 xenografted mice. microPET/MR was performed 3 h and 22 h pi. Biodistribution of [Ga-66]Ga-NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 was compared with [Ga-68]Ga-NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 3 h pi. [Ga-66]Ga-NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 was successfully prepared with preserved binding specificity and high affinity towards GRPR. [Ga-66]Ga-NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 cleared rapidly from blood via kidneys. Tumor uptake was GRPR-specific and exceeded normal organ uptake. Normal tissue clearance was limited, resulting in no improvement of tumor-to-organ ratios with time. Tumors could be clearly visualized using microPET/MR. Gallium-66 was successfully produced and [Ga-66]Ga-NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26 was able to clearly visualize GRPR-expression both shortly after injection and on the next day using PET. However, delayed imaging did not improve contrast for Ga-labeled NOTA-PEG(2)-RM26.

This open-label, single-center pilot study estimates extent of occupancy of mGluR5 receptors following single oral doses of mavoglurant, using [C-11]-ABP688 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, in six healthy males aged 20-40 years. This study comprised three periods and six subjects were divided into two cohorts. On Day 1 (Period 1), baseline clinical data and safety samples were obtained along with PET scan. During Period 2 (1-7 days after Period 1), cohort 1 and 2 received mavoglurant 25 mg and 100 mg, respectively. During Period 3 (7 days after Period 2), cohort 1 and 2 received mavoglurant 200 mg and 400 mg, respectively. Mavoglurant showed the highest distribution volumes in the cingulate region with lower uptake in cerebellum and white matter, possibly because myelinated axonal sheets maybe devoid of mGlu5 receptors. Maximum concentrations of mavoglurant were observed around 2-3.25 h post-dose. Mavoglurant passed the blood-brain barrier and induced dose- and exposure-dependent displacement of [C-11]-ABP688 from the mGluR5 receptors, 3-4 h post-administration (27%, 59%, 74%, 85% receptor occupancy for mavoglurant 25 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg, 400 mg dose, respectively). There were no severe adverse effects or clinically significant changes in safety parameters. This is the first human receptor occupancy study completed with Mavoglurant. It served to guide the dosing of mavoglurant in the past and currently ongoing clinical studies. Furthermore, it confirms the utility of [C-11]-ABP688 as a unique tool to study drug-induced occupancy of mGlu5 receptors in the living human brain.

[<SUP>18</SUP>F]FEPPA PET imaging for monitoring CD68-positive microglia/macrophage neuroinflammation in nonhuman primates	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						FEPPA; TSPO; CD68; Microglia; Macrophage; Neuroinflammation; Monkeys; Graft	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PROTEIN 18 KDA; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; 18-KDA TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; STEM-CELLS; MICROGLIA; TSPO; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; DISEASE	Purpose The aim of this study was to examine whether the translocator protein 18-kDa (TSPO) PET ligand [F-18]FEPPA has the sensitivity for detecting changes in CD68-positive microglial/macrophage activation in hemiparkinsonian rhesus macaques treated with allogeneic grafts of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived midbrain dopaminergic neurons (iPSC-mDA). Methods In vivo positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [F-18]FEPPA was used in conjunction withpostmortemCD68 immunostaining to evaluate neuroinflammation in the brains of hemiparkinsonian rhesus macaques (n= 6) that received allogeneic iPSC-mDA grafts in the putamen ipsilateral to MPTP administration. Results Based on assessment of radiotracer uptake and confirmed by visual inspection of the imaging data, nonhuman primates with allogeneic grafts showed increased [F-18]FEPPA binding at the graft sites relative to the contralateral putamen. From PET asymmetry analysis of the images, the mean asymmetry index of the monkeys was AI = - 0.085 +/- 0.018. Evaluation and scoring of CD68 immunoreactivity by an investigator blind to the treatment identified significantly more neuroinflammation in the grafted areas of the putamen compared to the contralateral putamen (p= 0.0004). [F-18]FEPPA PET AI showed a positive correlation with CD68 immunoreactivity AI ratings in the monkeys (Spearman's rho= 0.94;p= 0.005). Conclusion These findings reveal that [F-18]FEPPA PET is an effective marker for detecting increased CD68-positive microglial/macrophage activation and demonstrates sufficient sensitivity to detect changes in neuroinflammation in vivo following allogeneic cell engraftment.

The thyroid transporter OATP1C1, expressed in the choroid plexus and in astrocytes, is also a potential pharmacological target. Based on their established pharmacological relevance, screening the drug interaction profile of OATP1A2 and OATP1C1 is highly desirable. However, drug interaction screens require suitable model systems and functional assays. In the current study, uptake of a set of cell-impermeable fluorescent dyes was screened in HEK-293 and A431 cell lines overexpressing OATP1A2 and OATP1C1. Based on the uptake of fluorescent dye substrates, a functional assay was developed, which was used to characterize OATP inhibitors/substrates. We identify Live/Dead Green (LDG), Live-or-Dye 488, and sulforhodamines 101, G, and B as novel fluorescent substrates of OATP1A2 and OATP1C1. We show that LDG uptake is proportional to OATP1A2/1C1 expression, allowing the isolation of cells expressing high transporter levels. Additionally, dye uptake can be used to characterize the drug interaction pattern of OATP1A2 and OATP1C1. We demonstrate that third-generation P-glycoprotein inhibitors elacridar, tariquidar, and zosuquidar inhibit OATP1A2 function. Increased toxicity of elacridar in OATP1A2-expressing cells suggests that OATP1A2 may modulate the distribution of this compound. The fluorescence-based assays developed in the current study are a good alternative of radioligand-based tests and pave the way toward high-throughput screens for OATP1A2/1C1 drug interaction studies.

Potent nonopioid antinociceptive activity of telocinobufagin in models of acute pain in mice	PAIN REPORTS			English	Article						Telocinobufagin; Analgesics; Bufadienolides; Animal venoms		Introduction:In recent decades, several researches have been conducted in search of new analgesics that do not present the side effects of opioids. In this context, animal venoms contain natural painkillers that have been used for the development of new analgesics.Objective:The aims of this study were to evaluate the antinociceptive effects of telocinobufagin (TCB), a bufadienolide isolated from Rhinella jimi venom, in murine acute pain models, and to verify the participation of the opioid system in these effects.Methods:TCB was purified from R. jimi venom by high-performance liquid chromatography, and its structure was confirmed by spectrometric techniques. TCB was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) (0.062, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg.kg(-1)) and orally (p.o.) (0.625, 1.125, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg.kg(-1)) in mice, which were then subjected to pain tests: acetic acid-induced writhing, formalin, tail-flick, and hot-plate. Involvement of the opioid system in TCB action was evaluated by naloxone i.p. injected (2.5 mg.kg(-1)) 20 minutes before TCB administration. In addition, the TCB action on the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors was performed by radioligand binding assays.Results:In all the tests used, TCB showed dose-dependent antinociceptive activity with more than 90% inhibition of the nociceptive responses at the doses of 1 mg.kg(-1) (i.p.) and 10 mg.kg(-1) (p.o.). Naloxone did not alter the effect of TCB. In addition, TCB did not act on the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors.Conclusion:The results suggest that TCB may represent a novel potential nonopioid therapeutic analgesic for treatment of acute pains.

Comparative evaluation of the new GRPR-antagonist <SUP>111</SUP>In-SB9 and <SUP>111</SUP>In-AMBA in prostate cancer models: Implications of in vivo stability	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						In-111-AMBA; In-111-labeled GRPR-antagonist; bombesin; GRPR targeting; in vivo neprilysin inhibition; neprilysin; phosphoramidon; prostate cancer	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PEPTIDE RECEPTOR-ANTAGONIST; BOMBESIN ANALOG; PET; AGONIST; ENDOPEPTIDASE-24.11; LU-177-AMBA; INHIBITION; EXPRESSION	Gastrin-releasing peptide receptors (GRPRs) are overexpressed in prostate cancer, representing attractive targets for diagnosis and therapy with bombesin (BBN)-like radioligands. GRPR-antagonists have lately attracted much attention owing to inherent biosafety and favorable pharmacokinetics. We herein present the GRPR-antagonist SB9 structurally resembling the known BBN-based agonist AMBA (SB9 = [Leu(13)NHEt-desMet(14)]AMBA). The profiles of In-111-SB9 and In-111-AMBA were directly compared in PC-3 cells and tumor-bearing mice. SB9 and AMBA displayed high GRPR affinities. In-111-AMBA strongly internalized in PC-3 cells, while In-111-SB9 remained bound on the cell surface showing a typical GRPR-radioantagonist profile. In-111-SB9 was more stable than In-111-AMBA, but coinjection of the neprilysin (NEP) inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA) stabilized both in vivo. The radioligands displayed high tumor uptake (20.23 +/- 3.41 %ID/g and 18.53 +/- 1.54 %ID/g, respectively, at 4 hours pi), but In-111-SB9 washed faster from background. PA coinjection led to significant increase of tumor uptake, combined with better clearance for In-111-SB9. In short, this study has revealed superior pharmacokinetics and higher stability for the GRPR-antagonist In-111-SB9 vs the corresponding agonist In-111-AMBA consolidating previous evidence that GRPR antagonists are preferable to agonists for tumor imaging and therapy. It has also demonstrated that further pharmacokinetic improvements were feasible by in situ metabolic radioligand stabilization using PA.

Activation of the adenosine A(1) receptor (A(1), R) inhibits lipolysis in adipocytes and hence reduces the concentration of FFA, which represents a potential target for the development of antilipolytic agents. We aimed to assess the binding affinity as well as target binding kinetics of A(1)R agonists and further delineate a possible relationship with their antilipolytic effect in adipocytes. Radioligand binding assays were performed to determine the affinity and kinetics of three representative A(1)R agonists, namely CPA, LUF6944 and LUF6941, on the rat A(1)R. Functional responses to these agonists were examined in both a recombinant cell system and physiologically relevant rat adipocytes. The three A(1)R agonists displayed similar affinity while divergent target binding kinetics on the rat A(1)R. Irrespective of equilibrium binding affinity, temporal analysis of receptor signaling demonstrated persistent functional responses for the long residence time agonist, despite removal of excess agonist, in both a recombinant cell system and in rat adipocytes. By contrast, such effect was less pronounced or even lost for agonists with medium or short receptor residence time, respectively. Our results indicate that ligand receptor binding kinetics rather than their affinity or potency play an essential role in regulating cellular responses. The long residence time A(1)R agonist produces a sustained wash-resistant antilipolytic effect in rat adipocytes and thus may represent a potential antilipolytic alternative for further investigation.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the in vivo binding specificity of [F-18]MA3, a CB2 receptor agonist, in a rat model with local overexpression of human (h) CB2 receptors. Methods[F-18]MA3 was produced with good radiochemical yield and radiochemical purity. The radiotracer was evaluated in rats with local overexpression of hCB(2) receptors and in a healthy non-human primate using PET. Key ResultsEx vivo autoradiography demonstrated CB2-specific binding of [F-18]MA3 in rat hCB(2) receptor vector injected striatum. In a PET study, increased tracer binding in the hCB(2) receptor vector-injected striatum compared to the contralateral control vector-injected striatum was observed. Binding in hCB(2) receptor vector-injected striatum was blocked with a structurally non-related CB2 receptor inverse agonist, and a displacement study confirmed the reversibility of tracer binding. This study identified the utility of mutated inactive vector model for evaluation of CB2 receptor agonist PET tracers. [F-18]MA3 PET scans in the non-human primate showed good uptake and fast washout from brain, but no CB2 receptor-specific binding was observed. Conclusion and ImplicationsEvaluation of [F-18]MA3 in a rat model with local overexpression of hCB(2) receptors showed CB2 receptor-specific and reversible tracer binding. [F-18]MA3 showed good brain uptake and subsequent washout in a healthy non-human primate, but no specific binding was observed. Further clinical evaluation of [F-18]MA3 in patients with neuroinflammation is warranted.

Several studies point to the possibility of visualizing fluctuations in glutamate release by changes in affinity of the mGluR5 radioligand [C-11]ABP688. These studies use pharmacological challenges to alter glutamate levels, and so probe release, but have not measured chronic alterations in receptor occupancy due to altered neurotransmission relevant to chronic neuropsychiatric disorders or their treatment. In this regard, the GLS1 heterozygous mouse has known reductions in activity of the glutamate-synthetic enzyme glutaminase, brain glutamate levels and release. We imaged this model to elucidate glutamatergic systems. Dynamic [C-11]ABP688 microPET scans were performed for mGluR5. Western blot was used as an ex vivo validation. No significant differences were found in BPND between WT and GLS1 Hets. SPM showed voxel-wise increased in BPND in GLS1 Hets compared to WT consistent with lower synaptic glutamate. This was not due to alterations in mGluR5 levels, as western blot results showed lower mGluR5 levels in GLS1 Hets. We conclude that because of the chronic glutaminase deficiency and subsequent decrease in glutamate, the mGluR5 protein levels are lowered. Due to these decreased endogenous glutamate levels, however, there is increased [C-11]ABP688 binding to the allosteric site in selected regions. We speculate that lower endogenous glutamate leads to less conformational change to the receptors, and thus higher availability of the binding site. The lower mGluR5 levels, however, lessen [C-11]ABP688 binding in GLS1 Hets, in part masking the increase in binding due to diminished endogenous glutamate levels as confirmed with voxel-wise analysis.

However, limitations are a low PSMA expression in certain patients. Androgen receptor axis inhibition can induce PSMA expression in vitro. We hypothesized that different approved compounds upregulate PSMA expression and tested their effect in vitro. MethodsAndrogen receptor (AR) expressing prostate cancer (LNCaP) and epithelial prostate cells (PNT1A) were treated for 7 days with enzalutamide, dutasteride, rapamycin, metformin, lovastatin, and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). PSMA and AR protein expression was assessed using flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. Furthermore, uptake and internalization of Lu-177-PSMA-617 was performed. ResultsEnzalutamide and dutasteride led to a significant (both P<0.05) upregulation of PSMA surface levels in LNCaP cells. In addition, treatment with rapamycin showed a non-significant trend toward PSMA upregulation. No changes were detected after treatment with vehicle, metformin, lovastatin, and ASA. Total PSMA protein expression was significantly enhanced after treatment with enzalutamide and rapamycin (both P<0.05), whereas dutasteride led to a non-significant upregulation. Uptake of Lu-177-PSMA-617 was significantly increased after treatment of LNCaP with enzalutamide, dutasteride, and rapamycin (P<0.05). In addition, internalization was significantly increased by enzalutamide and rapamycin (P<0.05), and non-significantly increased by dutasteride. ConclusionIn conclusion, our data provide new insights into the effect of different approved pharmacological compounds that can markedly upregulate PSMA expression and radioligand uptake in vitro. Pharmacologically induced PSMA expression may prove useful to improve prostate cancer detection and to enhance anticancer effects in PSMA-based therapy.

Structure of the complement C5a receptor bound to the extra-helical antagonist NDT9513727	NATURE			English	Article							CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SMALL-MOLECULE; OPIOID RECEPTOR; OLIGOMERIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; ACID; GPCR	The complement system is a crucial component of the host response to infection and tissue damage. Activation of the complement cascade generates anaphylatoxins including C5a and C3a. C5a exerts a pro-inflammatory effect via the G-protein-coupled receptor C5a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor 1 (C5aR1, also known as CD88) that is expressed on cells of myeloid origin(1,2). Inhibitors of the complement system have long been of interest as potential drugs for the treatment of diseases such as sepsis, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease and ischaemia-reperfusion injuries(1). More recently, a role of C5a in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease has been identified(3). Peptide antagonists based on the C5a ligand have progressed to phase 2 trials in psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis; however, these compounds exhibited problems with off-target activity, production costs, potential immunogenicity and poor oral bioavailability. Several small-molecule competitive antagonists for C5aR1, such as W-54011(5) and NDT9513727(6), have been identified by C5a radioligand-binding assays(4). NDT9513727 is a non-peptide inverse agonist of C5aR1, and is highly selective for the primate and gerbil receptors over those of other species. Here, to study the mechanism of action of C5a antagonists, we determine the structure of a thermostabilized C5aR1 (known as C5aR1 StaR) in complex with NDT9513727. We found that the small molecule bound between transmembrane helices 3, 4 and 5, outside the helical bundle. One key interaction between the small molecule and residue Trp213(5.49) seems to determine the species selectivity of the compound. The structure demonstrates that NDT9513727 exerts its inverse-agonist activity through an extra-helical mode of action.

A Novel Selective Inverse Agonist of the CB<sub>2</sub> Receptor as a Radiolabeled Tool Compound for Kinetic Binding Studies	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; PERIPHERAL CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; ENDOCANNABINOID SYSTEM; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; THERAPEUTIC TARGET; LIGAND-BINDING; SR 144528; EFFICACY; ACTIVATION; ANANDAMIDE	The endocannabinoid system, and in particular the cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2R), raised the interest of many medicinal chemistry programs for its therapeutic relevance in several (patho)physiologic processes. However, the physico-chemical properties of tool compounds for CB2R (e.g., the radioligand [H-3] CP55,940) are not optimal, despite the research efforts in developing effective drugs to target this system. At the same time, the importance of drug-target binding kinetics is growing since the kinetic binding profile of a ligand may provide important insights for the resulting in vivo efficacy. In this context we synthesized and characterized [H-3] RO6957022, a highly selective CB2R inverse agonist, as a radiolabeled tool compound. In equilibrium and kinetic binding experiments [H-3] RO6957022 showed high affinity for human CB2R with fast association (k(on)) and moderate dissociation (k(off)) kinetics. To demonstrate the robustness of [3H] RO6957022 binding, affinity studies were carried out for a wide range of CB2R reference ligands, spanning the range of full, partial, and inverse agonists. Finally, we used [H-3] RO6957022 to study the kinetic binding profiles (i.e., k(on) and k(off) values) of selected synthetic and endogenous (i.e., 2-arachidonoylglycerol, anandamide, and noladin ether) CB2R ligands by competition association experiments. All tested ligands, and in particular the endocannabinoids, displayed distinct kinetic profiles, shedding more light on their mechanism of action and the importance of association rates in the determination of CB2R affinity. Altogether, this study shows that the use of a novel tool compound, i.e., [H-3] RO6957022, can support the development of novel ligands with a repertoire of kinetic binding profiles for CB2R.

ATRIDAT was conjugated to D-biotin for pretargeting via biotin avidin interaction. This model provides high tumor targeting efficiency and stability to biotinidase activity leading to modest signal amplification at the tumor site. Cyclization of triethylenetetramine with protected diethylamino malonate resulted in the formation of 13 membered diamide ring. D-Biotin was then anchored on the pendant amine rendering alpha-methyne carbon to the biotinamide bond which blocks the biotinidase enzyme activity. Biotinidase stability assay showed remarkable stability toward the action of biotinidase with similar to 95% remaining intact after treatment following 4 h. Binding affinity experiments such as HABA assay, competitive displacement studies with D-biotin and CD showed high binding affinity of the molecule with avidin in nanomolar range. Biotin conjugate was successfully radiolabeled with Ga-68(III) with radiolabeling efficiency of similar to 70% and then purified to get 99.9% radiochemical yield. IC50 of the compound was found to be 2.36 mM in HEK cell line and 0.82 mM in A549 as assessed in MTT assay. In biodistribution studies, the major route of excretion was found to be renal. Significant uptake of 4.15 +/- 0.35% was observed in tumor in the avidin pretreated mouse at 1 h. mu PET images also showed a high tumor to muscle ratio of 26.8 and tumor to kidney ratio of 1.74 at 1 h post-injection after avidin treatment.

The renewed interest in the adenosine A(2B) receptor (A2BR) subtype can be traced by studies in which the introduction of new genetic and chemical tools has widened the pharmacological and structural knowledge of this receptor as well as its potential therapeutic use in cancer and inflammation- or hypoxia-related pathologies. In the acid-secreting parietal cells of the gastric mucosa, the use of various radioligands for adenosine receptors suggested the presence of the A(2) adenosine receptor subtype(s) on the cell surface. Recently, we confirmed A2BR expression in native, nontransformed parietal cells at rest by using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. In this study, we show that A2BR is functional in primary rabbit gastric parietal cells, as indicated by the fact that agonist binding to A2BR increased adenylate cyclase activity and acid production. In addition, both acid production and radioligand binding of adenosine analogs to isolated cell membranes were potently blocked by selective A2BR antagonists, whereas ligands for A(1), A(2A), and A(3) adenosine receptors failed to abolish activation. We conclude that rabbit gastric parietal cells possess functional A2BR proteins that are coupled to G(s) and stimulate HCl production upon activation. Whether adenosine-and A2BR-mediated functional responses play a role in human gastric pathophysiology is yet to be elucidated.

MethodsA total of 662 Swedish children with T1D were matched with 1080 Danish children with T1D and 309 healthy children from Sweden and 283 from Denmark served as controls. Sera were analyzed for the presence of IgA and IgG (IgAG) autoantibodies against deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) and tissue transglutaminase (tTG) with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and IgG-tTG separately in a radioligand binding assay (RBA). Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1 and DQA1 genotyping were determined in the T1D cohorts. ResultsIn the Swedish T1D cohort, 17.2% (114/662) were IgAG-DGP/tTG positive compared with 11.7% (126/1080) in the Danish T1D cohort (p = 0.001) and with 9.4% (29/309) Swedish (p = 0.001) and 5.7% (16/283) Danish (p = 0.003) controls. In the Swedish T1D cohort, both levels of IgAG-DGP/tTG and IgG-tTG were higher compared with the levels in the Danish T1D (p < 0.001). In the control group, 2.8% of the Danish children were positive for both IgAG-DGP/tTG and IgG-tTG, compared to 0.3% of the Swedish. Presence of HLA-DQ2 was equally distributed among 89 children with T1D positive for both IgAG-DGP/tTG and IgG-tTG. ConclusionThe discrepancy in levels of IgAG-DGP/tTG and IgG-tTG between Swedish and Danish T1D cohorts was independent of HLA and suggests that regional variations in comorbidity of celiac disease in T1D is caused by difference in exposure to environmental factors.

This study investigated the test retest reliability of [C-11]CURB as well as its in vivo specificity and the validity of the kinetic model by using the highly specific FAAH inhibitor, PF-04457845. Five healthy volunteers completed test retest [C-11]CURB scans 1 to 2 months apart and six subjects completed baseline and blocking scans on the same day after PF-04457845 (p.o.) administration (1, 4, or 20 mg; n = 2 each). The composite parameter k3 (an index of FAAH activity, lambda = K-1/k(2)) was estimated using an irreversible two-tissue compartment model with plasma input function. There were no clinically observable responses to oral PF-04457845 or [C-11]CURB injection. Oral administration of PF-04457845 reduced [C-11] CURB binding to a homogeneous level at all three doses, with lambda k(3) values decreased by >= 91%. Excellent reproducibility and good reliability (test retest variability = 9%; intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.79) were observed across all regions of interest investigated. Our findings suggest that lambda k(3)/[C-11]CURB is a reliable, highly sensitive, and selective tool to measure FAAH activity in human brain in vivo. Moreover, PF-04457845 is a highly potent FAAH inhibitor (>95% inhibition at 1 mg) in living human brain.

We imaged the acute effect of ketamine on brain metabotropic glutamatergic receptor subtype 5 with a high-affinity positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [C-11]ABP688 (E)-3-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl) ethynyl]-2-cyclohexen-1-one-O-(methyl-C-11) oxime, a negative allosteric modulator of the metabotropic glutamatergic receptor subtype 5. METHODS: Two [C-11] ABP688 PET scans were performed in 10 healthy nonsmoking human volunteers (34 +/- 13 years old); the two PET scans were performed on the same day-before (scan 1) and during intravenous ketamine administration (.23 mg/kg over 1 min, then .58 mg/kg over 1 hour; scan 2). The PET data were acquired for 90 min immediately after [C-11] ABP688 bolus injection. Input functions were obtained through arterial blood sampling with metabolite analysis. RESULTS: A significant reduction in [C-11] ABP688 volume of distribution was observed in scan 2 relative to scan 1 of 21.3% +/- 21.4%, on average, in the anterior cingulate, medial prefrontal cortex, orbital prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, parietal lobe, dorsal putamen, dorsal caudate, amygdala, and hippocampus. There was a significant increase in measurements of dissociative state after ketamine initiation (p < .05), which resolved after completion of the scan. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides first evidence that ketamine administration decreases [C-11] ABP688 binding in vivo in human subjects. The results suggest that [C-11] ABP688 binding is sensitive to ketamine-induced effects, although the high individual variation in ketamine response requires further examination.

Detection of the secondary, low-affinity β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor site in living cells using the fluorescent CGP 12177 derivative BODIPY-TMR-CGP	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; BETA-BLOCKERS; RECEPTOR; BINDING; AGONIST; CONFORMATIONS; IDENTIFICATION; ADRENOCEPTORS; FLUOROPHORE; RESPONSES	Background and PurposeCGP 12177 not only inhibits agonist effects mediated through the catecholamine site of the (1)-adrenoceptor with high affinity, but also exhibits agonist effects of its own at higher concentrations through a secondary, low-affinity (1)-adrenoceptor site or conformation. -blocker affinities for this CGP 12177' site of the human (1)-adrenoceptor have thus far only been characterized in functional studies. Here, we used the fluorescent CGP 12177 analogue BODIPY-TMR-CGP to directly investigate receptor-ligand interactions at the secondary binding site of the (1)-adrenoceptor. Experimental ApproachThe human (1)-adrenoceptor was stably expressed in CHO cells containing a cAMP response element (CRE)-secreted placental alkaline phosphatase (SPAP) reporter gene construct. Functional responses of BODIPY-TMR-CGP were determined in the CRE-SPAP reporter gene assay, and manual and automated confocal microscopy platforms used to investigate the binding properties of BODIPY-TMR-CGP. Key ResultsBODIPY-TMR-CGP displayed a pharmacological profile similar to that of CGP 12177, retaining agonist activity at the secondary (1)-adrenoceptor site. In confocal microscopy studies, specific BODIPY-TMR-CGP binding allowed clear visualization of (1)-adrenoceptors in live cells. Using a wider concentration range of labelled ligand in a high-content fluorescence-based binding assay than is possible in radioligand binding assays, two-site inhibition binding curves of -adrenoceptor antagonists were revealed in CHO cells expressing the human (1)-adrenoceptor, but not the (2)-adrenoceptor. Conclusions and ImplicationsThe fluorescent CGP 12177 analogue allowed the detection of the (1)-adrenoceptor secondary site in both functional and binding studies. This suggests that BODIPY-TMR-CGP presents an important and novel fluorescent tool to investigate the nature of the secondary (1)-adrenoceptor site.	[Gherbi, K.; Briddon, S. J.; Hill, S.

J	Jahnsen, JA; Uhlén, S				Jahnsen, Jan Anker; Uhlen, Staffan			The C-terminal half of the α<sub>2C</sub>-adrenoceptor determines the receptor's membrane expression level and drug selectivity	NAUNYN-SCHMIEDEBERGS ARCHIVES OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Alpha2A; Alpha2C; Adrenoceptor; Chimera; Spiroxatrine; N-terminus; RX821002	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; CLEAVABLE SIGNAL PEPTIDE; TRAFFICKING; BINDING; INCREASES; SEQUENCE; MOTIFS	In tissues as well as in transfected cells, alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors show poorer expression levels compared to alpha(2A)-adrenoceptors. In order to characterize which regions of the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor are involved in regulating the expression of binding-competent receptors at the plasma membrane, six chimeric alpha(2A)-/alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors were constructed. The wild-type alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors and the six chimeric alpha(2A)-/alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors were transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells, and the expression levels were investigated by radioligand binding. The results show that the C-terminal half of the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor, ranging from the second extracellular loop to the C-terminus, is the main determinant of the low expression level of binding-competent alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors in HEK293 cell membranes. The so-called retention signal in the N-terminus of the alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor had a less profound effect on the expression levels of the chimeric receptors. For seven drugs competing for [H-3]-RX821002 binding, the K (i) values were determined at the wild-type alpha(2A)- and alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors and at four of the chimeric alpha(2A)-/alpha(2C)-adrenoceptors. The results show that the alpha(2C)- over alpha(2A)-selectivity of spiroxatrine, spiperone, clozapine, MK912, and chlorpromazine, as well as the alpha(2A)- over alpha(2C)-selectivity of BRL44408, resides mainly in the C-terminal half of the receptors. To some extent, the region comprising the N-terminal half of the receptors contributed to the alpha(2C)-selectivity of spiperone, clozapine, and chlorpromazine.

Pharmacological characterization of a novel centrally permeable P2X7 receptor antagonist: JNJ-47965567	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						purinergic; P2X7; interleukin 1 (IL-1); autoradiography; microdialysis; depression; mania; neuropathic pain	P2X(7) RECEPTOR; P2RX7 GENE; KNOCKOUT MICE; ANIMAL-MODELS; ION-CHANNEL; ACTIVATION; BIPOLAR; ATP; DEPRESSION; BEHAVIOR	Background and PurposeAn increasing body of evidence suggests that the purinergic receptor P2X, ligand-gated ion channel, 7 (P2X7) in the CNS may play a key role in neuropsychiatry, neurodegeneration and chronic pain. In this study, we characterized JNJ-47965567, a centrally permeable, high-affinity, selective P2X7 antagonist. Experimental ApproachWe have used a combination of in vitro assays (calcium flux, radioligand binding, electrophysiology, IL-1 release) in both recombinant and native systems. Target engagement of JNJ-47965567 was demonstrated by ex vivo receptor binding autoradiography and in vivo blockade of Bz-ATP induced IL-1 release in the rat brain. Finally, the efficacy of JNJ-47965567 was tested in standard models of depression, mania and neuropathic pain. Key ResultsJNJ-47965567 is potent high affinity (pK(i) 7.9 0.07), selective human P2X7 antagonist, with no significant observed speciation. In native systems, the potency of the compound to attenuate IL-1 release was 6.7 +/- 0.07 (human blood), 7.5 +/- 0.07 (human monocytes) and 7.1 +/- 0.1 (rat microglia). JNJ-47965567 exhibited target engagement in rat brain, with a brain EC50 of 78 +/- 19ngmL(-1) (P2X7 receptor autoradiography) and functional block of Bz-ATP induced IL-1 release. JNJ-47965567 (30mgkg(-1)) attenuated amphetamine-induced hyperactivity and exhibited modest, yet significant efficacy in the rat model of neuropathic pain. No efficacy was observed in forced swim test. Conclusion and ImplicationsJNJ-47965567 is centrally permeable, high affinity P2X7 antagonist that can be used to probe the role of central P2X7 in rodent models of CNS pathophysiology.

A study of subunit selectivity, mechanism and site of action of the delta selective compound 2 (DS2) at human recombinant and rodent native GABAA receptors	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						GABAA receptor; DS2; -subunit; 4-subunit; site of interaction; brain-slice electrophysiology	HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CEREBELLAR GRANULE CELLS; ADULT-RAT BRAIN; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; MICE LACKING; NEUROACTIVE STEROIDS; TONIC INHIBITION; SUBTYPES; GABA(A)-RECEPTOR; ACTIVATION	Background and Purpose Most GABAA receptor subtypes comprise 2, 2 and 1 subunit, although for some isoforms, a replaces a -subunit. Extrasynaptic -GABAA receptors are important therapeutic targets, but there are few suitable pharmacological tools. We profiled DS2, the purported positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of -GABAA receptors to better understand subtype selectivity, mechanism/site of action and activity at native -GABAA receptors. Experimental Approach Subunit specificity of DS2 was determined using electrophysiological recordings of Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human recombinant GABAA receptor isoforms. Effects of DS2 on GABA concentrationresponse curves were assessed to define mechanisms of action. Radioligand binding and electrophysiology utilising mutant receptors and pharmacology were used to define site of action. Using brain-slice electrophysiology, we assessed the influence of DS2 on thalamic inhibition in wild-type and 0/0 mice. Key Results Actions of DS2 were primarily determined by the -subunit but were additionally influenced by the , but not the , subunit (4/6x > 1x >> 2-GABAA receptors > 43). For -GABAA receptors, DS2 enhanced maximum responses to GABA, with minimal influence on GABA potency. (iii) DS2 did not act via the orthosteric, or known modulatory sites on GABAA receptors. (iv) DS2 enhanced tonic currents of thalamocortical neurones from wild-type but not 0/0 mice. Conclusions and Implications DS2 is the first PAM selective for 4/6x receptors, providing a novel tool to investigate extrasynaptic -GABAA receptors. The effects of DS2 are mediated by an unknown site leading to GABAA receptor isoform selectivity.	[Jensen, M. L.; Mirza, N. R.] NeuroSearch AS, Ballerup, Denmark; [Wafford, K.

Modifications included introduction of a second sugar moiety at position 2 of adenosine to form new bis-sugar nucleosides and/or modifications of the 2-position linker in different ways. The performed modifications were found to produce compounds with relatively high A(2A)AR affinity and very high selectivity toward A(2A)AR. The most potent bis-sugar nucleoside was obtained with the D-galactose derivative 16 which exhibited a K-i value of 329 nM at A(2A)AR with marked selectivity against the other AR subtypes. In another set of compounds, compound 3 was modified via replacement of its cyclic structure with mono-and disubstituted phenyl moieties and the resulting hydrazones 10-14 were found to have low nanomolar affinity for A(2A)AR. In addition to 3, compounds 10, 11 and 13 have been identified as the most potent compounds in the present series with K-i values of 16.1, 24.4, and 12.0 nM, respectively, at rat A(2A)AR. Species differences were tested and found to exist in different rates. Functional properties of the most potent compounds 10, 11, 13 and 16 were assessed showing that the compounds acted as agonists at A(2A)AR. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We examined the contribution of altered beta-AR functioning in AA to understand these disparate findings. Twenty-one or 28 days after disease induction, we examined beta(2)-AR expression in spleen and draining lymph nodes (DLNs) for the arthritic limbs using radioligand binding and western blots and splenocyte beta-AR-stimulated cAMP production using enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA). During severe disease, beta-AR agonists failed to induce splenocyte cAMP production, and beta-AR affinity and density declined, indicating receptor desensitization and downregulation. Splenocyte beta(2)-AR phosphorylation (p beta(2)-AR) by protein kinase A (p beta(2)-AR(PKA)) decreased in severe disease, and p beta(2)-AR by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (p beta(2)-AR(GRK)) increased in chronic disease. Conversely, in DLN cells, p beta(2)-AR(PKA) rose during severe disease, but fell during chronic disease, and p beta(2)-AR(GRK) increased during both disease stages. A similar p beta(2)-AR pattern in DLN cells with the mycobacterial cell wall component of complete Freund's adjuvant suggests that pattern recognition receptors (i.e., toll-like receptors) are important for DLN p beta(2)-AR patterns. Collectively, our findings indicate lymphoid organ- and disease stage-specific sympathetic dysregulation, possibly explaining immune compartment-specific differences in beta(2)-AR-mediated regulation of cytokine production in AA and rheumatoid arthritis.

It plays a major role in the turnover of damaged macromolecules and organelles, and it has been involved in the pathogenesis of different cardiovascular diseases Activation of the adrenergic system is commonly associated with cardiac fibrosis and remodeling, and cardiac fibroblasts are key players in these processes. Whether adrenergic stimulation modulates cardiac fibroblast autophagy remains unexplored. In the present study, we aimed at this question and evaluated the effects of b(2)-adrenergic stimulation upon autophagy. Cultured adult rat cardiac fibroblasts were treated with agonists or antagonists of beta-adrenergic receptors (b-AR), and autophagy was assessed by electron microscopy. GFP-LC3 subcellular distribution, and immunowesternblot of endogenous LC3. The predominant expression of b(2)-ARs was determined and characterized by radioligand binding assays using [H-3]dihydroalprenolol. Both, isoproterenol and norepinephrine (non-selective b-AR agonists), as well as salbutamol (selective b(2)-AR agonist) increased autophagic flux, and these effects were blocked by propanolol (b-AR antagonist), ICI-118,551 (selective b2-AR antagonist), 3-methyladenine but not by atenolol (selective b(1)-AR antagonist). The increase in autophagy was correlated with an enhanced degradation of collagen, and this effect was abrogated by the inhibition of autophagic flux. Overall, our data suggest that b(2)-adrenergic stimulation triggers autophagy in cardiac fibroblasts, and that this response could contribute to reduce the deleterious effects of high adrenergic stimulation upon cardiac fibrosis.

Among these agents is nelotanserin, a potent, selective 5-HT2A inverse agonist. Both radioligand binding and functional inositol phosphate accumulation assays suggest that nelotanserin has low nanomolar potency on the 5-HT2A receptor with at least 30- and 5000-fold selectivity compared with 5-HT2C and 5-HT2B receptors, respectively. Nelotanserin dosed orally prevented (+/-)-1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI; 5-HT2A agonist)-induced hypolocomotion, increased sleep consolidation, and increased total nonrapid eye movement sleep time and deep sleep, the latter marked by increases in electroencephalogram (EEG) delta power. These effects on rat sleep were maintained after repeated subchronic dosing. In healthy human volunteers, nelotanserin was rapidly absorbed after oral administration and achieved maximum concentrations 1 h later. EEG effects occurred within 2 to 4 h after dosing, and were consistent with vigilance-lowering. A dose response of nelotanserin was assessed in a postnap insomnia model in healthy subjects. All doses (up to 40 mg) of nelotanserin significantly improved measures of sleep consolidation, including decreases in the number of stage shifts, number of awakenings after sleep onset, microarousal index, and number of sleep bouts, concomitant with increases in sleep bout duration. Nelotanserin did not affect total sleep time, or sleep onset latency. Furthermore, subjective pharmacodynamic effects observed the morning after dosing were minimal and had no functional consequences on psychomotor skills or memory. These studies point to an efficacy and safety profile for nelotanserin that might be ideally suited for the treatment of sleep maintenance insomnias.

Sex differences in the activation of the spinoparabrachial circuit by visceral pain	PHYSIOLOGY & BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Colorectal distension; Parabrachial nucleus; Opiates; Mu opioid receptor; Morphine	MU-OPIOID RECEPTOR; FUNCTIONAL GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS; VENTROMEDIAL MEDULLARY PATHWAY; LUMBOSACRAL SPINAL-CORD; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; PARABRACHIAL NUCLEUS; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; ESTROGEN MODULATION; PROJECTION NEURONS; FEMALE RATS	Women are more sensitive to most noxious visceral stimuli, both in terms of intensity and frequency. The spinoparabrachial (spino-PBn) pathway is an essential neural circuit for the central relay of viscerosensitive information, but studies characterizing the anatomical and physiological characteristics of this pathway have only been conducted in males. Sex differences in the anatomical and/or physiological organization of the spino-PBn may contribute to the sexually dimorphic incidence rate for visceral pain syndromes. Retrograde labeling and colorectal distention (CRD) induced Fos expression was used to delineate the spino-PBn circuit in male and cycling female Sprague-Dawley rats. The ability of morphine to suppress CRD evoked responses was also examined. Neurons retrogradely labeled from the PBn were localized primarily within the superficial dorsal horn and sacral parasympathetic nucleus of the L5-S1 spinal cord. While no sex differences were noted in either the distribution of spino-PBn neurons or in CRD-induced Fos expression, significantly greater Fos expression was noted specifically in spino-PBn neurons in males compared to females. Morphine selectively attenuated Fos expression in spino-PBn neurons in males. but not females. Subsequent anatomical studies showed significantly reduced mu opioid receptor protein levels and radioligand binding within the PBn of females in comparison to males. Together, these data indicate that there are profound sex differences in how a noxious visceral stimulus and opiates engage the spino-PBn pathway, which may account for the observed clinical differences in visceral pain sensitivity and morphine antinociception.

We assessed in rats the contributions of NA and serotonin transporters to sibutramine's hypophagic and cardiovascular effects, and whether selective 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT1A) receptor activation could counteract the latter without affecting the former. Food intake was assessed in freely feeding rats and cardiovascular parameters in conscious telemetered rats. Ex vivo radioligand binding was used to estimate brain monoamine transporter occupancy. Sibutramine (1-10 mg/kg p.o.) dose-dependently reduced food intake; however, 10 mg/kg p.o. markedly elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Sibutramine gave greater occupancy of NA than serotonin reuptake sites. Coadministration of the selective 5-HT1A agonist F-11440 (2.5 mg/kg p.o.) attenuated sibutramine-induced hypertension and tachycardia without altering its food intake effects. The selective NA reuptake inhibitors, nisoxetine or reboxetine, did not alter food intake alone, but each reduced food intake when combined with F-11440. These results suggest that sibutramine-induced hypophagic and cardiovascular effects are largely due to increased brain synaptic NA via NA reuptake inhibition, and that 5-HT1A activation can counter the undesirable cardiovascular effects resulting from increased sympathetic activity. Selective NA reuptake inhibitors did not reduce food intake alone but did when combined with 5-HT1A activation. Hence increased synaptic serotonin, via serotonin reuptake inhibition or 5-HT1A activation, together with increased NA, would appear to produce hypophagia. Thus weight loss with minimal cardiovascular risk could be achieved by 5-HT1A activation combined with NA transporter blockade.

Several cardioprotective mechanisms have been identified including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antifibrotic actions. Each of these actions is thought to have the ability to attenuate the pathophysiology underlying the deleterious cardiac structural remodeling that results from acute myocardial infarction (MI). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of resveratrol treatment on the progression of cardiac remodeling after MI. Four groups of rats (sham, n = 6; sham = RES, n = 21; MI, n = 26; MI = RES, n = 24) were treated for 13 weeks, starting 7 days before ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Serial transthoracic echo-cardiography revealed that resveratrol had no effect on MI-induced left-ventricular and left-atrial dilatation or reduction in left-ventricular fractional shortening. Consistent with these findings, resveratrol did not improve the deterioration of hemodynamic function or reduce infarct size at 12 weeks post-MI. Resveratroltreated animals did, however, show preserved cardiac contractile reserve in response to dobutamine administration. Radioligand binding revealed that MI reduced beta-adrenergic receptor density. Resveratrol administration increased beta-adrenoceptor density, so that resveratrol-treated MI rats had beta-adrenoceptor densities similar to normal rats. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction revealed that MI-induced changes in sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase 2 and transforming growth factor beta-1 expression were unaltered by resveratrol, whereas MI-induced increases in atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) expression were attenuated. Resveratrol treatment does not improve cardiac remodeling and global hemodynamic function post-MI but does preserve contractile reserve and attenuate ANF and CTGF up-regulation.

Defining nicotinic agonist binding surfaces through photoaffinity labeling	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							MULTIPLE SEQUENCE ALIGNMENT; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CONFORMATIONAL-CHANGES; AUTOMATED DOCKING; PROTEIN REVEALS; LIGAND; BRAIN; ALPHA-4-BETA-2; EPIBATIDINE	Nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (nAChR) agonists are potential therapeutic agents for neurological dysfunction. In the present study, the homopentameric mollusk ACh binding protein (AChBP), used as a surrogate for the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the nAChR, was specifically derivatized by the highly potent agonist azidoepibatidine (AzEPI) prepared as a photoaffinity probe and radioligand. One EPI-nitrene photoactivated molecule was incorporated in each subunit interface binding site based on analysis of the intact derivatized protein. Tryptic fragments of the modified AChBP were analyzed by collision-induced dissociation and Edman sequencing of radiolabeled peptides. Each specific EPI-nitrene-modified site involved either Tyr195 of loop C on the principal or (+)-face or Met116 of loop E on the complementary or (-)-face. The two derivatization sites were observed in similar frequency, providing evidence of the reactivity of the azido/nitrene probe substituent and close proximity to both residues. [H-3]AzEPI binds to the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR at a single high-affinity site and photoaffinity-labels only the alpha 4 subunit, presumably modifying Tyr225 spatially corresponding to Tyr195 of AChBP. Phe137 of the beta 2 nAChR subunit, equivalent to Met116 of AChBP, conceivably lacks sufficient reactivity with the nitrene generated from the probe. The present photoaffinity labeling in a physiologically relevant condition combined with the crystal structure of AChBP allows development of precise structural models for the AzEPI interactions with AChBP and alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. These findings enabled us to use AChBP as a structural surrogate to define the nAChR agonist site.

Our objective was to explore the pharmacological properties and establish a new methodology for ligand screening for the P2X(2) receptor, which has been developed by the combinatorial library approach Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential enrichment (SELEX). To this end, membranes of 1321N1 cells stably transfected with rat P2X(2) receptors were resuspended in 2% cholate detergent and subsequently coupled onto an immobilized artificial membrane (JAM). The IAM-cholate-P2X(2) mixture was then dialyzed, centrifuged and packed into a FPLC column. Equilibrium binding to the receptor and competition between ATP and the purinergic antagonists suramin and 2'3'-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl) adenosine 5'-triphosphate (TNP-ATP) were analyzed by a chromatographic assay using (32)P alpha ATP as a radioligand. Our data indicate that suramin does not compete with ATP for the ligand binding site and TNP-ATP is a competitive antagonist. confirming previous studies [C.A. Trujillo, A.A. Nery, A.H. Martins, P. Majumder, F.A. Gonzalez, H. Ulrich, Biochemistry 45 (2006) 224-233]. In addition, we demonstrate that this assay can be used in in vitro selection procedures for RNA aptamers binding to P2X(2) receptors. The results demonstrate that the receptor can be immobilized in a stable format and reused over an extended period of time, facilitating the exploration of ligand-receptor interactions and screening of combinatorial pools for possible ligands.

In the present study, the occupancies of SERT after multiple doses of escitalopram and citalopram were compared using the radioligand [I-123]ADAM and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Methods Fifteen healthy subjects received escitalopram 10 mg/day (n=6) or citalopram 20 mg/day (n=9) for a total of 10 days. SERT occupancies in midbrain were determined with SPECT and [I-123]ADAM at three different time points: at baseline (no medication) and at 6 and 54 h after last drug intake. Results At 6 h after the last dose, mean SERT occupancies were 81.5 +/- 5.4% (mean +/- LSD) for escitalopram and 64.0 +/- 12.7% for citalopram (p<0.01). At 54 h after the last dose, mean SERT occupancies were 63.3 +/- 12.1% for escitalopram and 49.0 +/- 11.7% for citalopram (p<0.05). The plasma concentrations of the S-enantiomer were of the same magnitude in both substances. For both drugs, the elimination rate of the S-enantiomer in plasma was markedly higher than the occupancy decline rate in the midbrain. Conclusion The significantly higher occupancy of SERT after multiple doses of escitalopram compared to citalopram indicates an increased inhibition of SERT by escitalopram.

However, preclinical studies have shown that with repeated drug exposure neutral stimuli paired with the drug (conditioned stimuli) start to increase dopamine by themselves, which is an effect that could underlie drug-seeking behavior. Here we test whether dopamine increases occur to conditioned stimuli in human subjects addicted to cocaine and whether this is associated with drug craving. We tested eighteen cocaine-addicted subjects using positron emission tomography and [C-11] raclopride (dopamine D-2 receptor radioligand sensitive to competition with endogenous dopamine). We measured changes in dopamine by comparing the specific binding of [C-11] raclopride when subjects watched a neutral video (nature scenes) versus when they watched a cocaine-cue video (scenes of subjects smoking cocaine). The specific binding of [C-11] raclopride in dorsal (caudate and putamen) but not in ventral striatum (in which nucleus accumbens is located) was significantly reduced in the cocaine-cue condition and the magnitude of this reduction correlated with self-reports of craving. Moreover, subjects with the highest scores on measures of withdrawal symptoms and of addiction severity that have been shown to predict treatment outcomes, had the largest dopamine changes in dorsal striatum. This provides evidence that dopamine in the dorsal striatum (region implicated in habit learning and in action initiation) is involved with craving and is a fundamental component of addiction. Because craving is a key contributor to relapse, strategies aimed at inhibiting dopamine increases from conditioned responses are likely to be therapeutically beneficial in cocaine addiction.

This decrease was already present in cases with early AD changes not involving the frontal cortex, but dramatically correlated with AD neuropathological changes, at its greatest in isocortical stages, which was associated with a decrease in the expression levels of mGluR(I) detected by Western blotting. Moreover, mGluRs analyzed in pure AD were lower than those obtained in cDLB and also correlated with progression of illness. On the other hand, the expression levels of phospholipase C beta(1) (PLC beta(1)) isoform, which is the effector of group I mGluRs, was decreased in parallel in cDLB cases. Finally, the PLC beta(1) decrease was associated with reduced GTP- and L-glutamate-stimulated PLC activity in both cDLB and AD cases. These results show that group I mGluRs/PLC signaling are down-regulated and desensitized in the frontal cortex in cDLB and AD cases and that these modifications worsen with progression of AD changes in the cerebral neocortex. Therefore, group I mGluR dysfunction may be implicated in the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment and dementia in common form of DLB and pure AD. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

GABA(A) receptors of rat cerebellum were labelled with [H-3]ethynylbicycloorthobenzoate (EBOB), a convulsant radioligand. Saturation analysis revealed a homogenous, nanomolar population of [H-3]EBOB binding. Both GABA and 5 alpha-tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (5 alpha-THDOC) displaced [H-3]EBOB binding heterogeneously, with nanomolar and micromolar potencies. The nanomolar phase of displacement by GABA was selectively abolished by 100 mu M furosemide. Physiological concentrations of allopregnanolone (8 nM) and 5 alpha-THDOC (20 nM) increased the displacing effects of nanomolar GABA. GABA (0.3 mu M) and 5 alpha-THDOC (0.3 mu M) potentiated the micromolar population of displacement by the other. Taurine inhibited [H-3]EBOB binding also heterogeneously, with micromolar and millimolar potencies, and 0.3 mu M 5 alpha-THDOC potentiated this inhibition. 5 beta-THDOC did not affect [H-3]EBOB binding significantly but in 1 mu M it antagonised selectively the nanomolar displacement by 5 alpha-THDOC. [H-3]EBOB binding to hippocampal GABAA receptors was inhibited by GABA and allopregnanolone with low (micromolar) potencies and with slope values higher than unity referring to allosteric interaction. High affinity displacement of cerebellar [H-3]EBOB.binding by,GABA(A) agonists and neurosteroids can be associated with constitutively open alpha(6)beta delta GABA(A) receptors, tonic GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission and its modulation by physiological concentrations of neurosteroids.

J	Yang, DR; Niu, Y; He, FS				Yang, DR; Niu, Y; He, FS			Functional changes of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor in muscle and lymphocyte of myasthenic rats following acute dimethoate poisoning	TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						skeletal muscle; blood lymphocyte; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; intermediate myasthenia syndrome; organophosphate	INTERMEDIATE SYNDROME; ORGANOPHOSPHATES; INSECTICIDES	The mechanism underlying intermediate myasthenia syndrome (IMS) following acute organophosphate poisoning remains largely unknown. Previous studies indicated that the mechanism of myasthenia in rats and IMS patients is most likely due to a postsynaptic neurotransmission blocking at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a key postsynaptic component at NMJ. Whether functional changes of nAChR are related to the development of myasthenia has not been demonstrated and addressed in vivo so far. In this study, we attempted to investigate temporal and spatial changes of nAChR in the blood lymphocyte, muscle and brain of rats during the course of myasthenia after acute dimethoate poisoning by using radioligand-binding assay. We found that specific nAChR binding activity in the gastrocnemius muscle and blood lymphocytes of myasthenia rats was significantly increased at 48 h after dimethoate poisoning. However, no changes of nAChR binding activity were found in the lymphocytes and muscle of non-myasthenia rats which were sacrificed at I h after intoxication. Interestingly, no changes of nAChR and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) binding activity were found in the cerebrum and cerebellum of all rats after dimethoate intoxication either at I or 48 h. The change of nAChR specific binding activity in the lymphocytes is parallel with that in the skeletal muscle during the development of myasthenia. This implied that the changes of nAChR receptor binding activity in the skeletal muscle and lymphocytes are highly associated with the development of myasthenia. The functional changes of nAChR at NMJ might play an important role in the paralysis of skeletal muscle following acute organophosphates (OPs) poisoning. (c) 2005 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To develop a model system for studies of human alpha4beta2-nAChR allowing protein chemical, functional, pharmacological, and regulation of expression studies, human alpha4 and beta2 subunits were stably introduced into the native nAChR-null human epithelial cell line SH-EP1. Heterologously expressed alpha4beta2-nAChR engage in high-affinity, specific binding of H-3-labeled epibatidine (H-EBDN; macroscopic K-D=10 pM; k(on)=0.74/min/nM, k(off)=0.013/min). Immunofluorescence studies show alpha4 and beta2 subunit protein expression in virtually every transfected cell, and microautoradiographic studies show expression of I-125-labeled iodo-deschloroepibatidine binding sites in most cells. H-EBDN binding competition studies reveal high affinity for nicotinic agonists and lower affinity for nicotinic antagonists. Heterologously expressed alpha4beta2-nAChR functional studies using Rb-86(+) efflux assays indicate full efficacy of epibatidine, nicotine, and acetylcholine; partial efficacy for 1,1-dimethyl-4-phenyl-piperazinium, cytisine, and suberyldicholine; competitive antagonism by dihydro-beta-erythroidine, decamethonium, and methyllycaconitine; noncompetitive antagonism by mecamylamine and eserine; and mixed antagonism by pancuronium, hexamethonium, and d-tubocurarine. These results demonstrate utility of transfected SH-EP1 cells as models for studies of human alpha4beta2-nAChR, and they also reveal complex relationships between apparent affinities of drugs for radioligand binding and functional sites on human alpha4beta2-nAChR.

Aldosterone fosters progressive renal injury, but the mechanism is unknown. Both Wistar-Furth rats, which are resistant to aldosterone actions, and adrenalectomized Sprague-Dawley rats, which lack aldosterone, are characterized by resistance to remnant nephropathy and by reduced whole kidney citrate synthase activity. Increase in citrate synthase activity is a well-characterized, specific renal response to aldosterone. Therefore, we performed experiments to test the hypothesis that enhanced citrate synthase activity contributes to remnant nephropathy. Methods. Rat models included Wistar (control for Wistar-Furth), Wistar-Furth (resistant to aldosterone), Sprague-Dawley (normal), adrenalectomy (lacking aldosterone), and 5/6 nephrectomy (renal injury). Glomeruli were obtained by differential sieving. Citrate synthase activity was determined spectrophotometrically. Binding characteristics of cytosolic mineralocorticoid receptors were determined by equilibrium competition binding between tritiated and unlabeled aldosterone. Gene sequencing was performed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescent dye terminators. Results. In glomeruli isolated from adrenalectomized Wistar rats with intact renal mass, aldosterone stimulated a threefold increase in citrate synthase activity; this stimulation was not observed in glomeruli from Wistar-Furth rats. Similarly, citrate synthase activity in glomeruli isolated from adrenally intact Sprague-Dawley rats was 65% greater than that from adrenalectomized Sprague-Dawley rats. Compared to sham surgery, subtotal nephrectomy resulted in 100% greater glomerular citrate synthase activity in Sprague-Dawley rats. In Wistar-Furth rats, mineralocorticoid receptor binding was not reduced, and mutations in the mineralocorticoid receptor DNA binding segment were not found. Conclusion. Citrate synthase activity is elevated in remnant glomeruli, and experimental models characterized by reduced glomerular citrate synthase activity (Wistar-Furth rats, adrenalectomized Sprague-Dawley rats) are protected from remnant nephropathy.

The beta(2)-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist, ICI118551 (erythro-(+/-)-1-(7-methylindan-4-yloyl)-3-isopropylaminobutan-2-ol HCl), antagonised the isoprenaline inhibition of histamine release from human lung mast cells with high affinity (apparent pKB; 9.5 0.2), whereas high concentrations of the beta(1)-adrenoceptor-selective antagonist, CGP20712A (2-hydroxy-5-(2-(hydroxy-3-(4((1-methyl-4-trifluoromethyl)-1-H-imidazol-2-yl)-phenoxy)-propyl)-aminoethoxyl)-benzamide), were required to reverse the isoprenaline inhibition (apparent pKB; 6.5 +/- 0.3). Radioligand binding studies using [I-125]-iodocyanopindolol ([I-125]Cyp) were performed on membranes derived from purified mast cells (>90% purity). Binding of [I-125]Cyp to mast cell membranes was displaced from a single binding site with a high affinity for ICI118551 (pK(i); 8.9 +/- 0.1) and low affinity for CGP20712AL (pK(i); 6.0 +/- 0.03), indicative of a homogeneous population beta(2)-adrenoceptors. In contrast, in human lung membranes, these antagonists displaced [1251]Cyp from two sites indicative of a heterogeneous population of beta(1)-adrenoceptors (20%) and beta(2)-adrenoceptors (80%). These data indicate that the beta-adrenoceptor expressed by human lung mast cells and mediating inhibition of mediator release from these cells is the beta(2)-adrenoceptor.

Preliminary data indicated that OPC-28326 has a high affinity at the alpha (2)-adrenoceptor. In the present study, we tested OPC-28326 in isoflurane anesthetized rats at a dose of 3 mg/kg of body weight, given intraduodenally. OPC-28326 significantly increased femoral blood flow, by 447 +/- 13.8%, 45 min after drug administration, whereas carotid blood flow increased by only 3.6 +/- 5.5% (n = 6). Chinese hamster ovary cell lines overexpressing rat alpha (-)(2D)(,) alpha (2B)-, or alpha (2C)-adrenoceptor were established. These cells also coexpress luciferase, driven by CAMP elevation. In radioligand binding assays using cell membrane preparations, OPC-28326 dose dependently competed with [H-3]RX821002 binding, with calculated K-i values of 3840 +/- 887, 633 +/- 46, and 13.7 +/- 1.9 nM on alpha (2D)-, alpha (2B)-, and alpha (2C)-adrenoceptor, respectively. A similar affinity and rank order of potency were also found for OPC-28326 on the alpha (2)-subtypes using epinephrine as agonist in luciferase assays. No agonistic effect of OPC-28326 was detected on any of the alpha (2)-adrenoceptors. Finally, in situ hybridization performed on skeletal muscle tissue sections collected from rat hind limb (musculus gastrocnemius) demonstrated a high level expression of alpha (2C) in the vascular tissues. Thus, the abundance of alpha (2C) in the skeletal muscle may account for the selective effect of OPC-28326 in increasing femoral blood flow.

Exposure of rats to forced swimming or novelty evoked a significant rise in density of MR immunoreactivity in all hippocampal subfields after 24 hr, whereas exposure to a cold environment was ineffective. Time course analysis revealed that the effect of forced swimming on MR peaked at 24 hr and returned to control levels between 24 and 48 hr. In pyramidal neurons of CA2 and CA3, marked rises were already observed after 8 hr. Radioligand binding assays showed that corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) injected intracerebroventricularly into adrenalectomized rats also produced a rise in hippocampal MR levels; an effect for which the presence of corticosterone, but not dexamethasone, at the time of injection was a prerequisite. Moreover, pretreatment with the CRH receptor antagonist (D-Phe(12),Nle(21,38),alpha -Me-Leu(37))-CRH12-41 blocked the effect of forced swimming on hippocampal MR levels. To investigate whether the rise in MR levels had any functional consequences for HPA regulation, 24 hr after forced swimming, a challenge test with the MR antagonist RU 28318 was conducted. The forced swimming exposed rats showed an enhanced MR-mediated inhibition of HPA activity. This study identifies CRH as an important regulator of MR, a pathway with marked consequence for HPA axis regulation. We conclude that the interaction between CRH and MR presents a novel mechanism involved in the adaptation of the brain to psychologically stressful events.

Here we assessed whether there were differences in the efficacy of cocaine to block the dopamine transporters (major target for cocaine's reinforcing effects), as a function of route of administration. Positron emission tomography and [C-11]cocaine, a dopamine transporter radioligand, were used to compare the levels of dopamine transporter blockade induced by intravenous, smoked and intranasal cocaine in 32 current cocaine abusers. In parallel, the temporal course for the self-reports of "high" were obtained. Cocaine significantly blocked dopamine transporters. The levels of blockade were comparable across all routes of administration and a dose effect was observed for intravenous and intranasal cocaine but not for smoked cocaine. For equivalent levels of cocaine in plasma and DAT blockade, smoked cocaine induced significantly greater self reports of "high" than intranasal cocaine and showed a trend for a greater effect than intravenous cocaine. The time to reach peak subjective was significantly faster for smoked (1.4 +/- 0.5 min) than for intravenous cocaine (3.1 +/- 0.9 min), which was faster than intranasal cocaine (14.6 +/- 8 min). Differences in the reinforcing effects of cocaine as a function of the route of administration are not due to differences in the efficacy of cocaine to block the dopamine transporters. The faster time course for the subjective effects for smoked than intravenous and for intravenous than for intranasal cocaine highlights the importance of the speed of cocaine's delivery into the brain on its reinforcing effects.

This study aims to elucidate this mechanism by integrating transcriptomics and TSPO, A beta PET imaging in clinical AD cohort.Methods We analyzed 85 patients with PET/MR imaging for microglial activation (TSPO, [18F]DPA-714) and A beta ([18F]AV-45) within the prospective Alzheimer's Disease Immunization and Microbiota Initiative Study Cohort (ADIMIC). Immune-related differentially expressed genes (IREDGs), identified based on AlzData, were screened and verified using blood samples from ADIMIC. Correlation and mediation analyses were applied to investigate the relationships between immune-related genes expression, TSPO and A beta PET imaging.Results TSPO uptake increased significantly both in aMCI (P < 0.05) and AD participants (P < 0.01) and showed a positive correlation with A beta deposition (r = 0.42, P < 0.001). Decreased expression of TGFBR3, FABP3, CXCR4 and CD200 was observed in AD group. CD200 expression was significantly negatively associated with TSPO PET uptake (r =-0.33, P = 0.013). Mediation analysis indicated that CD200 acted as a significant mediator between TSPO uptake and A beta deposition (total effect B = 1.92, P = 0.004) and MMSE score (total effect B =-54.01, P = 0.003).Conclusion By integrating transcriptomics and TSPO PET imaging in the same clinical AD cohort, this study revealed CD200 played an important role in regulating neuroinflammation, A beta deposition and cognitive dysfunction.

It is a debilitating disorder that affects up to 10% of the world's population. Although opioid analgesics are effective in reducing pain, they present severe risks; so, there is a pressing need for non-opioid pain-relieving drugs. One potential alternative is represented by sigma-1 receptor (S1R) antagonists due to their promising analgesic effects. Here, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of S1R antagonists based on a 2-aryl-4-aminobutanol scaffold. After assessing affinity toward the S1R and selectivity over the sigma-2 receptor (S2R), we evaluated the agonist/antagonist profile of the compounds by investigating their effects on nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth and aquaporin-mediated water permeability in the presence and absence of oxidative stress. (R/S)-RC-752 emerged as the most interesting compound for S1R affinity (K-i S1R = 6.2 & PLUSMN; 0.9) and functional antagonist activity. Furthermore, it showed no cytotoxic effect in two normal human cell lines or in an in vivo zebrafish model and was stable after incubation in mouse plasma. (R/S)-RC-752 was then evaluated in two animal models of NP: the formalin test and the spinal nerve ligation model. The results clearly demonstrated that compound (R/S)-RC-752 effectively alleviated pain in both animal models, thus providing the proof of concept of its efficacy as an antinociceptive agent.

The present study aimed to produce CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells for a non-radioactive binding assay as a platform to identify drug candidates targeting CXCR4. Main methods: HEK293T cells stably expressing human CXCR4 were constructed by transfection of CXCR4 plasmids from the human CXCR4 gene. The CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells were obtained by fluorescence-activated sorting and verified by conducting the competition binding assay of a known CXCR4 inhibitor, AMD3100 (plerixafor), to determine the IC50 value against monoclonal anti-human CD184 (hCD184) antibody tagged with fluorescence probe, phycoerythrin (PE). The non-radioactive binding assay using CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells and PE-anti hCD184 was applied as a platform for identifying the target of natural compounds that exhibited cytotoxicity against cancer cell lines. Key findings: The CXCR4 overexpressing HEK293T cells were produced with high expression (99.8%). The IC50 value of plerixafor determined by fluorescence tagged antibody-based competition assay using our developed cells agree with previously reported values using a radioligand binding assay. We observed no significant displacement of bound PE-anti-hCD184 by the test natural compounds which could be due to non-specific binding to other functional targets or organelles, low potency of the natural compounds, or binding to CXCR4 at deeper pockets. Significance: The verified non-radioactive binding assay can serve as an alternative screening tool for anticancer lead compounds targeting CXCR4 and an essential tool for proof of mechanism study in the drug discovery.

In this study, we developed a novel Ga-68/Lu-177-labeled PSMA-targeted agent for potential for theranostics of prostate cancer. Methods:[Ga-68]Ga/[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-BP were efficiently prepared manually. For in vitro cell experiments 22Rv1 (PSMA+) and PC-3 (PSMA-) cell lines were used. Biodistribution studies, small-animal SPECT imaging, Micro-PET imaging, and therapy studies of [Ga-68]Ga/[Lu-177]Lu- PSMA-BP were conducted in mice bearing 22Rv1 and PC-3 xenografted tumors. Results:[Ga-68]Ga/[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-BP were prepared within 30 min. The binding affinity Ki value of PSMA-BP to PSMA was 8.34 +/- 2.02 nM. Micro-PET and small-animal SPECT imaging showed accumulation of [Ga-68]Ga/[Lu-177] Lu-PSMA-BP mainly in 22Rv1 tumors with a favorable clearance pattern from non-target oragans. Low radioactivity accumulation was observed in PC-3 tumors and PSMA-expressing tissues. The SUVmax for 22Rv1 tumor, PC-3 tumor were 0.77 +/- 0.16, 0.09 +/- 0.07. The uptake of Ga-68-PSMA-BP in 22Rv1 tumors could be substantially blocked by 2-PMPA (-81.82%). The mice treated with either low or high dose of Lu-177-PSMA-BP showed delayed tumor growth. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the promising theranostic potential of [Ga-68]Ga/[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-BP for prostate cancer, while the efficacy warranted further investigation to evaluate the potential for clinical application.

Optimized Methodology for Reference Region and Image-Derived Input Function Kinetic Modeling in Preclinical PET	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON RADIATION AND PLASMA MEDICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Attenuation; kinetic modeling; positron emission tomography (PET); preclinical; quantification; reconstruction; scatter; small animal	CONSENSUS NOMENCLATURE; MAP RECONSTRUCTION; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; BRAIN; RESOLUTION; BINDING; REGISTRATION; VALIDATION; ROBUST	Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of small animals is often used for assessing biodistribution of a novel radioligand and pharmacology in small animal models of disease. PET acquisition and processing settings may affect reference region or image-derived input function (IDIF) kinetic modeling estimates. We examined four different factors in comparing quantitative results: 1) effect of reconstruction algorithm; 2) number of maximum a posteriori (MAP) iterations; 3) strength of the MAP prior; and 4) attenuation and scatter. The effect of these parameters has not been explored for small-animal reference region and IDIF kinetic modeling approaches. Dynamic PET/CT scans were performed in three species with three different tracers: 1) house sparrows with [C-11]raclopride; 2) rats with [F-18]AS2471907 (11 beta PHSD1); and 3) mice with [C-11]UCB-J (SV2A). FBP yielded lower kinetic modeling estimates compared to 3D-OSEM-MAP reconstructions, in sparrow and rat studies. Target resolutions (MAP prior strength) of 1.5 and 3.0 mm demonstrated reduced V-T in rats but only 3.0 mm reduced BPND in sparrows. Therefore, the use of the highest target resolution (0.8 mm) is warranted. We demonstrated using kinetic modeling that forgoing CT-based attenuation and scatter correction may be appropriate to improve animal throughput when using short-lived radioisotopes in sparrows and mice. This work provides recommendations and a framework for future optimization of kinetic modeling for preclinical PET methodology with novel radioligands.

Therefore our work aimed to design and synthesize a radiotracer for the detection of CB2R expression by positron emission tomography (PET) allowing an early diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases. For the development of such a PET tracer, N-alkyl-substituted indole-3-yl-tetramethylcyclopropylketones served as lead structures due to their high CB2R potency and selectivity, allowing radiolabeling on the N-alkyl chain. To this end, eight novel fluorinated N-alkyl-indole-3-yl-tetramethylcyclopropylketones were synthesized, investigated in radioligand binding studies, and structure-activity relationships were evaluated. The most promising candidate was (1-(4-fluoropropyl)-1H-indole-3-yl)(2,2,3,3-tetramethyl-cyclopropyl)methanone (K-i: 7.88 nM at the CB2R, 3430 nM at cannabinoid subtype 1 receptor (CB1R)). A precursor was synthesized, radiofluorinated with no-carrier-added [F-18]F- by nucleophilic substitution of a tosyl group, and the resulting PET ligand was purified, all being performed on a fully automated synthesis module. The tracer was produced in 34 & PLUSMN; 6% radiochemical yield within 2 h and with molar activities of up to 1500 GBq/mu mol. A first preclinical evaluation was carried out including determination of logP, metabolic stability by liver microsomes, and autoradiography. The novel PET tracer for imaging CB2R showed promising results warranting subsequent clinical evaluation. (c) 2022 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Identification of an Orally Bioavailable, Brain-Penetrant Compound with Selectivity for the Cannabinoid Type 2 Receptor	MOLECULES			English	Article						cannabinoid receptors CB1; CB2; pyrrolobenzodiazepines; neuroinflammation; neurodegenerative diseases; central nervous system (CNS); pharmacokinetics (PK); radioligand binding assay	NEURODEGENERATIVE DISEASES; CB2; SYSTEM	Modulation of the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is of great interest for its therapeutic relevance in several pathophysiological processes. The CB2 subtype is largely localized to immune effectors, including microglia within the central nervous system, where it promotes anti-inflammation. Recently, a rational drug design toward precise modulation of the CB2 active site revealed the novelty of Pyrrolo[2,1-c][1,4]benzodiazepines tricyclic chemotype with a high conformational similarity in comparison to the existing leads. These compounds are structurally unique, confirming their chemotype novelty. In our continuing search for new chemotypes as selective CB2 regulatory molecules, following SAR approaches, a total of 17 selected (S,E)-11-[2-(arylmethylene)hydrazono]-PBD analogs were synthesized and tested for their ability to bind to the CB1 and CB2 receptor orthosteric sites. A competitive [H-3]CP-55,940 binding screen revealed five compounds that exhibited >60% displacement at 10 mu M concentration. Further concentration-response analysis revealed two compounds, 4k and 4q, as potent and selective CB2 ligands with sub-micromolar activities (K-i = 146 nM and 137 nM, respectively). In order to support the potential efficacy and safety of the analogs, the oral and intravenous pharmacokinetic properties of compound 4k were sought. Compound 4k was orally bioavailable, reaching maximum brain concentrations of 602 +/- 162 ng/g (p.o.) with an elimination half-life of 22.9 +/- 3.73 h. Whether administered via the oral or intravenous route, the elimination half-lives ranged between 9.3 and 16.7 h in the liver and kidneys. These compounds represent novel chemotypes, which can be further optimized for improved affinity and selectivity toward the CB2 receptor.

The biological underpinnings of ASD are not well known, but the hypothesis of serotonin (5-HT) involvement in the neurodevelopment of ASD is one of the longest standing. Reuptake through the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) is the main pathway decreasing extracellular 5-HT in the brain and a marker for the 5-HT system, but in vivo investigations of the 5-HTT and the 5-HT system in ASD are scarce and so far inconclusive. To quantify possible alterations in the 5-HT system in ASD, we used positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]MADAM to measure 5-HTT availability in the brain of 15 adults with ASD and 15 controls. Moreover, we examined correlations between regional 5-HTT availability and behavioral phenotype assessments regarding ASD core symptoms. In the ASD group, we found significantly lower 5-HTT availability in total gray matter, brainstem, and 9 of 18 examined subregions of gray matter. In addition, several correlations between regional 5-HTT availability and social cognitive test performance were found. The results confirm the hypothesis that 5-HTT availability is lower in the brain of adult individuals with ASD, and are consistent with the theory of 5-HT involvement in ASD neurodevelopment. The findings endorse the central role of 5-HT in the physiology of ASD, and confirm the need for a continued investigation of the 5-HT system in order to disentangle the biology of ASD.

This study aim is to evaluate the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) radioligand [F-18]N-fluoroacetyl-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline ([F-18]PBR06) as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging tracer of chronic liver damage in a rat model.ProceduresA rat model of liver damage was made by bile duct ligation (BDL), which initiates a complex cascade of pathological events that leads to cholestasis and inflammation, eventually resulting in a severe fibrotic and severe hepatocyte injury. PETscanning, immunofluorescence staining, H&E staining, Masson's staining, and Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction(qRT-PCR) wereperformedtoelucidatethecorrelationamongthe expression level of PBR, radioactivityuptake, and the level of liver damage in the rat model of chronic inflammatory.ResultsAlanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and total bilirubin (TBIL) increased after BDL and peaked in 1week, then gradually decreased over the following 3weeks, although still higher than that of control (all P<0.05). Histologicalanalysis demonstrated chronic severe damage in rat livers after BDL. The uptakeof[F-18]PBR06increased inlivers and was correlated with severity of liver damage. Further, the mRNA level of PBR was obviously higher compared to controls.Conclusions[F-18]PBR06 can serve as a sensitive probe to monitortheprogressionofinflammation in liver. [F-18]PBR06 imaging may be used to accurately assess liver damage degree and guide the therapeutic schedule, especially for those patients with severe liver inflammation and damage but with normal or mildly elevated serum ALT and AST. As a non-invasive diagnostic application, [F-18]PBR06 PET scan could be an alternative for patients who is unwilling to perform liver biopsy.

Differential regional decline in dopamine receptor availability across adulthood: Linear and nonlinear effects of age	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						aging; D2 receptors; dopamine; positron emission tomography imaging; regional differences	EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; DECISION-MAKING; BRAIN; TRANSPORTERS; HYPOTHESIS; PET; DEFICITS; DISEASE; BINDING; CORTEX	Theories of adult brain development, based on neuropsychological test results and structural neuroimaging, suggest differential rates of age-related change in function across cortical and subcortical sub-regions. However, it remains unclear if these trends also extend to the aging dopamine system. Here we examined cross-sectional adult age differences in estimates of D2-like receptor binding potential across several cortical and subcortical brain regions using PET imaging and the radiotracer [F-18]Fallypride in two samples of healthy human adults (combined N = 132). After accounting for regional differences in overall radioligand binding, estimated percent difference in receptor binding potential by decade (linear effects) were highest in most temporal and frontal cortical regions (6-16% per decade), moderate in parahippocampal gyrus, pregenual frontal cortex, fusiform gyrus, caudate, putamen, thalamus, and amygdala (3-5%), and weakest in subcallosal frontal cortex, ventral striatum, pallidum, and hippocampus (0-2%). Some regions showed linear effects of age while many showed curvilinear effects such that binding potential declined from young adulthood to middle age and then was relatively stable until old age. Overall, these data indicate that the rate and pattern of decline in D2 receptor availability is regionally heterogeneous. However, the differences across regions were challenging to organize within existing theories of brain development and did not show the same pattern of regional change that has been observed in gray matter volume, white matter integrity, or cognitive performance.

Two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs6295 of the serotonin 1A receptor gene (HTR1A) and rs6265 of brain derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF), may impact transcriptional regulation and expression of the 5-HT1A receptor. Here we investigated interaction effects of rs6295 and rs6265 on 5-HT1A receptor binding. Forty-six healthy subjects were scanned with PET using the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11] WAY-100635. Genotyping was performed for rs6265 and rs6295. Subjects showing a genotype with at least three risk alleles (G of rs6295 or A of rs6265) were compared to control genotypes. Cortical surface binding potential (BPND) was computed for 32 cortical regions of interest (ROI). Mixed model was applied to study main and interaction effects of ROI and genotype. ANOVA was used for post hoc analyses. Individuals with the risk genotypes exhibited an increase in 5-HT1A receptor binding by an average of 17% (mean BPND 3.56 +/- 0.74 vs. 2.96 +/- 0.88). Mixed model produced an interaction effect of ROI and genotype on BPND and differences could be demonstrated in 10 ROI post hoc. The combination of disadvantageous allelic expression of rs6295 and rs6265 may result in a 5-HT1A receptor profile comparable to affective disorders as increased 5-HT1A receptor binding is a well published phenotype of depression. Thus, epistasis between BDNF and HTR1A may contribute to the multifactorial risk for affective disorders and our results strongly advocate further research on this genetic signature in affective disorders.

High affinity in human (hH(3)R K-i = 2.0 +/- 0.2 nM) and rat (rH(3)R K-i = 3.6 +/- 0.7 nM) H3R radioligand binding assays was demonstrated. Potent functional antagonism (K-b = 0.3 +/- 0.1 nM) and inverse agonism (EC30 = 0.6 +/- 0.2 nM) were demonstrated in [S-35]guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)-triphosphate binding assays. Oral bioavailability and dose-related exposure was consistent among rat, dog, and monkey. After oral dosing, occupancy of H3R by CEP-32215 was estimated by the inhibition of ex vivo binding in rat cortical slices (ED50 = 0.1 mg/kg p.o.). Functional antagonism in brain was demonstrated by the inhibition of R-alpha-methylhistamine-induced drinking in the rat dipsogenia model (ED30 = 0.92 mg/kg). CEP-32215 significantly increased wake duration in the rat EEG model at 3 -30 mg/kg p.o. Increased motor activity, sleep rebound or undesirable events (such as spike wave or seizure activity) was not observed following doses up to 100 mg/kg p.o., indicating an acceptable therapeutic index. CEP-32215 may have potential utility in the treatment of a variety of sleep disorders. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Histamine Receptors'. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparative assessment of <SUP>18</SUP>F-Mefway as a serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor PET imaging agent across species: Rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						raphe nucleus; hippocampus; translational research; receptor selectivity; P-glycoprotein	HUMAN BRAIN; MESSENGER-RNA; 1A RECEPTORS; BLOOD-FLOW; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; ISOFLURANE; RAT; BIODISTRIBUTION; RADIOTRACERS	We have developed F-18-trans-Mefway (F-18-Mefway) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors which are implicated in various brain functions. Translation of imaging the 5-HT1A receptor in animal models to humans will facilitate an understanding of the role of the receptor in human brain disorders. We report comparative brain distribution of F-18-Mefway in normal mice, rats, monkeys, and healthy human volunteers. Mefway was found to be very selective, with subnanomolar affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor. Affinities of >55nM were found for all other human-cloned receptor subtypes tested. Mefway was found to be a poor substrate (>30M) for the multidrug resistance 1 protein, suggesting low likelihood of brain uptake being affected by P-glycoprotein. Cerebellum was used as a reference region in all imaging studies across all species due to the low levels of F-18-Mefway binding. Consistent binding of F-18-Mefway in cortical regions, hippocampus, and raphe was observed across all species. F-18-Mefway in the human brain regions correlated with the known postmortem distribution of 5-HT1A receptors. Quantitation of raphe was affected by the resolution of the PET scanners in rodents, whereas monkeys and humans showed a raphe to cerebellum ratio of approximately 3. F-18-Mefway appears to be an effective 5-HT1A receptor imaging agent in all models, including humans. F-18-Mefway therefore may be used to quantify 5-HT1A receptor distribution in brain regions for the study of various CNS disorders. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Monoacylglycerol lipase inhibitor JZL184 reduces neuroinflammatory response in APdE9 mice and in adult mouse glial cells	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Neuroinflammation; Monoacylglycerol lipase	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; A-BETA; COGNITIVE DEFICITS; TRANSGENIC MICE; PROTEIN; ASTROCYTES; PEPTIDES; MEMORY; MODEL	Background: Recently, the role of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) as the principal regulator of simultaneous prostaglandin synthesis and endocannabinoid receptor activation in the CNS was demonstrated. To expand upon previously published research in the field, we observed the effect of the MAGL inhibitor JZL184 during the early-stage proinflammatory response and formation of beta-amyloid (A beta) in the Alzheimer's disease mouse model APdE9. We also investigated its effects in proinflammatory agent - induced astrocytes and microglia isolated from adult mice. Findings: Transgenic APdE9 mice (5 months old) were treated with JZL184 (40 mg/kg) or vehicle every day for 1 month. In vivo binding of the neuroinflammation-related, microglia-specific translocator protein (TSPO) targeting radioligand [F-18] GE-180 decreased slightly but statistically non-significantly in multiple brain areas compared to vehicle-treated mice. JZL184 treatment induced a significant decrease in expression levels of inflammation-induced, Iba1-immunoreactive microglia in the hippocampus (P < 0.01) and temporal and parietal (P < 0.05) cortices. JZL184 also induced a marked decrease in total A beta burden in the temporal (P < 0.001) and parietal (P < 0.01) cortices and, to some extent, in the hippocampus. Adult microglial and astrocyte cultures pre-treated with JZL184 and then exposed to the neuroinflammation-inducing agents lipopolysaccharide (LPS), interferon-gamma (IFN- gamma), and A beta(42) had significantly reduced proinflammatory responses compared to cells without JZL184 treatment. Conclusions: JZL184 decreased the proinflammatory reactions of microglia and reduced the total A beta burden and its precursors in the APdE9 mouse model. It also reduced the proinflammatory responses of microglia and astrocytes isolated from adult mice.

This combination led to the development of IPCIT and FE@IPCIT. Methods: Precursor synthesis was done starting from cocaine in a six step reaction. O-[C-11]-methylation was established using [C-11]methyl iodide, optimized and subsequently automated. Small scale F-18-fluroroethylation as well as optimization of reaction parameters and automation were performed. Affinity and selectivity of the candidate substances were tested in standard binding experiments on human membranes. Metabolic stability and blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration were determined. Results: Precursor compound, IPCITacid, and reference compounds, IPCIT and FE@IPCIT, were obtained in 4.9%, 12.7% and 4.1% yield, respectively. Automated radiosynthesis of [C-11]IPCIT yielded 1.9 +/- 0.7 GBq (12.5 +/- 4%, corrected for decay). Optimum parameters for F-18-fluoroethylation were 110 degrees C for 15 min under TBAH catalysis, yielding 67 +/- 16% radiochemical incorporation. Affinity was determined as 1.7 +/- 0.6 nM for IPCIT, 1.3 +/- 0.2 nM for FE@IPCIT and 37 +/- 13 nM for the precursor molecule, IPCIT-acid. Results from in vitro and in silico evaluations revealed high stability but also high lipophilicity. Conclusion: Present data indicate high affinity and stability of both IPCIT and FE@IPCIT. Radiolabelling, optimization of reaction parameters and automation succeeded. On the other hand, data concerning BBB-penetration are not promising. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The corresponding sila-analogues 1?b-4?b (replacement of the carbon spirocenter with a silicon atom) were synthesized in multistep syntheses, starting from dichlorodivinylsilane, and were isolated as the hydrochlorides 1?b center dot HCl4?b center dot HCl. Compounds 1?a center dot HCl4?a center dot HCl and 1?b center dot HCl4?b center dot HCl were structurally characterized by NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, 29Si) in solution, and the C/Si analogues 3?a center dot HCl and 3?b center dot HCl were studied by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. These structural investigations were complemented by computational studies. The s1 and s2 receptor affinities of the C/Si pairs 1?a/1?b-4?a/4?b were studied with radioligand binding assays. The s1 receptor affinity of the silicon compounds 1?b-4?b is slightly higher than that of the corresponding carbon analogues 1?a-4?a. Because affinity for the s2 receptor is decreased by the C/Si exchange, the sigma 1/sigma 2 selectivity of the silicon compounds is considerably improved, indicating that the C -> Si switch strategy is a powerful tool for modulating both pharmacological potency and selectivity.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of <SUP>125</SUP>I/<SUP>123</SUP>I-labelled analogues of citalopram and escitalopram as potential radioligands for imaging of the serotonin transporter	JOURNAL OF LABELLED COMPOUNDS & RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						serotonin transporter; escitalopram; SPECT; iodine labelling	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; BINDING; BRAIN; QUANTIFICATION; TRACER; SPECT	Two novel radioligands for the serotonin transporter (SERT), [I-125]{3-[5-iodo-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-yl]-propyl}-dimethylamine ([I-125]-2) and S-[I-125]{3-[5-iodo-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-yl]-propyl}-dimethylamine ([I-125]-(S)-2) were synthesized in a Br/I-125 exchange reaction. Binding experiments in rats yielded K-d values of 0.7 +/- 0.06 and 0.52 +/- 0.02nM for [I-125]-2 and [I-125]-(S)-2, respectively. One hour after intravenous injection of [I-125]-2, 0.34% of the injected dose had accumulated in the brain. The highest hypothalamus-to-cerebellum ratio was reached 2 h after injection of [I-125]-(S)-2 and amounted to 2.4. Pre-treatment experiments with paroxetine resulted in effective reduction of the target-to-cerebellum ratios. The corresponding iodine-123 labelled compound S-[I-123]{3-[5-Iodo-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-1-yl]propyl}- dimethylamine [I-123]-S-2 was investigated in a pig single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) study. Between 60 and 110 min after IV injection, the midbrain-to-cerebellum ratio was 1.2. However, the uptake did not differ between high-density and medium-density regions questioning the feasibility of the radioligand in imaging cortical SERT distribution in vivo. These data suggest that the iodine-labelled derivatives of citalopram and escitalopram are not superior to another SPECT tracer for the SERT, namely [I-123] ADAM.

[H-3]-epibatidine specifically bound to nAChRs in rat cortex or cerebellum, but the dissociation constants for [H-3]-epibatidine differed between segments and homogenates (187 pM for segments and 42 pM for homogenates in the cortex and 160 pM for segments and 84 pM for homogenates in the cerebellum). The abundance of total nAChRs was approximately 310 fmol/mg protein in the segments of cortex and 170 fmol/mg protein in the segments of cerebellum, which were significantly higher than those estimated in the homogenates (115 fmol/mg protein in the homogenates of the cortex and 76 fmol/mg protein in the homogenates of the cerebellum). Most of the [H-3]-epibatidine binding sites in the cortex segments (approximately 70% of the population) showed high affinity for nicotine (pK(i) = 79), dihydro-13-erythroidine, and cytisine, but the binding sites in the cerebellum segments had slightly lower affinity for nicotine (pK(i) = 7.1). An upregulation of nAChRs by chronic administration of nicotine was observed in the cortex segments but not in the cerebellum segments with [H-3]-epibatidine as a ligand. The upregulation in the cortex was caused by a specific increase in the high-affinity sites for nicotine (probably alpha 4 beta 2). The present study shows that the native environment of nAChRs is important for a precise quantitative as well as qualitative estimation of nAChRs in rat brain.

In the current study, the region of the Cbtx molecule that is directly involved in binding to nAChRs is used as the target for anticobratoxin drug design. The crystal structure (1Y15) of Cbtx in complex with the acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), a soluble homolog of the extracellular binding domain of nAChRs, was selected to prepare an alpha-cobratoxin active binding site for docking. The amino acid residues (Ser182-Tyr192) of the AChBP structure, the binding site of Cbtx, were used as the positive control to validate the prepared Cbtx active binding site (root mean square deviation < 1.2 angstrom). Virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute diversity set, a library of 1990 compounds with nonredundant pharmacophore profiles, using AutoDock against the Cbtx active site, revealed 39 potential inhibitor candidates. The adapted in vitro radioligand competition assays using [H-3]epibatidine and [I-125]bungarotoxin against the AChBPs from the marine species, Aplysia californica (Ac), and from the freshwater snails, Lymnaea stagnalis (Ls) and Bolinus truncates (Bt), revealed 4 compounds from the list of inhibitor candidates that had micromolar to nanomolar interferences for the toxin binding to AChBPs. Three hits (NSC42258, NSC121865, and NSC134754) can prolong the survival time of the mice if administered 30 min before injection with Cbtx, but only NSC121865 and NSC134754 can prolong the survival time if injected immediately after injection with Cbtx. These inhibitors serve as novel templates/scaffolds for the development of more potent and specific anticobratoxin.

New MRI, <SUP>18</SUP>F-DOPA and <SUP>11</SUP>C-(+)-α-dihydrotetrabenazine templates for <i>Macaca fascicularis</i> neuroimaging: Advantages to improve PET quantification	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article							PARKINSONS-DISEASE; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; DOPAMINE SYSTEM; ANIMAL-MODELS; HUMAN BRAIN; MONKEY; TRANSPORTER; REGISTRATION; RADIOLIGAND; RECEPTORS	Normalization of neuroimaging Studies to a stereotaxic space allows the utilization of standard volumes of interest (VOIs) and voxel-based analysis (SPM). Such spatial normalization of PET and MRI studies requires a high quality template image. The aim of this study was to create new MRI and PET templates of F-18-DOPA and C-11-(+)-alpha-dihydrotetrabenzine (C-11-DTBZ) of the Macaca fascicularis brain, an important animal model of Parkinson's disease. MRI template was constructed as a smoothed average of the scans of 15 healthy animals, previously transformed into the space of one representative MRI. In order to create the PET templates, F-18-DOPA and C-11-DTBZ PET of the same subjects were acquired in a dedicated small animal PET scanner and transformed to the created MRI template space. To validate these templates for PET quantification, parametric Values obtained with a standard VOI-map applied after spatial normalization to each template were statistically compared to results Computed using individual VOIs drawn for each animal. The high correlation between both procedures validated the utilization of all the templates, improving the reproducibility of PET analysis. To prove the utility of the templates for voxel-based quantification, dopamine striatal depletion in a representative monkey treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) was assessed by SPM analysis of C-11-DTBZ PET. A symmetric reduction in striatal C-11-DTBZ uptake was detected in accordance with the induced lesion. In conclusion, templates of M. fuscicularis brain have been constructed and validated for reproducible and automated PET quantification. All templates are electronically available via the internet.

The effect was clearly biphasic - a decrease in the activity was followed by an activation maximum and finally, at high concentrations, drastic inhibition of the G-protein activity was noticed. Contrarily, specific radioligand binding to GABA(B)-receptor was inhibited in the whole range of detergent concentrations step by step, i.e. it was strictly monophasic. The magnitude of both detergent effects was decreased in the same order of potency: Brij58>Triton X-100>Digitonin. The identical order was found when comparing detergents ability to alter fluorescence anisotropy of the membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (r (DPH)) incorporated into the hydrophobic PM interior. Decrease of r (DPH), in the order of Brij58>Triton X-100>Digitonin, was reflected as decrease of the S-order parameter and rotation correlation time phi paralleled by an increase of diffusion wobbling constant D. (analysis by time-resolved fluorescence according to "wobble-in-cone" model). The influence of the detergents on the membrane organization at the polar headgroup region was characterized by Laurdan generalized polarization (GP).

The present Study further expanded the behavioral pharmacology profile of baicalin and subtype selectivity was explored as a possible mechanism underlying its in vivo effects on mice. Baicalin was characterized using convulsion, memory, and motor function related animal tests; and its selectivity towards recombinant GABA(A) receptor subtypes expressed in HEK 293T cells was determined by radioligand binding assay and electrophysiological studies. In the picrotoxin-induced seizure, step-through passive avoidance and rotarod tests, the anticonvulsant, amnesic and motor incoordination effects commonly associated with classical BZs were not observed when baicalin was administered at effective anxiolytic doses, demonstrating a separation of the anticonvulsant, amnesic and motor incoordination effects from the anxiolytic-like effect. Although baicalin exhibited higher binding affinity for the alpha(1)-containing GABAA subtype compared with alpha(2)-, alpha(3)-, and alpha(5)-containing subtypes, this was not statistically significant. In contrast to the classical BZ diazepam, baicalin showed significant preference for alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-containing subtypes compared to alpha(1)- and alpha(5)-containing subtypes in whole-cell patch clamp studies (P< 0.01). Its subtype selectivity suggested that baicalin exerted its in vivo anxiolytic-like effect mainly through the alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-containing subtypes. Therefore, the present study revealed an underlying mechanism for the selective anxiolytic profile of baicalin, suggesting alpha(2)- and alpha(3)-containing subtypes were important drug targets for flavonoid-based anxiolytics.

Herein, we examined whether golden shiner (Notemigonus crysoleucas) or fathead minnow (Pimphales promelas) SERTs and catecholamine transporters respond comparably to mammalian SERTs and NETs. We compared the pharmacological profiles of central SERT and NET binding sites of the golden shiner minnow to those of rats. Homogenate binding with the radioligand [H-3] citalopram indicated that golden shiner SERT has a K-D of 7 +/- 3 nM and a B-max of 226 +/- 46 fmol/mg protein. These values are similar to those of rat cortical SERT (K-D 1.4 +/- 0.1 nM and B-max 240 48 fmol/mg protein). We also examined SERT binding in fathead minnow brain, and found it similar to that of the golden shiner. A putative golden shiner NET, measured using [H-3] nisoxetine, had K-D = 12 +/- 5 nM and B-max = 187 +/- 49 fmol/mg protein, whereas rat hippocampal NET had K-D = 5 2 nM and B-max 93 8 fmol/mg protein. Minnow SERT and NET binding is displaceable by selective reuptake inhibitors. Finally, we exposed zebrafish (Dania rerio) to the serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressant sertraline or the organophosphate chlorpyrifos for 21 days. After either treatment, SERT binding was reduced by 50% (n = 3-6, P < 0.05). In summary, minnow central SERT and NET express slightly lower affinity for antidepressants than rats. However, magnitudes of affinity are similar, and minnow SERT binding is decreased by chronic sertraline or chlorpyrifos administration.

Basal hemodynamic data and vagal response to electrical stimulation and methacholine injection were also evaluated. Muscarinic receptors were characterized using a radioligand receptor binding assay ([H-3]N methylseopolamine). Experimental diabetes (50 mg/kg of STZ, i.v.) decreased systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure and basal heart rate. Heart rate (HR) responses to vagal electrical stimulation (16, 32, and 64 Hz) were 15%, 11%, and 14% higher in diabetics vs non-diabetics, as were HR responses to methacholine injection (-130 24, -172 18, -206 +/- 15 bpm vs. -48 +/- 15, -116 +/- 12, -151 +/- 18 bpm, P < 0.05). Muscarinic receptor density was higher (267.4 +/- 11 vs 193.5 +/- 22 fmol/mg/prot, P < 0.05) in the atria of diabetic rats than in those of controls; the affinity was similar between groups. Diabetes-induced reduction of reflex responses to baro-(reflex bradycardia: -3.4 +/- 0.3 and -2.7 +/- 0.2 bpm/mm Hg; reflex tachycardia: -1.6 +/- 0.1 and -1.4 +/- 0.07 bpm/mm Hg, in control and diabetics, P < 0.05) and chemoreceptor stimulation, enhancement of HR responsiveness to cardiac vagal electrical stimulation and methacholine stimulation, plus an increase in the number of atrial muscarinic receptors indicates reduced parasympathetic activity, which is probably derived from central nervous system derangement.

In this study, receptors for the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and other members of the bombesin-family of peptides, were evaluated in ovarian neoplasms. Methods: 75 primary, secondary and metastatic ovarian tumors were investigated for their bombesin-receptor subtype expression, incidence, localization and density using in vitro autoradiography on tissue sections with the universal radioligand I-125-[D-Tyr(6), B-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]-bombesin(6-14) and the GRP-receptor subtype-preferring I-125-[Tyr(4)]-bombesin. Results: GRP-receptors were detected in 42/61 primary ovarian tumors; other bombesin-receptor subtypes (BB1, bb3) were rarely present (3/61). Two different tissue compartments expressed GRP-receptors: the tumoral vasculature was the predominant site of GRP-receptor expression (38/61), whereas neoplastic cells more rarely expressed GRP-receptors (14/61). GRP-receptor positive vessels were present in the various classes of ovarian tumors; generally, malignant tumors had a higher incidence of GRP-receptor positive vessels compared to their benign counterparts. The prevalence of such vessels was particularly high in ovarian carcinomas (16/19) and their metastases (5/5). The GRP-receptors were expressed in high density in the Muscular vessel wall. Normal ovary (n = 10) lacked GRP-receptors. Conclusions: The large amounts of GRP-receptors in ovarian tumor vessels suggest a role in tumoral vasculature and possibly angiogenesis. Further, these vessels might be targeted in vivo with bombesin analogs for diagnosis or for therapy.

Saturation and competition binding experiments were performed using membrane preparations from Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the three subtypes. While [H-3]-CGP 12,177 had very similar affinity for beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenoceptors (about 40 pM), [I-125]-cyanopindolol and [H-3]-dihydroalprenolol had 4- to 6-fold higher affinity for beta(2)- as compared to beta(1)-adrenoceptors (10 vs 45 and 187 vs 1,021 pM, respectively). The affinity of [I-125]-cyanopindolol at beta(3)-adrenoceptors was considerably lower (440 pM) than at the other two subtypes. The beta(3)-adrenoceptor affinity of [H-3]-CGP 12,177 and [H-3]-dihydroalprenolol was so low that it could not be estimated within the tested range of radioligand concentrations (up to 4,000 pM and 30,000 pM for [H-3]-CGP 12,177 and [H-3]-dihydroalprenolol, respectively). We conclude that all three radioligands are ill-suited to label beta(3)-adrenoceptors, particularly in preparations co-expressing multiple subtypes. In the absence of alternatives, [I-125]-cyanopindolol appears the least unsuitable to label beta(3)-adrenoceptors. There is a need for high-affinity radioligands which are either selective for beta(3)-adrenoceptors or reasonably non-selective among all three beta-adrenoceptor subtypes.

While risk assessments are generally based on quantifying body burdens of toxicants, much less is known about associated adverse health effects and their underlying mechanisms. The purpose of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of methylmercury (MeHg+), mercuric chloride (Hg2+), p,p'-DDT, Arochlor 1254, chlordane, dieldrin, lindane, and toxaphene on [H-3]quinuclidinyl benzilate ([H-3]-QNB) binding to the muscarinic cholinergic (mACh) receptor in cellular membranes isolated from the cerebrum of ringed seals (Phoca hispida). [H-3]-QNB binding to the mACh receptor was saturable with a mean receptor density (B-max) of 826.9 +/- 68.4 fmol/mg and ligand affinity (K-d) of 0.31 +/- 0.04 nM. MeHg+ and Hg2+ were the only neurotoxicants that inhibited radioligand binding by greater than 50%. Hg2+ was significantly more potent at inhibiting mACh receptor binding than MeHg+ when the IC50 data were compared (IC50 = 1.92 +/- 0.06 mu M versus 2.75 +/- 0.22 mM), but when the data were normalized to derive inhibition constants (K-i) there was no statistical difference in inhibition (Hg2+ = 1.38 +/- 0.07 mu M; MeHg+ = 1.26 +/- 0.12 mu M). Toxaphene also inhibited mACh receptor binding by 22.4%, but this was only significant at the highest concentration tested (320 mu M). Overall, these data suggest that Hg, and not organochlorines, inhibits ligand binding to the mACh receptor. These mechanistic findings may be used to support and develop specific biomarkers of Hg exposure and neurotoxicity in sensitive ecological species.

Phylogenetic analysis shows that these shark receptors are orthologues of the MC3R and MC5R subtypes, sharing 65% and 70% overall amino acid identity with the human counterparts, respectively. The SacMC3R was expressed and pharmacologically characterized in HEK293 cells. The radioligand binding results show that this receptor has high affinity for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-derived peptides while it has comparable affinity for alpha- and beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH), and slightly lower affinity for gamma-MSH when compared with the human orthologue. ACTH(1-24) has high potency in a second-messenger cAMP assay while alpha- and gamma-MSH had slightly lower potency in cells expressing the SacMC3R. We used receptor-enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) fusion to show the presence of SacMC3R in plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary and HEK293 cells but the SacMC5R was retained in intracellular compartments of these cells hindering pharmacological characterization. The anatomical distribution of the receptors were determined using reverse transcription PCR. The results showed that the SacMC3R is expressed in the hypothalamus, brain stem and telencephalon, optic tectum and olfactory bulbs, but not in the cerebellum of the spiny dogfish while the SacMC5R was found only in the same central regions. This report describes the first molecular characterization of a MC3R in fish. The study indicates that many of the important elements of the MC system existed before radiation of gnathostomes, early in vertebrate evolution, at least 450 million years ago.

NECA-elicited facilitation of noradrenaline release was prevented by the A,B receptor-antagonist MRS 1754, enhanced by preventing cyclic-AMP degradation with rolipram, abolished by the protein kinase A inhibitors H-89, KT 5720 and cyclic-AMPS-Rp and attenuated by the protein kinase C inhibitors Ro 32-0432 and calphostin C. The adenosine uptake inhibitor NBTI also elicited a facilitation of noradrenaline release; an effect that was abolished by adenosine deaminase and attenuated by MRS 1754, by inhibitors of the extracellular nucleotide metabolism and by blockade of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors and P2X receptors with prazosin and NF023, respectively. It was concluded that adenosine A(2B) receptors are involved in a facilitation of noradrenaline release in the prostatic portion of rat vas deferens that can be activated by adenosine formed by extracellular catabolism of nucleotides. The receptors seem to be coupled to the adenylyl cyclase-protein kinase A pathway but activation of the protein kinase C by protein kinase A, may also contribute to the adenosine A(2B) receptor-mediated facilitation of noradrenaline release.

J	Li, MD; Kane, JK				Li, MD; Kane, JK			Effect of nicotine on the expression of leptin and forebrain leptin receptors in the rat	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						nicotine; leptin; hypothalamus	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; BODY-WEIGHT; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; CIRCULATING LEPTIN; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; FOOD-INTAKE; CESSATION; PATHWAYS	We have previously reported that chronic nicotine administration (4.0 mg/kg/day by i.p. injection over 14 days) up-regulates orexin/ hypocretin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) mRNA expression and peptide levels within the hypothalamus. Since there exists a coregulation between these neuropeptides and the protein leptin, the present study was undertaken to determine whether nicotine has a regulatory effect on leptin signaling. Under the same experimental regimen used previously, we found that nicotine down-regulates plasma leptin concentration by 48.8% (P<0.001) and leptin RNA level by 11.4% and 12.4%, respectively, in the perirenal and epididymal white adipose tissue (PWAT, EWAT) compared to the saline controls. We also measured an approximately 20% decrease in white and brown adipose tissue (BAT) by weight in nicotine-treated animals relative to saline controls (P<0.05). On the other hand, we found that chronic nicotine administration increased the expression levels of OB-Rb mRNA by 12% and OB-R mRNA by 25% in the medial basal hypothalamus compared,to control rats. Subsequent radioligand binding assays indicated that nicotine also significantly increased leptin binding in ventromedial hypothalamic area (VMA), medial basal hypothalamic area (MBA), arcuate nucleus/median eminence, paraventricular nuclei and piriform cortex. Taken together, our results revealed that nicotine is involved in the regulation of leptin signaling, suggesting that leptin and its receptor play a role in the anorectic effects of nicotine on food intake and body weight in rats.

J	Elwan, MA; Ishii, T; Sakuragawa, N				Elwan, MA; Ishii, T; Sakuragawa, N			Characterization of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor gene expression and binding sites in human placenta amniotic epithelial cells	PLACENTA			English	Article							HUMAN TROPHOBLASTIC CELLS; RAT-BRAIN; LACTOGEN RELEASE; H-3 YM-09151-2; L-DOPA; D-2; TRANSPLANTATION; MONKEY; LOCALIZATION; INHIBITION	This study was to investigate the presence of dopamine (DA) D-2 receptors mRNA and binding sites in human amniotic epithelial cells (HAEC). RT-PCR revealed that HAEC express DA D-2 receptor mRNA that is having 100 per cent homology with human DA D-2 receptors. Radioligand saturation binding studies showed a [H-3]YM-09151-2 high affinity binding site with a K-D and B-max values of 0.53+/-0.09 nm and 119.6+/-8.5 fmol/mg protein, respectively. Competition experiments demonstrated that selective D-2 antagonists such as spiroperidol, domperidone and eticlopride potently competed with [H-3]YM-09151-2 binding, whereas selective D-1 antagonists like SCH 23390 displayed weaker competition for the binding sites. The rank order of potency of these compounds in competing with [H-3]YM-09151-2 for the binding sites was consistent with the pharmacology of the DA D-2 receptors. All competition curves were better fitted to a one-site model with a Hill coefficient around unity, indicating that [H-3]YM-09151-2 is labelling a single population of receptors. These results provide evidence that HAEC natively express DA D-2 receptor mRNA and binding sites. Although the physiological function of D-2 receptors in HAEC is currently unclear, the present results suggest that these cells could represent a source of human DA D-2 receptors without transformation or cloning procedures.

This coincides with reduced drug effects through an unknown mechanism. 2 The effect of interferon-induced acute inflammation on the pharmacokinetics and electrocardiogram of verapamil (20 mg kg(-1), p.o.) and nifedipine (0.1 mg kg(-1), i.v.) was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats. 3 The effect of both acute and chronic inflammation on radioligand binding to cardiac L-type calcium channels was also investigated. 4 Acute inflammation resulted in increased plasma concentration of verapamil but had no effect on that of nifedipine. Verapamil binding to plasma proteins was unaffected. 5 As has been reported for humans, the increased verapamil concentration coincided with a reduction in the degree to which PR interval is prolonged by the drug. The effect of nifedipine on PR interval was also reduced by inflammation. 6 Maximum binding of H-3-nitrendipine to cardiac cell membrane was significantly reduced from 63.2+/-2.5 fmol mg(-1) protein in controls to 46.4+/-2.0 in acute inflammation and from 66.8+/-2.2 fmol mg(-1) protein in controls to 42.2+/-2.0 in chronic inflammation. 7 Incubation of the normal cardiac cell membranes with 100 and 1000 pg ml(-1) of rat tissue necrosis factor-alpha did not influence the binding indices to the calcium channels. 8 Our data suggest that the reduced calcium channel responsiveness is because of altered binding to channels.

Here we report the first in vivo visualization of human brain areas containing nAChRs by using PET and 2-[F-18]fluoro-3-(2(S)azetidinylmethoxy)pyridine (2-[F-18]FA). We acquired scans from six healthy non-smoking volunteers after i.v. bolus administration of 2-[F-18]FA (1.6 MBq/kg or 0.043 +/- 0.002 mCi/kg). This dose was sufficient for visualizing nAChRs in the thalamus up to 5 h after injection. There were no adverse effects associated with administration of no-carrier-added 2-[F-18]FA (1.3-10 pmol/kg). Consistent with the distribution of nAChRs in human brain, accumulated radioactivity was greatest in thalamus, intermediate in the midbrain, pons, cerebellum, and cortex; and least in white matter. As similar to90% of the injected radioactivity was eliminated via the urine (biological half-life ca. 4 h), the urinary bladder wall received the highest radiation dose. The estimate of radiation dose equivalent to the urinary bladder wall (ca. 180 +/- 30 mSv/MBq or 0.7 rem/mCi with a 2.4 h void interval) suggests that multiple studies could be performed in a single subject. The results predict that quantitative PET imaging of nAChRs in human brain with 2-[F-18]FA is feasible.

To investigate this we have examined the effect of disrupting the gene encoding the Ca(v)1.3 (alpha1D) alpha subunit of L-type Ca2+ channels on neurological function, acute nociceptive behavior, and hippocampal synaptic function in mice. Ca(V)1.3 alpha1 subunit knockout (Ca(V)1.3alpha1(-/-)) mice had relatively normal neurological function with the exception of reduced auditory evoked behavioral responses and lower body weight. Baseline thermal and mechanical thresholds were unaltered in these animals. Ca(V)1.3alpha(-/-) mice were also examined for differences in N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-dependent (100 Hz tetanization for 1 s) and NMDA receptor-independent (200 Hz in 100 muM DL-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid) long-term potentiation within the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Both NMDA receptor-dependent and NMDA receptor-independent forms of long-term potentiation were expressed normally. Radioligand binding studies revealed that the density of (+)[H-3]isradipine binding sites in brain homogenates was reduced by 20-25% in Ca(V)1.3alpha(-/-) mice, without any detectable change in Ca(V)1.2 (alpha1C) protein levels as detected using Western blot analysis. Taken together these data indicate that following loss of Ca(V)1.3alpha1 subunit expression there is sufficient residual activity of other Ca2+ channel subtypes to support NMDA receptor-independent long-term potentiation and some forms of sensory behavior/function.

The receptor-secretory mechanism has not been studied in detail. Aims: The studies reported were directed toward elucidating signal transduction/second messenger pathways within the rat submandibular gland associated with 2-thiazolylethylamine (ThEA)-induced H-1-receptor responses. Materials and methods: To assess the H-1 receptor subtype expression In the rat submandibular gland, a radioligand binding assay was performed. The study also Included inositolphosphates and cyclic GMP accumulation, protein kinase C and nitric oxide synthase activities, and amylase release. Results: The histamine H-1 receptor subtype is expressed on the rat submandibular gland with high-affinity binding sites. The ThEA effect was associated with activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, translocation of protein kinase C, stimulation of nitric oxide synthase activity and increased production of cyclic GMP. ThEA stimulation of nitric oxide synthase and cyclic GMP was blunted by agents able to interfere with calcium movilization, while a protein kinase C inhibitor was able to stimulate ThEA action. On the other hand, ThEA stimulation evoked amylase release via the H1 receptor but was not followed by the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway activation. Conclusions: These results suggest that, apart from the effect of ThEA on amylase release, it also appears to be a vasoactive chemical mediator that triggers vasodilatation, modulating the course of Inflammation.

The developmental pattern of renal AT1R in microswine, like many species, exhibited a 10-fold increase postnatally (P < 0.001), with maximal postnatal density in glomeruli and lower density AT1R in extraglomerular cortical and outer medullary sites. With aging, postnatal AT1R glomerular profiles increased in size (P < 0.001) and fractional area occupied (P < 0.04), with no change in the number per unit area. Cortical levels of AT2R by autoradiography fell with age from congruent to 5,000 fmol/g in fetal kidneys to congruent to 60 and 20% of fetal levels in neonatal and adult cortex, respectively (P < 0.0001). The pattern of AT2R binding in postnatal pig kidney mimicked that described in human and simian, but not rodent, species: dense AT2R confined to discrete cortical structures, including pre- and juxtaglomerular, but not intraglomerular, vasculature. Our results provide a quantitative assessment of ANG II receptors in developing pig kidney and document the concordance of pigs and primates in developmental regulation of renal AT1R and AT2R.

BRL37344 produced apparently biphasic concentration-relaxation curves in the urinary bladder smooth muscle contracted with carbachol (0.6 muM). The first and second phases had estimated pD(2) (-logEC(50)) values of 7.80 +/- 0.34 and 4.62 +/- 0.18, respectively (n=6). The first component of the BRL37344 concentration-response curve was not affected by propranolol (1 p,M), whereas it was inhibited by higher concentrations of the drug (10 p M or 30 muM). The second component was completely resistant to propranolol. On the other hand, BRL37344 produced monophasic concentration-relaxation of 30 mM KCl-precontracted urinary bladder smooth muscle with a pD2 value of 8.34 +/- 0.18 (n=6). Pretreatment of the urinary bladder smooth muscles with BRL37344 (30, 100 and 300RM) significantly (P<0.05) shifted the concentration-response curves for carbachol-induced contractions. In radioligand binding experiments, BRL37344 concentration-dependently displaced the specific binding of [H-3]N-methyl scopolamine to muscarinic receptors on rat urinary bladder smooth muscle membranes. Additionally, BRL37344 inhibited [H-3]N-methyl scopolamine binding to cloned human muscarinic receptors (M-1-M-5) expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. These results suggest that BRL37344 attenuates muscarinic receptor-mediated contractions through prevention of the agonists binding to their receptors, in addition to stimulation of beta(3)-adrenoceptors, in rat urinary bladder.

The compounds were evaluated for their capacity to potentiate or inhibit GABA-evoked currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing recombinant alpha1beta2gamma2 GABA(A) receptors. The benzyl, ethyl., and allyl carbamates ((R)-9a (100 muM), (+/-)-9b (100 muM), (+/-)-9c (200 muM)) stimulated GABA currents by 279 +/- 47%, 426 +/- 8%. and 765 +/- 61%, respectively, while the phenylcarboxamide (+/-)-9f (200 muM) stimulated currents by 420 +/- 33%. Concentration-response studies showed that compound 9c was approximately twice as potent in stimulating GABA currents as alpha-EMTBL (2), the most potent 3,3-dialkylbutyrolactone known to date. On the other hand, the N-sulfonyl analogues were much less active or even inhibited GABA-evoked currents. In vitro radioligand displacement studies on rat brain membranes showed that these compounds did not bind to the benzodiazepine or GABA recognition sites of the GABAA receptor. However, these compounds generally weakly displaced [S-35]-TBPS (approximately 50% displacement at 100 muM), though potencies did not correlate with GABA current potentiation. Results obtained with 0 1 and mutant alpha1beta2N265S receptors, which compared to alpha1/beta2 receptors are both much less sensitive to current stimulation produced by the anticonvulsant loreclezole, suggest that at least some of these aminobutyrolactones, (e.g., 9a, 9c), and interestingly also alpha-EMTBL, share stimulatory properties with loreclezole.

J., Matsuura, B., Dong, M., Hadac, E. M., Pinon, D. I., Feighner, S. D., Howard, A. D., and Miller, L. J. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 35518-35522). In the current work, motilin receptor constructs were prepared that included sequential deletions ranging from single residues to twelve amino acid segments throughout this 67 amino acid domain. Each construct was expressed in COS cells and characterized for motilin radioligand binding and motilin-stimulated intracellular calcium responses. The only segments that had negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity included deletion constructs DeltaCys(235), Delta179-182, and Delta241-246. Cys(235) is likely involved in the highly conserved and functionally important disulfide bond linking the first and second loops of G protein-coupled receptors. Alanine replacements for each of the amino acid residues in the other two segments revealed that the perimembranous residues at both ends of this loop, Val(179) and Leu(245) and Arg(246), were responsible for the negative impact on motilin binding and biological activity. Of note, these mutants responded normally to the non-peptidyl agonist, erythromycin. These data support important functional roles for both amino-terminal and carboxyl-terminal perimembranous regions of the second loop for responses to the natural agonist peptide, while supporting independent determinants for action of a non-peptidyl agonist ligand.

Subnanomolar concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and type C natriuretic peptide (CNP) stimulated proliferation in all four cell lines. These actions were associated with cGMP elevation and were blocked by a protein kinase G inhibitor. These data imply the involvement of guanylyl cyclase (GC)-coupled natriuretic receptors. However, higher concentrations of ANP and CNP, and low concentrations of des-[Gln(18), Ser(19), Gly(20), Leu(21) , Gly(22)]-ANP(4-23)-NH2 (desANP(4-23)) (analog for NPR-C receptor) exerted antiproliferative actions in three of the cell lines. These effects were insensitive to a protein kinase G inhibitor and to HS-142-1, suggesting that growth-inhibitory actions involved a non-GC receptor. They did not appear to involve cAMP, protein kinase X protein kinase C, or calcium mobilization but were abolished when constitutive mitogen-activated protein kinase activity was inhibited. Radioligand binding experiments revealed the presence of a uniform class of binding sites in NG108 cells and multiple binding sites in Neuro2a cells. Northern and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyses revealed differential gene expression for NPRA/B/C in NG108 and Neuro2a cells. The results indicate that natriuretic peptides stimulate neuroblastoma cell proliferation through type NPRA/B (GC) receptors. Higher concentrations of ANP and CNP exerted a mitogen-activated protein kinase-dependent antiproliferative action mediated by a non-GC receptor that interacts with desANP(4-23) with relatively high affinity.

Its potency exceeded twice that of buprenorphine. In the tail-flick test it acted as a full agonist but in the plantar test only as a partial agonist. Whereas the mu -opioid antagonists naloxone and naltrexone antagonized HS-599 antinociception the delta -opioid antagonist naltrindole and the kappa -opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine did not. 2 Unlike buprenorphine and morphine, HS-599 never induced conditioned place-preference in rats. 3 In radioligand binding assays, compared with buprenorphine HS-599 had 3 fold higher mu -opioid receptor affinity but lower delta- and kappa -opioid receptor affinity. 4 In isolated guinea-pig ileum preparations, HS-599 only partially inhibited the electrically-stimulated contraction, acting as a partial opioid agonist. When tested against the mu -opioid receptor agonist dermorphin, it behaved as a non-equilibrium antagonist. Conversely, in mouse vas deferens (rich in delta -opioid receptors) and rabbit vas deferens preparations (rich in kappa -Opioid receptors) HS-599 acted as a pure equilibrium antagonist, shifting the log-concentration-response curves of the delta -opioid agonist deltorphin I and the kappa -Opioid agonist U-69593 to the right. 5 In conclusion, HS-599 is a novel buprenorphine derivative with higher affinity, selectivity and potency than the parent compound, for mu -opioid receptors. It produces intense and long-lasting antinociception and does not induce place-preference in rats.

We now show that PAC(1) gene expression is also present in neonatal rats in the ventricular and subventricular zones and in the optic chiasm, areas that are rich in oligodendrocyte (OL) progenitors (OLP). Because actions of PACAP on OLP have not been reported, we examined the effects of PACAP on the proliferation of purified OLP in culture and on myelinogenesis in cerebellar slices. Northern analyses on total RNA from purified glial cell subtypes revealed an abundant 7 kb hybridizing transcript in OLP, which was confirmed to correspond to the PAC1 receptor by reverse transcription-PCR. The presence of this receptor was also corroborated by radioligand binding and cAMP assay. In cultured OL, receptor density decreased during maturation but was partially counterbalanced by the appearance of sites that bound both PACAP and the related peptide vasoactive intestinal peptide. PACAP increased DNA synthesis in OLP cultures almost twofold and increased the bromodeoxyuridine-labeling index in O4-positive OLP. PACAP treatment also resulted in decreased sulfate incorporation into sulfatide in cultures of differentiating OL. The PACAP effect on sulfatide synthesis was fully reproduced in a cerebellar explant model. These findings indicate that PACAP may act at two stages during OL development to (1) stimulate proliferation and (2) delay maturation and/or myelinogenesis.

To investigate whether there are age-associated changes in dopamine D2 and D3 receptor subtypes (D2/3Rs) outside the striatum, a D2/3R selective high-affinity radioligand [C-11]FLB 457 was used in positron emission tomography (PET) examinations for 24 normal healthy male subjects (age range 19-74 years). Significant age-related declines of D2/3Rs were detected in all the brain regions studied: the anterior cingulate cortex (decline of 13% per increase of a decade in age, P < 0.001), the frontal cortex (11%, P < 0.001), the lateral temporal cortex (10%, P < 0.001), the hippocampus (10%, P < 0.01), the medial temporal cortex (9%, P < 0.001), the amygdala (7%, P < 0,01), the medial thalamus (6%, P < 0.001) and the lateral thalamus (5%, P < 0.01). The rate of D2/3R decline was significantly faster in the frontal cortex as compared to the medial temporal cortex (P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected) and as compared to the medial thalamus (P < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). These results indicate that the previously demonstrated age-related decline in striatal dopamine D2 receptors extends to several extrastriatal regions in normal human males. Further, the rate of D2/3R decline may be faster in the frontal cortex as compared to the temporal and thalamic regions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

To shed more light on the biological effects of these compounds, we studied in vitro receptor binding of Delta 10-THC isomers at cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors.Materials and Methods: We first optimized and simplified catalytic synthesis of trans- and cis-Delta 10-THC to allow their safe and cheap large-scale synthesis. In our synthesis, BuLi was replaced with (KOBu)-Bu-t, and DMSO/anisole or NEt3/heptane solvent systems were used instead of HMPA/toluene. Single crystal X-ray analysis confirmed the structure of both isomers and the configuration of their chiral centers.Results: In the radioligand replacement assay, both isomers showed strong affinity toward the CB1 receptor, with IC50=29.1 nM for the trans isomer and IC50=294.2 nM for the cis counterpart. However, the IC50 values were significantly higher than that of Delta 9-THC (2.1 nM), a naturally occurring psychoactive component of cannabis sativa, suggesting a lower affinity of Delta 10-THCs toward this receptor. In function assays, in contrast to Delta 9-THC, both isomers failed to show any agonist properties at concentrations up to 10 mu M suggesting a lack of THC-like psychoactivity for trans- and cis-Delta 10-THC.Conclusions: Our results established Delta 10-THC isomers among antagonists of the CB1 receptor as both cis and trans isomers antagonized CP55,490 with IC50=460 nM for trans and IC50=1040 nM for cis. This functional property has not been previously observed for any other THC isomers.

Expanding the apelin receptor pharmacological toolbox using novel fluorescent ligands	FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY			English	Article						GPCR; apelin receptor; apelin; elabela; toddler; fluorescent ligand; stem cells; cardiovascular; kidney	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ENDOGENOUS LIGAND; ORPHAN RECEPTOR; NITRIC-OXIDE; APJ; ELABELA; PROBES; ELABELA/TODDLER; FRAGMENT	IntroductionThe apelin receptor binds two distinct endogenous peptides, apelin and ELA, which act in an autocrine/paracrine manner to regulate the human cardiovascular system. As a class A GPCR, targeting the apelin receptor is an attractive therapeutic strategy. With improvements in imaging techniques, and the stability and brightness of dyes, fluorescent ligands are becoming increasingly useful in studying protein targets. Here, we describe the design and validation of four novel fluorescent ligands; two based on [Pyr1]apelin-13 (apelin488 and apelin647), and two based on ELA-14 (ELA488 and ELA647). MethodsFluorescent ligands were pharmacologically assessed using radioligand and functional in vitro assays. Apelin647 was validated in high content imaging and internalisation studies, and in a clinically relevant human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte model. Apelin488 and ELA488 were used to visualise apelin receptor binding in human renal tissue. ResultsAll four fluorescent ligands retained the ability to bind and activate the apelin receptor and, crucially, triggered receptor internalisation. In high content imaging studies, apelin647 bound specifically to CHO-K1 cells stably expressing apelin receptor, providing proof-of-principle for a platform that could screen novel hits targeting this GPCR. The ligand also bound specifically to endogenous apelin receptor in stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. Apelin488 and ELA488 bound specifically to apelin receptor, localising to blood vessels and tubules of the renal cortex. DiscussionOur data indicate that the described novel fluorescent ligands expand the pharmacological toolbox for studying the apelin receptor across multiple platforms to facilitate drug discovery.

Unfortunately, the available pharmacotherapeutic options have limited effectiveness. Therefore, developing new drug candidates remains very important. We selected six novel arylpiperazine alkyl derivatives of salicylamide to investigate their cardiovascular effects. Having in mind the beneficial role of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors in restoring sinus rhythm and regulating blood pressure, first, using radioligand binding assays, we evaluated the affinity of the tested compounds for alpha-adrenergic receptors. Our experiments revealed their high to moderate affinity for alpha(1)- but not alpha(2)-adrenoceptors. Next, we aimed to determine the antiarrhythmic potential of novel derivatives in rat models of arrhythmia induced by adrenaline, calcium chloride, or aconitine. All compounds showed potent prophylactic antiarrhythmic activity in the adrenaline-induced arrhythmia model and no effects in calcium chloride- or aconitine-induced arrhythmias. Moreover, the tested compounds demonstrated therapeutic antiarrhythmic activity, restoring a normal sinus rhythm immediately after the administration of the arrhythmogen adrenaline. Notably, none of the tested derivatives affected the normal electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters in rodents, which excludes their proarrhythmic potential. Finally, all tested compounds decreased blood pressure in normotensive rats and reversed the pressor response to methoxamine, suggesting that their hypotensive mechanism of action is connected with the blockade of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Our results confirm the antiarrhythmic and hypotensive activities of novel arylpiperazine derivatives and encourage their further investigation as model structures for potential drugs.

We developed Zr-89-matuzumab as a PET probe for diagnosis/monitoring of response to treatment of a noncompeting anti-EGFR nimotuzumab antibody drug conjugate (ADC) using mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) xenografts. We developed Zr-89-matuzumab and performed quality control in EGFR-positive DLD-1 cells. The K-D of matuzumab, DFO-matuzumab and Zr-89-matuzumab in DLD-1 cells was 5.9, 6.2 and 3 nM, respectively. A competitive radioligand binding assay showed that Zr-89-matuzumab and nimotuzumab bound to noncompeting epitopes of EGFR. MicroPET/CT imaging and biodistribution of Zr-89-matuzumab in mice bearing EGFR-positive xenografts (HT29, DLD-1 and MDA-MB-231) showed high uptake that was blocked with pre-dosing with matuzumab but not with the noncompeting binder nimotuzumab. We evaluated nimotuzumab-PEG(6)-DM1 ADC in CRC cells. IC50 of nimotuzumab-PEG(6)-DM1 in SNU-C2B, DLD-1 and SW620 cells was dependent on EGFR density and was up to five-fold lower than that of naked nimotuzumab. Mice bearing the SNU-C2B xenograft were treated using three 15 mg/kg doses of nimotuzumab-PEG(6)-DM1, and Zr-89-matuzumab microPET/CT was used to monitor the response to treatment. Treatment resulted in complete remission of the SNU-C2B tumor in 2/3 mice. Matuzumab and nimotuzumab are noncompeting and can be used simultaneously.

Nowadays, simple FS have a good prognosis but there is controversy about the outcome of prolonged FS. In a previous work using an animal model of prolonged FS, we showed that hiperthermia-induced seizures (HIS) evoked fine motor coordination impairment and gait disturbances in adolescent rats in a process in which seemed to be involved modulation of the cerebellar adenosinergic system. The aim of the present work was to verify whether the effect was maintained in adulthood. To this end, neonatal rats (PD 12) were exposed to HIS and after 48 days (PD 60) they were assayed on balance beam and footprint tests. Animals were sacrificed 53 days after HIS and adenosine A1 and A2A receptor signalling pathways were studied in cerebellar plasma membranes by using radioligand binding assays and by measuring the activities of 5 '-nucleotidase and adenylyl cyclase. Results obtained revealed that adult rats exposed to HIS showed gait disturbances and motor impairments. Besides, animals exposed to hyperthermic insult showed an increase in adenosine A2A receptor functionality and 5 '-nucleotidase activity. Surprisingly, the functionality of the adenosine A1 receptor resulted significantly changed causing stimulation instead of inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. These results showed that the effect of prolonged FS at the early age also persist in adulthood suggesting on must pay attention to FS in children.	[Crespo, M.; Leon-Navarro, D.

In vitro binding affinity vs. in vivo site occupancy: A PET study of four diastereomers of dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ) in monkey brain	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Dihydrotetrabenazine; Stereoisomer; Occupancy; Binding affinity		Introduction: In vivo imaging methods such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) can be used to examine the relationship between in vitro binding affinity and in vivo occupancy of binding sites in the brain for new drug candidates. In this study, PET imaging in monkey brain was used to evaluate that correlation for a set of four diastereomers of the compound dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZ), the pharmacologically active metabolite of the drug tetrabenazine. Methods: PET studies of DTBZ diastereomers were completed in a single monkey brain. In vivo occupancies (ED50) were estimated using multiple drug doses and the vesicular monoamine transporter 2 specific radioligand (+)-alpha-[C-11] DTBZ, employing a test-retest sequence of control PET scan, drug administration and a second PET scan completed on a single day. Results: DTBZ has three chiral carbon centers and eight possible stereoisomers, and in vivo occupancy of the target site VMAT2 was observed only for the four diastereomers of DTBZ having the 11bR absolute configuration. The estimated in vivo occupancies (ED50 values from 0.023 to >3.15 mg/kg) correlated well (R-2 = 0.95) with the in vitro binding affinities (K-i values of 4 to 600 nM for the VMAT2), and an even better correlation (R-2 = 0.99) was found for the three isomers with in vitro binding affinities <100 nM. Conclusions: If the physiochemical (MW, log P, pKa) or physiological (metabolism, transport, protein binding) properties of a set of drug stereoisomers are considered similar, the binding affinities determined from in vitro assays may predict the in vivo occupancies of the target binding site in the monkey brain.

Although, it is no longer on the list of minerals necessary for the proper functioning of the human body, and its pharmacological effect is still under discussion. One of the purposes of Cr(III) administration is to use it in patients with mood disorders and it is strictly related to its pharmacological, not dietary effect. This is because its high doses are necessary to obtain the results and additionally, no deficiencies in human population have been noted. In this study, the affinity of chromium(III) to selected receptors and transporters in the rat brain was evaluated, and the effect of the 14-day administration of this metal was assessed on the density of selected receptors. All analyses were performed in vitro using radioligand binding assays, and the results indicated lack of affinity to beta(1)and alpha(1)receptors and serotonin transporter (SERT), furthermore very weak affinity to the 5-HT(1A)receptor (30% inhibition at 10(-4)and 10(-5) M). Analysis of the alpha(1)and beta(1)adrenergic receptor density indicated lack of any adaptive effects after 14 days of Cr(III) administration through intraperitoneal injections (doses 6 and 12 mg/kg). The antidepressant activity of chromium(III) indicated in clinical trials concerned patients with atypical, seasonal, or dystonic symptoms. This effect, as it seems based on the presented results, does not depend on direct affinity to serotonin receptors and transporter nor is the result of adaptive changes in the adrenoreceptor system.

Isomerization of Asp7 in Beta-Amyloid Enhances Inhibition of the α7 Nicotinic Receptor and Promotes Neurotoxicity	CELLS			English	Article						amyloid-beta; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; modifications; Alzheimer's disease; neurotoxicity; calcium imaging; radioligand analysis; aspartate isomerization	POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; AGONIST-BINDING; PEPTIDE; CALCIUM; MECHANISM; PROTEIN; ACCUMULATION; A-BETA(1-42)	Cholinergic dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be mediated by the neuronal alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha 7nAChR). Beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) binds to the alpha 7nAChR, disrupting the receptor's function and causing neurotoxicity. In vivo not only A beta but also its modified forms can drive AD pathogenesis. One of these forms, iso-A beta (containing an isomerized Asp7 residue), shows an increased neurotoxicity in vitro and stimulates amyloidogenesis in vivo. We suggested that such effects of iso-A beta are alpha 7nAChR-dependent. Here, using calcium imaging and electrophysiology, we found that iso-A beta is a more potent inhibitor of the alpha 7nAChR-mediated calcium current than unmodified A beta. However, Asp7 isomerization eliminated the ability of A beta to decrease the alpha 7nAChR levels. These data indicate differences in the interaction of the peptides with the alpha 7nAChR, which we demonstrated using computer modeling. Neither A beta nor iso-A beta competed with I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin for binding to the orthosteric site of the receptor, suggesting the allosteric binging mode of the peptides. Further we found that increased neurotoxicity of iso-A beta was mediated by the alpha 7nAChR. Thus, the isomerization of Asp7 enhances the inhibitory effect of A beta on the functional activity of the alpha 7nAChR, which may be an important factor in the disruption of the cholinergic system in AD.

Edward			Insight Into Molecular Determinants of T3 vs T4 Recognition From Mutations in Thyroid Hormone Receptor α and β	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ENDOCRINOLOGY & METABOLISM			English	Article							RESISTANCE; GENE; TRIIODOTHYRONINE; PHENOTYPES; DOMAIN	Context: The two major forms of circulating thyroid hormones (THs) are T3 and T4. T3 is regarded as the biologically active hormone because it binds to TH receptors (TRs) with greater affinity than T4. However, it is currently unclear what structural mechanisms underlie this difference in affinity. Objective: Prompted by the identification of a novel M256T mutation in a resistance to TH (RTH)alpha patient, we investigated Met256 in TR alpha 1 and the corresponding residue (Met310) in TR beta 1, residues previously predicted by crystallographic studies in discrimination of T3 vs T4. Methods: Clinical characterization of the RTH alpha patient and molecular studies (in silico protein modeling, radioligand binding, transactivation, and receptor-cofactor studies) were performed. Results: Structural modeling of the TR alpha 1-M256T mutant showed that distortion of the hydrophobic niche to accommodate the outer ring of ligand was more pronounced for T3 than T4, suggesting that this substitution has little impact on the affinity for T4. In agreement with the model, TR alpha 1-M256T selectively reduced the affinity for T3. Also, unlike other naturally occurring TR alpha mutations, TR alpha 1-M256T had a differential impact on T3- vs T4-dependent transcriptional activation. TR alpha 1-M256A and TR beta 1-M310T mutants exhibited similar discordance for T3 vs T4. Conclusions: Met256-TR alpha 1/Met310-TR beta 1 strongly potentiates the affinity of TRs for T3, thereby largely determining that T3 is the bioactive hormone rather than T4. These observations provide insight into the molecular basis for underlying the different affinity of TRs for T3 vs T4, delineating a fundamental principle of TH signaling.

J	Dean, B; Duncan, C; Gibbons, A				Dean, Brian; Duncan, Clare; Gibbons, Andrew			Changes in levels of cortical metabotropic glutamate 2 receptors with gender and suicide but not psychiatric diagnoses	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article							MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; GENE-EXPRESSION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BINDING; PROTEIN	Background: We previously reported that, compared to controls, there are lower levels of [H-3] LY341495 binding to metabotropic 2/3 receptors (GRM2/3) in Brodmann's area (BA) 24, but not 17 or 46, from subjects with major depressive disorders (MDD) but not bipolar disorders (BD) or schizophrenia. To be able to better interpret these data we have now measured levels of GRM2 in two of these cortical regions. Methods: Using a rabbit anti-metabotropic GRM2 monoclonal antibody with Western blotting we measured levels of GRM2 in BA 24 and 46 from subjects with MDD, BD, schizophrenia and controls (n = 15 per group). Results: Compared to controls, levels of GRM2, normalised to beta-actin, did not differ in BA 24 or 46 from subjects with MDD, BD or schizophrenia (p from 0.36 to 0.79). Levels of GRM2 in BA 46, but not BA 24, were significantly higher in males compared to females (p < 0.01) and in suicide completers (p < 0.01) compare to death by other causes. Limitations: Our cohort sizes, whilst being comparable to many postmortem CNS studies, are relatively low. Conclusions: Our data suggests levels of GRM2 are not altered in two cortical regions from subjects with mood disorders or schizophrenia. Given we have found lower levels of [H-3] LY341495 binding to GRM2/3 in BA 24 from subjects with MDD, our new data argues the lower levels of radioligand binding was due to lower levels of GRM3. Our data also suggests that glutamatergic activity through GRM2 in BA 46 may differ with gender and suicide ideation.

Biodistribution and Radiation Dosimetry of 124I-DPA-713, a PET Radiotracer for Macrophage-Associated Inflammation	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						pyrazolopyrimidine; macrophage; DPA-713; sarcoidosis; PET/CT	PROTEIN 18 KDA; RADIOIODINATED DPA-713; MICE; TSPO; ATHEROSCLEROSIS; NANOPARTICLES; INDIVIDUALS; EXPRESSION; CANCER; LOX-1	Whole-body PET/CT was performed using 124I-DPA-713, a radioligand for the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), to determine biodistribution and radiation dosimetry. Methods: Healthy subjects aged 18-65 y underwent whole-body PET/CT either at 4, 24, and 48 h or at 24, 48, and 72 h after intravenous injection of 124I-DPA713. Time-activity curves were generated and used to calculate organ time-integrated activity coefficients for each subject. The resulting time-integrated activity coefficients provided input data for calculation of organ absorbed doses and effective dose for each subject using OLINDA. Subjects were genotyped for the TSPO polymorphism rs6971, and plasma protein binding of 124I-DPA-713 was measured. Results: Three male and 3 female adults with a mean age of 40 +/- 19 y were imaged. The mean administered activity and mass were 70.5 +/- 5.1 MBq (range, 62.4-78.1 MBq) and 469 +/- 34 ng (range, 416-520 ng), respectively. There were no adverse or clinically detectable pharmacologic effects in any of the 6 subjects. No changes in vital signs, laboratory values, or electrocardiograms were observed. 124I-DPA-713 cleared rapidly (4 h after injection) from the lungs, with hepatic elimination and localization to the gastrointestinal tract. The mean effective dose over the 6 subjects was 0.459 +/- 0.127 mSv/MBq, with the liver being the dose-limiting organ (0.924 +/- 0.501 mGy/MBq). The percentage of free radiotracer in blood was approximately 30% at 30 and 60 min after injection. Conclusion: 124I-DPA-713 clears rapidly from the lungs, with predominantly hepatic elimination, and is safe and well tolerated in healthy adults.

The new compounds represent 1,3-dipropyl- and 1,3-dibutyl-pyrimido[2,1-f]purinedione-9-ethylphenoxy derivatives including a CH2CONH linker between the (CH2)(2)-amino group and the phenoxy moiety. A synthetic strategy to obtain the final products was developed involving solvent-free microwave irradiation. The new compounds were evaluated for their adenosine receptor (AR) affinities. The most potent derivatives contained a terminal tertiary amino function. Compounds with nanomolar AR affinities and at the same time high water-solubility were obtained (A(1) (K-i = 24-605 nM), A(2A) (K-i = 242-1250 nM), A(2B) (K-i = 66-911 nM) and A(3) (K-i = 155-1000 nM)). 2-(4-(2-(1,3-Dibutyl-2,4-dioxo-1,2,3,4,7,8-hexahydropyrimido[2,1-f]purin-9(6H)-yl)ethyl)phenoxy)-N-(3-(diethylamino)propyl)acetamide (27) and the corresponding N-(2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl)acetamide (36) were found to be the most potent antagonists of the present series. While 27 showed CYP inhibition and moderate metabolic stability, 36 was found to possess suitable properties for in vivo applications. In an attempt to explain the affinity data for the synthesized compounds, molecular modeling and docking studies were performed using homology models of A(1) and A(2A) adenosine receptors. The potent compound 36 was used as an example for discussion of the possible ligand-protein interactions. Moreover, the compounds showed high water-solubility indicating that the approach of introducing a basic side chain was successful for the class of generally poorly soluble AR antagonists.

Dileep			Radiosynthesis and Evaluation of [<SUP>11</SUP>C]HD-800, a High Affinity Brain Penetrant PET Tracer for Imaging Microtubules	ACS MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY LETTERS			English	Article						Microtubule; brain; radiotracer; cytoskeleton	TARGETING AGENTS; CYTOSKELETON; SCHIZOPHRENIA; INDUCTION	Microtubules (MTs) are highly abundant throughout the cytoskeleton, and their dysfunction is implicated in the pathogenesis of malignancies, various neurodegenerative disorders, and brain injuries. Validated radiotracers reported so far for MTs are [C-11]paclitaxel, [F-18]fluoropaclitaxel, and [C-11]docetaxel; however, they are well-characterized substrates of efflux transporters and consequently have poor uptake into the brain due to minimal blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. PET imaging of MT expression requires radiolabeled BBB penetrating MT ligands, and it may offer a direct and more sensitive approach for early diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and treatment effects in brain diseases and assessing the clinical potential of targeted therapeutics and treatments. We have identified N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-5dimethylfuro[2,3-d]pyrimidin-4-amine (HD-800) as a high affinity and selective colchicine site tubuline inhibitor amenable to radiolabel with C-11, a positron emitting isotope. HD-800 and desmethyl-HD-800 were synthesized in one step with 75% and 80% yields respectively from commercial synthons. The radiosynthesis of [C-11]HD-800 was achieved in 45 5% yield at EOS. Ex vivo biodistribution binding data of [C-11]HD-800 indicate that the radioligand penetrated the BBB and it was retained in brain with 75% specific binding. Apart from the brain, specific binding was observed in muscle (55%), heart (50%), lungs (43%), blood (37%), and pancreas (30%). MicroPET imaging in mice showed excellent binding in brain that was blocked by preadministration of unlabeled HD-800 and a colchicine site binding MT ligand MPC-6827. The above results indicate that [C-11]HD-800 may be a suitable PET ligand for the in vivo quantification of MT inside and outside the brain.

High brain serotonin levels in migraine between attacks: A 5-HT<sub>4</sub> receptor binding PET study	NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Headache; Pain; Neuroimaging; Brain; Serotonergic mechanisms	EVOKED CORTICAL POTENTIALS; HEADACHE; HABITUATION; MECHANISMS; DEPENDENCE; INCREASE; IMPACT; C-11	Migraine has been hypothesized to be a syndrome of chronic low serotonin (5-HT) levels, but investigations of brain 5-HT levels have given equivocal results. Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the 5-HT4 receptor as a proxy for brain 5-HT levels. Given that the 5-HT4 receptor is inversely related to brain 5-HT levels, we hypothesized that between attacks migraine patients would have higher 5-HT4 receptor binding compared to controls. Eighteen migraine patients without aura (migraine free> 48 h), and 16 age-and sex-matched controls underwent PET scans after injection of [C-11] SB207145, a specific 5-HT4 receptor radioligand. An investigator blinded to group calculated a neocortical mean [11C] SB207145 binding potential (BPND). Three migraine patients reported a migraine attack within 48 h after the scan and were excluded from the primary analysis. Comparing 15 migraine patients and 16 controls, we found that migraine patients have significantly lower neocortical 5-HT4 receptor binding than controls (0.60 +/- 0.09 vs. 0.67 +/- 0.05, p=.024), corrected for 5-HTTLPR genotype, sex and age. We found no association between 5-HT4 receptor binding and attack frequency, years with migraine or time since last migraine attack. Our finding of lower 5-HT4 receptor binding in migraine patients is suggestive of higher brain 5-HT levels. This is in contrast with the current belief that migraine is associated with low brain 5-HT levels. High brain 5-HT levels may represent a trait of the migraine brain or it could be a consequence of migraine attacks.

For the quantitative assessment of tau deposits in the brain, it is important that the radioactive metabolite does not enter the brain and that it does not bind to tau fibrils. The purpose of the study was to identify a radiolabeled metabolite of F-18-THK5351 in blood samples from human subjects and to characterize its pharmacological properties. Venous blood samples were collected from three human subjects after injection of F-18-THK5351 and the plasma metabolite was measured by high performance thin layer chromatography. In addition, mass spectrometry analysis and enzymatic assays were used to identify this metabolite. Mice were used to investigate the blood-brain barrier permeability of the radioactive metabolite. Furthermore, the binding ability of the metabolite to tau aggregates was evaluated using autoradiography and binding assays using human brain samples. About 13 % of the unmetabolized radiotracer was detectable in human plasma at 60 min following the injection of F-18-THK5351. The isolated radiometabolite of F-18-THK5351 was the sulphoconjugate of THK5351. This metabolite could be produced in vitro by incubating THK5351 with liver but not brain homogenates. The metabolite did not penetrate the blood-brain barrier in mice, and exhibited little binding to tau protein aggregates in post-mortem human brain samples. These results suggest that the sole metabolite detectable in plasma seems to be generated outside the brain and does not cross into the brain, which does not affect quantitative analysis of PET images.

Present study was conducted to determine the effects of centhaquin in a rat model of postoperative pain. Involvement of opioid, and adrenergic receptors was assessed by pretreating rats with antagonists at the opioid (naloxone), alpha(2)-(atipamezole) or alpha(2B)-(imiloxan) adrenergic receptors. Postoperative pain was induced by hind paw plantar incision in male Sprague Dawley rats. Antihyperalgesic effects were determined by measurement of paw withdrawal latencies and withdrawal force, using dynamic von Frey filaments; attenuation of non-evoked guarding was measured by assigning pain scores to spontaneous behaviors. Rotarod test was used to determine motor impairment. Animals received saline, centhaquin or antagonist plus centhaquin. Centhaquin produced dose-dependent antihyperalgesic effect and attenuation of non-evoked guarding behavior, versus saline treated rats (P < 0.05). Naloxone partially blocked while atipamezole and imiloxan significantly reversed centhaquin's antihyperalgesic effects (P < 0.05). Attenuation of non-evoked guarding behavior was also blocked, but was not statistically significant. Imiloxan produced a greater block compared to atipamezole while naloxone had no significant effect. Rotarod testing indicated that centhaquin did not cause motor impairment. This is the first report demonstrating centhaquin antinociception in the rat postoperative pain model. Opioid, alpha(2) adrenergic, and particularly a2B adrenergic receptors are involved in mediating antihyperalgesia while attenuation of non-evoked guarding is mediated by alpha(2B)/alpha(2) adrenergic receptors. Centhaquin could be an effective non-sedating alternative in treating postoperative pain in ambulatory surgeries. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This research concept is being applied to define target populations for clinical drug development. In a prospective community-recruited cohort of cognitively intact older adults, we compared two amyloid imaging markers within subjects: F-18-flutemetamol and C-11-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB). Methods In 32 community-recruited cognitively intact older adults aged between 65 and 80 years, we determined the concordance between binary classification based on F-18-flutemetamol versus C-11-PIB according to semiquantitative assessment (standardized uptake value ratio in composite cortical volume, SUVRcomp) and, alternatively, according to visual reads. We also determined the correlation between F-18-flutemetamol and C-11-PIB SUVR and evaluated how this was affected by the reference region chosen (cerebellar grey matter versus pons) and the use of partial volume correction (PVC) in this population. Results Binary classification based on semiquantitative assessment was concordant between F-18-flutemetamol and C-11-PIB in 94 % of cases. Concordance of blinded binary visual reads between tracers was 84 %. The Spearman correlation between F-18-flutemetamol and C-11-PIB SUVRcomp with cerebellar grey matter as reference region was 0.84, with a slope of 0.98. Correlations in neocortical regions were significantly lower with the pons as reference region. PVC improved the correlation in striatum and medial temporal cortex. Conclusion For the definition of preclinical AD based on F-18-flutemetamol, concordance with C-11-PIB was highest using semiquantitative assessment with cerebellar grey matter as reference region.

A prospective investigation of 24 PD patients, 16 APS patients and 15 patients with non-parkinsonian syndromes was performed during an 18-month period. Single photon emission computed tomography with the presynaptic radioligand I-123-FP-CIT (DaTSCAN (R)) and olfactory testing with the Brief 12-item Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) were performed in all patients. DaTSCAN was analysed semi-quantitatively, by calculating two different striatal uptake ratios, and visually according to a predefined ranking scale. B-SIT score was significantly lower for PD patients, but not significantly different between APS and non-parkinsonism. The visual assessment of DaTSCAN had higher sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy compared to olfactory testing. Most PD patients (75 %) had visually predominant dopamine depletion in putamen, while most APS patients (56 %) had visually severe dopamine depletion both in putamen and in caudate nucleus. The combination of DaTSCAN and B-SIT led to a higher rate of correctly classified patients. Olfactory testing can distinguish PD from non-parkinsonism, but not PD from APS or APS from non-parkinsonism. DaTSCAN is more efficient than olfactory testing and can be valuable in differentiating PD from APS. However, combining olfactory testing and DaTSCAN imaging has a higher predictive value than these two methods separately.

Examples from studies of receptor occupancy using PET and dose finding for neuropathic pain treatment	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOKINETICS AND PHARMACODYNAMICS			English	Article							EXPERIMENT DESIGN; IN-VIVO; BINDING; MODELS; TRIAL	An understanding of the relationship between drug exposure and response is a fundamental basis for any dosing recommendation. We investigate optimal dose-selection for two different types of studies, a receptor occupancy study assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) and a dose-finding study in neuropathic pain treatment. For the PET-study, an inhibitory E-max model describes the relationship between drug exposure and displacement of a radioligand from specific receptors in the brain. The model has a mechanistic basis in the law of mass action and the affinity parameter (Ki (PL) ) is of primary interest. For optimization of the neuropathic pain study, the model is empirical and the exposure response curve itself is of primary interest. An alternative parameterization of the sigmoid Emax model was therefore used where the plasma concentration corresponding to the minimum relevant efficacy was estimated as a parameter. Optimal design methodology was applied using the D-optimal criterion as well as the Ds-optimal criterion where parameters of interest were defined. For the PET-study it was shown that the precision of Ki (PL) can be improved by inclusion of brain regions with both high and low receptor density and that the need for high doses is reduced when a brain region with low receptor density is included in the analysis. In the case of the neuropathic pain study it was shown that a Ds-optimal study design using the reparameterized Emax model can improve the precision in the minimum effective dose compared to a D-optimal design.

Dissection was used to determine the distribution of [F-18]FEBMP in mice, while small-animal PET and metabolite analysis were used for a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. [F-18]FEBMP showed high radioactivity uptake in mouse peripheral organs enriched with TSPO, and relatively high initial brain uptake (2.67 +/- 0.12% ID/g). PET imaging revealed an increased accumulation of radioactivity in the infarcted striatum, with a maximum ratio of 3.20 +/- 0.12, compared to non-injured striatum. Displacement with specific TSPO ligands lowered the accumulation levels in infarcts to those on the contralateral side. This suggests that the increased accumulation reflected TPSO-specific binding of [F-18]FEBMP in vivo. Using a simplified reference tissue model, the binding potential on the infarcted area was 2.72 +/- 0.27. Metabolite analysis in brain tissues showed that 83.2 +/- 7.4% and 76.4 +/- 2.1% of radioactivity was from intact [F-18]FEBMP at 30 and 60 min, respectively, and that this ratio was higher than in plasma (8.6 +/- 1.9% and 3.9 +/- 1.1%, respectively). In vitro autoradiography on postmortem human brains showed that TSPO rs6971 polymorphism did not affect binding sites for [F-18]FEBMP. These findings suggest that [F-18]FEBMP is a promising new tool for visualization of neuroinflammation.

Novel treatments for type-2 diabetes mellitus(2) are therefore possible by targeting hGPR40 with partial or full agonists. TAK-875, or fasiglifam, is an orally available, potent and selective partial agonist(3) of hGPR40 receptor, which reached phase III clinical trials for the potential treatment of type-2 diabetes mellitus(4). Data from clinical studies indicate that TAK-875, which is anago-allosteric modulator of hGPR40 (ref. 3), demonstrates improved glycaemic control and low hypoglycaemic risk in diabetic patients(5). Here we report the crystal structure of hGPR40 receptor bound to TAK-875 at 2.3 angstrom resolution. The co-complex structure reveals a unique binding mode of TAK-875 and suggests that entry to the non-canonical binding pocket most probably occurs via the lipid bilayer. The atomic details of the extensive charge network in the ligand binding pocket reveal additional interactions not identified in previous studies and contribute to a clear understanding of TAK-875 binding to the receptor. The hGPR40-TAK-875 structure also provides insights into the plausible binding of multiple ligands to the receptor, which has been observed in radioligand binding(6) and Ca2+ influx assay studies(3). Comparison of the transmembrane helix architecture with other G-protein-coupled receptors suggests that the crystallized TAK-875-bound hGPR40 complex is in an inactive-like state.

Herein we report radiosynthesis and validation of the phenyltropane F-18-FP-CMT. Dynamic PET recordings were obtained for F-18-FP-CMT in six untreated rats, and six rats pretreated with the high-affinity DAT ligand GBR 12909; mean parametric maps of binding potential (BPND) relative to the cerebellum reference region, and maps of total distribution volume (V-T) relative to the metabolite-corrected arterial input were produced. F-18-FP-CMT BPND maps showed peak values of 4 in the striatum, versus similar to 0.4 in the vicinity of the substantia nigra. Successive truncation of the PET recordings indicated that stable BPND estimates could be obtained with recordings lasting only 45 minutes, reflecting rapid kinetics of F-18-FP-CMT. Pretreatment with GBR 12909 reduced the striatal binding by 72% to 76%. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed rapid metabolism of F-18-FP-CMT to a single, non-brain penetrant hydrophilic metabolite. Total distribution of volume calculated relative to the metabolite-corrected arterial input was 4.4 mL/g in the cerebellum. The pharmacological selectivity of F-18-FP-CMT, rapid kinetic profile, and lack of problematic metabolites constitute optimal properties for quantitation of DAT in rat, and may also predict applicability in human PET studies.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging Initi	Amyloid PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease: a comparison of three radiotracers	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Amyloid; Alzheimer's disease; PET imaging; Neurology	PITTSBURGH COMPOUND-B; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; F 18; BETA; FLORBETAPIR; F-18-FLUTEMETAMOL; DEPOSITION; RADIOLIGAND; VALIDATION; DEMENTIA	Purpose The increasing use of amyloid PET in Alzheimer's disease research and clinical trials has motivated efforts to standardize methodology. We compared retention of the C-11 radiotracer Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and that of two F-18 amyloid radiotracers (florbetapir and flutemetamol) using two study populations. We also examined the feasibility of converting between tracer-specific measures, using PiB as the common link between the two F-18 tracers. Methods One group of 40 subjects underwent PiB and flutemetamol imaging sessions and a separate group of 32 subjects underwent PiB and florbetapir imaging sessions. We compared cortical and white matter retention for each F-18 tracer relative to that of PiB, as well as retention in several reference regions and image analysis methods. Correlations between tracer pairs were used to convert tracer-specific threshold values for amyloid positivity between tracers. Results Cortical retention for each pair of tracers was strongly correlated regardless of reference region (PiB-flutemetamol, rho = 0.84-0.99; PiB-florbetapir, rho = 0.83-0.97) and analysis method (rho = 0.90-0.99). Compared to PiB, flutemetamol had higher white matter retention, while florbetapir had lower cortical retention. Two previously established independent thresholds for amyloid positivity were highly consistent when values were converted between tracer pairs. Conclusion Despite differing white and grey matter retention characteristics, cortical retention for each F-18 tracer was highly correlated with that of PiB, enabling conversion of thresholds across tracer measurement scales with a high level of internal consistency. Standardization of analysis methods and measurement scales may facilitate the comparison of amyloid PET data obtained using different tracers.	[Landau, S. M.; Jagust, W.

We sought to determine whether amyloid imaging measures of AD are affected by concurrent pathologies. Thirty-eight clinically and pathologically defined AD and 17 nondemented patients with quantitative florbetapir F-18 (18F-AV-45) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging during life and postmortem histological beta-amyloid quantification and neuropathologic examination were assessed. AD patients were divided on the basis of concurrent pathologies, including those with Lewy bodies (LBs) (n = 21), white matter rarefaction (n = 27), severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n = 11), argyrophilic grains (n = 5), and TAR DNA binding protein-43 inclusions (n = 18). Many patients exhibited more than 1 type of concurrent pathology. The ratio of cortical to cerebellar amyloid imaging signal (SUVr) and immunohistochemical beta-amyloid load were analyzed in 6 cortical regions of interest. All AD subgroups had strong and significant correlations between SUVr and histological beta-amyloid measures (p mu 0.001). All AD subgroups had significantly greater amyloid measures versus nondemented patients, and mean amyloid measures did not significantly differ between AD subgroups. When comparing AD cases with and without each pathology, AD cases with LBs had significantly lower SUVr measures versus AD cases without LBs (p = 0.002); there were no other paired comparison differences. These findings indicate that florbetapir-PET imaging is not confounded by neuropathological heterogeneity within AD.

It is not well known regarding the pathological mechanisms involving the DJ-1 and Pink1 mutations. Here we characterized DJ-1 and Pink1 knockout rats both through expression profiling and using quantitative autoradiography to measure the densities of the dopamine D-1, D-2, D-3 receptors, vesicular monoamine transporter type-2 (VMAT2) and dopamine transporter (DAT) in the striatum of transgenic rats and wild type controls. Expression profiling with a commercially available array of 84 genes known to be involved in PD indicated that only the target gene was significantly downregulated in each transgenic rat model. D-1 receptor, VMAT2, and DAT were measured using [H-3]SCH23390, [H-3]dihydrotetrabenazine, and [H-3]WIN35428, respectively. No significant changes were observed in the density of DAT in either model. Although the densities of VMAT2 and Di receptor were unchanged in Pinkl knockout, but both were increased in DJ-1 knockout rats. The densities of D2 and D3 receptors, determined by mathematical analysis of binding of radioligands [H-3]WC-10 and [H-3]raclopride, were significantly increased in both knockout models. These distinctive changes in the expression of dopamine presynaptic markers and receptors in the striatum may reflect different compensatory regulation of dopamine system in DJ-1 versus Pinkl knockout rat models of familial PD.

Moreover, since important interspecies differences are present in CB1 receptor expression, in vivo human data are of direct interest. We investigated an in vivo CB1 receptor expression in SCZ patients compared to healthy controls (CON), and in relation with psychopathological symptom severity using positron emission tomography (PET) and the selective high-affinity radioligand [F-18]MK-9470. A total of sixty-seven patients with SCZ, with (SCZ-T, n = 51) and without (SCZ-F, n = 16) antipsychotic treatment, and 12 age and gender-matched CON were investigated with [F-18]MK-9470 PET. Parametric modified standardized uptake value (mSUV) images, reflecting CB1 receptor binding, were compared and related to psychopathological symptoms. Compared to CON, there was a significant increase of CB1 receptor binding in SCZ patients in the nucleus accumbens, insula, cingulate cortex, inferior frontal cortex, parietal and mediotemporal lobe. Furthermore, in the SCZ-F group only, CB1 receptor binding was negatively correlated to negative symptoms and to depression scores, especially in the nucleus accumbens. Present findings strongly support that CB1 receptor binding is altered in the mesocorticolimbic circuitry of both SCZ-T and SCZ-F patients, especially in the nucleus accumbens. In SCZ-F patients, it is associated with negative symptoms and depression scores. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, hormone titers alone do not determine organismal response. To enhance our understanding of glucocorticoid actions we can examine 'downstream' factors in the organismal stress response, measuring glucocorticoid receptors across target tissues. Here, we characterized intracellular binding sites for CORT (corticosterone, the avian glucocorticoid) in house sparrow (Passer domesticus) brain, liver, skeletal muscle, spleen, fat, testes, ovary, kidney and skin. We used radioligand binding assays to identify total capacity, relative density and affinity for CURT of intracellular receptors in each tissue. Most evidence supported two binding sites similar to mammalian low-affinity glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and a high-affinity mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) for brain, liver, kidney and testes, and only a GR-like receptor for muscle, spleen, fat, ovary and skin. However, kidney data were somewhat more complicated, possibly hinting at a mineralocorticoid function for CURT and/or GR in birds. In all tissues, GR and MR affinities were close to published house sparrow values (K-d similar to 6 nM for GR, and similar to 0.2 nM for MR). Taken together, these data show that CORT receptor distribution appears to be as widespread in birds as it is in mammals, and suggest that independent regulation of peripheral receptors in different target tissues may play a role in CORT's diverse physiological effects.

AZD-3043 A Novel, Metabolically Labile Sedative-Hypnotic Agent with Rapid and Predictable Emergence from Hypnosis	ANESTHESIOLOGY			English	Article							ANESTHESIA; PROPOFOL; PHARMACOLOGY; BRAIN	Background: Propofol can be associated with delayed awakening after prolonged infusion. The aim of this study was to characterize the preclinical pharmacology of AZD-3043, a positive allosteric modulator of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor containing a metabolically labile ester moiety. The authors postulated that its metabolic pathway would result in a short-acting clinical profile. Methods: The effects of AZD-3043, propofol, and propanidid were studied on GABA(A) receptor-mediated chloride currents in embryonic rat cortical neurons. Radioligand binding studies were also performed. The in vitro stability of AZD-3043 in whole blood and liver microsomes was evaluated. The duration of the loss of righting reflex and effects on the electroencephalograph evoked by bolus or infusion intravenous administration were assessed in rats. A mixed-effects kinetic-dynamic model using minipigs permitted exploration of the clinical pharmacology of AZD-3043. Results: AZD-3043 potentiated GABA(A) receptor-mediated chloride currents and inhibited [S-35] tert-butylbicyclophos-phorothionate binding to GABA(A) receptors. AZD-3043 was rapidly hydrolyzed in liver microsomes from humans and animals. AZD-3043 produced hypnosis and electroencephalograph depression in rats. Compared with propofol, AZD-3043 was shorter acting in rats and pigs. Computer simulation using the porcine kinetic-dynamic model demonstrated that AZD-3043 has very short 50 and 80% decrement times independent of infusion duration. Conclusions: AZD-3043 is a positive allosteric modulator of the GABA(A) receptor in vitro and a sedative-hypnotic agent in vivo. The esterase dependent metabolic pathway results in rapid clearance and short duration of action even for long infusions. AZD-3043 may have clinical potential as a sedative-hypnotic agent with rapid and predictable recovery.

In vitro autoradiography with [18F]FPIT was used to determine the distribution of radioactivity in rat and monkey brains. In vivo experiments were performed using dissection and small-animal PET on rats, and PET on monkey. Metabolite analysis was performed on rat plasma and brain, and monkey plasma. Autoradiography of rat and monkey brains showed that [18F]FPIT binding is aligned with the reported distribution of mGluR1 with high specific binding in the cerebellum and thalamus. PET study on rat and monkey showed high brain uptake and distribution patterns consistent with those seen in the autoradiographic studies. The radioactivity in the brain was significantly decreased by pre-treatment with unlabeled FPIT, indicative of a specific signal for mGluR1 that was inhibited by mGluR1-selective ligand JNJ-16259865 in the brain. Metabolite analysis showed that the percentage of unchanged [18F]FPIT was 89% in the brain homogenate of rat at 90 min after injection. In the monkey plasma, the percentage of unchanged form was 50% at 90 min. [18F]FPIT produced in vitro and in vivo signals to visualize mGluR1 expression in rat and monkey brains, suggesting the usefulness of [18F]FPIT for imaging mGluR1 in human brain.

Human platelet activation depends on Ca(2+) release, leading to cell activation, granule secretion and aggregation. NAADP (nicotinic acid-adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is a Ca(2+)-releasing second messenger that acts on acidic Ca(2+) stores and is used by a number of mammalian systems. In human platelets, NAADP has been shown to release Ca(2+) in permeabilized human platelets and contribute to thrombin-mediated platelet activation. In the present study, we have further characterized NAADP-mediated Ca(2+) release in human platelets in response to both thrombin and the GPVI (glycoprotein VI)-specific agonist CRP (collagen-related peptide). Using a radioligand-binding assay, we reveal an NAADP-binding site in human platelets, indicative of a platelet NAADP receptor. We also found that NAADP releases loaded (45)Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and that total platelet Ca(2+) release is inhibited by the proton ionophore nigericin. Ned-19, a novel cell-permeant NAADP receptor antagonist, competes for the NAADP-binding site in platelets and can inhibit both thrombin- and CRP-induced Ca(2+) release in human platelets. Ned-19 has an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation, secretion and spreading. In addition, Ned-19 extends the clotting time in whole-blood samples. We conclude that NAADP plays an important role in human platelet function. Furthermore, the development of Ned-19 as an NAADP receptor antagonist provides a potential avenue for platelet-targeted therapy and the regulation of thrombosis.

Previous studies have shown alterations in the central cholinergic neurotransmission after TBI. We therefore determined alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) densities in newborn piglets and adult rats after experimental TBI. Thirteen newborn piglets (post-TBI survival time: 6 h) underwent fluid percussion (FP) injury (n = 7) or sham operation (n = 6). Furthermore, adult rats randomized into three groups of post-TBI survival times (2, 24, 72 h) received controlled cortical impact injury (CCI, n = 8) or sham operation (n = 8). Brains were frozen, sagittally cut and incubated with the alpha 7-specific radioligand [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin for autoradiography. In injured newborn piglets, decreased alpha 7 receptor densities were observed in the hippocampus (-38%), the hippocampus CA1 (-40%), thalamus (-30%) and colliculus superior (-30%). In adult rats, CCI decreased the receptor densities (between -16 and -47%) in almost any brain region within 2 and 24 h. In conclusion, widespread and significantly lowered alpha 7 nAChR densities were demonstrated in both TBI models. Our results suggest that a nearly similar TBI-induced decrease in the alpha 7 density in the brain of immature and adult animals is found, even with the differences in species, age and experimental procedures. The alterations make the alpha 7 nAChR a suitable target for drug development and neuroimaging after TBI.

Tumor cells were isolated from these tumor-bearing lymph nodes and 10(6) cells were implanted under the kidney capsule. Tumor growth after this implantation could be traced within six days. India ink was implanted to prove that there is a connection between the lymphatic vessels of the kidney capsule and the parathymic lymph nodes. The distribution of the radioligand (18)FDG in different organs also provided evidence that the parathymic lymph nodes are the primary sites of metastatic tumor growth. Tumor growth was followed after staining sections of biopsies of normal, tumorous kidneys and parathymic lymph nodes embedded in paraffin. The progression of tumor formation was seen as a frontline between the healthy and tumor bearing tissue. This demarcation line was sharp at the beginning of the invasion and at the peripheral regions of the tumor, while the central region infiltrated into the healthy kidney tissue. The initial invasion gradually turned to an infiltration resulting in the disruption of the renal tissue, especially at the periphery. Accumulation of lipids and flow of blood to the lymphatic vessels was due to the lack of angiogenesis, leading to an increased pressure of the interstitial fluid. Interstitial damage ultimately led to the appearance of blood and the growth of tumor cells in parathymic lymph nodes. The kidney capsule-parathymic lymph node complex is proposed as a suitable metastatic model for the isolated in vivo examination of tumor development and for the analysis of secondary tumors.

Radioligand binding and functional assays were performed using histamine H-4 receptors expressed in mammalian cell lines. Compounds were also evaluated ex vivo in monocyte-derived dendritic cells endogenously expressing H-4 receptors and in vivo in anaesthetized rats for gastric acid secretion activity. Both VUF 8430 and 4-methylhistamine were full agonists at human H-4 receptors with lower affinity at rat and mouse H-4 receptors. Both compounds induced chemotaxis of monocyte-derived dendritic cells. VUF 8430 also showed reasonable affinity and was a full agonist at the H-3 receptor. Agmatine is a metabolite of arginine, structurally related to VUF 8430, and was a H-4 receptor agonist with micromolar affinity. At histamine H-3 receptors, agmatine was a full agonist, whereas 4-methylhistamine was an agonist only at high concentrations. Both VUF 8430 and agmatine were inactive at H-1 and H-2 receptors, whereas 4-methylhistamine is as active as histamine at H-2 receptors. In vivo, VUF 8430 only caused a weak secretion of gastric acid mediated by H-2 receptors, whereas 4-methylhistamine, dimaprit, histamine and amthamine, at equimolar doses, induced 2.5- to 6-fold higher output than VUF 8430. Our results suggest complementary use of 4-methylhistamine and VUF 8430 as H-4 receptor agonists. Along with H-4 receptor antagonists, both agonists can serve as useful pharmacological tools in studies of histamine H-4 receptors.	[Lim, Herman D.; Smits, Rogier A.; de Esch, Iwan J.

Pharmacological properties of TD-6301, a novel bladder selective muscarinic receptor antagonist	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Overactive bladder; Muscarinic receptor; Volume induced bladder contraction	MOUSE URINARY-BLADDER; IN-VIVO; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; OVERACTIVE BLADDER; HUMAN IRIS; SUBTYPES; MICE; CONTRACTION; VITRO; RAT	Existing antimuscarinic drugs for overactive bladder have high affinity for M(3)/M(1) muscarinic receptors and consequently produce M(3)/M(1)-mediated adverse effects including dry mouth, constipation, mydriasis and somnolence. TD-6301 is a M(2/)4 muscarinic receptor-selective antagonist developed for the treatment of overactive bladder. The present studies characterize the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties of this molecule in comparison to other marketed antimuscarinics agents. In radioligand binding studies, TD-6301 was found to possess high affinity for human M(2) muscarinic receptor (Ki=0.36 nM) and was 31, 36, 2 and 128-fold selective for the human M(2) muscarinic receptor compared to the M(1), M(3), M(4) and M(5) muscarinic receptors, respectively. The in vivo bladder selectivity of TD-6301 in rats was determined to be 26, 28, >100, 16 and 0.4-fold, respectively, assessed by comparing its potency for inhibition of volume-induced bladder contractions to that for inhibition of oxotremorine-induced salivation, inhibition of small-intestinal transit, decreases in locomotor activity, increases in pupil diameter and increases in heart rate. TD-6301 was more potent in inhibiting volume-induced bladder contractions (ID(50)=0.075 mg/kg) compared to oxotremorine-induced salivation (ID(50)=1.0 mg/kg) resulting in a bladder/salivary gland selectivity ratio greater than that observed for tolterodine, oxybutynin, darifenacin and solifenacin. The preclinical properties of TD-6301 suggest that this molecule is likely to be efficacious in overactive bladder patients with a lower propensity to cause M(3) muscarinic receptor mediated adverse effects.

Greater Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Density in Smokers Than in Nonsmokers: A PET Study with 2-<SUP>18</SUP>F-FA-85380	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						molecular imaging; PET; radiotracer tissue kinetics; neuroimaging; nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; smoking	HUMAN BRAIN; UP-REGULATION; BINDING; BIODISTRIBUTION; QUANTIFICATION; TOLERANCE; INFUSION; TRACER	Assays of human postmortem brain tissue have revealed that smokers have greater densities of high-affinity nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in several brain regions than do nonsmokers or exsmokers. Quantitative PET imaging of nAChRs in humans has recently been reported using the alpha 4 beta 2* subtypespecific radioligand 2-F-18-FA-85380 (2FA). Methods: We used PET and 2FA to measure total volumes of distribution corrected for the free fraction of 2FA in plasma (V-T/f(p)) in 10 nonsmokers and 6 heavy smokers (>14 cigarettes/d; abstinent for >36 h). Dynamic PET scans were performed over 8 h, commencing immediately after a bolus injection of 2FA. Anatomic sampling was performed on PET images that were coregistered to MR images acquired from each volunteer. Data were analyzed by Logan plots and by 1- and 2-tissue-compartment models using unbound, unmetabolized arterial 2FA concentration as the input function. Results: All modeling methods yielded similar results. V-T/f(p) was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers in all brain regions tested, except the thalamus. We used measures of V-T/f(p) and estimates of nondisplaceable volume of distribution and found 25%-200% higher values in smokers than in nonsmokers for the volume of distribution for the specific binding compartment in the frontal cortex, midbrain, putamen, pons, cerebellum, and corpus callosum. These findings were consistent with voxel-based analysis using statistical parametric mapping. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PET with 2FA can be used to study the role of nicotine-induced upregulation of nAChRs in active smokers and during smoking cessation.

In vivo imaging of β-cell mass in rats using <SUP>18</SUP>F-FP-(+)-DTBZ:: A potential PET ligand for studying diabetes mellitus	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						diabetes; beta-cell mass; pancreas imaging; VMAT2	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; VESICULAR MONOAMINE TRANSPORTER-2; ISLET TRANSPLANTATION; ENDOCRINE PANCREAS; AGENTS; DIHYDROTETRABENAZINE; DERIVATIVES; EXPRESSION; VMAT2; RADIOLIGAND	Recent studies on gene expression of beta-cell mass (BCM) in the pancreas showed that vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) is highly expressed in the BCM (mainly in the islets of Langerhans). Imaging pancreatic BCM may provide an important tool for understanding the relationship between loss of insulin-secreting beta-cells and onset of diabetes mellitus. In this article, 9-fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (FP-(+)-DTBZ), which is a VMAT2 imaging agent, was evaluated as a PET agent for estimating BCM in vivo. Methods: Organ biodistribution after an intravenous injection of F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ (active isomer) and F-18-FP-(-)-DTBZ (inactive isomer) was evaluated in normal rats. The specificity of uptake of F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ was assessed by a pretreatment (3.8 mg of (+)-DTBZ per kilogram and 3.5 mg of FP-(+)-DTBZ per kilogram, intravenously, 5 min prior) or coadministration (2 mg of (+)-DTBZ per kilogram). PET studies were performed in normal rats. Results: The in vivo biodistribution of F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ in rats showed the highest uptake in the pancreas (5% dose/g at 30 min after injection), whereas F-18-FP-(-)-DTBZ showed a very low pancreas uptake. Rats pretreated with FP-(+)-DTBZ displayed a 78% blockade of pancreas uptake. PET studies in normal rats demonstrated an avid pancreas uptake of F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ. Conclusion: The preliminary data obtained with F-18-FP-(+)-DTBZ suggest that this fluorinated derivative of DTBZ shows good pancreas specificity and has the potential to be useful for quantitative measurement of VMAT2 binding sites reflecting BCM in the pancreas.

[<SUP>3</SUP>H]Benzophenone photolabeling identifies state-dependent changes in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor structure	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							AGONIST-BINDING; NONCOMPETITIVE ANTAGONIST; AMINO-ACIDS; CHANNEL; SITES; ACCESSIBILITY; REVEALS; ACTS	Interactions of benzophenone (BP) with the Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) were characterized by electrophysiological analyses, radioligand binding assays, and photolabeling of nAChR-rich membranes with [H-3]BP to identify the amino acids contributing to its binding sites. BP acted as a low potency noncompetitive antagonist, reversibly inhibiting the ACh responses of nAChRs expressed in Xenopus oocytes (IC50 = 600,mu M) and the binding of the noncompetitive antagonist [3H]-tetracaine to nAChR-rich membranes (IC50 = 150 mu M). UV irradiation at 365 nm resulted in covalent incorporation of [H-3]BP into the nAChR subunits (delta > alpha similar to beta > gamma), with photoincorporation limited to the nAChR transmembrane domain. Comparison of nAChR photolabeling in the closed state (absence of agonist) and desensitized state (equilibrated with agonist) revealed selective desensitized state labeling in the 6 subunit of delta Phe-232 in delta M1 and delta Pro-286/delta Ile-288 near the beginning of delta M3 that are within a pocket at the interface between the transmembrane and extracellular domains. There was labeling in the closed state within the ion channel at position M2-13 (alpha Val-255, beta Val-261, and delta Val-269) that was reduced by 90% upon desensitization and labeling in the transmembrane M3 helices of the beta and gamma subunits (beta Met-285, beta Met-288, and gamma Met-291) that was reduced by 50-80% in the desensitized state. Labeling at the lipid interface (alpha Met-415 in alpha M4) was unaffected by agonist. These results provide a further definition of the regions in the nAChR transmembrane domain that differ in structure between the closed and desensitized states.

Chronic nicotine differentially regulates α6-and β3-containing nicotinic cholinergic receptors in rat brain	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ALPHA-CONOTOXIN-MII; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; BINDING-SITES; UP-REGULATION; DOPAMINE RELEASE; LONG-TERM; STRIATAL SYNAPTOSOMES; SUBUNIT COMPOSITION; MOUSE-BRAIN; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS	We investigated the effects of chronic nicotine on alpha 6- and beta 3-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors ( nAChRs) in two rat brain regions using three methodological approaches: radioligand binding, immunoprecipitation, and nicotine- stimulated synaptosomal release of dopamine. Nicotine was administered by osmotic minipumps for 2 weeks. Quantitative autoradiography with [I-125]alpha-conotoxin MII to selectively label alpha 6* nAChRs showed a 28% decrease in binding in the striatum but no change in the superior colliculus. Immunoprecipitation of nAChRs labeled by [H-3] epibatidine in these two regions showed that chronic nicotine increased alpha 4- and beta 2- containing nAChRs by 39 to 67%. In contrast, chronic nicotine caused a 39% decrease in alpha 6- containing nAChRs in striatum but no change in superior colliculus. No changes in beta 3-containing nAChRs were seen in either region after chronic nicotine. The decreased expression of alpha 6- containing nAChRs persisted for at least 3 days, recovering to baseline by 7 days after removal of the pumps. There was a small but significant decrease in total nicotine- stimulated dopamine release in striatal synaptosomes after nicotine exposure. However, the component of dopamine release that was resistant to alpha 6-conotoxin MII blockade was unaffected, whereas dopamine release that was sensitive to blockade by alpha-conotoxin MII was decreased by 56%. These findings indicate that the alpha 6* nAChR is regulated differently from other nAChR subtypes, and they suggest that the inclusion of a beta 3 subunit with alpha 6 may serve to inhibit nicotineinduced down- regulation of these receptors.

Structure-affinity relationships of adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> receptor ligands	MEDICINAL RESEARCH REVIEWS			English	Article						adenosine A(2B) receptor; agonists; antagonists; structure-affinity relationships	SELECTIVE ANTAGONIST RADIOLIGAND; A(3) RECEPTOR; XANTHINE DERIVATIVES; HIGHLY POTENT; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; HUMAN-FIBROBLASTS; MAST-CELLS; SUBTYPES; AGONISTS; PHARMACOLOGY	Many selective and high affinity agonists and antagonists have been developed for the adenosine A,, A(2A), and A(3) receptors. Very recently such compounds have been identified for the adenosine A(2B) receptors. This review presents an overview of the structure-affinity relationships of antagonists and agonists for this receptor subtype as published in the scientific and patent literature. To date the most selective > 370-fold, high affinity adenosine A2B receptor antagonist is the xanthine analog, compound 16 (8-(1-(3-phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)methyl)1H-pyrazol-4-yl)-1,3-dipropyl-1H-purine-2,6(3H,7H)-dionel). The pyrrolopyrimidine analog OSIP339391 (73) is slightly less selective, 70-fold, but has a higher affinity 0.41 nM compared to I nM for compound 16. Other promising classes of compounds with selectivities ranging from 10- to 160-fold and affinities ranging from 3 to 112 nM include triazolo, aminothiazole, quinazoline, and pyrimidin-2-amine analogs. Progress has also been achieved concerning the development of selective high affinity agonists for the adenosine A2B receptor. For years the most potent, albeit non-selective adenosine A2B receptor agonist was (S)PHPNECA (88). Last year, a new class of non-ribose ligands was reported. Several compounds displayed selectivity with respect to adenosine A(2A) and A(3) receptors. In addition, full and partial agonists for the adenosine A(2B) receptor were identified with EC50 values of 10 nM (LUF5835, 103) and 9 nM (LUF5845, 105), respectively.

J	Enan, EE				Enan, EE			Molecular response of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> tyramine receptor cascade to plant essential oils	INSECT BIOCHEMISTRY AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						tyramine receptor; cAMP; [Ca(2+)]i; Drosophila melanogaster; G-protein coupled receptor; plant essential oils	MORI ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; OCTOPAMINE RECEPTOR; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; 2ND-MESSENGER SYSTEMS; PERIPLANETA-AMERICANA; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; INSECTICIDAL ACTIVITY; NEGATIVE MODULATION; APIS-MELLIFERA; LOCUST	This paper reports the role of the tyramine (TA) receptor cascade in the insecticidal activity of plant essential oils. A TA receptor cDNA encoding a putative seven transmembrane domain G-protein coupled receptor was amplified from Drosophila melanogaster head cDNA phage library. The encoded protein contains 601 amino acids and has a sequence similar to other biogenic amine receptors. This protein was expressed in Drosophila S2 cells for radioligand binding studies with the ligand 3 H-TA. Competitive binding studies comparing biogenic amines that could potentially function as endogenous ligands have demonstrated that this receptor had the highest affinity for TA (K(i) = 1.27 mu M) followed by DL-octopamine, dopamine, serotonin and histamine. TA decreased the forskolin-increased cAMP levels (IC(50) = 5.802 mu M) and increased [Ca(2+)](i) through the receptor expressed in S2 cells. The toxicity rank order of the tested plant essential oils against wild type D. melanogaster fly demonstrated a pattern similar to their effect on receptor binding activity and changes in cAMP level and [Ca(2+)](i). The toxicity of two of these chemicals was eliminated when tested against the TA receptor mutant (TyrR(neo30)) Drosophila strain. Therefore, the data indicates a correlation between cellular changes and insecticidal activity of tested plant essential oils, and suggests that the toxicity of at least two of these chemicals is mediated through the TA receptor.

Vesicles were loaded with Ca-45(2+) and membrane potentials were generated by establishing potassium gradients across the vesicle using the ionophore valinomycin. Arachidonoylethanolamide and docosaenoylethanolamide but not palmitoylethanolamide and stearoylethanolamide (all 10 muM) caused a significant inhibition of depolarization-induced Ca-45(2+) fluxes and specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine to transverse tubule membranes. On the other hand. Saturated fatty acids including palmitic, stearic, arachidic, and docosanoic acids (all 10 muM) were ineffective in functional and radioligand binding experiments. Additional experiments using endocannabinoid metabolites suggested that whereas ethanolamine and arachidic acids were ineffective, arachidonoylethanolamide inhibited Ca2+ effluxes and specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine. Further studies indicated that only those fatty acids containing ethanolamine as a head group and having a chain length of more than 18 carbons were effective in inhibiting depolarization-induced Ca2+ effluxes and specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine. In conclusion, results indicate that depending on the chain length and the head group of fatty acid, N-acylethanolamines have differential effects on the function of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels and on the specific binding of [H-3]Isradipine in skeletal Muscle membranes.

TRHRs and ubiquitin coprecipitated with antibodies to either receptor or ubiquitin in Chinese hamster ovary or pituitary GHFT cells. Inhibition of the proteasome with MG-132 resulted in an accumulation of total TRHRs and the appearance of a small amount of cytosolic receptor. MG-132 caused an increase in newly synthesized receptors, detected by microscopy using a TRHR coupled to Timer, a DsRed that undergoes a spontaneous time-dependent color change. Misfolded TRHRs were particularly heavily ubiquitinated. These results show that the proteasome participates in TRHR quality control early after receptor synthesis. Under normal circumstances, most ubiquitinated TRHRs were absorbed to wheat germ agglutinin, indicating that they had undergone complex glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus. When cells were treated with tunicamycin to block glycosylation, a ladder of ubiquitinated species was detectable. Cell surface receptors, which were labeled selectively with either radioligand or antibody, showed no detectable ubiquitin modification. To determine if ubiqutination plays a role in TRH-induced receptor endocytosis, the receptor was expressed in Ts20 cells, which have a temperature-sensitive ubiquitin pathway. TRH induced a significant calcium response and rapid and extensive receptor internalization at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures, indicating that ligand-dependent ubiquitination of the receptor, or any other protein, is not necessary for TRHR signaling or internalization. These results show that ubiquitin modification targets misfolded receptors for degradation and suggest a possible role for ubiquitination in receptor trafficking.

The optimum condition for the production of [C-11]CH3I was determined to be 630degreesC for oven-1 (reaction column), 50degreesC for oven-2 (iodine column) and 50 ml/rain for the He gas flow rate, and gave the maximum conversion ratio of [C-11]CH3I. 44%. [C-11]RoI5-4513, known as an inverse agonist of the benzodiazepine receptor, was produced under optimized conditions. An i.v. injectable [C-11]Ro15-4513 solution of 1500 +/- 490 MBq (n = 6) with specific activity 4700 +/- 2500 GBq/mumol and a radiochemical Purity of 98.2 +/- 2% was obtained automatically within 25 minutes (from EOB) by irradiating nitrogen gas containing 5% H-2 with 18 Mev protons (14.2 MeV on target) at 20 muA for 20 minutes. The highest specific activity of 9700 GBq/mumol (at EOS) could be achieved, although the radiochemical purity was 92.4%. By the use of the ultra-hi h specific activity [C-11]Ro15-4513, the super high 9 affinity binding, sites in the rat brain hippocampus could be clearly visualized even at the extremely low concentration of 0.66pM Ro15-4513 by invitro autoradiography.

Radioligand binding experiments showed that chimeric AngII receptors possessing the AT(2) third extracellular loop and seventh transmembrane-spanning domain bound CGP 42112A with high affinity approaching that of the wild-type AT(2) receptor. The presence of the AT(2) third extracellular loop appeared sufficient for high-affinity CGP 42112A binding, which was further enhanced by the additional presence of the AT(2) seventh transmembrane-spanning domain. Experiments with PD 123319, losartan, and [Sar(1),Ile(8)]-AngII showed that increases in binding affinity associated with these domains were specific for CGP 42112A. Use of phosphoinositide hydrolysis as a functional index to measure activation of these chimeric AngII receptors further demonstrated that the AT(2) seventh transmembrane-spanning domain was especially critical for CGP 42112A to act as an agonist. The absence of the AT2 seventh transmembrane-spanning domain prohibited CGP 42112A-induced activation of these receptors, even in the presence of high concentrations of CGP 42112A sufficient to saturate the binding sites. This study is the first to identify binding determinants of the AT, receptor that are selective for CGP 42112A, and indicates that these determinants are at least partially distinct from those for the AT(2)-selective antagonist PD 123319. These differences may be a factor in the pharmacodynamic difference between these two ligands.

To gain more insight into the role of this receptor subtype in the modulation of inhibitory neurotransmission, we generated mice lacking either the alpha1 or beta2 subunit. In agreement with the reported abundance of this subtype,.50% of total GABA(A) receptors are lost in both alpha1/-/- and 2 mice. Surprisingly, homozygotes of both mouse lines are viable, fertile, and show no spontaneous seizures. Initially half of the alpha1-2/- 2 mice died prenatally or perinatally, but they exhibited a lower mortality rate in subsequent generations, suggesting some phenotypic drift and adaptive changes. Both adult alpha1-/- and beta2-/- mice demonstrate normal performances on the rotarod, but beta2-/- mice displayed increased locomotor activity. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum primarily express alpha1 beta2 gamma2 receptors, and in electrophysiological recordings from alpha1-/- mice GABA currents in these neurons are dramatically reduced, and residual currents have a benzodiazepine pharmacology characteristic of alpha2- or alpha3- containing receptors. In contrast, the cerebellar Purkinje neurons from beta2-/- mice have only a relatively small reduction of GABA currents. In beta2-/- mice expression levels of all six a subunits are reduced by similar to 50%, suggesting that the beta2 subunit can coassemble with a subunits other than just alpha1. Our data confirm that alpha1 beta2 gamma2 is the major GABA(A) receptor subtype in the murine brain and demonstrate that, surprisingly, the loss of this receptor subtype is not lethal.

Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-SK3 antibody and radioligand binding using [I-125]-apamin demonstrated the presence of hSK3 channel in the recombinant cell line. This cell line was utilised in a fluorescence assay using the membrane potential-sensitive dye DiBAC(4)(3) to functionally analyse and pharmacologically characterise this potassium channel. The analysis of known blockers of calcium-activated potassium channels revealed the highest potency for apamin (IC50=13.2 nM). This result was confirmed by direct recordings of SK3 currents using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine. imipramine and nortriptyline as well as phenothiazines such as fluphenazine, promethazine, chlorpromazine and trifluoperazine blocked the hSK3 channel with micromolar potencies. These compounds also displaced [I-125]-apamin binding to the hSK3 channel thus suggesting direct and competitive channel blocking activity. Since these compounds: share a common three-ring molecular core structure, this feature seems to be important for channel blocking activity. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and calyculin A were able to abolish channel activation with nanomolar potencies, but did not displace [I-125]-apamin binding. Thus, phosphorylation of hSK3 or an accessory channel subunit seems to be involved in its modulation. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although serum estrogen levels influence many aspects of LHRH neuronal activity in the female, earlier studies were unable to detect estrogen receptors (ERs) within LHRH neurons, thus shaping a consensus view that the effects of estradiol an the LHRH neuronal system are mediated by interneurons and/or the glial matrix. The present studies used dual-label in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) and combined LHRH-immunocytochemistry/I-125-estrogen binding to readdress the estrogen-receptivity of LHRH neurons in the female rat. in ISHH experiments we found that the majority of LHRH neurons exhibited hybridization signal for the "beta" form of ER (ER-beta). The degree of colocalization was similar in topographically distinct populations of LHRH neurons and was not significantly altered by estradiol (67.2+/-1.8% in ovariectomized and 73.8+/-4.2% in ovariectomized and estradiol-treated rats). in contrast, the mRNA encoding the classical ER-alpha could not be detected within LHRH neurons. In addition in vivo binding studies using I-125-estrogen revealed a subset of LHRH-immunoreactive neurons (8.8%) which accumulated the radioligand thus providing evidence for the translation of ER protein(s) within these cells. The findings that most LHRH neurons in the female rat express ER-beta mRNA and at least some are capable of binding I-125-estrogen challenge the current opinion that estrogen does not exert direct effects upon the LHRH neuronal system.

The equilibrium dissociation constant of the radioligand [H-3]GR 125743 was similar for both chimera compared to the wild-type (wt) h 5-HT1B receptor upon transient expression in COS-7 cells. Ketanserin binding affinity was 21-fold increased from pK(i): 5.79 (wt h 5-HT1B receptor) to pK(i): 7.11 at the 5-HT1B/2A chimeric receptor, this latter value being close to that of the wt h 5-HT1D receptor (pK(i): 7.62). This enhanced ketanserin binding affinity was lost when the last 44 C-terminal amino acids of the 5-HT,, receptor were deleted in the chimera 5-HT1B/2A Delta 44 (pK(i): 5.80). The binding affinities of the 5-HT antagonists ritanserin, GR 125743, and SB-224289 were not modified at either chimeric 5-HT receptor. The agonists F 11356, 5-HT, zolmitriptan, and sumatriptan yielded slightly increased (2- to 6-fold) binding affinities at both chimera as compared to the wt h 5-HT1B receptor. The present data suggest a role for the C-terminal intracellular receptor domain in modifying ketanserin/5-HT1B receptor interactions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study sought to prepare fluoro analogs of CPPC with higher affinity to provide the potential for labeling with longer-lived fluorine-18 (t1/2 = 109.8 min) and for delivery of higher CSF1R-specific PET signal in vivo. Seven fluorine-containing analogs of CPPC were prepared and four were found to have high inhibitory potency (IC50 in low to sub-nM range) and selectivity at CSF1R comparable with CPPC itself. One of these, a 4-fluoromethyl analog (Psa374), was investigated more deeply by labeling with carbon-11 (t1/2 = 20.4 min) for PET studies in mouse and monkey. [11C]Psa374 showed high peak uptake in monkey brain but not in mouse brain. Pharmacological challenges revealed no CSF1R-specific binding in either species at baseline. [11C]CPPC also failed to show specific binding at baseline. Moreover, both [11C]Psa374 and [11C]CPPC showed brain efflux transporter substrate behavior in both species in vivo, although Psa374 did not show liability toward human efflux transporters in vitro. Further development of [11C]Psa374 in non-human primate models of neuroinflammation with demonstration of CSF1Rspecific binding would be required to warrant the fluorine-18 labeling of Psa374 with a view to possible application in human subjects.

SJT4a is a synthetic beta-carboline antagonist for 5-HT2AR developed by SJT molecular research to treat NASH. We performed a combined in silico/in vivo study on this potential drug to elucidate its activity and possible mechanism of action.The in silico protocol compares SJT4a with four known 5-HT2AR ligands with different activities (LSD, methiothepin, zotepine, risperidone). We performed molecular docking calculations, evaluation of binding en-ergy by AI-based methods and Molecular Dynamics simulations of the five ligand-target complexes. Moreover, we used a pseudo-semantic analysis to evaluate the potential mechanism of action of SJT4a. In silico predictions and pseudo-semantic analysis suggested antagonistic activity for SJT4a. The in silico prediction was confirmed by [3H]-5HT radioligand binding together with SJT4a competition analysis in CHO-K1 cell cultures expressing 5-HT2AR.SJT4a was then tested in vivo. We investigated the effect of 8 weeks of treatment with SJT4A on metabolic parameters, liver pathology, NAFLD activity score, and fibrosis stage in male DIO-NASH C57BL/6 J mice diet -induced obesity fed with an obesogenic diet compared with DIO-NASH and LEAN-CHOW vehicles. In our tests, SJT4a showed intense activity in diminishing the most relevant hallmarks of NASH in the DIO-NASH mice model. We proposed a possible mode of action for SJT4a based on its 5-HT2AR antagonist activity.

Despite introduction of novel therapies, the mortality rate remains high. An attractive alternative for extension of the life of mCRPC patients is PSMA-based targeted radioimmunotherapy. In this paper, we extended our in vitro study of Ra-223-labeled and PSMA-targeted NaA nanozeolites [(223)RaA-silane-PEG-D2B] by undertaking comprehensive preclinical in vitro and in vivo research. The toxicity of the new compound was evaluated in LNCaP C4-2, DU-145, RWPE-1 and HPrEC prostate cells and in BALB/c mice. The tissue distribution of Ba-133- and Ra-223-labeled conjugates was studied at different time points after injection in BALB/c and LNCaP C4-2 tumor-bearing BALB/c Nude mice. No obvious symptoms of antibody-free and antibody-functionalized nanocarriers cytotoxicity and immunotoxicity was found, while exposure to Ra-223-labeled conjugates resulted in bone marrow fibrosis, decreased the number of WBC and platelets and elevated serum concentrations of ALT and AST enzymes. Biodistribution studies revealed high accumulation of Ra-223-labeled conjugates in the liver, lungs, spleen and bone tissue. Nontargeted and PSMA-targeted radioconjugates exhibited a similar, marginal uptake in tumour lesions. In conclusion, despite the fact that NaA nanozeolites are safe carriers, the intravenous administration of NaA nanozeolite-based radioconjugates is dubious due to its high accumulation in the lungs, liver, spleen and bones.

However, it is suggested there is a subgroup of participants with schizophrenia who have profound loss of cortical CHRM1 (MRDS). This raises the possibility that some participants with schizophrenia may not respond optimally to CHRM1 allosteric modulation. Here we describe a novel methodology to measure positive allosteric modulation of CHRM1 in human CNS and the measurement of that response in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum from participants with MRDS, non-MRDS and controls. Methods: The cortex (Brodmann's area 6), hippocampus, and striatum from 40 participants with schizophrenia (20 MRDS and 20 non-MRDS) and 20 controls were used to measure benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid-mediated shift in acetylcholine displacement of [H-3]N-methylscopolamine using a novel in situ radioligand binding with autoradiography methodology. Results: Compared with controls, participants with schizophrenia had lower levels of specific [H-3]N-methylscopolamine binding in all CNS regions, whilst benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid-modulated binding was less in the striatum, Brodmann's area 6, dentate gyrus, and subiculum. When divided by subgroup, only in MRDS was there lower specific [H-3]N-methylscopolamine binding and less benzyl quinolone carboxylic acid-modulated binding in all cortical and subcortical regions studied. Conclusions: In a subgroup of participants with schizophrenia, there is a widespread decreased responsiveness to a positive allosteric modulator at the CHRM1. This finding may have ramifications it positive allosteric modulators of the CHRM1 are used in clinical trials to treat schizophrenia as some participants may not have an optimal response.

Ni(I)-X Complexes Bearing a Bulky α-Diimine Ligand: Synthesis, Structure, and Superior Catalytic Performance in the Hydrogen Isotope Exchange in Pharmaceuticals	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							H BOND ACTIVATION; OXIDATIVE ADDITION; C-F; RADIOLABELED COMPOUNDS; NICKEL PRECATALYSTS; LABELED COMPOUNDS; PINCER COMPLEXES; DRUG DISCOVERY; N-HETEROCYCLES; ARYL HALIDES	The synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a family of Ni X (X = Cl, Br, I, H) complexes supported by the bulky alpha-diimine chelate N,N'-bis(1R,2R,3R,5S)-(-)-iso-pinocampheyl-2,3-butanediimine ((ipc)ADI) are described. Diimine-supported, three-coordinate nickel(I)-X complexes have been proposed as key intermediates in a host of catalytic transformations such as C-C and C-heteroatom cross coupling and C-H functionalization but have until now remained synthetically elusive. A combination of structural, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies were used to establish the electronic structure of each monomeric [((ipc)ADI)NiX] (X = Cl, Br, I) complex as a nickel(I) derivative supported by a redox-neutral alpha-diimine chelate. The dimeric nickel hydride, [((ipc)ADI)Ni(mu(2)-H)](2), was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction; however, magnetic measurements and 'H NMR spectroscopy support monomer formation at ambient temperature in THE solution. This nickel hydride was used as a precatalyst for the hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of C-H bonds in arenes and pharmaceuticals. By virtue of the multisite reactivity and high efficiency, the new nickel precatalyst provided unprecedented high specific activities (50-99 C-i/mmol) in radiolabeling, meeting the threshold required for radioligand binding assays. Use of air-stable and readily synthesized nickel precursor, [((ipc)ADI)NiBr2], broad functional group tolerance, and compatibility with polar protic solvents are additional assets of the nickel-catalyzed HIE method.

The use of this tracer has identified receptor binding changes in clinical populations, and has been informative in drug occupancy studies. However, previous studies have found significant increases in [C-11]ABP688 binding in the later scan of same-day comparisons, and estimates of test-retest reliability under consistent scanning conditions are not available. The objective of this study was to assess the variability of [C-11]ABP688 binding in healthy people in scans performed at the same time of day. Two [C-11]ABP688 scans were acquired in eight healthy volunteers (6 women, 2 men) using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT). Scans were acquired 3 weeks apart with start times between 10:00am and 1:30pm. Mean mGluR5 binding potential (BPND) values were calculated across cortical, striatal and limbic brain regions. Participants reported on subjective mood state after each scan and blood samples were drawn for cortisol analysis. No significant change in BPND between scans was observed. Variability in BPND values of 11-21% was observed across regions, with the greatest change in the hippocampus and amygdala. Reliability was low to moderate. BPND was not statistically related to scan start time, subjective anxiety, serum cortisol levels, or menstrual phase in women. Overall, [C-11]ABP688 BPND estimates show moderate variability in healthy people. Reliability is fair in cortical and striatal regions, and lower in limbic regions. Future research using this ligand should account for this in study design and analysis.	[Smart, Kelly; Cox, Sylvia M.

The pathophysiology behind the rapid development of hyperkalemia is not well understood. We hypothesized that the hyperkalemia should be associated with metabolic acidosis. Results: Twenty- two patients underwent ERT. Prior to the first cycle, excretory kidney function was assessed by mercapto-acetyltriglycine ( MAG-3) renal scintigraphy, serum biochemistry, and calculated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR). All patients received co-infusion of the cationic amino acids L-arginine and L-lysine for nephroprotection. Clinical symptoms, electrolytes, and acid-base status were evaluated at baseline and after 4 h. No patient developed any clinically relevant side effects. At baseline, acid base status and electrolytes were normal in all patients. Excretory kidney function was normal or only mildly impaired in all except two patients with stage 3 renal insufficiency. All patients developed hyperkalemia. Base excess and HCO3 were significantly lower after 4 h. In parallel, mean pH dropped from 7.36 to 7.29. There was a weak association between calculated ( r = -0.21) as well as MAG-3-derived GFR ( r = -0.32) and the rise in potassium after 4 h. Conclusion: Amino acid co-infusion during ERT leads to severe metabolic acidosis which induces hyperkalemia by potassium hydrogen exchange. This novel finding implies that commercially available bicarbonate solutions might be an easy therapeutic option to correct metabolic acidosis rapidly.

A monoclonal antibody raised against a thermo-stabilised β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor interacts with extracellular loop 2 and acts as a negative allosteric modulator of a sub-set of β<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors expressed in stable cell lines	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						GPCR; Allosterism; Monoclonal antibody; Extracellular loop 2	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; ADENOSINE A(1) RECEPTOR; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; LIGAND RECOGNITION; AGONIST; BINDING; DISCOVERY; AFFINITY; REVEAL; GPCRS	Recent interest has focused on antibodies that can discriminate between different receptor conformations. Here we have characterised the effect of a monoclonal antibody (mAb3), raised against a purified thermo-stabilised turkey beta(1)-adrenoceptor (beta(1)AR-m23 StaR), on beta(1)-ARs expressed in CHO-K1 or HEK 293 cells. Immunohistochemical and radioligand-binding studies demonstrated that mAb3 was able to bind to ECL2 of the t beta(1)-AR, but not its human homologue. Specific binding of mAb3 to t beta(1)-AR was inhibited by a peptide based on the turkey, but not the human, ECL2 sequence. Studies with [H-3]-CGP 12177 demonstrated that mAb3 prevented the binding of orthosteric ligands to a subset (circa 40%) of turkey beta(1)-receptors expressed in both CHO K1 and HEK 293 cells. MAb3 significantly reduced the maximum specific binding capacity of [H-3]-CGP-12177 without influencing its binding affinity. Substitution of ECL2 of t beta(1)-AR with its human equivalent, or mutation of residues D186S, P187D, Q188E prevented the inhibition of [H-3]-CGP 12177 binding by mAb3. MAb3 also elicited a negative allosteric effect on agonist-stimulated CAMP responses. The identity of the subset of turkey beta(1)-adrenoceptors influenced by mAb3 remains to be established but mAb3 should become an important tool to investigate the nature of beta(1)-AR conformational states and oligomeric complexes.

The bias extent depends on the amount of radioactivity in the blood vessels. In this study, we seek to revisit the well-established Logan plot and derive alternative formulations that provide estimation of distribution volume ratios (DVRs) that are corrected for the signal originating from the vasculature. Results: New expressions for the Logan plot based on arterial input function and reference tissue were derived, which included explicit terms for whole blood radioactivity. The new methods were evaluated using PET data acquired using [C-11] raclopride and [(\)] MNI-659. The two-tissue compartment model (2TCM), with which signal originating from blood can be explicitly modeled, was used as a gold standard. DVR values obtained for [C-11] raclopride using the either blood-based or reference tissue-based Logan plot were systematically underestimated compared to 2TCM, and for [F-18] MNI-659, a proportionality bias was observed, i.e., the bias varied across regions. The biases disappeared when optimal blood-signal correction was used for respective tracer, although for the case of [F-18] MNI-659 a small but systematic overestimation of DVR was still observed. Conclusions: The new method appears to remove the bias introduced due to absence of correction for blood volume in regular graphical analysis and can be considered in clinical studies. Further studies are however required to derive a generic mapping between plasma and whole-blood radioactivity levels.

Driven by the outstanding efforts of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a truly invaluable resource, the initial use of MRI in AD imaging has been to assess changes in brain anatomy, specifically assessing brain shrinkage and regional changes in white matter tractography using diffusion tensor imaging. However, advances in MRI have led to multiple efforts toward imaging amyloid beta plaques first without and then with the use of MRI contrast agents. These technological advancements have met with limited success and are not yet appropriate for the clinic. Recent developments in molecular imaging inclusive of high-power liposomal-based MRI contrast agents as well as fluorine 19 (F-19) MRI and manganese enhanced MRI have begun to propel promising advances toward not only plaque imaging but also using MRI to detect perturbations in subcellular processes occurring within the neuron. This review concludes with a discussion about the necessity for the development of novel preclinical models of AD that better recapitulate human AD for the imaging to truly be meaningful and for substantive progress to be made toward understanding and effectively treating AD. Furthermore, the continued support of outstanding programs such as ADNI as well as the development of novel molecular imaging agents and MRI fast scanning sequences will also be requisite to effectively translate preclinical findings to the clinic.

The norepinephrine transporter (NET) regulates the synaptic availability of norepinephrine. However, NET availability has not been previously characterized in vivo in obese people using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging. Here we report findings evaluating NET availability in individuals with obesity and matched lean (i.e., normal weight) comparison subjects. Methods: Seventeen obese but otherwise healthy individuals with a mean +/- SD body mass index (BMI) of 34.7 +/- 2.6 and 17 lean individuals with a mean SD BMI of 23.1 +/- 1.4 were studied using a high-resolution research tomograph (HRRT) and (S,S)-[C-11]O-methylreboxetine ([C-11]-MRB), a radioligand selective for the NET. The regional brain NET binding potential (BPND) was estimated by the multilinear reference tissue model 2 (MRTM2) with the occipital cortex as a reference region. BPND for regions of interest were obtained with the Automated Anatomic Labeling (AAL) template registered to individual's structural MR scans. Results: Obese individuals had lower NET BPND values in the thalamus (p< 0.038, 27% reduction) including within the pulvinar (p < 0.083, 30% reduction), but not in the hypothalamus, locus coeruleus or the raphe nuclei, compared to lean individuals. When age was included as a covariate, the difference in NET BPND values remained significant in the thalamus (p <0.025) and pulvinar (p <0.042). Conclusions: These results indicate that NET availability is decreased in the thalamus, including the pulvinar, in obese individuals. These findings further support data indicating noradrenergic dysfunction in obesity and suggest impaired NE clearance in obesity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

On the basis of the pharmacological core of this ligands series, a new magnetic resonance imaging probe, coded DPA-C-6-(Gd)DOTAMA was designed and successfully synthesized in six steps and 13% overall yield from DPA-713. The Gd-DOTA monoamide cage (DOTA = 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) represents the magnetic resonance imaging reporter, which is spaced from the phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a] pyrimidineacetamide moiety (DPA-713 motif) by a six carbon-atom chain. DPA-C-6-(Gd)DOTAMA relaxometric characterization showed the typical behavior of a small-sized molecule (relaxivity value: 6.02mM(-1) s(-1) at 20 MHz). The good hydrophilicity of the metal chelate makes DPA-C-6-( Gd)DOTAMA soluble in water, affecting thus its biodistribution with respect to the parent lipophilic DPA-713 molecule. For this reason, it was deemed of interest to load the probe to a large carrier in order to increase its residence lifetime in blood. Whereas DPA-C-6-(Gd)DOTAMA binds to serum albumin with a low affinity constant, it can be entrapped into liposomes (both in the membrane and in the inner aqueous cavity). The stability of the supramolecular adduct formed by the Gd-complex and liposomes was assessed by a competition test with albumin. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Reassessment of the pharmacology of Sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P3 receptor ligands using the DiscoveRx PathHunter™ and Ca2+release functional assays	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Sphingosine-1-phosphate; DiscoveRx PathHunter (TM); drug discovery; agonist efficacy; ss-arrestin coupling; receptor conformation	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; SPHINGOSINE 1-PHOSPHATE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE DiscoverRx's PathHunter (TM) assay measures GPCR agonist potency, via the recruitment of beta-arrestin, independent of the subtype of G alpha protein activated. This assay is frequently used in drug discovery although little is known about the agonist pharmacology generated. Here we have compared agonist potency, efficacy and affinity values obtained in PathHunter (TM) assays with those from more established radioligand binding and functional techniques. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using cells expressing the human sphingosine-1-phosphate S1P3 receptor at four different densities, we compared pharmacological affinity and efficacy values of four structurally distinct ligands FTY720-P, VPC24191, CYM5442 and the endogenous agonist S1P obtained from competition binding, functional Ca2+ release and PathHunter (TM) assays. KEY RESULTS The pKi values for S1P were significantly different (9.34 +/- 0.10 and 8.92 +/- 0.15) in clones expressing different receptor levels using the binding assay. In the PathHunter (TM) and Ca2+ assays, S1P and CYM5442 were full agonists, FTY720-P was a partial agonist, while the efficacy of VPC24191 could not be detected in PathHunter (TM) assays. VPC23019, previously described as a S1P1/3 receptor antagonist, behaved as an S1P3 receptor partial agonist in the Ca2+ release assay. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Comparison of data from the PathHunter (TM) assay with binding and functional Ca2+ assays suggest that PathHunter (TM) assays measured a different agonist-bound receptor conformation. While this assay has great utility in drug discovery, care must be taken as high-efficacy, low-affinity agonist compounds would not be detected. Therefore highly amplified, more traditional assays are necessary to identify agonists with low efficacy.	[Riddy, D. M.; Stamp, C.; Sykes, D. A.; Charlton, S. J.; Dowling, M.

Changes in dopamine D2-receptor binding are associated to symptom reduction after psychotherapy in social anxiety disorder	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						CBT; dopamine; D2-receptor; PET; social anxiety disorder	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; RECEPTOR AVAILABILITY; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; WORKING-MEMORY; D-2 RECEPTORS; HUMAN CORTEX; PET; RELEASE; PHOBIA; AFFINITY	The dopamine system has been suggested to play a role in social anxiety disorder (SAD), partly based on molecular imaging studies showing reduced levels of striatal dopaminergic markers in patients compared with control subjects. However, the dopamine system has not been examined in frontal and limbic brain regions proposed to be central in the pathophysiology of SAD. In the present study, we hypothesized that extrastriatal dopamine D2-receptor (D2-R) levels measured using positron emission tomography (PET) would predict symptom reduction after cognitive behavior therapy (behavior). Nine SAD patients were examined using high-resolution PET and the high-affinity D2-R antagonist radioligand [C-11]FLB 457, before and after 15 weeks of CBT. Symptom levels were assessed using the anxiety subscale of Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS(anx)). At posttreatment, there was a statistically significant reduction of social anxiety symptoms (Po0.005). Using a repeated measures analysis of covariance, significant effects for time and time x LSAS(anx) change on D2-R-binding potential (BPND) were shown (P<0.05). In a subsequent region-by-region analysis, negative correlations between change in D2-R BPND and LSAS(anx) change were found for medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus (P<0.05). This is the first study to report a direct relationship between symptom change after psychological treatment and a marker of brain P<0.05. Using an intra-individual comparison design, the study supports a role for the dopamine system in cortical and limbic brain regions in the pathophysiology of SAD.

Behavioral effects of elevated expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 in mice	BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Real time PCR; Adenosine receptor; Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1; Caffeine; Ethanol	CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ADENOSINE UPTAKE; ETHANOL; RECEPTORS; NEURONS; BRAIN; ASTROCYTES; HENT1; PCR	Adenosine concentrations are regulated by purinergic enzymes and nucleoside transporters. Transgenic mice with neuronal expression of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) have been generated (Parkinson et al., 2009 [7]). The present study tested the hypothesis that mice homozygous and heterozygous for the transgene exhibit differences in hENT1 mRNA and protein expression, and in behavioral responses to caffeine and ethanol, two drugs with adenosine-dependent actions. Real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify mice heterozygous and homozygous for the transgene. Gene expression, determined by real time PCR of cDNA reverse transcribed from cerebral cortex RNA, was 3.8-fold greater in homozygous mice. Protein abundance, determined by radioligand binding assays using 0.14 nM [H-3]S-(4-nitrobenzyl)-6-thioinosine ([H-3]NBTI), was up to 84% greater in cortex synaptosome membranes from homozygous than from heterozygous mice. In western blots with an antibody specific for hENT1, a protein of approximately 40 kDa was strongly labelled in cortex samples from homozygous mice, weakly labelled in samples from heterozygous mice and absent from samples from wild type mice. In behavioral assays, transgenic mice showed a greater response to ethanol and a reduced response to caffeine than wild type littermates; however, no significant differences between heterozygous and homozygous mice were detected. These data indicate that the difference in ENT1 function between wild type and heterozygous mice was greater than that between heterozygous and homozygous mice. Therefore, either heterozygous or homozygous hENT1 transgenic mice can be used in studies of ENT1 regulation of adenosine levels and adenosine dependent behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Quantitative pharmacological analysis of antagonist binding kinetics at CRF<sub>1</sub> receptors <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						CRF1; receptor occupancy; kinetics; SN003; DMP904; R121919; association rate (k(on)); dissociation rate (k(off))	CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; NONPEPTIDE ANTAGONIST; LIGAND-BINDING; RESIDENCE TIME; PEPTIDE; POTENT; ASSOCIATION; RADIOLIGAND; DEPRESSION; PROTEINS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE A series of novel non-peptide corticotropin releasing factor type-1 receptor (CRF1) antagonists were found to display varying degrees of insurmountable and non-competitive behaviour in functional in vitro assays. We describe how we attempted to relate this behaviour to ligand receptor-binding kinetics in a quantitative manner and how this resulted in the development and implementation of an efficient pharmacological screening method based on principles described by Motulsky and Mahan. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH A non-equilibrium binding kinetic assay was developed to determine the receptor binding kinetics of non-peptide CRF1 antagonists. Nonlinear, mixed-effects modelling was used to obtain estimates of the compounds association and dissociation rates. We present an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) approach, whereby the time course of in vivo CRF1 receptor binding of novel compounds can be predicted on the basis of in vitro assays. KEY RESULTS The non-competitive antagonist behaviour appeared to be correlated to the CRF1 receptor off-rate kinetics. The integrated PKPD model suggested that, at least in a qualitative manner, the in vitro assay can be used to triage and select compounds for further in vivo investigations. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS This study provides evidence for a link between ligand offset kinetics and insurmountable/non-competitive antagonism at the CRF1 receptor. The exact molecular pharmacological nature of this association remains to be determined. In addition, we have developed a quantitative framework to study and integrate in vitro and in vivo receptor binding kinetic behaviour of CRF1 receptor antagonists in an efficient manner in a drug discovery setting.

These complexes are thought to play important roles in modulating class A GPCR function. Many studies suggest that residues located on the "outer" (lipid-facing) surface of the transmembrane (TM) receptor core are critically involved in the formation of class A receptor dimers (oligomers). However, no clear consensus has emerged regarding the identity of the TM helices or TM subsegments involved in this process. To shed light on this issue, we have used the M-3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M3R), a prototypic class A GPCR, as a model system. Using a comprehensive and unbiased approach, we subjected all outward-facing residues (70 amino acids total) of the TM helical bundle (TM1-7) of the M3R to systematic alanine substitution mutagenesis. We then characterized the resulting mutant receptors in radioligand binding and functional studies and determined their ability to form dimers (oligomers) in bioluminescence resonance energy transfer saturation assays. We found that M3R/M3R interactions are not dependent on the presence of one specific structural motif but involve the outer surfaces of multiple TM subsegments (TM1-5 and -7) located within the central and endofacial portions of the TM receptor core. Moreover, we demonstrated that the outward-facing surfaces of most TM helices play critical roles in proper receptor folding and/or function. Guided by the bioluminescence resonance energy transfer data, molecular modeling studies suggested the existence of multiple dimeric/oligomeric M3R arrangements, which may exist in a dynamic equilibrium. Given the high structural homology found among all class A GPCRs, our results should be of considerable general relevance.

Effect of cyclosporin A on the uptake of D<sub>3</sub>-selective PET radiotracers in rat brain	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						D-3 receptors; PET; Radiotracer; P-glycoprotein	D-3 RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST; DOPAMINE D3 RECEPTOR; ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; SEROTONIN 5-HT1A RECEPTORS; P-GLYCOPROTEIN FUNCTION; IN-VIVO; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; THERAPEUTIC AGENTS; RODENT BRAIN; MONKEY BRAIN	Introduction: Four benzamide analogs having a high affinity and selectivity for D-3 versus D-2 receptors were radiolabeled with C-11 or F-18 for in vivo evaluation. Methods: Precursors were synthesized, and the four D-3 selective benzamide analogs were radiolabeled. The tissue distribution and brain uptake of the four compounds were evaluated in control rats and rats pretreated with cyclosporin A, a modulator of P-glycoprotein and an inhibitor of other ABC efflux transporters that contribute to the blood brain barrier. Micro-positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging was carried out for [C-11]6 in a control and a cyclosporin A pretreated rat. Results: All four compounds showed low brain uptake in control rats at 5 and 30 min post-injection; despite recently reported rat behavioral studies conducted on analogs 6 (WC-10) and 7 (WC-44). Following administration of cyclosporin A, increased brain uptake was observed with all four PET radiotracers at both 5 and 30 min post-intravenous injection. An increase in brain uptake following modulation/inhibition of the ABC transporters was also observed in the microPET study. Conclusions: These data suggest that D3 selective con formationally-flexible benzamide analogs which contain a N-2-methoxyphenylpiperazine moiety are substrates for P-glycoprotein or other adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters expressed at the blood-brain barrier, and that PET radiotracers containing this pharmacophore may display low brain uptake in rodents due to the action of these efflux transporters.

We developed two new PET ligands, F-18-PBR06 and C-11-PBR28, to image TSPOs. Although our prior studies suggest that either of the two ligands could be used to quantify TSPOs in human brain, the studies were done in different sets of subjects. In this study, we directly compared F-18-PBR06 and C-11-PBR28 in eight human subjects to determine (1) whether either ligand provides more precise measurements of TSPOs and (2) whether the higher in vitro affinity of PBR06 compared to PBR28 led to higher in vivo binding of F-18-PBR06 compared to C-11-PBR28. In vivo binding was calculated as total distribution volume (V (T)), using an unconstrained two-tissue compartment model. V (T) was corrected for plasma free fraction (f (P)) to measure ligand binding based on free ligand concentration in brain. Both ligands measured V (T) with similar precision, as evidenced by similarly good identifiability. However, V (T) for both radioligands increased with increasing lengths of data acquisition, consistent with the accumulation of radiometabolites in brain. Despite its higher lipophilicity and higher in vitro affinity, V (T)/f (P) of F-18-PBR06 was similar to that of C-11-PBR28. Both F-18-PBR06 and C-11-PBR28 are similar in terms of precision, sensitivity to accumulation of radiometabolites, and magnitude of in vivo binding. Thus, selection between the two radioligands will be primarily determined by the logistical impact of the different half-lives of the two radionuclides (110 vs 20 min).

The use of alternative forms of graphical analysis to balance bias and precision in PET images	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						distribution volume; distribution volume ratio; graphical analysis; instrumental variable; modeling; positron emission tomography	REVERSIBLE RADIOLIGAND BINDING; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SEROTONIN TRANSPORTER; REGRESSION-ANALYSIS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; NEURORECEPTOR; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; IMPROVE; NOISE	Graphical analysis (GA) is an efficient method for estimating total tissue distribution volume (V(T)) from positron emission tomography (PET) uptake data. The original GA produces a negative bias in V(T) in the presence of noise. Estimates of V(T) using other GA forms have less bias but less precision. Here, we show how the bias terms are related between the GA methods and how using an instrumental variable (IV) can also reduce bias. Results are based on simulations of a two-compartment model with V(T)'s ranging from 10.5 to 64 mL/cm(3) and from PET image data with the tracer [(11)C] DASB ([(11)C]-3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfanyl) benzonitrile). Four estimates of V(T) (or distribution volume ratio (DVR) using a reference tissue) can be easily computed from different formulations of GA including the IV. As noise affects the estimates from all four differently, they generally do not provide the same estimates. By taking the median value of the four estimates, we can decrease the bias and reduce the effect of large values contributing to noisy images. The variance of the four estimates can serve as a guide to the reliability of the median estimate. This may provide a general method for the generation of parametric images with little bias and good precision.

Membrane Cholesterol Modulates the Outward Facing Conformation of the Dopamine Transporter and Alters Cocaine Binding	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID TRANSPORTER; TRANSMEMBRANE DOMAIN-I; LIPID RAFTS; NEUROTRANSMITTER TRANSPORTERS; MONOAMINE TRANSPORTERS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CELL-MEMBRANES; PROTEIN; PHOSPHORYLATION	Clearance of synaptically released dopamine is regulated by the plasmalemmal dopamine transporter (DAT), an integral membrane protein that resides within a complex lipid milieu. Here we demonstrate that cholesterol, a major component of the lipid bilayer, can modulate the conformation of DAT and alter cocaine binding to DAT. In striatal synaptosomes and transfected cells, DAT was in cholesterol-rich membrane fractions after mild detergent extraction. After increasing the membrane cholesterol content by treatment of water-soluble cholesterol (cholesterol mixed with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin), we observed an increase in DAT binding B-max values for cocaine analogs [H-3]WIN35428 and [I-125]RTI-55, but similar levels of DAT proteins on the cell surface were shown by surface biotinylation assays. Membrane cholesterol addition also markedly enhanced the accessibility of cysteine sulfhydryl moieties in DAT as probed by a membrane-impermeable maleimide-biotin conjugate. We identified cysteine 306, a juxtamembrane residue on transmembrane domain 6 (TM6) of DAT, as the intrinsic residue exhibiting enhanced reactivity. Similar effects on DAT cysteine accessibility and radioligand binding were observed with addition of zinc, a reagent known to promote the outward facing conformation of DAT. Using substituted cysteine mutants on various positions likely to be extracellular, we identified additional residues located on TM1, TM6, TM7, and TM12 of DAT that are sensitive to alterations in the membrane cholesterol content. Our findings in transfected cells and native tissues support the hypothesis that DAT adopts an outward facing conformation in a cholesterol-rich membrane environment, suggesting a novel modulatory role of the surrounding membrane lipid milieu on DAT function.

To determine the binding site of QR2 for melatonin, point mutations of residues Crucial for the enzymatic activity of hQR2 were performed. The substitution of the hydrophobic residues Phe126, Ile128 and Phe178 by tyrosines at the active site significantly increased enzymatic activity and decreased the affinity of a structural analog of melatonin, the 2[I-125]iodo-MCANAT. The mutation of residues implicated in zinc chelating (His(173); His(177)) had no effect on radioligand binding. Destabilisation of the cofactor FAD by mutation N18E showed that 2[I-125]iodo-MCANAT binding was closely linked to the conformational integrity of human QR2. Surprisingly, the mutations C222F and N161A, which are distant from the determined binding site of the ligand, increased the affinity of 2[I-125]iodo-MCANAT for hQR2. What seems to better explain the binding variations among the mutants are the activity recorded with BNAH and coenzyme Q1. Various hypotheses are discussed based on the various parameters used in the study: nature of the substrates and co-substrates and nature of the amino acid changes. This study, which constitutes the first structural analysis of hQR2, should enable to better understand the biological role of melatonin on this enzyme and particularly, the discrepancies between the pharmacologies of the melatonin binding site (MT3) and the QR2 catalytic activity.

First, we compared the regional distribution and biochemical parameters of alpha(2)-ARs in SHRs and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, using the full agonist [H-3]UK 14304. Secondly, we evaluated the effect of selective blockade and stimulation of(alpha(2)-ARs on the development of hypertension and on renal (alpha(2)-AR density and regional distribution in SHRs. [H-3]UK 14304 binding was distributed predominantly over the outer medulla, less abundantly over the inner medulla and was almost absent from the renal cortex. Renal (X2-ARs were found to be increased in SHRs at the ages tested compared with their respective controls and the increase was completely localized to the outer medulla. In these rats, blood pressures immediately before sacrifice were significantly higher in the hypertensive group compared with normotensive controls. The daily administration of SK&F 86466 or clonidine significantly decreased the blood pressure but the autoradiographic studies showed that the prolonged administration of yohimbine to rats for two weeks resulted in a large increase in the density Of alpha(2)-ARs in some areas of the rat kidney but not in others. Taken together these data do not support the hypothesis that alteration in renal a2-ARs (as measured by autoradiography) is crucial for the maintenance of hypertension in the SHR model.

GABA<sub>A</sub> α6-containing receptors are selectively compromised in cerebellar granule cells of the ataxic mouse, stargazer	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; SUBUNIT MESSENGER-RNAS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; DELTA-SUBUNIT; A RECEPTOR; MUTANT MOUSE; QUANTITATIVE IMPORTANCE; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; SYNAPTIC INHIBITION; BETA-3 SUBUNITS	Stargazer mice fail to express the gamma 2 isoform of transmembrane alpha-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate ( AMPA) receptor regulatory proteins that has been shown to be absolutely required for the trafficking and synaptic targeting of excitatory AMPA receptors in adult murine cerebellar granule cells. Here we show that 30 +/- 6% fewer inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid, type A (GABA(A)), receptors were expressed in adult stargazer cerebellum compared with controls because of a specific loss of GABAA receptor expression in the cerebellar granule cell layer. Radioligand binding assays allied to in situ immunogold-EM analysis and furosemide-sensitive tonic current estimates revealed that expression of the extrasynaptic (alpha 6 beta x delta) alpha 6-containing GABA(A) receptor were markedly and selectively reduced in stargazer. These observations were compatible with a marked reduction in expression of GABAA receptor alpha 6,delta (mature cerebellar granule cell-specific proteins), and beta 3 subunit expression in stargazer. The subunit composition of the residual alpha 6-containing GABA(A) receptors was unaffected by the stargazer mutation. However, we did find evidence of an similar to 4-fold up-regulation of alpha 1 beta delta receptors that may compensate for the loss of alpha 6-containing GABA(A) receptors. PCR analysis identified a dramatic reduction in the steady-state level of alpha 6 mRNA, compatible with alpha 6 being the primary target of the stargazer mutation-mediated GABAA receptor abnormalities. We propose that some aspects of assembly, trafficking, targeting, and/or expression of extrasynaptic alpha 6-containing GABA(A) receptors in cerebellar granule cells are selectively regulated by AMPA receptor-mediated signaling.

Initial fluorine-18-labelling of LBT-999 was based on the robust and reliable two-step radiochemical pathway often reported for such tropane derivatives, involving first the preparation of (E)-1-[(18)F]fluoro-4-tosyloxybut-2-ene followed by a N-alkylation reaction with the appropriate nor-tropane moiety. In the present work, a simple one-step fluorine-18-labelling of LBT-999 is reported, based on a chlorine-for-fluorine nucleophilic aliphatic substitution, facilitating as expected both automation and final high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification. The process involves: (A) reaction of K[(18)F]F-Kryptofix((R))222 with the chlorinated precursor (3.5-4.5mg) at 165 degrees C for 10min in DMSO (0.6mL) followed by (B) C-18 PrepSep cartridge pre-purification and finally (C) semi-preparative HPLC purification on a Waters Syrnmetry((R)) C-18. Typically, 3.70-5.92GBq of [(18)F]LBT-999 (> 95% chemically and radiochernically pure) could be obtained with specific radioactivities ranging from 37 to 111GBq/mu mol within 85-90 min (HPLC purification and Sep-Pak-based formulation included), starting from a 37.0 GBq [(18)F]fluoride batch (overall radiochemical yields: 10-16%, non-decay-corTected).

J	Sircar, R; Sircar, D				Sircar, Ratna; Sircar, Debashish			Repeated ethanol treatment in adolescent rats alters cortical NMDA receptor	ALCOHOL			English	Article						juvenile; alcoholism; radioligand binding; glutamatergic system; brain maturation	D-ASPARTATE RECEPTOR; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; H-3 MK-801 BINDING; SPATIAL MEMORY; UP-REGULATION; IN-VIVO; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; DEVELOPMENTAL SWITCH; IONOPHORE COMPLEX	Earlier we have reported that repeated ethanol treatment during adolescence causes long-lasting impairments in spatial learning and memory. The present study was undertaken to determine the cellular mechanisms underlying the persistent ethanol-induced cognitive dysfunction in adolescent male rats. Since in adult animals ethanol is known to affect the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-gated ion channel, the hypothesis tested here was that adolescent ethanol exposure modulates NMDA receptor (NR) regulation in the brain. Adolescent male rats were injected daily with ethanol (2 g/kg intraperitoneally) for 5 consecutive days. Control rats received isovolumetric saline for the same number of days. Groups of control and experimental rats were sacrificed 7 days after the last ethanol/saline administration, and NR activity was measured in specific brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus) using the [H-3]MK-801 binding assay. In addition, some rats were sacrificed and their brains were used to investigate changes in NR pharmacology by measuring specific NR2 subunits immunohistochemically. Compared to saline-treated controls, ethanol-treated rats showed significant increases in [H-3]MK-801 maximal binding in the frontal cortex. This was associated with increased cortical NR2B subunit protein: [H-3]MK-801 binding in the hippocampus was minimally affected. These results indicate that ethanol exposure during the adolescent period produces brain region-specific alterations in NR activity. These changes are different from those reported in literature for ethanol administration during the perinatal period or adulthood. Together, these data suggest that adolescence represents a unique stage in brain development in its long-term sensitivity to ethanol. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We investigated the potential of genistein to modulate androgen receptor (AR) expression and transcriptional activity in the human androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Materials and Methods: AR expression at mRNA and protein level was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblot, respectively. In conditioned media PSA was measured by a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (MEIA). Binding of genistein to the AR was tested in a radioligand-binding assay and reporter gene co-transfection assay was employed to investigate AR activity. Results: Using concentrations of genistein that have been detected in sera of Asian men on regular soy-diet we found down-regulation of androgen receptor at both mRNA and protein level. The relative binding affinity to the AR was below 4% when compared to methyltrienologe (R1881) and there was no modulation of AR transcriptional activity by genistein concentrations up to 1 muM. We also demonstrated inhibition of PSA secretion after genistein treatment. As the anti-estrogen ICI 164 384 abolished the inhibitory effect of genistein and ER-beta, but not ER-alpha is expressed in LNCaP cells we postulate that the mechanism of genistein action on androgen receptor is mediated through ER-P. Conclusion: Using physiological concentrations of genistein we showed AR down-regulation by genistein in prostate cancer cells occurring via ER-P. This likely results in a modified response to hormonal stimuli and may help to explain the low incidence of prostate cancer in the Asian population. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One circulating subfraction, electronegative LDL (LDL(-)), which is increased in familial hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, is implicated in accelerated atherosclerosis. Cellular responses to LDL(-) remain poorly described. Here we demonstrate that LDL(-) increases tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)-induced inflammatory responses through NFkappaB and AP-1 activation with corresponding increases in vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) expression. LDL receptor overexpression increased these effects. In contrast, exposing LDL(-) to the key lipolytic enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) reversed these responses, inhibiting VCAM1 below levels seen with TNFalpha alone. LPL is known to act on lipoproteins to generate endogenous peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) ligand, thus limiting inflammation. These responses varied according to the lipoprotein substrate triglyceride content (very low density lipoprotein >> LDL > high density lipoprotein). The PPARalpha activation seen with LDL, however, was disproportionately high. We show here that MUT LDL activates PPARalpha to an extent proportional to its LDL(-) content. As compared with LDL(-) alone, LPL-treated LDL(-) increased PPARalpha activation 20-fold in either cell-based transfection or radioligand displacement assays. LPL-treated LDL(-) suppressed NFkappaB and AP-1 activation, increasing expression of the PPARalpha target gene IkappaBalpha, although only in the genetic presence of PPARalpha and with intact LPL hydrolysis. Mass spectrometry reveals that LPL-treatment of either LDL or LDL(-) releases hydroxy-octadecadienoic acids (HODEs), potent PPARalpha activators. These findings suggest LPL-mediated PPARalpha activation as an alternative catabolic pathway that may limit inflammatory responses to LDL(-).

Therefore, we developed a radiosynthesis for the dopamine D-2,D-3 partial agonist (R)-N- [1-C-11]n-propylnorapomorphine ([C-11]NPA). The uptake of this tracer in brain of anesthetized Gottingen miniature pigs was recorded by positron emission tomography (PET) and analyzed by compartmental analysis using the metabolite-corrected arterial input, and using reference tissue methods. [C-11]NPA had a blood-brain unidirectional clearance of approximately 0.35 ml g(-1) min(-1) and an apparent distribution volume of 6 ml g(-1) in cerebellum. The ligand had a binding potential of 1.5 in striatum, comparable to that reported previously for the receptor antagonist [C-11]raclopride in the same strain of animals. Significant binding was detected in the hypophysis, thalamus, and medial forebrain bundle. The binding in striatum was of comparable magnitude in normal pigs and in pigs with a documented 50% dopamine depletion produced by MPTP-intoxication. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamus was without conspicuous effect on the binding of [C-11]NPA in vivo. Results of this preliminary study indicate that this tracer meets many requirements for assaying dopamine agonist binding sites by PET. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Meissner, O; Häberlein, H				Meissner, O; Häberlein, H			Lateral mobility and specific binding to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors on hippocampal neurons monitored by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							RAT-BRAIN; BENZODIAZEPINE RECEPTORS; GAMMA-2 SUBUNIT; A RECEPTORS; ACID; RETINA; CELLS; MEMBRANES; <H-3>MUSCIMOL; ASSOCIATION	The binding behavior of a fluorescently labeled muscimol derivative to the GABA(A) receptor was analyzed at rat hippocampal neurons by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. After muscimol had been labeled with the fluorophore Alexa Fluor 532, specific binding constants for binding of the dye-labeled ligand (Mu-Alexa) to the GABAA receptor were determined. We found a high specific binding affinity of Mu-Alexa with a K-D value of 3.4 +/- 0.5 nM and a rate constant of ligand-receptor dissociation (k(diss)) of (5.37 +/- 0.95) x 10(-2) s(-1). A rate constant of ligand-receptor association (k(ass)) of (1.57 +/- 0.28) x 10(7) L mol(-1) s(-1) was calculated. The following diffusion coefficients were observed: D-free = 233 +/- 20 mum(2)/s (n = 66) for free diffusing Mu-Alexa, D-bound1 = 2.8 +/- 0.9 mum(2)/s (n = 64) for the lateral mobility, and D-bound2 = 0.14 +/- 0.05 mum(2)/s (n = 56) for the hindered mobility of the GABAA receptor-ligand complex in the cell membrane. Saturation of Mu-Alexa binding was observed at a concentration of 50 nM. A maximum number of binding sites [B-max = 18.4 +/- 0.4 nM (n = 5)] was found. Similar K-i values, of 4.5 +/- 1.0 nM for nonlabeled muscimol and 8.8 +/- 1.8 nM for Mu-Alexa were found by RRAs using [H-3]muscimol as a radioligand.

In a search for radiopharmaceuticals with unique imaging applications using positron emission tomography (PET), we have also developed three new phenylcarboxamide analogues of FCWAY Two of these analogues were generated by replacing the fluorocyclohexane carboxylic acid with fluorobenzoic acid (FBWAY) or with 3-methyl-4-fluorobenzoic acid (MeFBWAY). The final analogue was generated by replacing the pyridyl group with a pyrimidyl group and the fluorocyclohexane carboxylate with fluorobenzoic acid (FPWAY). We evaluated the metabolic profile of these compounds using either human or rat hepatocytes to produce metabolites and LC-MS/MS to identify these metabolites. We also compared the metabolic rate of these compounds in human or rat hepatocytes. These in vitro metabolism studies indicate that hydrolysis of the amide linkage was the major metabolic pathway for FPWAY and FBWAY in human hepatocytes, whereas aromatic oxidation is the major metabolic pathway for MeFBWAY The comparative metabolic rate in human hepatocytes was FPWAY>FBWAY> MeFBWAY In rat hepatocytes, aromatic oxidation was the major metabolic pathway for all three analogs and the rate of this process was similar for all of the analogues. These in vitro metabolic studies demonstrated species differences prior to the acquisition and interpretation of in vivo results. Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Fusion of beta-arrestin1 to the C-terminal end of the neurokinin NK1 receptor resulted in a chimeric protein that was expressed to some extent on the cell surface but also accumulated in transferrin-labeled recycling endosomes independently of agonist stimulation. As expected, the fusion protein was almost totally silenced with respect to agonist-induced signaling through the normal Gq/G(11) and Gs pathways. The NK1-beta-arrestin1 fusion construct bound non-peptide antagonists with increased affinity but surprisingly also bound two types of agonists, substance P and neurokinin A, with high, normal affinity. In the wild-type NK1 receptor, neurokinin A (NKA) competes for binding against substance P and especially against antagonists with up to 1000-fold lower apparent affinity than determined in functional assays and in homologous binding assays. When the NK1 receptor was closely fused to G proteins, this phenomenon was eliminated among agonists, but the agonists still competed with low affinity against antagonists. In contrast, in the NK1-beta-arrestin1 fusion protein, all ligands bound with similar affinity independent of the choice of radioligand and with Hill coefficients near unity. We conclude that the NK1 receptor in complex with arrestin is in a high-affinity, stable, agonist-binding form probably best suited to structural analysis and that the receptor can display binding properties that are nearly theoretically ideal when it is forced to complex with only a single intracellular protein partner.

Compounds were synthesized by condensation of a number of available arylpiperazines or heteroarylpiperazines with 2-bromoethyl 4-amino-5-chloro-2-methoxybenzoate. They were evaluated in binding assays on the recently cloned human 5-HT4(e) isoform stably expressed in C6 glial cells with [H-3]GR 113808 as the radioligand. The affinity values (K-i) depended upon the substituent on the aromatic ring. A chlorine atom produced a marked drop in activity (K-i > 100 nM), while a m-methoxy group gave a compound with nanomolar affinity (K-i = 3 nM). The most potent compounds were the heterocyclic derivatives with pyrimidine, pyrazine, pyridazine, or pyridine moieties (compounds 9r, 9t, 9u, 9x, respectively). K-i values for 9a and 9r were determined for the 5-HT4(a), 5-HT4(b), 5-HT4(c), and 5-HT4(d) receptor isoforms transiently expressed in COS cells. The results indicated that the compounds were not selective. They produced an inhibition of the 5-HT-stimulated cyclic AMP synthesis in the C6 glial cells stably expressing the 5-HT4(e) receptor and shifted the 5-HT concentration-effect curve on adenylyl cyclase activity with pK(D) values of 7.44 and 8.47, respectively. In isolated human atrial myocytes, 9r antagonized the stimulatory effect of 5-HT on the L-type calcium current (I-Ca) with a K-D value of 0.7 nM.

J	Lansdell, SJ; Millar, NS				Lansdell, SJ; Millar, NS			The influence of nicotinic receptor subunit composition upon agonist, α-bungarotoxin and insecticide (imidacloprid) binding affinity	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						nicotinic receptor; insecticide binding; imidacloprid; epibatidine; alpha-bungarotoxin	CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; BETA-SUBUNIT; GENE FAMILY; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; RAT; SENSITIVITY; EPIBATIDINE	A series of cell lines stably expressing recombinant nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) has been established by transfection of mammalian (rat) and insect (Drosophila) nicotinic subunit cDNAs. By equilibrium radioligand binding, we have examined the influence of individual subunits upon the affinity of two nicotinic agonists (epibatidine and methylcarbamylcholine), an antagonist (the snake neurotoxin, alpha-bungarotoxin) and a recently developed chloronicotinyl insecticide (imidacloprid). Imidacloprid bound with very low affinity to the rat alpha 4/beta 2 nAChR but did so with high affinity to hybrid nACRs containing Drosophila a subunits co-assembled with rat beta 2. Of the subunit combinations examined, imidacloprid showed highest affinity binding to nAChRs containing the recently identified Drosophila a subunit, D alpha 3, co-assembled with beta 2. In contrast, no specific binding of imidacloprid was detected when Da3 was co-expressed with the mammalian neuronal beta 4 subunit, or with the muscle-type (gamma or delta) subunits. However, despite the absence of imidacloprid binding to D alpha 3/beta 4, D alpha 3/gamma or D alpha 3/delta, these subunit combinations all exhibited high affinity binding of other nicotinic radioligands. Epibatidine showed substantially higher affinity binding to subunit combinations containing neuronal (beta 2 or beta 4) subunits than it did to combinations containing muscle-type (gamma or delta) subunits. In contrast, alpha-bungarotoxin bound with higher affinity to combinations containing muscle-type subunits. Our results demonstrate that both alpha and non-alpha subunits exert a profound influence upon the affinity of nicotinic ligands for recombinant nAChRs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

However, heterogeneity in immunohistochemistry indicates limitations in the effect of imaging and radionuclide therapy of multifocal disease. 99mTc-PSMA-I&S is a gamma-emitting probe, which can be used for intraoperative lesion detection and postsurgical autoradiography (ARG). We aimed to study its intraprostatic distribution and compared it with (immuno)-histopathology.Results Seventeen patients who underwent RGS between 11/2018 and 01/2020 with a total of 4660 grids were included in the preliminary analysis. Marked intratumor and intra-patient heterogeneity of PSMA expression was detected, and PSMA negative foci were observed in all samples (100%). Heterogeneous intra-patient PSMA-ligand uptake was observed, and no significant correlation was present between the degree of heterogeneity of PSMA expression and PSMA-ligand uptake. Higher PSMA-ligand uptake was observed in GS >= 8 than GS < 8 (p < 0.001). The appearance of Gleason Pattern (GP) 4 was strongly associated with higher uptake (coefficient: 0.43, p < 0.001), while GP 5 also affected the uptake (coefficient: 0.07, p < 0.001).Conclusion PSMA expression and PSMA-ligand uptake show marked heterogeneity. Prostate carcinoma with GP 4 showed significantly higher uptake compared with non-neoplastic prostate tissue. Our analyses extend the scope of applications of radiolabeled PSMA-ligands to ARG for identifying high-grade disease and using its signal as a noninvasive biomarker in prostate cancer.

However, improvement is still needed, and targeted alpha therapy (TAT) with alpha emitters such as lead-212 (Pb-212) represents a promising avenue. A series of ligands based on octreotate was developed. Lead-203 was used as an imaging surrogate for the selection of the best candidate for the studies with lead-212. Pb-203/212 radiolabeling and in vitro assays were carried out, followed by SPECT/CT imaging and ex vivo biodistribution in NCI-H69 tumor-bearing mice. High radiochemical yields (=99%) and purity (=96%) were obtained for all ligands. [Pb-203]Pb-eSOMA-01 and [Pb-203]Pb-eSOMA-02 showed high stability in PBS and mouse serum up to 24 h, whereas [Pb-203]Pb-eSOMA-03 was unstable in those conditions. All compounds exhibited a nanomolar affinity (2.5-3.1 nM) for SSTR2. SPECT/CT images revealed high tumor uptake at 1, 4, and 24 h post-injection of [Pb-203]Pb-eSOMA-01/02. Ex vivo biodistribution studies confirmed that the highest uptake in tumors was observed with [Pb-212]Pb-eSOMA-01. [Pb-212]Pb-eESOMA-01 displayed the highest absorbed dose in the tumor (35.49 Gy/MBq) and the lowest absorbed dose in the kidneys (121.73 Gy/MBq) among the three tested radioligands. [Pb-212]Pb-eSOMA-01 is a promising candidate for targeted alpha therapy of NETs. Further investigations are required to confirm its potential.

We discovered FAP expression at immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the alpha cells of the Langerhans insulae of few patients. Therefore, we planned an investigation aimed at describing FAP expression in the pancreas and discussing the implications for radioligand applications.MethodsWe retrospectively included 40 patients from 2 institutions (20 pts each) according to the following inclusion/exclusion criteria: (i) pathology proven pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine tumors (NET), 10 pts per each group at each center; (ii) and availability of paraffin-embedded tissue; and (iii) clinical-pathological records. We performed IHC analysis and applied a semiquantitative visual scoring system (0, negative staining; 1, present in less than 30%; 2, present in more than 30% of the area). FAP expression was assessed according to histology-NET (n = 20) vs ductal adenocarcinoma (n = 20)-and to previous treatments within the adenocarcinoma group. The local ethics committee approved the study (No. INT 21/16, 28 January 2016).ResultsThe population consisted of 24 males and 16 females, with a median age of 68 and a range of 14-84 years; 8/20 adenocarcinoma patients received chemotherapy. In all the Langerhans insulae (40/40), pancreatic alpha cells were found to express FAP, with a score of 2. No difference was found among NET (20/20) and adenocarcinoma (20/20), nor according to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the adenocarcinoma cohort (received or not received).ConclusionPancreatic Langerhans islet alpha cells normally express FAP.

Overcoming COVID-19 Network	NFKB2 haploinsufficiency identified via screening for IFN-a2 autoantibodies in children and adolescents hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2-related complications	JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Anti-interferon autoantibody; COVID-19; MIS-C; NFKB2; inborn errors of immunity		Background: Autoantibodies against type I IFNs occur in approximately 10% of adults with life-threatening coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The frequency of anti-IFN autoantibodies in children with severe sequelae of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is unknown. Objective: We quantified anti-type I IFN autoantibodies in a multicenter cohort of children with severe COVID-19, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections. Methods: Circulating anti-IFN-a2 antibodies were measured by a radioligand binding assay. Whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and functional studies of peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used to study any patients with levels of anti-IFN-a2 autoantibodies exceeding the assay's positive control. Results: Among 168 patients with severe COVID-19, 199 with MIS-C, and 45 with mild SARS-CoV-2 infections, only 1 had high levels of anti-IFN-a2 antibodies. Anti-IFN-a2 autoantibodies were not detected in patients treated with intravenous immunoglobulin before sample collection. Whole-exome sequencing identified a missense variant in the ankyrin domain of NFKB2, encoding the p100 subunit of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain enhancer of activated B cells, aka NF-kB, essential for noncanonical NF-kB signaling. The patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells exhibited impaired cleavage of p100 characteristic of NFKB2 haploinsufficiency, an inborn error of immunity with a high prevalence of autoimmunity. Conclusions: High levels of anti-IFN-a2 autoantibodies in children and adolescents with MIS-C, severe COVID-19, and mild SARS-CoV-2 infections are rare but can occur in patients with inborn errors of immunity.

We hypothesize that 6-[F-18]FDF will specifically image microglia following neuroinflammatory insult. 6-[F-18]FDF and, for comparison, [F-18]FDG were evaluated in unilateral intra-striatal lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-injected male and female rats (50 mu g/animal) by longitudinal dynamic PET imaging in vivo. In LPS-injected rats, increased accumulation of 6-[F-18]FDF was observed at 48 h post-LPS injection, with plateaued uptake (60-120 min) that was significantly higher in the ipsilateral vs. contralateral striatum (0.985 +/- 0.047 and 0.819 +/- 0.033 SUV, respectively; p = 0.002, n = 4M/3F). The ipsilateral-contralateral difference in striatal 6-[F-18]FDF uptake expressed as binding potential (BPSRTM) peaked at 48 h (0.19 +/- 0.11) and was significantly decreased at one and two weeks. In contrast, increased [F-18]FDG uptake in the ipsilateral striatum was highest at one week post-LPS injection (BPSRTM = 0.25 +/- 0.06, n = 4M). Iba-1 and GFAP immunohistochemistry confirmed LPS-induced activation of microglia and astrocytes, respectively, in ipsilateral striatum. This proof-of-concept study revealed an early response of 6-[F-18]FDF to neuroinflammatory stimuli in rat brain. 6-[F-18]FDF represents a potential PET radiotracer for imaging microglial GLUT5 density in brain with applications in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases.

Inconsistent results have been reported from positron emission tomography (PET) studies using different radioligands to examine relationships between age, gender and body mass index (BMI) and CB1R availability in healthy individuals. In this study, we examined these variables in 58 healthy individuals (age range: 18-55 years; 44 male; BMI=27.01 +/- 5.56), the largest cohort of subjects studied to date using the CB1R PET ligand [C-11]OMAR. There was a significant decline in CB1R availability (V-T) with age in the pallidum, cerebellum and posterior cingulate. Adjusting for BMI, age-related decline in V-T remained significant in the posterior cingulate among males, and in the cerebellum among women. CB1R availability was higher in women compared to men in the thalamus, pallidum and posterior cingulate. Adjusting for age, CB1R availability negatively correlated with BMI in women but not men. These findings differ from those reported using [C-11]OMAR and other radioligands such as [F-18]FMPEP-d(2) and [F-18]MK-9470. Although reasons for these seemingly divergent findings are unclear, the choice of PET radioligand and range of BMI in the current dataset may contribute to the observed differences. This study highlights the need for cross-validation studies using both [C-11]OMAR and [F-18]FMPEP-d(2) within the same cohort of subjects.

Central activation of the mu and/or kappa opioid receptors (KOR) is associated with CNS side effects, which limits their effectiveness. Recent studies indicated that peripherally restricted, selective KOR agonists were potent analgesics and devoid of CNS-related side effects. To confirm this hypothesis, we designed a novel, potent, and peripherally restricted KOR-selective agonist, ZYKR1. The analgesic efficacy, brain penetration and safety of ZYKR1 were assessed in pre-clinical models. ZYKR1 showed KOR agonistic activity in the cAMP assay, with an EC50 of 0.061 nM and more than 105-fold selectivity over the mu and delta opioid receptors (EC50 > 10 mu M). ZYKR1 was not found to bind mu, delta opioid, and NOP receptors in radioligand binding assays. ZYKR1 produced concentration-dependent inhibition of electrically evoked contractions in isolated mouse vas deferens with an IC50 of 1.6 nM ZYKR1 showed peripheral restriction and potent analgesic efficacy in various in-vivo animal models (acetic acid induced visceral pain mouse model, ED50: 0.025 mg/kg, IV; ovariohysterectomy induced postoperative pain rat model, ED50: 0.023 mg/kg, IV; and C48/80 induced pruritus mouse model, ED50: 0.063 mg/kg, IV). In addition, ZYKR1 was devoid of motor coordination, physical dependence, dysphoria, and respiratory depression at 30, 400, 10 and 10-fold of efficacy dose, respectively. In conclusion, ZYKR1 has potent antinociceptive action in visceral pain and pruritus with limited CNS side effects in preclinical models owing to its peripheral restriction.

The unique metabolic characteristics of cancer cells based on higher demand for energy and therefore increased glucose utilization were exploited in the design of glucose modified liposomes (GML) with the aim to provide increased tumor targeting via glucose transporters and increased ability of drug delivery into tumor cells. Tumor accumulating potential of GML and non-glucose liposomes (NGL) were investigated on CT26 and LS174T tumor-bearing mice by simple and reliable radiotracer method using 177Lu as radioactive marker. Both liposomes, GML and NGL were radiolabeled in high radiolabeling yield, showing high in vitro stability in biological media, as the main prerequisite for the biodistribution studies. Tumors displayed significantly better accumulation of 177Lu-GML with the maximum uptake 6 h post-injection (5.8 ? 0.2%/g in LS174T tumor and 5.1 ? 0.5%/g in CT26 tumor), compared to negligible uptake of 177Lu-NGL (0.6 ? 0.1%/g in LS174T tumor and 0.9 ? 0.2%/g in CT26 tumor). Results of comparative biodistribution studies of 177Lu-NGL and 177Lu-GML indicate that increased accumulation of GML is enabled by glucose transporters and subsequent endocytosis, resulting in their prolonged retention in tumor tissues (up to 72 h). Direct radiolabeling of liposomes with 177Lu may be used not only for biodistribution studies using radiotracking, but also for cancer treatment.

Dosimetry calculations are used to assess correlations between dosimetric quantities and biomarker values. Methods The patients' age range was 74 +/- 7 years at the time of the investigated treatment cycle, and the mean injected activity was 7416 +/- 218 MBq. Planar images at several time points postinjection were used for evaluation of absorbed doses to organs and lesion.Ga-68-PSMA PET/CT follow-up imaging enabled the determination of individual tumor molecular volume (TMV) shrinkage. Changes in 7 different biomarkers after the first treatment cycle were correlated with the calculated absorbed organ and TMV doses, resulting in a total number of 259 investigated correlations. Results Sixty-three TMVs were identified in the bone, lymph node, and liver tissue with an average reduction of 32.3%, 84.7%, and 72.9%, respectively. Absorbed doses per unit of administered activity for organs and lesions show good agreement with previous works (0.77, 0.71, and 0.27 mGy/MBq for parotid gland, kidneys, and liver as well as 4.38, 5.47, and 4.95 mGy/MBq for bone, lymph node, and liver malignancies, respectively). Only 37 of 259 possible correlations turned out to be statistically significant, 26 of which are associated with the absorbed dose of an organ and the decrease of alkaline phosphatases. Conclusions Although treatment with(177)Lu-PSMA I&T leads to a big reduction of TMV in patients with mCRPC, the lack of correlations calls for studies using voxel-wise dosimetry based on SPECT/CTs.

Here, we examine replication of the lower FAAH levels in a separate, younger cohort (23 +/- 5 years of age). Eighteen healthy volunteers (HVs) and fourteen CUs underwent a positron emission tomography scan using the FAAH radioligand [C-11]CURB. Regional [C-11]CURB binding was calculated using an irreversible two-tissue compartment model with a metabolite-corrected arterial plasma input function. The FAAH C385A genetic polymorphism (rs324420) was included as a covariate. All CUs underwent a urine screen to confirm recent cannabis use and had serum cannabinoids measured. One CU screened negative for cannabinoids via serum and was removed from analysis. All HVs reported less than five lifetime cannabis exposures more than a month prior to study initiation. There was a significant effect of group (F-1,F-26 = 4.31; P = .048) when two A/A (rs324420) HVs were removed from analysis to match the genotype of the CU group (n = 16 HVs, n = 13 CUs). Overall, [C-11]CURB lambda k(3) was 12% lower in CU compared with HV. Exploratory correlations showed that lower brain [C-11]CURB binding was related to greater use of cannabis throughout the past year. We confirmed our previous report and extended these findings by detecting lower [C-11]CURB binding in a younger cohort with less cumulative cannabis exposure.

Use of virus-like particles as a native membrane model to study the interaction of insulin with the insulin receptor	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-BIOMEMBRANES			English	Article						Virus-like particles; Model membrane; Cholesterol; Insulin; Insulin receptor; Receptor localization	LIPID RAFTS; PROTEOMIC CHARACTERIZATION; BINDING; BIOSYNTHESIS; RADIOLIGAND; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION; CAVEOLIN	There is emerging evidence of the utility of virus-like particles (VLPs) as a novel model for the study of receptor-ligand interactions in a native plasma membrane environment. VLPs consist of a viral core protein encapsulated by portions of the cell membrane with membrane proteins and receptors expressed in their native conformation. VLPs can be generated in mammalian cells by transfection with the retroviral core protein (gag). In this study, we used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO T10) cells stably overexpressing the insulin receptor (IR) to generate IR bearing VLPs. The diameter and size uniformity of VLPs were estimated by dynamic light scattering and morphological features examined by scanning electron microscopy. The presence of high affinity IR on VLPs was demonstrated by competitive binding assays (K-D: 2.3 +/- 0.4 nM, n = 3), which was similar to that on the parental CHO T10 cells (K-D: 2.1 +/- 0.4 nM, n = 3). We also report that increases or decreases in membrane cholesterol content by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MBCD) or cholesterol pre-loaded methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (cMBCD), respectively, substantially decreased insulin binding (> 30%) to both VLPs and cells, and we speculate this is due to a change in receptor disposition. We suggest that this novel finding of decreases in insulin binding in response to changes in membrane cholesterol content may largely account for the unexplained decreases in insulin signalling events previously reported elsewhere. Finally, we propose VLPs as a viable membrane model for the study of insulin-IR interactions in a native membrane environment.

Although simple FS are generally considered as benign, there is controversy about the outcome of prolonged FS. Here, we have used an animal model of prolonged FS to investigate persistent neurochemical and behavioral alterations in adult rats. Hyperthermic seizures were induced in 12-day-old rats using a warmed air stream from a hair dryer. Neonates exhibited arrest of heat-induced hyperkinesis followed by body flexion and rearing and falling over associated with hindlimb clonus seizures (stage 5 on Racine scale criteria) after hyperthermic induction. After 48 days, the animals were assayed on dark-light box and forced swim tests in order to detect if rats will show signs of anxiety or depression. Finally, animals were sacrificed 56 days after hyperthermia-induced seizures (HIS), and their effects on adenosine A(2A) receptor signaling and 5'-nucleotidase activity were studied in plasma membranes from the cerebral cortex by using radioligand-binding assay and by measuring the activities of adenylate cyclase and 5'-nucleotidase. Results obtained have shown that adult rats submitted to HIS during the neonatal period showed depressive-like behavior. Furthermore, animals exposed to hyperthermic insult showed an increase in A(2A) receptor level which was also accompanied by an increase in A(2A) receptor functionality. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Altered Dopamine Synaptic Markers in Postmortem Brain of Obese Subjects	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						obesity; BMI; dopamine transporter; tyrosine hydroxylase; dopamine receptor; substantia nigra; striatum	BODY-MASS INDEX; D2 RECEPTORS; TRANSPORTER AVAILABILITY; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; FOOD ADDICTION; MECHANISMS; LEPTIN; PLACE	Dopaminergic signaling in the reward pathway in the brain has been shown to play an important role in food intake and the development of obesity. Obese rats release less dopamine (DA) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) after food intake, and amphetamine stimulated striatal DA release is reduced in vivo in obese subjects. These studies suggest that DA hypofunction associated with hedonic dysregulation is involved in the pathophysiology of obesity. To identify brain changes in obesity, quantitative measures of DA synaptic markers were compared in postmortem brain tissues of normal weight and obese subjects over a range of increasing body mass indices (BMI). DA transporter (DAT) numbers in the striatum were compared to the relative expression of DAT, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and D2 dopamine receptors (DRD2) in midbrain DA neurons. Radioligand binding assays of [H-3] WIN35,428 demonstrated that the number of striatal DAT binding sites was inversely correlated with increasing BMI (r = -0.47; p < 0.01). DAT and TH gene expression were significantly decreased in the somatodendritic compartment of obese subjects (p < 0.001), with no significant change in DRD2 compared to normal weight subjects. The reduced density of striatal DAT with corresponding reductions in DAT and TH gene expression in substantia nigra (SN) suggests, that obesity is associated with hypodopaminergic function. A DA reward deficiency syndrome has been suggested to underlie abnormal eating behavior that leads to obesity. Neurobiological changes in presynaptic DA markers demonstrated postmortem in human brain support a link between hedonic DA dysregulation and obesity.

Determinants of this signalling switch identified to date include G alpha(i) blockade, CB1/D-2 receptor co-stimulation, CB1 agonist class and cell background. Hence, we examined the effects of receptor number and different ligands on CB1 receptor signalling. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH CB1 receptors were expressed in HEK cells at different levels, and signalling characterized for cAMP by real-time BRET biosensor -CAMYEL - and for phospho-ERK by AlphaScreen. Homogenate and whole cell radioligand binding assays were performed to characterize AM6544, a novel irreversible CB1 receptor antagonist. KEY RESULTS In HEK cells expressing high levels of CB1 receptors, agonist treatment stimulated cAMP, a response not known to be mediated by receptor number. Delta(9)-THC and BAY59-3074 increased cAMP only in high-expressing cells pretreated with pertussis toxin, and agonists demonstrated more diverse signalling profiles in the stimulatory pathway than the canonical inhibitory pathway. Pharmacological CB1 receptor knockdown and G alpha(i)1 supplementation restored canonical Gai signalling to high-expressing cells. Constitutive signalling in both low- and high-expressing cells was G alpha(i)-mediated. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS CB1 receptor coupling to opposing G proteins is determined by both receptor and G protein expression levels, which underpins a mechanism for non-canonical signalling in a fashion consistent with G alpha(s) signalling. CB1 receptorsmediate opposite consequences in endpoints such as tumour viability depending on expression levels; our results may help to explain such effects at the level of G protein coupling.

First-In-Human Study Demonstrating Tumor-Angiogenesis by PET/CT Imaging with <SUP>68</SUP>Ga-NODAGA-THERANOST, a High-Affinity Peptidomimetic for α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> Integrin Receptor Targeting	CANCER BIOTHERAPY AND RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						alpha(v)beta(3) receptor targeting; positron emission tomography; Ga-68-NODAGA-THERANOST (TM)	RADIOLABELED RGD PEPTIDES; POSITIVE TUMOR; RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS; ANTAGONIST; EXPRESSION; TRACERS; CANCER; AGENT; ACID	Ga-68-NODAGA-THERANOST (TM) is an alpha(v)beta(3) integrin antagonist and the first radiolabeled peptidomimetic to reach clinical development for targeting integrin receptors. In this first-in-human study, the feasibility of integrin receptor peptidomimetic positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) imaging was confirmed in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and breast cancer. Methods: Patients underwent PET/CT imaging with Ga-68 NODAGA-THERANOST. PET images were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively and compared to 2-deoxy-2-(F-18) fluoro-d-glucose (F-18-FDG) findings. Images were obtained 60 minutes postinjection of 300-500 MBq of Ga-68-NODAGA-THERANOST. Results: Ga-68-NODAGA-THERANOST revealed high tumor-to-background ratios (SUVmax=4.8) and uptake at neoangiogenesis sites. Reconstructed fused images distinguished cancers with high malignancy potential and enabled enhanced bone metastasis detection. F-18-FDG-positive lung and lymph node metastases did not show uptake, indicating the absence of neovascularization. Conclusions: Ga-68-NODAGA-THERANOST was found to be safe and effective, exhibiting in this study rapid blood clearance, stability, rapid renal excretion, favorable biodistribution and PK/PD, low irradiation burden (mu Sv/MBq/mu g), and convenient radiolabeling. This radioligand might enable theranostics, that is, a combination of diagnostics followed by the appropriate therapeutics, namely antiangiogenic therapy, image-guided presurgical assessment, treatment response evaluation, prediction of pathologic response, neoadjuvant-peptidomimetic-radiochemotherapy, and personalized medicine strategies. Further clinical trials evaluating Ga-68-NODAGA-THERANOST are warranted.

No evidence for attenuated stress-induced extrastriatal dopamine signaling in psychotic disorder	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; AMPHETAMINE-INDUCED DISPLACEMENT; DAILY-LIFE STRESS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; RECEPTOR-BINDING; NAIVE PATIENTS; D-1 RECEPTORS; HUMAN BRAIN	Stress is an important risk factor in the etiology of psychotic disorder. Preclinical work has shown that stress primarily increases dopamine (DA) transmission in the frontal cortex. Given that DA-mediated hypofrontality is hypothesized to be a cardinal feature of psychotic disorder, stress-related extrastriatal DA release may be altered in psychotic disorder. Here we quantified for the first time stress-induced extrastriatal DA release and the spatial extent of extrastriatal DA release in individuals with non-affective psychotic disorder (NAPD). Twelve healthy volunteers (HV) and 12 matched drug-free NAPD patients underwent a single infusion [F-18] fallypride positron emission tomography scan during which they completed the control and stress condition of the Montreal Imaging Stress Task. HV and NAPD did not differ in stress-induced [F-18] fallypride displacement and the spatial extent of stress-induced [F-18] fallypride displacement in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and temporal cortex (TC). In the whole sample, the spatial extent of stress-induced radioligand displacement in right ventro-mPFC, but not dorso-mPFC or TC, was positively associated with task-induced subjective stress. Psychotic symptoms during the scan or negative, positive and general subscales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale were not associated with stress-induced [F-18] fallypride displacement nor the spatial extent of stress-induced [F-18] fallypride displacement in NAPD. Our results do not offer evidence for altered stress-induced extrastriatal DA signaling in NAPD, nor altered functional relevance. The implications of these findings for the role of the DA system in NAPD and stress processing are discussed.

In radioligand-binding assays with cells expressing human m-opioid receptors (MORs), d-opioid receptors (DORs), or k-opioid receptors (KORs), TRK-130 showed high selectivity for MORs (Ki for MORs, DORs, and KORs 5 0.268, 121, and 8.97 nM, respectively). In a functional assay (cAMP accumulation) with cells expressing each human opioid receptor subtype, TRK-130 showed potent but partial agonistic activity for MORs [EC50 (Emax) forMORs, DORs, and KORs52.39 nM (66.1%), 26.1 nM (71.0%), and 9.51 nM (62.6%), respectively]. In isovolumetric rhythmic bladder contractions (RBCs) in anesthetized guinea pigs, TRK-130 dose-dependently prolonged the shutdown time (the duration of complete cessation of the bladder contractions) (ED30 5 0.0034 mg/ (k)g i. v.) without affecting amplitude of RBCs. Furthermore, TRK-130 ameliorated formalin-induced frequent urination at doses of higher than 0.01 mg/ kg p. o. in guinea pigs under the freely moving condition. Meanwhile, TRK-130 showed only a negligible effect on the gastrointestinal transit at doses of up to 10 mg/ kg s. c. in mice. These results indicate that TRK-130 is a potent and selective human MOR partial agonist without undesirable opioid adverse effects such as constipation and enhances the storage function by suppressing the afferent limb of the micturition reflex pathway, suggesting that TRK-130 would be a new therapeutic agent for OAB.

Mefloquine and psychotomimetics share neurotransmitter receptor and transporter interactions in vitro	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Mefloquine; Chloroquine; Quinine; Malaria; LSD; Psychotomimetic; Neurotransmitter; Transporter; Serotonin receptor; Dopamine receptor	ANTIMALARIAL-DRUGS; 5-HT2C RECEPTORS; DOUBLE-BLIND; CELL-TYPE; AGONIST; HALLUCINOGENS; DOPAMINE; MALARIA; LSD; PHARMACOKINETICS	Mefloquine is used for the prevention and treatment of chloroquine-resistant malaria, but its use is associated with nightmares, hallucinations, and exacerbation of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. We hypothesized that potential mechanisms of action for the adverse psychotropic effects of mefloquine resemble those of other known psychotomimetics. Using in vitro radioligand binding and functional assays, we examined the interaction of (+)- and (-)-mefloquine enantiomers, the non-psychotomimetic anti-malarial agent, chloroquine, and several hallucinogens and psychostimulants with recombinant human neurotransmitter receptors and transporters. Hallucinogens and mefloquine bound stereoselectively and with relatively high affinity (K (i) = 0.71-341 nM) to serotonin (5-HT) (2A) but not 5-HT1A or 5-HT2C receptors. Mefloquine but not chloroquine was a partial 5-HT2A agonist and a full 5-HT2C agonist, stimulating inositol phosphate accumulation, with similar potency and efficacy as the hallucinogen dimethyltryptamine (DMT). 5-HT receptor antagonists blocked mefloquine's effects. Mefloquine had low or no affinity for dopamine D-1, D-2, D-3, and D-4.4 receptors, or dopamine and norepinephrine transporters. However, mefloquine was a very low potency antagonist at the D-3 receptor and mefloquine but not chloroquine or hallucinogens blocked [H-3]5-HT uptake by the 5-HT transporter. Mefloquine, but not chloroquine, shares an in vitro receptor interaction profile with some hallucinogens and this neurochemistry may be relevant to the adverse neuropsychiatric effects associated with mefloquine use by a small percentage of patients. Additionally, evaluating interactions with this panel of receptors and transporters may be useful for characterizing effects of other psychotropic drugs and for avoiding psychotomimetic effects for new pharmacotherapies, including antimalarial quinolines.

Typically, 4.3-5.2GBq of [18F] DPA-C5yne, ready-to-use, chemically and radiochemically pure (> 95%), was obtained with specific radioactivities ranging from 55 to 110GBq/mu mol within 50-60 min, starting from a 30GBq [F-18] fluoride batch (14-17%). LogP and LogD of [F-18] DPA-C5yne were measured using the shake-flask method and values of 2.39 and 2.51 were found, respectively. Autoradiography studies performed on slices of ((R, S)-alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolopropionique (AMPA)-lesioned rat brains showed a high target-to-background ratio (1.9 +/- 0.3). Selectivity and specificity of the binding for the translocator protein was demonstrated using DPA-C5yne (unlabelled), PK11195 and Flumazenil (central benzodiazepine receptor ligand) as competitors. Furthermore, DPA-C5yne proved to be stable in plasma at 37 C for at least 90min.

Gestational hypertension in atrial natriuretic peptide knockout mice and the developmental origins of salt-sensitivity and cardiac hypertrophy	REGULATORY PEPTIDES			English	Article						Natriuretic peptides; Salt-sensitivity; Developmental origins; Hypertension; Cardiac hypertrophy	LEFT-VENTRICULAR MASS; RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM; BLOOD-PRESSURE; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK; ALTERED EXPRESSION; ESTROGEN PROTECTS; B-TYPE; HEART; RECEPTORS; CHILDREN	Objective: To determine the effect of gestational hypertension on the developmental origins of blood pressure (BP), altered kidney gene expression, salt-sensitivity and cardiac hypertrophy (CH) in adult offspring. Methods: Female mice lacking atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP-/-) were used as a model of gestational hypertension. Heterozygous ANP+/- offspring was bred from crossing either ANP+/+ females with ANP-/- males yielding ANP+/-(WT) offspring, or from ANP-/- females with ANP+/+ males yielding ANP+/-(KO) offspring. Maternal BP during pregnancy was measured using radiotelemetry. At 14 weeks of age, offspring BP, gene and protein expression were measured in the kidney with real-time quantitative PCR, receptor binding assay and ELISA. Results: ANP+/-(KO) offspring exhibited normal BP at 14 weeks of age, but displayed significant CH (P < 0.001) as compared to ANP+/-(WT) offspring. ANP+/-(KO) offspring exhibited significantly increased gene expression of natriuretic peptide receptor A (NPR-A) (P < 0.001) and radioligand binding studies demonstrated significantly reduced NPR-C binding (P = 0.01) in the kidney. Treatment with high salt diet increased BP (P < 0.01) and caused LV hypertrophy (P < 0.001) and interstitial myocardial fibrosis only in ANP+/-(WT) and not ANP+/-(KO) offspring, suggesting gestational hypertension programs the offspring to show resistance to salt-induced hypertension and LV remodeling. Our data demonstrate that altered maternal environments can determine the salt-sensitive phenotype of offspring. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Armstrong, David W. J.; Tse, M.

Up-regulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in menthol cigarette smokers	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Age; nicotine dependence; nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; positron emission tomography; tobacco	SMOKING-CESSATION; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; TOBACCO SMOKING; BINDING; BRAIN; OCCUPANCY; PET; QUANTIFICATION; ABSTINENCE; DEPENDENCE	One-third of smokers primarily use menthol cigarettes and usage of these cigarettes leads to elevated serum nicotine levels and more difficulty quitting in standard treatment programmes. Previous brain imaging studies demonstrate that smoking (without regard to cigarette type) leads to up-regulation of beta*(2)-containing nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We sought to determine if menthol cigarette usage results in greater nAChR up-regulation than non-menthol cigarette usage. Altogether, 114 participants (22 menthol cigarette smokers, 41 non-menthol cigarette smokers and 51 non-smokers) underwent positron emission tomography scanning using the alpha(4)beta*(2) nAChR radioligand 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 (2-FA). In comparing menthol to non-menthol cigarette smokers, an overall test of 2-FA total volume of distribution values revealed a significant between-group difference, resulting from menthol smokers having 9-28% higher alpha(4)beta*(2) nAChR densities than non-menthol smokers across regions. In comparing the entire group of smokers to non-smokers, an overall test revealed a significant between-group difference, resulting from smokers having higher alpha(4)beta*(2) nAChR levels in all regions studied (36-42%) other than thalamus (3%). Study results demonstrate that menthol smokers have greater up-regulation of nAChRs than non-menthol smokers. This difference is presumably related to higher nicotine exposure in menthol smokers, although other mechanisms for menthol influencing receptor density are possible. These results provide additional information about the severity of menthol cigarette use and may help explain why these smokers have more trouble quitting in standard treatment programmes.

Cannabinoid Receptor Antagonist-Induced Striated Muscle Toxicity and Ethylmalonic-Adipic Aciduria in Beagle Dogs	TOXICOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						metabonomics; biomarkers; muscle toxicity; pharmaceuticals; cannabinoid receptor; electron transfer flavoprotein	CHAIN ACYL-COENZYME; DEHYDROGENASE-DEFICIENCY; A DEHYDROGENASE; FIBER TYPES; OBESITY	Ibipinabant (IBI), a potent cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) antagonist, previously in development for the treatment of obesity, causes skeletal and cardiac myopathy in beagle dogs. This toxicity was characterized by increases in muscle-derived enzyme activity in serum and microscopic striated muscle degeneration and accumulation of lipid droplets in myofibers. Additional changes in serum chemistry included decreases in glucose and increases in non-esterified fatty acids and cholesterol, and metabolic acidosis, consistent with disturbances in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. No evidence of CB1R expression was detected in dog striated muscle as assessed by polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and competitive radioligand binding. Investigative studies utilized metabonomic technology and demonstrated changes in several intermediates and metabolites of fatty acid metabolism including plasma acylcarnitines and urinary ethylmalonate, methylsuccinate, adipate, suberate, hexanoylglycine, sarcosine, dimethylglycine, isovalerylglycine, and 2-hydroxyglutarate. These results indicated that the toxic effect of IBI on striated muscle in beagle dogs is consistent with an inhibition of the mitochondrial flavin-containing enzymes including dimethyl glycine, sarcosine, isovaleryl-CoA, 2-hydroxyglutarate, and multiple acyl-CoA (short, medium, long, and very long chain) dehydrogenases. All of these enzymes converge at the level of electron transfer flavoprotein (ETF) and ETF oxidoreductase. Urinary ethylmalonate was shown to be a biomarker of IBI-induced striated muscle toxicity in dogs and could provide the ability to monitor potential IBI-induced toxic myopathy in humans. We propose that IBI-induced toxic myopathy in beagle dogs is not caused by direct antagonism of CB1R and could represent a model of ethylmalonic-adipic aciduria in humans.

To examine whether there is a CnB receptor on peritoneal macrophages, we performed the radioligand binding assay of receptors. The receptor saturation binding curve demonstrated high-affinity and specific binding; the maximum binding was 1090 fmol/10(5) cells, and the K-d was 70.59 pM. Then, we used a CnB affinity resin to trap potential receptors from highly purified peritoneal macrophage membranes. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that the binding protein was mouse integrin alpha M. We next performed a competition binding experiment to confirm the binding of CnB to integrin alpha M. This showed that FITC-CnB bound specifically to peritoneal macrophages and that binding was blocked by the addition of integrin aM Ab. We observed that CnB could induce TRAIL gene expression in peritoneal macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Integrin alpha M Ab blocking, RNA interference, and ligand competition experiments demonstrated that CnB-induced TRAIL expression is dependent on integrin alpha M. Furthermore, the tumoricidal activity of CnB-activated peritoneal macrophages is partially dependent on TRAIL. In addition, CnB treatment significantly prolongs the survival of mice bearing H22 ascites tumors, which has a positive correlation with the induction level of TRAIL. These results reveal a novel function of the CnB in innate immunity and cancer surveillance. They also point to a new signaling pathway leading to induction of TRAIL and suggest a possible application of CnB in cancer therapy. The Journal of Immunology, 2012, 188: 238-247.

In a search for such compounds, TH-030418 [7 alpha-[(R)-1-hydroxy-1-methyl-3-(thien-3-yl)-propyl]-6,14-endo-ethanotetrahydrooripavine] was synthesized. Here, we evaluated the pharmacological activities of TH-030418, in comparison with morphine, the prototype opioid analgesic. In radioligand binding assays, TH-030418 bound potently and nonselectively to mu-, delta-, kappa-, and ORL1 (opioid receptor-like 1) receptors stably expressed in CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cells with K (i) values of 0.56, 0.73, 0.60, and 1.55 nM, respectively. When administered subcutaneously, TH-030418 was much more potent than morphine in analgesia, with the ED(50) values of 1.37 mu g/kg and 1.70 mu g/kg in hot plate and acetic acid writhing tests, respectively. The opioid antagonist naloxone blocked the antinociceptive effect of TH-030418, indicating that the action of TH-030418 was mediated by opioid receptors. The antinociceptive effect of s.c. TH-030418 in hot plate test lasted for more than 12 h, which is much longer than those of morphine (2.5 h) and dihydroetorphine (1.5 h). In addition, naloxone did not precipitate withdrawal syndrome in the mice treated with TH-030418 previously. Most importantly, TH-030418 did not induce conditioned place preference in mice after chronic treatment. These results indicate that TH-030418 is a potent long-acting opioid analgesic with low dependence liability and may be of some value in the development of new analgesics.

Positron emission tomography (PET) determination of 5-HT1B receptor occupancy with drug candidates targeting this receptor in non-human primate and human subjects may facilitate translation of research from animal models and guide dose selection for clinical studies. AZD3783 is a recently developed, orally bioavailable 5-HT1B receptor antagonist with potential antidepressant properties. To determine the relationship between plasma concentration of AZD3783 and occupancy at primate brain 5-HT1B receptors using PET and the radioligand [C-11]AZ10419369. PET studies with [C-11]AZ10419369 were performed in three non-human primates at baseline and after intravenous injection of AZD3783. Subsequently, PET measurements were undertaken in six human subjects at baseline and after administration of different single oral doses of AZD3783 (1-40 mg). After administration in non-human primates and human subjects, AZD3783 reduced regional [C-11]AZ10419369 binding in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. The AZD3783 plasma concentration required for 50% receptor occupancy (K (i,plasma)) for monkeys was 25 and 27 nmol/L in occipital cortex and striatum, respectively. Corresponding estimates for human occipital cortex and ventral striatum were 24 and 18 nmol/L, respectively. The potential antidepressant AZD3783 binds in a saturable manner to brain 5-HT1B receptors with a similar in vivo affinity for human and monkey receptors. [C-11]AZ10419369 can be successfully used to determine occupancy at brain 5-HT1B receptors in vivo and constitutes a useful tool for dose selection in clinical studies with 5-HT1B receptor compounds.

It is, however, still an open question whether [F-18]CPFPX is displaceable by endogenous adenosine, which would allow to detect activity-dependent adenosine release in vivo. We used the tritiated analog of [F-18]CPFPX, [H-3]CPFPX, to quantify A(1) adenosine receptors (A(1)AR) in grey matter tissue homogenates of four human brains and A(1)AR transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively. Saturation binding experiments in the presence of a stable GTP analog revealed a dissociation constant (K-D) of 2.4 +/- 0.5 nM. The unselective endogenous A(1)AR agonist adenosine and the antagonist caffeine displaced specific [H-3]CPFPX binding completely at high doses. Concentrations sufficient to inhibit 50% of binding (IC50) were 6.9 +/- 2.7 mu M for adenosine and 148 +/- 15.4 mu M for caffeine. Respective inhibition constants (K-i) were 2.8 +/- 0.9 mu M and 61.4 +/- 11.2 mu M. The present report supports the possibility of studying acute effects of adenosine and caffeine in vivo with [F-18]CPFPX and PET. Pathophysiological conditions like hypoxia which increase endogenous adenosine concentrations several folds might interfere with in vivo [F-18]CPFPX binding. Caffeine intake previous to the investigation should be considered as a confounding factor regarding the determination of receptor densities with [F-18]CPFPX and PET. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Nociceptin Inhibits Uterine Contractions in Term-Pregnant Rats by Signaling Through Multiple Pathways	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						cyclic adenosine monophosphate; neuropeptides; pregnancy; signal transduction; uterus	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; IN-VITRO; PEPTIDE IMMUNOREACTIVITY; ORPHANIN FQ/NOCICEPTIN; GENE-EXPRESSION; KNOCKOUT MICE; ORL1 RECEPTOR; FQ RECEPTOR; BINDING; SYSTEM	The actions of the endogenous peptide nociceptin (PNOC; previously abbreviated as N/OFQ) on the myometrium have not been investigated previously. Our aim was to study the presence and functional role of PNOC in the modulation of uterine contractility in pregnant rats at term. The presence of PNOC and its receptors (OPRL1; previously called NOP) in the uterus were detected by radioimmunoassay and radioligand-binding experiments. The PNOC-stimulated G protein activation was assessed by a [S-35] GTPgammaS-binding technique. The effects of PNOC in uterine rings precontracted with KCl or oxytocin were also tested in vitro. Uterine levels of cAMP were measured by enzyme immunoassay. The K+ channel blockers tetraethylammonium and paxilline were used to study the role of K+ channels in mediating the uterine effects of PNOC. Both PNOC and OPRL1 were present in the uterus. PNOC revealed a maximum contraction inhibition of approximately 30%, which was increased to 40% by naloxone. Naloxone and pertussis toxin significantly attenuated the G protein-stimulating effect of PNOC. The uterine cAMP levels were elevated by PNOC and naloxone and after preincubation with pertussis toxin. Tetraethylammonium and paxilline reduced the contraction-inhibiting effect of PNOC and naloxone to approximately 10% and 15%, respectively. We presume that PNOC plays a role in regulating uterine contractility at term. Its effect is mediated partly by stimulatory heterotrimeric G (G(s)) proteins coupled to OPRL1 receptors and elevated cAMP levels, and also by Ca2+-dependent K+ channels. Our results demonstrate a novel action and signaling pathway for PNOC that might be a potential drug target.	[Klukovits, A.; Deak, B.

The δ<sub>1</sub> Opioid Receptor Is a Heterodimer That Opposes the Actions of the δ<sub>2</sub> Receptor on Alcohol Intake	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Alcoholism; delta opioid receptor; ethanol; g-protein coupled receptor; heterodimerization; subtypes	MOUSE SPINAL-CORD; ETHANOL-CONSUMPTION; KNOCKOUT MICE; C57BL/6 MICE; MEDIATED ANTINOCICEPTION; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MORPHINE TREATMENT; MU; ANTAGONIST; KAPPA	Background: Opioid receptors are clinically important targets for both pain and alcohol abuse. Three opioid receptors have been cloned: mu, delta, and kappa, all of which effect alcohol consumption in animal models. Naltrexone is a nonselective opioid antagonist used for alcoholism, the clinical utility of which is limited by poor efficacy and adverse side effects. Here, we demonstrate that the therapeutic limitations of naltrexone may reflect its poor selectivity. Despite decades of research, several mysteries surround the pharmacology of these receptors. For example, two pharmacologically defined subtypes of delta receptors exist in vivo. Methods: Effects of delta subtype-selective ligands (naltrindole, naltriben, tan-67, 7-benzylidene naltrexone) were measured on ethanol consumption in C57BL/6 wildtype and opioid receptor knockout mice using a limited access two-bottle choice paradigm. Affinity and efficacy of naltriben, 7-benzylidenenaltrexone and tan-67 was measured in vitro using radioligand binding and Ca2+-mobilizationa assays. Results: We show that the subtypes of the 8 receptor, 8, and 6, have opposing effects on ethanol consumption. We find that these effects are synergistic; thereby suggesting that 8, and 82 receptors are distinct molecular targets. Indeed, we provide both in vitro as well as in vivo evidence that the delta(1) subtype is a mu-delta heterodimer and that the 62 subtype is most likely a 8 homomer. Conclusions: Together these data provide insight into the limited actions of the clinically important drug naltrexone and identify a novel target with improved specificity and efficacy for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of alcoholism.

Pharmacological characterisation of the avian dopamine receptors has had little attention. In this paper we characterise the two classes of dopamine receptors in Japanese quail brain by radioligand binding techniques using [H-3]SCH 23390 (D-1) and [H-3]spiperone (D-2). Association, dissociation and saturation analyses showed that the binding of both radioligands is time- and concentration-dependent, saturable and reversible. Apparent dissociation constants determined for [H-3]SCH 23390 and [H-3]spiperone from concentration isotherms were 1.07 and 0.302 nM and the maximum binding capacities were 89.3 and 389.3 fmol per mg of protein, respectively. Using competitive binding studies with a spectrum of dopamine and other neurotransmitter receptor agonists/antagonists, the [H-3]SCH 23390 and [H-3]spiperone binding sites were characterised pharmacologically. Pharmacological profiles of quail dopamine receptors showed a high degree of pharmacological homology with other vertebrate dopamine receptors. The data presented extend the knowledge of kinetics and pharmacology of D-1- and D-2-like dopamine receptors in birds, provide data for avian psychopharmacological and comparative studies and represent an important complement to studies using cell expression systems.

Colchicine: A Novel Positive Allosteric Modulator of the Human 5-Hydroxytryptamine<sub>3A</sub> Receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							XENOPUS-LAEVIS OOCYTES; 5-HT3 RECEPTOR; BINDING-SITE; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; LIGAND-BINDING; NEUROBLASTOMA-CELLS; GABA(A) RECEPTORS; POTENTIATION; GLYCINE; DOMAIN	The actions of colchicine were examined with the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique and radioligand binding assays in mouse and human 5-hydroxytryptamine(3A) receptors (5-HT(3A)Rs) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Colchicine inhibited 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-evoked currents in oocytes expressing mouse 5-HT(3A)Rs, with an IC50 of 59.5 +/- 3 mu M. In contrast to the mouse receptor, coapplication of colchicine with 5-HT (< 1 mu M) strongly enhanced 5-HT-evoked currents in oocytes expressing human 5-HT(3A)Rs. Colchicine applied alone did not induce a detectable current. In the presence of 0.5 mu M 5-HT, the potentiation was concentration-dependent and reached the maximum (similar to 100%) when 750 mu M colchicine was applied. However, colchicine-dependent inhibition can be observed at 5-HT concentrations > 1 mu M. In oocyte membranes expressing mouse or human receptors, binding studies with colchicine (25 nM-1 mM) revealed no displacement of 1-methyl-N-((1R,3r,5S)-9-methyl-9 azabicyclo [3.3.1]nonan-3yl)-1H-indazole-3 carboxamide ([H-3]BRL-43694), suggesting that actions of colchicine do not occur at the ligand binding domain. Functional effects of colchicine on both receptors occurred in the absence of preincubation and after cold temperature incubation, suggesting that the microtubule-depolymerizing effects of colchicine play no role in modulation of receptor function. Studies with interspecies chimeric receptors demonstrated that the distal one third of the N terminus is responsible for the bidirectional modulation by colchicine. Collectively, these results suggest that colchicine modulates receptor function through loops C and/or F through a gating mechanism.	[de Oliveira-Pierce, A. N.; Zhang, R.; Machu, T.

We therefore investigated the binding of a tracer concentration of H-3-FDDNP to brain sections containing AD hallmark pathologies. Semi-adjacent sections were labelled with H-3-PIB (Pittsburgh compound-B, 2-[4'-(methylamino)phenyl]-6-hydroxybenzothiazole) and C-14-SB13 (4-N-methylamino-4'-hydroxystilbene) for comparison. Neocortical sections containing widespread senile plaques and cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy, produced a sparse and weak labelling following incubation with H-3-FDDNP. Furthermore, in sections containing NFTs, there was no overt labelling of the pathology by H-3-FDDNP. In contrast, sections labelled with H-3-PIB displayed extensive labelling of diffuse plaques, classical plaques, cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy and NFTs. C-14-SB13 produced a broadly similar binding pattern to PIB. Radioligand binding assays employing in vitro generated amyloid-beta peptide fibrils demonstrated a similar to 10-fold reduced affinity for H-3-FDDNP (85.0 +/- 2.0 nM) compared with H-3-PIB (8.5 +/- 1.3 nM). These data provide an alternative mechanistic explanation for the observed low cortical uptake of F-18-FDDNP in AD; in that the ligand is only weakly retained by the hallmark neuropathology because of its low affinity for amyloid structures.

Identification of a Putative Intracellular Allosteric Antagonist Binding-Site in the CXC Chemokine Receptors 1 and 2	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; SMALL-MOLECULE ANTAGONISTS; INTERLEUKIN-8 RECEPTOR; NONPEPTIDE ANTAGONIST; NEUTROPHIL MIGRATION; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; REPERFUSION INJURY; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; AMINO-TERMINUS	The chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) implicated in mediating cellular functions associated with the inflammatory response. Potent CXCR2 receptor antagonists have been discovered, some of which have recently entered clinical development. The aim of this study was to identify key amino acid residue differences between CXCR1 and CXCR2 that influence the relative antagonism by two compounds that have markedly different chemical structures. By investigating the effects of domain switching and point mutations, we found that the second extracellular loop, which contained significant amino acid sequence diversity, was not important for compound antagonism. We were surprised to find that switching the intracellular C-terminal 60 amino acid domains of CXCR1 and CXCR2 caused an apparent reversal of antagonism at these two receptors. Further investigation showed that a single amino acid residue, lysine 320 in CXCR2 and asparagine 311 in CXCR1, plays a predominant role in describing the relative antagonism of the two compounds. Homology modeling studies based on the structure of bovine rhodopsin indicated a potential intracellular antagonist binding pocket involving lysine 320. We conclude that residue 320 in CXCR2 forms part of a potential allosteric binding pocket on the intracellular side of the receptor, a site that is distal to the orthosteric site commonly assumed to be the location of antagonist binding to GPCRs. The existence of a common intracellular allosteric binding site at GPCRs related to CXCR2 may be of value in the design of novel antagonists for therapeutic intervention.

These discrepant findings led us to determine if we could obtain similar results using samples from the same tissue block. Our studies used single-point saturation analyses to estimate the total number of [H-3]ketanserin binding sites in tissue sections, crude homogenate, membrane-enriched and cytosol-enriched tissue samples from Brodmann's area 9. There were significant decreases in the levels of [H-3]ketanserin binding using tissue sections (mean +/- SD: 38 +/- 16 vs. 56 +/- 16 fmol/mg ETE; p = 0.008) and crude tissue homogenates (131 +/- 53 vs. 168 +/- 38 fmol/mg protein; p < 0.05) from subjects with schizophrenia compared to that in controls. By contrast, there was no significant difference in radioligand binding to the membrane-enriched (155 +/- 95 vs. 145 +/- 48 fmol/mg protein, p = 0.72) or cytosol-enriched (8.6 +/- 14 vs. 7.5 +/- 10 mol/mg protein; p = 0.85) tissue fraction. significantly, adding 10(-5) M risperidone or chlorpromazine, as surrogates for residual antipsychotic drugs in the CNS, to crude homogenate from control subjects did not alter [H-3]ketanserin binding. Our data therefore is consistent with the hypothesis that apparent decreases in serotonin(2A) receptors in schizophrenia are due to altered levels of a regulatory factor(s) that modulates the binding of ligands to the serotonin(2A) receptor and that separating the membrane and cytosol removes this regulatory control.

The (S)-stereoisomer, 1-((S)-5-tert-butyl-indan-1-yl)-3- isoquinolin-5-yl-urea (A-778316), is 6.8-fold less potent (pIC(50)= 7.47 +/- 0.07). A-778317 also potently blocks capsaicin and acid activation of native rat TRPV1 receptors in dorsal root ganglion neurons. A-778317 was tritiated ([H-3] A-778317; 29.3 Ci/mmol) and used to study recombinant human TRPV1 (hTRPV1) receptors expressed in Chinese ovary cells (CHO) cells. [H-3] A-778317 labeled a single class of binding sites in hTRPV1-expressing CHO cell membranes with high affinity (K-D=3.4 nM; B-max=4.0 pmol/mg protein). Specific binding of 2 nM [H-3] A-778317 to hTRPV1-expressing CHO cell membranes was reversible. The rank-order potency of TRPV1 receptor antagonists to inhibit binding of 2 nM [H-3] A-778317 correlated well with their functional potencies in blocking TRPV1 receptor activation. The present data demonstrate that A-778317 blocks polymodal activation of the TRPV1 receptor by binding to a single high-affinity binding site and that [H-3] A-778317 possesses favorable binding properties to facilitate further studies of hTRPV1 receptor pharmacology.

Autoradiographic studies in rhesus monkey brain showed that [F-18]MK-9470 binding is aligned with the reported distribution of CB1 receptors with high specific binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, cauclate/putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys showed high brain uptake and a distribution pattern generally consistent with that seen in the autoradiographic studies. Uptake was blocked by pretreatment with a potent CB1 inverse agonist, MK-0364. The ratio of total to nonspecific binding in putamen was 4-5:1, indicative of a strong specific signal that was confirmed to be reversible via displacement studies with MK-0364. Baseline PET imaging studies in human research subject demonstrated behavior of [F-18]MK-9470 very similar to that seen in monkeys, with very good test-retest variability (7%). Proof of concept studies in healthy young male human subjects showed that MK-0364, given orally, produced a dose-related reduction in [F-18]MK-9470 binding reflecting CB1R receptor occupancy by the drug. Thus, [F-18]MK-9470 has the potential to be a valuable, noninvasive research tool for the in vivo study of CB1R biology and pharmacology in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders in humans. In addition, it allows demonstration of target engagement and noninvasive close-occupancy studies to aid in dose selection for clinical trials of CB1R inverse agonists.

Methods: In vitro receptor autoradiography was performed in cancers expressing the various bombesin receptor subtypes. The novel radioligand Lu-177-AMBA was used and compared with established bombesin radioligands such as I-125-Tyr(4)-bombesin and I-125-[D-Tyr(6), beta-Ala(11), Phe(13), Nle(14)]-bombesin( 6 - 14). In vitro incidence of detection of each of the three bombesin receptor subtypes was evaluated in each tumour. Results: Lu-177-AMBA identified all GRP-R-expressing tumours, such as prostatic, mammary and renal cell carcinomas as well as gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Lu-177-AMBA also identified all NMB-expressing tumours, but did not detect BRS-3-expressing tumours or BRS-3-expressing pancreatic islets. GRP-R-expressing peritumoural vessels were heavily labelled with Lu-177-AMBA. In contrast to the strongly GRP-R-positive mouse pancreas, the human pancreas was not labelled with Lu-177-AMBA unless chronic pancreatitis was diagnosed. In general, the sensitivity was slightly better with Lu-177-AMBA than with the conventional bombesin radioligands. Conclusion: The present in vitro study suggests that Lu-177-AMBA may be a very useful in vivo targeting agent for GRP-R-expressing tumours, NMB-R-expressing tumours and GRP-R-expressing neoangiogenic vessels.

It has been demonstrated that this activity is mediated through the Toll-like receptor (TLR)7- and TLR8-signaling cascade resulting in the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and, consecutively, induction of a tumor-directed cellular immune response. In addition, imiquimod exerts a direct proapoptotic activity in tumor cells. We demonstrate here that imiquimod induces activation of the transcription factor NF-kappa B and the downstream production of proinflammatory cytokines in the absence of TLR7 and TLR8. In Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human adenosine receptor subtypes, we then show in radioligand-binding competition experiments that imiquimod binds to adenosine receptors at concentrations relevant in clinical settings, with highest affinities to the A(1) and A(2A) subtypes. The effect on the receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase was also studied, and these experiments revealed that imiquimod acts as an adenosine receptor antagonist. In addition, imiquimod had an inhibitory effect on adenylyl cyclase activity downstream from the receptor. Finally, using transformed human keratinocytes, we provide experimental evidence that imiquimod and A2A adenosine receptor-specific compounds similarly induce proinflammatory cytokines in the absence of immune cells. Thus, imiquimod appears to suppress an important feedback mechanism of inflammation by antagonism of adenosine receptor-dependent increase of cAMP and a concomitant receptor-independent inhibition of cAMP production. These novel mechanisms presumably act synergistic with the positive induction of proinflammatory cytokines and can, at least in part, explain the profound inflammation observed in some patients in vivo.

Analysis of human, mouse, and rat plasma extracts by HPLC identified four identical radioactive metabolites in each species. The low mass of radioligand administered to humans ( 0.5 - 5 nmol) prevented direct identification of metabolites. However, incubating liver microsomes with CPFPX and analysis by means of liquid chromatography- mass spectrometry ( LC- MS) identified seven compounds, four having the same retention times as the metabolites in human plasma. Analysis of microsomal metabolites by LC- MS identified five [ M + H] (+) ions of m/ z equivalent to hydroxy derivatives, 339, one of m/ z equivalent to an oxo derivative, m/ z 337, and one of m/ z equivalent to a difunctionalized oxo- desaturation species, m/ z 335, which is prominent in rat and mouse plasma and is the main metabolite in human plasma. An [ M + H] (+) ion corresponding to a N- dealkylated derivative was not detected. Thus, like the natural methylxanthines, CPFPX seems to undergo oxidation by liver microsomes but, unlike those methylxanthines, dealkylation did not occur. LC- MS experiments with " in source" fragmentation identified the cyclopentyl moiety to be the most functionalized part of the molecule by liver microsomes and in vivo oxidations. Except for two metabolites, hydroxylated at the N1 propyl chain, all oxidative modifications found took place at the cyclopentyl ring.

Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of [O-methyl-C-11]2-{4-[4-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (10), a potential high affinity (K-i = 1.36 nM) 5-HT1A agonist PET tracer is described. Piperazine 10 is a 5-HT1A agonist with an EC50 comparable to serotonin, based on cAMP formation and GTP(gamma)S binding assays. Radiosynthesis of [C-11]10 has been achieved by reacting 2-{4-[4-(7-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazitle-3,5-dione (9) and [C-11]CH3OTf in 25 +/- 5% (n = 15) yield at the end of synthesis (EOS). The chemical and radiochemical purities of [C-11]10 were > 99% with a specific activity 1500 +/- 300 Ci/mmol (n = 15). PET studies in anesthetized baboon demonstrate [C-11]10 specific binding, in brain regions rich in 5-HTIA receptors. Binding of [C-11]10 was blocked by WAY 100635 and 8-OH-DPAT. The regional brain volumes of distribution (V-T) of [C-11]10 in baboon correlate with [C-11]WAY100635 V-T in baboons. These data provide evidence that [C-11]10 is the first promising agonist PET tracer for the 5-HTIA receptors.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the EGFR content in breast carcinomas, its possible relationship with different clinical-pathological parameters, and its potential prognostic significance and predictive value. EGFR levels were examined by radioligand binding assays in 846 patients with invasive breast cancer. The median follow-up period was 50 months. There was a wide variability of EGFR levels among the studied tumors (0.01-403 fmol/mg protein). Statistical analysis showed that EGFR levels were significantly higher in younger patients (p=0.0001). EGFR were also notably higher in ER-negative or PgR-negative tumors than in ER-positive (p=0.0001) or PgR-positive tumors (p=0.001). In addition, the presence of high intratumoral EGFR levels (cut-off: 6 fmol/mg protein) was associated with both shorter relapse-free survival (p=0.04) and overall survival (p=0.01) in the group of patients as a whole, as well as with overall survival in the subgroup of patients without any type of systemic adjuvant treatment (p=0.02). However, EGFR levels did not achieve significance as independent prognostic factor in the multivariate analysis. There is a wide variability of intratumoral EGFR levels in breast carcinomas, and these protein levels correlated positively with a poor prognosis in the t univariate analysis. However, further studies are necessary in order to assess the possible clinical value of EGFR in combination with other essential components of the EGFR family network.

The expression of total estrogen receptor beta (ER beta) protein and of its COOH-terminally spliced variant ER beta cx (or ER beta 2) was compared in 43 invasive breast cancers and in 39 adjacent normal mammary glands and 26 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Thirty-six breast cancers were ER positive by radioligand binding assay. The analysis was done by immunohistochemistry on adjacent sections of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumors using polyclonal anti-ER beta 503 IgYand sheep polyclonal ER beta cx antibodies that were previously validated. Nuclear staining was quantified using a computerized image analyzer in selected areas of normal and cancer epithelial cells. Total ER beta expression was high in normal glands, decreased in DCIS (P = 0.0004), and increased from DCIS to invasive tumors (P = 0.029). In contrast, the ER beta cx expression was low in normal glands, increased significantly in DCIS (P = 0.0014), and continued to increase in invasive carcinomas (P = 0.0027) in both ER alpha-positive and ER alpha-negative tumors. This is the first study showing a significant increase of the ER beta cx variant protein in DCIS and invasive breast cancer compared with adjacent normal glands. This contrasts with the decrease of the total ER beta level in the same patients and indicates different mechanisms to explain these variations during mammary carcinogenesis. It also suggests a role of the ER beta cx variant in carcinogenesis opposite to the protective effect of the wild-type ER beta 1.

Intermediate alkyl chain length and methoxyl group position on the tetralin nucleus were varied. A few naphthalene analogues were also prepared. High affinities were found in sigma(2) receptor binding for almost all compounds, some of which displayed K-i values in subnanomolar range, but low sigma(2)/sigma(1) selectivities were found. The highest sigma(2) affinities were displayed by compounds with an intermediate alkyl chain of three (32 and 43) or five methylenes (39 and 46). Quite high sigma(1) receptor affinity was found for compounds with a four-methylene chain; 36 (K-i = 0.036 nM) and 45 (K-i = 0.22 nM) displaying good sigma(1)/sigma(2) selectivity (406- and 139-fold, respectively). Moreover, homologues of compound 33 displayed also satisfactory selectivities over dopamine D-2-like, serotonin 5-HT3, and adrenergic a, receptors. These compounds and a few others were tested in the inhibition of the electrically evoked contractions in guinea pig bladder and were demonstrated to be full sigma(2) agonists. The activity values correlated well to the affinity scale (EC50 in muM range). 33 and related compounds are proposed as a class of potential antineoplastic and PET diagnosis agents.

In the present paper, the scope of the nucleophilic aromatic fluorinations at the meta- and para-position of the pyridine ring with no-carrier-added [F-18]fluoride ion as its activated K[F-18]F-K-222 complex has been evaluated and compared to the nucleophilic aromatic fluorinations at the ortho-position in this pyridine series. The syntheses of 3- and 4-[F-18]fluoropyridines were chosen as model reactions and compared to the radiosynthesis of 2-[F-18]fluoropyridine. The parameters studied include the influence of the position of the leaving group at the pyridine ring, as well as the quantity of the precursor used, the type of activation (conventional heating, microwave irradiation), the solvent, the temperature and the reaction time. Using the corresponding nitro precursor, high yields were obtained at the 2-position (94% yield) using microwaves (100 W) for 2 min in DMSO. Good yields (up to 72%) were observed at the 4-position using the same conditions while practically no reaction was observed at the 3-position. About 60% yield was also obtained at both the 2- and 4-position using the corresponding nitro precursor at 145degreesC for 10 min in DMSO. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

The objective of this work was to evaluate the EGFR and c-erbB-2 levels in non-resectable gastric carcinomas, their possible relationship with a variety of clinicopathological tumor parameters, and their prognostic significance. Methods: This was a prospective analysis of 65 patients with unresectable gastric carcinomas (UICC R1 or R2), who underwent palliative surgery and were followed up for a median period of 13 months. Membranous EGFR levels were examined by radioligand binding assays and cytosolic c-erbB-2 levels by means of an immunoenzymatic assay. Results: There was a wide variability in EGFR (80.3-2910 fmol/mg of protein) and c-erbB-2 (0.4-10071 NHU/mg of protein) levels in neoplastic tissues from patients with unresectable gastric carcinomas. Median c-erbB2 was significantly higher in tumors of the intestinal type than in tumors of the diffuse type (p=0.035) and in R2 than in R1 tumors (p=0.016). Statistical analysis showed that there was no relationship between tumor c-erbB-2 or EGFR content and any other patient or tumor characteristics. However, high levels of EGFR were significantly associated with a shorter overall survival (P=0.01). Conclusion: Our data suggest a role of both transmembrane proteins in the progression of gastric cancer. EGFR and cerbB-2 contents in unresectable gastric cancer could be utilized as appropriate biological markers for selecting candidates for treatment based on EGFR and/or c-erbR-2 inhibition.

J	Lazareno, S; Popham, A; Birdsall, NJM				Lazareno, S; Popham, A; Birdsall, NJM			Towards a high-affinity allosteric enhancer at muscarinic M<sub>1</sub> receptors	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						acetylcholine; muscarinic; allosteric; receptor; Alzheimer's disease	POSITIVE COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS; BRUCINE ANALOGS; ACETYLCHOLINE; STRYCHNINE	Loss of forebrain acetylcholine (ACh) is an early neurochemical lesion in Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and muscarinic receptors for ACh are involved in memory and cognition, so a muscarinic agonist could provide 'replacement therapy' in this disease. Muscarinic receptors, which couple to G-proteins, occur throughout the CNS, and in the periphery they mediate the responses of the parasympathetic nervous system, so selectivity is crucial. The five subtypes of muscarinic receptor, M-1-M-5, have a distinct regional distribution, with M-2 and M-3 mediating most of the peripheral effects, M-2 predominating in hindbrain areas, and M-1 predominating in the cortex and hippocampus-the brain regions most associated with memory and cognition, which has lead to a search for a truly M-1-selective muscarinic agonist. That search has so far been unsuccessful, but acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil (Aricept), which potentiate cholinergic neurotransmission, have a therapeutic role in the management of AD; so the M-1 receptor remains a therapeutic target. Our approach is to develop allosteric enhancers-compounds which bind to the receptor at an 'allosteric' site which is distinct from the 'primary' site to which the endogenous ligand binds, and which enhance the affinity (or efficacy) of the endogenous ligand. We have developed radioligand binding assays and analyses for the detection and quantitatitation of allosteric interactions of a test agent with labelled and unlabelled 'primary' ligands, and we report here some results of the initial phase of a chemical synthesis project to develop potent and selective allosteric enhancers at muscarinic M-1 receptors.

We have conducted a detailed pharmacological characterization of the binding of [H-3]-PGE(2) to recombinant human EP1 prostanoid receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells using a broad panel of natural and synthetic prostanoids. The receptor displayed high affinity (K-d = 16.0+/-0.69 nm; n = 3) for [H-3]PGE(2), and was expressed at high levels (B-max=3.69+/-0.30pmol (mg protein)(-1)) in cell membranes of HEK-293 cells. Specific binding constituted 97.5+/-1.4% (n = 12) of the total binding. In competition assays, the rank order of affinities of natural prostanoids for the receptor was PGE(2) > PGE(1) > PGF(2) > PGI(2) > PGD(2). PGE(2) Was more effective than PGE(1) at displacing bound [H-3]-PGE(2) (K-i for PGE(2) = 14.9+/-2.2 nm; K-i for PGE(1) = 165+/-29 nm). The affinities of enprostil (K-i = 14.5 +/- 3.1 nm) and 17-phenyl-omega-trinor-PGE(2) (K-i = 7.3+/-2.7 nm) for the receptor were quite similar to that of PGE(2), while that of sulprostone (K-i = 137 +/- 13 nm) more closely resembled PGE(1). Some compounds historically classified as specific for DIP prostanoid receptors bound with relatively high affinity to the recombinant human EP1, receptor (e.g. ZK118182 (K-i = 73.4+/-8.6 nm) and ZK110841 (K-i = 166+/-20 nm)). All FP (e.g. travoprost acid, fluprostenol), IP (iloprost) and TP (SQ29548) receptor-specific ligands exhibited low affinity (K-i greater than or equal to 1 muM).

The interaction of racemic (+/- )RS amisulpride and its two enantiomers (+)R and (-)S with dopamine D-2 and dopamine D-3 receptors subtypes were compared with that of haloperidol. Binding studies were performed using either [H-3]spiperone or [H-3]nemonapride in baculovirus/Spodoptera frugiperda insect (Sf-9) cell system expressing either the human dopamine recombinant D(2)long (hD(2L)) or the rat dopamine recombinant D-3 (rD(3)) receptors. K-i values at dopamine rD(3) receptors were similar regardless of the radioligand used, whereas at hD(2L) receptors values were higher using [3H]spiperone than [H-3]nemonapride, However, the rank order of compound potency against radiolabeled spiperone or nemonapride both at dopamine hD(2L) and at dopamine rD(3) receptors was similar. (-)S amisulpride displaced [H-3]spiperone or [H-3]nemonapride binding from both dopamine hD(2L) or dopamine rD(3) receptors, being twofold more potent than the racemic form and 38-19-fold more potent than (+)R enantiomer. Both racemic and the (-)S enantiomer exhibited 2-4 ([H-3]spiperone)- and 3-4 ([H-3]nemonapride)-fold higher affinity than haloperidol for dopamine rD(3) receptor, respectively. The (+)R enantiomer has weaker affinity with respect to haloperidol for both dopamine hD(2L) and dopamine rD(3) receptors, Our results show that ( -)S amisulpride is the active enantiomer of amisulpride, showing high affinity for dopamine D-3 and dopamine D-2 receptors.

Summary Background Data Although monocyte activation and the resultant dysregulated cytokine production are now the accepted hallmarks of systemic inflammatory response syndrome, no information is available on the status of bone marrow monocyte production under injury conditions; neither has the balance between the two arms of myelopoiesis (monocytopoiesis and granulocytopoiesis) been delineated. Methods Peripheral blood absolute neutrophil and monocyte counts were determined 72 hours after the initial injury in sham, burn, and burn sepsis mice. Colony-forming potential in response to colony-stimulating factors (granulocyte, macrophage, and granulocyte/macrophage) was determined in both total nucleated and monocyte progenitor enriched bone marrow cells. Dual color flow cytometry was used to document the distribution pattern of monocyte progenitors. Macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor density in monocyte progenitors was assessed by I-125 macrophage colony-stimulating factor binding assay. Results Burn sepsis induced circulating monocytosis and granulocytopenia. Colony-forming assays demonstrated an increase in the growth potential of monocyte progenitors and a significant decrease in granulocyte progenitors after burn and burn sepsis. Flow cytometric analysis of early (ER-MP12) and late (ER-MP20) monocyte progenitors showed an increase in monocyte lineage growth in burn sepsis. Radioligand binding assay demonstrated an increase in macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor expression in monocyte progenitors in burn sepsis. Conclusions The data validate the premise that enhanced monocytopoiesis in thermal injury and sepsis results from an imbalance in myelopoiesis that is driven by the increased expression of macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor.

In this study, we pharmacologically characterized its putative binding site and mechanism of intracellular signaling. Radioligand binding assay showed that [S-35]AVP(4-9) could detect specific binding sites in the rat hippocampus membrane preparations, and the binding site was specifically displaced by AVP(4-9) but not byeither V-1 or V-2 antagonists. Furthermore, [S-35]AVP(4-9) could not detect the cloned rat V-1a, V-1b and V-2 vasopressin receptors, Even at a low doses (10-100 pM), AVP(4-9) caused an increase in both inositol(1,4,5)-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P-3) and intracellular-calcium concentrations ([Ca2+](i)) in rat hippocampal cells. The AVP(4-9)-induced [Ca2+](i) increase was partially inhibited by the absence of Ca2+ or by Ca2+-channel blocker, suggesting that AVP(4-9) caused the [Ca2+](i) increase via release from intracellular calcium store as well as influx from extracellular calcium. For the fi;st time, this study provides evidence to show that AVF(4-9) activates Ins(1,4,5)P-3/[Ca2+](i) pathway through a novel type of receptor in rat hippocampus, which might be potentially important in improving the mnemonic function.

J	Soderstrom, K; Johnson, F				Soderstrom, K; Johnson, F			CB1 cannabinoid receptor expression in brain regions associated with zebra finch song control	BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						cannabinoid; songbird; telencephalon; cognitive; development	MESSENGER-RNA; RAT-BRAIN; LESIONS; PHARMACOLOGY; LOCALIZATION; CLONING; MEMORY; SYSTEM; GENES; CDNA	Cannabinoids have been used for millennia through various preparations of Cannabis sativa;. Despite this long history of use, the physiological significance of cannabinoid signaling in the vertebrate CNS is not well understood. High CB1 cannabinoid receptor densities in mammalian telencephalon and the results of behavioral studies suggest that cannabinoids play a role in cognitive function, learning, and memory. Since a network of discrete brain regions in zebra finch telencephalon controls song learning, we hypothesized that cannabinoid signaling may be relevant to songbird vocal development and behavior. Radioligand binding experiments using the cannabinoid a,agonist [H-3]CP-55940 allowed identification of a dense population of high-affinity cannabinoid binding sites in zebra finch neuronal membranes. Northern blotting and RT-PCR experiments demonstrated expression of a predominant zebra finch CB1 mRNA of similar to 5.5 kb. Expression of this CB1 mRNA appears to change over the course of vocal development within the caudal telencephalon. As zebra finch caudal telencephalon contains the higher vocal center (HVC) and the robust nucleus of the archistriatum (RA), regions involved in song learning and production, we further investigated CB1 expression in these areas using in situ hybridization. In situ hybridization revealed that CB1 mRNA is expressed at high levels within both HVC and RA. Overall, these data demonstrate the presence of CBI signaling systems within songbird telencephalon, notably within regions known to be involved in song learning and production. High-level CBI expression in song regions suggests a potential role for cannabinoid signaling in zebra finch vocal development. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Treatment of Prostate Cancer with CD46-targeted 225Ac Alpha Particle Radioimmunotherapy	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							PHARMACOKINETICS; ANTIBODIES; TOXICITY; LIBRARY; BI-213	Purpose: Radiopharmaceutical therapy is changing the standard of care in prostate cancer and other malignancies. We previously reported high CD46 expression in prostate cancer and developed an antibody-drug conjugate and immunoPET agent based on the YS5 antibody, which targets a tumor-selective CD46 epitope. Here, we present the preparation, preclinical efficacy, and toxicity evaluation of [225Ac]DOTA-YS5, a radioimmunotherapy agent based on the YS5 antibody.Experimental Design: [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 was developed, and its therapeutic efficiency was tested on cell-derived (22Rv1, DU145), and patient-derived (LTL-545, LTL484) prostate cancer xenograft models. Biodistribution studies were carried out on 22Rv1 tumor xenograft models to confirm the targeting efficacy. Toxicity analysis of the [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 was carried out on nu/ nu mice to study short-term (acute) and long-term (chronic) toxicity.Results: Biodistribution study shows that [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 agent delivers high levels of radiation to the tumor tissue (11.64% +/- 1.37%ID/g, 28.58% +/- 10.88%ID/g, 29.35% +/- 7.76%ID/g, and 31.78% +/- 5.89%ID/g at 24, 96,168, and 408 hours, respectively), compared with the healthy organs. [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 suppressed tumor size and prolonged survival in cell line- derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Toxicity analysis revealed that the 0.5 mu Ci activity levels showed toxicity to the kidneys, likely due to redistribution of daughter isotope 213Bi.Conclusions: [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 suppressed the growth of cell -derived and patient-derived xenografts, including prostate-specific membrane antigen-positive and prostate-specific membrane anti-gen-deficient models. Overall, this preclinical study confirms that [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 is a highly effective treatment and suggests feasibility for clinical translation of CD46-targeted radioligand therapy in prostate cancer.

Development and Validation of [<SUP>3</SUP>H]OF-NB1 for Preclinical Assessment of GluN1/2B Candidate Drugs	PHARMACEUTICALS			English	Article						GluN1/2B receptors; NMDA; [H-3]ifenprodil; sigma 1 and sigma 2 receptors; receptor occupancy; PET imaging; drug development; neurodegenerative diseases	NMDA RECEPTOR SUBUNITS; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DIFFERENTIAL ROLES; BINDING; SIGMA(1); AFFINITY; GLUN2B; DISCOVERY	GluN2B-enriched N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are implicated in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. No clinically valid GluN1/2B therapeutic exists due to a lack of selective GluN2B imaging tools, and the state-of-the-art [H-3]ifenprodil shows poor selectivity in drug screening. To this end, we developed a tritium-labeled form of OF-NB1, a recently reported selective GluN1/2B positron emission tomography imaging (PET) agent, with a molar activity of 1.79 GBq/mu mol. The performance of [H-3]OF-NB1 and [H-3]ifenprodil was compared through head-to-head competitive binding experiments, using the GluN1/2B ligand CP-101,606 and the sigma-1 receptor (sigma 1R) ligand SA-4503. Contrary to [H-3]ifenprodil, the usage of [H-3]OF-NB1 differentiated between GluN1/2B and sigma 1R binding components. These results were corroborated by observations from PET imaging experiments in Wistar rats using the sigma 1R radioligand [F-18]fluspidine. To unravel the binding modes of OF-NB1 and ifenprodil in GluN1/2B and sigma 1Rs, we performed a retrospective in silico study using a molecular operating environment. OF-NB1 maintained similar interactions to GluN1/2B as ifenprodil, but only ifenprodil successfully fitted in the sigma 1R pocket, thereby explaining the high GluN1/2B selectivity of OF-NB1 compared to ifenprodil. We successfully showed in a proof-of-concept study the superiority of [H-3]OF-NB1 over the gold standard [H-3]ifenprodil in the screening of potential GluN1/2B drug candidates.

Fluoroethylnormemantine, a Novel NMDA Receptor Antagonist, for the Prevention and Treatment of Stress-Induced Maladaptive Behavior	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							TREATMENT-RESISTANT DEPRESSION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; C-FOS EXPRESSION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; ORAL ANTIDEPRESSANT; DOUBLE-BLIND; KETAMINE; HIPPOCAMPUS; GLUTAMATE; ACTIVATION	BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is a common, recurrent illness. Recent studies have implicated the NMDA receptor in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder. (R,S)-ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is an effective antidepressant but has numerous side effects. Here, we characterized a novel NMDA receptor antagonist, fluoroethylnormemantine (FENM), to determine its effectiveness as a prophylactic and/or antidepressant against stress-induced maladaptive behavior. METHODS: Saline, memantine (10 mg/kg), (R,S)-ketamine (30 mg/kg), or FENM (10, 20, or 30 mg/kg) was administered before or after contextual fear conditioning in 12956/SvEv mice. Drug efficacy was assayed using various behavioral tests. Protein expression in the hippocampus was quantified with immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. In vitro radioligand binding was used to assay drug binding affinity. Patch clamp electrophysiology was used to determine the effect of drug administration on glutamatergic activity in ventral hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (vCA3) 1 week after injection. RESULTS: Given after stress, FENM decreased behavioral despair and reduced perseverative behavior. When administered after re-exposure, FENM facilitated extinction learning. As a prophylactic, FENM attenuated learned fear and decreased stress-induced behavioral despair. FENM was behaviorally effective in both male and female mice. (R,S)-ketamine, but not FENM, increased expression of c-fos in vCA3. Both (R,S)-ketamine and FENM attenuated large-amplitude AMPA receptor-mediated bursts in vCA3, indicating a common neurobiological mechanism for further study. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that FENM is a novel drug that is efficacious when administered at various times before or after stress. Future work will further characterize FENM's mechanism of action with the goal of clinical development.

Allosteric Antagonism of the A<sub>2A</sub> Adenosine Receptor by a Series of Bitopic Ligands	CELLS			English	Article						allosteric modulation; GPCR; bitopic ligands; A(2A) adenosine receptor; antagonist	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; AMILORIDE DERIVATIVES; RATIONAL DESIGN; BINDING-SITES; PHARMACOLOGY; MODULATION; CONFORMATIONS; ACTIVATION; EFFICACY; AGONIST	Allosteric antagonism by bitopic ligands, as reported for many receptors, is a distinct modulatory mechanism. Although several bitopic A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR) ligand classes were reported as pharmacological tools, their receptor binding and functional antagonism patterns, i.e., allosteric or competitive, were not well characterized. Therefore, here we systematically characterized A(2A)AR binding and functional antagonism of two distinct antagonist chemical classes. i.e., fluorescent conjugates of xanthine amine congener (XAC) and SCH442416. Bitopic ligands were potent, weak, competitive or allosteric, based on the combination of pharmacophore, linker and fluorophore. Among antagonists tested, XAC, XAC245, XAC488, SCH442416, MRS7352 showed K-i binding values consistent with K-B values from functional antagonism. Interestingly, MRS7396, XAC-X-BY630 (XAC630) and 5-(N,N-hexamethylene)amiloride (HMA) were 9-100 times weaker in displacing fluorescent MRS7416 binding than radioligand binding. XAC245, XAC630, MRS7396, MRS7416 and MRS7322 behaved as allosteric A(2A)AR antagonists, whereas XAC488 and MRS7395 antagonized competitively. Schild analysis showed antagonism slopes of 0.42 and 0.47 for MRS7396 and XAC630, respectively. Allosteric antagonists HMA and MRS7396 were more potent in displacing [H-3]ZM241385 binding than MRS7416 binding. Sodium site D52N mutation increased and decreased affinity of HMA and MRS7396, respectively, suggesting possible preference for different A(2A)AR conformations. The allosteric binding properties of some bitopic ligands were rationalized and analyzed using the Hall two-state allosteric model. Thus, fluorophore tethering to an orthosteric ligand is not neutral pharmacologically and may confer unexpected properties to the conjugate.	[Gao, Zhan-Guo; Toti, Kiran S.; Campbell, Ryan; Suresh, R.

To elucidate its behavior in the brain by positron emission tomography, we synthesize (R,S)-[C-1(1)] isoproterenol by reductive alkylation of (R,S)-norepinephrine with [2-C-11]acetone, which was in turn synthesized in situ under improved conditions afforded a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 54%. The reductive alkylation using NaBH(OAc)(3) as reducing agent in the presence of benzoic acid in DMSO/DMF (60:40 v/v) at 100 degrees C for 10 min gave (R,S)[C-11]isoproterenol in an 87% radio-high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical yield. HPLC separation using a strong cation exchange column, followed by pharmaceutical formulation in the presence of D/ t-tartaric acid, afforded (R,S)-[C-11] isoproterenol with a total radioactivity of 2.0 +/- 0.2 GBq, a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 19 +/- 2%, chemical and radiochemical purities of 71% and > 99%, respectively, and a molar activity of 100 +/- 13 GBq/mu mol (n = 3). The overall synthesis time from the end of the bombardment to pharmaceutical formulation was 48 min. A preliminary preclinical PET study in a rat demonstrated the potential of the radioligand for the evaluation of the penetration of (R,S)-isoproterenol in human brain.

Here we aim to test a new minimally invasive distribution route to the subarachnoid space (SAS) and the flow of IT administrations. We placed a radioligand into SAS during positron emission tomography (PET) scanning as a proof of concept. New method: We injected a C-11-labeled PET-tracer using a surgically placed catheter in the cisterna magna of anesthetized female pigs. The pigs were scanned for 1.5-2 hours in a PET/CT-scanner. The pressure from continuous infusion of artificial CSF (aCSF) promoted distribution of the tracer. The procedure was done under continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. The catheter was made accessible both by externalization through the skin and through a subcutaneously placed sterile titanium port connected to the catheter. After image reconstruction, we used PMOD software to assess the tracer distribution throughout SAS. Internalisation of the catheter to a port enables survival studies. Previous studies performing ventriculography have placed a catheter trough brain cortex and parenchyma; such procedures may affect any behavioural or neurological evaluation, and have an increased risk of bleeding per- and post-operatively (Kaiser & Fruhauf, 2007). Results: The PET-CT visualized tracer was evenly distributed in the SAS. Furthermore, the ICP measurement made it possible to adjust infusion speed within acceptable pressure levels. Conclusion: This new method can be useful for testing distribution of PET-tracers, antibiotics, chemotherapeutics and a wide range of other pharmaceuticals targeting the CNS and spinal cord in large animal models, and potentially later in human.

The theranostic target prostate-specific membrane antigen is expressed in medullary thyroid cancer	HUMAN PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Medullary thyroid cancer; Prostate-specific membrane antigen; Theranostics; Tissue microarray; Immunohistochemistry; Imaging	MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY J591; PSMA; THERAPY; CARCINOMA; NEOVASCULATURE; PET	Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) accounts for 4% of all thyroid cancers and originates from the parafollicular C-cells. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is known for its expression in the epithelium of prostate cancer and has been demonstrated to be useful both for therapeutic and diagnostic purposes as a so-called theranostic target. As PSMA is also expressed in the neovasculature of other solid tumor types, our aim was to assess PSMA expression and its prognostic role in MTC. Tissues from patients that underwent surgery for MTC between 1988 and 2014 in five tertiary referral centers in The Netherlands were included in a tissue microarray. Using immunohistochemistry, total numbers of PSMA and CD31-positive microvessels were evaluated. Results showed that 92% of MTC expressed PSMA in the neovasculature, whereas the tumor cells were consistently negative. The average number of PSMA-positive microvessels did not differ significantly between the primary tumor and initial lymph node metastases (P = .09), nor between initial and recurrent lymph node metastases (P = 1.00). The PSMA score was found to be correlated with progression-free survival and overall survival. In multivariate analysis, a higher number of PSMA-positive microvessels was associated with favorable prognosis (odds ratio 3.6; 95% confidence interval 1.0-12.8; P = .05). In conclusion, over 90% of MTC appears to express PSMA in the neovasculature. A higher number of PSMA-positive microvessels is prognostically favorable. Since it is highly expressed in MTC, PSMA is an interesting novel target for imaging and potentially also as a target for peptide radioligand therapy in MTC. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Chad			Translocator Protein PET Imaging in a Preclinical Prostate Cancer Model	MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						Translocator protein; Prostate cancer; PET	TUMORIGENESIS; DIAGNOSIS; GLIOMA; TSPO	The identification and targeting of biomarkers specific to prostate cancer (PCa) could improve its detection. Given the high expression of translocator protein (TSPO) in PCa, we investigated the use of [F-18]VUIIS1008 (a novel TSPO-targeting radioligand) coupled with positron emission tomography (PET) to identify PCa in mice and to characterize their TSPO uptake. Pten(pc-/-), Trp53(pc-/-) prostate cancer-bearing mice (n = 9, 4-6 months old) were imaged in a 7T MRI scanner for lesion localization. Within 24 h, the mice were imaged using a microPET scanner for 60 min in dynamic mode following a retro-orbital injection of 18 MBq [F-18]VUIIS1008. Following imaging, tumors were harvested and stained with a TSPO antibody. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the tumor and muscle (hind limb) in the PET images. Time-activity curves (TACs) were recorded over the duration of the scan for each ROI. The mean activity concentrations between 40 and 60 min post radiotracer administration between tumor and muscle were compared. Tumor presence was confirmed by visual inspection of the MR images. The uptake of [F-18]VUIIS1008 in the tumors was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in the muscle, where the percent injected dose per unit volume for tumor was 7.1 +/- 1.6 % ID/ml and that of muscle was < 1 % ID/ml. In addition, positive TSPO expression was observed in tumor tissue analysis. The foregoing preliminary data suggest that TSPO may be a useful biomarker of PCa. Therefore, using TSPO-targeting PET ligands, such as [F-18]VUIIS1008, may improve PCa detectability and characterization.	[Tantawy, Mohammed N.; Manning, H.

The mGlu(5) has become an attractive therapeutic and diagnostic target owing to its role in many neuropsychiatric disorders. Several carbon-11-labeled and fluorine-18-labeled radiotracers have been developed to measure mGlu(5) receptor occupancy in the human brain. The radiotracer [F-18]2a, which is used as an analogue for [C-11]ABP688 ([C-11]1) and has a longer physical half-life, is a selective radiotracer that exhibits high binding affinity for mGlu(5). Herein, we report the fully automated radiosynthesis of [F-18]2a using a commercial GE TRACERlab FX-(FN) synthesizer for routine production and distribution to nearby satellite clinics. Nucleophilic substitution of the corresponding mesylate precursor with cyclotron-produced [F-18]fluoride ion at 100 degrees C in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification and formulation, readily provided [F-18]2a with a radiochemical yield of 40 +/- 2% (decay corrected, n=5) at the end of synthesis. Radiochemical purity for the [F-18]-(E)-conformer was greater than 95%. Molar activity was determined to be 63.6 +/- 9.6GBq/mol (n=5), and the overall synthesis time was 70minutes.

Pharmacological modulation of this target represents a potential disease modifying approach for the treatment of substance abuse, depression, schizophrenia, and dementias. While quantification of mGlu(2) receptors in the living brain by positron emission tomography (PET) would help us better understand signaling pathways relevant to these conditions, few successful examples have been demonstrated to image mGlu(2) in vivo, and a suitable PET tracer is yet to be identified. Herein we report the design and synthesis of a radiolabeled negative allosteric modulator (NAM) for mGlu(2) PET tracer development based on a quinoline 2-carboxamide scaffold. The most promising candidate, 74(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-l-yOmethyl)-4-(2-fluoro-4-[C-11]methoxyphenyl) quinoline-2-carboxamide ([C-11]QCA) was prepared in 13% radiochemical yield (non-decay-corrected at the end of synthesis) with >99% radiochemical purity and >74 GBq/pmol (2 Ci/mu mol) specific activity. While the tracer showed limited brain uptake (0.3 SUV), probably attributable to effects on PgP/Bcrp efflux pump, in vitro autoradiography studies demonstrated heterogeneous brain distribution and specific binding. Thus, [C-11]QCA is a chemical probe that provides the basis for the development of a new generation mGlu(2) PET tracers.

Striatal phosphodiesterase 10A and medial prefrontal cortical thickness in patients with schizophrenia: a PET and MRI study	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; GENETIC DELETION; DOPAMINE D-1; PDE10A; EXPRESSION; CLOZAPINE; BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND; VALIDATION; INHIBITORS	The enzyme phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is abundant in striatal medium spiny neurons and has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia in animal models and is investigated as a possible new pharmacological treatment target. A reduction of prefrontal cortical thickness is common in schizophrenia, but how this relates to PDE10A expression is unknown. Our study aim was to compare, we believe for the first time, the striatal non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) of the new validated PDE10A ligand [C-11]Lu AE92686 between patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Furthermore, we aimed to assess the correlation of PDE10A BPND to cortical thickness. Sixteen healthy male controls and 10 male patients with schizophrenia treated with clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine were investigated with positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Striatal binding potential (BPND) of [C-11]Lu AE92686 was acquired through dynamic PET scans and cortical thickness by structural MRI. Clinical assessments of symptoms and cognitive function were performed and the antipsychotic dosage was recorded. Patients with schizophrenia had a significantly lower BPND of [C-11]Lu AE92686 in striatum (P = 0.003) than healthy controls. The striatal BPND significantly correlated to cortical thickness in the medial prefrontal cortex and superior frontal gyrus across patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. No significant correlation was observed between the BPND for [C-11]Lu AE92686 in striatum and age, schizophrenia symptoms, antipsychotic dosage, coffee consumption, smoking, duration of illness or cognitive function in the patients. In conclusion, PDE10A may be important for functioning in the striato-cortical interaction and in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

It has been proposed that a 100-fold faster dissociation from the dopamine D-2 receptor (D2R) distinguishes atypical from typical antipsychotics. Furthermore, differing antipsychotic D2R affinities have been suggested to reflect differences in dissociation rate constants (k(off)), while association rate constants (k(on)) were assumed to be similar. However, it was recently demonstrated that lipophilic accumulation of ligand in the cell interior and/or membrane can cause underestimation of koff, and as high-affinity D2R antagonists are frequently lipophilic, this may have been a confounding factor in previous studies. In the present work, a functional electrophysiology assay was used to measure the recovery of dopamine-mediated D2R responsivity from antipsychotic antagonism, using elevated concentrations of dopamine to prevent the potential bias of re-binding of lipophilic ligands. The variability of antipsychotic kon was also reexamined, capitalizing on the temporal resolution of the assay. kon was estimated from the experimental recordings using a simple mathematical model assumed to describe the binding process. The time course of recovery from haloperidol (typical antipsychotic) was only 6.4- to 2.5-fold slower than that of the atypical antipsychotics, amisulpride, clozapine, and quetiapine, while antipsychotic kons were found to vary more widely than previously suggested. Finally, affinities calculated using our kon and koff estimates correlated well with functional potency and with affinities reported from radioligand binding studies. In light of these findings, it appears unlikely that typical and atypical antipsychotics are primarily distinguished by their D2R binding kinetics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

We have studied changes in kappa opioid receptor (KOR) binding availability in vivo with PET following kappa opioid agonist administration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n=31) were anesthetized and treated with the (KOR) agonist salvinorin A (0.01-1.8 mg/kg, i.v.) before administration of the KOR selective radiotracer [C-11]GR103545. When salvinorin A was administered 1 min prior to injection of the radiotracer, [C-11]GR103545 binding potential (BPND) was decreased in a dose-dependent manner, indicating receptor binding competition. In addition, the unique pharmacokinetics of salvinorin A (half-life similar to 8 min in non-human primates) allowed us to study the residual impact on KOR after the drug had eliminated from the brain. Salvinorin A was administered up to 5 h prior to [C-11]GR103545, and the changes in BPND were compared with baseline, 2.5 h, 1 h, and 1 min pretreatment times. At lower doses (0.18 mg/kg and 0.32 mg/kg) we observed no prolonged effect on KOR binding but at 0.60 mg/kg salvinorin A induced a sustained decrease in KOR binding (BPND decreased by 40-49%) which persisted up to 2.5 h post administration, long after salvinorin A had been eliminated from the brain. These data point towards an agonist-induced adaptive response by KOR, the dynamics of which have not been previously studied in vivo with PET.

Positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers are widely used in clinical drug development targeted to brain receptors and can also in some cases be employed to monitor extracellular (synaptic) neurotransmitter concentrations. The objective of this study is to test the sensitivity of [C-11]ORM-13070 uptake to increased concentrations of extracellular (synaptic) noradrenaline in the human brain. Eight subjects underwent a control PET scan with [C-11]ORM-13070, a subtype-selective alpha(2C)-adrenoceptor antagonist radioligand, and two PET scans after two different noradrenaline challenges, i.e. during ketamine infusion and after a dose of atomoxetine combined with cold stimulation. Tracer uptake in the caudate nucleus and putamen was described with AUC values in scan time windows of 10-20 and 5-30 min post injection and quantified with the ratio method. Voxel-based analysis was performed with average bound per free (B/F) ratio images. Both noradrenaline challenges were consistently associated with 10-20 % (p < 0.05) reductions in tracer uptake in the dorsal striatum, as determined with region-of-interest-based analysis. Voxel-based analysis revealed significant reductions in B/F ratios in the dorsal striatum, in the brain stem and in several cortical areas. Reductions of 24 and 23 % were detected in the peak putamen clusters with ketamine and atomoxetine + cold, respectively. Direct experimental support was gained for the suitability of [C-11]ORM-13070 for imaging of brain noradrenergic neurotransmission.

REELIN INFLUENCES THE EXPRESSION AND FUNCTION OF DOPAMINE D<sub>2</sub> AND SEROTONIN 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> RECEPTORS: A COMPARATIVE STUDY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						reelin; heterozygous reeler mice; striatum; frontal ortex; GPCRs; schizophrenia	PUTATIVE VULNERABILITY FACTOR; FRONTAL-CORTEX; DOWN-REGULATION; MESSENGER-RNA; BIPOLAR DISORDER; DENDRITIC SPINE; SCHIZOPHRENIA; BRAIN; MICE; POSTMORTEM	Reelin is an extracellular matrix protein that plays a critical role in neuronal guidance during brain neurodevelopment and in synaptic plasticity in adults and has been associated with schizophrenia. Reelin mRNA and protein levels are reduced in various structures of post-mortem schizophrenic brains, in a similar way to those found in heterozygous reeler mice (HRM). Reelin is involved in protein expression in dendritic spines that are the major location where synaptic connections are established. Thus, we hypothesized that a genetic deficit in reelin would affect the expression and function of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors that are associated with the action of current antipsychotic drugs. In this study, D2 and 5-HT2A receptor expression and function were quantitated by using radioligand binding studies in the frontal cortex and striatum of HRM and wild-type mice (WTM). We observed increased expression (p < 0.05) in striatum membranes and decreased expression (p < 0.05) in frontal cortex membranes for both dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors from HRM compared to WTM. Our results show parallel alterations of D2 and 5-HT2A receptors that are compatible with a possible hetero-oligomeric nature of these receptors. These changes are similar to changes described in schizophrenic patients and provide further support for the suitability of using HRM as a model for studying this disease and the effects of antipsychotic drugs.

The study aim was to further evaluate in vivo neuroinflammation in individuals with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using [C-11]-PBR28 positron emission tomography. Ten patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (seven males, three females, 38-68 years) and ten age-and [C-11]-PBR28 binding affinity-matched healthy volunteers (six males, four females, 33-65 years) completed a positron emission tomography scan. Standardized uptake values were calculated from 60 to 90 min post-injection and normalized to whole brain mean. Voxel-wise analysis showed increased binding in the motor cortices and corticospinal tracts in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis compared to healthy controls (p(FWE) < 0.05). Region of interest analysis revealed increased [C-11]-PBR28 binding in the precentral gyrus in patients (normalized standardized uptake value = 1.15) compared to controls (1.03, p < 0.05). In patients those values were positively correlated with upper motor neuron burden scores (r = 0.69, p < 0.05), and negatively correlated with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis functional rating scale (r = -0.66, p < 0.05). Increased in vivo glial activation in motor cortices, that correlates with phenotype, complements previous histopathological reports. Further studies will determine the role of [C-11]-PBR28 as a marker of treatments that target neuroinflammation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

We have identified a patient with a history of significant bleeding, who expresses a novel heterozygous thromboxane receptor variant that predicts an asparagine to serine substitution (N42S). This asparagine is conserved across all class A GPCRs, suggesting a vital role for receptor structure and function. We investigated the functional consequences of the TP receptor heterozygous N42S substitution by performing platelet function studies on platelet-rich plasma taken from the patient and healthy controls. We investigated the N42S mutation by expressing the wild-type (WT) and mutant receptor in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Aggregation studies showed an ablation of arachidonic acid responses in the patient, whilst there was right-ward shift of the U46619 concentration response curve (CRC). Thromboxane generation was unaffected. Calcium mobilisation studies in cells lines showed a rightward shift of the U46619 CRC in N42S-expressing cells compared to WT. Radioligand binding studies revealed a reduction in BMax in platelets taken from the patient and in N42S-expressing cells, whilst cell studies confirmed poor surface expression. We have identified a novel thromboxane receptor variant, N42S, which results in platelet dysfunction due to reduced surface expression. It is associated with a significant bleeding history in the patient in whom it was identified. This is the first description of a naturally occurring variant that results in the substitution of this highly conserved residue and confirms the importance of this residue for correct GPCR function.

Sets of mutations were identified, which both thermostabilized the receptor and resulted in preferential agonist (Rag23 mutant) or antagonist (Rant5 and Rant21) binding forms as assessed by radioligand binding analysis. While the ligand-binding profiles of these mutants are known, the effects these mutations have on receptor activation and downstream signalling are less well characterized. Experimental Approach Here we have investigated the effects of the thermostabilizing mutations on receptor activation using a yeast cell growth assay. The assay employs an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae, MMY24, which couples receptor activation to cell growth. Key Results Analysis of the receptor activation profile revealed that the wild-type (WT) A2AR had considerable constitutive activity. In contrast, the Rag23, Rant5 and Rant21 thermostabilized mutants all exhibited no constitutive activity. While the preferentially antagonist-binding mutants Rant5 and Rant21 showed a complete lack of agonist-induced activity, the Rag23 mutant showed high levels of agonist-induced receptor activity. Further analysis using a mutant intermediate between Rag23 and WT indicated that the loss of constitutive activity observed in the agonist responsive mutants was not due to reduced G-protein coupling. Conclusions and Implications The loss of constitutive activity may be an important feature of these thermostabilized GPCRs. In addition, the constitutively active and agonist-induced active conformations of the A2AR are distinct.

INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; IN-VIVO; NALTREXONE; QUANTIFICATION; COCAINE; PET; RECEPTORS; STRIATUM; NEUROTRANSMISSION	Studies in rodents have shown that psychostimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamine cause endorphin release in the brain reward system. There is also evidence for the involvement of the opioid system in human psychostimulant dependence. The acute effects of an i.v. psychostimulant drug on the brain opioid system, however, have not yet been investigated in humans. We hypothesized that an i.v. dose of amphetamine as compared to placebo would cause an opioid release in the human brain reward system, measurable as a reduction of the binding potential of the m-opioid receptor radioligand [C-11] carfentanil. Ten healthy young men were examined using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11] carfentanil in three sessions : at baseline; after placebo; after an i.v. amphetamine dose of 0.3 mg/kg bodyweight. The order of amphetamine and placebo was double-blinded and randomized. PET examinations were performed with a Siemens high resolution research tomograph. Data were analysed with the simplified reference tissue model, applying manually drawn regions of interest for every subject. Using repeated measures analysis of variance, we found no significant differences in [C-11] carfentanil binding potential between amphetamine and placebo conditions in any of the investigated brain regions. In contrast to data from rodent studies and a recent study of oral amphetamine administration in humans, an i.v. dose of amphetamine does not cause any acute opioid release in healthy human subjects. The postulated role of the opioid system in mediating the effects of amphetamine needs to be further investigated in animal models of the disease as well as in patient populations.

Lack of evidence that nebivolol is a β<sub>3</sub>-adrenoceptor agonist	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Nebivolol; Urinary bladder; Chinese hamster ovary cell; beta(3)-Adrenoceptor	NITRIC-OXIDE RELEASE; 3RD-GENERATION BETA-BLOCKER; BLADDER SMOOTH-MUSCLE; RAT URINARY-BLADDER; POTASSIUM CHANNELS; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; THORACIC AORTA; DL-NEBIVOLOL; ADRENOCEPTORS; VASORELAXATION	Nebivolol is a selective beta(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist which, in addition, displays endothelium-dependent vasodilating properties in humans and other species. beta(3)-Adrenoceptors have been proposed to be a molecular target of nebivolol-induced vasodilatation. Therefore, we have investigated possible beta(3)-adrenoceptor agonism by nebivolol for relaxation of the human and rat urinary bladder (prototypical beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated responses) as well as for cAMP accumulation in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human pradrenoceptor subtypes. Nebivolol concentration-dependently relaxed both human and rat isolated urinary bladder strips but with low potency, similar to that reported for vasodilatation. However, nebivolol-induced bladder relaxation in either species was not inhibited by the beta(3)-adrenoceptor antagonist SR 59,230A (10 mu M), although this compound inhibited the isoprenaline-induced relaxation with the expected potency. In radioligand binding studies nebivolol had lower affinity for human beta(3)-adrenoceptors than the other two beta-adrenoceptor subtypes, but this low affinity was in line with its potency to relax the bladder or isolated blood vessels. In functional studies nebivolol even in high concentrations did not stimulate cAMP formation via any of the three cloned human beta-adrenoceptors or in rat bladder smooth muscle cells. Taken together these data demonstrate that nebivolol can relax not only vascular but also urinary bladder smooth muscle. However, they do not support the hypothesis that nebivolol is an agonist at cloned human beta(3)-adrenoceptors or in rat or human urinary bladder. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

SPECT imaging with the serotonin transporter radiotracer [<SUP>123</SUP>I]<i>p</i> ZIENT in nonhuman primate brain	NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY			English	Article						SPECT; Brain imaging; Serotonin transporter; Nonhuman primate; [I-123]p ZIENT	NOR-BETA-CIT; AVAILABILITY; BINDING; RECEPTOR; DOPAMINE; DISORDER	Introduction: Serotonin dysfunction has been linked to a variety of psychiatric diseases; however, an adequate SPECT radioligand to probe the serotonin transporter system has not been successfully developed. The purpose of this study was to characterize and determine the in vivo selectivity of iodine-123-labeled 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4'-((Z)-2-iodoethenyl)phenyl)nortropane, [I-123]p ZIENT, in nonhuman primate brain. Methods: Two ovariohysterectomized female baboons participated in nine studies (one bolus and eight bolus to constant infusion at a ratio of 9.0 h) to evaluate [I-123]p ZIENT. To evaluate the selectivity of [I-123]p ZIENT, the serotonin transporter blockers fenfluramine (1.5, 2.5 mg/kg) and citalopram (5 mg/kg), the dopamine transporter blocker methylphenidate (0.5 mg/kg) and the norepinephrine transporter blocker nisoxetine (1 mg/kg) were given at 8 h post-radiotracer injection. Results: In the bolus to constant infusion studies, equilibrium was established by 4-8 h. [I-123]p ZIENT was 93% and 90% protein bound in the two baboons and there was no detection of lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites entering the brain. In the high-density serotonin transporter regions (diencephalon and brainstem), fenfluramine and citalopram resulted in 35-71% and 129-151% displacement, respectively, whereas methylphenidate and nisoxetine did not produce significant changes (<10%). Conclusion: These findings suggest that [I-123]p ZIENT is a favorable compound for in vivo SPECT imaging of serotonin transporters with negligible binding to norepinephrine and dopamine transporters.

RBx 6198 is a potent (nanomolar affinity) alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist with demonstrable uroselectivity in anaesthesized dog model. In radioligand binding studies using human recombinant receptors, RBx 6198 exhibited high selectivity (similar to 50 fold) for the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor subtype as compared to alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor subtype. In order to assess tissue selectivity, the antagonistic effect: of RBx 6198 on the phenylephrine induced contractile response of isolated rat prostate, spleen and aorta was characterized. RBx 6198 was 8 fold more potent in inhibiting phenylephrine-evoked contractions of isolated tissues compared to tamsulosin. However, the compound was non-selective for alpha(1A) vs. alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor like tamsulosin. In anaesthetized beagle dogs RBx 6198 suppressed the intraurethral pressure response to phenylephrine to a greater extent than the mean arterial pressure response thereby demonstrating uroselectivity consistent with in vitro binding and functional data. RBx 6198 was 6.4 fold more uroselective as compared to tamsulosin after i.v. route dose administration. Taken together all results from preclinical studies, it is suggested that RBx 6198 is a novel alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist that exhibited improved pharmacological profile over tamsulosin in both in vitro and in vivo.

Internalization of H-1 receptors was induced without their degradation by treatment with 0.1 mM histamine for 30 min at 37 degrees C, and then the intact cell binding assay was performed at 4 degrees C. The binding properties of [H-3]mepyramine, a cell-penetrating radioligand for H-1 receptors, were not changed by histamine pretreatment. Displacement curves for sedative H-1-receptor antagonists (diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, promethazine, ketotifen, azelastine and oxatomide) against [H-3]mepyramine binding were not changed by histamine pretreatment. In contrast, the displacement curves for non-sedative H-1-receptor antagonists (mequitazine, bepotastine, olopatadine, epinastine, carebastine, desloratadine and fexofenadine) were changed by histamine pretreatment: two types of changes, i.e. a rightward shift in the monophasic curve or an increase in the proportion of the low affinity component of the biphasic curve, were prevented under hypertonic conditions, in which clathrin-mediated receptor internalization is known to be inhibited. Thus, internalization-mediated changes in the binding properties of H-1-receptor antagonists were well correlated with their sedative and non-sedative behaviors, which might confirm their permeability through the biomembrane and possibly the blood brain barrier.

Additionally, relations between radioligand binding to DAT and D-2 and positive symptoms were assessed. Methods: Twenty acutely ill inpatients suffering from a first acute schizophrenic episode and 12 healthy control persons participated in the study. Patients were naive with respect to neuroleptic or antidepressant medication. A dual-isotope SPECT protocol was performed using combined application of [99mTc]TRODAT-1 and [1231]IBZM. On the day of SPECT, psychopathology was assessed in the patient group by PANSS rating. Results: In the patient but not in the healthy control group there was a significant correlation between DAT and D-2 receptor availability. Patients with predominant positive symptoms (n = 12) had a significantly higher DAT availability compared to the healthy control group. An inverse correlation between DAT and D-2 availability and the extent of "delusions", "conceptual disorganization", and "hallucinatory behaviour" could be demonstrated. Discussion: The data obtained with this dual-isotope SPECT technique show a change in interaction between striatal DAT and D-2 receptor in first-episode, never-treated schizophrenic patients. Additionally, an association between dopamine transmission and the core symptoms of the acute psychotic syndrome was found. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Schmitt, G. J.

Dysregulation of glutamate carboxypeptidase II in psychiatric disease	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						schizophrenia; bipolar disorder; depression; NAALADase; GCPII; [I-125]DCIT; human brain; imaging	MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; N-ACETYLASPARTYLGLUTAMATE; IN-VIVO; SCHIZOPHRENIA; NAAG; MODEL; HIPPOCAMPUS; HYDROLYSIS; EXPRESSION; DEFICIT	Experimental evidence is beginning to converge on an important role for dysregulation of glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) in schizophrenia. The goal of this study was to determine GCPII levels in postmortem brain specimens of patients with schizophrenia.. bipolar disorder or unipolar depression and age-matched control subjects. We used N-[N-(S)-1,3-dicarboxypropyl] carbamoyl]-S-3-[I-125]iodo-L-tyrosine ([I-125]DCIT), a high-affinity radioligand for GCPII, to probe for GCPII expression in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and mesial temporal lobe, two brain regions implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. We found that GCPII levels measured by [I-125]DCIT quantitative autoradiography were significantly lower in the PFC and entorhinal cortex in patients with schizophrenia compared to age-matched controls. Patients with bipolar disorder also expressed significantly lower GCPII levels in PFC than controls. The decrease in [I-125]DCIT binding in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder remained significant after adjusting for drug abuse. A significant difference in GCPII levels was also observed between schizophrenia relative to bipolar disorder and depressed subjects in the hippocampus-stratum lucidum and between schizophrenia and bipolar in the CA2 region of the hippocampus, with bipolar and depressed subjects expressing higher levels of GCPII than subjects with schizophrenia. These differences in hippocampal GCPII levels may implicate differences in the etiologies of these mental disorders. In summary, this study demonstrates a regional dysregulation of GCPII expression in the brain of patients with schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders and supports a hypoglutamatergic state of the former illness. GCPII may represent a viable therapeutic target for intervention in psychiatric disease. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Estimation of d2-like receptor occupancy by dopamine in the putamen of hemiparkinsonian monkeys	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						PET; [C-11]raclopride; MPTP model of PD; striatum	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; MPTP-INDUCED PARKINSONISM; D2 RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; HIGH-AFFINITY; SYNAPTIC DOPAMINE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; BRAIN DOPAMINE	To advance understanding of the neurochemical changes in Parkinson's disease (PD), we compared D2-like dopamine receptor occupancy by dopamine in the control and lesioned putamen of four pig-tailed macaques treated unilaterally with MPTP. PET and in vitro binding techniques were used to measure binding potential (BP*) and density of D2-like dopamine receptors (B-max), respectively. As would be expected in PD, relatively higher values of BP* and Bmax and less amphetamine-induced decrease in [C-11]raclopride binding were observed in the lesioned compared with the contralateral putamen in each animal. The percent differences between lesioned and contralateral sides were similar whether the measurements were of [C-11]raclopride BP* or Bmax values, measured in vivo and in vitro, respectively. As [C-11] raclopride BP* is a measure of the density of D2-like dopamine receptors available for radioligand binding (i.e., not occupied by dopamine), these findings suggest that the fractional occupancy of receptors by endogenous dopamine in the lesioned putamen is nearly equal to that in the contralateral putamen. Therefore, the absolute number of receptors occupied by dopamine, which is a product of receptor density and fractional occupancy by dopamine, is greater in the lesioned than in the contralateral putamen. One possible explanation for the lack of differences in fractional occupancy of D2 receptors by dopamine (despite a loss in available dopamine) is a lesion-induced increase in a portion of low-affinity D2 receptors to a state of high affinity for dopamine.

We used allosteric small molecules as a novel approach to better understand conformational changes underlying the inactive-to-active switch in native receptors. Allosteric molecules bind outside the orthosteric area for the endogenous receptor activator. The human muscarinic M-2 acetylcholine receptor is prototypal for the study of allosteric interactions. We measured receptor-mediated G protein activation, applied a series of structurally diverse muscarinic allosteric agents, and analyzed their cooperative effects with orthosteric receptor agonists. A strong negative cooperativity of receptor binding was observed with acetylcholine and other full agonists, whereas a pronounced negative cooperativity of receptor activation was observed with the partial agonist pilocarpine. Applying a newly synthesized allosteric tool, point mutated receptors, radioligand binding, and a three-dimensional receptor model, we found that the deviating allosteric/orthosteric interactions are mediated through the core region of the allosteric site. A key epitope is M(2)Trp(422) in position 7.35 that is located at the extracellular top of transmembrane helix 7 and that contacts, in the inactive receptor, the extracellular loop E2. Trp 7.35 is critically involved in the divergent allosteric/orthosteric cooperativities with acetylcholine and pilocarpine, respectively. In the absence of allosteric agents, Trp 7.35 is essential for receptor binding of the full agonist and for receptor activation by the partial agonist. This study provides first evidence for a role of an allosteric E2/transmembrane helix 7 contact region for muscarinic receptor activation by orthosteric agonists.

CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR CXCR4; CELL-DERIVED FACTOR-1-ALPHA; LYMPH-NODE METASTASIS; GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN-BINDING; ENDOTHELIAL-CELLS; TUMOR-GROWTH; IN-VIVO; MIGRATION; EXPRESSION; OLIGOMERIZATION	Purpose: The pattern of breast cancer metastasis may be determined by interactions between CXCR4 on breast cancer cells and CXCL12 within normal tissues. Glycosaminoglycans bind chemokines for presentation to responsive cells. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that soluble heparinoid glycosaminoglycan molecules can disrupt the normal response to CXCL12, thereby reducing the metastasis of CXCR4-expressing cancer cells. Experimental Design: Inhibition of the response of CXCR4-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells to CXCL12 was assessed by measurement of calcium flux and chemotaxis. Radioligand binding was also assessed to quantify the potential of soluble heparinoids to prevent specific receptor ligation. The human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 and a range of sublines were assessed for their sensitivity to heparinoid-mediated inhibition of chemotaxis. A model of hematogenous breast cancer metastasis was established, and the potential of clinically relevant doses of heparinoids to inhibit CXCL12 presentation and metastatic disease was assessed. Results: Unfractionated heparin and the low-molecular-weight heparin tinzaparin inhibited receptor ligation and the response of CXCR4-expressing Chinese hamster ovary cells and human breast cancer cell lines to CXCL12. Heparin also removed CXCL12 from its normal site of expression on the surface of parenchymal cells in the murine lung. Both heparin and two clinically relevant dose regimens of tinzaparin reduced hematogenous metastatic spread of human breast cancer cells to the lung in a murine model. Conclusions: Clinically relevant concentrations of tinzaparin inhibit the interaction between CXCL12 and CXCR4 and may be useful to prevent chemokine-driven breast cancer metastasis.

Desvenlafaxine succinate: A new serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							IN-VIVO; TRANSPORTER; DULOXETINE; ANTIDEPRESSANT; VENLAFAXINE; EXPRESSION; 5-HT1A; PAIN; AUTORECEPTORS; RECEPTORS	The purpose of this study was to characterize a new chemical entity, desvenlafaxine succinate (DVS). DVS is a novel salt form of the isolated major active metabolite of venlafaxine. Competitive radioligand binding assays were performed using cells expressing either the human serotonin (5-HT) transporter (hSERT) or norepinephrine (NE) transporter (hNET) with K-i values for DVS of 40.2 +/- 1.6 and 558.4 +/- 121.6 nM, respectively. DVS showed weak binding affinity (62% inhibition at 100 mu M) at the human dopamine (DA) transporter. Inhibition of [H-3]5-HT or [H-3] NE uptake by DVS for the hSERT or hNET produced IC50 values of 47.3 +/- 19.4 and 531.3 +/- 113.0 nM, respectively. DVS (10 mu M), examined at a large number of nontransporter targets, showed no significant activity. DVS (30 mg/kg orally) rapidly penetrated the male rat brain and hypothalamus. DVS (30 mg/kg orally) significantly increased extracellular NE levels compared with baseline in the male rat hypothalamus but had no effect on DA levels using microdialysis. To mimic chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment and to block the inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptors, a 5-HT1A antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclo hexanecarboxamide maleate salt (WAY-100635) (0.3 mg/kg s.c.), was administered with DVS (30 mg/kg orally). 5-HT increased 78% compared with baseline with no additional increase in NE or DA levels. In conclusion, DVS is a new 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor in vitro and in vivo that demonstrates good brain-to-plasma ratios, suggesting utility in a variety of central nervous system-related disorders.

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of inhibition of these receptors is important for the development of new tools for drug discovery. Our objective has been to determine the pharmacological activity of the antagonist suramin, the most important antagonist of purinergic receptor function, as well as to demonstrate its noncompetitive inhibition and confirm a competitive mechanism between ATP and TNP-ATP in 1321N1 glial cells stably transfected with the recombinant rat P2X(2) receptor. A radioligand binding assay was employed to determine whether suramin, TNP-ATP, and ATP compete for the same binding site on the receptor. TNP-ATP displaced [alpha-P-32]ATP, whereas suramin did not interfere with [alpha-P-32]ATP-receptor binding. To determine the inhibition mechanism relevant for channel opening, currents obtained in fast kinetic whole-cell recording experiments, following stimulation of cells by ATP in the presence of suramin, were compared to those obtained by ATP in the presence of TNP-ATP. Supported by a mathematical model for receptor kinetics [Breitinger, H. G., Geetha, N., and Hess, G. P. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 84198429], the inhibition factors were plotted as functions of inhibitor or agonist concentrations. Analysis of the data indicated a competitive inhibition mechanism for TNP-ATP and a noncompetitive inhibition for suramin. Taken together, both data support a noncompetitive inhibition mechanism of the rat recombinant P2X(2) receptor by suramin, confirm the competitive inhibition by TNP-ATP, and allow the prediction of a model for P2X(2) receptor inhibition.

In vitro characterization using CHO-cells expressing different dopamine receptor subtypes gave K-i values of 2.1 (5a) and 9.9 nM (5b) for the dopamine D-4 subtype and displayed a 420-fold D-4-selectivity over D-2 receptors for 5b. The para-fluoroethoxy substituted candidate 5b revealed substantially reduced a, and serotoninergic binding affinities in comparison to the ortho-fluoroethoxy substituted compound. In order to provide potential positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probes for the dopamine D4 receptor, F-18-labelling conditions using [F-18]fluoroethyl tosylate were optimized and led to radiochemical yields of 81 +/- 5% ([F-18]5a) and 47 +/- 4% ([F-18]5b) (n = 3, decay-corrected and referred to labelling agent), respectively. Thus, F-18-fluoroethylation favourably at the para position of the phenylpiperazine moiety of the 5-cyano-indole framework proved to be tolerated by D-4 receptors and could also be applied to alternative scaffolds in order to develop D-4 radioligand candidates for PET with improved D-4 receptor affinity and selectivity.

Because neuropeptide calcitonin is secreted by prostate tumors and endothelial cells are known to express calcitonin receptor-like receptor, we examined the potential action of calcitonin on endothelial cells. The presence of calcitonin receptor, calcitonin receptor-like receptor, and receptor activity-modifying proteins in human microvessel endothelial-1 cells was tested by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RTPCR). The proangiogenic action of calcitonin was examined in several in vitro models of angiogenesis using HMEC-1 cells and also in vivo using dorsal skinfold assays. Calcitonin expression of PC-3M cells was modulated, and its effect on angiogenesis was examined in in vitro as well as in vivo models. The results of RT-PCR and radioligand receptor assays showed the presence of functional calcitonin receptor in HMEC-1 cells. Calcitonin stimulated all phases of angiogenesis through the calcitonin receptor, but its effect on tube morphogenesis by endothelial cells occurred at the concentration of the K-d of calcitonin receptor. Silencing of calcitonin receptor expression in HMEC-1 cells abolished calcitonin-induced tube formation. Vascular endothelial growth factor antibodies attenuated but did not abolish calcitonin-induced tube morphogenesis. PC-3M prostate cancer cells induced angiogenesis in in vivo and in vitro models. Overexpression of calcitonin in PC-3M cells increased their angiogenic activity, whereas the silencing of calcitonin expression abolished it. These results show that prostate tumor-derived calcitonin may play an important role in prostate tumor growth by regulating intratumoral vascularization.

A promotion effect by applying exogenous purified calmodulin and an inhibition effect by the addition of anti-calmodulin anti-serum or calmodulin antagonist to the medium on proliferation of suspension cells were found by monitoring incorporation of [methyl-H-3]thymidine into nuclear DNA. Radioligand binding analysis with S-35-labeled calmodulin indicated the presence of specific, reversible, and saturable calmodulin binding sites on the surface of both A. thaliana suspension-cultured cells and its protoplasts; among them at least one is on the surface of Arabidopsis protoplasts, with the K-d similar to 9.2 nM, and two are on the out-surface of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, with K-d values of similar to 47.5 and 830 nM. Chemical cross-linking of S-35-labeled calmodulin to protoplasts revealed 117- and 41-kDa plasma membrane proteins specifically bound to calmodulin, whereas cross-linking with intact suspension-cultured cells verified more calmodulin binding proteins which might be cell wall-associated in addition to membrane-localized. Taking together, our data provide first evidence for the presence of apoplastic calmodulin receptor-like binding proteins on the cell surface of Arabidopsis suspension-cultured cells, which strongly supports our previous idea that apoplastic calmodulin functions as a peptide signal involved in regulation of cell growth and development.

Here, we examined the developmental regulation of 5-HT receptors controlling the excitability of pyramidal neurons of this region. Using whole-cell recordings in in vitro brain slices, we identified a dramatic shift in the effects of 5-HT on membrane potential during the postnatal developmental period. In slices derived from young animals [ postnatal day (P) 6 to P19], administration of 5-HT elicits a robust depolarization of layer V pyramidal neurons, which gradually shifts to a hyperpolarization commencing during the third postnatal week. This progression is the result of coordinated changes in the function of 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptors, which mediate different aspects of the depolarization, and of 5-HT1A receptors, which signal the late developing hyperpolarization. The loss of the 5-HT7 receptor-mediated depolarization and the appearance of the 5-HT1A receptor-mediated hyperpolarization appears to reflect changes in receptor expression. In contrast, the decline in the 5-HT2A receptor depolarization with increasing age was associated with changes in the effectiveness with which these receptors could elicit a membrane depolarization, rather than loss of the receptors per se. Together, these results outline coordinated changes in the serotonergic regulation of cortical excitability at a time of extensive synaptic development and thus suggest a key role for these receptor subtypes in the postnatal development of the prefrontal cortex.

Scatchard analysis of [H-3]AT-1015 binding in rabbit cerebral cortex membranes indicated the existence of a single class of binding sites (dissociation constant, K-d=2.18nm). The specific binding of [H-3]AT-1015 increased slowly with time and the association rate constant of [H-3]AT-1015 binding (k(1) = 0.1229 min(-1) nm(-1)) was two times slower than that of [H-3]ketanserin binding (k(1) = 0.2451 min(-1) nm(-1)). The dissociation rate constant of [H-3]AT-1015 binding (t1/2 = 37.03 min) was six times slower than that of [H-3]ketanserin binding (t1/2 = 6.29 min), when the addition of excess unlabelled ligands were AT-1015 and ketanserin, respectively. The dissociation rate constant of [H-3]AT-1015 was slowed to a greater degree (t1/2 = 163.40 min and t1/2 = 198.12 min) by the addition of ketanserin and sarpogrelate as excess unlabelled ligands than was that of [H-3]ketanserin (t1/2 = 17.76 min and t1/2 = 18.45 min) by the addition of AT-1015 and sarpogrelate as an excess unlabelled ligand, respectively. These findings on the dissociation kinetics of [H-3]AT-1015 have confirmed and supported previously reported evidence of the slower dissociation of AT-1015 from 5-HT2 receptors.

We used positron emission tomography (PET) to study the effects of alfentanil (mu L-opioid receptor agonist) on striatal dopamine D2 receptor binding in eight healthy male volunteers. D2 receptor binding was determined by using [C-11]raclopride as radioligand. Each subject underwent two PET sessions on the same day, the first without the drug (control) and the second during alfentanil infusion. Alfentanil was administered as target-controlled infusion to maintain pseudo steady-state plasma concentration of 80 ng/ml throughout the PET session. A freeze lesion model was used for pain testing at the end of both PET sessions. A mechanical pain stimulus of 5 N was rated by the subjects using a visual analog scale. Regions of interest for the putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebellum were drawn on MRI images and transferred to PET images. Alfentanil increased the binding potential of [C-11]raclopride in the putamen by 6.0% (P = 0.04) and in the caudate nucleus by 7.4% (P = 0.008). Alfentanil caused a small reduction in respiratory rate (P = 0.046) and oxygen saturation (P < 0.001), and a moderate consistent increase in end-tidal CO2 (P < 0.001). Pain scores were significantly smaller after alfentanil PET scan (median VAS 9 (0-42) vs. 23.5 (15-52), P = 0.008). These results indicate that pharmacologically relevant concentrations of alfentanil increase D2 dopamine receptor binding in the striatum in man. This increase is assumed to reflect reduced dopamine release. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Our aim in the present study was to determine whether B. burgdorferi is able to interfere with complement (C) at the level of C3 by accelerating C3b inactivation and thus to inhibit the amplification of the C cascade. Strains belonging to different genospecies (Borrelia garinii, B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, and Borrelia afzelii) were compared for their sensitivities to normal human serum and abilities to promote factor I-mediated C3b degradation. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto and B. afzelii strains were found to be serum resistant. When the spirochetes were incubated with radiolabeled C3b, factor I-mediated degradation of C3b was observed in the presence of C-resistant B. afzelii (n = 3) and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto (n = 1) strains but not in the presence of C-sensitive B. garinii (n = 7) strains or control bacteria (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis). Immunoblotting and radioligand binding analyses showed that the C-resistant strains had the capacity to acquire the C inhibitors factor H and factor H-like protein 1 (FHL-1) from growth medium and human serum. A novel surface protein with an apparent molecular mass of 35 kDa was found to preferentially bind to the N terminus region of factor H. Thus, the serum-resistant B. burgdorferi s.l. strains can circumvent C attack by binding the C inhibitors factor H and FHL-1 to their surfaces and promoting factor I-mediated C3b degradation.

To determine whether changes in the cannabinoid system were present in the brains of subjects with schizophrenia, we used in situ radioligand binding and autoradiography to measure the binding of [H-3]CP-55940 to the cannabinoid-1 receptor in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 9), caudate-putamen and areas of the temporal lobe from schizophrenic and control subjects, some of whom had ingested cannabis close to death. There was an increase in the density of [H-3]CP-55940 binding to cannabinoid-1 receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from subjects with schizophrenia (mean +/- S.E.M.: 142 +/- 9.9 vs 119 +/- 6.6 fmol/mg estimated tissue equivalents: P < 0.05) that was independent of recent cannabis ingestion. There was an increase in the density of cannabinoid-1 receptors in the caudate-putamen from subjects who had recently ingested cannabis (151 +/- 9.0 vs 123 +/- 7.2 fmol/mg estimated tissue equivalents: P < 0.05) that was independent of diagnoses. These data indicate that there are changes in cannabinoid-1 receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex that may prove to he associated with the pathology of schizophrenia. By contrast. changes in the density of cannabinoid-1 receptors may occur in the caudate-putamen in response to cannabis ingestion. (C) 2001 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

It may be possible to avoid these undesired actions by use of partial agonists. We determined the effects of CVT-2759, a potential partial agonist of A(1)-ADORs, on guinea pig hearts. CVT-2759 (0.1-100 muM) increased the S-H interval of the isolated heart from 45 +/- 1 to 60 +/- 3 ms (P< 0.01) with a half-maximal effect at 3.1 <mu>M. CVT-2759 did not cause second-degree AV block. CVT-2759 significantly attenuated the actions of the full agonists N-6-cyclopentyladenosine and adenosine. CVT-2759 caused a moderate slowing of atrial rate by less than or equal to 13% and did not shorten the durations of either the atrial or the ventricular monophasic action potential. Coronary conductance was increased by CVT-2759 only at concentrations >10 muM. In contrast, CVT-2759 was a full agonist to decrease cAMP content of rat adipocytes and Fischer rat thyroid line 5 cells. Results of radioligand binding assays indicated that CVT-2759 stabilized a high-affinity, G protein-coupled state of the A(1)-ADOR in membranes prepared from rat adipocytes but not in membranes prepared from the guinea pig brain. The results suggest that a weak A(1)-ADOR agonist, such as CVT-2759, may be useful to slow AV nodal conduction and thereby ventricular rate without causing AV block, bradycardia, atrial arrhythmias, or vasodilation.

J	Erikson, KM; Jones, BC; Beard, JL				Erikson, KM; Jones, BC; Beard, JL			Iron deficiency alters dopamine transporter functioning in rat striatum	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						iron deficiency anemia; rat brain; dopamine; cocaine; dopamine transporter	BRAIN IRON; IN-VIVO; TRANSFERRIN; METABOLISM; FERRITIN; REVERSAL; BEHAVIOR; INFANTS; MODEL	Iron deficiency anemia in early life produces profound changes in both in vivo and in vitro evaluations of dopamine (DA) functioning. This study employed both behavioral and biochemical approaches to examine the biological bases of alterations in striatal DA metabolism seen in iron-deficient rats. The purpose was to determine whether the DA transporter (DAT) was functionally altered in postweaning iron deficiency. Male and female 21-d-old Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 40) were fed either an iron-deficient (ID) diet (3 mg Fe/kg diet) or a control (CN) diet (35 mg Fe/kg diet) for 4 wk before behavioral testing. Motor activity responses to graded doses (3.75-30 mg/kg body) of the DA uptake inhibitor, cocaine, were significantly blunted in iron-deficient rats with a 50% higher half-maximal effective dose (ED50) in both males and females (CN-female, 7.1 +/- 0.9 mg/kg; ID-female, 11.2 +/- 1.3 mg/kg; CN-male, 12.0 +/- 0.7 mg/kg; and ID-male, 17.0 +/- 1.8 mg/kg). Radioligand binding assays with H-3-1-(2- (diphenylmethoxy)-ethyl)-4-(3-phenylpropyl) piperazine (H-3-GBR12935) demonstrated that iron deficiency did not alter the affinity of the ligand for the DAT but did significantly decrease the density of the transporter by 30% in caudate putamen and 20% in nucleus accumbens. Iron deficiency also significantly decreased H-3-DA uptake into striatal synaptosomes, but did not affect release of DA with potassium chloride stimulation. These experiments provide supporting evidence that elevated levels of extracellular DA in the striatum of iron-deficient rats is likely to be the result of decreased DAT functioning and not increased rates of release.

Both tetrapeptides activated G proteins and inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity in membrane preparations from cells stably expressing the mu opioid receptor, an effect reversed by the mu receptor antagonist CTAP (d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH2), but they had no influence on cells stably expressing the delta opioid receptor. To further establish the selectivity of these peptides for the mu opioid receptor, brain preparations of mice lacking the mu opioid receptor gene were used to study their binding and signalling properties. Endomorphin 2, tritiated by a dehalotritiation method resulting in a specific radioactivity of 1.98 TBq/mmol (53.4 Ci/mmol), labelled the brain membranes of wild-type mice with a K-d value of 1.77 nm and a B-max of 63.33 fmol/mg protein. In membranes of mice lacking the mu receptor gene, no binding was observed, and both endomorphins failed to stimulate [S-35]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate ([S-35]GTP gamma S) binding and to inhibit adenylyl cyclase. These data show that endomorphins are capable of activating G proteins and inhibiting adenylyl cyclase activity, and all these effects are mediated by the mu opioid receptors.

Modern nuclear medicine in advanced renal cell carcinoma	ONKOLOGIE			English	Article						Metastasis; Kidney neoplasms; Positron emission computed tomography computed tomography; Theranostics; Radioactive tracers	MEMBRANE ANTIGEN; PET/CT; SCINTIGRAPHY; METASTASES; EXPRESSION; GA-68	Background: The prognosis of localized renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is favorable; however, in 25-30% of patients the cancer has already metastasized at initial diagnosis and an additional 20-30% will develop metastatic spread. Treatment mainly depends on the patient's condition, tumor stage, and the patient's wish. Accordingly, choosing an adequate imaging modality is crucial in order to select the best possible treatment and to evaluate treatment response. Objectives: The aim of this review is to identify available positron emission tomography (PET) methods and other imaging modalities in the field of nuclear medicine for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) and their implication on staging and therapy. Materials andmethods: A structured search in PubMed was performed and guidelines were selectively assessed. Patient examples fromour hospital are added. Results: 99mTc-Sestamibi single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) or 123I-meta-iodobenzylguanadine (MIBG) scintigraphy can be performed to evaluate renal lesions. In the context of PET/CT, the use of different tracers, such as 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), 68Ga-prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)/18F-PSMA, 68Ga-fibroblast-activation protein inhibitor (FAPI)/18F- FAPI, somatostatin receptor addressing radioligands and radioligands targeting the tyrosine kinase c-Met, is possible, depending on the specific question and tracer availability. The tracers address different target structures of the tumor cell and the tumor microenvironment and can be used in a complementary manner. The potential use of these ligands in the context of radioligand therapy is conceivable. Conclusions: Patients with mRCC benefit from the use of novel tracers in PET/CT, as they support individualized therapy decisions.

Participation of Brain Receptors in the Mechanism of Anticonvulsant Action of the New 4-Benzoylpyridine Oxime Derivative GIZH-298	NEUROCHEMICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						epilepsy; GIZH-298; 4-benzoylpyridine oxime derivatives; maximum electroshock; D-2 receptors; radioligand method; receptor binding	METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; HIPPOCAMPAL AMPA; DOPAMINE; EPILEPSY; BINDING; INHIBITION; EXCITATION; SEROTONIN; LIGAND; PRONE	The aim of this work was to study the involvement of the glutamate, dopamine, and serotonin receptors in the mechanism of the anticonvulsant action of the 4-benzoylpyridine oxime derivative (GIZH-298). After a single corneal exposure to the maximum electric shock (MES) and subsequent tonic-clonic seizures, an increase in the density (Bmax) of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus by 27% and a decrease in the number of mGluII receptors (mGluR2/ 3) by 25% in the prefrontal cortex of the brain of rats were noted. At the same time, the number of 5-HT2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex did not change. GIZH-298 (60 mg/kg) with a single application inhibits convulsive reactions but does not affect the quantitative changes induced by MES in glutamate receptors and does not affect them under normal conditions without MES. In tests on mice, subchronic (5 days) corneal exposure to MES reduced the density (Bmax) of D-2 receptors in the striatum by 17% and did not change this parameter in the prefrontal cortex. GIZH-298 (60 mg/kg/5 days) eliminates clonic-tonic convulsions in mice and prevents a decrease in the number of D-2 receptors from striatal membranes and also increases their number by 13% in mice without MES in the same structure. The data we obtained indicate significant changes in the functional activity of the NMDA, mGluII, and D-2 receptors in the brains of animals that suffered seizures. The anticonvulsant effects of GIZH-298 are accompanied by the restoration of the number of D-2 receptors in the striatum.	[Litvinova, S. A.; Kondrakhin, E. V.; Voronina, T. A.; Vasil'eva, E.

Mounting evidence supports their activation in the brain during epilepsy, and inhibition of the P2X7 receptor reduces the seizure frequency and severity. In this study, we investigate P2X7R-targeted (18F-FTTM) position emission tomography (PET) imaging in a rat model of temporal lobe epilepsy to obtain further insights into the role of P2X7R during epileptogenesis. 18F-FTTM (5-10% radiochemical yield, over 99% radiochemical purity, and a specific activity of 270-300 MBq/nmol, n = 6, EOS) was first synthesized. Then, the rat models induced by intrahippocampal injection of saline (1.2 mu L, n = 15) or kainic acid (1.2 mu L, 0.5 mu g/mu L, n = 35) were examined using 18F-FTTM Micro-PET/CT longitudinal imaging, respectively. The imaging results showed that increases in the 18F-FTTM uptake was evident after status epilepticus (SE) in the epileptogenesis-associated brain regions, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, or temporal cortex, and this peaked during the latent period. The histopathological analysis revealed that the P2X7R PET uptake reached a peak at 7 days after SE and was mostly related to microglial activation. Thus, P2X7R-targeted PET imaging agent 18F-FTTM may act as a useful tool for identifying brain inflammation during epilepsy. P2X7R PET is a highly potent longitudinal biomarker of epilepsy and could be of interest to determine the therapeutic windows in epilepsy and to monitor treatment response, and it warrants further clinical studies.

The molecular mechanisms of this perception are not fully understood, notably those of lipo-chitooligosaccharides (LCOs) produced during root endosymbioses with nitrogen-fixing bacteria or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In Medicago truncatula, we previously identified the LysM-RLK LYR3 (MtLYR3) as a specific LCO-binding protein. We also showed that the absence of LCO binding to LYR3 of the non-mycorrhizal Lupinus angustifolius, (LanLYR3), was related to LysM3, which differs from that of MtLYR3 by several amino acids and, particularly, by a critical tyrosine residue absent in LanLYR3. Here, we aimed to define the LCO binding site of MtLYR3 by using molecular modelling and simulation approaches, combined with site-directed mutagenesis and LCO binding experiments. 3D models of MtLYR3 and LanLYR3 ectodomains were built, and homology modelling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed. Molecular docking and MD simulation on the LysM3 identified potential key residues for LCO binding. We highlighted by steered MD simulations that in addition to the critical tyrosine, two other residues were important for LCO binding in MtLYR3. Substitution of these residues in LanLYR3-LysM3 by those of MtLYR3-LysM3 allowed the recovery of high-affinity LCO binding in experimental radioligand-binding assays. An analysis of selective constraints revealed that the critical tyrosine has experienced positive selection pressure and is absent in some LYR3 proteins. These findings now pave the way to uncover the functional significance of this specific evolutionary pattern.

Thus, scientists worldwide are researching to develop non-ER binding starting compounds to fulfill unmet market needs. In line with this trending research topic, the current paper highlights the development of tetrazole derivatives bearing a bisphenol structure (TbB) as a novel weak binder or potential inactive to the estrogen receptor (ER) and androgen receptor (AR). The structure and ligand-based approach supported by binding affinity analysis, electrostatic complementarity, ADMET prediction, and in silico studies identified TbBs as privileged substitutes for BPA. Five TbB ligands were successfully synthesized and subjected to biological testing comprising radioligand competitive binding and functional cellular assays. The measured IC50 value for BPA was found to be 0.24 mu M, whereas all the inhibitions were less than 15% for the two TbB ligands, 223-2 and 223-3. As these TbB ligands did not meet the established acceptance criteria of 50% inhibition, they are considered as extremely weak binders to ER alpha. Steric clashes, the desolvation effect, and the increased total polar surface area (TPSA) of TbB ligands in the hydrophobic binding site are hypothesized to be possible reasons for low binding. Modeling studies complemented by bioassays highlight TbB compounds as privileged prospective BPA replacements. However, more research on TbB ligand toxicity is needed to understand and substantiate that the adverse effects on the hormonal system, for example, via metabolic activation, are not elicited.

Impact of Androgen Receptor Activity on Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen Expression in Prostate Cancer Cells	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						FOLH1; AR; PCa; antiandrogen; androgen deprivation therapy	PSMA EXPRESSION; UP-REGULATION; THERAPY; GENE; TUMOR; TRANSCRIPTION; INDEPENDENCE; PROGRESSION; INHIBITION; ENHANCER	Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is an essential molecular regulator of prostate cancer (PCa) progression coded by the FOLH1 gene. The PSMA protein has become an important factor in metastatic PCa diagnosis and radioligand therapy. However, low PSMA expression is suggested to be a resistance mechanism to PSMA-based imaging and therapy. Clinical studies revealed that androgen receptor (AR) inhibition increases PSMA expression. The mechanism has not yet been elucidated. Therefore, this study investigated the effect of activation and inhibition of androgen signaling on PSMA expression levels in vitro and compared these findings with PSMA levels in PCa patients receiving systemic therapy. To this end, LAPC4, LNCaP, and C4-2 PCa cells were treated with various concentrations of the synthetic androgen R1881 and antiandrogens. Changes in FOLH1 mRNA were determined using qPCR. Open access databases were used for ChIP-Seq and tissue expression analysis. Changes in PSMA protein were determined using western blot. For PSMA staining in patients' specimens, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed. Results revealed that treatment with the synthetic androgen R1881 led to decreased FOLH1 mRNA and PSMA protein. This effect was partially reversed by antiandrogen treatment. However, AR ChIP-Seq analysis revealed no canonical AR binding sites in the regulatory elements of the FOLH1 gene. IHC analysis indicated that androgen deprivation only resulted in increased PSMA expression in patients with low PSMA levels. The data demonstrate that AR activation and inhibition affects PSMA protein levels via a possible non-canonical mechanism. Moreover, analysis of PCa tissue reveals that low PSMA expression rates may be mandatory to increase PSMA by androgen deprivation.

JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PATHOLOGY TOXICOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY			English	Article						VEGF; STAT3; PSMA; malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor; malignant melanoma; glioblastoma	ENDOTHELIAL GROWTH-FACTOR; SIGNAL TRANSDUCER; ANGIOGENESIS; ACTIVATION; PATHWAY	Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs), glioblastomas (GBMs), and malignant melanomas (MMs) are neural crest-originating aggressive tumors with a poor prognosis. Signal transducer and transcription activator 3 (STAT3) plays a role in many biological processes, including cell life and proliferation, the acute phase response, chronic inflammation, autoimmunity, metabolism, and cancer progression, It is also known to be a prooncogenic transcription factor. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent proangiogenic stimuli ever identified. It mediates tumor neovascularization, and is associated with angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) folate hydrolase I, despite its name, has been found in tissues other than the prostate. It is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and several other cancers, and has the potential to be a target for radioligand therapy. We investigated the value of STAT3, VEGF and PSMA immunohistochemical expression patterns and their effects on survival in MPNSTs, GBMs, and MMs. Their expression patterns were evaluated in 25 MPNSTs, 27 GBMs, and 25 MM cases. All GBM cases stained positively for STAT3 and VEGF. In the other groups, the staining patterns were heterogeneous. None of the cases showed positive staining with PSMA. There was no statistically significant difference in survival between cases with differing VEGF and STAT3 staining patterns in the MPSNT and MM groups, but there was an increase in mortality as the VEGF score increased in the GBM group. The suppression of VEGF and STAT3 may be a promising avenue for treatment of MPNSTs, GBMs, and MMs, although further research is needed.

We present our preliminary results on the use of Ac-225-PSMA therapy in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer as a single center. Methods Twelve advanced stage metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer patients who received Ac-225-PSMA therapy were recruited in this retrospective study. Patients were treated with Ac-225-PSMA therapy every 8 weeks, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response was analyzed. Meanwhile, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated. Hematological and nonhematological adverse effects were recorded before and at 8 weeks after the last treatment cycle. Results In total, 25 cycles of Ac-225-PSMA were administered to 12 patients. The pretreatment median PSA level was 129 ng/mL. After the first cycle of therapy, any PSA response was observed in 9 of 12 patients, whereas 6 of them had biochemical response of >50%. Four of 12 patients reached the best PSA response after the first treatment cycle, whereas 3 patients after the second and 2 patients after the third cycle. The median PFS and OS were 4 and 10 months, respectively. For patients with any PSA response after the first cycle, OS was found to be higher despite without any statistical significance (10 vs 4 months; P = 0.301) when compared with the nonresponsive group. No significant difference was encountered in terms of adverse effect in the pretreatment and posttreatment era. Conclusions Our preliminary results are encouraging, especially patients who had PSA response after the first cycle of Ac-225-PSMA therapy.

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [F-18]FPEB allows assessing dynamic changes in metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) availability underlying neuropathological conditions. The influence of endogenous glutamatergic levels into receptor binding has not been well established yet. The purpose of this study was to explore the [F-18]FPEB binding regarding to physiological fluctuations or acute changes of glutamate synaptic concentrations by a translational approach; a PET/MRS imaging study in 12 healthy human volunteers combined to a PET imaging after an N-acetylcysteine (NAc) pharmacological challenge in rodents. No significant differences were observed with small-animal PET in the test and retest conditions on the one hand and the NAc condition on the other hand for any regions. To test for an interaction of mGuR5 density and glutamatergic concentrations in healthy subjects, we correlated the [F-18]FPEB BPND with Glu/Cr, Gln/Cr, Glx/Cr ratios in the anterior cingulate cortex VOI; respectively, no significance correlation has been revealed (Glu/Cr: r = 0.51, p = 0.09; Gln/Cr: r = -0.46, p = 0.13; Glx/Cr: r = -0.035, p = 0.92).These data suggest that the in vivo binding of [F-18]FPEB to an allosteric site of the mGluR5 is not modulated by endogenous glutamate in vivo. Thus, [F-18]FPEB appears unable to measure acute fluctuations in endogenous levels of glutamate.

The present study evaluated the influence of the Phe residues' stereochemistry on the peptides' opioid activity. Five stereoisomers were synthesized by a combination of solid-phase peptide synthesis and cyclization in solution. The analogs were evaluated in vitro for opioid receptor affinity in radioligand competition binding assays, and for opioid activity and selectivity in vivo in the mouse 55 degrees C warm-water tail-withdrawal assay. Potential liabilities of locomotor impairment, respiratory depression, acute tolerance development, and place conditioning were also assessed in vivo. All of the stereoisomers exhibited antinociception following either intracerebroventricular or oral administration differentially mediated by multiple opioid receptors, with kappa opioid receptor (KOR) activity contributing for all of the peptides. However, unlike the parent peptides, KOR antagonism was exhibited by only one stereoisomer, while another isomer produced DOR antagonism. The stereoisomers of CJ-15,208 lacked significant respiratory effects, while the [d-Trp]CJ-15,208 stereoisomers did not elicit antinociceptive tolerance. Two isomers,cyclo[d-Phe-d-Pro-d-Phe-Trp] (3) andcyclo[Phe-d-Pro-d-Phe-d-Trp] (5), did not elicit either preference or aversion in a conditioned place preference assay. Collectively, these stereoisomers represent new lead compounds for further investigation in the development of safer opioid analgesics.

Neuroinflammation as measured by positron emission tomography in patients with recent onset and established schizophrenia: implications for immune pathogenesis	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ULTRA-HIGH RISK; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MICROGLIAL ACTIVITY; 1ST-EPISODE PSYCHOSIS; 18 KDA; BRAIN; ACTIVATION; EXPRESSION; INFLAMMATION; PEOPLE	Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which is upregulated in activated microglia, is a method for investigating whether immune activation is evident in the brain of adults with schizophrenia. This study aimed to measure TSPO availability in the largest patient group to date, and to compare it between patients with recent onset (ROS) and established (ES) schizophrenia. In total, 20 ROS patients (14 male), 21 ES (13 male), and 21 healthy controls completed the study. Patients were predominantly antipsychotic-medicated. Participants underwent a PET scan using the TSPO-specific radioligand [C-11](R)-PK11195. The primary outcome was binding potential (BPND) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Secondary outcomes were BP(ND)in six other regions. Correlations were investigated between TSPO availability and symptom severity. Data showed that mean BP(ND)was higher in older (ES and controls) compared with younger (ROS and controls) individuals, but did not significantly differ between ROS or ES and their respective age-matched controls (ACC; ANOVA main effect of diagnosis:F-1,F-58 = 0.407,p = 0.526). Compared with controls, BP(ND)was lower in antipsychotic-free (n = 6), but not in medicated, ROS patients. BP(ND)in the ES group was negatively correlated with positive symptoms, and positively correlated with negative symptom score. Our data suggest ageing is associated with higher TSPO but a diagnosis of schizophrenia is not. Rather, subnormal TSPO levels in drug-free recent-onset patients may imply impaired microglial development and/or function, which is counteracted by antipsychotic treatment. The development of novel radioligands for specific immune-mechanisms is needed for further clarification.

Theranostics: Leveraging Molecular Imaging and Therapy to Impact Patient Management and Secure the Future of Nuclear Medicine	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						SSTR; PSMA; Lu-177; I-131; endoradiotherapy	RECEPTOR RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY; ENETS CONSENSUS GUIDELINES; RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; NEUROENDOCRINE NEOPLASMS; PHASE-II; CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR; CXCR4-DIRECTED ENDORADIOTHERAPY; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; EMITTING RA-223; BONE METASTASES	Nuclear medicine is experiencing a renaissance, with U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval recently being obtained for theranostic agents and a wide variety of such agents soon to impact patient care significantly in the era of precision medicine. The NETTER-1 trial demonstrated the therapeutic effect of a theranostic agent in markedly improving progression-free survival in patients with metastatic gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Predominantly retrospective studies have demonstrated a significant response to Lu-177-labeled agents targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in patients with prostate cancer. At least 2 prospective clinical trials involving Lu-177-PSMA agents are under way that will likely pave the way for Food and Drug Administration approval in the United States. A significant upside to theranostics is that patients tend to tolerate these agents better than chemotherapy. Theranostic compounds are likely to impact many cancers in the near future, not only through improvements in quality of life but also in terms of survival. This article provides an overview of already approved agents as well as those on the horizon. It is important that as these agents are clinically onboarded, nuclear medicine physicians have the expertise to deploy theranostics safely and efficiently, ensuring that these agents attain and maintain their position as leading lines of therapy in managing patients with cancer as well as becoming an important aspect of nuclear medicine practice in the future.

We hypothesized that PET could be used to visualize the binding of the bronchodilator drug ipratropium to muscarinic receptors (MR) in the lungs of living non-human primates (NHP). The objectives of this study were two-fold: (i) to develop a methodology for quantitative imaging of muscarinic receptors in NHP lung and (ii) to estimate and compare ipratropium-induced MR occupancy following drug administration via intravenous injection and inhalation, respectively.MethodsA series of PET measurements (n=18) was performed after intravenous injection of the selective muscarinic radioligand C-11-VC-002 in NHP (n=5). The lungs and pituitary gland (both rich in MR) were kept in the field of view. Each PET measurement was followed by a PET measurement preceded by treatment with ipratropium (intravenous or inhaled).ResultsRadioligand binding was quantified using the Logan graphical analysis method providing the total volume of distribution (V-T). Ipratropium reduced the V-T in the lung and pituitary in a dose-dependent fashion. At similar plasma ipratropium concentrations, administration by inhalation produced larger reductions in V-T for the lungs. The plasma-derived apparent affinity for ipratropium binding in the lung was one order of magnitude higher after inhalation (K-iih=1.01nM) than after intravenous infusion (K-iiv=10.84nM).ConclusionQuantitative muscarinic receptor occupancy imaging by PET articulates and quantifies the therapeutic advantage of the inhaled route of delivery and provides a tool for future developments of improved inhaled drugs.

NEUROLOGIA I NEUROCHIRURGIA POLSKA			English	Article						SPECT-DaTSCAN; referrals; non-movement disorders specialists; movement disorders specialists	PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; IDIOPATHIC PARKINSONS-DISEASE; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; CLINICAL-DIAGNOSIS; TASK-FORCE; BRAIN; CRITERIA	Background. SPECT with radioligand DaTSCAN (SPECT-DaTSCAN) is a sensitive tool used for assessing the functional integrity of the presynaptic part of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system. The procedure is useful whenever there is a need to distinguish between neurodegenerative parkinsonism and other parkinsonian syndromes in subjects with equivocal signs and symptoms. It can be assumed that the neurologist's decision to perform SPECT-DaTSCAN depends on his or her experience and skill in the diagnosis of parkinsonian and tremor syndromes. Aims. To assess the accuracy of referrals to SPECT-DATSCAN made by non-movement disorders specialists. Material and methods. Sixty seven patients referred for SPECT-DaTSCAN by a general neurologist were studied. In all subjects, a movement disorder specialist performed the neurological examination, collected medical history, and analysed previous treatments and the results of diagnostic tests. Results. Evaluation carried out by a movement disorder specialist did not confirm an indication for SPECT-DaTSCAN in 31 patients (46.3%). General neurologists needed support for clinical diagnosis with SPECT-DaTSCAN most frequently in subjects with parkinsonism even though they were presenting a full-blown disease manifestation and even though the patients met the diagnostic criteria for Parkinson's disease or one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Conclusions. Our presented results probably reflect the limited experience of general neurologists in the evaluation of parkinsonian syndromes and tremor. The use of SPECT-DaTSCAN by non-movement disorders specialists is associated with a significant risk of overuse of this tool. To minimise this risk, the skills of general neurologists in diagnosing parkinsonian and tremor syndromes should be improved. Moreover, patients should be provided with access to movement disorders specialists.

Comparability and physiological relevance of in vitro metabolism data critically depend on the careful evaluation and optimization of assay protocols. We therefore investigated the influence of incubation conditions on the microsomal stability of xanthine-derived A1 adenosine receptor (A1AR) ligands which have been developed for positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: Substrate depletion assays using rat liver microsomes (RLM) were performed for three analogous compounds which differ with regard to the metabolically vulnerable substituent at the xanthine C8 position. Incubation conditions were varied systematically. Additionally, the stability of the cofactor NADPH during incubation was investigated. Results: Microsomal metabolism was strongly influenced by buffer pH, organic solvents and preincubation time. Substrate depletion values varied up to 5-fold depending on incubation matrix composition, however, the rank order of metabolic stability remained unchanged. Prolonged incubation periods led to drastic loss in enzyme activity which could not be prevented by addition of metal chelators or antioxidants. Cofactor NADPH was rapidly oxidized in microsomal matrix, even in the absence of cytochrome P450 substrates. Discussion: In summary, short incubation times, precise pH control and minimal concentrations of organic solvents are mandatory to obtain reliable microsomal stability data. Furthermore, in vitro metabolic stability of the tested A1AR ligands varied largely depending on the particular C8 substituent. Consequently, structural modifications at the xanthine C8 position appear to be a promising strategy for the improvement of A1AR PET radioligands.

In this connection, we recently developed the fluorine-18-labelled PSMA-ligand [F-18]PSMA-1007 as the next generation radiofluorinated Glu-ureido PSMA inhibitor after [F-18]DCFPyL and [F-18]DCFBC. Since radiosynthesis so far has been suffering from rather poor yields, novel procedures for the automated radiosyntheses of [F-18]PSMA-1007 have been developed. We herein report on both the two-step and the novel one-step procedures, which have been performed on different commonly-used radiosynthesisers. Using the novel one-step procedure, the [F-18]PSMA-1007 was produced in good radiochemical yields ranging from 25 to 80% and synthesis times of less than 55 min. Furthermore, upscaling to product activities up to 50 GBq per batch was successfully conducted. All batches passed quality control according to European Pharmacopoeia standards. Therefore, we were able to disclose a new, simple and, at the same time, high yielding production pathway for the next generation PSMA radioligand [F-18]PSMA-1007. Actually, it turned out that the radiosynthesis is as easily realised as the well-known [F-18]FDG synthesis and, thus, transferable to all currently-available radiosynthesisers. Using the new procedures, the clinical daily routine can be sustainably supported in-house even in larger hospitals by a single production batch.

Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a sham operation group, a model group, and three AST treatment groups. Cerebral ischemic models were induced by the clue-blocked method. Neurological deficits were examined. The animals were sacrificed after 2 h of ischemia and 24 h of reperfusion, and mitochondria from the penumbra were purified. PBR density (B-max) and affinity were measured by radioligand assays. Mitochondrial [3H] PK11195 binding was correlated with neurological deficits in rats. Compared to the model group, the 10 mg/kg AST group, 40 mg/kg AST group, and 100 mg/kg AST group had fewer neurological deficits. The effects in the 40 mg/ kg group did not significantly differ from the effects in the 100 mg/ kg group. Compared to the model group, the 10 mg/kg AST group, 40 mg/kg group, and 100 mg/kg group had a decreased B-max in the penumbra. The B-max decreased in the 40 mg/kg AST group and in the 100 mg/kg AST group compared with the 10 mg/kg group. The Bmax and neurological deficits in the 40 mg/kg did not significantly differ from those in the 100 mg/kg group. By contrast, the AST-treated rats showed no significant changes in the binding parameter equilibrium dissociation constant compared with those in the sham operation group and the model group.

The apelin receptor inhibits the angiotensin II type 1 receptor via allosteric trans-inhibition	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						GPCR; APJ receptor; AT1 receptor; heterodimerization; apelin; angiotensin II; allosterism	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; OPIOID RECEPTORS; BETA(2)-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; HETERODIMERIZATION; SOMATOSTATIN; OLIGOMERIZATION; SUBTYPES; DOPAMINE; ROLES; APJ	Background and Purpose The apelin receptor (APJ) is often co-expressed with the angiotensin II type-1 receptor (AT1) and acts as an endogenous counter-regulator. Apelin antagonizes Ang II signalling, but the precise molecular mechanism has not been elucidated. Understanding this interaction may lead to new therapies for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Experimental Approach The physical interaction of APJ and AT1 receptors was detected by co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Functional and pharmacological interactions were measured by G-protein-dependent signalling and recruitment of -arrestin. Allosterism and cooperativity between APJ and AT1 were measured by radioligand binding assays. Key Results Apelin, but not Ang II, induced APJ:AT1 heterodimerization forced AT1 into a low-affinity state, reducing Ang II binding. Likewise, apelin mediated a concentration-dependent depression in the maximal production of inositol phosphate (IP1) and -arrestin recruitment to AT1 in response to Ang II. The signal depression approached a limit, the magnitude of which was governed by the cooperativity indicative of a negative allosteric interaction. Fitting the data to an operational model of allosterism revealed that apelin-mediated heterodimerization significantly reduces Ang II signalling efficacy. These effects were not observed in the absence of apelin. Conclusions and Implications Apelin-dependent heterodimerization between APJ and AT1 causes negative allosteric regulation of AT1 function. As AT1 is significant in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease, these findings suggest that impaired apelin and APJ function may be a common underlying aetiology.

Relationship of Dopamine Type 2 Receptor Binding Potential With Fasting Neuroendocrine Hormones and Insulin Sensitivity in Human Obesity	DIABETES CARE			English	Article							NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FOOD-INTAKE; IN-VIVO; GHRELIN; LEPTIN; REWARD; INCREASES; RESPONSES; STRIATUM	OBJECTIVE-Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, which are involved with reward and motivation, are modulated by hormones that regulate food intake (insulin, leptin, and acyl ghrelin [AG]). We hypothesized that these hormones are associated with deficits in DA signaling in obesity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-We assessed the relationships between fasting levels of insulin and leptin, and AG, BMI, and insulin sensitivity index (S-I) with the availability of central DA type 2 receptor (D2R). We measured D2R availability using positron emission tomography and [F-18] fallypride (radic ligand that competes with endogenous DA) in lean (n = 8) and obese (n = 14) females. Fasting hormones were collected prior to scanning and S-I was determined by modified oral glucose tolerance test. RESULTS-Parametric image analyses revealed associations between each metabolic measure and D2R. The most extensive findings were negative associations of AG with clusters involving the striatum and inferior temporal cortices. Regional regression analyses also found extensive negative relationships between AG and D2R in the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum (VS), amygdala, and temporal lobes. S-I was negatively associated with D2R in the VS, while insulin was not. In the caudate, BMI and leptin were positively associated with D2R availability. The direction of associations of leptin and AG with D2R availability are consistent with their opposite effects on DA levels (decreasing and increasing, respectively). After adjusting for BM I, AG maintained a significant relationship in the VS. We hypothesize that the increased D2R availability in obese subjects reflects relatively reduced DA levels competing with the radioligand. CONCLUSIONS-Our findings provide evidence for an association between the neuroendocrine hormones and DA brain signaling in obese females.

These strategies raise the need for a noninvasive tool to evaluate tumor vasculature. We describe the radiosynthesis and evaluation of an imaging tracer that specifically binds tumor subendothelial collagen and thereby images tumor vasculature. Methods: Tc-99m-tricarbonyl was prepared and labeled with His-collagen-binding adhesion protein 35 (CNA35). After in vitro specificity testing, in vivo biodistribution and dosimetric studies were performed in healthy nude mice via planar imaging. Tc-99m-(CO)(3) His-CNA35 was evaluated for in vivo imaging of tumor vasculature in a HT29 colorectal carcinoma xenograft. Results: The labeling procedure yielded a compound with 95%-99% radiochemical purity and good in vitro stability. An in vitro binding test confirmed specificity and functionality. Tc-99m-(CO)(3) His-CNA35 rapidly cleared from the blood and pre-dominantly accumulated in the kidneys and liver. The effective dose for a proposed single injection of 500 MBq of Tc-99m-(CO)(3) His-CNA35 is 3.70 mSv per organ or 2.01 mSv/g of tissue. Tumors were successfully visualized, and uptake correlated with ex vivo immunohistochemical staining of tumor vasculature. Conclusion: Tc-99m-(CO)(3) His-CNA35 may be a useful radioligand for the in vivo detection of tumor vasculature through subendothelial collagen binding. A noninvasive method of imaging tumor vasculature that could provide a reliable assessment of tumor vasculature would allow evaluation of the effectiveness of commonly used antiangiogenic therapies and determination of their optimal dosing and scheduling.

Most postmortem studies point toward lower cortical serotonin(2A) binding in schizophrenic patients. However, in vivo studies of serotonin(2A) binding report conflicting results, presumably because sample sizes have been small or because schizophrenic patients who were not antipsychotic-naive were included. Furthermore, the relationships between serotonin(2A) binding, psychopathology, and central neurocognitive deficits in schizophrenia are unclear. Objectives: To assess in vivo brain serotonin2A binding potentials in a large sample of antipsychotic-naive schizophrenic patients and matched healthy controls, and to examine possible associations with psychopathology, memory, attention, and executive functions. Design: Case-control study. Setting: University hospital, Denmark. Participants: A sample of 30 first-episode, antipsychoticnaive schizophrenic patients, 23 males and 7 females, and 30 matched healthy control subjects. Interventions: Positron emission tomography with the serotonin(2A)-specific radioligand fluorine 18-labeled altanserin and administration of a neuropsychological test battery. Main Outcome Measures: Binding potential of specific tracer binding, scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, and results of neuropsychological testing. Results: Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower serotonin(2A) binding in the frontal cortex than did control subjects. A significant negative correlation was observed between frontal cortical serotonin(2A) binding and positive psychotic symptoms in the male patients. No correlations were found between cognitive functions and serotonin(2A) binding. Conclusion: The results suggest that frontal cortical serotonin(2A) receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

Age-related expression of adenosine receptors in brain from the senescence-accelerated mouse	EXPERIMENTAL GERONTOLOGY			English	Article						Senescence-accelerated mouse; Adenosine receptors; Aging; Brain; Radioligand binding	ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DEPENDENT CHANGES; GENE-EXPRESSION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; A(1) RECEPTORS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; AMINO-ACIDS; SAMP8 MICE; RAT-BRAIN	Senescence-accelerated mice (SAM) are used as a model of aging and age-associated diseases. SAMP8 are prone strains that show shortened life span and deficits in learning and memory processes, while SAMR1 are strains of accelerated senescence-resistant, long-lived mice. Due to their abnormal APP (amyloid precursor protein) metabolism in brain, SAMP8 may be an Alzheimer-type model. Adenosine receptors are G-protein coupled receptors which are altered in brain from Alzheimer disease (AD) cases. The analysis of adenosine receptors in brain from young (21 days old) and middle-aged (180 days old) SAMP8 as compared with SAMR1 mice revealed differences between these strains associated with age. The age-related increase in mRNA coding A(1) and A(2B) receptors observed in SAMR1 was absent in SAMP8. A(1) receptors were significantly decreased with age in SAMR1, while no differences were observed in SAMP8. However, the levels of A(1) receptors in young SAMP8 were even lower than those obtained in middle-aged SAMR1. In addition, A(2A) receptors were significantly increased only in aged SAMR1. A similar age-related decrease in A(1) receptors level was also observed in brain from male Wistar rats. These results suggest different age-related effects on adenosine receptors in SAMR1 and SAMP8 strains. Since A(1) receptors are mainly neuroprotective, their important loss in very young SAMP8 strain suggests the involvement of these receptors in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging.

This study was designed to compare brain uptake of three radiolabeled P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates across species using positron emission tomography. Brain concentrations and brain-to-plasma ratios were compared; [(11)C]verapamil in rats, guinea pigs, and monkeys; [(11)C](S)-(2-methoxy-5-(5-trifluoromethyltetrazol-1-yl)phenylmethylamino)-2(S)-phenylpiperidine (GR205171) in rats, guinea pigs, monkeys, and humans; and [(18)F]altanserin in rats, minipigs, and humans. The fraction of the unbound radioligand in plasma was studied along with its metabolism. The effect of P-gp inhibition was investigated by administering cyclosporin A (CsA). Pronounced species differences were found in the brain and braintoplasma concentrations of [(11)C]verapamil, [(11)C]GR205171, and [(18)F]altanserin with higher brain distribution in humans, monkeys, and minipigs than in rats and guinea pigs. For example, the braintoplasma ratio of [(11)C]GR205171 was almost 9-fold higher in humans compared with rats. The species differences were still present after P-gp inhibition, although the increase in brain concentrations after P-gp inhibition was somewhat greater in rats than in the other species. Differences in plasma protein binding and metabolism did not explain the species-related differences. The findings are important for interpretation of brain drug delivery when extrapolating preclinical data to humans. Compounds found to be P-gp substrates in rodents are likely to also be substrates in higher species, but sufficient blood-brain barrier permeability may be retained in humans to allow the compound to act at intracerebral targets.

We hypothesized that women have higher density of histamine H1 receptor (H1R) in the limbic system than men and that the density of central HI R is increased in patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). Methods: Subjects were 12 female AN patients, 12 healthy female subjects, and 11 healthy male subjects. Positron emission tomography with H1 R radioligand [C-11]doxepin was performed on all subjects and regions of interest based analysis was conducted to evaluate brain HI R binding potential (BP). Abnormal eating behavior, depression, and anxiety of subjects were evaluated using the Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26), Self-Rating Depression Scale (SIDS), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), respectively. Results: Binding potential of [C-11]doxepin in female subjects was significantly higher than that in male subjects at the following brain sites: amygdala, hippocampus, medial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and temporal cortex. Anorexia nervosa patients showed significantly higher BP of [C-11]doxepin in the amygdala and lentiform nucleus than the control female subjects. In AN patients, BP of [C-11]doxepin in the amygdala and thalamus negatively correlated with EAT-26 scores. There was a significant negative correlation between BP of [C-11]doxepin and SIDS or STAI scores in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex of AN patients. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis that women have higher HI R density in the limbic system than men and suggest that AN patients may have higher expression of H1R in the limbic brain, particularly in the amygdala.

Receptor binding assays (RBAs) with selective radioligands, which are widely used in CNS studies, have not produced consistent results when applied to isolated PBMC. We tested the assay conditions that Could be essential for detection of DR in human PBMC and their membrane preparations. Using [H-3]SCH23390, a dopamine D1-like receptor antagonist, we demonstrated the presence of two binding sites in PBMC-derived membrane fraction. One of them is characterized by the K-d value consistent with that reported for D5 dopamine receptors in human lymphocytes, whereas the other K-d value possibly corresponds to serotonin receptor(s). Although D5 receptor binding sites in PBMC membranes could be characterized by binding assays, the low protein expression and the large volume of blood needed for membrane preparation tender the binding method impracticable for individual phenotyping. in contrast, real-time RT-PCR may be used for this purpose, contingent on the relationship between DR expression in the brain and in lymphocytes. The expression of the DRD2-DRD5 genes, as detected by this method, varied widely among samples, whereas the DRD1 expression was not detected. The expression levels were comparable with those in the brain for DRD3 and DRD4, and were significantly lower for DRD2 and DRD5. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The compounds were examined in binding assays at three subtypes of adenosine receptors (ARs) and in functional assays at the A(3)AR. The H-bonding ability of a group of 9-riboside derivatives containing a 5 '-uronamide moiety was reduced by modi. cation of the NH; however these derivatives did not display the desired activity as selective A(3)AR antagonists, as occurs with 5 '-N,N-dimethyluronamides. However, truncated (N)-methanocarba analogues lacking a 4 '-hydroxymethyl group were highly potent and selective antagonists of the human A(3) AR. The compounds were synthesized from D-ribose using a reductive free radical decarboxylation of a 5 '-carboxy intermediate. A less efficient synthetic approach began with L-ribose, which was similar to the published synthesis of (N)-methanocarba A(3)AR agonists. Compounds 33b-39b (N-6-3-halobenzyl and related arylalkyl derivatives) were potent A(3)AR antagonists with binding K-i values of 0.7-1.4 nM. In a functional assay of [S-35] GTP gamma S binding, 33b (3-iodobenzyl) completely inhibited stimulation by NECA with a K-B of 8.9 nM. Thus, a highly potent and selective series of A(3)AR antagonists has been described. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Benzodiazepines (BZDs), anesthetics, and barbiturates exert their CNS actions by binding to GABA(A) receptors and modulating their function. The structural mechanisms by which BZD binding is transduced to potentiation or inhibition of GABA-induced current ( I-GABA) are essentially unknown. Here, we explored the role of the gamma(2)Q182-R197 region (Loop F/9) in the modulation of IGABA by positive ( flurazepam, zolpidem) and negative [3-carbomethoxy-4-ethyl-6,7-dimethoxy-beta-carboline ( DMCM)] BZD ligands. Each residue was individually mutated to cysteine, coexpressed with wild-type alpha(1) and beta 2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes, and analyzed using two-electrode voltage clamp. Individual mutations differentially affected BZD modulation of IGABA. Mutations affecting positive modulation span the length of this region, whereas gamma(2)W183C at the beginning of Loop F was the only mutation that adversely affected DMCM inhibition. Radioligand binding experiments demonstrate that mutations in this region do not alter BZD binding, indicating that the observed changes in modulation result from changes in BZD efficacy. Flurazepam and zolpidem significantly slowed covalent modification of gamma(2)R197C, whereas DMCM, GABA, and the allosteric modulator pentobarbital had no effects, demonstrating that gamma(2)Loop F is a specific transducer of positive BZD modulator binding. Therefore, gamma(2)Loop F plays a key role in defining BZD efficacy and is part of the allosteric pathway allowing positive BZD modulator-induced structural changes at the BZD binding site to propagate through the protein to the channel domain.

We studied cortical DA D, receptors in nine type I alcoholics (late-onset, binge-drinker), eight type 2 alcoholics (early-onset, antisocial) and 10 controls by using [H-3]SCH23390 as a radioligand in postmortem human whole hemisphere autoradiography. We also evaluated correlations of DA D, receptors between the cortical and subcortical areas and between cortical DA transporters and DA D-2 and D-3 receptors by comparing the present results to our earlier studies. On the average, type 2 alcoholics were younger and had more violent causes of death than type I alcoholics and controls. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups, suggesting that cortical DA D, receptors do not play a major role in alcoholism. However, among type 2 alcoholics, the binding was consistently lower (8.6%22.3%) than among controls, and the effect sizes showed a large effect in the anterior cingulate (0.90) and frontal (0.87) cortices. Interestingly, among type 2 alcoholics, the correlation of DA D, receptors between two ventral rnidbrain structures (substantia nigra and amygdala) and anterior cingulate cortex was significantly negative, whereas in the type I alcoholics and controls, the correlations were significantly positive.

Baseline and receptor-blocking scans were performed with [C-11]PBR01 and [F-18]PBR06 in conjunction with serial measurements of the arterial plasma concentration of parent radiotracer separated from radiometabolite. We used brain and plasma data with compartmental modeling to calculate regional brain distribution volume, which is equal to the ratio at equilibrium of the concentration of radioligand in brain to that of plasma. The distribution volume of [C-11]PBR01 was inaccurately estimated in the baseline scans, possibly because of the short half-life of 11C or the presence of radiometabolite in brain. In contrast, the distribution volume of [18F]PBR06 was stably determined within 200 min of scanning, and nondisplaceable uptake was only similar to 10% of total brain uptake. [18F]PBR06 is promising for use in human because brain activity could be quantified with standard compartmental models and showed higher ratios (similar to 10:1) of specific to nonspecific uptake. A critical factor for human use will be whether the tracer has adequately fast wash out from brain relative to the half-life of the radionuclide to obtain stable values of distribution volume.

No evidence for binding of clozapine, olanzapine and/or haloperidol to selected receptors involved in body weight regulation	PHARMACOGENOMICS JOURNAL			English	Article						antipsychotics; body weight gain; binding profile; neurotransmitter; neurohormones; genetics	ANTIPSYCHOTIC-DRUGS; GAIN; POLYMORPHISM; LEPTIN; GENE; MECHANISMS; ASSOCIATION; AFFINITY; PHARMACOGENETICS; NEUROLEPTICS	The underlying mechanisms of antipsychotic (AP)-induced weight gain are unknown, but both central and peripheral AP target receptors could potentially be involved. This study used radioligand binding assays to compare the binding affinities of clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol for candidate receptors potentially involved in AP-induced weight gain. Selected candidates derived from known pathways involved in body weight regulation included receptors classified as anorexigenic (bombesin receptor subtype 3, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor, cholecystokinin receptor, melanocortin-4 receptor, neurotensin receptor 1) or orexigenic (cannabinoid receptor 1, galanin 1 receptor, melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR), neuropeptide Y1 receptor) as well as receptors involved in physiological actions related to digestion and fluid homeostasis (angiotensin II type 1 receptor, bradykinin B2 receptor, endothelin receptor, neurokinin 1 receptor, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide receptor 1). Clozapine, olanzapine and haloperidol exhibited negligible affinities to all of these receptors except for the MCHR (K-i = 501 nM; haloperidol). With respect to other candidates from (neuro) transmitter systems already suggested to be involved in AP-induced weight gain, the binding profile of olanzapine resembled that of clozapine, with high affinity (K-i < 10 nM) for serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and 5-HT6, muscarinic M1 and histamine H1 receptors. In contrast, the binding profile of haloperidol was substantially different (high affinity only for the dopamine D1 receptor). In conclusion, we have not identified a novel binding site of the two investigated atypical AP that could contribute to the induced weight gain.

Differences have been observed in these responses to different types of stress and a link between hormones and neurotransmitters proposed. We studied the effect of acute noise stress on nociception and the possible changes in the serotonergic and opioidergic systems in young mice of both sexes. Naloxone pretreatment was also investigated. Noise stress was produced by a sound source, nociception was measured by the hot-plate test and binding characteristics were evaluated by a radioligand binding technique using membrane preparation from the total frontal cortex. Acute noise stress provoked an antinociceptive effect, associated with an increase in plasma corticosterone levels, a decrease in the number of 5-HT2 receptors in stressed male and female mice and a decrease in the number of mu receptors in both sexes. The behavioural and biochemical effects were antagonized by 1 mg/kg of naloxone. Acute noise stress behaves like other types of stress on nociception. The opioidergic system seems to be involved in this behaviour but also the serotonergic system may play a role. Sex differences were detected in the number of 5-HT2 and mu receptors between male and female mice not subjected to stress, while the percentage decrease in 5-HT2 and mu receptors did not differ significantly between the two sexes.

Glutamatergic mechanisms activate nitric oxide synthase (NOS), while gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) may inhibit both glutamatergic and nitrergic transmission. Animal studies support a role for NOS in stress. Objectives: We have studied the role of NOS and glucocorticoids, as well as inhibitory and excitatory transmitters, in a putative animal model of PTSD that emphasizes repeated trauma. Methods: Hippocampal NOS activity, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor binding characteristics and GABA levels were studied in Sprague-Dawley rats 21 days after exposure to a stress-stress paradigm, using radiometric analysis, radioligand studies and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis with electrochemical detection, respectively. The NOS isoform involved, and the role of stress-mediated corticosterone release in NOS activation, was verified with the administration of selective iNOS and nNOS inhibitors, aminoguanidine (50 mg/kg/day i.p.) and 7-nitroindazole (12.5 mg/kg/day i.p.), and the steroid synthesis inhibitor, ketoconazole (24 mg/kg/day i.p.), administered for 21 days prior to and during the stress procedure. Results: Stress evoked a sustained increase in NOS activity, but reduced NMDA receptor density and total GABA levels. Aminoguanidine or ketoconazole, but not 7-nitroindazole or saline, blocked stress-induced NOS activation. Conclusions: Stress-restress-mediated glucocorticoid release activates iNOS, followed by a reactive downregulation of hippocampal NMDA receptors and dysregulation of inhibitory GABA pathways. The role of NO in neuronal toxicity, and its regulation by glutamate and GABA has important implications in stress-related hippocampal degeneration.

Additionally, due to the lack of sufficiently subtype-selective drugs or high avidity antibodies, the contribution of each alpha(1)AR subtype to various central functions is currently unclear. Transcription regulation through alpha(1)AR subtypes in the CNS is also unknown. Of interest, transgenic mice that systemically overexpress the alpha(1B)AR show central symptoms that include age-progressive impaired mobility, neurodegeneration and susceptibility to epileptic seizure. To investigate the molecular basis of this phenotype, oligonucleotide microarray studies of whole brains of various ages were carried out to compare gene expression profiles between transgenic and normal brains. The results indicated changes in expression of apoptotic, calcium regulatory, neurodegenerative and genes involved in neurotransmission. Defects in regulation of intracellular calcium are known to play a role in cell death; thus, these genes may provide clues as to the molecular basis of alpha(1B)AR-induced neurodegeneration. Epilepsy is a disorder that can be caused by an imbalance between excitatory (e.g. glutamate) and inhibitory (e.g. GABA) signals. Microarray analysis of transgenic brains showed increased N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and decreased GABA(A), which were confirmed with immunohistochemistry, western blot and radioligand binding studies. The alpha(1B)AR also co-localized with the glutamatergic distribution, suggesting a glutamate imbalance as a molecular rationale for the epileptic seizures.

This study employed positron emission tomography (PET) to assess the extent and duration of DAT receptor occupancy by bupropion and its metabolites under conditions of steady-state oral dosing with bupropion sustained-release (SR) in healthy volunteers. Methods: Six healthy male volunteers received bupropion SR 150 mg daily on days I through 3 and 150 mg every 12 hours on day 4 through the morning of day 11. PET investigations were performed between I and 7 days before initiation of bupropion SR dosing, as well as 3, 12, and 24 hours after the last dose of bupropion SR on day 11. Results: Bupropion and its metabolites inhibited striatal uptake of the selective DAT-binding radioligand C-11-betaCIT-FE in vivo. Three hours after the last dose of bupropion SR, average DAT occupancy by bupropion and its metabolites was 26%-a level that was maintained through the last PET assessment at 24 hours after dosing. Conclusions: Bupropion and its metabolites induced a low occupancy of the striatal DAT over 24 hours under conditions of steady-state oral dosing with therapeutic doses of bupropion SR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that dopamine reuptake inhibition may be responsible in part for the therapeutic effects of the drug. (C) 2003 Society of Biological Psychiatry.

Mussels were dissected into four body parts-mantle, gills, digestive gland, and muscles-to determine the distribution of tissue-specific peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBRs). The specific binding was saturable and reversible. A statistically significant increase (muscle, 537% and mantle, 201%, as absolute percentages) in the maximal number of binding sites (B-max) was found in mussels from the polluted site, compared with mussels from the nonpolluted site. By contrast, the value of the dissociation constant (K-d) at equilibrium does not show a statistically significant variation between the two groups. In competitive experiments of the compounds clonazepam, flumazenil, flunitrazepam, Ro5-4864, PK11195, and protoporphyrin IX, only PK11195 and protoporphyrin IX displaced [H-3]PK11195 specifically bound to soft tissue membranes, revealing that the binding sites of peripheral benzodiazepine receptors of mussels have pharmacological properties comparable to those of low vertebrates such as trout. M. galloprovincialis was also tested as an indicator of heavy metal exposure, and metal accumulation in the digestive gland was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS). The contents of Pb, Mn, and Zn in mussels collected off the polluted site were higher than those in mussels from the nonpolluted site. These data suggest that PBRs are present in the soft tissues of the mussel M. galloprovincialis. Here we report preliminary evidence of biochemical alterations in mussels from the polluted site.

Dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved with motivation and reward, its believed to regulate food intake in laboratory animals by modulating its rewarding effects through the nucleus accumbens (NA). Here we assess the involvement of dopamine in "nonhedonic" food motivation in humans. Changes in extracellular dopamine in striatum in response to nonhedonic food stimulation (display of food without consumption) were evaluated in 10 food-deprived subjects 16-20 h) using positron emission tomography (PET) and [C-11]raclopride (a D2 receptor radioligand that competes with endogenous dopamine for binding to the receptor). To amplify the dopamine changes we pretreated subjects with methylphenidate (20 mg p.o.), a drug that blocks dopamine transporters (mechanism for removal of extracellular dopamine). Although the food stimulation when preceded by placebo did not increase dopamine or the desire for food, the food stimulation when preceded by methylphenidate (20 mg p.o.) did. The increases in extracellular dopamine were significant in dorsal (P < 0.005) but not in ventral striatum (area that included NA) and were significantly correlated with the increases in self-reports of hunger and desire for food (P < 0.01). These results provide the first evidence that dopamine in the dorsal striatum is involved in food motivation in humans that is distinct from its role in regulating reward through the NA.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying modulation of Ca2+ channel gating by DHPs has not been clarified. To search for novel determinants of high affinity DHP binding, we introduced point mutations in the rat brain Ca2+ channel alpha (1C) subunit (rbCII or Ca(v)1.2c) based on the comparison of amino acid sequences between rbCII and the ascidian L-type Ca2+ channel alpha (1) subunit, which is insensitive to DHPs. The alpha (1C) mutants (S1115A, S1146A, and A1420S) and rbCII were transiently expressed in BHK6 cells with beta (1a) and alpha (2)/delta subunits. The mutation did not affect the electrophysiological properties of the Ca2+ channel, or the voltage- and concentration-dependent block of Ca2+ channel currents produced by diltiazem and verapamil. However, the S1115A channel was significantly less sensitive to DHP antagonists. Interestingly, in the S1115A channel, DHP agonists failed to enhance whole-cell Ca2+ channel currents and the prolongation of mean open time, as well as the increment of NPo. Responsiveness to the non-DHP agonist FPL-64176 was also markedly reduced in the S1115A channel. When S1115 was replaced by other amino acids (S1115D, S1115T, or S1115V), only S1115T was slightly sensitive to S-(-)-Bay K 8644. These results indicate that the hydroxyl group of Ser(1115) in IIIS5-S6 linker of the L-type Ca2+ channel alpha (1C) subunit plays a critical role in DHP binding and in the action of DHP Ca2+ channel agonists.

Among them are studies such as long-term treatment of antidepressants whose mechanism of action regulates monoamine metabolism, monoamine receptor density and post-mortem studies. An acute increase in monoamine concentration at the synaptic cleft might induce desensitization of brain auto- and heteroreceptors which explains the therapeutic antidepressive response. This has been proved by monoamine depletion studies in which an antidepressant effect or a patient relapse has been observed. Likewise, the antidepressive therapeutic response occurs earlier when auto-receptors are pharmacologically blocked at nervous and somatodendritic terminals. In the first part of this review, post-mortem studies related with the serotoninergic system were analyzed, as well as the usefulness of measuring serotonin, triptophan, and serotonin metabolite levels in different biological fluids of depressed patients. In this second part, alterations in platelet transporter and serotonin receptors are discussed as platelet is considered a neural serotoninergic model. platelets are capable of storing and releasing serotonin in a similar manner as serotoninergic synaptosomes. Thus, platelets and serotoninergic synaptic terminals share biochemical and morphological properties. Serotonin transporter in platelets of depressed patients Due to the difficulty to obtain human brain samples and disagreements in the post-mortem studies, platelets have been suggested as a peripheral model to study neural serotonin uptake. The model is supported by the fact that platelet properties are similar to those of neuronal serotoninergic synaptic terminals. Serotonin studies in platelets have been useful in clinical aspects such as depressive disturbances. Radioligand studies in platelets from untreated depressed patients have shown a decrease in [H-3]- imipramine binding sites, compared to the binding in platelets from control subjects. Since that decrease has been consistently confirmed in studies on affective subjects, it has been proposed as a specific biomarker of depressed patients. Nevertheless, some researchers have not found similar results, and no explanation of the variability in the density of [H-3]imipramine binding sites has been proposed. Serotonin receptor changes in depressed patients The hypothesis on receptor adaptative changes proposes that there is a depletion of monoaminergic neurotransmitters in depressed subjects,which induces a compensatory regulation in the number and/or function of receptors. To explore this different techniques as the following have been developed: Techniques to evaluate receptor density and affinity, including post-mortem radioligand binding to serotonin receptors in brain tissue and in platelets from depressed patients. Techniques to evaluate receptor regulation and sensitivity by using neuroendocrine tests described below. Somatodendritic 5HT(1A) autoreceptor dysfunction in depressive disorders Dysfunction of presynaptic somatodendritic 5HT(1A) autoreceptors has been found in behavioral changes related to anxiety, depression and alcoholism. Neuroendocrine tests after the administration of 5-HT1A agonists have been used as an index of 5-HT1A receptor function. It seems that azapirodecanediones increase plasmatic concentrations of prolactin, somatotropin, and adrenocorticotropin; the also seem to decrease body temperature. In depressed patients, the hypothermia response, following presynaptic 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, and the neuroendocrine response, following hypothalamus postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor stimulation, were both diminished. These findings suggest a desensitization or down-regulation of pre- and post-synaptic 5-HT1A receptors in depressed patients. Platelet 5-HT2A receptors in depressed patients Density and affinity Most radioligand Studies have found an increase of platelet 5-HT1A receptors either in major depression patients or in attempted suicide patients. However, Rosel et al. studied platelets from depressed patients, finding an increment in the 5-HT2A platelet receptors affinity for [H-3]-ketanscrin, but not in the receptors density. Functional capacity The evaluation of receptor function and sensitivity in platelets is performed after scrotonin stimulation by using neuroendocrine tests and some other functional tests, Such as platelet aggregation, morphological changes, quantification of intracellular calcium, and second messengers quantification. Despite being widelv! used, neuroendocrine tests are not completely reliable because they could be influenced by factors Such as: stress on the hypothalamus-hypophysis axis, the lack of stereo-selective agonists and antagonists for different subtype serotonin receptors, and the effect of the drugs oil other neurotransinitter systems. Other methodological aspects, Such as: Population heterogencity, small samples, lack of variable control (i.e. age, sex, closes, diet, menstrual cycle), and placebo effects, are limitations to the neuroendocrine tests related to a single neurotransmitter system (serotonin).Results from platelet functional studies are contradictory as well. platelet aggregation assays in depressed patients suggested a down-regulation of 5-HT1A receptors, compared to platelets from healthy, subjects. However, some other studies have found no differences. Other platelet function responses mediated by 5HT(2A) receptors, such,is morphology changes, intracellular calcium, and phosphatidyl inositol hydrolysis, suggest a receptor up-regulation or hypersensitivity in depressed patients. Despite some disagreement among the results of platelet 5-HT2A receptor Studies in depressed patients, most of them have reported all increase in 5-HT1A receptors density in these patients. However, suicidal behavior is clearly correlated to such an increase. Similar results have been observed in most post-mortem studies reporting an increase of 5-HT1A,A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. protein synthesis and mRNA for 5-HT1A receptors are increased in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus in adolescent and adult suicide victims. These findings suggest that changes in the brain serotonergic system are related to depressive states and suicidal behavior. Human brain imaging techniques as well as molecular genetics studies may be additional tools to Support the understanding of the neurobiology of depressive states, and their treatment.

Several studies have suggested that the lipophilicity of a molecule can play an important role. To date, this aspect has been studied for several G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) ligands but not for the 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R), a GPCR proposed as a valid therapeutic target in neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with abnormal neuronal connectivity. In this study, we report on structure-kinetics relationships of a set of arylpiperazine-based 5-HT7R ligands. We found that it is not the overall lipophilicity of the molecule that influences drug-target interaction kinetics but rather the position of polar groups within the molecule. Next, we performed a combination of molecular docking studies and molecular dynamics simulations to gain insights into structure-kinetics relationships. These studies did not suggest specific contact patterns between the ligands and the receptor-binding site as determinants for compounds kinetics. Finally, we compared the abilities of two 5-HT7R agonists with similar receptor-binding affinities and different residence times to stimulate the 5-HT7R-mediated neurite outgrowth in mouse neuronal primary cultures and found that the compounds induced the effect with different timing. This study provides the first insights into the binding kinetics of arylpiperazine-based 5-HT7R ligands that can be helpful to design new 5-HT7R ligands with fine-tuning of the kinetic profile.

Decreased astrocyte-related proteins (e.g., glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and atrophic astrocytes in corticolimbic brain areas implicated in PTSD have been reported in experimental models suggesting that astrocyte pathology may be a feature of this disorder. We used positron emission tomography (PET) of the monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B probe [C-11]SL25.1188 to test the hypothesis that levels of MAO-B, an index of astrocyte levels is decreased in PTSD. MAO-B availability ([C-11]SL25.1188 distribution volume) was measured in 13 participants with PTSD (similar to 39 years, 6F) and 17 healthy controls (HC) (similar to 31 years, 9F). A magnetic resonance image was acquired to delineate 6 cortiolimbic brain regions. PTSD was associated with a trending reduction in [C-11]SL25.1188 availability across regions (817%; p = 0.067) implicating the ventral striatum (p uncorrected = 0.015) and medial prefrontal cortex (p uncorrected = 0.060). [C-11]SL25.1188 availability was similar to 30% lower in corticolimbic regions in PTSD with co-morbid major depressive disorder (MDD) (n = 4) vs HC (p = 0.001) and vs PTSD without MDD (p = 0.005). Our preliminary results do not suggest astrogliosis (inferred from elevated availability) in PTSD, but rather point to a loss of astrocytes or an independent downregulation of MAO-B in PTSD with more severe negative affect. These exploratory findings, which are partly in line with preclinical literature and recent PET observations of decreased microglia marker, Translocator Protein, in PTSD, warrant replication in a larger PTSD cohort.

A double-blind placebo-controlled trial of minocycline on translocator protein distribution volume in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE; 18 KDA; BINDING-AFFINITY; BRAIN; INFLAMMATION; RADIOLIGAND; MARKER; NEUROINFLAMMATION	Gliosis is implicated in the pathophysiology of many neuropsychiatric diseases, including treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD). Translocator protein total distribution volume (TSPO V-T), a brain marker mainly reflective of gliosis in disease, can be measured using positron emission tomography (PET). Minocycline reduces gliosis and translocator protein binding in rodents, but this is not established in humans. Here, the ability of oral minocycline to reduce TSPO V-T was assessed in TRD. To determine whether oral minocycline, as compared to placebo, can reduce prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and insula TSPO V-T in TRD, twenty-one TRD participants underwent two [F-18]FEPPA PET scans to measure TSPO V-T. These were completed before and after either oral minocycline 100 mg bid or placebo which was administered in a randomized double-blinded fashion for 8 weeks. There was no significant difference between the minocycline and placebo groups on change in TSPO V-T within the PFC, ACC, and insula (repeated measures ANOVA, effect of group interaction, PFC: F-1,F-19 = 0.28, P = 0.60; ACC: F-1,F-19 = 0.54, P = 0.47; insula F-1,F-19 = 1.6, P = 0.22). Oral minocycline had no significant effect on TSPO V-T which suggests that this dosage is insufficient to reduce gliosis in TRD. To target gliosis in TRD either alternative therapeutics or intravenous formulations of minocycline should be investigated. These results also suggest that across neuropsychiatric diseases in humans, it should be assumed that oral minocycline will not reduce TSPO V-T or gliosis unless empirically demonstrated.

PART; ICCAM PLATFORM	Addiction has been proposed as a 'reward deficient' state, which is compensated for with substance use. There is growing evidence of dysregulation in the opioid system, which plays a key role in reward, underpinning addiction. Low levels of endogenous opioids are implicated in vulnerability for developing alcohol dependence (AD) and high mu-opioid receptor (MOR) availability in early abstinence is associated with greater craving. This high MOR availability is proposed to be the target of opioid antagonist medication to prevent relapse. However, changes in endogenous opioid tone in AD are poorly characterised and are important to understand as opioid antagonists do not help everyone with AD. We used [C-11]carfentanil, a selective MOR agonist positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, to investigate endogenous opioid tone in AD for the first time. We recruited 13 abstinent male AD and 15 control participants who underwent two [C-11]carfentanil PET scans, one before and one 3 h following a 0.5 mg/kg oral dose of dexamphetamine to measure baseline MOR availability and endogenous opioid release. We found significantly blunted dexamphetamine-induced opioid release in 5 out of 10 regions-of-interest including insula, frontal lobe and putamen in AD compared with controls, but no significantly higher MOR availability AD participants compared with HC in any region. This study is comparable to our previous results of blunted dexamphetamine-induced opioid release in gambling disorder, suggesting that this dysregulation in opioid tone is common to both behavioural and substance addictions.

Theranostic Targeting of CUB Domain Containing Protein 1 (CDCP1) in Pancreatic Cancer	CLINICAL CANCER RESEARCH			English	Article							CELL-MIGRATION; ELEVATED CDCP1; INVASION; IDENTIFICATION; EXPRESSION; CARCINOMA; SURVIVAL	Purpose: The recent emergence of radioligand therapies for cancer treatment has increased enthusiasm for developing new theranostic strategies coupling both imaging and cytotoxicity in the same entity. In this study, we evaluated whether CUB domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a single-pass transmembrane protein highly overexpressed in diverse human cancers, might be a target for cancer theranostics. Experimental Design: The ectodomain of CDCP1 was targeted using radiolabeled forms of 4A06, a potent and specific recombinant human antibody that we developed. Imaging and antitumor assessment studies were performed in animal models of pancreatic cancer, including two patient-derived xenograft models we developed for this study. For antitumor assessment studies, the endpoints were death due to tumor volume >3,000 mm(3) or >= 20% loss in body weight. Specific tracer binding or antitumor effects were assessed with an unpaired, two-tailed Student t test and survival advantages were assessed with a log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. Differences at the 95% confidence level were interpreted to be significant. Results: Zr-89-4A06 detected a broad dynamic range of full length or cleaved CDCP1 expression on seven human pancreatic cancer tumors (n = 4/tumor). Treating mice with single or fractionated doses of Lu-177-4A06 significantly reduced pancreatic cancer tumor volume compared with mice receiving vehicle or unlabeled 4A06 (n = 8; P < 0.01). A single dose of Ac-225-4A06 also inhibited tumor growth, although the effect was less profound compared with Lu-177-4A06 (n = 8; P < 0.01). A significant survival advantage was imparted by Ac-225-4A06 (HR = 2.56; P < 0.05). Conclusions: These data establish that CDCP1 can be exploited for theranostics, a finding with widespread implications given its breadth of overexpression in cancer.

The binding activity of the subtypes was examined, and the structure-activity relationship of this class of compounds at the A(2A) receptor was investigated. A fragment-based computer-aided design method was used to modify the 2-position side chain structures with different structural fragments, and the newly generated molecules were docked to the A(2A) receptor to assess scoring and screening activity. To synthesize compounds with better scoring activity, the newly synthesized compounds were tested for in vitro receptor binding activity. 2-Hydrazinyladenosine derivatives of 32 new structural types were designed and synthesized, with the most potent adenosine derivative 23 exhibiting a K-i value of 1.8 nM for A(2A)AR and significant selectivity for the A(2A) receptor compared to the A(1) receptor. In addition to, compound 23, 24, 30, 31, and 42 also exhibited potent A(2A) receptor selectivity, with Ki values for the A(2A) receptor of 6.4, 20, 67 and 6.3 nM, respectively. We also found that compound 35 has a high A(1) receptor selectivity, with a K-i value for the A(1) receptor of 4.5 nM. Further functional assays also demonstrated that these compounds have potent A(2A) receptor agonist activity. The study shows the applicability of an in silico fragment-based molecular design for rational lead optimization in A(2A)AR. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The molecular identity of the NAADP receptor has yet to be defined. In pursuit of isolating and identifying NAADP-binding proteins, we synthesized and characterized a bifunctional probe that incorporates both a photoactivatable crosslinking azido moiety at the 5-position of the nicotinic ring and a 'clickable' ethynyl moiety to the 8-adenosyl position in NAADP. Microinjection of this 5N(3)-8-ethynyl-NAADP into cultured U2OS cells induced robust Ca2+ responses. Higher concentrations of 5N(3)-8-ethynyl were required to elicit Ca2+ release or displace P-32-NAADP in radioligand binding experiments in sea urchin egg homogenates. In human cell extracts, incubation of P-32-5N(3)-8-ethynyl-NAADP followed by UV irradiation resulted in selective labeling of 23 kDa and 35 kDa proteins and photolabeling of these proteins was prevented when incubated in the presence of unlabeled NAADP. Compared to the monofunctional P-32-5N(3)-NAADP, the clickable P-32-5N(3)-8-ethynyl-NAADP demonstrated less labeling of the 23 kDa and 35 kDa proteins (similar to 3-fold) but provided an opportunity for further enrichment through the 'clickable' ethynyl moiety. No proteins were specifically labeled by P-32-5N(3)-8-ethynyl-NAADP in sea urchin egg homogenate. These experiments demonstrate that 5N(3)-8-ethynyl-NAADP is biologically active and selectively labels putative NAADP-binding proteins in mammalian systems, evidencing a 'bifunctional' probe with utility for isolating NAADP-binding proteins.

Resveratrol, a natural polyphenol phytoalexin, can inhibit serotonin transporters (SERT) to increase synaptic 5-HT levels. In this study, we investigated the effects of resveratrol on noise-induced damage in the serotonergic system. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were anaesthetized and exposed to an 8-kHz tone at 116 dB for 3.5 h. Resveratrol (30 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection [IP]) and citalopram (20 mg/kg, IP), a specific SERT inhibitor used as a positive control, were administered once a day for four consecutive days, with the first treatment occurring 2 days before noise exposure. Auditory brainstem response testing and positron emission tomography (PET) with N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[F-18]fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[F-18]-ADAM, a specific radioligand for SERT) were used to evaluate functionality of the auditory system and integrity of the serotonergic system, respectively, before and after noise exposure. Finally, immunohistochemistry was performed 1 day after the last PET scan. Our results indicate that noise-induced serotonergic fiber loss occurred in multiple brain regions including the midbrain, thalamus, hypothalamus, striatum, auditory cortex, and frontal cortex. This noise-induced damage to the serotonergic system was ameliorated in response to treatment with resveratrol and citalopram. However, noise exposure increased the hearing threshold in the rats regardless of drug treatment status. We conclude that resveratrol has protective effects against noise-induced loss of SERT.

Endomorphins are among the most active endogenous opioid peptides, and they have good affinity and selectivity toward the mu opioid receptor. However, their clinical usage is hindered by their inability to cross the blood brain barrier and their poor in vivo activity after peripheral injection. In order to overcome these defects, we have designed and synthesized a series of novel endomorphin analogs with multiple site modifications. Radioligand binding cAMP accumulation, and beta-arrestin-2 recruitment assays were employed to determine the activity of synthesized endomorphin analogs toward opioid receptors. The blood brain barrier permeability and antinociceptive effect of these analogs were determined in several rodent models of acute and persistent pain. In addition, the side effects of the analogs were examined. The raloligand binding assay and functional activity examination indicated that the MEL-N16 series of compounds were more active agonists against mu opioid receptor than were the parent peptides. Notably, the analogs displayed biased downstream signaling toward G-protein pathways over beta-arrestin-2 recruitment. The analogs showed highly potent antinociceptive effects in the tested nociceptive models. In comparison with endomorphins, the synthesized analogs were better able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and exerted their pain regulatory activity in the central nervous system after peripheral injection. These analogs also have lower tendency to cause side effects than morphine does at similar or equal antinociceptive doses. The MEL-N16 compounds have highly potent and efficacious analgesic effects in various pain models with a favorable side effect profile.

However, radioligands used to estimate D2/D3R are displaceable by endogenous DA and are nonselective for D2R, leaving the relationship between TaqIA genotype and D2R specific binding uncertain. Using the positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, (N-[C-11]methyl)benperidol ([C-11]NMB), which is highly selective for D2R over D3R and is not displaceable by endogenous DA, the current study examined whether DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA genotype predicts D2R specific binding in two independent samples. Sample 1 (n = 39) was composed of obese and nonobese adults; sample 2 (n = 18) was composed of healthy controls, unmedicated individuals with schizophrenia, and siblings of individuals with schizophrenia. Across both samples, A1 allele carriers (A1+) had 5 to 12% less striatal D2R specific binding relative to individuals homozygous for the A2 allele (A1-), regardless of body mass index or diagnostic group. This reduction is comparable to previous PET studies of D2/D3R availability (10-14%). The pooled effect size for the difference in total striatal D2R binding between A1+ and A1- was large (0.84). In summary, in line with studies using displaceable D2/D3R radioligands, our results indicate that DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA allele status predicts striatal D2R specific binding as measured by D2R-selective [C-11]NMB. These findings support the hypothesis that DRD2/ANKK1 TaqIA allele status may modify D2R, perhaps conferring risk for certain disease states.

Due to its open nature, cell-free protein production is a versatile tool to introduce specific labels such as heavy isotopes, non-natural amino acids and tags into the protein while avoiding cell toxicity. In particular, radiolabelled peptides and proteins are valuable tools for the functional characterization of protein-protein interactions and for studying binding kinetics. In this study we evaluated cell-free protein production for the generation of radiolabelled ligands for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors are seven-transmembrane-domain receptors activated by a plethora of extracellular stimuli including peptide ligands. Many GPCR peptide ligands contain disulphide bonds and are thus inherently difficult to produce in bacterial expression hosts or in Escherichia coli-based cell-free systems. Here, we established an adapted E. coli-based cell-free translation system for the production of disulphide bond-containing GPCR peptide ligands and specifically introduce tritium labels for detection. The bacterial oxidoreductase DsbA is used as a chaperone to favour the formation of disulphide bonds and to enhance the yield of correctly folded proteins and peptides. We demonstrate the correct folding and formation of disulphide bonds and show high-affinity ligand binding of the produced radio peptide ligands to the respective receptors. Thus, our system allows the fast, cost-effective and reliable synthesis of custom GPCR peptide ligands for functional and structural studies.

Our aim was to label a series of structurally related PDE10A inhibitors with carbon-11 and evaluate them as potential positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands for PDE10A using nonhuman primates. The series consisted of seven compounds based on the 3-(1H-pyrazol-5-yl) pyridazin-4(1H)-one backbone. These compounds were selected from the initial larger library based on a number of parameters such as affinity, selectivity for hPDE10A in in vitro tests, lipophilicity, and on the results of multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1)-LLCPK1 and the parallel artificial membrane permeability assays. Seven radioligands (KIT-1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12) were radiolabeled with carbon-11 employing O-methylation on the hydroxyl moiety using [C-11]methyl triflate. In vivo examination of each radioligand was performed using PET in rhesus monkeys; analysis of radiometabolites in plasma also was conducted using HPLC. All seven radioligands were labeled with high (>90%) incorporation of [C-11] methyl triflate into their appropriate precursors and with high specific radioactivity. Carbon-11 labeled KIT-5 and KIT-6 showed high accumulation in the striatum, consistent with the known anatomical distribution of PDE10A in brain, accompanied by fast washout and high specific binding ratio. In particular [C-11] KIT-6, named [C-11] T-773, is a promising PET tool for further examination of PDE10A in human brain.

Nonpeptide antagonists with high affinity and selectivity have been described for the Y1R, Y2R and Y5R, but such compounds are still lacking for the Y4R. In this work, the structures of the high affinity selective (R)-argininamide-type Y1R antagonists BIBP3226 and BIBO3304 were linked via the guanidine or urea moieties to give homo-dimeric argininamides with linker lengths ranging from 31 to 41 atoms. Interestingly, the twin compounds proved to be by far less selective for the Y1R than the R-configured monovalent parent compounds. The decrease in selectivity ratio was most pronounced for Y1R versus Y4R subtype, resulting in comparable affinities of bivalent ligands for Y1R and Y4R (e.g. UR-MK177 ((R, R)-49): K-i = 230 nM (Y1R) and 290 nM (Y4R)). With a Ki value of 130 nM and a K-b value of 20 nM, UR-MK188 ((R,R)-51) was superior to all Y4R antagonists known to date. The S, S-configured optical antipodes of UR-MK177 and UR-MK188 (UR-MEK381 ((S, S)-49) and UR-MEK388 ((S,S)-51)) were synthesized to investigate the stereochemical discrimination by the different receptor subtypes. Whereas preference for R, R-configured argininamides was characteristic of the Y1R, stereochemical discrimination by the Y4R was not observed. This may pave the way to selective Y4R antagonists.

We have explored the potential to complement NMR-based biophysical screening of chemical libraries with molecular docking in FBLD against the A(2A) adenosine receptor (A(2A)AR), a drug target for inflammation and Parkinson's disease. Prior to an NMR-based screen of a fragment library against the A(2A)AR, molecular docking against a crystal structure was used to rank the same set of molecules by their predicted affinities. Molecular docking was able to predict four out of the five orthosteric ligands discovered by NMR among the top 5% of the ranked library, suggesting that structure-based methods could be used to prioritize among primary hits from biophysical screens. In addition, three fragments that were top-ranked by molecular docking, but had not been picked up by the NMR-based method, were demonstrated to be A2AAR ligands. While biophysical approaches for fragment screening are typically limited to a few thousand compounds, the docking screen was extended to include 328,000 commercially available fragments. Twenty-two top-ranked compounds were tested in radioligand binding assays, and 14 of these were A(2A)AR ligands with K-i values ranging from 2 to 240 mu M.

We investigated the distribution and clinical features of ZnT8A positive latent autoimmune diabetes in adult (LADA) patients to explore the potential diagnostic application. Methods A total of 3062 phenotypic T2DM patients were randomly selected from a national multicenter study - the LADA China Study. Radioligand binding assays were applied to detect the presence of ZnT8A, GADA and IA-2A. HbA(1c), fasting C-peptide and serum lipid levels were followed up with ZnT8A positive patients. Results The positive prevalence of ZnT8A, GADA and IA-2A in phenotypic T2DM patients was 1.99%(61/3062), 6.43% (197/3062) and 1.96% (60/3062), respectively. The ZnT8A positivity was lower than that of GADA(x(2)= 74.8, p< 0.001) but was comparable with that of IA-2A(p> 0.05). The positivity of ZnT8A in IA-2A positive patients was higher than that in GADA positive patients (38.3% vs. 10.7%, x(2)= 24.8, p< 0.001). On the basis of GADA and IA-2A positivity, the ZnT8A assay enhanced the diagnostic prevalence of LADA from 7.58 to 8.62%. The LADA patients who were positive for ZnT8A had higher systolic blood pressure when compared with GADA positive cases(p= 0.049) and higher total cholesterol levels when compared with antibody-negative T2DM patients(p= 0.035). Conclusion The detection of ZnT8A at the basis of GADA and IA-2A can improve diagnostic sensitivity of Chinese LADA. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

It was assumed previously that there is a single binding site for fatty acids and synthetic FFA1 agonists. However, using members of two chemical series of partial and full agonists that have been identified, radioligand binding interaction studies revealed that the full agonists do not bind to the same site as the partial agonists but exhibit positive heterotropic cooperativity. Analysis of functional data reveals positive functional cooperativity between the full agonists and partial agonists in various functional assays (in vitro and ex vivo) and also in vivo. Furthermore, the endogenous fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) shows negative or neutral cooperativity with members of both series of agonists in binding assays but displays positive cooperativity in functional assays. Another synthetic agonist is allosteric with members of both agonist series, but apparently competitive with DHA. Therefore, there appear to be three allosterically linked binding sites on FFA1 with agonists specific for each of these sites. Activation of free fatty acid 1 receptor (FFAR1) by each of these agonists is differentially affected by mutations of two arginine residues, previously found to be important for FFAR1 binding and activation. These ligands with their high potencies and strong positive functional cooperativity with endogenous fatty acids, demonstrated in vitro and in vivo, have the potential to deliver therapeutic benefits.

These agents have been associated with cardiac and neurological toxicities. Because these agents are analogues of adenosine, they may act through adenosine receptors to elicit their toxic effects. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of cytotoxic nucleoside analogues to bind and activate adenosine receptor subtypes (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3)). Radioligand binding studies utilizing Chinese hamster ovary cells, stably transfected with adenosine A(1), A(2A), or A(3) receptor subtype, were used to assess the binding affinities of these compounds, whereas adenylyl cyclase activity was used to assess the binding to A(2B) receptors. Clofarabine and cladribine both bound to the A(2A) receptor with a K (i) of 17 and 15 mu M, respectively. Clofarabine was the only adenosine analogue to bind to the A(3) receptor with a K (i) of 10 mu M, and none of these compounds bound to the A(2B) receptor. Results show that clofarabine, cladribine, and fludarabine bind to the A(1) receptor. In addition, clofarabine, cladribine, and fludarabine were A(1) agonists (IC50 3.1, 30, and 30 mu M, respectively). Neither pyrimidine nucleoside analogues gemcitabine nor cytarabine associated with any of the adenosine receptor subtypes (K (i) > 100 mu M). This is the first report of an interaction between all adenosine receptor subtypes and chemotherapeutic nucleoside analogues commonly used in the treatment of cancer. Therefore, activation of these receptors may be at least one mechanism through which fludarabine-associated toxicity occurs.

These CB1-mediated side effects are due to the fact that CB1 receptors are largely expressed in the central nervous system (CNS). As it is known that CB1 receptors are also located peripherally, there is growing interest in targeting cannabinoid receptors located outside the brain. A library of chromenopyrazoles designed analogously to the classical cannabinoid cannabinol were synthesized, characterized, and tested for cannabinoid activity. Radioligand binding assays were used to determine their affinities at CB1 and CB2 receptors. Structural features required for CB1/CB2 affinity and selectivity were explored by molecular modeling. Some compounds in the chromenopyrazole series were observed to be selective CB1 ligands. These modeling studies suggest that full CB1 selectivity over CB2 can be explained by the presence of a pyrazole ring in the structure. The functional activities of selected chromenopyrazoles were evaluated in isolated tissues. In vivo behavioral tests were then carried out on the most effective CB1 cannabinoid agonist, 13?a. Chromenopyrazole 13?a did not induce modifications in any of the tested parameters on the mouse cannabinoid tetrad, thus discounting CNS-mediated effects. This lack of agonistic activity in the CNS suggests that this compound does not readily cross the bloodbrain barrier. Moreover, 13?a can induce antinociception in a rat peripheral model of orofacial pain. Taking into account the negative results obtained with the hot-plate test, the antinociception induced by 13?a in the orofacial test could be mediated through peripheral mechanisms.

Having the possibility to conjugate the targeting molecule with different radionuclides would offer more flexibility and potential advantages depending on clinical situations. Since various iodine isotopes are currently used in nuclear medicine and in pharmacological studies, we have evaluated which iodination method should be privileged in order to produce a good iodinated AM-derived nuclear medicine agent. Methods: Synthetic AM was labeled with iodine through chemical and lactoperoxidase oxidation methods. Position of the iodine atom on the peptide was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis following cyanogen bromide cleavage and carboxypeptidase Y digestion. Binding affinity of iodinated AM analogues was evaluated by competition and saturation binding experiments on dog lung preparations. Results: In this study, we demonstrated that, upon lactoperoxidase oxidation, iodination occurred at Tyr(1) and that this radioligand retained higher binding affinity and specificity over preparations obtained through chemical oxidation. Conclusions: These results emphasize the fact that even a small chemical modification, i.e. iodination, might deeply modify the pharmacological profile of a compound and support observations that the C-terminal tail of human AM plays an important role in the AM receptor binding process. Consequently, incorporation of a radionuclide to produce an AM-based nuclear medicine agent should privilege the N-terminus of the molecule. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods. We suggest 5-pyrrolidinylsulfonyl isatins; as a potential nonpeptidyl class of caspase inhibitors for the design of caspase binding radioligands (CbRs), that could be used for in vivo visualization of activated effector caspases. The caspase inhibitor (S)-(+)-5-[1-(2-Methoxymethylpyrrolidiny)suffonyl]isatin 1 (Ki, (caspare-3) (1)=60 nm) was chosen as lead structure for th development of nonpeptidyl CbRs. Its structural expansion at the NI-position the yields moderate lipophilicp-(2-fluoroethoxy)benzyl variant 2 (log D=2.2), without loss of caspase binding potency (IC50, caspase-3 (2)=36.4 nM). Results. Subsequent automated radiosynthesis of the corresponding F-18-labeled target CbR [F-18]2 was performed by direct F-18-labeling of tosylate precursor 4. Conclusion. As shown by biodistribution studies and small animal positron emission tomography a nonpeptidyl 5-pyrrolidinylsulfonyl isatin-type caspase inhibitor (S)-1-(4-(2-[F-18]Fluoroetho-xy)benzyl)-5-[1-(2-methoxymethylpyrrolidinyl)sulfonyllisatin [F-18]2 with rapid blood clearance characteristics could potentially detect apoptosis in vivo.

J	Wittnich, C; Belanger, MP; Bandali, K				Wittnich, Carin; Belanger, Michael P.; Bandali, Karim			Are there ventricle-specific postnatal maturational differences in myocardial β-adrenoceptors?	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						beta-adrenoceptors; development; ventricle; neonate; adult	ADENYLATE-CYCLASE; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; FETAL SHEEP; RAT-HEART; SENSITIVITY	Newborn hearts have restricted functional reserve and variable responsiveness to inotropes that could be partly due to differences in myocardial beta-adrenoceptors (beta-AR). To clarify this issue, this study documented ventricle-specific changes in myocardial beta-AR density and affinity during postnatal maturation. In vivo left and right ventricle (LV and RV, respectively) biopsies were obtained from newborn (3-day-old, n = 11), immature (14-day-old, n = 7), and adult (n = 6) pigs. Total beta-AR density (B-max, fmol/g) and dissociation constant (K-d, pmol/L) were determined by radioligand binding with I-125 iodocyanopindolol. Overall, beta-AR B-max in the LV significantly decreased with maturation. Interestingly, newborn animal hearts (LV and RV) subdivided into 2 groups: an adult-like low K-d group with low B-max and a fetal-like high K-d group with high B-max, which were significantly different from one another. The high K-d newborn group also had significantly higher K-d and B-max than both immature and adult hearts. Newborns had similar B-max but higher K-d in the LV than the RV, whereas immature and adult hearts did not have ventricular differences. During maturation, beta-AR density decreased, whereas LV beta-AR binding affinity increased. Variable beta-AR maturity was also identified immediately post partum, which could potentially explain the newborn heart's variable responsiveness to inotropes. The subset of newborn hearts with lower binding affinity (reduced responsiveness) could also contribute to the newborn heart's overall reduction in functional reserve.

Evidence for multiple sites within rat ventral striatum mediating cocaine-conditioned place preference and locomotor activation	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS CORE; OLFACTORY TUBERCLE; MESOLIMBIC DOPAMINE; D-AMPHETAMINE; 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE LESIONS; INTRAVENOUS COCAINE; SHELL SUBREGION; STIMULATION; REWARD; INVOLVEMENT	Considerable evidence suggests that psychostimulants can exert rewarding and locomotor-stimulating effects via increased dopamine transmission in the ventral striatum. However, the relative contributions of ventral striatal subregions to each of these effects have been little investigated. In the present study, we examined the contribution of different ventral striatal sites to the rewarding and locomotor-activating effects of cocaine. Initially, the effects of bilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesions of the nucleus accumbens core or medial shell on cocaine-induced locomotor stimulation (0.5-1.5 mg/kg i.v. or 5-20 mg/kg i.p.)and conditioned place preference (0.5 mg/kg i.v. or 10 mg/kg i.p.) were examined. In a subsequent study, we investigated the effects of olfactory tubercle versus medial shell lesions on cocaine-conditioned place preference and locomotor activity (0.5 mg/kg i.v.). Dopaminergic lesion extent was quantified by radioligand binding to the dopamine transporter. Multiple linear regression was used to identify associations between behavioral effects and residual dopamine innervation in ventral striatal subregions. On this basis, the accumbens core was associated with the locomotor stimulant effects of i.v. and i.p. cocaine. In contrast, the medial shell was associated with the rewarding effect of i.v. cocaine, but not of i.p. cocaine. Finally, the olfactory tubercle was identified as an additional site contributing to conditioned place preference produced by i.v. cocaine. Overall, these findings provide additional evidence that the locomotor stimulant and rewarding effects of systemically administered psychomotor stimulant drugs are segregated within the ventral striatum.

J	Ebert, EC; Mehta, V				Ebert, Ellen C.; Mehta, Vishal			Human intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes keep TNFα levels low by cell uptake and feedback inhibition of transcription	CELLULAR IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						tumor necrosis factor alpha; interferon gamma; intraepithelial lymphocytes; mucosal immunology	TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; INTERFERON-GAMMA; IFN-GAMMA; INTERLEUKIN-12; IL-12; RESPONSES; DISEASE; MUCOSA	Background. Human intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are mainly TCR alpha beta(+)CD8(+) T cells, juxtaposed between epithelial cells. Their release of TNF alpha, a cytokine that is toxic to the epithelium, is likely to be tightly regulated. This study documents a novel mechanism to keep TNFa levels low with stimuli that cause large fluctuations in IFN gamma release. Methods. IELs were stimulated with combinations of IL-2, IL-12, and IL-15, without TCR ligation. TNF alpha and IFN gamma production was assessed at both the mRNA and protein levels. Uptake of both cytokines was analyzed by radioligand binding. Results. By 72 h with IL-15, IFN gamma concentrations increased markedly, while TNF alpha. remained low. With IL-12 supplementation, IFN gamma increased 10-fold, while TNF alpha remained low. Initially, IELs had similar amounts of transcripts for IFN gamma and TNF alpha, indicating equivalent synthetic rates. Two events explain the low extracellular accumulation of TNFa. First, IELs took up 25-30% of bound I-125-TNF alpha without undergoing apoptosis. In contrast, they incorporated little IFN gamma. Second, TNF alpha was under strict feedback control as shown by the reduction in transcription with the addition of TNFa. No feedback control was seen with IFN gamma. Conclusions. Extracellular TNF alpha, but not IFN gamma, levels are kept low by uptake of free cytokine followed by a decline in transcription, thereby avoiding accumulation of this potentially toxic cytokine.

An alternative hypothesis was investigated: Antioxidants that are also strong reducers of disulfide bonds inhibit the binding of Ang II to its surface receptors with consequent attenuation of signal transduction and cell action. Incubation of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells, which possess Ang II type 1 alpha receptors, with the reducing agent n-acetylcysteine (NAC) for 1 h at 37 degrees C resulted in decreased Ang II radioligand binding in a concentration-dependent pattern. NAC removal restored Ang II binding within 30 min. Incubation with n-acetylserine, a nonreducing analogue of NAC, did not lower Ang II binding, and oxidized NAC was less effective than reduced NAC in lowering Ang II binding. NAC did not decrease Ang II type 1 alpha receptor protein content. Other antioxidants regulated Ang II receptors differently: alpha-Lipoic acid lowered Ang II binding after 24 h, and vitamin E did not lower Ang II binding at all. NAC inhibited Ang II binding in cell membranes at 21 or 37 but not VC. Dihydrolipoic acid (the reduced form of alpha-lipoic acid), which contains free sulfhydryl groups as NAC does, decreased Ang II receptor binding in cell membranes, whereas alpha-lipoic acid, which does not contain free sulfhydryl groups, did not. Ang II-stimulated inositol phosphate formation was decreased by preincubation with NAC (1 h) or alpha-lipoic acid (24 h) but not vitamin E. In conclusion, certain antioxidants that are reducing agents lower Ang II receptor binding, and Ang II-stimulated signal transduction is decreased in proportion to decreased receptor binding.

Hepatic endosomes incubated at neutral pH rapidly degraded native glucagon into 13 intermediate products, one of which corresponded to the bioactive fragment glucagon-(19-29) (miniglucagon). The serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride as well as the nonspecific protease inhibitor bacitracin inhibited the endosomal degradation of glucagon at pH 7. In purified endosomal fractions, miniglucagon endopeptidase was undetectable as evaluated by immunoblotting, and immunoprecipitation with antibodies to insulin-degrading enzyme, cathepsins B and D, or furin failed to remove the endosomal neutral glucagonase activity. Incubation of endosomal fractions and [I-125] iodoglucagon with the zero-length bifunctional cross-linker 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide resulted in specific labeling of a 170-kDa polypeptide. The labeling was completely inhibited by unlabeled glucagon (IC50 value, 5x10(-7) M) and bacitracin (IC50 value, 1 mug/ml), suggesting that it may correspond to a bacitracin-sensitive glucagon-degrading enzyme. Treatment of the I-125-labeled 170-kDa cross-linked polypeptide with N-glycanase demonstrated that the crosslinked complex contained approximately 30 kDa of N-linked oligosaccharides. Specific cross-linking of the 170-kDa polypeptide was also observed using [I-125] Tyr(12)-miniglucagon as the radioligand. Together, these data suggest that the 170-kDa glycoprotein represents a novel glucagon-degrading activity that could mediate glucagon proteolysis within endosomes before the acidification step and generate the bioactive (19-29) miniglucagon peptide.

Endothelin signaling is activated in a failing heart and may contribute to myocardial dysfunction and remodeling. Therefore, we investigated the regulation of proteins of the endothelin system (ppET-1, ECE and ETA-R and ETB-R) in the hearts of female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with respect to E2. 2 Relative expression levels of the respective cardiac mRNA obtained from sham-operated, ovariectomized and ovariectomized E2-substituted SHR were quantified by real-time PCR. Ovariectomy led to a significant upregulation of the ETB-R mRNA (2.6 +/- 0.8-fold) in the left ventricular myocardium, which was not attendant with an alteration of ETA-R, ECE and ppET-1 mRNA expression. 3 An upregulation of the relative expression level of ETB-R protein due to ovariectomy was also demonstrated by radioligand binding assay. 4 Upregulation of both ETB-R mRNA and ETB-R protein expression was completely inhibited by E2 replacement. 5 To confirm these results in in vitro experiments, we quantified the mRNA of ET-R subtypes from isolated cardiomyocytes in the presence and absence of E2 (10(-8) m, 24 h). Our data showed a markedly downregulated level of ETB-R mRNA in cardiomyocytes stimulated with E2. ETB-R ownregulation was not attendant with the alteration of ETA-R, ECE and ppET-1 mRNA expression. 6 Taken together, these data demonstrate that estrogen regulates the expression of ETB-R in rat ventricular myocardium in vivo and in vitro. These observations may help to understand gender-based differences found in cardiovascular disease.

For most of these agents, the available biokinetic data are insufficient to construct realistic compound-specific biokinetic models for calculating the internal radiation dose delivered to persons undergoing investigation. A generic model for brain receptor substances that predicts the internal dose with sufficient accuracy for general radiation protection purposes has, therefore, been developed. Biokinetic data for 13 C-11-radiopharmaceuticals used clinically for imaging different brain receptors indicate that, despite differences in chemical structure. their uptake and retention in the human brain and other tissues are broadly similar. The proposed model assumes instantaneous deposition of 5% of the injected radioactivity in the brain, with the remaining radioactivity being rapidly and uniformly distributed throughout all other tissues. Elimination from all tissues is assumed to occur with a half-time of 2 h. It is further assumed that 75% of the injected C-11 is excreted in the urine, and 25% via the gall bladder, with a half-time of 2 h. This model yields all effective dose of 4.5 X 10(-3) mSv MBq(-1), with doses of 3.2 X 10(-2), 1.7 X 10(-2), 8.7 X 10(-3), 5.2 X 10(-3), and 3.8 X 10(-3) mGy MBq(-1) to the urinary bladder, gall bladder, kidneys, brain and ovaries, respectively. These closes are well within the range of those reported using compound-specific models for the radiopharmaceutals studied.

The nature of the implied heterogeneity has been studied with M-2 receptors in detergent-solubilized extracts of porcine atria. The relative capacity for [H-3]NMS and [H-3]QNB was about I in digitonin-cholate, 0.56 in cholate-NaCl, and 0.44 in Lubrol-PX. Adding digitonin to extracts in cholate-NaCl increased the absolute capacity for both radioligands, and the relative capacity increased to near 1. The latency cannot be attributed to a chemically impure radioligand, instability of the receptor, an irreversible effect of NMS, or a failure to reach equilibrium. Binding at near-saturating concentrations of [H-3]QNB in cholate-NaCl or Lubrol-PX was blocked fully by unlabeled NMS, which therefore appeared to inhibit noncompetitively at sites inaccessible to radiolabeled NMS. Such an effect is inconsistent with the notion of functionally distinct, noninterconverting, and mutually independent sites. Both the noncompetitive effect of NMS on [H-3]QNB and the shortfall in capacity for [H-3]NMS can be described quantitatively in terms of cooperative interactions within a receptor that is at least tetravalent; no comparable agreement is possible with a receptor that is only di- or trivalent. The M-2 muscarinic receptor therefore appears to comprise at least four interacting sites, presumably within a tetramer or larger array, and ligands appear to bind in a cooperative manner under at least some conditions.

However, the mechanism of action underlying its efficacy in mood disorders is not understood.

The density of 5-HTIA receptors was measured by radioligand binding assay using [H-3]8-OH-DPAT (0.05-0.8 nM) in frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats treated orally with LTG (5 mg/kg) for 7 days. AC activity was assayed using [H-3]ATP. The oral administration of LTG significantly decreased the density of cortical (50%, P < 0.001) but not hippocampal 5-HTIA receptors, without significant change in the affinity of [H-3]8-OH-DPAT to 5-HTIA receptor in these regions. There was no significant alteration in basal or forskolin-stimulated AC activity in either of regions. However, a significant decrease (P < 0.01) in the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated AC activity by 8-OH-DPAT was observed only in cortical membranes of LTG treated rats when compared to control. These results suggest that one mode of action of LTG may be by the downregulation of cortical 5-HTIA receptor-mediated AC response. (C) 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

Whole body scans were performed up to 24 h after intravenous injection of 370 MBq Tc-99m-ciprofloxacin in three male and three female volunteers. Blood samples were taken at various times up to 24 h after injection. Urine was also collected up to 24 h after injection, allowing calculation of renal clearance and interpretation of whole body clearance. Time-activity curves were generated for the thyroid, heart, liver and whole body by fitting the organ-specific geometric mean counts, obtained from regions of interest. The MIRD formulation was applied to calculate the absorbed radiation doses for various organs. The images showed rapid, predominantly urinary excretion of Tc-99m ciprofloxacin, with low to absent brain, lung and bone marrow uptake and low liver uptake and excretion. Accordingly, imaging conditions are excellent for both the thoracic and the abdominal region, even at early time points (60 min) post injection. In none of the volunteers was the gallbladder visualised. Approximately 60% of the injected activity was recovered in urine by 24 h post injection. The highest absorbed doses were received by the urinary bladder wall, the thyroid, the upper large intestine, the lower large intestine and the uterus. The estimated mean effective dose for the adult subject, taking into account the weight factors of the ICRP60 publication, was 0.0083 mSv/MBq. The amount of Tc-99m ciprofloxacin required for adequate planar and tomographic imaging results in an acceptable effective dose to the patient.

ET-1 is overexpressed by human cancers in vivo and in vitro and may be mitogenic for cancer cells. Method-To elucidate if ET-1 is a growth regulator the following were investigated in human colorectal cancer cell lines (LIM1215 and HT29): ET-1 production by ELISA; ET receptor expression using radioligand autoradiographic techniques; and responsiveness to ET-1, and to ETA and ETB antagonism by growth measurements. Results-ET-1 was produced by LIM1215 and HT29 cells (21.3 and 41.7 fmol/ml/10(6) cells (24 hours); 22.6 and 71.7 fmol/ml/10(6) cells (48 hours), respectively). ETA and ETB receptors were expressed by both cell lines. Addition of ET-1 resulted in a dose dependent increase in cell numbers which was significant at 10(-8)-10(-9) M for LIM1215, with the greatest increase at 10(-8) M (32.7% and 28.4% increase above controls at 48 hours and 72 hours; p<0.05) and at 10(-8)-10(-9) M for HT29, with the greatest increase at 10(-9) M (13.4% and 15.7% increase above controls at 48 hours and 72 hours; p<0.05). ETA antagonists BQ123 and BQ610, but not the ETB antagonist BQ788, inhibited ET-1 induced proliferation of both LIM1215 and HT29 (p<0.05). Conclusion-ET-1 can stimulate the proliferation of colorectal cancer cell lines via the ETA, but not the ETB, receptor.

There is strong evidence that I-1-binding sites, located in the rostro-ventrolateral medulla, are involved in regulation of blood pressure. However, less is known about the peripheral participation of I-1-binding sites in cardiovascular reactions. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether specific imidazoline derivatives influence myocardial contractility and whether imidazoline binding sites are expressed in rat heart. Agmatine, clonidine and idazoxan failed to alter inotropy in left atria within the whole concentration range tested (1 nM- 100 mu M). whereas cirazoline (1-100 mu M) and moxonidine (100 mu M) increase inotropy by about 20-30%. After preincubation with the alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonist prazosin, the cirazoline and moxonidine stimulated inotropy was antagonized, indicating more an alpha(1)-adrenergic and less an imidazoline binding site mediated mechanism. Radioligand-binding studies in membranes of left ventricles using [H-3]-clonidine to specify I-1-binding yielded K-D values of 12.7 mu M, confirming the functional results of an absence of I-1-binding sites in ventricles of rats. However, the existence of low affinity I-2-binding sites determined by [H-3]-idazoxan labeling could not be excluded since a K-D of 0.5 mu M was calculated and since competition studies with guanabenz (K-i = 0.1 mu M), clonidine (K-i = 58.1 mu M) and moxonidine (K-i = 129 mu M) confirmed the specificity of the I-2-binding.

Biodistribution studies showed that the carbon-fluorine bond was stable in vivo, that this compound was able to cross the blood-brain barrier, and that a general diffusion equilibrium could account for the availability of the tracer. The great quantity of highly polar metabolites found in plasma did not contribute to the small amounts of metabolites found in hippocampus, frontal cortex, and cerebellum. Ex vivo p-[F-18]MPPF and in vitro 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-[H-3]propylamino)tetralin autoradiography were compared both qualitatively and quantitatively. Qualitative evaluation proved that the same brain regions were labeled and that the p-[F-18]MPPF labeling is (a) in total agreement with the known distribution of 5-HT1A receptors in rats and (b) characterized by very low nonspecific binding. Quantitative comparison demonstrated that the in vivo labeling pattern obtained with p-[F-18]MPPF cannot be explained by differences in regional blood flow, capillary density, or permeability. The 5-HT1A specificity of p-[F-18]MPPF and binding reversibility were confirmed in vivo with displacement experiments. Thus, this compound can be used to evaluate parameters characterizing 5-HT1A binding sites in the brain.

The motilin receptor has not been cloned yet, but motilin-receptor agonists appear to be potent prokinetic agents for the treatment of dysmotility disorders. The aim of this study was to determine neural or muscular localization of motilin receptors in human upper gastrointestinal tract and to investigate their pharmacological characteristics. The binding of I-125- labeled motilin to tissue membranes prepared from human stomach and duodenum was studied; rabbit tissues were used for comparison. Solutions enriched in neural synaptosomes or in smooth muscle plasma membranes were obtained. Various motilin analogs were used to displace the motilin radioligand from the various tissue membranes. The highest concentration of human motilin receptors was found in the antrum, predominantly in the neural preparation. Human motilin receptors were sensitive to the NH2-terminal portion of the motilin molecule, but comparison with rabbit showed that both species had specific affinities for various motilin analogs [i.e., Mot-(1-9), Mot-(1-12), Mot-(1-12) (CH2NH)(10-11), and erythromycin]. Motilin receptors obtained from synaptosomes or muscular plasma membranes of human antrum expressed different affinity for two motilin-receptor agonists, Mot-(1-12) and Mot-(1-12) (CH2NH)(10-11), suggesting that they correspond to specific receptor subtypes. We conclude that human motilin receptors are located predominantly in nerves of the antral wall, are functionally (and probably structurally) different from those found in other species such as the rabbit, and express specific functional (and probably structural) characteristics dependent on their localization on antral nerves or muscles, suggesting the existence of specific receptor subtypes, potentially of significant physiological or pharmacological relevance.

Objectives To evaluate phosphodiesterase 10A PET imaging as a biomarker of HD progression using the radioligand, [F-18]MNI-659. Methods The cross-sectional study (NCT02061722) included 45 Huntington's disease gene-expansion carriers stratified into four disease stages (early and late premanifest and Huntington's disease stages 1 and 2) and 45 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. The primary analysis compared striatal and pallidal phosphodiesterase 10A availability between Huntington's disease gene-expansion carriers and healthy controls as assessed by [F-18]MNI-659 binding. We assessed changes in phosphodiesterase 10A expression using several PET methodologies and compared with previously proposed measures of Huntington's disease progression (PET imaging of D-2/3 receptors and anatomical volume loss on MRI). The longitudinal follow-up study (NCT02956148) continued evaluation of phosphodiesterase 10A availability in 35 Huntington's disease gene-expansion carriers at a mean of 18 months from baseline of the cross-sectional study. Results Primary analyses revealed that phosphodiesterase 10A availability in caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus was significantly lower in Huntington's disease gene-expansion carriers versus healthy controls across all stages. Striatal and pallidal phosphodiesterase 10A availability progressively declined in the premanifest stages and appeared to plateau between stages 1 and 2. The percentage decline of phosphodiesterase 10A availability measured cross-sectionally between Huntington's disease gene-expansion carriers and healthy controls was greater than that demonstrated by D-2/3 receptor availability or volumetric changes. Annualized rates of phosphodiesterase 10A change showed a statistically significant decline between the cross-sectional study and follow-up. Conclusions [F-18]MNI-659 PET imaging is a biologically plausible biomarker of Huntington's disease progression that is more sensitive than the dopamine-receptor and volumetric methods currently used.

A live cell NanoBRET binding assay allows the study of ligand-binding kinetics to the adenosine A<sub>3</sub> receptor	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Adenosine A(3) receptor; Binding kinetics; Residence time; NanoBRET	TARGET RESIDENCE TIME; ANTAGONIST-RADIOLIGAND; HIGHLY POTENT; AFFINITY; DERIVATIVES; DISSOCIATION; MECHANISMS; DISCOVERY; SUBTYPES; AGONISTS	There is a growing interest in understanding the binding kinetics of compounds that bind to G protein-coupled receptors prior to progressing a lead compound into clinical trials. The widely expressed adenosine A(3) receptor (A(3)AR) has been implicated in a range of diseases including immune conditions, and compounds that aim to selectively target this receptor are currently under development for arthritis. Kinetic studies at the A(3)AR have been performed using a radiolabelled antagonist, but due to the kinetics of this probe, they have been carried out at 10 degrees C in membrane preparations. In this study, we have developed a live cell NanoBRET ligand binding assay using fluorescent A(3)AR antagonists to measure kinetic parameters of labelled and unlabelled compounds at the A(3)AR at physiological temperatures. The kinetic profiles of four fluorescent antagonists were determined in kinetic association assays, and it was found that XAC-ser-tyr-X-BY630 had the longest residence time (RT=288 +/- 62min) at the A(3)AR. The association and dissociation rate constants of three antagonists PSB-11, compound 5, and LUF7565 were also determined using two fluorescent ligands (XAC-ser-tyr-X-BY630 or AV039, RT=6.8 +/- 0.8min) as the labelled probe and compared to those obtained using a radiolabelled antagonist ([H-3]PSB-11, RT=44.6 +/- 3.9min). There was close agreement in the kinetic parameters measured with AV039 and [H-3]PSB-11 but significant differences to those obtained using XAC-S-ser-S-tyr-X-BY630. These data indicate that selecting a probe with the appropriate kinetics is important to accurately determine the kinetics of unlabelled ligands with markedly different kinetic profiles.

Effect of overnight smoking abstinence on a marker for microglial activation: a [<SUP>11</SUP>C]DAA1106 positron emission tomography study	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Tobacco dependence; Cigarette withdrawal; Positron emission tomography; Magnetic resonance imaging; [C-11]DAA1106; Microglial activation; Neuroinflammation	PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTOR; NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN TSPO; MENTHOL CIGARETTE SMOKERS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; INCREASED BINDING; DOPAMINE RELEASE; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; HIGH-AFFINITY; NEUROINFLAMMATION	RationaleMicroglia are the main immune cells in the central nervous system and participate in neuroinflammation. When activated, microglia express increased levels of the translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO), thereby making TSPO availability a marker for neuroinflammation. Using positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, our group recently demonstrated that smokers in the satiated state had 16.8% less binding of the radiotracer [C-11]DAA1106 (a radioligand for TSPO) in the brain than nonsmokers.ObjectivesWe sought to determine the effect of overnight smoking abstinence on [C-11]DAA1106 binding in the brain.MethodsForty participants (22 smokers and 18 nonsmokers) completed the study (at one of two sites) and had usable data, which included images from a dynamic [C-11]DAA1106 PET scanning session (with smokers having been abstinent for 17.92.3h) and a blood sample for TSPO genotyping. Whole brain standardized uptake values (SUVs) were determined, and analysis of variance was performed, with group (overnight abstinent smoker vs. nonsmoker), site, and TSPO genotype as factors, thereby controlling for site and genotype.ResultsOvernight abstinent smokers had lower whole brain SUVs (by 15.5 and 17.0% for the two study sites) than nonsmokers (ANCOVA, P=0.004). The groups did not significantly differ in injected radiotracer dose or body weight, which were used to calculate SUV.Conclusions p id=Par5 These results in overnight abstinent smokers are similar to those in satiated smokers, indicating that chronic cigarette smoking leads to global impairment of microglial activation which persists into early abstinence. Other explanations for study results, such as smoking leading to reduced numbers of microglia or smokers having more rapid metabolism of the radiotracer than nonsmokers, are also possible.

Pharmacological characterization of novel synthetic opioids (NSO) found in the recreational drug marketplace	NEUROPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Analgesia; Butyrylfentanyl; Mu-opioid receptor; MT-45; U-47700	MOR-1 SPLICE VARIANTS; ANALGESIC ACTIVITY; FENTANYL ANALOGS; RECEPTOR MOR-1; BINDING; MT-45; INCREASES; MEDIATION; MORPHINE; U-47700	Novel synthetic opioids (NSO) are increasingly encountered in illicit heroin and counterfeit pain pills. Many NSO are resurrected from older biomedical literature or patent applications, so limited information is available about their biological effects. Here we examined the pharmacology of three structurally distinct NSO found in the recreational drug market: N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)-N-phenylbutyramide (butyrylfentanyl), 3,4-dichloro-N-[(1R,2R)-2-(dimethylamino)cyclohexyl]-N-methylbenzamide (U-47700) and l-cyclohexyl-4-(1,2-diphenylethyl)piperazine (MT-45). Radioligand binding and GTP gamma S functional assays were carried out in cells transfected with murine mu- (MOR-1), delta- (DOR1) or kappa-opioid receptors (KOR-1). Antinociceptive effects were determined using the radiant heat tail flick technique in mice, and opioid specificity was assessed with the mu-opioid antagonist naloxone. Butyrylfentanyl, U-47700 and MT-45 displayed nM affinities at MOR-1, but were less potent than morphine, and had much weaker effects at DOR-1 and KOR-1. All NSO exhibited agonist actions at MOR-1 in the GTP gamma S assay. Butyrylfentanyl and U-47700 were 31- and 12-fold more potent than morphine in the tail flick assay, whereas MT-45 was equipotent with morphine. Analgesic effects were reversed by naloxone and absent in genetically-engineered mice lacking MOR-1. Our findings confirm that butyrylfentanyl, U-47700 and MT-45 are selective MOR-1 agonists with in vitro affinities less than morphine. However, analgesic potencies vary more than 30-fold across the compounds, and in vitro binding affinity does not predict in vivo potency. Taken together, our findings highlight the risks to humans who may unknowingly be exposed to these and other NSO when taking adulterated heroin or counterfeit pain medications.

In this study. we investigated the expression of beta-ARs, individual receptor subtypes, and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) regulatory proteins in livers from aging rats. Radioligand-binding studies demonstrated that beta-AR density increased by greater than threefold in hepatocyte membranes from senescent (24-mo-old) compared with young adult (7-mo-old) rats and that this phenomenon was blocked by food restriction, which is known to retard aging processes in rodents. Competition-binding studies revealed a mixed population of beta(1)- and beta(2)-AR subtypes in liver membranes over the adult life span. with a trend for greater beta(2)-AR density with age. Expression of both beta-AR subtype mRNAs in rat liver increased with age, whereas beta(2)- but not beta(1)-AR protein levels declined in livers of old animals. Immunoreactive beta(2)- but not beta(1)-ARs were preferentially distributed in pericentral hepatic regions. Levels of GRK2/3 and beta-arrestin 2 proteins, which are involved in downregulation of agonist-activated GPCRs, including beta-ARs, increased during aging. Insofar as sympathetic tone increases with age, our findings suggest that, despite enhanced agonist-mediated downregulation of hepatic beta-ARs preferentially affecting the beta(2)-AR subtype. increased generation of both receptor subtypes during aging augments the pool of plasma membrane-bound beta-ARs coupled to AC in hepatocytes. This study thus identifies one or both beta-AR subtypes as possible therapeutic targets involved in aberrant hepatic processes of glucose and lipid metabolism during aging.

However, synthesizing GPCRs in vitro can be challenging. Recently, some cell-free protein synthesis systems have been shown to produce a large amount of membrane protein combined with chemical chaperones that include liposomes and glycerol. Liposomes containing high concentrations of glycerol are known as glycerosomes, which are used in new drug delivery systems. Glycerosomes have greater morphological stability than liposomes. Proteoglycerosomes are defined as glycerosomes that contain membrane proteins. Human histamine H1 receptor (HRH1) is one of the most studied GPCRs. In this study, we synthesized wild-type HRH1 (WT-HRH1) proteoglycerosomes and D107A-HRH1, (in which Asp107 was replaced by Ala) in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system combined with asolectin glycerosomes. The mutant HRH1 has been reported to have low affinity for the H1 antagonist. In this study, the amount of synthesized WT-HRH1 in one synthesis reaction was 434 +/- 66.6 mu g (7.75 +/- 1.19 x 10(3) pmol). The specific binding of [H-3]pyrilamine to the WT-HRH1 proteoglycerosomes became saturated as the concentration of the radioligand increased. The dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum density (Bmax) of the synthesized WT-HRH1 were 9.76 +/- 1.25 nM and 21.4 +/- 0.936 pmol/mg protein, respectively. However, specific binding to D107A-HRH1 was reduced compared with WT-HRH1 and the binding did not become saturated. The findings of this study highlight that HRH1 synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system combined with glycerosomes has the ability to bind to H-1 antagonists.

Influence of chronic L-DOPA treatment on immune response following allogeneic and xenogeneic graft in a rat model of Parkinson's disease	BRAIN BEHAVIOR AND IMMUNITY			English	Article						Parkinson's disease; L-DOPA; Transplant; Stem cell; Dyskinesia; Immune response	PERIPHERAL-BLOOD LYMPHOCYTES; VENTRAL MESENCEPHALIC GRAFTS; ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING ASSAY; INDUCED DYSKINESIA; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; RECEPTOR SUBTYPES; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; 6-OHDA LESIONS; MOTOR FUNCTION	Although intrastriatal transplantation of fetal cells for the treatment of Parkinson's disease had shown encouraging results in initial open-label clinical trials, subsequent double-blind studies reported more debatable outcomes. These studies highlighted the need for greater preclinical analysis of the parameters that may influence the success of cell therapy. While much of this has focused on the cells and location of the transplants, few have attempted to replicate potentially critical patient centered factors. Of particular relevance is that patients will be under continued L-DOPA treatment prior to and following transplantation, and that typically the grafts will not be immunologically compatible with the host. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the effect of chronic L-DOPA administered during different phases of the transplantation process on the survival and function of grafts with differing degrees of immunological compatibility. To that end, unilaterally 6-OHDA lesioned rats received sham surgery, allogeneic or xenogeneic transplants, while being treated with L-DOPA before and/or after transplantation. Irrespective of the L-DOPA treatment, dopaminergic grafts improved function and reduced the onset of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia. Importantly, although L-DOPA administered post transplantation was found to have no detrimental effect on graft survival, it did significantly promote the immune response around xenogeneic transplants, despite the administration of immunosuppressive treatment (cyclosporine).

However, human data corroborating this association remains scarce. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of hormone replacement therapy on 5-HT1A receptor binding in postmenopausal women using positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]MAY-100635. In this randomized, double-blind, longitudinal study, 30 postmenopausal women underwent treatment with either a combination of oral 17 beta-estradiol valerate and micronized progesterone (group 1, n = 10), oral 17 beta-estradiol valerate (group 2, n = 10), or placebo (group 3, n = 10). Two PET measurements were performed, one the day before treatment start and the second after at least eight weeks of treatment. Plasma levels of estradiol (E-2) progesterone (P-4), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were collected prior to PET measurements. As expected, hormone replacement therapy led to a significant increase in E-2 and P-4 plasma levels in group 1 and to a significant increase in E-2 levels in group 2. The 5-HT1A receptor binding did not change significantly after estrogen, combined estrogen/progesterone treatment or placebo in any of the investigated brain regions. There were no significant correlations between changes in E-2 or P-4 values and changes in 5-HT1A receptor binding. Although we were not able to confirm effects of gonadal hormone treatment on 5-HT1A receptor binding, our data do not preclude associations between sex steroid levels and serotonin, the neurotransmitter implicated most strongly in the pathogenesis of affective and anxiety disorders.

Molecular Interactions between Mecamylamine Enantiomers and the Transmembrane Domain of the Human α4β2 Nicotinic Receptor	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							TRICYCLIC ANTIDEPRESSANTS; ACETYLCHOLINE; BINDING; ANTAGONISTS; SITES	To characterize the binding sites of mecamylamine enantiomers on the transmembrane domain (TMD) of human (h) (alpha 4)(3)(beta 2)(2) and (alpha 4)(2)(beta 2)(3) nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), we used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular docking, and radioligand binding approaches. The interactions of (S)-(+)- and (R)-(-)-mecamylamine with several residues, determined; by high-resolution NMR, within the h alpha 4 beta 2-TMD indicate different modes of binding at several luminal (L) and nonluminal (NL) sites. In general, the residues sensitive to each mecamylamine enantiomer are similar at both receptor stoichiometries. However, some differences were observed. The molecular docking experiments were crucial for delineating the location and orientation of each enantiomer in its binding site. In the (alpha 4)(2)(beta 2)(3)-TMD, (S)-(+)-mecamylamine interacts with the L1 (i.e., between positions - 3' and -5') and L2 (i.e., between positions 16' and 20') sites, whereas the beta 2-intersubunit (i.e., cytoplasmic end of two beta 2-TMDs) and alpha 4/beta 2-intersubunit (i.e., cytoplasmic end of alpha 4-TM1 and beta-TM3) sites are shared by both enantiomers. In the (alpha 4)(3)(beta 2)(2-)TMD, both enantiomers bind with different orientations to the L1' (closer to ring 2') and alpha 4-intrasubunit (i.e., at the cytoplasmic ends of alpha 4-TM1 and alpha 4-TM2), sites, but only (R)-(-)-mecamylamine interacts with the L2' (i.e., closer to ring 20') and alpha 4-TM3-intrasubunit sites. Our findings are important because they provide, for the first time, a structural understanding of the allosteric modulation elicited by mecamylamine enantiomers at each h alpha 4 beta 2 stoichiometry. This advancement could be beneficial for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of several neurological disorders.

Central cleavage of beta-carotene yields 2 molecules of retinal followed by further oxidation to retinoic acid. Eccentric cleavage of beta-carotene occurs at double bonds other than the central double bond, and the products of these reactions are beta-apocarotenals and beta-apocarotenones. We reviewed recent developments in 3 areas: 1): the enzymatic production of beta-apocarotenoids in higher animals; 2) the occurrence of beta-apocarotenoids in foods and animal tissues; and 3) the biological activity of b-apocarotenoids, particularly on retinoid receptors. HPLC-mass spectrometry techniques were developed to quantify these compounds in mouse serum and tissues and in foods. beta-Apo-10'- and -12'- carotenals were detected in mouse serum and liver. beta-Apo-8'-, beta-apo-10'-, beta-apo-12'-, and beta-apo-14'- carotenals and beta-apo-13-carotenone were detected in orange-fleshed melons. Transactivation assays were performed to see whether apocarotenoids activate or antagonize retinoid X receptor (RXR) alpha. Reporter gene constructs and retinoid receptor (RXR alpha) were transfected into cells, which were used to perform quantitative assays for the activation of this ligand-dependent transcription factor. None of the beta-apocarotenoids significantly activated RXR alpha. However, beta-apo-13-carotenone antagonized the 9-cis-retinoic acid activation of RXR alpha. Competitive radioligand binding assays showed that this antagonist competes directly with the agonist for binding to purified receptor, a finding confirmed by molecular modeling studies. These findings suggest that a possible biological function of beta-apocarotenoids is their ability to interfere with nuclear receptor signaling. Recent work showed that beta-apo-13-carotenone is also a high-affinity antagonist of all 3 retinoic acid receptors (RAR alpha, RAR beta, and RAR gamma). Am J Clin Nutr 2012;96(suppl):1189S-92S.

Asymmetry of motor symptoms was defined by the difference between right- and left-sided scores for lateralized items assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Score in a series of 68 patients with Parkinson's disease (disease duration 2.1 +/- 1.5 years; Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Motor Score 22.7 +/- 9). Putaminal dopamine transporter availability was measured with the radioligand [I-123]beta-carboxymethyoxy-3 -beta-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([I-123]beta-CIT) and single photon emission computed tomography. We found that in the right-handed Parkinson's disease cohort, the number of patients who had lower dopamine transporter uptake in the left posterior putamen was significantly greater compared with those with lower uptake in the right posterior putamen (Parkinson's disease-left group, n = 49; Parkinson's disease-right group, n = 19; P < 0.001). In addition, one-way analysis of variance revealed significant reductions of mean total putaminal [I-123]beta-CIT binding of the Parkinson's disease-right patients compared with Parkinson's disease-left patients (P < 0.05).The preponderance of reduced left putaminal dopamine transporter availability strengthens clinical observations of a greater proportion of right-handed patients with Parkinson's disease with predominantly right-sided motor signs and argues against a randomly distributed asymmetric vulnerability of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons. The coexistence of a subgroup of right-handed patients with Parkinson's disease with more severe and predominant ipsilateral putaminal dopamine transporter decline suggests that asymmetry of dopaminergic denervation and motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease cannot be fully explained by hemispheric dominance alone, but that other factors must be involved.

GPCR structure and activation: an essential role for the first extracellular loop in activating the adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> receptor	FASEB JOURNAL			English	Article						mutagenesis; G protein-coupled receptors; S. cerevisiae; receptor activation; constitutive activity	DOMINANT RETINITIS-PIGMENTOSA; PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; LIGAND-BINDING; C5A RECEPTOR; BETA-2-ADRENERGIC RECEPTOR; THYROTROPIN RECEPTOR; RANDOM MUTAGENESIS; RHODOPSIN GENE; YEAST; IDENTIFICATION	The highly variable extracellular loops in G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have been implicated in receptor activation, the mechanism of which is poorly understood. In a random mutagenesis screen on the human adenosine A(2B) receptor (A(2B)R) using the MMY24 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain as a read-out system, we found that two residues in the first extracellular loop, a phenylalanine and an aspartic acid at positions 71 and 74, respectively, are involved in receptor activation. We subsequently performed further site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis. These experiments revealed that the introduction of mutations at either of the identified positions results in a wide variety of receptor activation profiles, with changes in agonist potency, constitutive activity, and intrinsic activity. Radioligand binding studies showed that the changes in activation were not due to changes in receptor expression. We interpret these data in the light of the recently revealed structure of the adenosine A(2A)R, the closest homologue of the A(2B)R. The two residues are suggested to be vital in maintaining the tertiary structure of a beta sheet in the extracellular domain of the A(2B)R. We hypothesize that deterioration of structure in the extracellular domains of GPCRs compromises overall receptor structure with profound consequences for receptor activation and constitutive activity.-Peeters, M.

Moreover, this study needs to perform the role of GRK2 (beta ARK1) and beta-arrestin1 on this internalization of Asp104Lys mutant of beta(1)-AR. Main methods: Binding affinity, functional potency of agonist and agonist-induced internalization were determined for wild type and both mutants of beta(1)-ARs stably expressed in HEK 293 cells as assessed by [H-3] CGP12177 radioligand. We have performed GRK2 and beta-arrestin1 expression levels by western blot analysis and also performed internalization of this mutant receptor after over expression and deletion of beta-arrestin1 gene. Key findings: In the present study, the binding affinity of (-)-isoproterenol for both mutants were significantly decreased compared to wild type. Though the mutant Asp104Ala showed agonist-induced receptor activation, interestingly this mutant was not internalized. However, the mutant Asp104Lys, which showed uncoupling with G protein, was internalized 31.77 +/- 3.13% from cell surface. Asp104Lys mutant produced the same level of GRK2 expression in (-)-isoproterenol induced stimulation of wild type receptor and addition of (-)-isoproterenol further increased GRK2 expression in mutant receptors. In addition, overexpression of beta-arrestin1 in mutant Asp104Lys promoted (39.75 +/- 2.19%) and knockdown of beta-arrestin1 by siRNA decreased (3.55 +/- 1.75%) internalization compared to Asp104Lys mutant of beta(1)-ARs. Significance: The present studies suggest that Asp104Lys mutant beta(1)-ARs triggers unconventional homologous internalization induced by G protein independent signals, where GRK2 and beta-arrestin1 play an important role for beta(1)-AR internalization.

On the basis of the key role of the central opioidergic system in addiction and substance abuse, we investigated the relationship between certain personality traits that are supposed to be relevant in addiction and the opioid receptor status in healthy subjects. Methods: We investigated 23 healthy male volunteers who were extensively clinically tested to exclude substance abuse. All of the subjects underwent 1 PET scan with the subtype-nonselective opioidergic radioligand F-18-fluoroethyl-diprenorphine under resting conditions without sensory or cognitive stimulation. Subsequently, the subjects were psychologically tested for the personality traits novelty seeking, harm avoidance, reward dependence, and persistence, according to Cloninger's biosocial model of personality. The binding potential (BP) as a parameter of regional cerebral opioid receptor availability was computed by means of the modified Logan plot using the occipital cortex as a reference region. Further imaging data analysis was performed using statistical parametric mapping; after stereotactic normalization, the correlations were calculated between the regional BP and the psychologic scores on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Results: The correlation analysis between personality dimensions and opioid receptor availability showed a significant (P < 0.001) positive correlation between the scores of reward dependence and the BP of the bilateral ventral striatum with nucleus accumbens (z scores, 4.52 and 4.33, respectively). The additionally performed region-of-interest-based correlation analysis yielded correlation coefficients of r = 0.84 and r = 0.81 for the left and right ventral striata, respectively. No further significant correlations were detectable between the other personality dimensions and cerebral opioid receptor binding. Conclusion: In healthy subjects, personality traits, which might be predisposing for addictive behavior, are correlated to the opioidergic neurotransmission in core structures of the human reward system.

We have recently designed three URP analogs [D-Trp(4)]URP, [Orn(5)] URP and [D-Tyr(6)]URP, that act as UT antagonists in the rat aortic ring bioassay. However, it has been previously reported that UII/URP analogs capable of inhibiting the contractile activity of UII possess agonistic activity on UT-transfected cells. In the present study, we have compared the ability of URP analogs to compete for [I-125]URP binding and to modulate cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+](c)) in cultured rat astrocytes. All three analogs displaced radioligand binding: [D-Trp4]URP and [D-Tyr(6)]URP interacted with high-and low-affinity sites whereas [Orn(5)]URP only bound high-affinity sites. [D-Trp(4)]URP and [D-Tyr (6)] URP both induced a robust increase in [Ca2+]c in astrocytes while [Orn(5)]URP was totally devoid of activity. [Orn(5)]URP provoked a concentration-dependent inhibition of URP- and UII-evoked [Ca2+](c) increase and a rightward shift of the URP and UII dose-response curves. The present data indicate that [D-Trp(4)] URP and [D-Tyr 6] URP, which act as UII antagonists in the rat aortic ring assay, behave as agonists in the [Ca2+]c mobilization assay in cultured astrocytes, whereas [Orn(5)]URP is a pure selective antagonist in both rat aortic ring contraction and astrocyte [Ca2+](c) mobilization assays.

PK11195, the reference compound for PBR, is used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging but has a limited capacity to quantify PBR expression. Here we describe the new PBR ligand CLINME as an alternative to PK11195. In vitro and in vivo imaging properties of [C-11]CLINME were studied in a rat model of local acute neuroinflammation, and compared with the reference compound [C-11]PK11195, using autoradiography and PET imaging. Immunohistochemistry study was performed to validate the imaging data. [C-11]CLINME exhibited a higher contrast between the PBR-expressing lesion site and the intact side of the same rat brain than [C-11]PK11195 (2.14 +/- 0.09 vs. 1.62 +/- 0.05 fold increase respectively). The difference was due to a lower uptake for [C-11]CLINME than for [C-11]PK11195 in the non-inflammatory part of the brain in which PBR was not expressed, while uptake levels in the lesion were similar for both tracers. Tracer localization correlated well with that of activated microglial cells, demonstrated by immunohistochemistry and PBR expression detected by autoradiography. Modeling using the simplified tissue reference model showed that R-1 was similar for both ligands (R-1 similar to 1), with [C-11]CLINME exhibiting a higher binding potential than [C-11]PK11195 (1.07 +/- 0.30 vs. 0.66 +/- 0.15). The results show that [C-11]CLINME performs better than [C-11]PK11195 in this model. Further studies of this new compound should be carried out to better define its capacity to overcome the limitations of [C-11]PK11195 for PBR PET imaging. (C) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Neuroimaging of the serotonin Reuptake site requires high-affinity Ligands	SYNAPSE			English	Article						SSRI; rat and monkey brain; species differences; homogenate binding; reference region	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; TEST-RETEST REPRODUCIBILITY; HUMAN-BRAIN; IN-VITRO; TRANSPORTER BINDING; H-3 PAROXETINE; MONKEY BRAIN; CITALOPRAM BINDING; PET; C-11	Numerous attempts have been made to develop suitable radiolabeled tracers for positron emission tomography or single photon emission computed tomography imaging of the serotonin transporter (SERT), but most often, negative outcomes are reported. The aim of this study is to define characteristics of a good SERT radioligand and to investigate species differences. We examined seven different selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and that except for one all have been previously tested as emission tomography ligands. The outcome of the ligands as emission tomography tracers was compared in relation with receptor density (B-max) and/or ligand affinity (K-d) in rat and monkey cerebrum and cerebellum (reference region) membranes. [H-3]-(S)-Citalopram and [H-3]-(+)-McN5652 display statistically significantly lower affinity, whereas [H-3]paroxetine displays statistically significantly higher affinity for SERT in monkey cortex when compared with the rat cerebrum. The affinity of [H-3]MADAM, [I-123]ADAM, and [C-11]DASB for SERT obtained with rat cerebrum and monkey cortex are similar. In monkey cortex, Kd and B-max could not be determined with [H-3]fluoxetine. Of the seven SSRIs, [H-3]-(S)-citalopram, [H-3]MADAM, and [C-11]DASB displayed significant specific binding to SERT in monkey cerebellum, with Bmax cortex:cerebellum ratios being 17, 3, and 4, respectively. In rat brain tissue the ratios were 12, 6, and 3, respectively. In conclusion, it can be estimated that imaging of the human SERT in a high-density region requires radioligands with Kd values between 0.03 and a maximum of 0.3 nM (at 37 degrees C). The differential specific cerebellar binding raises the question of the suitability of cerebellum as a reference region for nonspecific binding.

Experimental approach: Postmortem stability of [S-35]TBPS binding was assessed in rat brain samples harvested at various times after death and the binding properties of [S-35]TBPS binding ( K-D and B-max) were determined in human postmortem brain using radioligand binding studies. In addition, the ability of human brain [S-35]TBPS binding to be allosterically modulated by compounds that bind at recognition sites distinct from the convulsant binding site was measured. Key results: Whereas binding of [H-3] Ro 15-1788 to the benzodiazepine binding site and [H-3] muscimol to the agonist ( GABA) binding site were retained over a 20 h postmortem interval, there was a significant decrease in the affinity and number of [S-35]TBPS binding sites. Nevertheless, [S-35]TBPS binding in human brain could be inhibited by TBPS, picrotoxin, loreclezole and pentobarbital and modulated by GABA with potencies comparable to those observed in rats. In addition, the GAB(A)-induced reduction in human brain [S-35]TBPS binding could be modulated by benzodiazepine site ligands in a manner that reflected their intrinsic efficacies. Conclusions and implications: These results suggest that allosteric coupling between the [S-35 ]TBPS, GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites is preserved in postmortem human brain and that [S-35]TBPS binding in this tissue may be used to study functional characteristics of native human GABA(A) receptors.

MLT and HLT rats were assigned to swim for 6 days per week for total of 6 weeks. All rats were sacrificed 36 h after their last training session. Splenocytes were pooled for assay of cell proliferation and neuropeptide contents in the hypothalamus, hypophysis and plasma were determined by radioimmunoassay while glucocorticoid specific binding in intact thymus was measured by radioligand binding assay. All rats were weighed weekly. The results showed that after 6-week training, rat splenocyte proliferation in response to Con A and LPS decreased in HLT. rats compared with, MLT and CCG rats. In, addition, the contents of beta-endorphin, dynorphin A, arginine vasopressin and oxytocin in the hypothalamus, hypophysis and plasma were altered by HLT, as shown by increased plasma concentration of glucocorticoids and decreased glucocorticoids specific binding in intact thymus compared with MLT and CCG. Furthermore, a decreased body mass in HLT rats has been observed. The body mass of HLT rats was significantly lower than that in CCG and MLT rats at the end of the swimming training period. These data suggest that 6-week heavy load training induces the dysfunction of immunity and neuroendocrine responses, which might be one of the underlying mechanisms of immune dysfunction in overtraining.

However, reversibility of these neurotoxic effects still remains unclear. To address this question, PET was performed using the serotonin transporter (SERT) ligand C-11-(+)-McN5652 in a total of 117 subjects subdivided into 4 groups: actual ecstasy users (n = 30), former ecstasy users (n = 29), drug-naive control subjects (n = 29), and subjects with abuse of psychoactive agents other than ecstasy (n = 29). Methods: About 500 MBq C-11-(+)-McN5652 were injected intravenously. Thirty-five scans were acquired according to a dynamic scan protocol of 90 min using a full-ring whole-body PET system. Transaxial slices were reconstructed using an iterative method. Individual brains were transformed to a template defined earlier. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were derived by application of a reference tissue approach for reversible binding. Gray matter of the cerebellum served as reference. SERT-rich brain regions-mesencephalon, putamen, caudate, and thalamus-were selected for the evaluation of SERT availability using volumes of interest predefined in the template. Results: Compared with drug-naive control subjects, the DVR in actual ecstasy users was significantly reduced in the mesencephalon (P = 0.004) and the thalamus (P = 0.044). The DVR in former ecstasy users was very close to the DVR in drug-naive control subjects in all brain regions. The DVR in polydrug users was slightly higher than that in the drug-naive control subjects in all SERT-rich regions (not statistically significant). Conclusion: Our findings further support the hypothesis of ecstasy-induced protracted alterations of the SERT. In addition, they might indicate reversibility of the availability of SERT as measured by PET. However, this does not imply full reversibility of the neurotoxic effects.

This may modulate 5HT bioavailability in the myometrium. Because 5HT is an important endogenous uterotonic compound, it has been postulated that this effect of OT may contribute to its potency as a labor inducer. This also predicts the presence of oxytocin receptors (OTRs) and transducing signals that will interact with 5HT transporters (SERT) in mast cells. In this study, OTR and SERT were characterized in murine peritoneal mast cells by radioligand-binding studies. Saturation assays for OTR showed no changes in K(d) along the estrous cycle (6.95 +/- 2.76 nM in estrus and 4.07 +/- 1.73 nM in diestrus) but an increase in B(max) in estrus (0.71 +/- 0.08 pmol/10(6) cells and 0.37 +/- 0.05 pmol/10(6) cells in estrus and diestrus, respectively). B(max) and K(d) for SERT were not affected along the estrous cycle. The signaling between the OTR and the SERT was analyzed by measuring the extent of inhibition of OT and PMA (activator of protein kinase C on 5HT uptake and the capability of Ro318220 (specific inhibitor of PKC) to increase 5HT uptake and block the effect of the above compounds in mast cells. The results showed that in murine peritoneal mast cells in vitro (1) ovarian hormones modulate OTR but not SERT expression, (2) the magnitude of OT action on 5HT uptake depends on the number of OTRs expressed in mast cells, and (3) the signaling between OTR and the SERT is mediated through the activation of protein kinase C. it is concluded that the ovarian hormones have a modulatory action on 5HT uptake which involves OT-mediated mechanism.

To gain insight into this phenomenon, we investigated the identity and distribution of NT1 receptor proteins in the brain of 10-day-old rats by using two different NT1 antibodies: one (Abi3) directed against the third intracellular loop and the other (Abi4) against the C-terminus of the receptor. Immunoblot experiments that used Abi3 revealed the presence of two differentially glycosylated forms of the NT1 receptor in developing rat brain: one migrating at 54 and the other at 52 kDa. Whereas the 54-kDa form was expressed from birth to adulthood, the 52-kDa form was detected only at 10 and 15 days postnatal. Only the 52-kDa isoform was recognized by Abi4. By immunohistochemistry, both forms of the receptor were found to be predominantly expressed in cerebral cortex and dorsal hippocampus, in keeping with earlier radioligand binding and in situ hybridization data. However, whereas Abi4 immunoreactivity was mainly concentrated within nerve cell bodies and extensively colocalized with the Golgi marker a-mannosidase II, Abi3 immunoreactivity was predominantly located along neuronal processes. These results suggest that the transitorily expressed 52-kDa protein corresponds to an immature, incompletely glycosylated and largely intracellular form of the NT1 receptor and that the 54-kDa protein corresponds to a mature, fully glycosylated, and largely membrane-associated form. They also indicate that antibodies directed against different sequences of G-protein-coupled receptors may yield isoform-specific immunohistochemical labeling patterns in mammalian brain. Finally, the selective expression of the short form of the NT1 receptor early in development suggests that it may play a specific role in the establishment of neuronal circuitry. J. Comp.

The 5-HT1A/beta-adrenoceptor ligands (+/-)-pindolol, (-)-tertatolol, and (-)-penbutolol are currently under clinical investigation, and knowledge of their affinity at different populations of central 5-HT1A receptors is needed. Here we have determined the affinity of these drugs for presynaptic and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in postmortem human and rat brain using receptor autoradiography and the selective 5-HT1A radioligand [H-3]WAY-100635. The binding of [H-3]WAY-100635 was specific and saturable and showed high affinity in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus and hippocampus (K-D = 1.5-1.7 nM). In competition studies, the three compounds had nanomolar affinity and produced monophasic displacement of [H-3]WAY-100635 binding in all regions of both species. (-)-Penbutolol and (-)-tertatolol had similar affinity for pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors in both rat and human brain. However, in the human, but not the rat, the affinity of (+/-)-pindolol in dorsal raphe nucleus (K-i = 8.9 +/- 1.1 nM) was slightly but significantly higher than that in hippocampus (K-i = 14.4 +/- 1.5 n/M in CA1). In summary, our data show that (+/-)-pindolol, (-)-tertatolol, and (-)-penbutolol are all high-affinity ligands at native human and rat 5-HT1A receptors. (-)-Penbutolol and (-)-tertatolol do not discriminate between the pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A sites tested in either species, but (+/-)-pindolol showed a slightly higher affinity for the presynaptic site in human brain. Further work is needed to establish whether the latter difference is clinically relevant.

To explore its utility in binding to dopamine transporters, [H-3]PTT was synthesized and assayed for binding in rat striatal membranes and by in vitro autoradiography. In membranes, binding of [H-3]PTT was saturable to a single class of binding sites with a K-D value of 3 nM. The pharmacology of [H-3]PTT binding in striatal membranes was consistent with that of a ligand selective for dopamine transporters, with dopamine-selective compounds being significantly more potent in displacing [H-3]PTT binding than those for 5-HT or norepinephrine transporters. Although the ability of various transporter inhibitors to displace both [I-125]RTI-55 and [H-3]PTT binding correlated significantly with each other, there was a better correlation of inhibitor potencies versus [H-3]PTT binding and dopamine uptake than versus [I-125]RTI-55 binding and dopamine uptake. The differences in correlations were most noticeable for compounds relatively selective at the 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) transporter. The autoradiographic distribution of [H-3]PTT binding in coronal sections was consistent with the known distribution of the dopamine transporter, with high levels of binding evident in caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. Moderate densities of [H-3]PTT binding were also observed in substantia nigra pars compacta, and ventral tegmental area, as well as in the anterior cingulate cortex and portions of the hypothalamus. In addition, nonspecific binding was less than 5% of total binding. Thus, [H-3]PTT provides an accurate and convenient marker for the dopamine transporter.

Previous results in a rat lesion model of AD showed modulation of endocannabinoid receptor activity in the basalo-cortical pathway following a specific lesion of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs), indicating that the glial neuroinflammatory response accompanying the lesion is related to endocannabinoid signaling. In this study, 7 days after the lesion, decreased astrocyte and increased microglia immunoreactivities (GFAP and Iba-1) were observed, indicating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation. Using autoradio-graphic studies, the density and functional coupling to G-proteins of endocannabinoid receptor subtypes were studied in tissue sections from different brain areas where microglia density increased, using CB1 and CB2 selective agonists and antagonists. In the presence of the specific CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716A, [3H]CP55,940 binding (receptor density) was completely blocked in a dose-dependent manner, while the selective CB2 receptor antagonist, SR144528, inhibited binding to 25%, at best. [35S]GTP gamma S autoradiography (receptor coupling to G(i/0)-proteins) evoked by CP55,940 (CB1/CB2 agonist) and HU308 (more selective for CB2) was abolished by SR141716A in all areas, while SR144528 blocked up to 51.8% of the coupling to G(i/0)-proteins evoked by CP55,940 restricted to the nucleus basalis magnocellularis. Together, these results demonstrate that there are increased microglia and decreased astrocyte immunoreactivities 1 week after a specific deletion of BFCNs, which projects to cortical areas, where the CB1 receptor coupling to G(i/0)-proteins is upregulated. However, at the lesion site, the area with the highest neuroinflammatory response, there is also a limited contribution of CB2.

Specific and non-specific binding of a tracer for the translocator-specific protein in schizophrenia: an [11C]-PBR28 blocking study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						TSPO; Schizophrenia; Microglia; XBD173		Objective The mitochondrial 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) is expressed by activated microglia and positron emission tomography enables the measurement of TSPO levels in the brain. Findings in schizophrenia have shown to vary depending on the outcome measure used and this discrepancy in TSPO results could be explained by lower non-displaceable binding (V-ND) in schizophrenia, which could obscure increases in specific binding. In this study, we have used the TSPO ligand XBD173 to block the TSPO radioligand [C-11]-PBR28 and used an occupancy plot to quantify V-ND in patients with schizophrenia. Methods A total of 7 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia were recruited for this study. Each patient received two separate PET scans with [C-11]PBR28, one at baseline and one after the administration of the TSPO ligand XBD173. All patients were high-affinity binders (HABs) for the TSPO gene. We used an occupancy plot to quantify the non-displaceable component (V-ND) using 2TCM kinetic estimates with and without vascular correction. Finally we computed the V-ND at a single subject level using the SIME method. Results All patients showed a global and generalized reduction in [C-11]PBR28 uptake after the administration of XBD173. Constraining the V-ND to be equal for all patients, the population V-ND was estimated to be 1.99 mL/cm(3) (95% CI 1.90 to 2.08). When we used vascular correction, the fractional TSPO occupancy remained similar. Conclusions In schizophrenia patients, a substantial component of the [C-11]PBR28 signal represents specific binding to TSPO. Furthermore, the V-ND in patients with schizophrenia is similar to that previously reported in healthy controls. These results suggest that changes in non-specific binding between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls do not account for discrepant PET findings in this disorder.

We hypothesize higher amyloid levels among APOE epsilon 4 carriers vs APOE epsilon 4 noncarriers. Methods This is a cross-sectional study in a community-based sample of 249 middle-aged Hispanics in New York City who underwent a 3T brain MRI and PET with the amyloid radioligand F-18-florbetaben. APOE genotype was the primary exposure. The primary outcome was amyloid positivity. The secondary outcome was subthreshold amyloid levels examined as a continuous variable. Results APOE epsilon 4 carriers (n = 85) had a higher frequency (15.3%) of amyloid positivity compared to APOE epsilon 4 noncarriers (n = 164, 1.8%). In the subthreshold group of amyloid-negative participants (n = 233), APOE epsilon 4 carriers (n = 72) had a 0.02 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01-0.04) higher global brain amyloid standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) compared to APOE epsilon 4 noncarriers (n = 161). Compared to participants with the epsilon 3/epsilon 3 genotype, participants with epsilon 4/epsilon 4 had the highest frequency of amyloid positivity (28.6%), followed by those with epsilon 3/epsilon 4 (11%). Among amyloid-negative participants (n = 233), compared to participants with epsilon 3/epsilon 3 (n = 134), those with epsilon 4/epsilon 4 (n = 5) had a 0.12 (95% CI 0.07-0.17) higher global brain amyloid SUVR, and those with epsilon 3/epsilon 4 had a 0.02 higher SUVR (95% CI 0.003-0.04). Results were similar when a median split was used for elevated amyloid, when continuous amyloid SUVR was analyzed in all participants, and in nonparametric Mann-Whitney comparisons. Conclusion Middle-aged Hispanic APOE epsilon 4 carriers have higher in vivo brain amyloid burden compared with noncarriers, as reported in non-Hispanics.

Osteopontin/secreted phosphoprotein-1 behaves as a molecular brake regulating the neuroinflammatory response to chronic viral infection	JOURNAL OF NEUROINFLAMMATION			English	Article						Neuroimaging; Neuroinflammation; Microglial activation; DPA-713; Purkinje cells; Human immunodeficiency virus type-1; Peripheral benzodiazepine receptor; Positron emission tomography; RNAscope; Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1	PROGRESSIVE HIV-1 INFECTION; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MICE LACKING; BRAIN; MICROGLIA; PET; EXPRESSION; PATHOGENESIS; MACROPHAGES; ACTIVATION	Background Osteopontin (OPN) as a secreted signaling protein is dramatically induced in response to cellular injury and neurodegeneration. Microglial inflammatory responses in the brain are tightly associated with the neuropathologic hallmarks of neurodegenerative disease, but understanding of the molecular mechanisms remains in several contexts poorly understood. Methods Micro-positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging using radioligands to detect increased expression of the translocator protein (TSPO) receptor in the brain is a non-invasive tool used to track neuroinflammation in living mammals. Results In humanized, chronically HIV-infected female mice in which OPN expression was knocked down with functional aptamers, uptake of TSPO radioligand DPA-713 was markedly upregulated in the cortex, olfactory bulb, basal forebrain, hypothalamus, and central grey matter compared to controls. Microglia immunoreactive for Iba-1 were more abundant in some HIV-infected mice, but overall, the differences were not significant between groups. TSPO(+)microglia were readily detected by immunolabeling of post-mortem brain tissue and unexpectedly, two types of neurons also selectively stained positive for TSPO. The reactive cells were the specialized neurons of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, and a subset of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons of the substantia nigra. Conclusions In female mice with wild-type levels of osteopontin, increased levels of TSPO ligand uptake in the brain was seen in animals with the highest levels of persistent HIV replication. In contrast, in mice with lower levels of osteopontin, the highest levels of TSPO uptake was seen, in mice with relatively low levels of persistent infection. These findings suggest that osteopontin may act as a molecular brake regulating in the brain, the inflammatory response to HIV infection.

Among 5-HT receptors, 5-HT2A receptor subtype seems to be an important target implicated in the above disorder. Methods: The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of antidepressants, such as imipramine (15 mg/kg), escitalopram (10 mg/kg) and tianeptine (10 mg/kg) as well as drugs with antidepressant activity, including N-acetylcysteine (100 mg/kg) and URB597 (a fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor, 0.3 mg/kg) on the 5-HT2A receptor labeling pattern in selected rat brain regions. Following acute or chronic (14 days) drug administration, rat brains were analyzed by using autoradiography with the 5HT(2A) receptor antagonist [H-3]ketanserin. Results: Single dose or chronic administration of imipramine decreased the radioligand binding in the claustrum and cortical subregions. The [H-3]ketanserin binding either increased or decreased in cortical areas after acute N-acetylcysteine and URB597 administration, respectively. A similar shift towards reduction of the [H-3]ketanserin binding was detected in the nucleus accumbens shell following either acute treatment with imipramine, escitalopram, N-acetylcysteine and URB597 or repeated administration of imipramine, tianeptine and URB597. Conclusions: In conclusion, the present result indicate different sensitivity of brain 5-HT2A receptors to antidepressant drugs depending on schedule of drug administration and rat brain regions. The decrease of accumbal shell 5-HT2A receptor labeling by antidepressant drugs exhibiting different primary mechanism of action seems to be a common targeting mechanism associated with the outcome of depression treatment.

Methods We synthesized 14 new PSMA-targeted, Lu-177-labeled radioligands (Lu-177-L1-Lu-177-L14) using different chelating agents and linkers. We evaluated them in vitro using human prostate cancer PSMA(+) PC3 PIP and PSMA(-) PC3 flu cells and in corresponding flank tumor models. Efficacy and toxicity after 8 weeks were evaluated at a single administration of 111 MBq for Lu-177-L1, Lu-177-L3, Lu-177-L5 and Lu-177-PSMA-617. Efficacy of Lu-177-L1 was further investigated using different doses, and long-term toxicity was determined in healthy immunocompetent mice. Results Radioligands were produced in high radiochemical yield and purity. Cell uptake and internalization indicated specific uptake only in PSMA(+) PC3 cells. Lu-177-L1, Lu-177-L3 and Lu-177-L5 demonstrated comparable uptake to Lu-177-PSMA-617 and Lu-177-PSMA-I&T in PSMA-expressing tumors up to 72 h post-injection. Lu-177-L1, Lu-177-L3 and Lu-177-L5 also demonstrated efficient tumor regression at 8 weeks. Lu-177-L1 enabled the highest survival rate. Necropsy studies of the treated group at 8 weeks revealed subacute damage to lacrimal glands and testes. No radiation nephropathy was observed 1 year post-treatment in healthy mice receiving 111 MBq of Lu-177-L1, most likely related to the fast renal clearance of this agent. Conclusions Lu-177-L1 is a viable clinical candidate for radionuclide therapy of PSMA-expressing malignancies because of its high tumor-targeting ability and low off-target radiotoxic effects.

These chimeric molecules consist of YGGF sequence, a crucial motif in the N-terminus of natural opioid peptides, and Ac-RYYRIK-NH2, which was isolated from a combinatorial peptide library as an antagonist or partial agonist that inhibits the biological activity of the endogenously occurring heptadecapeptide nociceptin. Solution structures for the peptides were studied by analysing their circular dichroism spectra. Receptor binding affinities were measured by equilibrium competition experiments using four highly selective radioligands. G-protein activating properties of the multitarget peptides were estimated in [S-35] GTP gamma S binding tests. The three compounds were also measured in electrically stimulated mouse vas deferens (MVD) bioassay. H-YGGFGGGRYYRIK-NH2 (BA55), carrying N-terminal opioid and C-terminal nociceptin-like sequences interconnected with GGG tripeptide spacer displayed a tendency of having either unordered or beta-sheet structures, was moderately potent in MVD and possessed a NOP/KOP receptor preference. A similar peptide without spacer H-YGGFRYYRIK-NH2 (BA62) exhibited the weakest effect in MVD, more a-helical periodicity was present in its structure and it exhibited the most efficacious agonist actions in the G-protein stimulation assays. The third hybrid peptide Ac-RYYRIKGGGYGGFL-OH (BA61) unexpectedly displayed opioid receptor affinities, because the opioid message motif is hidden within the C-terminus. The designed chimeric peptide ligands presented in this study accommodate well into a group of multitarget opioid compounds that include opioid-non-opioid peptide dimer analogues, dual non-peptide dimers and mixed peptide- non-peptide bifunctional ligands.

Herein we sought to investigate whether a single administration of metyrapone (150 mg/kg, i.p.), an 11 beta-hydroxylase inhibitor, enzyme involved in the peripheral and central synthesis of corticosteroids, had neuroprotective properties in this model. Two experiments were carried out. In exp. I, metyrapone was administered 3 h before pilocarpine injection whereas in exp. 2, metyrapone administration took place at the onset of the SE. In both experiments, 3 days after the insult, brain metabolism was assessed by in vivo 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). Brains were processed for analyses of markers of hippocampal integrity (Nissl staining), neurodegeneration (Fluoro-Jade C), astrogliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) immunohistochemistry) and, for a marker of activated microglia by in vitro autoradiography with the TSPO (18 kDa translocator protein) radioligand [F-18]GE180. The SE resulted in a consistent hypometabolism in hippocampus, cortex and striatum and neuronal damage, hippocampal neurodegeneration, neuronal death and gliosis. Interestingly, metyrapone had neuroprotective effects when administered before, but not after the insult. In summary, we conclude that metyrapone administration prior but not after the SE protected from brain damage induced by SE in the lithium-pilocarpine model. Therefore, it seems that the effect of metyrapone is preventive in nature and likely related to its antiseizure properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Due to the inherent imprecision of single voxel measurements, spatial smoothing is performed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of single-voxel estimates. In addition, smoothing compensates for imprecisions in anatomical registration, and allows for the use of cluster-based statistical thresholding. Smoothing has traditionally been applied in three dimensions, without taking the tissue types of surrounding voxels into account. This procedure may be suitable for subcortical structures, but is problematic for cortical regions for which grey matter often constitutes only a small proportion of the smoothed signal. New methods have been developed for cortical analysis in which voxels are sampled to a surface, and smoothing is restricted to neighbouring regions along the cortical grey matter in two dimensions. This procedure has recently been shown to decrease intersubject variability and bias of PET data. The aim of this study was to compare the variability, bias and test-retest reliability of volumetric and surface-based methods as they are applied in practice. Fifteen healthy young males were each measured twice using the dopamine D1 receptor radioligand [C-11] SCH-23390, and analyses were performed at the level of individual voxels and vertices within the cortex. We found that surface-based methods yielded higher BPND values, lower coefficient of variation, less bias, better reliability and more precise estimates of parametric binding. All in all, these results suggest that surface-based methods exhibit superior performance to volumetric approaches for voxelwise analysis of PET data, and we advocate for their use when a ROI-based analysis is not appropriate.

Alternative Radioligands for Investigating the Molecular Pharmacology of Melatonin Receptors	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							BINDING-SITES; MT1; BRAIN; AGOMELATINE; CLONING; ANTIDEPRESSANT; DERIVATIVES; LIGANDS; RETINA; LIGHT	Melatonin exerts a variety of physiologic activities that are mainly relayed through the melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2 Low expressions of these receptors in tissues have led to widespread experimental use of the agonist 2-[I-125]-iodomelatonin as a substitute for melatonin. We describe three iodinated ligands: 2-(2-[(2-iodo-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)methyl]-4,5-dimethoxy phenyl) (DIV880) and (2-iodo-N-2-[5-methoxy-2-(naphthalen-1-yl)1H-pyrrolo[3,2-b]pyridine-3-yl])acetamide (S70254), which are specific ligands at MT2 receptors, and N-[2-(5-methoxy-1H-indol-3-yl) ethyl]iodoacetamide (SD6), an analog of 2-[I-125]iodomelatonin with slightly different characteristics. Here, we further characterized these new ligands with regards to their molecular pharmacology. We performed binding experiments, saturation assays, association/dissociation rate measurements, and autoradiography using sheep and rat tissues and recombinant cell lines. Our results showed that [I-125]-S70254 is receptor, and can be used with both cells and tissue. This radioligand can be used in autoradiography. Similarly, DIV880, a partial agonist [43% of melatonin on guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate binding assay], selective for MT2, can be used as a tool to selectively describe the pharmacology of this receptor in tissue samples. The molecular pharmacology of both human melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, using a series of 24 ligands at these receptors and the new radioligands, did not lead to noticeable variations in the profiles. For the first time, we described radiolabeled tools that are specific for one of the melatonin receptors (MT2). These tools are amenable to binding experiments and to autoradiography using sheep or rat tissues. These specific tools will permit better understanding of the role and implication in physiopathologic processes of the melatonin receptors.

Resolvin D2 Supports MCF-7 Cell Proliferation via Activation of Estrogen Receptor	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							LIGAND-INDEPENDENT ACTIVATION; BREAST-CANCER; INFLAMMATION; RESOLUTION; EXPRESSION; D1; PHOSPHORYLATION; MEDIATORS; PATHWAYS; SURVIVAL	Inflammation has been implicated in tumor initiation, angiogenesis, and metastasis, and linked to the development of more aggressive, therapy-resistant estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Resolvin D2 (RvD2) is a potent anti-inflammatory lipid mediator. As RvD2 may be synthesized within breast tumors by both tumor cells and the surrounding stroma cells and is present in plasma at bioactive concentrations, we sought to characterize the impact of RvD2 on cell processes underlying breast tumor growth and spread. Trypan-blue exclusion, transfection with estrogen response element (ERE) reporter, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, competitive radioligand binding assays, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence were the techniques used. Unexpectedly, whereas RvD2 (10-1000 nM) supported the proliferation of the ER-positive breast tumor (MCF-7) cells, it did not affect the ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cell number. The proliferative effect of RvD2 in MCF-7 cells was attenuated by the ER antagonist ICI 182,780 (7 alpha-[9-[(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoropentyl)sulfinyl]nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17 beta-diol). Furthermore, RvD2 increased ERE transcriptional activity in a number of ER-positive breast and ovarian tumor cell lines. This activation was also inhibited by ICI 182,780. RvD2 altered the expression of a subset of estrogen-responsive genes. Although binding experiments showed that RvD2 did not directly compete with [H-3]17 beta-estradiol for ER binding, prior exposure of MCF-7 cells to RvD2 resulted in a significant reduction in the apparent cytosolic ER density. Confocal immunocytochemistry and Western blotting studies showed that RvD2 promoted nuclear localization of ER alpha. These observations indicate that RvD2 displays significant but indirect estrogenic properties and has the potential to play a role in estrogen-dependent breast cancer progression.

Parametric Imaging and Test-Retest Variability of <SUP>11</SUP>C-(+)-PHNO Binding to D<sub>2</sub>/D<sub>3</sub> Dopamine Receptors in Humans on the High-Resolution Research Tomograph PET Scanner	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						dopamine D2 receptor; dopamine D3 receptor; agonist; positron emission tomography; test-retest study	REFERENCE TISSUE MODEL; D-3 RECEPTOR; RADIOTRACER; AFFINITY; BRAIN; D3	C-11-(+)-4-propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine (C-11-(+)-PHNO) is an agonist radioligand for imaging dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors in the human brain with PET. In this study we evaluated the reproducibility of C-11-(+)-PHNO binding parameters using a within-day design and assessed parametric imaging methods. Methods: Repeated studies were performed in 8 subjects, with simultaneous measurement of the arterial input function and plasma free fraction. Two C-11-(+)-PHNO scans for the same subject were separated by 5.4 +/- 0.7 h. After compartment models were evaluated, C-11-(+)-PHNO volumes of distribution (V-T) and binding potentials relative to the concentration of tracer in plasma (BPP), nondisplaceable tracer in tissue (BPND), and free tracer in tissue (BPF) were quantified using the multilinear analysis MA1 method, with the cerebellum as the reference region. Parametric images of BPND were also computed using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and SRTM2. Results: The test-retest variability of C-11-(+)-PHNO BPND was 9% in D-2-rich regions (caudate and putamen). Among D-3-rich regions, variability was low in the pallidum (6%) but higher in substantia nigra (19%), thalamus (14%), and hypothalamus (21%). No significant mass carry-over effect was observed in D-3-rich regions, although a trend in BPND was present in the substantia nigra (-14% +/- 15%). Because of the relatively fast kinetics, low-noise BPND parametric images were obtained with both SRTM and SRTM2 without spatial smoothing. Conclusion: C-11-(+)-PHNO can be used to compute low-noise parametric images in both D-2- and D-3-rich regions in humans.

Differential regulation of muscarinic M<sub>2</sub> and M<sub>3</sub> receptor signaling in gastrointestinal smooth muscle by caveolin-1	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-CELL PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						caveolin-1; gastric emptying; internalization; muscarinic receptors; smooth muscle	ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; LIPID RAFTS; INTESTINAL MUSCLE; CARDIAC MYOCYTES; ADENYLYL-CYCLASE; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; URINARY-BLADDER; CELL BIOLOGY; CONTRACTION; PHOSPHORYLATION	Caveolae act as scaffolding proteins for several G protein-coupled receptor signaling molecules to regulate their activity. Caveolin-1, the predominant isoform in smooth muscle, drives the formation of caveolae. The precise role of caveolin-1 and caveolae as scaffolds for G protein-coupled receptor signaling and contraction in gastrointestinal muscle is unclear. Thus the aim of this study was to examine the role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of G(q)- and G(i)-coupled receptor signaling. RT-PCR, Western blot, and radioligand-binding studies demonstrated the selective expression of M-2 and M-3 receptors in gastric smooth muscle cells. Carbachol (CCh) stimulated phosphatidylinositol (PI) hydrolysis, Rho kinase and zipper-interacting protein (ZIP) kinase activity, induced myosin phosphatase 1 (MYPT1) phosphorylation (at Thr(696)) and 20-kDa myosin light chain (MLC20) phosphorylation (at Ser(19)) and muscle contraction, and inhibited cAMP formation. Stimulation of PI hydrolysis, Rho kinase, and ZIP kinase activity, phosphorylation of MYPT1 and MLC20, and muscle contraction in response to CCh were attenuated by methyl beta-cyclodextrin (M beta CD) or caveolin-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Similar inhibition of PI hydrolysis, Rho kinase, and ZIP kinase activity and muscle contraction in response to CCh and gastric emptying in vivo was obtained in caveolin-1-knockout mice compared with wild-type mice. Agonist-induced internalization of M-2, but not M-3, receptors was blocked by M beta CD or caveolin-1 siRNA. Stimulation of PI hydrolysis, Rho kinase, and ZIP kinase activities in response to other G(q)-coupled receptor agonists such as histamine and substance P was also attenuated by M beta CD or caveolin-1 siRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that caveolin-1 facilitates signaling by G(q)-coupled receptors and contributes to enhanced smooth muscle function.

We previously reported that in addition to its antipsychotic action, lurasidone shows beneficial effects on mood and cognition in rats, likely through 5-HT7 receptor antagonistic actions. In this study, we evaluated binding of lurasidone to 5-HT7 receptors in the rat brain by autoradiography using [H-3]SB-269970, a specific radioligand for 5-HT7 receptors. Brain slices were incubated with 4 nM [H-3]SB-269970 at room temperature and exposed to imaging plates for 8 weeks before phosphorimager analysis. Using this method, we first investigated 5-HT7 receptor distribution. We found that 5-HT7 receptors are abundantly localized in brain limbic structures, including the lateral septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala. On the other hand, its distribution was moderate in the cortex and low in the caudate putamen and cerebellum. Secondly, binding of lurasidone, a selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonist SB-656104-A and an atypical antipsychotic olanzapine to this receptor was examined. Lurasidone, SB-656104-A (10-1000 nM), and olanzapine (100-10,000 nM) showed concentration-dependent inhibition of [H-3]SB-269970 binding with IC50 values of 90, 49, and 5200 nM, respectively. Similar inhibitory actions of these drugs were shown in in vitro [H-3]SB-269970 binding to 5-HT7 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Since there was no marked species difference in rat and human 5-HT7 receptor binding by lurasidone (K-i = 1.55 and 2.10 nM, respectively), these findings suggest that binding to 5-HT7 receptors might play some role in its beneficial pharmacological actions in schizophrenic patients.

Methods: Six healthy subjects (three males and three females) were enrolled in this study. An average of 160.8 MBq of [F-18] FACT was intravenously administered, and then a series of whole-body PET scans were performed. Nineteen male and 20 female source organs, and the remainder of the body, were studied to estimate time-integrated activity coefficients. The mean absorbed dose in each target organ and the effective dose were estimated from the time-integrated activity coefficients in the source organs. Biodistribution data from [F-18] FACT in mice were also used to estimate absorbed doses and the effective dose in human subjects; this was compared with doses of [F-18] FACT estimated from human PET data. Results: The highest mean absorbed doses estimated using human PET data were observed in the gallbladder (333 +/- 251 mu Gy/MBq), liver (77.5 +/- 14.5 mu Gy/MBq), small intestine (33.6 +/- 30.7 mu Gy/MBq), upper large intestine (29.8 +/- 15.0 mu Gy/MBq) and lower large intestine (25.2 +/- 12.6 mu Gy/MBq). The average effective dose estimated from human PET data was 18.6 +/- 3.74 mu Sv/MBq. The highest mean absorbed dose value estimated from the mouse data was observed in the small intestine (38.5 mu Gy/MBq), liver (25.5 mu Gy/MBq) and urinary bladder wall (43.1 mu Gy/MBq). The effective dose estimated from the mouse data was 14.8 mu Sv/MBq for [F-18] FACT. Conclusions: The estimated effective dose from the human PET data indicated that the [F-18] FACT PET study was acceptable for clinical purposes.

Ligand-Specific Roles for Transmembrane 5 Serine Residues in the Binding and Efficacy of Dopamine D<sub>1</sub> Receptor Catechol Agonists	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTOR; AMINO-ACIDS; ACTIVATION; POTENT; D1; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTIVITY	To refine further the structure-activity relationships of D-1 dopamine receptor agonists, we investigated the roles of three conserved serine residues [Ser198(5.42), Ser199(5.43), and Ser202(5.46)] in agonist binding and receptor activation. These transmembrane domain 5 (TM5) residues are believed to engage catechol ligands through polar interactions. We stably expressed wild-type or mutant (S198A, S199A, and S202A) D-1 receptors in human embryonic kidney cells. These receptors were expressed at similar levels (approximately 2000 fmol/mg) and bound the radioligand [H-3]R(+)-7-chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (SCH 23390), although S198A and S199A displayed significant losses of affinity compared with that for wild-type receptors. The endogenous agonist, dopamine, had losses of potency at each of the mutant receptors. We tested cyclohexyl-substituted isochroman, carbocyclic, and chroman bicyclic dopamine analogs and found that the mutations affected the chroman to a lesser extent than the other compounds. These results support our hypothesis that the decreased D-1 activity of chroman analogs results from a ligand intramolecular hydrogen bond that impairs the ability of the catechol to engage the receptor. Sensitivities of these rigid catechol agonists to the effects of the serine mutations were dependent on ligand geometry, particularly with respect to the rotameric conformation of the ethylamine side chain and the distance between the amino group and each catechol hydroxyl. Functional experiments in striatal tissue suggest that the ability to engage TM5 serines is largely correlated with agonist efficacy for cAMP stimulation. These results provide a new understanding of the complexities of D-1 ligand recognition and agonist activation and have implications for the design of rigid catechol ligands.

[C-11](+)-PHNO is the first preferential D-3 receptor radioligand in humans, yet there are no blockade studies with a D-3 receptor antagonist in humans. This study characterized the blockade of [C-11](+))-PHNO binding by ABT-925, a D-3 receptor antagonist, in healthy male subjects. Sixteen subjects underwent 2-3 positron emission tomography (PET) scans, at baseline and following one or two doses of ABT-925 ranging from 50 mg to 600 mg. Receptor occupancies were estimated for globus pallidus, substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, and ventral striatum. At the 600-mg dose (n=9), ABT-925 receptor occupancy (mean +/- S.D.) was higher in substantia nigra (75 +/- 10%) and globus pallidus (64 +/- 22%) than in ventral striatum (44 +/- 17%), caudate (40 +/- 18%) and putamen (38 +/- 17%) (ANOVA: F-4,F-140 = 15.02, p<0.001). The fractions of [C-11](+)-PHNO binding attributable to D-3 receptors in D-3 receptor-rich regions were 100% (substantia nigra) and 90% (globus pallidus), and in D-2 receptor-rich regions were 55% (caudate) and 53% (putamen). The ED50 of ABT-925 was 4.37 mu g/ml across regions. Our results demonstrate that [C-11](+)-PHNO binding can be blocked by a D-3 receptor antagonist and confirm preclinical findings that [C-11](+)-PHNO signal in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus is mainly reflective of its binding to D-3 receptors. Thus, [C-11](+)-PHNO seems a suitable PET radiotracer to estimate D-3 receptor occupancy in humans.

Utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) and the radioligand N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl)ethyl)-N-(2-pyridinyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide ([Carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635), 5-HT1A binding was compared between depressed bipolar disorder (BD) and controls. Methods: Brain 5-HT1A binding potential (BPF = B-max/K-D, where B-max = total available receptors, and 1/K-D = ligand affinity) was measured in 32 currently depressed, medication-free BD subjects and 47 controls. Participants were genotyped for the 5-HT1A promoter polymorphism C(-1019)G. Results: The bipolar depressed group demonstrated higher 5-HT1A BPF across all regions of interest (ROIs; p = .022). Post hoc analyses indicated that male BD patients had higher 5-HT1A BPF than male controls (p = .025), with higher 5-HT1A BPF found in every region (by 102% in raphe nuclei and 29% to 50% in the forebrain ROIs); whereas, female subgroups did not differ in 5-HT1A BPF (p = 32). Serotonin-1A BPF did not correlate with depression severity. The GG genotype was overrepresented at trend level in the BD group (p = .057). Number of G-allele copies was associated with higher 5-HT1A BPF in raphe (p = .0050), amygdala (p = .022), and hippocampus (p = .041). Conclusions: Higher 5-HT1A BPF in bipolar depressed males suggests higher raphe autoreceptor binding, potentially causing less serotonin release and compensatory upregulation of forebrain postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptors. The raphe effect may be partly genetic. No difference in 5-HT1A BPF, between BD and control females may reflect greater effect of prior antidepressant exposure in BD females.

Effects of chronic opioid exposure on guinea pig mu opioid receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells: Comparison with human and rat receptor	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	36th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Neuroscience	OCT, 2006	Atlanta, GA	Soc Neurosci		G protein coupled receptor; down-regulation; desensitization; GTP gamma S binding; morphine; methadone	SH-SY5Y CELLS; CHO-CELLS; PHARMACOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION; MORPHINE; DESENSITIZATION; INTERNALIZATION; BRAIN; TOLERANCE; BINDING; EFFICACY	Chronic opioid treatment leads to agonist-specific effects at the mu opioid receptor. The molecular mechanisms resulting from chronic opioid exposure include desensitization, internalization and down-regulation of membrane-bound mu opioid receptors (MOP). The purpose of this study was to compare the cellular regulation of guinea pig, human and rat MOP expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, following exposure to two clinically important opioids, morphine and methadone. MOP expressing CHO cells were treated in culture with methadone or morphine for up to 48 h. Radioligand diprenorphine and [D-AIa(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO)-stimulated GTP gamma S binding assays were carried out using paired control and opioid-exposed CHO cells. Methadone induced down-regulation of the mu opioid receptor, while morphine induced desensitization of the receptor for all three species. Furthermore, morphine predominantly decreased the potency of DAMGO to stimulate GTP gamma S binding, whereas methadone primarily reduced its efficacy. Changes in DAMGO potency and efficacy differed among species and depended on the opioid used to treat the cells. Our results showed similarities between guinea pig and human MOP for morphine-induced desensitization, but identified differences between the two for methadone-induced desensitization. In contrast, human and rat MOP differed in response to morphine treatment, but were not distinct in their response to methadone treatment. The guinea pig is an excellent and established animal model to study opioid effects, but its molecular opioid pharmacology has not been investigated thus far. These results can assist in understanding species differences in the effects of opioid ligands activating the mu opioid receptor. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Despite extensive characterization, neither the improgan receptor, nor a pharmacological antagonist of improgan has been previously described. Presently, the specific binding of [3 H]cimetidine (3HCIM) in brain fractions was used to discover 4(5)-((4-iodobenzyl)thiomethyl)-1H-imidazole, which behaved in vivo as the first improgan antagonist. The synthesis and pharmacological properties of this drug (named CC12) are described herein. In rats, CC12 (50-500 nmol, i.c.v.) produced dose-dependent inhibition of improgan (200-400 nmol) antinociception on the tail flick and hot plate tests. When given alone to rats, CC12 had no effects on nociceptive latencies, or on other observable behavioral or motor functions. Maximal inhibitory effects of CC12 (500 nmol) were fully surmounted with a large i.c.v. dose of improgan (800 nmol), demonstrating competitive antagonism. In mice, CC12 (200-400 nmol, i.c.v.) behaved as a partial agonist, producing incomplete improgan antagonism, but also limited antinociception when given alone. Radioligand binding, receptor autoradiography, and electrophysiology experiments showed that CC12's antagonist properties are not explained by activity at 25 sites relevant to analgesia, including known receptors for cannabinoids, opioids or histamine. The use of CC12 as an improgan antagonist will facilitate the characterization of improgan analgesia. Furthermore, because CC12 was also found presently to inhibit opioid and cannabinoid antinociception, it is suggested that this drug modifies a biochemical mechanism shared by several classes of analgesics. Elucidation of this mechanism will enhance understanding of the biochemistry of pain relief. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Thienorphine: Receptor binding and behavioral effects in rhesus monkeys	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTOR; DISCRIMINATIVE-STIMULUS; HEROIN-ADDICTS; CLINICAL-TRIAL; BUPRENORPHINE; MORPHINE; NALTREXONE; AGONIST; ANTAGONIST; WITHDRAWAL	Thienorphine is an oripavine with long-lasting antinociceptive effects in mice that are thought to be mediated by mu-opioid receptors. This study examined the receptor binding of thienorphine in cell membrane homogenates and its behavioral effects in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Affinity and potency were determined using radioligand displacement and stimulation of guanosine 5'-O-( 3-[S-35] thio) triphosphate binding in C6 (mu, delta) and Chinese hamster ovary (kappa) cell membranes. Thienorphine displayed high affinity for kappa-, mu-, and delta-opioid receptors with K-i values of 0.14, 0.22, and 0.69 nM, respectively. Thienorphine partially stimulated kappa-opioid (75%) and mu-opioid (19%) receptors and not mu- opioid receptors. Thienorphine dose-dependently increased tail-withdrawal latency for 50 degrees C water and not 55 degrees C water with effects lasting for more than 7 days. The mu- opioid receptor antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI) (3.2 mg/kg) and a large dose (1.0 mg/ kg) of naltrexone prevented thienorphine-induced antinociception. Thienorphine enhanced the antinociceptive effects of morphine and U50,488 [trans-3, 4-dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-cyclohexyl]-benzeneacetamide] with 50 degrees C water; with 55 degrees C water, thienorphine enhanced the effects of morphine and attenuated the effects of U50,488. In other monkeys, thienorphine decreased responding in both components of a multiple schedule of food presentation and stimulus shock termination for up to 8 days; naltrexone and nor-BNI partially prevented these rate-decreasing effects. In morphine-treated monkeys discriminating naltrexone, thienorphine, and U50,488 neither substituted for nor modified the naltrexone discriminative stimulus. Thienorphine and U50,488 produced the same directly observable signs. These results show that thienorphine has long-lasting effects that seem to be mediated by low-efficacy agonism at kappa-opioid receptors, both in vitro and in vivo.

A variety of models have been applied to such data in several published articles; however to date, these models have not been validated with test-retest data. We recruited 11 healthy subjects and conducted two identical scans on each subject on the same day. We considered four different models (one-and two-tissue compartment kinetic models, likelihood estimation in graphical analysis (LEGA; a bias-free alternative to the graphical method), and basis pursuit) along with fast noniterative approximations to the kinetic models. We considered four different outcome measures (total volume of distribution (VT), binding potential with (BP) and without (BP1), free-fraction adjustment, and specific-to-nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficient (BP2)). To assess the performance of each model, we compared results using six different metrics ( percent difference (PD) and within-subject mean sum of squares for reproducibility, interclass coefficient for reliability, variance across subjects, identifiability based on bootstrap resampling of residuals for each method, and time stability analysis to determine minimal required scanning time). We considered analysis of both at the voxel level and at the region of interest (ROI) level and compared results from these two approaches to assess agreement. We determined that 100 mins of scanning time is adequate and that for ROI- level analysis, LEGA gives best results. Average PD is 5.51 for VT, 20.7 for BP, 17.2 for BP1, and 16.5 for BP2 across all regions. For voxel-level analysis we determined that the one-tissue compartment noniterative model is best.

The aim of this study was to determine the influence of late pregnancy in the uterus-relaxing effect of terbutaline in the rat in vitro. Rat uterine tissues from late pregnancy (days 15, 18, 20 and 22) were used. In vitro electrical field-stimulation (EFS) was used to evoke contractions. The radioligand-binding technique, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and radioimmunoassay technique were used to determine the beta-adrenergic receptor density and mRNA level and the plasma sex hormone level, respectively. The activated G-protein level of the P-adrenergic receptors was investigated by a radiolabelled GTP binding assay. EFS-induced contractions were inhibited by terbutaline. This effect decreased towards term with respect to both the EC50 and maximal inhibition values. A drop in plasma progesterone level was also detected. Binding studies revealed an increase in beta-adrenergic receptor number on the last day of pregnancy, which correlated with the change in receptor mRNA level. The G-protein-activating effect of terbutaline decreased continuously between days 15 and 20. Surprisingly, terbutaline decreased the G-protein activation to below the basal level on day 22. However, progesterone pretreatment set back the uterine action of terbutaline, increased the density of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptors and their mRNA level and increased the G-protein-activating property of terbutaline. These data provide evidence of a pregnancy-induced decrease in activated G-protein level after beta 2-agonist stimulation. The decrease in plasma progesterone level has a crucial role in this process. The effects Of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists in tocolytic therapy may possibly be potentiated with progesterone.

In the present study, we show for the first time that the adenine receptor is expressed in membrane preparations of native tissues and cell lines in high density, including rat brain cortex, rat brain striatum, and the mouse neuroblastoma X rat glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15. Saturation analysis with [H-3] adenine at rat brain cortical membranes exhibited a single high-affinity binding site with a K-D value of 27.2 nM, and a binding capacity of 2.28 pmol/mg of protein. Kinetic studies revealed unusual binding kinetics of [H-3] adenine with rapid association and slow dissociation. A series of compounds were investigated in [H-3] adenine competition experiments at rat brain cortex. Only minor substitution of the adenine structure was tolerated, the most potent compounds of the present series being 2-fluoroadenine (K-i value of 620 nM), 8-thioadenine (K-i value of 2.77 muM), N-6-methyladenine (K-i value of 3.64 muM), and 7-methyladenine (K-i value of 4.13 muM), all of which were partial agonists (40-60% intrinsic activity). Adenine dose dependently inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylate cyclase in membrane preparations of NG108-15 cells as well as in intact cells, showing that the receptor is functional in NG108-15 cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction experiments followed by sequencing indicate that the NG108-15 cells express the murine ortholog of the adenine receptor. Moreover, preliminary radioligand binding studies with [H-3] adenine at membranes of human astrocytoma 1321N1 cells suggest that a human ortholog of the rat adenine receptor exists.

All compounds showed high affinity for the DAT. The IC50 values ranged from 0.5 to 26 nM. With the exception of 3e and 3f, which have no substituent on the 2beta-(1,2-isoxazole) ring, all compounds were selective for the DAT relative to the 5-HTT and NET. No compound showed death when dosed at 100 mg/kg; however, most compounds did show signs typical of dopamine activity. The ED50 values for 2beta-(1,2-isoxazoles) that caused locomotor stimulation ranged from 0.2 to 12.8 mg/kg. Most compounds showed slower on-set and longer duration of action relative to cocaine. Surprisingly, 3beta-(4-methylphenyl)-2beta-[3-(4'-chlorophenyl)isoxazol-5-yl]tropane (3p) and 3beta-(4-methylphenyl)-2beta-[3-(4'-methylphenyl)isoxazol-5-yl]tropane (3r) did not produce significant increases in locomotor activity. In the cocaine discrimination test, all analogues showed full or at least 50% generalization with the exception of 3p, which did not show generalization. Importantly, both the locomotor activity and the cocaine discrimination ED50 values were correlated with the DAT binding but not 5-HTT and NET binding. This provides further support for the dopamine hypothesis of cocaine abuse. High DAT affinity and selectivity, increased locomotor activity with slow onset and long duration of action, and generalization to cocaine shown by the 3beta-(substituted phenyl)-2beta-(3-substituted isoxazol-5-yl)tropanes are properties thought necessary for a pharmacotherapy for treating cocaine abuse.

Following a convenient labelling protocol, the radiopeptide, [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1, formed in nearly quantitative yields and with high specific activities. Both unlabelled and labelled peptide demonstrated high-affinity binding in membrane preparations of the human androgen-independent prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 cell line. The IC50 values determined for Demobesin 1 and [Tyro]BN were 0.70+/-0.08 nM and 1.5+/-0.20 nM, respectively, while the K-d defined for [Tc-99m/Tc-99g]Demobesin 1 was 0.67+/-0.10 nM. [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 was rather stable in murine plasma, whereas it degraded rapidly in kidney and liver homogenates. After injection in healthy Swiss albino mice, [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 accumulated very efficiently in the target organs (pancreas, intestinal tract) via a GRP-R-mediated process, as shown by in vivo receptor blocking experiments. An equally high and GRP-R-mediated uptake was exhibited by [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 after injection in PC-3 tumour-bearing athymic mice. The initial high radioligand uptake of 16.2+/-3.1%ID/g in the PC-3 xenografts at 1 h p.i. remained at a similar level (15.61+/-1.19%ID/g) at 4 h p.i. Even after 24 h p.i., when the radioactivity had cleared from all other tissues, a value of 5.24+/-0.67%ID/g was still observed in the tumour. The high and prolonged localization of [Tc-99m]Demobesin 1 at the tumour site and its rapid background clearance are very promising qualities for GRP-R-targeted tumour imaging in man.

According to their molecular, biological, and pharmacological characteristics, they ore subdivided into alpha(1)-, alpha(2)- and beta(1)-, beta(2)-, beta(3)-, beta(4)-adrenoceptors. In cardiac disease, there is often a selective downregulation of beta(1)-adrenoceptors associated with a relative increase in beta(2)- and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Functional imaging techniques like single-photon emission tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) provide the unique capability for non-invasive assessment of cardiac adrenoceptors. Radioligands with high specific binding to cardiac alpha- and beta-adrenoceptors suitable for radiolabelling are required for clinical studies. The non-selective beta-adrenoceptor antagonist [C-11]CGP-12177 was used to quantify beta-adrenoceptor density using PET in patients with heart disease. New non-selective ligands (e. g. [C-11]CGP-12388, [F-18]CGP-12388, [C-11]corozolol and [F-18]fluorocarazolol) are currently evaluated; PI-selective radioligands (e. g. [C-11]CGP-26505, [C-11]bisoprolol, [C-11]HX-CH 44) and beta(2)-Selective radioligands (e. g. [C-11]formoterol, [C-11]ICI-118551) were assessed in animals. None of them turned out as suitable for cardiac PET. Potential radioligands for imaging cardiac alpha(1)-adrenoceptors ore based on prozosin. Whereas [C-11]prozosin shows low specific binding to myocardium, its derivative [C-11]GB67 looks more promising. The putative alpha(2)-adrenoceptor radioligand [C-11]MK-912 shows high uptake in rodent myocardium but has not yet been evaluated in man. A number of radioligands were evaluated for assessing cardiac adrenoceptors using PET. New radioligands are needed to provide more insight into cardiac pathophysiology which may influence the therapeutic management of patients with cardiovascular disease.

[F-18]MPPF is a useful radioligand for quantitative imaging of 5-HT1A receptors in human subjects. Previous studies have shown that the binding of some radioligands is sensitive to changes in neurotransmitter concentration, whereas in other cases, binding is not affected. In the present study we investigated if [F-18]MPPF binding to the 5-HT1A receptor is sensitive to changes in 5-HT. Changes in 5-HT levels were achieved by influencing its synthesis through tryptophan depletion, including a tryptophan-free amino acid drink 4.5 h prior to the PET scan and tryptophan infusion (10 mg/ml, 50 mg/kg, 30 min, starting 60 min prior to the PET scan). Binding of [F-18]MPPF in the brain of six healthy, male volunteers was compared in these two conditions. Mean binding potentials in the medial temporal cortex, cortical regions, and raphe nucleus did not significantly differ between the two conditions. The results of the study show that, under the experimental conditions used, [F-18]MPPF binding was not affected. It is hypothesized that the increases in 5-HT levels needed to produce a measurable effect on [F-18]MPPF binding would be significantly greater than that possible with tryptophan manipulation. Therefore, in pathological conditions, where such large increases in 5-HT levels are not expected, [F-18]MPPF seems a useful ligand to measure 5-HT1A receptor distribution without the interference of endogenous 5-HT.

Methods: Whole-body scans were obtained up to 48 h after intravenous injection of 555 MBq Tc-99m-RP527 in each of 6 subjects. Blood samples were taken at various times up to 48 h after injection. Urine was collected up to 48 h after injection for calculation of renal clearance and whole-body clearance. Time-activity curves were generated for the thyroid, heart, breasts in women, testes in men, and liver by fitting the organ-specific geometric mean counts, obtained from regions of interest, on the respective images as a function of the time after injection. The MIRD formulation was applied to calculate the absorbed radiation dose for various organs. Results: The serial whole-body images showed rapid hepatobiliary excretion, resulting in low background and potentially high-contrast imaging of the thoracic region. Imaging of abdominal tumors may prove problematic, however, because of the extensive bowel activity. Tc-99m-RP527 was predominantly cleared by the kidneys and to a lesser extent by the gastrointestinal tract. The mean excretion in the urine (+/- SD) at 48 h after injection was 58.3 +/- 5.4 percentage of the injected activity corrected for decay to the time of injection. The highest absorbed doses were received by the excretory organs (i.e., the urinary bladder and gallbladder wall). The average effective dose of Tc-99m-RP527 was estimated to be 0.0095 mSv/MBq. Conclusion: The biodistribution of Tc-99m-RP527 revealed low lung, myocardial, and liver uptake, which allowed early imaging of the supradiaphragmatic region with a favorable dosimetry (including effective dose) for administered activities required for SPECT imaging.

Though generally safe, side effects frequently occur that cause patient discomfort and sometimes lead to premature termination of the study or require aminophylline administration. Recently, a new class of A(2A) Ado receptor agonists was synthesized. ATL193 and ATL146e are 2-propynylcyclohexyl-5'-N-ethylcarboxamido derivatives of Ado. The study goals were to evaluate the potency and selectivity of these new compounds on-recombinant canine Ado receptors and to evaluate their hemodynamic properties in dogs to assess their usefulness as vasodilators for myocardial perfusion imaging. Methods and Results-In assays of recombinant canine Ado receptors, ATL-193 and ATL-146e were highly selective for the A(2A) over the A(1) and A(3) receptors and were more potent than MRE-0470 and CGS-21680. In 16 anesthetized dogs, the agonists were administered by infusion (ATL-193; n=7 normal) or bolus injection (ATL-146e; n=9 critical left anterior descending coronary artery stenosis), and hemodynamic responses were compared with those of Ado. Both agonists produced dose-dependent coronary flow (CF) elevation without provoking the hypotension observed with Ado. After an ATL-146e bolus, the CF increase was sustained for several minutes, providing ample time for injection and myocardial uptake of Tc-99m-sestamibi, and CF returned to baseline within 20 minutes. The CF increase was completely blocked by the selective A(2A) antagonist ZM241385 (3 mug . kg(-1) . min(-1)). Conclusions-ATL-193 and ATL-146e are highly potent and selective Ado A(2A) receptor agonists with excellent potential for use as vasodilators for myocardial perfusion imaging. An important advantage of ATL-146e is the ability to administer it by bolus injection.

Previous analyses of bolus injection [F-18]altanserin data provided 5-HT2A specific binding measures that were highly correlated with the in vitro distribution of 5-HT2A receptors and reflected decreased binding after ketanserin (5-HT2A antagonist) administration. These observations were made in the presence of a nonspecific tissue component that was consistent with blood-brain barrier (BBB) passage of radiolabeled metabolites (radiometabolites). In this work, we evaluated the in vivo kinetics of [18F]altanserin and two major radiometabolites of [F-18]altanserin, focusing on the kinetics of free and nonspecifically-bound radioactivity. PET studies were performed in baboons after the bolus injection of [F-18]altanserin or one of its major radiometabolites, either [F-18]altanserinol or [F-18]4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine, at baseline and after pharmacologic receptor blockade (blocking data). The cerebellar and blocking data were analyzed using either single (parent radiotracer) or dual (parent radiotracer and radiometabolites) input function methods. After bolus injection of either [F-18]altanserin metabolite, radioactivity crossed the BBB and localized nonspecifically. The radiometabolites were found to contribute to nonspecific "background" radioactivity that was similar in receptor-poor and receptor-rich regions. After bolus injection in baboons, two of the major radiometabolites of [F-18]altanserin crossed the BBB and contributed to a fairly uniform background of nonspecific radioactivity. This uniformity suggests that conventional analyses are appropriate for human bolus injection [F-18]altanserin PET data, although these methods may overestimate [F-18]altanserin nonspecific binding.

J	Bradley, KN; Rowan, EG; Harvey, AL				Bradley, KN; Rowan, EG; Harvey, AL			Effects of brucine, a plant alkaloid, on M<sub>1</sub> muscarinic receptors and α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors in the rabbit vas deferens preparation	TOXICON			English	Article						brucine; muscarinic cholinoceptors; adrenoceptors; muscarinic toxins; allosterism; prazosin; transmitter release	POSITIVE COOPERATIVE INTERACTIONS; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; BINDING-SITES; INHIBITION; SUBTYPES; AGONISTS; ANALOGS	The plant alkaloid brucine is an analogue of strychnine and is known to be an allosteric modulator at cloned M-1 muscarinic receptors. The functional effects of brucine were examined on the M-1 muscarinic receptors in the rabbit isolated vas deferens preparation. Brucine (10-100 muM) enhanced the effects of the muscarinic agonist McN-A-343 at presynaptic M-1 muscarinic receptors in the rabbit isolated vas deferens preparation, but only when brucine was added prior to McN-A-343. This effect is indicative of a positive allosteric action. It was poorly reversed on washing. Brucine did not affect the responses to the mamba venom muscarinic toxins MT2 and MT4, which are also allosteric activators in this preparation. Brucine (10-100 muM) caused a significant decrease in the twitch response to electrical stimulation in the rabbit vas deferens preparation, which was not antagonised by 100 nM pirenzepine (an M-1 muscarinic antagonist). Brucine and MT4, but not MT2, caused significant decreases (p < 0.05) in the responses to noradrenaline in the rabbit vas deferens preparation. Responses to ATP and KCl were not affected. In radioligand binding assays, brucine displaced the <alpha>(1)-adrenoceptor ligand prazosin from its specific binding sites in membranes made from rat cerebral cortex and rat vas deferens. The apparent K-i values were 150 and 3.4 muM in the cortical and vas deferens membranes, respectively. The positive allosterism found with brucine at cloned M-1 receptors seems to be mirrored at native M-1 receptors. However, the unexpected blocking effects at alpha (1)-adrenoceptors indicates that more selective ligands than brucine are required as starting points for the design of specific enhancers of the activity of M-1 receptors with therapeutic potential.

Using a restraint stress paradigm, bath normotensive Wistar. Kyoto (WKY) and Spontaneously Hypertensive mts (SHR) underwent acute (1 h restraint in a perspex tube), chronic (1 h restraint for ten consecutive days) or no restraint (control) stress. Following cessation of restraint, rats were processed by incubating sections of brain stem and kidney with [I-125]-HO-LVA (0.03 nM) or [I-125]Sar(1)Ile(8)-AngiorensinII (0.5 nhl), in the presence of PD123319 (10 muM) or losartan (10 muM), to determine the distribution and density of vasopressin V-1A, angiotensin AT(1) and AT(2) receptors, respectively, Analysis of autoradiograms indicated changes in the density of radioligand binding in acutely and chronically-stressed rats, as compared to controls. For example, V-1A binding in the medial nucleus tractus solitarius (SolM) decreased in the WKY but increased in the SHR. AT(1) binding in SolM did not significantly change in the WKY but decreased in the SHR with repeated restraint. In kidney slices, AT(1) binding decreased with stress in the WKY (-17%) but increased in SHR (+10-15%). AT(2) binding in the kidney showed a pattern similar to that of AT(1) binding in SHR, but not WKY. Graded increases in V-1A binding were measured in kidney medulla and cortex of both strains (+50-60% with chronic restraint). These results suggest that physiological adaptation to restraint is associated with specific changes in V-1A, AT(1) and AT(2) receptor density within brain nuclei and kidney.

Neurokinin (NK)A is the endogenous ligand for the tachykinin NK2 receptor. In the present study, tachykinins and selective receptor agonists were tested as contractile agonists in human colon circular muscle and [I-125]-NKA was used to localize binding sites in human colon. 2. In strips of circular muscle, removal of mucosa and submucosa significantly (P < 0.05) increased the potency and the maximum response achieved by NKA. 3. The rank order of potency of tachykinin and selective receptor agonists in contracting circular muscle strips was NKA greater than or equal to [Lys(5),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) greater than or equal to neuropeptide (NP)gamma greater than or equal to [beta Ala(8)]NKA(4-10) >> NKB > substance P (SP) >> senktide approximate to [Pro(9)]SP. 4. Specific binding sites for [I-125]-NKA were densely localized over circular muscle and muscularis mucosae. Weak specific binding was seen on longitudinal muscle and taenia coli, whereas no binding sites were seen on mucosa, ganglia or blood vessels. 5. In circular muscle, the selective NK2 receptor agonist [Lys(5),MeLeu(9),Nle(10)]NKA(4-10) produced weak increases (maximum 37%) in inositol monophosphate formation with a pD(2) of 6.8 +/- 0.51 (n = 3). Carbachol (100 mu mol/L) was also a weak stimulant (maximum 45%). These agonists were over 10-fold more efficacious in stimulation of inositol monophosphate in rat urinary bladder. 6. In conclusion, [I-125]-NKA binding sites localized on human colon circular muscle were characterized as NK2 receptors. Functionally, the tachykinin NK2 receptor is mediating circular smooth muscle contraction. Although the human NK2 receptor is coupled to the phosphatidylinositol pathway, other second messenger mechanisms may also operate in this tissue.

However, the interaction between the two cardioprotective adenosine receptors and the question of which receptor is the more important anti-ischemic receptor remain largely unexplored. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that activation of both receptors exerted a cardioprotective effect that was significantly greater than activation of either receptor individually. This was accomplished by using a novel design in which new binary conjugates of adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptor agonists were synthesized and tested in a novel cardiac myocyte model of adenosine-elicited cardioprotection. Binary drugs having mixed selectivity for both A(1) and A(3) receptors were created through the covalent linking of functionalized congeners of adenosine agonists, each being selective for either the A(1) or A(3) receptor subtype. MRS 1740 and MRS 1741, thiourea-linked, regioisomers of a binary conjugate, were highly potent and selective in radioligand binding assays for A(1) and A(3) receptors (K-i values of 0.7-3.5 nM) versus A(2A) receptors. The myocyte models utilized cultured chick embryo cells, either ventricular cells expressing native adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptors, or engineered atrial cells, in which either human A(3) receptors alone or both human A(1) and A(3) receptors were expressed. The binary agonist MRS 1741 coactivated A(1) and A(3) receptors simultaneously, with full cardioprotection (EC50 similar to 0.1 nM) dependent on expression of both receptors, Thus, co-activation of both adenosine A(1) and A(3) receptors by the binary A(1)/A(3) agonists represents a novel general cardioprotective approach for the treatment of myocardial ischemia.

In this study we examined salivary gland tumors and discovered that the pleomorphic adenoma, a tumor which should be surgically removed because it has a tendency to become malign, has a strong concentration of the somatostatin receptor 2. This characteristic may allow physicians to identify and potentially treat the tumor in a non-invasive manner. Reliable preoperative diagnosis between salivary gland tumor entities is difficult. In this monocentric retrospective study, we examined the somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) status of salivary gland tumors after salivary gland tumor resection via immunohistochemistry (IHC), and stains were compared in analogy to the HER2 mamma scale. A total of 42.3% of all pleomorphic adenoma (PA) tumors (42 of 99, 95% confidence interval 32.5-52.8%) demonstrated & GE;20% of cells displaying the SSTR2 as compared to just 1% of all other tumors (1/160, 95% CI 0.02-3.4%). The other tumor was a neuroendocrine carcinoma. PA had a higher intensity of SSTR2 staining, with 90.9% staining & GE; an intensity of 2 (moderate). Tumors with an intensity of SSTR2 expression equal to or greater than 2 had an 89.9% likelihood of being a PA (95% CI: 82.2-95.0%, AUC: 0.928). Only one Warthin tumor demonstrated a 'strong' SSTR2 staining intensity. No Warthin tumor showed a percentage of cells staining for SSTR2 above & GE;20%. This result demonstrates consistent and strong expression of SSTR2 in PAs as compared to Warthin tumors, which may allow physicians to utilize radioligand-somatostatin analog PET CT/MR imaging to diagnose the PA. SSTR2 positivity, if shown to be clinically relevant, may allow peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in the future.

The advantages of using a pretargeted imaging approach are on the one hand the possibility to achieve a high signal-to-noise ratio and imaging contrast; on the other hand, the method allows the uncoupling of the biological half-life of antibodies from the physical half-life of short-lived radionuclides. A brain-penetrating antibody (mAb) specific for beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques was functionalized with TCO moieties for pretargeted labeling of A beta plaques in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo by a tritium-labeled Tz. The overall aim was to explore the applicability of mAbs for brain imaging, using a preclinical model system. In vitro clicked mAb-TCO-Tz was able to pass the blood-brain barrier of transgenic PS2APP mice and specifically visualize A beta plaques ex vivo. Further experiments showed that click reactivity of the mAb-TCO construct in vivo persisted up to 3 days after injection by labeling A beta plaques ex vivo after incubation of brain sections with the Tz in vitro. An attempted in vivo click reaction between injected mAb-TCO and Tz did not lead to significant labeling of A beta plaques, most probably due to unfavorable in vivo properties of the used Tz and a long half-life of the mAb-TCO in the blood stream. This study clearly demonstrates that pretargeted imaging of CNS targets via antibody-based click chemistry is a viable approach. Further experiments are warranted to optimize the balance between stability and reactivity of all reactants, particularly the Tz.

Low-Dose Augmentation With Buprenorphine for Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial With Multimodal Assessment of Target Engagement	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY: GLOBAL OPEN SCIENCE			English	Article							KAPPA-OPIOID RECEPTOR; MOTOR CORTEX; ANTAGONIST RADIOTRACER; MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL INHIBITION; BETA-ENDORPHIN; LATE-LIFE; C-11-LY2795050; PLASTICITY; BRAIN	BACKGROUND: The experimental therapeutics approach that combines a placebo-controlled clinical trial with translational neuroscience methods can provide a better understanding of both the clinical and physiological effects of pharmacotherapy. We aimed to test the efficacy and tolerability of low-dose augmentation with buprenorphine (BPN) for treatment-resistant depression, combined with multimodal assessment of target engagement. METHODS: In this multisite randomized clinical trial, 85 participants $50 years of age with a major depressive episode that had not responded to venlafaxine extended release were randomized to augmentation with BPN or placebo for 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-& ANGS;sberg Depression Rating Scale. In addition, three linked experiments were conducted to test target engagement: 1) functional magnetic resonance imaging using the monetary incentive delay task, 2) brain positron emission tomography of healthy participants using a novel kappa opioid receptor antagonist tracer [11C]LY2795050, and 3) transcranial magnetic stimulation measure of cortical transmission after daily BPN administration. RESULTS: The mean & PLUSMN; SD dosage of BPN was 0.59 & PLUSMN; 0.33 mg/day. There were no significant differences between the BPN and placebo groups in Montgomery-& ANGS;sberg Depression Rating Scale changes over time or adverse effects. BPN administration had minimal effects on functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygen level-dependent responses in regions involved in reward anticipation and response, no significant displacement of kappa opioid receptor radioligand in positron emission tomography imaging, and no significant changes in transcranial magnetic stimulation measures of inhibitory and excitatory cortical transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a lack of clinical effect of low-dose BPN augmentation and lack of target engagement with this dosage and physiological probes.

The aim of this work was to investigate (1) the presence of neuroinflammation in aviremic people with HIV (PWH) on therapy and in nontreated aviremic PWH (elite controllers [ECs]) using a translocator protein 18 kDa radioligand; (2) the relationship between neuroinflammation and cognitive function in aviremic PWH; and (3) the relationship between [C-11]-PBR28 signal and quantitative MRI (qMRI) measures of brain tissue integrity such as T1 and T2 relaxation times (rts). Methods [C-11]-PBR28 (standard uptake value ratio, SUVR) images were generated in 36 participants (14 PWH, 6 ECs, and 16 healthy controls) using a statistically defined pseudoreference region. Group comparisons of [C-11]-PBR28 SUVR were performed using region of interest-based and voxelwise analyses. The relationship between inflammation, qMRI measures, and cognitive function was studied. Results In region of interest analyses, ECs exhibited significantly lower [C-11]-PBR28 signal in the thalamus, putamen, superior temporal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and cerebellum compared with the PWH. In voxelwise analyses, differences were observed in the thalamus, precuneus cortex, inferior temporal gyrus, occipital cortex, cerebellum, and white matter (WM). [C-11]-PBR28 signal in the WM and superior temporal gyrus was related to processing speed and selective attention in PWH. In a subset of PWH (n = 12), [C-11]-PBR28 signal in the thalamus and WM regions was related to a decrease in T2 rt and to an increase in T1 rt suggesting a colocalization of increased glial metabolism, decrease in microstructural integrity, and iron accumulation. Discussion This study casts a new light onto the role of neuroinflammation and related microstructural alterations of HIV infection in the CNS and shows that ECs suppress neuroinflammation more effectively than PWH on therapy.

It is recognized that the brain plays a key role in the (patho)physiology of obesity and that there is a bidirectional relationship between obesity and psychopathology, yet molecular mechanisms altered in obesity have not been fully elucidated. Thus, we investigated relationships between obesity and synaptic density in vivo using the radioligand [C-11]UCB-J (which binds to synaptic glycoprotein SV2A) and positron emission tomography in individuals with obesity, and with or without stress-related psychiatric disorders. Regions of interest were the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, ventromedial, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum. Forty individuals with a body mass index (BMI) >= 25 kg/m(2) (overweight/obese), with (n = 28) or without (n = 12) psychiatric diagnosis, were compared to 30 age- and sex-matched normal weight individuals (BMI < 25), with (n = 14) or without (n = 16) psychiatric diagnosis. Overall, significantly lower synaptic density was observed in overweight/obese relative to normal weight participants (eta(2)(p) = 0.193, F = 2.35, p = 0.042). Importantly, in participants with stress-related psychiatric diagnoses, we found BMI to be negatively correlated with synaptic density in all regions of interest (p <= 0.03), but no such relationship observed for mentally healthy controls (p >= 0.68). In the stress-related psychiatric groups, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex synaptic density was negatively associated with measures of worry (r = -0.46, p = 0.01), tension/anxiety (r = -0.38, p = 0.04), fatigue (r = -0.44, p = 0.02), and attentional difficulties (r = -0.44, p = 0.02). In summary, the findings of this novel in vivo experiment suggest compounding effects of obesity and stress-related psychopathology on the brain and the associated symptomatology that may impact functioning. This offers a novel biological mechanism for the relationship between overweight/obesity and stress-related psychiatric disorders that may guide future intervention development efforts.

Ga-68-PSMA-11 has already received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, and use of PSMA PET is currently suggested by several international guidelines for investigating PCa in different clinical settings. In primary PCa, PSMA PET has been shown to be superior to cross-sectional imaging for the detection of peMc lymph nodes and distant metastases with subsequent clinical management changes. Additionally, it might also have a role in intraprostatic tumor localization, especially when combined with multiparametric MRI. In a setting of PCa recurrence, higher detection rates have been observed than for any other available imaging techniques, especially at low prostate-specific antigen values. Furthermore, PSMA PET consistently led to a shift in clinical management, thus increasing the proportion of radiotherapy, surgery, or other focal therapies at the expense of systemic options or no treatment. In oligometastatic disease after radical surgery, PSMA PET may be relevant in guiding a metastasis-directed therapy approach, as preliminary data seem to suggest a benefit in terms of progression-free survival after treatment of PSMA PET-positive lesions. As a staging and gatekeeping technique, PSMA PET represents a reliable wholebody imaging procedure in combination with second-line therapy of castration-resistant PCa, as well as being pivotal when assessing patients eligible for radioligand therapy such as Lu-177-PSMA. This critical review aims at providing a comprehensive overview of the latest literature on the current or emerging main indications, as well as a general outlook on the recommended interpretation criteria for PSMA PET imaging.

We have previously shown increased [C-11]-PBR28 uptake in the precentral gyrus in a small group of ALS patients. Herein, we confirm our initial finding, study the longitudinal changes, and characterize the gray versus white matter distribution of [C-11]-PBR28 uptake in a larger cohort of patients with ALS and PLS. MethodsEighty-five participants including 53 with ALS, 11 with PLS, and 21 healthy controls underwent integrated [C-11]-PBR28 PET-magnetic resonance brain imaging. Patients were clinically assessed using the Upper Motor Neuron Burden (UMNB) and the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). [C-11]-PBR28 uptake was quantified as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and compared between groups. Cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy were compared between groups and correlated with SUVR and the clinical data. [C-11]-PBR28 uptake and ALSFRS-R were compared longitudinally over 6 months in 10 ALS individuals. ResultsWhole brain voxelwise, surface-based, and region of interest analyses revealed increased [C-11]-PBR28 uptake in the precentral and paracentral gyri in ALS, and in the subcortical white matter for the same regions in PLS, compared to controls. The increase in [C-11]-PBR28 uptake colocalized and correlated with cortical thinning, reduced fractional anisotropy, and increased mean diffusivity, and correlated with higher UMNB score. No significant changes were detected in [C-11]-PBR28 uptake over 6 months despite clinical progression. InterpretationGlial activation measured by in vivo [C-11]-PBR28 PET is increased in pathologically relevant regions in people with ALS and correlates with clinical measures.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability and sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using [F-18]DPA-714, a translocator protein (TSPO) 18 kDa radioligand, to detect and quantify neuroinflammation in ZIKV-infected mice. We assessed ZIKV-induced pathogenesis in wild-type C57BL/6 mice administered an antibody to inhibit type I interferon (IFN) signaling. [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging was performed on days 3, 6, and 10 post-infection (PI), and tissues were subsequently processed for histological evaluation, quantification of microgliosis, and detection of viral RNA by in situ hybridization (ISH). In susceptible ZIKV-infected mice, viral titers in the brain increased from days 3 to 10 PI. Over this span, these mice showed a two- to sixfold increase in global brain neuroinflammation using [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging despite limited, regional detection of viral RNA. No measurable increase in ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1) expression was noted at day 3 PI; however, there was a modest increase at day 6 PI and an approximately significant fourfold increase in Iba-1 expression at day 10 PI in the susceptible ZIKV-infected group relative to controls. The results of the current study demonstrate that global neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the progression of ZIKV infection and that [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging is a sensitive tool relative to histology for the detection of neuroinflammation. [F-18]DPA-714 PET imaging may be useful in dynamically characterizing the pathology associated with neurotropic viruses and the evaluation of therapeutics being developed for treatment of infectious diseases.

The method is based on liquid chromatographic separation (LC) of metabolic mixtures followed by parallel mass spectrometry (MS) identification and bioaffinity determination. The bioaffinity is assessed using radioligand binding assays in 96-well plates after at-line nanofractionation. The described method was optimized for chemokines and low-molecular weight CXCR2 ligands. The limits of detection (LODs; injected amounts) for MK-7123, a high affinity binder to both CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors belonging to the diaminocyclobutendione chemical class, were 40 pmol in CXCR1 binding and 8 pmol in CXCR2 binding. For CXCL8, the LOD was 5 pmol in both binding assays. A control compound was always taken along with each bioassay plate as triplicate dose-response curve. For MK-7123, the calculated IC50 values were 314 +/- 59 nM (CXCR1 binding) and 38 +/- 11 nM (CXCR2 binding). For CXCL8, the IC50 values were 6.9 +/- 1.4 nM (CXCR1 binding) and 2.7 +/- 1.3 nM (CXCR2 binding). After optimization, the method was applied to the analysis of metabolic mixtures of eight LMW CXCR2 antagonists generated by incubation with pig liver microsomes. Moreover, metabolic profiling of the MK-7123 compound was described using the developed method. Three bioactive metabolites were found, two of which were (partially) identified. This method is suitable for bioaffinity and selectivity assessment of mixtures targeting the CXCR2. In contrary to conventional LC MS based metabolic profiling studies done at the early lead discovery stage, additional qualitative bioactivity information of drug metabolites is obtained with the method described.

We investigated whether individual differences in body mass index, percent body fat, pancreatic beta-cell function, and dopamine D2 receptor binding were related to reward discounting in obese and non-obese adult men and women. Obese (n = 27; body mass index>30) and non-obese (n = 20; body mass index<30) adults were assessed for percent body fat with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and for beta-cell function using disposition index. Choice of larger, but delayed or less certain, monetary rewards relative to immediate, certain smaller monetary rewards was measured using delayed and probabilistic reward discounting tasks. Positron emission tomography using a non-displaceable D2-specific radioligand, [C-11](N-methyl) benperidol quantified striatal D2 receptor binding. Groups differed in body mass index, percent body fat, and disposition index, but not in striatal D2 receptor specific binding or reward discounting. Higher percent body fat in non-obese women related to preference for a smaller, certain reward over a larger, less likely one (greater probabilistic discounting). Lower beta-cell function in the total sample and lower insulin sensitivity in obese related to stronger preference for an immediate and smaller monetary reward over delayed receipt of a larger one (greater delay discounting). In obese adults, higher striatal D2 receptor binding related to greater delay discounting. Interestingly, striatal D2 receptor binding was not significantly related to body mass index, percent body fat, or beta-cell function in either group. Our findings indicate that individual differences in percent body fat, beta-cell function, and striatal D2 receptor binding may each contribute to altered reward discounting behavior in non-obese and obese individuals. These results raise interesting questions about whether and how striatal D2 receptor binding and metabolic factors, including beta-cell function, interact to affect reward discounting in humans.

This Phase I study assessed safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple daily doses of BMS-820836 in healthy subjects. Central serotonin transporter (SERT) and dopamine transporter (DAT) occupancy were assessed using positron emission tomography and [C-11]MADAM or [C-11]PE2I, respectively. Fifty-seven healthy volunteers were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending multiple-dose study (ClincalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00892840). Eight participants in seven dose cohorts received oral doses of BMS-820836 (0.1-4 mg) or placebo for 14 days to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics. Additionally, SERT and DAT occupancies were evaluated in 4-8 subjects per cohort at 8 h post-dose on Day 10 and 24 h post-dose on Day 15 at anticipated steady-state conditions. Most adverse events were mild to moderate; there were no serious safety concerns. Median maximum concentrations of BMS-820836 were observed at 4.0-5.5 h post-dose; estimated elimination half-life was 44-74 h. About 80 % striatal SERT occupancy was achieved after multiple doses of 0.5 mg BMS-820836 at both 8 and 24 h post-dose. Striatal DAT occupancy ranged between 14 % and 35 % at 8 h post-dose with a slight decline at 24 h post-dose. Multiple daily doses of up to 4 mg BMS-820836 appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated in a healthy population. SERT and DAT occupancies were in a range associated with therapeutic efficacy of antidepressants. Together with the pharmacokinetic profile of BMS-820836, the occupancy data support once-daily administration.

Stevens			Effects of Monoamine Reuptake Inhibitors in Assays of Acute Pain-Stimulated and Pain-Depressed Behavior in Rats	JOURNAL OF PAIN			English	Article						Analgesia; antidepressant; dopamine; intracranial self-stimulation; monoamine reuptake inhibitor	INTRACRANIAL SELF-STIMULATION; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTERS; PERSISTENT PAIN; ANIMAL-MODELS; ANTIDEPRESSANTS; SEROTONIN; RADIOLIGAND; ANALGESICS; COCAINE; NOREPINEPHRINE	Pain is associated with stimulation of some behaviors (eg, withdrawal reflexes) but depression of many other behaviors (eg, feeding, locomotion, positively reinforced operant behavior). Drugs that block reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine are widely used to treat depression, and they have also emerged as useful drugs for treatment of pain. This study compared effects of selective and mixed-action inhibitors of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine reuptake in assays of acute pain-stimulated and pain-depressed behavior. Intraperitoneal injection of dilute acid served as a noxious stimulus to stimulate a writhing response or depress intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) in Sprague Dawley rats. Selective reuptake inhibitors of serotonin (citalopram, clomipramine) and norepinephrine (nisoxetine, nortriptyline) and a mixed-action reuptake inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine (milnacipran) blocked acid-stimulated writhing but failed to block acid-induced depression of ICSS. Selective dopamine reuptake inhibitors (RTI-113 [3 beta-(4-chlorophenyl)tropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid phenyl ester hydrochloride], bupropion) and a triple reuptake inhibitor of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine (RTI-112 [3 beta-(3-methyl-4-chlorophenyl) tropane-2 beta-carboxylic acid methyl ester hydrochloride]) blocked both acid-stimulated writhing and acid-induced depression of ICSS, although these drugs also produced an abuse-related facilitation of ICSS in the absence of the noxious stimulus. These results support further consideration of dopamine reuptake inhibitors as candidate analgesics, although abuse liability remains a concern. Perspective: Monoamine reuptake inhibitors are used to treat depression and some forms of pain. This study examined effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors in a predinical assay of pain-related behavioral depression. The results support further consideration of dopamine reuptake inhibitors as candidate analgesics under selected circumstances, although abuse liability remains a concern.

Both efficacy and safety are crucial in clinical settings and thorough investigations of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics can predict contributing factors such as duration of action and undesirable effects. To this end, we studied the interactions between various "dual" orexin receptor antagonists and the orexin receptors, OX1R and OX2R, over time using saturation and competition radioligand binding with [H-3]-BBAC ((S)-N-([1,1'-biphenyl]-2-yl)-1-(2-((1-methyl-1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)thio)acetyl)pyrrolidine-2-carboxamide). In addition, the kinetics of these compounds were investigated in cells expressing human, mouse and rat OX1R and OX2R using FLIPR (R) assays for calcium accumulation. We demonstrate that almorexant reaches equilibrium very slowly at OX2R, whereas SB-649868, suvorexant, and filorexant may take hours to reach steady state at both orexin receptors. By contrast, compounds such as BBAC or the selective OX2R antagonist IPSU ((2-((1H-Indol-3-yl)methyl)-9-(4-methoxypyrimidin-2-yl)-2,9-diazaspiro[5.5]undecan-1-one) bind rapidly and reach equilibrium very quickly in binding and/or functional assays. Overall, the "dual" antagonists tested here tend to be rather unselective under non-equilibrium conditions and reach equilibrium very slowly. Once equilibrium is reached, each ligand demonstrates a selectivity profile that is however, distinct from the non-equilibrium condition. The slow kinetics of the "dual" antagonists tested suggest that in vitro receptor occupancy may be longer lasting than would be predicted. This raises questions as to whether pharmacokinetic studies measuring plasma or brain levels of these antagonists are accurate reflections of receptor occupancy in vivo.

Six Commercially Available Angiotensin II AT<sub>1</sub> Receptor Antibodies are Non-specific	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR NEUROBIOLOGY			English	Article						GPCR receptor antibodies; Antibody characterization; Angiotensin II receptors; Renin-angiotensin System; AT(1) receptor immunocytochemistry; AT(1) receptor antibodies; AT(1A) receptor knock-out	BLOOD-PRESSURE REGULATION; HYPOTHALAMIC CELL-LINE; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; DEFICIENT MICE; RAT-BRAIN; EXPRESSION; SPECIFICITY; SUBTYPES; MOUSE; GENE	Commercially available Angiotensin II AT(1) receptor antibodies are widely employed for receptor localization and quantification, but they have not been adequately validated. In this study, six commercially available AT(1) receptor antibodies were characterized by established criteria: sc-1173 and sc-579 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., AAR-011 from Alomone Labs, Ltd., AB15552 from Millipore, and ab18801 and ab9391 from Abcam. The immunostaining patterns observed were different for every antibody tested, and were unrelated to the presence or absence of AT(1) receptors. The antibodies detected a 43 kDa band in western blots, corresponding to the predicted size of the native AT(1) receptor. However, identical bands were observed in wild-type mice and in AT(1A) knock-out mice not expressing the target protein. Moreover, immunoreactivity detected in rat hypothalamic 4B cells not expressing AT(1) receptors or transfected with AT(1A) receptor construct was identical, as revealed by western blotting and immunocytochemistry in cultured 4B cells. Additional prominent immunoreactive bands above and below 43 kDa were observed by western blotting in extracts from tissues of AT(1A) knock-out and wild-type mice and in 4B cells with or without AT(1) receptor expression. In all cases, the patterns of immunoreactivity were independent of the AT(1) receptor expression and different for each antibody studied. We conclude that, in our experimental setup, none of the commercially available AT(1) receptor antibodies tested met the criteria for specificity and that competitive radioligand binding remains the only reliable approach to study AT(1) receptor physiology in the absence of full antibody characterization.

However, there is still controversy regarding the pattern of striatal dopaminergic dysfunction in patients with MJD. In this study, we investigated whether these patients had different Dopamine Transporter (DAT) densities as compared to healthy subjects, and correlated these data with cognitive performance and sense of smell. Twenty-two MJD patients and 20 control subjects were enrolled. The neuropsychological assessment comprised the Spatial Span, Symbol Search, Picture Completion, Stroop Color Word Test, Trail Making Test and Phonemic Verbal Fluency test. The 16-item Sniffin' Sticks was used to evaluate odor identification. DAT imaging was performed using the SPECT radioligand [Tc-99m]-TRODAT-1, alongside with Magnetic Resonance imaging. Patients with MJD showed significantly lower DAT density in the caudate (1.34 +/- 0.27 versus 2.02 +/- 0.50, p < 0.001), posterior putamen (0.81 +/- 0.32 versus 1.32 +/- 0.34, p < 0.001) and anterior putamen (1.10 +/- 0.31 versus 1.85 +/- 0.45, p < 0.001) compared with healthy controls. The putamen/caudate ratio was also significantly lower in patients compared with controls (0.73 +/- 0.038 versus 0.85 +/- 0.032, p = 0.027). Even though we had only two patients with parkinsonisrn, we detected striatal dopaminergic deficits in those patients. No significant correlations were detected between DAT density and cognitive performance or Sniffin' Sticks scores. The data suggests that striatal dopamine deficit is not involved in cognitive or sense of smell deficits. This finding raises the possibility of extra-striatal dopamine and other neurotransmitter system involvement or of cerebellum neurodegeneration exerting a direct influence on cognitive and sensorial information processing in MJD.

Isolation and study of insulin activated nitric oxide synthase inhibitory protein in acute myocardial infarction subjects	JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND THROMBOLYSIS			English	Article						Acute ischemic heart disease; Atherosclerotic plaque; Nitric oxide; Thromboxane-A2; Insulin; Aspirin	HUMAN-BLOOD-PLATELETS; ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; PROSTAGLANDIN-E1/I2 RECEPTOR-ACTIVITY; SOLUBLE GUANYLATE-CYCLASE; CORONARY-ARTERY; PROSTACYCLIN RECEPTOR; METABOLIC MODULATION; UNSTABLE ANGINA; RISK-FACTORS	Insulin inhibits platelet aggregation through nitric oxide synthesis by stimulating platelet insulin activated nitric oxide synthase. Impaired platelet insulin activated nitric oxide synthase in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients had been reported and thus our aim was to identify and isolate the factors impairing insulin activated nitric oxide in acute myocardial infarction patients' plasma and study its effect on platelets aggregation in vitro. The insulin activated nitric oxide synthase inhibitor was identified as a protein and was purified from the plasma of AMI subjects using DEAE cellulose and Sephadex G-50 column, molecular weight determined by SDS-PAGE, nitric oxide quantified by methaemoglobin method, inhibitor protein quantified in plasma by immunoblot and ELISA, platelet aggregation studies done using an aggregometer, thromboxane-A2 in the platelets determined by radioimmunoassay, I-125-insulin radioligand binding studies done using normal subject platelets. The purified nitric oxide synthase inhibitor protein was similar to 66 kDa, concentration in AMI subjects' plasma varied from 114 to 9,090 mu M and was undetected in normal subjects' plasma. The inhibitor protein competes with insulin for insulin receptor binding sites. The Incubation of the normal subject PRP with 5.0 mu M inhibitor for 30 min followed by 0.4 mu M ADP addition caused platelet aggregation in vitro, 130 mu M aspirin or 400 mu U insulin/ml addition was able to abrogate 0.4 mu M ADP induced platelet aggregation even in the presence of 5.0 mu M inhibitor. A potent inhibitory protein against insulin activated nitric oxide synthase in platelets appears in circulation of AMI subjects impairing nitric oxide production, potentiating ADP induced platelet aggregation and increasing the thromboxane-A2 level in platelets.

The nature of diphosphonic acid is a key factor to determine the advantages of the radiopharmaceuticals. The purpose of this study is to optimize the linker chain between the imidazolyl and geminal diphosphonate group in the zoledronic acid (ZL) to develop novel single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bone imaging agent. Methods: A novel ZL derivative, 1-hydroxy-3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)propane-1,1-diyldiphosphonic acid (IPrDP), was successfully prepared and labeled with (99m)Tc in a high labeling yield. Biodistribution of (99m)Tc-IPrDP and (99m)Tc-ZL in normal mice were studied and compared. SPECT bone scanning was performed on the rabbit and a series of dynamic and static images were recorded by Philips SKY Light emission computed tomography. Results: In the biodistribution studies, (99m)Tc-IPrDP exhibits significant advantages on the bone resorption and the clearance from soft tissues compared with (99m)Tc-ZL. Kinetics of blood clearance in mice showed that T(1/2 alpha) and T(1/2 beta), of (99m)Tc-IPrDP were 1.47 min and 46.47 min, while those of (99m)Tc-ZL were 2.28 and 52.63 min respectively. Excellent images of the rabbit skeleton can be quickly obtained for (99m)Tc-IPrDP, which was faster than (99m)Tc-ZL and the clinically widely used bone imaging agent (99m)Tc-MDP (technetium-99m labeled with methylenediphosphonate). Conclusions: (99m)Tc-IPrDP possesses excellent characteristics for the potential application as a novel bone scanning agent. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The noradrenaline transporter (NAT) is a major target for antidepressant drugs, including reboxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor. Therefore, the development of a radiotracer for imaging of the NAT is desirable. In this study, NKJ64, a novel iodinated analog of reboxetine, was radiolabeled and evaluated as a potential single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) radiotracer for imaging the NAT in brain. Biological evaluation of the novel radiotracer, I-123/125-NKJ64, was carried out in rats using: in vitro ligand binding assays; in vitro and ex vivo autoradiography; in vivo biodistribution studies and ex vivo pharmacological blocking studies. I-125-NKJ64 displayed saturable binding with high affinity for NAT in cortical homogenates (K-D 5 4.82 +/- 0.87 nM, mean +/- SEM, n = 3). In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography showed the regional distribution of I-123-NKJ64 binding to be consistent with the known density of NAT in brain. Following i.v. injection there was rapid uptake of I-123-NKJ64 in brain, with maximum uptake of 2.93% +/- 0.14% (mean +/- SEM, n = 3) of the injected dose. The specific to nonspecific ratio (locus coeruleus: caudate putamen) of I-123-NKJ64 uptake measured by ex vivo autoradiography was 2.8 at 30 min post i.v. injection. The prior administration of reboxetine significantly reduced the accumulation of I-123-NKJ64 in the locus coeruleus (> 50% blocking). The data indicate that further evaluation of I-123-NKJ64 in nonhuman primates is warranted in order to determine its utility as a SPECT radiotracer for imaging of NAT in brain.

Antagonist Selective Modulation of Adenosine A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>3</sub> Receptor Pharmacology by the Food Dye Brilliant Black BN: Evidence for Allosteric Interactions	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							A(1)-ADENOSINE RECEPTOR; SIGNALING PATHWAY; PHOSPHOLIPASE-C; CIBACRON BLUE; LIVING CELLS; CHO-CELLS; AGONIST; 2-AMINO-3-BENZOYLTHIOPHENES; ENHANCERS; CALCIUM	Allosteric binding sites on the adenosine receptor family represent potential therapeutic targets for a number of conditions involving metabolic stress. This study has identified Brilliant Black BN as a novel allosteric modulator of the adenosine A 1 and A 3 receptors. In addition to being a food dye and pharmaceutical excipient, Brilliant Black BN is commonly used within calcium mobilization assays to quench extracellular fluorescence. Brilliant Black BN (5-500 mu M) had no significant effect on the calcium mobilization stimulated by the nonselective adenosine receptor agonist 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido) adenosine in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with the human adenosine A(1) or A(3) receptor. Likewise, calcium mobilization and radioligand binding assays found that Brilliant Black BN (5-500 mu M) did not significantly influence the antagonism mediated by 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (100 nM) at the A 1 receptor. In contrast, the affinity of N-[9-chloro-2-(2furanyl)[ 1,2,4]-triazolo[1,5-c] quinazolin-5-yl] benzene acetamide (MRS1220) at the A(3) receptor and xanthine amine congener (XAC) and XAC-X-BY630 at the A(1) and A(3) receptors was significantly decreased in the presence of 500 mu M Brilliant Black BN. A reduction in XAC potency at the A(1) and A(3) receptor was achieved within 1 min of Brilliant Black BN addition, despite receptors having been pre-equilibrated with antagonist. Dissociation kinetics of the fluorescent XAC derivative, XAC-XBY630, revealed that the decrease in affinity is probably due to a significant increase in dissociation rate of the antagonist in the presence of Brilliant Black BN. Taken together, these results suggest that Brilliant Black BN can act allosterically to modify ligand affinity at A(1) and A(3) receptors.	[May, L. T.; Briddon, S. J.; Hill, S.

DPA-714 and its tosyloxy derivative (NN-diethyl-2-(2-(4-(2-toluenesulfonyloxyethoxy)phenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide) as precursor for the labelling with fluorine-18 were synthesized in two steps from DPA-713 (N,N-diethyl-2-(2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-5,7-dimethylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-3-yl)acetamide) and obtained in 32 and 42% yields, respectively. [(18)FIDPA-714 was synthesized using a simple one-step process (a tosyloxy-for-fluorine nucleophilic aliphatic substitution), which has been fully automated on our Zymate-XP robotic system. It involves: (A) reaction of K[(18)F]F-Kryptofix 222 with the tosyloxy precursor (4.5-5.0 mg, 8.2-9.1 mu mol) at 165 degrees C for 5 min in dimethyl sufloxide (0.6ml.) followed by (B) C18 PrepSep cartridge pre-purification and finally (C) semi-preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification on a Waters X-Terra(TM) RP18. Typically, 5.6-7.4 GBq of [(18)F]DPA-714 (> 95% chemically and radiochemically pure) could be obtained with specific radioactivities ranging from 37 to 111 GBq/mu mol within 85-90 min (HPLC purification and SepPak (R)-based formulation included), starting from a 37GBq [(18)F]fluoride batch (overall non-decay-corrected and isolated radiochemical yield: 15-20%).

Recent studies demonstrate the applicability of the nAChR ligand 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 for neuroimaging of patients with dementias. However, its binding kinetics demands a 7-h acquisition time limiting its practicality for clinical PET studies. Thus, the authors developed [F-18]norchloro-fluorohomoepibatidine ([F-18]NCFHEB) for nAChR imaging. The kinetics of the two enantiomers of [18F]NCFHEB were compared with 2-[F-18]F-A85380 in porcine brain to evaluate their potential for human neuroimaging. Twenty-four juvenile female pigs were studied with PET using [18F]NCFHEB. Nine animals received an additional i.v. injection (1 mg/kg) of the nAChR agonist A81418 before radiotracer administration followed by infusion (2 mg/kg/7h) thereafter. Several compartment models were applied for quantification. (-)- and (+)-[F-18]NCFHEB showed a twofold to threefold higher brain uptake than 2-[F-18]F-A-85380. All three radiotracers displayed spatially hetereogenous binding kinetics in regions with high, moderate, or low specific binding. The equilibrium of specific binding of (-)-[18F]NCFHEB was reached earlier than that of (+)-[F-18]NCFHEB or 2-[F-18]F-A85380. Continuous administration of the nAChR agonist A81418 inhibited the specific binding of (-)- and (+)-[F-18]NCFHEB but not of 2[18 F]F-A85380. The peripheral metabolism of (+)-[F-18]NCFHEB proceeded somewhat slower than that of the other radiotracers. Both enantiomers of [F-18]NCFHEB are appropriate radiotracers for neuroimaging of nAChR in pigs. Their binding profile in vivo appears to be more selective than that of 2-[F-18]F-A85380. (-)-[F-18]NCFHEB offers a faster equilibrium of specific binding than 2-[18F]F-A85380.

To satisfy the different application purposes, MEN with well controlled physical forms in different size ranges are highly desirable. For examples, MIP nanoparticles are very suitable to be used to develop binding assays and for microfluidic separations, whereas MIP beads with diameter of 1.5-3 mu m can be more appropriate to use in new analytical liquid chromatography systems. Previous studies have demonstrated that imprinted microspheres and nanoparticles can be synthesized using a simple precipitation polymerization method. Despite that the synthetic method is straightforward, the final particle size obtained has been difficult to adjust for a given template. In this work, we initiated to study new synthetic conditions to obtain MIP beads with controllable size in the nano- to micro-meter range, using racemic propranolol as a model template. Varying the composition of the cross-linking monomer allowed the particle size of the MIP beads to be altered in the range of 130 nm to 2.4 mu m, whereas the favorable binding property of the imprinted beads remained intact. The chiral recognition sites were further characterized with equilibrium binding analysis using tritium-labeled (S)-propranolol as a tracer. In general, the imprinted sites displayed a high chiral selectivity: the apparent affinity of the (S)-imprinted sites for (S)-propranolol was 20 times that of for (R)-propranolol. Compared to previously reported irregular particles, the chiral selectivity of competitive radioligand binding assays developed from the present imprinted beads has been increased by six to seven folds in an optimized aqueous solvent.

Species selectivity of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist is conferred by two adjacent extracellular β4 amino acids that are implicated in the coupling of binding to channel gating	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							N-TERMINAL DOMAIN; SUBUNIT; EXPRESSION; DIVERSITY; RESIDUES; ALPHA-7; CONTRIBUTE; IDENTIFICATION; DETERMINANTS; SENSITIVITY	5-(Trifluoromethyl)-6-(1-methyl-azepan-4-yl)methyl-1H-quinolin-2- one (TMAQ) is a novel nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist with strong selectivity for beta 4-containing receptors. TMAQ also exhibits remarkable species selectivity, being a potent agonist of nAChRs containing the human beta 4 subunit but having no detectable agonist activity on nAChRs containing the rat beta 4 subunit. With the aim of identifying subunit domains and individual amino acids, which contribute to the species selectivity of TMAQ, a series of chimeric and mutated beta 4 subunits has been constructed. Recombinant receptors containing wild-type, chimeric, or mutated beta 4 subunits have been examined by radioligand binding, intracellular calcium assays, and electrophysiological recording. Two adjacent amino acids located within the extracellular loop D domain of the beta 4 subunit (amino acids 55 and 56) have been identified as playing a critical role in determining the agonist potency of TMAQ. Mutagenesis of these two residues within the rat beta 4 subunit to the corresponding amino acids in the human beta 4 subunit (S55N and I56V mutations) confers sensitivity to TMAQ. The converse mutations in the human beta 4 subunit (N55S and V56I) largely abolish sensitivity to TMAQ. In contrast, these mutations have little or no effect on sensitivity to the nonselective nicotinic agonist epibatidine. Despite acting as a potent agonist of human beta 4-containing nAChRs, TMAQ acts as an antagonist of rat beta 4-containing receptors. Our experimental data, together with homology models of the rat and human alpha 3 beta 4 nAChRs, suggest that amino acids 55 and 56 may be involved in the coupling of agonist binding and channel gating.

The aim of these studies is to compare in vitro and in vivo charactetistics of two novel STh analogs with appended DOTA chelating moieties. Materials and Methods: STh analogs were synthesized with pendant N-terminal DOTA moieties and radiolabeled with indium-111. In vitro cell binding was studied using cultured T-84 human colorectal cancer cells, and in vivo biodistribution studies were carried out using T84 human colorectal tumor xenografts in SCID mice. Results: Competitive radioligand binding assays employing T-84 human colon cancer cells demonstrated similar IC50 values for the F-19-STh(2-19) and F-9-STh(6-19) analogs. Addition of DOTA to the N-terminus of these peptides elicited distinctly different effects on binding affinities in vitro, effects that were largely unchanged by metallation with nonradioactive In-nat. In vivo pharmacokinetic studies in SCID mice beating T-84 human colon cancer-derived tumor xenografts demonstrated tumor uptake of 0.74 +/- 0.1 %ID/g at 4 h post-injection (p.i.) for the In-111-DOTA-F-19-STh(2-19) analog, and significantly reduced tumor localizzation (0.27 +/- 0.08 %ID/g) for the In-111-DOTA-F-9-STh(6-19) analog. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that placement of a DOTA moiety immediate adjacent to Cys 6 in STh significant inhibits receptor binding in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the need for intervening spacer residues between the pharmacophore and the DOTA chelating moiety in effective STh-based radiopharmaceutical constructs.

Based on molecular modeling studies, Aspartic acid (Asp)155[3.32] in transmembrane region III and Serine(Ser)361[7.46] in transmembrane region VII of the 5-HT2C receptor were found to interact with sarpogrelate. Asp3.32 and Ser7.46 were mutated to alanine (Ala) and expressed in COS-7 cells. The radioligand [H-3]mesulergine did not show any binding to Asp3.32A1a mutant of 5-HT2C receptor. Therefore, it was not possible to find any sarpogrelate affinity to the mutant using [H-3]mesulergine. The mutation also abolished agonist-stimulated IP formation of [H-3]myo-inositol. Introduction of dual mutation at position Ser7.46 (Asp3.32Ala-Ser7.46Ala) could not restore the function disrupted by the first mutation (Asp3.32Ala). On the other hand, the Ser7.46Ala mutant showed reduced binding affinity for [H-3] mesulergine (K-d 3557 pm versus 573 pm for the wild-type receptor) and had reduced affinity for sarpogrelate. Moreover, the Ser7.46Ala mutant receptor also showed a great loss of potency for sarpogrelate in inhibiting 5-HTstimulated IP formation of [H-3]myo-inositol. The results provide direct evidence that Asp3.32 and less importantly, Ser7.46 are responsible for the interaction between 5-HT2C receptor and [H-3] mesulergine as well as sarpogrelate. More interestingly, Ser7.46Ala increases the receptor expression (20-fold vs. wild-type) of the mutant receptors and basal [H-3]myo-inositol formation (2.5-fold vs. wild-type), which indicates that the 5-HT2C receptor could be rendered constitutively active by mutating the amino acid serine at position 7.46 to alanine.

In this study, we have examined the effects of sympathectomy on the subtypes of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in rat vas deferens in radioligand binding and functional studies. 2 In vehicle-treated tissues, antagonist displacement of [H-3]prazosin binding to alpha(1)-adrenoceptors was consistent with a single population of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. Binding affinities for a range of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor antagonists were expressed as pK(i) values and correlated with known affinities for alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes. The correlation was significant only with alpha(1A)-adrenoceptors. 3 In tissues from rats sympathectomised with 6-hydroxy-dopamine (2 x 100 mg kg(-1) i.p.), binding affinity for the alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor antagonist BMY 7378 fitted best with a two-site model. 4 In functional studies, the potency of noradrenaline at producing total (phasic plus tonic) but not tonic contractions was increased in tissues from sympathectomised rats. 5 Results obtained from sympathectomised rats suggest that phasic contractions are mainly alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor mediated, whereas tonic contractions are mainly alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor mediated, based on the effects of BMY 7378 and the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor antagonist RS 100329. 6 It is concluded that the predominant alpha(1)-adrenoceptor in vehicle-treated rat vas deferens is the alpha(1A)-adrenoceptor, both in terms of ligand binding and contractions to exogenous agonists. The alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor is only detectable by ligand binding following chemical sympathectomy, but is involved in noradrenaline-evoked contractions, particularly phasic contractions, of rat vas deferens.

J	Townsend, D; Portoghese, PS; Brown, DR				Townsend, D; Portoghese, PS; Brown, DR			Characterization of specific opioid binding sites in neural membranes from the myenteric plexus of porcine small intestine	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY AND EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							ENTERIC NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SPINAL-CORD; RECEPTOR; DELTA; KAPPA; ANTAGONIST; ILEUM; MU; LOCALIZATION; EFFICACY	delta- and kappa-Opioid receptors (OPRs), but not mu-OPRs, are expressed in the myenteric plexus of the porcine distal small intestine. In a subpopulation of myenteric neurons, delta- and kappa-OPRs seem to be colocalized and may functionally interact. In this study, radioligand binding was used to characterize myenteric OPR populations in detail. The nonselective OPR antagonist [H-3] diprenorphine bound to a single, high-affinity site in myenteric neural membrane homogenates. Naloxone displaced 65 and 59% of [H-3] diprenorphine binding from this site in Na+-free Tris and Krebs-HEPES buffers, respectively. Naltrexone-derived delta- and kappa-OPR antagonists, including naltriben, 7-benzylidenenaltrexone, nor-binaltorphimine, and 5'-guanidinonaltrindole, displaced [H-3] diprenorphine from two distinct binding sites to levels similar to that of naloxone. The selective delta-OPR ligands Tyr-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-Phe-Phe-OH (TIPP), [D-Pen(2), D-Pen(5)] enkephalin ( DPDPE), [D-Ala(2), Glu(4)] deltorphin II, and (+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha((2S,5R)-4- allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl-3-methoxybenzyl)-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC-80) and the kappa-OPR agonist (D-(5alpha,7alpha,8beta)-(-)-N-methyl-N-(7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxoaspiro-(4,5)dec-8-yl) benzeneacetamide (U-69,593) displaced [H-3] diprenorphine from three independent binding sites; these included high-affinity delta- and kappa-OPR sites, and a residual binding site. Residual [H-3] diprenorphine binding was displaced by the selective kappa-OPR antagonist nor-binaltorphimine after saturation of delta and kappa sites, respectively, with DPDPE and U-69,593. The residual binding site displayed low affinity for delta- and kappa-OPR agonists and TIPP, as well as moderate affinity for naltrexone-derived ligands, properties reminiscent of delta-/kappa-OPR heterodimers.

J	Uberti, MA; Hall, RA; Minneman, KP				Uberti, MA; Hall, RA; Minneman, KP			Subtype-specific dimerization of α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptors:: Effects on receptor expression and pharmacological properties	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							SK-N-MC; G-PROTEIN; CELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION; ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; OPIOID RECEPTORS; BINDING-SITES; MESSENGER-RNA; HUMAN TISSUES; HEK293 CELLS	The potential role of dimerization in controlling the expression and pharmacological properties of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes was examined using coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged receptors. Human alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes (alpha(1A), alpha(1B), alpha(1D)) were tagged at their amino-termini with Flag or hemagglutinin epitopes and transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Homodimerization of all three subtypes was observed by coimmunoprecipitation of receptors with different tags and was not altered by norepinephrine treatment. Heterodimer formation between hemagglutinin-tagged alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors and Flag-tagged alpha(1A)- or alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors was also observed. However, no alpha(1A)/alpha(1D)-adrenoceptor heterodimers were observed, suggesting that dimerization is subtype-specific. The extent of heterodimerization was also unaltered by norepinephrine treatment. alpha(1)-Adrenoceptor truncation mutants lacking carboxyl or amino-terminal sequences formed homo- and heterodimers similarly to full-length receptors, suggesting that these domains play little or no role in dimerization. Biotinylation with a membrane-impermeable agent showed that monomers and homo- and hetero-oligomers of all three subtypes are expressed on the cell surface. Radioligand binding studies showed that heterodimerization did not alter the affinity of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors for norepinephrine, prazosin, or subtype-selective antagonists, suggesting that dimerization does not result in pharmacologically distinct subtypes. However, coexpression of alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors significantly increased both binding site density and protein expression of alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, and increased cell surface expression of alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, suggesting a functional role for heterodimerization. Conversely, coexpression of alpha(1A)- with alpha(1D)-adrenoceptors, which did not heterodimerize, had no effect on receptor density or protein. These studies demonstrate subtype-selective heterodimerization of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors, which does not change their pharmacological properties but seems to have functional consequences in regulating receptor expression and trafficking.

Ten of the 12 mGlu3 mutants (R64A, R68A, Y150A, S151A, T174A, D194A, Y222A, R277A, D301A and K389) showed either no binding or a 90% or greater loss of specific [(3) H]DCG-IV binding. Several analogous mutations in mGlu2 supported the results obtained with mGlu3. These results demonstrate that the binding of [(3) H]DCG-IV to mGlu3 is exceptionally sensitive to mutagenesis-induced perturbations. In silico docking of DCG-IV into the agonist binding pocket of mGlu3 facilitated the interpretation the mutagenesis results. Tyrosines 150 and 222, and arginine 277 show close contacts with the third carboxylic acid group in DCG-IV, which is not present in glutamate or (2S ,1'S ,2'S )-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine (L-CCG-I). Mutation of these three amino acids to alanine resulted in a near complete loss of receptor activation by DCG-IV and retention of near wild-type affinity for L-CCG-I. It is proposed that hydrogen bonding between this carboxylate and tyrosines 150 and 222 and arginine 277 provide a partial explanation for the high affinity and Group II selectivity of DCG-IV. These findings define the essential features of the ligand-binding pocket of mGlu3 and, together with other recent studies on mGlu receptors, provide new opportunities for structure-based drug design.

Some toxic effects are thought to be the result of AHR-mediated changes in the expression of endocrine-related genes, such as the estrogen receptor and genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. Since little is known about endocrine factors that regulate AHR expression and function, we evaluated the effect of hypophysectomy (hypx) on these parameters in the liver of male rats. Cytosolic AHR immunoreactive protein was reduced in hypx rats to 61% of levels in sham-operated rats. Sucrose density gradient analysis of cytosolic AHR radioligand binding using a saturating concentration of [H-3]TCDD showed that ligand binding was reduced in hypx rats to 31% of sham levels. TCDD showed similar potency for transforming cytosolic AHR from hypx and sham rats to a DNA-binding form; however, maximal AHR DNA-binding was reduced in hypx rats to 57% of sham levels, although this did not achieve statistical significance. These changes observed at the protein level were not accompanied by a corresponding decrease in hypx rats of mRNA for AHR or the AHR nuclear translocator. Despite this change in AHR protein level, hypx rats were not compromised in hepatic cytochrome P450 1A1 induction following in vivo administration of MC. These data indicate that the AHR signaling pathway is intact in hypx rats and that a pituitary factor regulates hepatic AHR expression at the protein level. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

J	Wright, DH; Ford-Hutchinson, AW; Chadee, K; Metters, KM				Wright, DH; Ford-Hutchinson, AW; Chadee, K; Metters, KM			The human prostanoid DP receptor stimulates mucin secretion in LS174T cells	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						prostanoid receptor; DP; prostaglandin D-2; human; colon; mucin; LS174T	PROSTAGLANDIN-D RECEPTOR; ENTAMOEBA-HISTOLYTICA; MAST-CELLS; MESSENGER-RNA; RAT COLON; D-2; EXPRESSION; ACTIVATION; CLASSIFICATION; LEPTOMENINGES	1 This study demonstrates the localization of the prostaglandin (PG)D-2 receptor (DP) within the mucous-secreting globlet cells of the human colon by in situ hybridization, which suggests a role for DP in mucous secretion. Selective high affinity ligands were used, therefore, to evaluate DP regulation of mucous secretion in LS174T human colonic adenocarcinoma cells. 2 The expression of hDP in LS174T cells was confirmed at the mRNA level by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and at the protein level by radioligand binding assays and signal transduction (cyclic AMP accumulation) assays. PGD(2) and the highly selective DP-specific agonist L-644,698 ((4-(3-(3-(3-hydroxyoctyl)-4-oxo-2-thiazolidinyl) propyl) benzoic acid) (racemate), but not PGE(2) competed for [H-3]-PGD(2)-specific binding to LS174T cell membranes (K-i values of 0.4 nM and 7 nM, respectively). The DP-specific agonists PGD(2), PGJ(2), BW245C (5-(6-carboxyhexyl)-1-(3-cyclohexyl-3-hydroxypropylhydantoin)), and L-644,698 showed similar potencies in stimulating cyclic AMP accumulation (EC50 values: 45-90 nM) and demonstrated the expected rank order of potency. PGE(2) also elicited cyclic AMP production in this cell line (EC50 value: 162 nM). 3 The activation of cyclic AMP production by PGD(2) and L-644,698, but not PGE(2), was inhibited by the selective DP antagonist BW A868C. Thus, PGD(2) and L-644,698 act through hDP in LS174T cells. PGD(2), L-644,698 and PGE(2) tan established mucin secretagogue) potently stimulated mucin secretion in LS174T cells in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50<50nM). However, BW A868C effectively antagonized only the mucin secretion mediated by PGD(2) and L-644,698 and not PGE(2). These data support a role for the DP receptor in the regulation of mucous secretion.

Aim of this research was to determine whether the effects of beta-agonists on LPS-induced TNF alpha and IL-10 release are influenced by their different stereochemistry. In addition, the role of the beta-AR subtypes was studied. The effect of two stereoisomers of the selective beta(2)-AR agonist TA2005 [(R,R)- and (S,S)-] on the LPS-induced TNFa and IL-IO release by U937 macrophages was compared. The (R,R)-stereoisomer was 277 times more potent in inhibiting the TNFa release than the (S,S)-form. The (R,R)stereoisomer also appeared to be more potent in increasing the IL-IO release. In radioligand binding studies the affinity of (R,R)-TA2005 for the beta-adrenoceptor was 755 times higher than the (S,S)-TA2DOS stereoisomer. In addition, the elevation of intracellular cAMP in U937 cells appeared to be stereoselective: (R,R)-TA2005 was more potent in elevating intracellular cAMP. The effect of both stereoisomers on the LPS-induced TNFa release could almost completely be antagonized by preincubation with the selective beta(2)-AR-antagonist ICI-118551. Further evidence that the effect of the P-agonists is mediated via the beta(2)-adrenoceptor subtype exclusively was acquired by incubation of U937 cells with selective beta(1)- and beta(3)-agonists. None of these receptor subtype agonists showed significant suppressive effect on TNFa release. This study provides additional proof that the anti-inflammatory effects of beta(2)-agonists are mediated via the beta(2)-adrenoceptor and indicates that these effects are highly dependent on the stereoselectivity of the ligand.

Methods: Acute and chronic experiments were conducted in rats and the effects of the irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitor, phenelzine and the reversible MAO type-A inhibitors, moclobemide and brofaromine, on tryptamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine(2) receptors were analysed using radioligand binding techniques. In addition, activities of MAO-A and -B were determined radiochemically and brain and/or urine levels of tryptamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine(2) 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), beta-phenylethylamine, brofaromine and moclobemide were determined by chromatographic procedures. Results: After 30 days of administration, moclobemide and brofaromine selectively inhibited brain MAO-A activity and phenelzine inhibited MAO-A and -B to equal extents. All three drugs caused a significant down-regulation of tryptamine receptors, whereas only phenelzine significantly down-regulated 5-hydroxytryptamine, receptors, In a comparison of phenelzine and brofaromine, both caused marked elevations of urinary tryptamine and decreases of urinary MHPG levels, while only phenelzine increased P-phenylethylamine levels. After 14 days of administration, phenelzine, but not moclobemide or brofaromine, significantly increased levels of tryptamine in brain; all three drugs significantly increased 5-HT levels. Limitations: 24-h urine samples were not collected for moclobemide-treated animals and brain levels of tryptamine were not measured after 30-day administration. Conclusions: These studies revealed marked neurochemical differences among phenelzine, moclobemide and brofaromine which could contribute to their actions in the clinical setting.

Optimization of the radiation dosimetry protocol in Lutetium-177-PSMA therapy: toward clinical implementation	EJNMMI RESEARCH			English	Article						[Lu-177]Lu-PSMA; Dosimetry; Radionuclide therapy; Prostate cancer; mHSPC	RESISTANT PROSTATE-CANCER; RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; NORMAL ORGANS; LU-177-PSMA-617	BackgroundDosimetry in [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy is a valuable tool to assess treatment efficacy and toxicity. This study aims to develop a clinically implementable protocol to determine the absorbed dose in organs and tumor lesions after [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 therapy, by reducing the imaging time points and utilizing population-based kinetics with a single scan, with evaluation of its influence on the uncertainty in absorbed dose.MethodsTen patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer received two cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617. Post-treatment imaging was performed at 1 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 168 h, consisting of three-bed positions SPECT/CT and a whole-body planar scan. Five-time point SPECT dosimetry was performed for lesions and organs with physiological uptake (kidneys, liver and salivary glands) and used as the reference standard. Absorbed dose values for various simplified protocols were compared to the reference standard.ResultsAccurate lesion dosimetry is possible using one-time point SPECT imaging at 168 h, with an increase in uncertainty (20% vs. 14% for the reference standard). By including a second time point, uncertainty was comparable to the reference standard (13%). Organ dosimetry can be performed using a single SPECT at 24 h or 48 h. Dosimetry based on planar scans did not provide accurate dose estimations.ConclusionAccurate lesion dosimetry in [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA therapy can be performed using a one- or two-time point protocol, making dosimetry assessments more suitable for routine clinical implementation, although dosimetry based om multiple time points is more accurate.Clinical trial registration This study was approved by the Medical Review Ethics Committee Region Arnhem-Nijmegen on January 23, 2018 and was registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03828838).

Baseline Imaging Derived Predictive Factors of Response Following [<SUP>177</SUP>Lu]Lu-PSMA-617 Therapy in Salvage Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Lesion- and Patient-Based Analysis	BIOMEDICINES			English	Article						prostate cancer; lutetium; radio-ligand therapy; prostate specific membrane antigen; predictors	RADIOLIGAND THERAPY; CLINICAL-TRIALS; RECOMMENDATIONS; QUANTIFICATION; MULTICENTER; SURVIVAL; DESIGN; PET/CT	Earlier studies have mostly identified pre-therapeutic clinical and laboratory parameters for the prediction of treatment response to [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patients (mCRPC). The current study investigated whether imaging-derived factors on baseline [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT can potentially predict the response after two cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment, in a lesion- and patient-based analysis in men with mCRPC. Included patients had histologically proven mCRPC and a [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT before and after two cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment. The imaging-based response was evaluated on lesion-level (standardized uptake value (SUV) reduction) and patient-level (total lesion PSMA (TL-PSMA) reduction). In the lesion-level analysis, a clear relationship was found between SUVpeak/max and the imaging-based response to [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT (most avid lesion SUVpeak/max >= 30% reduction) (p < 0.001), with no significant difference in cut-off values between different sites of metastases (i.e., lymph node, bone or visceral metastasis). In patient-level analysis, baseline PSA and SUVpeak values of most avid metastasis were significantly associated with imaging-based response (TL-PSMA >= 30% reduction) (p = 0.019 and p = 0.015). In pre-treatment with [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT, a clear accumulation-response relationship in lesion-level was found for SUVpeak/max in men with mCRPC receiving two cycles of [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617 treatment. The SUVpeak of the most avid lesion was the only image-derived factor predictive of the imaging-based response at the patient-level.	[van der Sar, Esmee C. A.; Kuhr, Adinda J.

Although previous reports have indicated the effectiveness of hiPSC-NS/PCs transplantation into the injured spinal cord of rodents and nonhuman primates, long-term observation of hiPSC-NS/PCs post-transplantation suggested some "unsafe" differentiation-resistant properties, resulting in disordered overgrowth. These findings suggest that, even if "safe" NS/PCs are transplanted into the human central nervous system (CNS), the dynamics of cellular differentiation of stem cells should be noninvasively tracked to ensure safety. Positron emission tomography (PET) provides molecular-functional information and helps to detect specific disease conditions. The current study was conducted to visualize Nestin (an NS/PC marker)-positive undifferentiated neural cells in the CNS of immune-deficient (nonobese diabetic-severe combined immune-deficient) mice after hiPSC-NS/PCs transplantation with PET, using 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) ligands as labels. TSPO was recently found to be expressed in rodent NS/PCs, and its expression decreased with the progression of neuronal differentiation. We hypothesized that TSPO would also be present in hiPSC-NS/PCs and expressed strongly in residual immature neural cells after transplantation. The results showed high levels of TSPO expression in immature hiPSC-NS/PCs-derived cells, and decreased TSPO expression as neural differentiation progressed in vitro. Furthermore, PET with [F-18] FEDAC (a TSPO radioligand) was able to visualize the remnant undifferentiated hiPSC-NS/PCs-derived cells consisting of TSPO and Nestin(+) cells in vivo. These findings suggest that PET with [F-18] FEDAC could play a key role in the safe clinical application of CNS repair in regenerative medicine.

Oligoarginine Peptides, a New Family of Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Inhibitors	MOLECULAR PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							ALPHA-O-CONOTOXIN; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; CATIONIC POLYMERS; ACHBP; ARGININE; BINDING; NEUROTOXINS; SELECTIVITY; COMPLEX; SNAKE	Many peptide ligands of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) contain a large number of positively charged amino acid residues, a striking example being conotoxins RgIA and GeXIVA from marine mollusk venom, with an arginine content of >30%. To determine whether peptides built exclusively from arginine residues will interact with different nAChR subtypes or with their structural homologs such as the acetylcholine-binding protein and ligand-binding domain of the nAChR alpha 9 subunit, we synthesized a series of R3, R6, R8, and R16 oligoarginines and investigated their activity by competition with radioiodinated a-bungarotoxin, two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology, and calcium imaging. R6 and longer peptides inhibited muscle-type nAChRs, alpha 7 nAChRs, and alpha 3 beta 2 nAChRs in the micromolar range. The most efficient inhibition of ion currents was detected for muscle nAChR by R16 (IC50 = 157 nM) and for the alpha 9 alpha 10 subtype by R8 and R16 (IC50 = 44 and 120 nM, respectively). Since the R8 affinity for other tested nAChRs was 100-fold lower, R8 appears to be a selective antagonist of alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. For R8, the electrophysiological and competition experiments indicated the existence of two distinct binding sites on alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. Since modified oligoarginines and other cationic molecules are widely used as cell-penetrating peptides, we studied several cationic polymers and demonstrated their nAChR inhibitory activity. SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT By using radioligand analysis, electrophysiology, and calcium imaging, we found that oligoarginine peptides are a new group of inhibitors for muscle nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and some neuronal nAChRs, the most active being those with 16 and 8 Arg residues. Such compounds and other cationic polymers are cell-penetrating tools for drug delivery, and we also demonstrated the inhibition of nAChRs for several of the latter. Possible positive and negative consequences of such an action should be taken into account.

The overexpression of the serine protease fibroblast activation protein (FAP) allows a selective targeting of a variety of tumors by inhibitor-based radiopharmaceuticals (FAPIs). Of these compounds, FAPI-04 has been recently introduced as a theranostic radiotracer and demonstrated high uptake into different FAP-positive tumors in cancer patients. To enable the delivery of higher doses, thereby improving the outcome of a therapeutic application, several FAPI variants were designed to further increase tumor uptake and retention of these tracers. Methods: Novel quinoline-based radiotracers were synthesized by organic chemistry and evaluated in radioligand binding assays using FAP-expressing HT-1080 cells. Depending on their in vitro performance, small-animal PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed on HT-1080-FAP tumor-bearing mice. The most promising compounds were used for clinical PET imaging in 8 cancer patients. Results: Compared with FAPI-04, 11 of 15 FAPI derivatives showed improved FAP binding in vitro. Of these, 7 compounds demonstrated increased tumor uptake in tumor-bearing mice. Moreover, tumor-to-normal-organ ratios were improved for most of the compounds, resulting in images with higher contrast. Notably two of the radiotracers, FAPI-21 and -46, displayed substantially improved ratios of tumor to blood, liver, muscle, and intestinal uptake. A first diagnostic application in cancer patients revealed high intratumoral uptake of both radiotracers already 10 min after administration but a higher uptake in oral mucosa, salivary glands, and thyroid for FAPI-21. Conclusion: Chemical modification of the FAPI framework enabled enhanced FAP binding and improved pharmacokinetics inmost of the derivatives, resulting in high-contrast images. Moreover, higher doses of radioactivity can be delivered while minimizing damage to healthy tissue, which may improve therapeutic outcome.

The aim of this study was to evaluate neuroinflammation in a mouse MS model (EAE) using TSPO-PET with F-18-VC701, in combination with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods: MOG(35-55)/CFA and pertussis toxin protocol was used to induce EAE in C57BL/6 mice. Disease progression was monitored daily, whereas MRI evaluation was performed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks post-induction. Microglia activation was assessed in vivo by F-18-VC701 PET at the time of maximum disease score and validated by radioligand ex vivo distribution and immunohistochemistry at 2 and 4 weeks post-immunization. Results: In vivo and ex vivo analyses show that F-18-VC701 significantly accumulates within the central nervous system (CNS), particularly in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, and cervical spinal cord of EAE compared to control mice, at 2 weeks post-immunization. MRI confirmed the presence of focal brain lesions at 2 weeks post-immunization in both T1-weighted and T2 images. Of note, MRI abnormalities attenuated in later post-immunization phase. Neuropathological analysis confirmed the presence of microglial activation in EAE mice, consistent with the in vivo increase of F-18-VC701 uptake. Conclusion: Increase of F-18-VC701 uptake in EAE mice is strongly associated with the presence of microglia activation in the acute phase of the disease. The combined use of TSPO-PET and MRI provided complementary evidence on the ongoing disease process, thus representing an attractive new tool to investigate neuronal damage and neuroinflammation at preclinical levels.

In order to study the role of CH3 and OH moieties trisubstituted tetrahydro-3-benzazepines 4 were designed as missing link between tetra- and disubstituted 3-benzazepines 2 and 5. The synthesis of 4 comprises eight reaction steps starting from alanine. The intramolecular Friedel-Crafts acylation to obtain the ketone 12 and the base-catalyzed elimination of trifluoromethanesulfinate (CF3SO2-) followed by NaBH4 reduction represent the key steps. The GluN2B affinity of the cis-configured 3-benzazepin-1-ol cis-4a with a 4-phenylbutyl side chain (K-i = 252 nM) is considerably lower than the GluN2B affinity of (R,R)-2 (K-i = 17 nM) indicating the importance of the phenolic OH moiety for the interaction with the receptor protein. Introduction of an additional CH3 moiety in 2-position led to a slight decrease of GluN2B affinity as can be seen by comparing the affinity data of cis-4a and 5. The homologous phenylpentyl derivative cis-4b shows the highest GluN2B affinity (K-i = 56 nM) of this series of compounds. According to docking studies cis-4a adopts the same binding mode as the cocrystallized ligand ifenprodil-keto 1A and 5 at the interface of the GluN2B and GluN1a subunits. The same crucial H-bonds are formed between the C(=O) NH2 moiety of Gln110 within the GluN2B subunit and the protonated amino moiety and the OH moiety of (R,R)-cis-4a. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Receptor binding kinetics equations: Derivation using the Laplace transform method	JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGICAL AND TOXICOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						Methods; Receptor binding kinetics; Receptor theory; Data analysis; Ligand binding; Drug discovery; Drug kinetics; Residence time	RATE CONSTANTS; COMPETITION KINETICS; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; DISSOCIATION RATE; RESIDENCE TIME; ANTAGONISTS; RADIOLIGAND; LIGANDS; TITRATION; EFFICACY	Introduction: Measuring unlabeled ligand receptor binding kinetics is valuable in optimizing and understanding drug action. Unfortunately, deriving equations for estimating kinetic parameters is challenging because it involves calculus; integration can be a frustrating barrier to the pharmacologist seeking to measure simple rate parameters. Here, a well-known tool for simplifying the derivation, the Laplace transform, is applied to models of receptor-ligand interaction. The method transforms differential equations to a form in which simple algebra can be applied to solve for the variable of interest, for example the concentration of ligand-bound receptor. Methods: The goal is to provide instruction using familiar examples, to enable investigators familiar with handling equilibrium binding equations to derive kinetic equations for receptor-ligand interaction. First, the Laplace transform is used to derive the equations for association and dissociation of labeled ligand binding. Next, its use for unlabeled ligand kinetic equations is exemplified by a full derivation of the kinetics of competitive binding equation. Finally, new unlabeled ligand equations are derived using the Laplace transform. These equations incorporate a pre-incubation step with unlabeled or labeled ligand. Results: Four equations for measuring unlabeled ligand kinetics were compared and the two new equations verified by comparison with numerical solution. Importantly, the equations have not been verified with experimental data because no such experiments are evident in the literature. Equations were formatted for use in the curve-fitting program GraphPad Prism 6.0 and fitted to simulated data. Discussion: This description of the Laplace transform method will enable pharmacologists to derive kinetic equations for their model or experimental paradigm under study. Application of the transform will expand the set of equations available for the pharmacologist to measure unlabeled ligand binding kinetics, and for other time-dependent pharmacological activities.

The main objectives of this positron emission tomography (PET) study were to investigate the serotonin transporter binding potential (SERT BPND) in patients with ADHD and to assess associations of SERT BPND between the brain regions. 25 medication-free patients with ADHD (age +/- SD; 32.39 +/- 10.15; 10 females) without any psychiatric comorbidity and 25 age and sex matched healthy control subjects (33.74 +/- 10.20) were measured once with PET and the highly selective and specific radioligand [C-11]DASB. SERT BPND maps in nine a priori defined ROIs exhibiting high SERT binding were compared between groups by means of a linear mixed model. Finally, adopted from structural and functional connectivity analyses, we performed correlational analyses using regional SERT binding potentials to examine molecular interregional associations between all selected ROIs. We observed significant differences in the interregional correlations between the precuneus and the hippocampus in patients with ADHD compared to healthy controls, using SERT BPND of the investigated ROIs (P<0.05; Bonferroni corrected). When correlating SERT BPND and age in the ADHD and the healthy control group, we confirmed an age-related decline in brain SERT binding in the thalamus and insula (R-2=0.284, R-2=0.167, Ps<0.05; Bonferroni corrected). The results show significantly different interregional molecular associations of the SERT expression for the precuneus with hippocampus in patients with ADHD, indicating presumably altered functional coupling. Altered interregional coupling between brain regions might be a sensitive approach to demonstrate functional and molecular alterations in psychiatric conditions. Hum Brain Mapp 38:792-802, 2017.

To assess the potential of F-18-FPEB for longitudinal mGluR5 evaluation in patient studies, we evaluated the long-term test-retest reproducibility using various kinetic models in the human brain. Nine healthy volunteers underwent consecutive scans separated by a 6-month period. Dynamic PET was combined with arterial sampling and radiometabolite analysis. Total distribution volume (V-T) and nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) were derived from a two-tissue compartment model without constraints (2TCM) and with constraining the K-1/k(2) ratio to the value of either cerebellum (2TCM-CBL) or pons (2TCM-PONS). The effect of fitting different functions to the tracer parent fractions and reducing scan duration were assessed. Regional absolute test-retest variability (aTRV), coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were computed. The 2TCM-CBL showed best fits. The mean 6-month aTRV of V-T ranged from 8 to 13% (CR<25%) with ICC>0.6 for all kinetic models. BPND from 2TCM-CBL with a sigmoid fit for the parent fractions showed the best reproducibility, with aTRV <= 7% (CR<16%) and ICC>0.9 in most regions. Reducing the scan duration from 90 to 60 min did not affect reproducibility. These results demonstrate for the first time that F-18-FPEB brain PET has good long-term reproducibility, therefore validating its use to monitor mGluR5 expression in longitudinal clinical studies. We suggest a 2TCM-CBL with fitting a sigmoid function to the parent fractions to be optimal for this tracer. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Glutamate overactivity is well documented in PD and LID. An approach to manage LID is to add to L-DOPA specific agents to reduce dyskinesias such as metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGlu receptor) drugs. This article reviews the contribution of mGlu type 5 (mGlu5) receptors in animal models of PD. Several mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators acutely attenuate LID in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkeys and 6-hydroxydopamine(6-OHDA)-lesioned rats. Chronic administration of mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators to MPTP monkeys and 6-OHDA rats also attenuates LID while maintaining the antiparkinsonian effect of L-DOPA. Radioligand autoradiography shows an elevation of striatal mGlu5 receptors of dyskinetic L-DOPA-treated MPTP monkeys but not in those without LID. The brain molecular correlates of the long-term effect of mGlu5 negative allosteric modulators treatments with L-DOPA attenuating development of LID was shown to extend beyond mGlu5 receptors with normalization of glutamate activity in the basal ganglia of L-DOPA-induced changes of NMDA, AMPA, mGlu2/3 receptors and VGlut2 transporter. In the basal ganglia, mGlu5 receptor negative allosteric modulators also normalize the L-DOPA-induced changes of dopamine D-2 receptors, their associated signaling proteins (ERK1/2 and Akt/GSK3 beta) and neuropeptides (preproenkephalin, preprodynorphin) as well as the adenosine A(2A) receptors expression.

However, aberrant chemokine signaling is linked to different disorders such as cancer, central nervous system and immune disorders, and viral infections [Scholten DJ et al. (2012) Br J Pharmacol 165(6):1617-1643]. Modulating the chemokine receptor function provides new ways of targeting specific diseases. Therefore, discovery and development of drugs targeting chemokine receptors have received considerable attention from the pharmaceutical industry in the past decade. Along with that, the determination of bioactivities of individual metabolites derived from lead compounds towards chemokine receptors is crucial for drug selectivity, pharmacodynamics, and potential toxicity issues. Therefore, advanced analytical methodologies are in high demand. This study is aimed at the optimization of a new analytical method for metabolic profiling with parallel bioaffinity assessment of CXCR3 ligands of the azaquinazolinone and piperazinyl-piperidine class and their metabolites. The method is based on mass spectrometric (MS) identification after liquid chromatographic (LC) separation of metabolic mixtures. The bioaffinity assessment is performed "at-line" via high-resolution nanofractionation onto 96-well plates allowing direct integration of radioligand binding assays. This new method enables identification of metabolites from lead compounds with associated estimation of their individual bioaffinity. Moreover, the identification of the metabolite structures via accurate mass measurements and MS2 allows the identification of liable metabolic "hotspots" for further lead optimization. The efficient combination of chemokine receptor ligand binding assays with analytical techniques, involving nanofractionation as linking technology, allows implementation of comprehensive metabolic profiling in an early phase of the drug discovery process.

Similar striatal D2/D3 dopamine receptor availability in adults with Tourette syndrome compared with healthy controls: A [<SUP>11</SUP>C]-(+)-PHNO and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]raclopride positron emission tomography imaging study	HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING			English	Article						basal ganglia; corpus striatum; neostriatum; dopamine; receptors; dopamine; receptors; dopamine D2; positron-emission tomography; raclopride; Tourette syndrome	OBSESSIVE COMPULSIVE SCALE; HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; PET; BRAIN; BINDING; SYSTEM; NEUROTRANSMISSION; TRANSMISSION; INDIVIDUALS; PARVALBUMIN	Pharmacological and anatomical evidence implicates striatal dopamine receptors in Tourette syndrome (TS). Nevertheless, results of positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the dopamine system in TS have been inconsistent. We investigated striatal D2/3 dopamine receptors in TS using the radioligands [C-11]raclopride and [C-11]-(+)-PHNO, an agonist that binds preferentially to D3 receptors, thus allowing higher sensitivity and measurement of receptors in a high affinity state. Eleven adults with TS and 11 matched healthy control (HC) participants underwent [C-11]raclopride and [C-11]-(+)-PHNO PET scans. General linear model was used for voxelwise contrasts of striatal binding potentials (BPND) between TS and HC participants. Analysis of variance was performed to investigate main effect of radioligand. In addition, BPND values were extracted for ventral, motor, and associative striatum. Finally, we examined the relationship between BPND measures and symptom severity in TS participants. Main effects analyses showed that [C-11]-(+)-PHNO BPND was higher in ventral striatum, whereas [C-11]raclopride BPND was higher in motor and associative striatum. There were no significant group differences between TS and HC. Furthermore, TS and HC participants had similar [C-11]-(+)-PHNO and [C-11]raclopride BPND in the three striatal subregions. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between BPND and symptom severity. TS and HC participants had similar striatal D2/3 receptor availability measures. These results challenge the assumption that striatal dopamine receptors have a major role in the pathophysiology of TS. Consistent with previous findings, [C-11]-(+)-PHNO localized preferentially to ventral striatal, D3 receptor-rich regions, in contrast to [C-11]raclopride, which localized preferentially in the dorsal striatum.

Analgesic effect of a mixed T-type channel inhibitor/CB<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist	MOLECULAR PAIN			English	Article						T-type Channels; Cannabinoid Receptors; Pain; Patch-Clamp; Mice	GATED CALCIUM-CHANNELS; CANNABINOID RECEPTOR; FORMALIN TEST; PAIN; INHIBITION; MICE; NEURONS; TARGETS; ETHOSUXIMIDE; MECHANISMS	Background: Cannabinoid receptors and T-type calcium channels are potential targets for treating pain. Here we report on the design, synthesis and analgesic properties of a new mixed cannabinoid/T-type channel ligand, NMP-181. Results: NMP-181 action on CB1 and CB2 receptors was characterized in radioligand binding and in vitro GTP gamma[S-35] functional assays, and block of transiently expressed human Cav3.2 T-type channels by NMP-181 was analyzed by patch clamp. The analgesic effects and in vivo mechanism of action of NMP-181 delivered spinally or systemically were analyzed in formalin and CFA mouse models of pain. NMP-181 inhibited peak Ca(V)3.2 currents with IC50 values in the low micromolar range and acted as a CB2 agonist. Inactivated state dependence further augmented the inhibitory action of NMP-181. NMP-181 produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect when administered either spinally or systemically in both phases of the formalin test. Both i.t. and i.p. treatment of mice with NMP-181 reversed the mechanical hyperalgesia induced by CFA injection. NMP-181 showed no antinocieptive effect in Ca(V)3.2 null mice. The antinociceptive effect of intrathecally delivered NMP-181 in the formalin test was reversed by i.t. treatment of mice with AM-630 (CB2 antagonist). In contrast, the NMP-181-induced antinociception was not affected by treatment of mice with AM-281 (CB1 antagonist). Conclusions: Our work shows that both T-type channels as well as CB2 receptors play a role in the antinociceptive action of NMP-181, and also provides a novel avenue for suppressing chronic pain through novel mixed T-type/cannabinoid receptor ligands.

The therapeutic benefit of H-3 antagonists/inverse agonists may be hampered by disruption of sleep that has been observed in humans with prolonged high H-3 receptor occupancy (H3RO), extending into night-time. AZD5213 is a highly selective H-3 antagonist (in vitro inverse agonist) developed to achieve a pharmacokinetic profile permitting circadian fluctuations of H3RO. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in rodent behavioural models of cognition. In human subjects, AZD5213 was safe and well tolerated following repeated doses (1-14 mg/d) and demonstrated a short (similar to 5 h) half-life. In this PET study H3RO was measured using the radioligand [C-11] GSK189254 ([C-11] AZ12807110) in seven young male volunteers following single doses of AZD5213 (0.05-30 mg). H3RO was calculated using the Lassen plot method. The plasma concentrations and the affinity constant (K-i,K-pl 1.14 nmol/l, corresponding to the plasma concentration required to occupy 50% of available receptors) were used to estimate the H3RO time-course. AZD5213 showed dose and concentration dependent H3RO ranging from 16 to 90%. These binding characteristics and the pharmacokinetic profile of AZD5213 indicate that high daytime and low night-time H3RO could be achieved following once daily oral dosing of AZD5213. Fluctuations of H3RO following circadian rhythm of the histamine system may be expected to reduce the risk of sleep disruption while maintaining daytime efficacy. AZD5213 may thus be an optimal compound to evaluate the clinical benefit of selective H-3 antagonism in cognitive disorders.

Expression in MCF-7 Breast Cancer Cells Is Down-Regulated by Antiestrogens <i>In Vitro</i> and in Xenografts	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; PROGESTERONE-RECEPTOR; ENDOCRINE THERAPY; HIGHLY POTENT; PEPTIDE-YY; PROTEIN; ALPHA; ANTAGONISTS; AFFINITY; CLONING	The neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y-1 receptor (Y1R) has been suggested as a tumor marker for in vivo imaging and as a therapeutic target. In view of the assumed link between estrogen receptor (ER) and Y1R in mammary carcinoma and with respect to the development of new diagnostic tools, we investigated the Y1R protein expression in human MCF-7 cell variants differing in ER content and sensitivity against antiestrogens. ER and Y1R expression were quantified by radioligand binding using [H-3]-17 beta-estradiol and the Y1R selective antagonist [H-3]-UR-MK114, respectively. The latter was used for cellular binding studies and for autoradiography of MCF-7 xenografts. The fluorescent ligands Cy5-pNPY (universal Y1R, Y2R and Y5R agonist) and UR-MK22 (selective Y1R antagonist), as well as the selective antagonists BIBP3226 (Y1R), BIIE0246 (Y2R) and CGP71683 (Y5R) were used to identify the NPY receptor subtype(s) by confocal microscopy. Y1R functionality was determined by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Sensitivity of MCF-7 cells against antiestrogen 4-hydroxytamoxifen correlated directly with the ER content. The exclusive expression of Y(1)Rs was confirmed by confocal microscopy. The Y1R protein was up-regulated (100%) by 17 beta-estradiol (EC50 20 pM) and the predominant role of ER alpha was demonstrated by using the ER alpha-selective agonist "propylpyrazole triol". 17 beta-Estradiol-induced over-expression of functional Y1R protein was reverted by the antiestrogen fulvestrant (IC50 5 nM) in vitro. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment of nude mice resulted in an almost total loss of Y(1)Rs in MCF-7 xenografts. In conclusion, the value of the Y1R as a target for therapy and imaging in breast cancer patients may be compromised due to Y1R down-regulation induced by hormonal (antiestrogen) treatment.

Blockade of β-adrenoceptors restores the GRK2-mediated adrenal α<sub>2</sub>-adrenoceptor-catecholamine production axis in heart failure	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						heart failure; sympathetic overactivity; adrenal GRK2; catecholamines; beta-blocker	COUPLED RECEPTOR KINASE-2; DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY; IN-VIVO; PLASMA NOREPINEPHRINE; CARDIAC-FUNCTION; THERAPY; METOPROLOL; GRK2; MODULATION; RELEASE	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Sympathetic nervous system (SNS) hyperactivity is characteristic of chronic heart failure (HF) and significantly worsens prognosis. The success of beta-adrenoceptor antagonist (beta-blockers) therapy in HF is primarily attributed to protection of the heart from the noxious effects of augmented catecholamine levels. beta-Blockers have been shown to reduce SNS hyperactivity in HF, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not understood. The GPCR kinase-2 (GRK2)alpha(2)adrenoceptor-catecholamine production axis is up-regulated in the adrenal medulla during HF causing alpha(2)-adrenoceptor dysfunction and elevated catecholamine levels. Here, we sought to investigate if beta-blocker treatment in HF could lower SNS activation by directly altering adrenal GRK2 levels. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Four weeks after myocardial infarction-induced HF, adult rats were randomized to 10-week treatment with vehicle (HF/C) or bisoprolol (HF/B). Cardiac function and dimensions were measured. In heart and adrenal gland, GRK2 levels were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blotting and adrenoceptors studied with radioligand binding. Catecholamines and alpha(2)adrenoceptors in adrenal medulla chromaffin cell cultures were also measured. KEY RESULTS Bisoprolol treatment ameliorated HF-related adverse cardiac remodelling and reduced plasma catecholamine levels, compared with HF/C rats. Bisoprolol also attenuated adrenal GRK2 overexpression as observed in HF/C rats and increased alpha(2)adrenoceptor density. In cultures of adrenal medulla chromaffin cells from all study groups, bisoprolol reversed HF-related alpha(2)adrenoceptor dysfunction. This effect was reversed by GRK2 overexpression. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS Blockade of beta-adrenoceptors normalized the adrenal alpha(2)adrenoceptor-catecholamine production axis by reducing GRK2 levels. This effect may contribute significantly to the decrease of HF-related sympathetic overdrive by beta-blockers.

In order to explore putative functional differences between the Y1 and Y2 receptors we generated reciprocal chimeras by swapping the third intracellular loop, the carboxy terminus or both between human Y1 and Y2. Internalization was studied in a quantitative radioligand binding assay with removal of surface-bound ligand in an acidic-wash procedure. The internalization assay revealed a lower degree of internalization as well as slower kinetics for the Y2 receptor. Generally, reciprocal exchange of receptor segments did not convey properties of the donor receptor but tended to enhance internalization. Surprisingly, insertion of the Y2 carboxy terminus into Y1 gave almost complete internalization (92%), rather than reduced internalization, while the insertion of both segments resulted in internalization equal to the native Y1 receptor. These findings were confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of immuno-stained receptors tagged with a C-terminal FLAG epitope. However, after exposure to high agonist concentrations (100 nM) Y2 was internalized. Studies of Y2 and the closely related Y7 receptor confirmed low internalization for Y2 from chicken and teleost fishes as well as Y7 from two teleosts. The conservation across species of low internalization at physiological concentrations suggests that this is an ancient feature and of vital importance for Y2 function. We propose that amino acid motifs in the third intracellular loop as well as the C terminus of both Y1 and Y2 are able to drive agonist-promoted internalization and that there may be constraining motifs in the Y2 receptor.

Pharmacological characterization of six trkB antibodies reveals a novel class of functional agents for the study of the BDNF receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						BDNF; trkB receptor; functional ligand; agonist; antagonist; antibody; brain disease; cancer	NERVE GROWTH-FACTOR; TYROSINE KINASE; LOW-AFFINITY; NGF BINDING; NEUROTROPHINS; EXPRESSION; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; METASTASIS; REQUIRES; ANOIKIS	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE By interacting with trkB receptors, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) triggers various signalling pathways responsible for neurone survival, differentiation and modulation of synaptic transmission. Numerous reports have implicated BDNF and trkB in the pathogenesis of various central nervous system affections and in cancer, thus representing trkB as a promising therapeutic target. In this study, we used an antibody-based approach to search for trkB-selective functional reagents. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Six commercially available polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were tested on recombinant and native, human and rodent trkB receptors. Functional and pharmacological characterization was performed using a modified version of the KIRA-elisa method and radioligand binding studies. Western blot analyses and neurite outgrowth assays were carried out to determine the specificity and selectivity of antibody effects. The survival properties of one antibody were further assessed on cultured neurones in a serum-deprived paradigm. KEY RESULTS The functional trkB-selective antibodies showed distinct pharmacological profiles, ranging from partial agonists to antagonists, acting on trkB receptors through allosteric modulations. The same diversity of effects was observed on the mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling pathway downstream of trkB and on the subsequent neurite outgrowth. One antibody with partial agonist activity demonstrated cell survival properties by activating the Akt pathway. Finally, these antibodies were functionally validated as true trkB-selective ligands because they failed activating trkA or trkC, and contrary to BDNF, none of them bind to p75NTR. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS These trkB-selective antibodies represent a novel class of pharmacological tools to explore the pathophysiological roles of trkB and its potential therapeutic relevance for the treatment of various disorders.

Actions of thalidomide in producing vascular relaxations	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Thalidomide; Blood pressure; Hypotension; Postural hypotension; T-type calcium channels, NNC 55-0396; Mibefradil; alpha(1)-adrenoceptor	HEART-FAILURE PATIENTS; RAT TAIL ARTERY; SMOOTH-MUSCLE; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; CA2+ CHANNELS; PHASE-II; HETEROGENEITY; ALPHA-2-ADRENOCEPTORS; PATHWAY; AORTA	We have investigated the cardiovascular actions of thalidomide in vivo and in vitro. Blood pressure was recorded in pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats. Isometric contractions were examined in rings of rat tail artery and aorta. Radioligand binding studies of alpha(1A)- and alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor sites were carried out in membranes of rat submandibular gland and spleen, respectively. In pentobarbitone anaesthetized rats, thalidomide and the T-type calcium channel blocker NNC55-0396 (both 1 mg/kg, iv.) significantly reduced blood pressure. In rat tail artery, thalidomide (10-100 uM) produced relaxations of phenylephrine (1 uM) induced contractions. Also in tail artery, thalidomide (100 uM) significantly reduced the contraction to phenylephrine (1 mu M), but not KCl (40 mM), produced by calcium restoration, and NNC55-0396 (100 uM) had similar actions to thalidomide. Glibenclamide (10 uM), calphostin C (1 uM) or SB203580 (1 uM) failed to affect the inhibitory actions of thalidomide, and thalidomide did not affect contractions to caffeine (10 mM). Ligand binding studies found no evidence for alpha(1A)- or alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor affinity of thalidomide, and functional studies in rat aorta found no evidence for eturadrenoceptor affinity. It is concluded that thalidomide has previously unreported vascular relaxant actions. Relaxant actions in vitro do not seem to involve aradrenoceptors, caffeine sensitive calcium stores, glibenclamide sensitive potassium channels, protein kinase C (PKC) or P38 mitogen activated protein kinase (P38 MAP kinase). However, actions of thalidomide resembled those of the T-type calcium channel blocker NNC 55-0396. Further study is necessary to establish the mode of action of thalidomide in causing relaxations.

The M<sub>3</sub>-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor stimulates glucose uptake in L6 skeletal muscle cells by a CaMKK-AMPK-dependent mechanism	CELLULAR SIGNALLING			English	Article						AMPK; Skeletal muscle; Muscarinic receptor; Acetylcholine; L6; Glucose uptake	ACTIVATED PROTEIN-KINASE; FATTY-ACID OXIDATION; COUPLED RECEPTORS; MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; MESSENGER-RNA; I CASCADE; RAT-LIVER; BETA; PHOSPHORYLATION; TRANSPORT	The role of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in regulating glucose uptake in L6 skeletal muscle cells was investigated. [H-3]-2-Deoxyglucose uptake was increased in differentiated L6 cells by insulin, acetylcholine, oxotremorine-M and carbachol. mAChR-mediated glucose uptake was inhibited by the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. Whole cell radioligand binding using [H-3]-N-methyl scopolamine chloride identified mAChRs in differentiated but not undifferentiated L6 cells and M-3 mAChR mRNA was detected only in differentiated cells. M-3 mAChRs are Gq-coupled, and cholinergic stimulation by the rnAChR agonists acetylcholine, oxotremorine-M and carbachol increased Ca2+ in differentiated but not undifferentiated L6 cells. This was due to muscarinic but not nicotinic activation as responses were antagonised by the muscarinic antagonist atropine but not the nicotinic antagonist tubocurarine. Western blotting showed that both carbachol and the AMPK activator AICAR increased phosphorylation of the AMPK alpha subunit at Thr172, with responses to carbachol blocked by Compound C and the CaMKK inhibitor STO609 but not by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. AICAR-stimulated AMPK phosphorylation was not sensitive to STO-609, confirming that this compound inhibits CaMKK but not the classical AMPK kinase LKB1. The TAK1 inhibitor (5Z)-7-oxozeaenol and the G(i) inhibitor pertussis toxin both failed to block AMPK phosphorylation in response to carbachol. Using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing each of the mAChR subtypes (M-1-M-4), it was determined that only the M-1 and M-3 mAChRs phosphorylate AMPK, confirming a G(q)-dependent mechanism. This study demonstrates that activation of M-3 mAChRs in L6 skeletal muscle cells stimulates glucose uptake via a CaMKK-AMPK-dependent mechanism, independent of the insulin-stimulated pathway.

Methods The compound was tested against a wide range of receptors, ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters in radioligand binding assays. Analgesic activity was evaluated using the capsaicin pain model. Metabolism by rat and human liver microsomes was investigated, and the metabolites were identified by a variety of analytical techniques. Key findings 1'-Benzyl-3-methoxy-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine] (compound 1) is a potent sigma(1) receptor ligand (K-i 1.14 nM) with extraordinarily high sigma(1)/sigma(2) selectivity (>1100). It was selective for the sigma(1) receptor over more than 60 other receptors, ion channels and neurotransmitter transporters, and did not interact with the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) cardiac potassium channel. Compound 1 displayed analgesic activity against neuropathic pain in the capsaicin pain model (53% analgesia at 16 mg/kg), indicating that it is a sigma(1) receptor antagonist. It was rapidly metabolised by rat liver microsomes. Seven metabolites were unequivocally identified; an N-debenzylated metabolite and a hydroxylated metabolite were the major products. Pooled human liver microsomes formed the same metabolites. Studies with seven recombinant cytochrome P450 isoenzymes revealed that CYP3A4 produced all the metabolites identified. The isoenzyme CYP2D6 was inhibited by I (IC50 88 nM) but did not produce any metabolites. Conclusions 1'-Benzyl-3-methoxy-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine] is a potent and selective sigma(1) receptor antagonist, which is rapidly metabolised. Metabolically more stable sigma(1) ligands could be achieved by stabilising the N-benzyl substructure.

Previous studies have demonstrated antagonistic interactions between striatal H-3 and dopamine D-1 receptors at the biochemical level, while contradictory results have been reported about interactions between striatal H-3 and dopamine D-2 receptors. In this study, by using reserpinized mice, we demonstrate the existence of behaviorally significant antagonistic postsynaptic interactions between H-3 and D-1 and also between H-3 and dopamine D-2 receptors. The selective H-3 receptor agonist imetit inhibited, while the H-3 receptor antagonist thioperamide potentiated locomotor activation induced by either the D-1 receptor agonist SKF 38393 or the D-2 receptor agonist quinpirole. High scores of locomotor activity were obtained with H-3 receptor blockade plus D-1 and D-2 receptor co-activation, i.e., when thioperamide was co-administered with both SKF 38393 and quinpirole. Radioligand binding experiments in striatal membrane preparations showed the existence of a strong and selective H-3-D-2 receptor interaction at the membrane level. In agonist/antagonist competition experiments, stimulation of H-3 receptors with several H-3 receptor agonists significantly decreased the affinity of D-2 receptors for the agonist. This kind of intramembrane receptor-receptor interactions are a common biochemical property of receptor heteromers. In fact, by using Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer techniques in co-transfected HEK-293 cells, H-3 (but not H-4) receptors were found to form heteromers with D-2 receptors.

Structure-activity relationships of pentacycloundecylamines at the <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						NMDA receptor antagonists; NGP1-01; neuroprotection; excitotoxicity Ca-45 uptake; synaptoneurosomes; memantine; nitrendipine; dual-mechanism drugs	MULTIFUNCTIONAL NEUROPROTECTIVE DRUGS; BINDING-SITE; CALCIUM-CHANNELS; HIGH-AFFINITY; IN-VIVO; ANTAGONISTS; MK-801; BRAIN; MEMANTINE; NEUROTOXICITY	Prompted by our interest in neuroprotective agents with multiple mechanisms of action, we assessed the structure-activity relationship of a series of pentacycloundecylamine derivatives previously shown to have both L-type calcium channel blocking activity and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonistic activity. We utilized a functional assay to measure NMDAR channel block using Ca-45(2+) influx into synaptoneurosomes. The cage amine 8-benzylamino-8,11-oxapentacyclo[5.4.0.0(2,6). 0(3,10). 0(5,9)]undecane (NPG1-01) proved to be the most potent experimental compound with an IC50 of 2.98 mu M, while 8-amino-pentacyclo[5.4. 0.0(2.6). 0(3,10). 0(5,9)]undecane had the next most potent IC50 of 4.06 mu M. Increasing the polycyclic cage size of NGP1-01 from a pentacycloundecane to a tridecane cage structure, but retaining the N-benzyl moiety decreased potency 10-fold, indicating a limitation on the volume of the cage that can be accommodated in the channel binding site. In the presence of NGP1-01, NMDA/glycine-induced maximal Ca-45(2+) influx was attenuated by 34% with an insignificant effect on agonist potency. These results are consistent with uncompetitive antagonism for this group of compounds. Radioligand binding studies with [H-3]MK-801 or [H-3]TCP showed little or no displacement of these ligands by pentacycloundecylamines, suggesting that the latter compounds bind to a unique site in the NMDAR channel. The pentacycloundecylamines tested represent a novel group of NMDAR antagonists that have potential as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease.

This hypothesis was tested using the putative selective 5-HT2C receptor agonist, WAY 161503. Experimental approach: The effect of WAY 161503 on 5-HT cell firing in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) was investigated in anaesthetised rats using single unit extracellular recordings. The effect of WAY 161503 on DRN GABA neurones was investigated using double label immunohistochemical measurements of Fos, glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and 5-HT2C receptors. Finally, drug occupancy at 5-HT2A receptors was investigated using rat positron emission tomography and ex vivo binding studies with the 5-HT2A receptor radioligand [C-11]MDL 100907. Key results: WAY 161503 caused a dose-related inhibition of 5-HT cell firing which was reversed by the 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin and the 5-HT2C receptor antagonist SB 242084 but not by the 5-HT1A receptor antagonist WAY 100635. SB 242084 pretreatment also prevented the response to WAY 161503. The blocking effects of SB 242084 likely involved 5-HT2C receptors because the drug did not demonstrate 5-HT2A receptor occupancy in vivo or ex vivo. The inhibition of 5-HT cell firing induced by WAY 161503 was partially reversed by the GABA(A) receptor antagonist picrotoxin. Also, WAY 161503 increased Fos expression in GAD positive DRN neurones and DRN GAD positive neurones expressed 5-HT2C receptor immunoreactivity. Conclusions and implications: These findings indicate that WAY 161503 inhibits 5-HT cell firing in the DRN in vivo, and support a mechanism involving 5-HT2C receptor-mediated activation of DRN GABA neurones.

Alkylation of opioid receptors by 5′-naltrindole-isothiocyanate injected into the nucleus accumbens of rats:: Receptor selectivity and anatomical diffusion	SYNAPSE			English	Article						opioid; antagonist; delta receptors; mu receptors; central nervous system; brain; irreversible; limbic system	BETA-FUNALTREXAMINE; NALTRINDOLE 5-ISOTHIOCYANATE; MEDIATED ANTINOCICEPTION; DIFFERENTIAL ANTAGONISM; DELTA-ANTINOCICEPTION; RELATIVE EFFICACY; MU; MOUSE; SUBTYPES; AGONIST	Subtypes of the delta opioid receptor (Oprd1) have been suggested based on pharmacology studies. However, these subtypes have not been confirmed biochemically using either receptor binding assays or molecular cloning. Naltrindole-5'-isothiocyanate (5'-NTII) is an irreversible opioid antagonist that appears to selectively inhibit the actions of a subset of delta opioid agonists in vivo, referred to as putative delta-2 agonists. The biochemical and anatomical selectivity of wash-resistant inhibition of binding of [H-3]DAMGO (Oprm1), [H-3]DPDPE (Oprd1, putative subtype 1 agonist), or [H-3]deltorphin II (Oprd1, putative subytpe 2 agonist) in coronal sections was assessed using quantitative in vitro autoradiography following injection of 5'-NTII into the nucleus accumbens in rats. 5'-NTII decreased [H-3]deltorphin II to a greater extent than the binding of the other two radioligands following administration of 0.05-2.5 nmol. The effects of 5'-NTII were largely confined to the nucleus accumbens; however, some loss in the ventral caudate was also noted. In contrast, administration of the nonselective opioid receptor alkylating antagonist beta-chlornaltexamine (beta-CNA) over a similar range of doses was found to be nonselective for either 6 radioligand, and produced greater inhibition of Oprm1 relative to Oprd1 binding, consistent with the nonselective pharmacological activity of this antagonist. Although 5'-NTII inhibited [H-3]deltorphin II binding to a greater extent, the binding of the other two radioligands was decreased over a similar range of doses. Absolute conclusions regarding the involvement of delta-2 opioid receptors in pharmacological or physiological effects based on studies with 5'-NTII should therefore be tempered, and for site-directed studies it would be best to employ doses of 0.5 nmol or lower.

The objective of this investigation was to study the dynamics of the entire inhibition process of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), using positron emission tomography (PET). The P-gp marker [C-11]verapamil was administered to anesthetized rats as an i.v. bolus dose followed by graded infusions via a computerized pump system to obtain a steady-state concentration of [C-11]verapamil in brain. The P-gp modulator cyclosporin A (CsA) (3, 10 and 25 mg/kg) was administered as a short bolus injection 30 min after the start of the [C-11]verapamil infusion. The CsA pharmacokinetics was studied in whole blood in a parallel group of rats. The CsA blood concentrations were used as input to model P-gp inhibition. The inhibition of P-gp was observed as a rapid increase in brain concentrations of [C-11]verapamil, with a maximum after 5, 7.5 and 17.5 min for the respective doses. The respective increases in maximal [C-11]verapamil concentrations were 1.5, 2.5 and 4 times the baseline concentration. A model in which CsA inhibited P-gp by decreasing the transport of [C-11]verapamil out from the brain resulted in the best fit. Our data suggest that it is not the CsA concentration in blood, but rather the CsA concentration in an effect compartment, probably the endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier that is responsible for the inhibition of P-gp.

Our studies in intact animals suggest that this effect on the cardiac sympathetic nerve endings is caused by oxidative stress and/or NE toxic metabolites derived from NE. In this study, we investigated the direct effects of NE on neuronal NE uptake activity and NE transporter (NET), using undifferentiated PC12 cells. Cells were incubated with NE (1-500 muM) either alone or in combination of Cu2+ sulfate (1 muM), which promotes free radical formation by Fenton reaction for 24 h. NE uptake activity was measured using [H-3]NE. Cell viability was determined with the use of Trypan blue exclusion and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay, and cellular oxidative stress by dichlorodihydrofluorescein fluorescence and the GSH/GSSG ratio. Cell viability was reduced by NE > 100 muM. At lower doses, NE produced oxidative stress and a dose-dependent reduction of NE uptake activity without affecting cell viability significantly. Cu2+, which has no direct effect on NE uptake activity, potentiated oxidative stress and reduction of NE uptake activity produced by NE. This decrease of NE uptake activity was associated with reductions of NE uptake binding sites and NET protein expression by using the radioligand assay and Western blot analysis, but no changes in NET gene expression. In addition, the free-radical scavenger mannitol, and antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase, reduced oxidative stress and attenuated the reductions of NE uptake activity and NET protein produced by NE/Cu. Thus our results support a functional role of oxidative stress in mediating the neuronal NE uptake reducing effect of NE and that this effect of NE on NET is a posttranscriptional event.

Previous studies in our laboratory indicate that oxidative stress induces expression of the A(1) adenosine receptor (A(1)AR) via activation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. In this study, we tested whether noise exposure could induce oxidative stress and determine whether this induces expression of the A(1)AR in the chinchilla cochlea. Chinchillas were exposed to a 96 dB 4 kHz octave band of noise for 6 h of daily exposure, followed by an 18 h noise-free period. This noise paradigm resulted in threshold shifts of 10-60 dB over the frequency range (1-16 kHz) tested. Radioligand binding studies for the A(1)AR indicate a significant increase in receptor (similar to2-fold) expression soon after the first noise exposure period (usually within similar to8 h of the initiation of noise), which gradually returned to basal levels by day 7. The rise in A(1)AR levels was followed by a significant increase in malondialdehyde levels by day 3, which also recovered by day 7. Assessment of the activity of NADPH oxidase in the cochlea indicates a significant increase in enzyme activity which was evident by similar to8 h following initiation of noise exposure, and which persisted for at least up to day 3. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicate that the increase in A(1)AR was associated with a significant increase in NF-kappaB activity following noise exposure. We conclude that noise exposure induces A(1)AR expression, which might be mediated, in part, through generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of NF-kappaB. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Radioligand binding studies measuring displacement of [H-3]PGF(2alpha) by a variety of FP prostaglandin analogs yielded the following rank order of affinities: travoprost acid [(+)-16-m-trifluorophenoxy tetranor PGF(2alpha);(+)-fluprostenol] > bimatoprost acid (17-phenyl-trinor PGF(2alpha)) >> unoprostone (13,14-dihydro-15-keto-20-ethyl PGF(2alpha)) = bimatoprost (17-phenyl-trinor PGF(2alpha) ethyl amide) greater than or equal to Lumigan (bimatoprost ophthalmic solution). In FP functional studies, travoprost acid (EC50 = 17.5-37 nM, n = 13), bimatoprost acid (EC50 = 23.3-49.0 nM, n = 6-12), unoprostone (EC50 = 306-1270 nM, n = 4-8), bimatoprost (EC50 = 3070-3940 nM, n = 4-9), and Lumigan (EC50 = 1470-3190 nM, n = 5-9) concentration dependently stimulated [Ca2+](i) mobilization via the rat (A7r5 cells), mouse (3T3 cells), and cloned human ocular FP prostanoid receptors. The rank order of potency of these compounds at the FP receptor of the three species was similar and in good agreement with the determined binding affinities. The agonist effects of these compounds were concentration dependently blocked by the FP receptor-selective antagonist, AL-8810 (11beta-fluoro-15-epi-15-indanyl-tetranor PGF(2alpha))( K-i = 0.6-1.3 muM). These studies have demonstrated that bimatoprost, unoprostone, and bimatoprost acid possess direct agonist activities at the rat, mouse, and human FP prostanoid receptor and that travoprost acid is the most potent of the synthetic FP prostaglandin analogs tested.

M., Mitterdorfer, J., Kaczorowski, G. J., Garcia, M. L., and Knaus, H. G. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 2639-2644). In this report, we determine the three-dimensional structure of HgTX1 using NMR spectroscopy (PDB-code: 1HLY). HgTX1 was found to possess a structure similar to previously characterized K+ channel toxins (e.g. margatoxin) consisting of a three-stranded antiparallel 3-sheet (residues 2-4, 26-30, and 33-37) and a helical conformation (part 310 helix and part a helix; residues 10-20). Due to the importance of residue Lys-28 for high-affinity interaction with the respective channels, lysine-reactive fluorescence dyes cannot be used to label wild-type HgTX,. On the basis of previous studies (see above) and our NMR data, a HgTX1 mutant (HgTX1-A19C) was engineered, expressed, and purified. HgTX1-A19C-SH was labeled using sulfhydryl-reactive Cy3-, Cy5-, and Alexa-dyes. Pharmacological characterization of fluorescently labeled HgTX1-A19C in radioligand binding studies indicated that these hongotoxin, analogues retain high-affinity for voltage-gated K+ channels and a respective pharmacological profile. Cy3- and Alexa-dye-labeled hongotoxin, analogues were used to investigate the localization of K+ channels in brain sections. The distribution of toxin binding closely follows the distribution of K(v)1.2 inummoreactivity with the highest expression levels in the cerebellar Purkinje cell layer. Taken together, these results demonstrate that fluorescently labeled HgTX1 analogues comprise novel probes to characterize a subset of voltage-gated K+ channels.

J	Liu, L; Murray, M; Burcher, E				Liu, L; Murray, M; Burcher, E			Structure-activity studies of bufokinin, substance P and their C-terminal fragments at bufokinin receptors in the small intestine of the cane toad, <i>Bufo marinus</i>	BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						structure-activity; substance P; tachykinin receptors; amphibian; intestine; QSAR	TACHYKININ RECEPTORS; NEUROKININ RECEPTORS; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; LOCALIZATION; SELECTIVITY; PEPTIDE; GUT	Bufokinin is a substance P-related tachykinin peptide with potent spasmogenic actions, isolated from the intestine of the cane toad, Bufo marinus. Bufokinin acts via a tachykinin receptor with similarities to the mammalian NK1 receptor. In this structure-activity study of bufokinin, substance P (SP) and their C-terminal fragments, we have used isolated segments and homogenates of toad small intestine to compare the contractile potencies and abilities to compete for the binding of [I-125]-Bolton-Hunter bufokinin. In general, potency was very similar in both studies (r = 0.956) and was primarily related to peptide length, with the natural undecapeptide tachykinins bufakinin approximate to ranakinin > SP approximate to cod SP approximate to trout SP being most potent. The weakest peptides were [Pro(9)]SP, BUF(7-11) and SP(7-11). Bufokinin fragments (BUF) were approximately equipotent to the corresponding SP fragments, with only BUF(5-11) showing unexpectedly low binding affinity. Data obtained with SP, bufokinin and fragments were subjected to quantitative structure-activity (QSAR) analysis which demonstrated that molecular connectivity and shape descriptors yielded significant regression equations (r approximate to 0.90). The predictive capacity of the equations was confirmed using ranakinin, trout SP and cod SP, but not using the synthetic analogs [Pro(9)]SP and [Sar(9)]SP. The study suggests that the fall undecapeptide sequence of bufokinin is required for optimal activity, with high potency conferred by Lys(1), Pro(2), Gly(9) and probably Tyr(8). The finding that receptor-ligand interactions were correlated with the shape descriptor (2)kappa(alpha) and favored by basic and rigid residues at position 1-3 is consistent with an important role of conformation at the N-terminus of bufokinin.

Because of its superior imaging properties, there is growing interest in the use of positron emission tomography (PET) technology for SMS scintigraphy. This study addressed the production of gallium-68 DOTA-TOC, its biokinetics and its clinical performance in detecting SMS-positive tumours and metastases. A preparation protocol was developed, yielding 40% overall incorporation of Ga-68 into the peptide (DOTATOC). After column filtration, the radiochemical purity exceeded 98%. Eight patients with histologically verified carcinoid tumours were injected with 80-250 MBq of this tracer. PET acquisition was initiated immediately after administration and carried out until 3 h post injection. Images were quantitated using standardised uptake values and target to non-target ratios. Prior to Ga-68-DOTATOC PET, all patients underwent indium-111 octreotide planar and single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) imaging. Arterial activity elimination was bi-exponential, with half-lives of 2.0 (+/-0.3) min and 48 (+/-7) min. No radioactive metabolites were detected within 4 h in serum. Maximal tumour activity accumulation was reached 70+/-20 min post injection. Kidney uptake averaged <50% compared with spleen uptake. Of 40 lesions predefined by computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging, Ga-68-DOTATOC PET identified 100%, whereas In-111-octreotide planar and SPET imaging identified only 85%. Tumour to non-tumour ratios ranged from >3:1 for liver (In-111-octreotide: 1.5: 1) to 100: 1 for CNS (In-111-octreotide: 10:1). With Ga-68-DOTATOC >30% additional lesions were detected. It is concluded that PET using Ga-68-DOTATOC results in high tumour to non-tumour contrast and low kidney accumulation and yields higher detection rates as compared with In-111-octreotide scintigraphy.

J	Hemmings, SJ; Spafford, D				Hemmings, SJ; Spafford, D			Neonatal STZ model of type II diabetes mellitus in the Fischer 344 rat: characteristics and assessment of the status of the hepatic adrenergic receptors	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOCHEMISTRY & CELL BIOLOGY			English	Article						neonatal rat; streptozotocin; hepatic adrenergic receptors; glucocounterregulation	GAMMA-GLUTAMYL-TRANSPEPTIDASE; BETA-CELL MASS; B-CELL; INSULIN-RESISTANCE; GLUCOSE COUNTERREGULATION; PLASMA-MEMBRANES; STREPTOZOTOCIN; LIVER; HYPERGLYCEMIA; SECRETION	The Fischer 344 rat was found to be extremely sensitive to the diabetogenic effects of neonatally injected streptozotocin (STZ): injection of 40-100 mg/kg STZ at 1.5 days postnatal produced in the adult graded levels of hyperglycemia in males but not the females. The optimal dose in the 1.5 day old male was 80 mg/kg: it produced hyperglycemia without affecting growth or thyroid status in the adult. The neonatally STZ-injected adult rat displayed characteristics consistent with type II diabetes: mild hyperglycemia accentuated by fasting or consumption of a high fat diet; little change in insulin levels; slight elevation in glucagon levels; no alterations in ketones. Using radioligand binding techniques to isolated rat liver plasma membranes, compared to the control state, the type II diabetic state was found to have: no effect on either alpha(2)- or beta-adrenergic receptor binding; a decrease in the major dominant alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor, reflecting a decrease in receptor numbers but not their affinity; an increase in the plasma membrane calcium transport system, potentially depleting intracellular calcium stores essential for producing an alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor response. Since the alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor-calcium effector system is critical for the actions of catecholamines in the rat, these results suggest that the liver in the type II diabetic state may be refractory to the actions of catecholamines. We propose that the diabetes-evoked decrease in the dominant adrenergic receptor-effector system through which catecholamines act may be the cellular expression of defective glucocounrerregulation in the diabetic stale.

Correlation of functional and radioligand binding characteristics of GPER ligands confirming aldosterone as a GPER agonist	PHARMACOLOGY RESEARCH & PERSPECTIVES			English	Article						aldosterone; GPCR; GPER; mineralocorticoid	COUPLED ESTROGEN RECEPTOR-1; BETA-ADRENERGIC-RECEPTORS; BREAST-CANCER; SF9 CELLS; PROTEIN; PROLIFERATION; EXPRESSION; PURIFICATION; ACTIVATION; GPR30	Aldosterone exerts some of its effects not by binding to mineralocorticoid receptors, but rather by acting via G protein-coupled estrogen receptors (GPER). To determine if aldosterone binds directly to GPER, we studied the ability of aldosterone to compete for the binding of [H-3] 2-methoxyestradiol ([H-3] 2-ME), a high potency GPER-selective agonist. We used GPER gene transfer to engineer Sf9-cultured insect cells to express GPER. We chose insect cells to avoid interactions with any intrinsic mammalian receptors for aldosterone. [H-3] 2-ME binding was saturable and reversible to a high-affinity population of receptors with K-d =3.7 nM and B-max =2.2 pmol/mg. Consistent with agonist binding to G Protein-coupled receptors, [H-3] 2-ME high-affinity state binding was reduced in the presence of the hydrolysis-resistant GTP analog, GppNHp. [H-3] 2-ME binding was competed for by the GPER agonist G1, the GPER antagonist G15, estradiol (E2), as well as aldosterone (Aldo). The order of potency for competing for [H-3] 2-ME binding, namely 2ME > Aldo > E2 >= G1, paralleled the orders of potency for inhibition of cell proliferation and inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by ligands acting at GPER. These data confirm the ability of aldosterone to interact with the GPER, consistent with the interpretation that aldosterone likely mediates its GPER-dependent effects by direct binding to the GPER. Significance statement: Despite the growing evidence for aldosterone's actions via G protein-coupled estrogen receptors (GPER), there remains significant skepticism that aldosterone can directly interact with GPER. The current studies are the first demonstrate directly that aldosterone indeed is capable of binding to the GPER and thus likely mediates its GPER-dependent effects by direct binding to the receptor.

Prostate-specific membrane antigen-targeted radionuclide therapy is a potential treatment for these patients. Here, we report our initial experience in Singapore. Methods Twenty men (median age 70) with progressive disease were prospectively recruited. Prostate-specific membrane antigen and fluorodeoxyglucose-PET/computed tomography were performed to confirm high prostate-specific membrane antigen-expression. Up to four cycles of(177)lutetium-prostate-specific membrane antigen-I&T at 6-8 weekly intervals were administered. Patients were restaged 3 months following treatment. Primary endpoints were prostate-specific antigen decline >= 50% and treatment-related toxicity. Additional endpoints included radiological and clinical response as well as progression-free survival and overall survival from first cycle. Results Sixty-seven cycles were administered (median 4 cycles per patient, mean 6.5 GBq per cycle). Sixty five percent had >= 1 line of prior chemotherapy, 90% abiraterone, enzalutamide or both, and 30% radium-223 radionuclide therapy. All had bone metastases and 35% had visceral metastases. Prostate-specific antigen decline >= 50% was achieved in 50%. Grade 3-4 hematotoxicity was seen in up to 15%. Grade 3-4 non-hematotoxicity was not observed. Eleven patients had restaging scans 3 months post-treatment (5 = partial response, 6 = progressive disease). Fifty-seven percent (4/7) with bone pain had pain improvement. Median progression-free survival was 5.9 months and median overall survival 13.1 months. Patients with prostate-specific antigen decline >= 50% had longer progression-free survival and overall survival. Conclusion (177)Lutetium-prostate-specific membrane antigen-I&T therapy is effective with tolerable side effects in our local setting. Prostate-specific antigen decline >= 50% is associated with longer progression-free survival and overall survival.

Oxytocin Receptor Binding Sites in the Periphery of the Neonatal Prairie Vole	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						oxytocin receptor (OXTR); prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster); neonate; autoradiography; oxytocin	MATERNAL-CARE; PARENTAL BEHAVIOR; DEFICIENT MICE; C-FOS; VASOPRESSIN; EXPRESSION; FEMALE; INFANT; RESPONSES; STRESS	The oxytocin receptor (OXTR) has been observed in the periphery of neonatal C57BL/6J mice (Mus musculus), including facial regions and the anogenital area. In those studies, ligand specificity was confirmed with a congenital OXTR knockout mouse as well as competitive binding techniques. The aim of this study was to determine if OXTR is present in the same peripheral sites in the neonatal prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) for cross-species comparisons. Receptor autoradiography was performed on 20 mu m m sagittal sections of whole postnatal day 0 (P0) male and female prairie voles using the (125)iodinated-ornithine vasotocin ([I-125]-OVTA) radioligand. A competition binding assay was used to assess the selectivity of [I-125]-OVTA for peripheral OXTR. Radioactive ligand (0.05 nM [I-125]-OVTA) was competed against concentrations of 0 and 1000 nM excess unlabeled oxytocin (OXT). Previously identified regions of significant OXTR ligand binding in the mouse were analyzed for comparison: rostral and lateral periodontium, olfactory epithelium, ciliary bodies of the eye, whisker pads, adrenal gland, and anogenital area. We also evaluated the liver and scapular brown adipose tissue, which displayed strong but non-specific signal on film in mice. While there were some areas that showed conserved OXTR ligand binding in the prairie vole (e.g., ciliary body of the eye and the anogenital area), areas showing OXTR ligand binding in the neonatal prairie vole were not identical to OXTR ligand binding in the periphery of the C57BL/6J neonatal mouse. Further, some of the regions measured in the prairie vole suggest sex differences in OXTR ligand binding. Collectively, as is well-established in the central nervous system, these data indicate that patterns of OXTR ligand binding in the infant periphery are species-specific.

Novel prodrug PRX-P4-003, selectively activated by gut enzymes, may reduce the risk of iatrogenic addiction and abuse	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Addiction; Prodrug; Stimulant; Intravenous abuse; ADHD; Binge eating disorder	LISDEXAMFETAMINE DIMESYLATE; PANCREATIC LIPASE; N-DEMETHYLATION; DRINKING-WATER; METHYLPHENIDATE; FORMALDEHYDE; DOPAMINE; FENCAMFAMINE; DISORDER; COCAINE	Objectives: Prescription stimulants are vulnerable to oral and parenteral abuse. Intravenous forms of abuse may be most detrimental due to an enhanced risk of dependence, overdose, and infectious diseases. Our objective was to discover an orally active prodrug of a stimulant that would not be easily converted to its parent when injected, thus hindering intravenous abuse. Methods: Following an initial analysis of stimulant structures, the fencamfamine isomer [(-)-FCF; (N-ethy1-3phenylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-amine)] was chosen as a parent drug due to its favorable biochemical properties. Subsequently, PRX-P4-003 {(-)-N-(Octadecanoyloxymethoxycarbony1)-N-ethyl-3-phenylbicyclo [2.2.1] heptan-2amine} qualified for further development. Experimental testing of PRX-P4-003 included radioligand binding assays, stability studies, and rodent pharmacokinetic and locomotor assays. Results: Prodrug PRX-P4-003 is a pharmacologically inactive, hydrophobic compound, whereas its parent (-)-FCF is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with weaker effects on norepinephrine reuptake (K, = 0.07 and 0.80 M, respectively). PRX-P4-003 is metabolized to (-)-FCF in simulated intestinal fluid (with pancreatin) but not in simulated gastric fluid (with pepsin). Finally, PRX-P4-003 shows a significant oral but no intravenous increase in locomotion, correlating with its pharmacokinetics by these different routes of administration. Conclusions: PRX-P4-003 is a novel prodrug stimulant enzymatically activated in the gut. Our data suggest a pancreatic, lipase -based mechanism of activation and as only 1% of this enzyme is found in the systemic circulation, PRX-P4-003 is unlikely to be bioactive if injected intravenously. Enzymatic release of (-)-FCF is needed prior to its systemic absorption, which may discourage oral abuse (e.g., by chewing). PRX-P4-003 is being developed for apathy in Alzheimer's disease and binge eating disorder.

With respect to the effects of alcohol on extrastriatal D-2/D-3 dopamine receptors no investigations have been reported yet. Therefore we applied PET imaging using the postsynaptic dopamine D-2/D-3 receptor ligand [F-18] fallypride addressing the question, whether intravenously applied alcohol stimulates the extrastriatal and striatal dopamine system. We measured subjective effects of alcohol and made correlation analyses with the striatal and extrastriatal D-2/D-3 binding potential. Twenty-four healthy male mu-opioid receptor (OPRM1) 118G allele carriers underwent a standardized intravenous and placebo alcohol administration. The subjective effects of alcohol were measured with a visual analogue scale. For the evaluation of the dopamine response we calculated the binding potential (BPND) by using the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM). In addition, we calculated distribution volumes (target and reference regions) in 10 subjects for which metabolite corrected arterial samples were available. In the alcohol condition no significant dopamine response in terms of a reduction of BPND was observed in striatal and extrastriatal brain regions. We found a positive correlation for 'liking' alcohol and the BPND in extrastriatal brain regions (Inferior frontal cortex (IFC) (r = 0.533, p= 0.007), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (r = 0.416, p = 0.043) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) (r = 0.625, p= 0.001)). The acute alcohol effects on the D2/D3 dopamine receptor binding potential of the striatal and extrastriatal system in our experiment were insignificant. A positive correlation of the subjective effect of 'liking' alcohol with cortical D2/D3 receptors may hint at an addiction relevant trait.

However, the exact mechanisms of action remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the binding distribution and levels of the serotonin 1B receptor in-depth in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and provide more insight in its functional role in bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia (SZ). Serotonin 1B receptor binding distribution was visualized with high resolution autoradiography (ARG), using the radioligand [H-3]AZ10419369, in postmortem ACC tissue from patients diagnosed with BD (n=14), MDD (n=12), SZ (n=13) and healthy subjects (n=13). Moreover, a quantification of receptor binding was made with ARG, in relation to patient group, age and gender. In all subject groups a significantly higher specific binding of serotonin 1B receptor was measured in the outer ACC layers compared to the inner ACC layers. Correlation analysis with ARG binding patterns of several radioligands resulted in a significant correlation with glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor binding in the outer layers. No significant difference was found between subject groups in binding levels and distribution. In female subjects a significantly lower receptor binding was found than in male subjects, which was most profound in patients diagnosed with MDD. The binding distribution of the serotonin 1B receptor found in this study supports a role in glutamate transmission in the ACC and was not shown to be significantly altered in BD, MDD or SZ. A gender difference in serotonin 1B receptor binding was found. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP. All rights reserved.

Considering its modulating effect on neurotransmission, we hypothesized that cerebral mGluR5 availability is associated with temperament traits in healthy humans. Methods: Forty-four nonsmoking healthy volunteers (mean age +/- SD, 40 +/- 14 y; age range, 22-66 y; 22 women) were included in this cross-sectional investigation. Brain mGluR5 availability was quantified on both a voxel-by-voxel and a volume-of-interest basis using the total distribution volume of the radioligand F-18-3-fluoro-5-[(pyridin-3-yl)ethynyl]benzonitrile (F-18-FPEB) with 90-min dynamic PET and arterial input function. Moreover, glutamate-glutamine concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex were measured using MR spectroscopy. These measures were related to the temperament traits of the 240-item Cloninger temperament and character inventory using a regression analysis with age and sex as nuisance variables. Results: High novelty-seeking temperament was robustly associated with increased mGluR5 availability in various regions including the thalamus (r = 0.71; the strongest association), amygdala, parahippocampus, insula, anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, and several primary sensory areas (all r > 0.58; P < 0.05, corrected for familywise error). These associations were specific because no correlations were found with other temperament scales or with spectroscopic measures of glutamatergic transmission. Conclusion: Overall, these data posit mGluR5 in key paralimbic areas as a strong determinant of the temperament trait novelty seeking. These data add to our understanding of how brain neurochemistry accounts for the variation in human behavior and strongly support further research on mGluR5 as a potential therapeutic target in neuropsychiatric disorders associated with abnormal novelty-seeking behaviors.

Methods: A panel of radioligand-receptor binding assays was performed to identify the affinities of Y-QA31 for different G protein-coupled receptors. [S-35]GTP gamma S-binding assays and Ca2+ imaging were used to assess its intrinsic activities. The antipsychotic profile of Y-QA31 was characterized in mouse models for the positive symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia and extrapyramidal side effects with haloperidol and clozapine as positive controls. Results: In vitro, Y-QA31 is a dopamine D-3 receptor antagonist that is 186-fold more potent at the D-3 receptor than at the D-2 receptor. Y-QA31 also exhibits 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist and alpha(1A) adrenoceptor antagonist activities with medium affinity, whereas it exhibits very little affinity for other receptors (100-fold lower than for the D-3 receptor). In vivo, Y-QA31 (10-40 mg/kg, po) significantly inhibited MK-801-induced hyperlocomotion and methamphetamine-induced prepulse inhibition disruption in a dose-dependent manner. Y-QA31 also inhibited the avoidance response and methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion with potency lower than haloperidol. Y-QA31 was effective in alleviating the MK-801-induced disruption of novel object recognition at a low dose (1 mg/kg, po). Moreover, Y-QA31 itself did not affect spontaneous locomotion or induce cataleptic response until its dose reached 120 mg/kg. Conclusion: Y-QA31 is a selective D3R antagonist that exhibits antipsychotic effects in some animal models with positive symptoms and cognitive disorder and less extrapyramidal side effects.

Potent inactivation of [H-3]MK-801 binding to NMDA receptors (NRs) was provided by the cation cetyl pyridinium (IC50 25 mu M) and the neutral digitonin (IC(50)37 mu M). A 2 h incubation of rat brain membranes at 24 degrees C with 100 mu M of the neutral Triton X-100 resulted in about 50% reversible inhibition (without inactivation). Reversible inhibition was also effected by the anion deoxycholate (IC50 700 mu M), and by the zwit-terions N-lauryl sulfobetaine (12-SB +/-, 400 mu M) and CHAPS (1.5 mM), with inactivation at higher concentrations. Keeping the NR cation channel in the closed state significantly protected against inactivation by cations and by 12-SB +/-, but not by the other detergents. Inactivation depended differentially on the amount of the membranes, on the duration of the treatment, and on the temperature. Varying the amount of membranes by a factor 8 yielded for cetyl trimethylammonium (16-NMe3+) IC(50)s of inactivation from 10 to 80 mu M, while for deoxycholate the IC50 of inactivation was 1.2 mM for all tissue quantities. Some compounds inactivated within a few min (16-NMe3+, digitonin, CHAPS), while inactivation by others took at least half an hour (Triton X-100, deoxycholate, 12-SB +/-). These last 3 ones also exhibited the steepest temperature dependence. Knowledge about the influence of various parameters is helpful in selecting appropriate conditions allowing the treatment of brain membranes with amphiphiles without risking irreversible inactivation.

MDMA abusers are often accompanied by long-term serotonergic neurotoxicity, which is associated with reduced density of cerebral serotonin transporters (SERT) and depressive disorders. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenolic phytoalexin that has been known for its antidepressant and neuroprotective effects. However, biological targets of RSV as well as its neuroprotective effects against MDMA remained largely unknown. In this study, we examined binding potency of RSV and MDMA to SERT using small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) with the SERT radioligand, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-[F-18]fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[F-18]-ADAM) and investigated the protection of RSV against the acute and long-term adverse effects of MDMA. We found that RSV exhibit binding potentials to SERT in vivo in a dose-dependent manner with variation among brain regions. When the MDMA-treated rats (10 mg/kg, s.c.) were co-injected with RSV (20 mg/kg, i.p.) twice daily for 4 consecutive days, MDMA-induced acute elevation in plasma corticosterone was significantly reduced. Further, 4-[F-18]-ADAM PET imaging revealed that RSV protected against the MDMA-induced decrease in SERT availability in the midbrain and the thalamus 2 weeks following the co-treatment. The PET data were comparable to the observation from the forced swim test that RSV sufficiently ameliorated the depressive-like behaviors of the MDMA-treated rats. Together, these findings suggest that RSV is a potential antidepressant and may confer protection against neurobiological and behavioral changes induced by MDMA. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

Hallucinogen-like effects of 2-([2-(4-cyano-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl) ethylamino]methyl)phenol (25CN-NBOH), a novel <i>N</i>-benzylphenethylamine with 100-fold selectivity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors, in mice	PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Serotonin receptor; Drug abuse; Drug discrimination; Mouse	HEAD-TWITCH RESPONSE; AGONIST RADIOLIGAND; DERIVATIVES; BINDING	2-([2-(4-cyano-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethylamino]methyl)phenol (25CN-NBOH) is structurally similar to N-benzyl substituted phenethylamine hallucinogens currently emerging as drugs of abuse. 25CN-NBOH exhibits dramatic selectivity for 5-HT2A receptors in vitro, but has not been behaviorally characterized. 25CN-NBOH was compared to the traditional phenethylamine hallucinogen R(-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) using mouse models of drug-elicited head twitch behavior and drug discrimination. Drug-elicited head twitches were quantified for 10 min following administration of various doses of either DOI or 25CN-NBOH, with and without pretreatments of 0.01 mg/kg 5-HT2A antagonist M100907 or 3.0 mg/kg 5-HT2C antagonist RS102221. The capacity of 25CN-NBOH to attenuate DOI-elicited head twitch was also investigated. Mice were trained to discriminate DOI or M100907 from saline, and 25CN-NBOH was tested for generalization. 25CN-NBOH induced a head twitch response in the mouse that was lower in magnitude than that of DOI, blocked by M100907, but not altered by RS102221. DOI-elicited head twitch was dose-dependently attenuated by 25CN-NBOH pretreatment. 25CN-NBOH produced an intermediate degree of generalization (55 %) for the DOI training dose, and these interoceptive effects were attenuated by M100907. Finally, 25CN-NBOH did not generalize to M100907 at any dose, but ketanserin fully substituted in these animals. 25CN-NBOH was behaviorally active, but less effective than DOI in two mouse models of hallucinogenic effects. The effectiveness with which M100907 antagonized the behavioral actions of 25CN-NBOH strongly suggests that the 5-HT2A receptor is an important site of agonist action for this compound in vivo.

J	Seo, MS; Scarr, E; Dean, B				Seo, Myoung Suk; Scarr, Elizabeth; Dean, Brian			An investigation of the factors that regulate muscarinic receptor expression in schizophrenia	SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizophrenia; Human; Cortex; Post-mortem; CHRM1; SP1	TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR SP1; HUMAN BRAIN; GENE; BINDING; PHOSPHORYLATION; SELECTIVITY; DENSITY; MEMORY	We previously identified a group of subjects with schizophrenia who, on average, have a 75% decrease in cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 1 (CHRM1) in Brodmann's area (BA) 9. To extend this finding, we determined i) if the decrease in CHRM1 was present in another functionally related CNS region (BA6), ii) whether the marked decrease in CHRM1 was accompanied by changes in levels of other CHRMs and iii) potential factors responsible for the decreased CHRM1 expression. We measured CHRM1 and CHRM3 using in situ radioligand binding with [H-3] pirenzepine and [H-3]4-DAMP respectively in BA6 from 20 subjects with schizophrenia who had low levels of CHRM1 in BA9 (SzLow[H-3]PZP), 18 subjects with schizophrenia whose levels of CHRM1 were similar to controls (SzNormal[H-3]PZP) and 20 control subjects. Levels of CHRM1, 3 and 4 mRNA were measured using qPCR and levels of the transcription factors, SP1 and SP3, were determined using Western blots. In BA6, the density of [H-3] pirenzepine binding was decreased in subjects with SzLow[H-3] PZP (p < 0.001) compared to controls. The density of [H-3] 4-DAMP binding, levels of CHRM1, 3 and 4 mRNA and levels of SP1 and SP3 was not significantly different between the three groups. This study shows that the previously identified decrease in CHRM1 expression is not confined to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex but is present in other cortical areas. The effect shows some specificity to CHRM1, with no change in levels of binding to CHRM3. Furthermore, this decrease in CHRM1 does not appear to be associated with low levels of CHRM1 mRNA or to simply be regulated by the transcription factors, SP1 and SP3, suggesting that other mechanisms are responsible for the decreased CHRM1 in these subjects.

Design and pharmacological characterization of VUF14480, a covalent partial agonist that interacts with cysteine 98<SUP>3.36</SUP> of the human histamine H<sub>4</sub> receptor	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						covalent binder; histamine H-4 receptor; GPCR; pyrimidine	LIGAND-BINDING; IRREVERSIBLE INHIBITORS; MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; ANTAGONIST BINDING; PROTEIN; OPTIMIZATION; DISCOVERY; MODELS; POTENT	Background and Purpose The recently proposed binding mode of 2-aminopyrimidines to the human (h) histamine H-4 receptor suggests that the 2-amino group of these ligands interacts with glutamic acid residue E182(5.46) in the transmembrane (TM) helix 5 of this receptor. Interestingly, substituents at the 2-position of this pyrimidine are also in close proximity to the cysteine residue C98(3.36) in TM3. We hypothesized that an ethenyl group at this position will form a covalent bond with C98(3.36) by functioning as a Michael acceptor. A covalent pyrimidine analogue will not only prove this proposed binding mode, but will also provide a valuable tool for H-4 receptor research. Experimental Approach We designed and synthesized VUF14480, and pharmacologically characterized this compound in hH(4) receptor radioligand binding, G protein activation and -arrestin2 recruitment experiments. The ability of VUF14480 to act as a covalent binder was assessed both chemically and pharmacologically. Key Results VUF14480 was shown to be a partial agonist of hH(4) receptor-mediated G protein signalling and -arrestin2 recruitment. VUF14480 bound covalently to the hH(4) receptor with submicromolar affinity. Serine substitution of C98(3.36) prevented this covalent interaction. Conclusion and Implications VUF14480 is thought to bind covalently to the hH(4) receptor-C98(3.36) residue and partially induce hH(4) receptor-mediated G protein activation and -arrestin2 recruitment. Moreover, these observations confirm our previously proposed binding mode of 2-aminopyrimidines. VUF14480 will be a useful tool to stabilize the receptor into an active confirmation and further investigate the structure of the active hH(4) receptor.

Ligand-Specific Binding and Activation of the Human Adenosine A<sub>2B</sub> Receptor	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS; MOLECULAR-CLONING; G-PROTEIN; INTERNATIONAL UNION; EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; A(2A) RECEPTOR; A2B RECEPTOR; AGONIST; AFFINITY; RESIDUES	Adenosine A2B receptors, which play a role in inflammation and cancer, are of considerable interest as novel drug targets. To gain deeper insights into ligand binding and receptor activation, we exchanged amino acids predicted to be close to the binding pocket. The alanine mutants were stably expressed in CHO cells and characterized by radioligand binding and cAMP assays using three structural classes of ligands: xanthine (antagonist), adenosine, and aminopyridine derivatives (agonists). Asn282(7.45) and His280(7.43) were found to stabilize the binding site by intramolecular hydrogen bond formation as in the related A(2A) receptor subtype. Trp247(6.48), Val250(6.51), and particularly Ser279(7.42) were shown to be important for binding of nucleosidic agonists. Leu81(3.28), Asn186(5.42), and Val250(6.51) were discovered to be crucial for binding of the xanthine-derived antagonist PSB-603. Leu81(3.28), which is not conserved among adenosine receptor subtypes, may be important for the high selectivity of PSB-603. The N186(5.42)A mutant resulted in an increased potency for agonists. The interactions of the non-nucleosidic asonist BAY60-6583 were different from those of the nucleosides: while BAY60-6583 appeared not to interact with Ser279(7.42), its interactions with Trp247(6.48) and Val250(6.51) were significantly weaker compared to those of NECA. Moreover, our results discount the hypothesis of Trp247(6.48) serving as a "toogle switch" because BAY60-6583 was able to activate the corresponding mutant. This study reveals distinct interactions of structurally diverse ligands with the human A(2B) receptor and differences between closely related receptor subtypes (A(2B) and A(2A)). It will contribute to the understanding of G protein-coupled receptor function and advance A(2B) receptor ligand design.

The pan-selective sigma-receptor agonist N,N'-di-o-tolylguanidine (o-DTG) has been shown to reduce infarct volume in rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion, even when administered 24 hours after stroke. DTG derivatives were synthesized to develop novel compounds with greater potency than o-DTG. Fluorometric Ca2+ imaging was used in cultured cortical neurons to screen compounds for their capacity to reduce ischemia-and acidosis-evoked cytosolic Ca2+ overload, which has been linked to stroke-induced neurodegeneration. In both assays, migration of the methyl moiety produced no significant differences, but removal of the group increased potency of the compound for inhibiting acidosis-induced [Ca2+](i) elevations. Chloro and bromo substitution of the methyl moiety in the meta and para positions increased potency by <= 160%, but fluoro substitutions had no effect. The most potent DTG derivative tested was N, N'-di-p-bromo-phenyl-guanidine (rho-BrDPhG), which had an IC50 of 2.2 mu M in the ischemia assay, compared with 74.7 mu M for o-DTG. Microglial migration assays also showed that rho-BrDPhG is more potent than o-DTG in this marker for microglial activation, which is also linked to neuronal injury after stroke. Radioligand binding studies showed that rho-BrDPhG is a pan-selective sigma ligand. Experiments using the sigma-1 receptor-selective antagonist 1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine dihydrochloride (BD-1063) demonstrated that rho-BrDPhG blocks Ca2+ overload via sigma-1 receptor activation. The study identified four compounds that may be more effective than o-DTG for the treatment of ischemic stroke at delayed time points.

Since STW 5 was found to influence intestinal motility and has anti-inflammatory properties, this study investigated the expression of adenosine receptors and characterized their role in the control of the anti-inflammatory action of STW 5 and its fresh plant component STW 6 in inflammation-disturbed rat small intestinal preparations. The inflammation was induced by intraluminal instillation of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS, 0.01 M). The effects of coincubation with selective receptor agonists and antagonists, STW 5, STW 6, or combinations of these compounds on acetylcholine (ACh)-evoked contraction of ileum/jejunum preparations were tested. Adenosine receptor mRNA expression was examined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In untreated preparations, RT-PCR revealed the presence of all adenosine receptor subtypes. Suppressed expression was detected for all subtypes in inflamed tissues, except for A(2B)R mRNA, which was unaffected. STW 5 reversed these effects and enhanced A(2A)R expression above control levels. Radioligand binding assays confirm the affinity of STW 5 to the A(2A)R, and the A(2A)R antagonist was able to prevent the effect of STW 5 on TNBS-induced attenuation of the ACh contraction. Our findings provide evidence that STW 5, but not STW 6 interacts with A(2A)R, which is involved in the anti-inflammatory action of STW 5. STW 6 did not contribute to adenosine A(2A)R-mediated anti-inflammatory effect of STW 5. Other signaling pathways could be involved in the mechanism of action of STW 6.

It is believed to cause a selective destruction of substantia nigra dopamine neurons, mainly based on a large reduction of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the catecholamine's synthesizing enzyme. Unlike Parkinson's disease in humans, however, all animal models are able to recover more or less rapidly from the MPTP induced Parkinsonian syndrome. This raises the question as whether MPTP causes a cell death with a decrease in dopamine transporter or a simple impairment of TH. Methods: To respond to this question, we quantified in a cat model of Parkinson's disease (MPTP 5 mg/kg i.p. during 5 days) the dopamine transporter using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and autoradiography of [C-11]PE2I and compared the data with the TH-immunoreactivity. Results: We found no changes in [C-11]PE2I PET binding either 5 or 26 days after MPTP treatment when compared to baseline levels. Similarly, there were no significant changes in [C-11]PE2I autoradiographic binding in the cat brain one week after MPTP treatment. In sharp contrast, MPTP treated cats exhibited severe Parkinson-like motor syndrome during the acute period with a marked decrease in TH-immunoreactivity in the striatum. Conclusion: These data suggest that MPTP toxicity impairs efficiently TH and that such an effect is not necessarily accompanied by significant reduction of dopamine transporter seen with in vitro or in vivo [C-11]PE2I binding.

Thereby, this study investigated the influence of mass dose of laniquidar, desmethyl-loperamide and loperamide on the P-glycoprotein-mediated brain uptake of respectively, [C-11]-laniquidar and [C-11]-N-desmethyl-loperamide ([C-11]-dLop). Methods: Wild-type (WT) mice were injected intravenously with solutions of 5.6 MBq [C-11]-laniquidar (either no carrier added or 60 mg/kg laniquidar added) or with 5.0-7.4 MBq [C-11]-dLop (either no carrier added or 3 mg/kg desmethyl loperamide). Mice were killed, and brain and blood were collected, weighted and counted for radioactivity. Mdrla(-/-) knockout mice were incorporated as the control group. Results: Injection of C-11-laniquidar (no carrier added) in WT mice resulted in a statistical significant lower brain uptake (0.7 +/- 0.2 %ID/g) compared to the carrier-added formulation (60 mg/kg laniquidar) (3.1 +/- 0.3 VolD/g) (P=.004), while no statistical difference could be observed between formulations of [C-11]-dLop. The [C-11]-laniquidar and [C-11]-dLop blood concentrations were not significantly different between the tested formulations in WT mice. In control animals, no effect of mass amount on brain uptake of both tracers could be demonstrated. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the bivalent character of laniquidar, acting as a substrate at low doses and as a blocking agent for P-glycoprotein transport in the brain at higher doses. In comparison, no difference was observed in [C-11]-dLop uptake between carrier- and no-carrier-added formulations, which confirms that desmethyl-loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein at the blood brain barrier.

J	Seeman, P				Seeman, Philip			Dopamine Agonist Radioligand Binds to Both D2High and D2Low Receptors, Explaining Why Alterations in D2High Are Not Detected in Human Brain Scans	SYNAPSE			English	Article						dopamine D2 receptor; schizophrenia; dopamine supersensitivity; striatum; addiction	HIGH-AFFINITY STATE; D2(HIGH) RECEPTORS; IN-VITRO; EX-VIVO; D-2; PET; SCHIZOPHRENIA; AMPHETAMINE; PSYCHOSIS	The features of schizophrenia are consistent with increased sensitivity to endogenous dopamine. Animal models of schizophrenia reveal an increase in the in vitro proportion of striatal dopamine D2 receptors in the high-affinity state for dopamine (i.e., D2High), as measured by dopamine/[H-3] domperidone competition. However, in vivo studies did not reveal the dopamine agonist [C-11](+)PHNO to be elevated in amphetamine-sensitized rats. Also, no increase was found in the in vivo binding of [C-11](+)PHNO in schizophrenia patients. This work was done to resolve the contradictory findings. It was found that the in vitro density of rat striatal D2 receptors was 18 pmol/g for [H-3]raclopride and 12 pmol/g for [H-3](+)PHNO; most of the latter sites disappeared in the presence of guanine nucleotide. Using 2 nM [H-3](+)PHNO (K-d of 0.72 nM at D2) to label D2 receptors in the striata and the human D2 clone, 10 nM to 100 nM dopamine inhibited 10-20% of the [H-3](+)PHNO bound, representing high-affinity binding of [H-3](+)PHNO, with the remainder inhibited above 100 nM dopamine, representing low-affinity binding of [H-3](+)PHNO. It was found that (+)PHNO and (-)NPA dissociated from the D2 clone with half-times of 96 and 600 s, respectively. These rates are slower than the reported sub-second dissociation of the G protein from a receptor, suggesting that these two ligands still occupy the D2Low receptor after the G protein has separated. Thus, the radio-agonist label for (+)PHNO is not selective for dopamine D2High receptors, but also binds to the D2Low state of the dopamine receptor. Synapse 66:88-93, 2012.

Methods: At 0.5-24 h after the oral administration of propiverine at pharmacologically relevant doses, muscarinic receptors in tissue homogenates were measured by a radioligand binding assay using [N-methyl-(3)H] scopolamine (NMS), along with the drug's concentration in plasma by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method. Results: In the in vitro experiments, propiverine and its metabolite 1-methy-4-piperidyl benzilate N-oxide competed with [(3)H] NMS for binding sites in the bladder, submaxillary gland and heart of mice in a concentration-dependent manner. After the oral administration of propiverine, dose-and time-dependent increases in the dissociation constant for specific [(3)H] NMS binding were observed in the bladder and other tissues of mice, indicating that orally administered propiverine and/or its metabolite undergo significant binding to muscarinic receptors in mouse tissues. A longer-lasting binding of muscarinic receptor was seen in the bladder than in the submaxillary gland at relatively low doses of propiverine. Furthermore, the decrease in maximal number of binding sites values for [(3)H] NMS binding was more remarkable in the bladder than submaxillary gland of propiverine treated mice. There was a dose-dependent rise in the plasma concentrations of propiverine and 1-methy-4-piperidyl benzilate N-oxide in mice after the oral administration of propiverine. Conclusion: The oral administration of propiverine exerts a more prominent and longer-lasting effect in the bladder than in the submaxillary gland of mice. The N-oxide metabolite may contribute significantly to the blockade of muscarinic receptors caused by oral propiverine.

The present study was designed to evaluate the systemic and skin toxicity of chronic intravenous administration of the h-R3 in a relevant species demonstrated by comparing the h-R3 binding affinity constants (Kd) in microsomal placental fractions from Homo sapiens and Cercopithecus aethiops monkeys using an EGF-Receptor radioligand competition assay. The Kd obtained for Nimotuzumab were 9.1 x 10(-8) M for monkeys and 4.5 x 10(-8) M for humans. Monkeys (n = 18) were distributed into three groups with three animals of each sex in each group. Group I received saline; group II received 2.85 mg/kg of h-R3, - and group III received 28.57 mg/kg of the h-R3, which represent 1 and 10 times the human dose, and they were weekly intravenously treated during 26 weeks. During the study there were no deaths. Electroneurophysiological, sanguine chemistry and haematological results did not evidence alterations. Areas of haematomas, probably related with the administration procedure, were observed at the administration zones of all animals. The electrocardiography study showed at the end of the study a slight increase in the cardiac frequency of four treated animals without other signs. Unexpectedly, skin biopsies and a detailed clinical inspection of the animals did not detect the presence of cutaneous rash or any other skin toxicity sign reported for the majority of the anti-EGF-R monoclonal antibodies. It is concluded that doses up to 28.5 mg/kg of h-R3, intravenously administered during 26 weeks to Cercopithecus aethiops monkeys, do not produce considerable toxic effects.

Calcicludine binding to the outer pore of L-type calcium channels is allosterically coupled to dihydropyridine binding	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							HIGH-AFFINITY; CA2+ CHANNEL; POTASSIUM CHANNEL; MOLECULAR-BASIS; STRUCTURAL BASIS; SKELETAL-MUSCLE; BETA-SUBUNIT; TRANSITION; PHENYLALKYLAMINES; SELECTIVITY	How dihydropyridines modulate L-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is not known. Dihydropyridines bind cooperatively with Ca2+ binding to the selectivity filter, suggesting that they alter channel activity by promoting structural rearrangements in the pore. We used radioligand binding and patch-clamp electrophysiology to demonstrate that calcicludine, a toxin from the venom of the green mamba snake, binds in the outer vestibule of the pore and, like Ca2+, is a positive modulator of dihydropyridine binding. Data were fit using an allosteric scheme where dissociation constants for dihydropyridine and calcicludine binding, K-DHP and K-CaC, are linked via the coupling factor, alpha. Nine acidic amino acids located within the S5-Pore-helix segment of repeat III were sequentially changed to alanine in groups of three, resulting in the mutant channels, Mut-A, Mut-B, and Mut-C. Mut-A, whose substitutions are proximal to IIIS5, exhibits a 4.5-fold reduction in dihydropyridine binding and is insensitive to calcicludine binding. Block of Mut-A currents by calcicludine is indistinguishable from wild-type, indicating that K-CaC is unchanged and that the coupling between dihydropyridine and calcicludine binding (i.e., alpha) is disrupted. Mut-B and Mut-C possess K-DHP values that resemble that of the wild type. Mut-C, the most C-terminal of the mutant channels, is insensitive to calcicludine binding and block. K-CaC values for the Mut-C single mutants, E1122A, D1127A, and D1129A, increase from 0.3 (wild type) to 1.14, 2.00, and 20.5 mu M, respectively. Together, these findings suggest that dihydropyridine antagonist and calcicludine binding to L-type Ca2+ channels promote similar structural changes in the pore that stabilize the channel in a nonconducting, blocked state.

Cigarette smoking saturates brain α<sub>4</sub>β<sub>2</sub> nicotinic acetylcholine receptors	ARCHIVES OF GENERAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; INDUCED DOPAMINE RELEASE; WITHDRAWAL SYMPTOMS; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; TOBACCO SMOKING; BINDING-SITES; PET; REWARD; DRUGS; QUANTIFICATION	Context: 2-[F-18]fluoro-3-(2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy) pyridine (2-F-A-85380, abbreviated as 2-FA) is a recently developed radioligand that allows for visualization of brain alpha(4)beta(2)* nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) with positron emission tomography (PET) scanning in humans. Objective: To determine the effect of cigarette smoking on alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChR occupancy in tobacco-dependent smokers. Design: Fourteen 2- FA PET scanning sessions were performed. During the PET scanning sessions, subjects smoked 1 of 5 amounts (none, 1 puff, 3 puffs, 1 full cigarette, or to satiety [2(2)/(1) to 3 cigarettes]). Setting: Academic brain imaging center. Participants: Eleven tobacco-dependent smokers (paid volunteers). Main Outcome Measure: Dose-dependent effect of smoking on occupancy of alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChRs, as measured with 2-FA and PET in nAChR-rich brain regions. Results: Smoking 0.13 (1 to 2 puffs) of a cigarette resulted in 50% occupancy of alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChRs for 3.1 hours after smoking. Smoking a full cigarette (or more) resulted in more than 88% receptor occupancy and was accompanied by a reduction in cigarette craving. A venous plasma nicotine concentration of 0.87 ng/mL (roughly (25)/(1)th of the level achieved in typical daily smokers) was associated with 50% occupancy of alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChRs. Conclusions: Cigarette smoking in amounts used by typical daily smokers leads to nearly complete occupancy of alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChRs, indicating that tobacco-dependent smokers maintain alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChR saturation throughout the day. Because prolonged binding of nicotine to alpha(4)beta(2)* nAChRs is associated with desensitization of these receptors, the extent of receptor occupancy found herein suggests that smoking may lead to withdrawal alleviation by maintaining nAChRs in the desensitized state.

Because different nAChR subtypes may have unique functions, immunoprecipitation and ligand binding studies were done to identify their subunit composition. As in the rodent, alpha2, alpha4, alpha6, beta2, and beta3 nAChR subunit immunoreactivity was identified in monkey striatum. However, distinct from the rodent, the present results also revealed the novel presence of alpha3 nAChR subunit-immunoreactivity in this same region, but not that for alpha5 and beta4. Relatively high levels of alpha2 and alpha3 subunits were also identified in monkey cortex, in addition to alpha4 and beta2. Experiments were next done to determine whether striatal subunit expression was changed with nigrostriatal damage. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl- 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment decreased alpha6 and beta3 subunit immunoreactivity by similar to80% in parallel with the dopamine transporter, suggesting that they are predominantly expressed on nigrostriatal dopaminergic projections. In contrast, alpha3, alpha4, and beta2 subunit immunoreactivity was decreased similar to50%, whereas alpha2 was not changed. These data, together with those from dual immunoprecipitation and radioligand binding studies ([H-3] cytisine, I-125-alpha-bungarotoxin, and I-125-alpha-conotoxin MII) suggest the following: that alpha6beta2beta3, alpha6alpha4beta2beta3, and alpha3beta2* nAChR subtypes are present on dopaminergic terminals and that the alpha4beta2 subtype is localized on both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic neurons, whereas alpha2beta2* and alpha7 receptors are localized on nondopaminergic cells in monkey striatum. Overall, these results suggest that drugs targeting non-alpha7 nicotinic receptors may be useful in the treatment of disorders characterized by nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage, such as Parkinson's disease.

Ethanol reinforcement and high alcohol drinking behaviour have been postulated to be partially mediated by a neurobiological mechanism involving the ethanol-induced activation of the endogenous opioid system. Activation of opioid neural pathways by ethanol may include alterations in the processing, release and/or the receptor binding of opioid peptides. The aim of this work was to investigate the effects of acute ethanol administration on 6 opioid receptors in the rat mesocortical, meso-accumbens and nigrostriatal pathways by quantitative receptor autoradiography, using [H-3] (2-D-penicillamine, 5-D-penicillamine)-enkephalin as radioligand. A significant increase in [H-3] (2-D-penicillamine, 5-D-penicillamine)-enkephatin binding was observed in the substantia nigra pars reticulata 1 b after ethanol treatment. Two hours after drug exposure, ligand binding was significantly increased in the frontal and preftontal cortices, the core and shell regions of the nucleus accurnbens, and in the anterior-medial and medial-posterior regions of the caudate-putamen. In contrast, ligand binding was significantly decreased in the posterior region of the caudate-putamen 30 min after ethanol administration. The observed effects may reflect ethanol-induced changes in ligand binding affinity and/or in receptor density. Our results suggest that transitory changes in delta opioid receptors with different kinetic patterns may be involved in ethanol reinforcement and brain sensitivity to the drug. Ethanol-induced delta receptor up- and down-regulation mechanisms may participate in modulation of dopaminergic transmission in the mesocorticolimbic and nigrostriatal pathways.

Because Abeta peptides are thought to be causative for Alzheimer's disease, inhibiting gamma-secretase represents a potential treatment for this neurodegenerative condition. Whereas inhibitors directed at the active center of gamma-secretase inhibit the cleavage of all its substrates, certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs) have been shown to selectively reduce the production of the more amyloidogenic Abeta( 1 - 42) peptide without inhibiting alternative cleavages. In contrast to the majority of previous studies, however, we demonstrate that in cell-free systems the mode of action of selected NSAIDs and their derivatives, depending on the concentrations used, can either be classified as modulatory or inhibitory. At modulatory concentrations, a selective and, with respect to the substrate, noncompetitive inhibition of Abeta( 1 - 42) production was observed. At inhibitory concentrations, on the other hand, biochemical readouts reminiscent of a nonselective gamma-secretase inhibition were obtained. When these compounds were analyzed for their ability to displace a radiolabeled, transition-state analog inhibitor from solubilized enzyme, noncompetitive antagonism was observed. The allosteric nature of radioligand displacement suggests that NSAID-like inhibitors change the conformation of the gamma-secretase enzyme complex by binding to a novel site, which is discrete from the binding site for transition-state analogs and therefore distinct from the catalytic center. Consequently, drug discovery efforts aimed at this site may identify novel allosteric inhibitors that could benefit from a wider window for inhibition of gamma (42)-cleavage over alternative cleavages in the beta-amyloid precursor protein and, more importantly, alternative substrates.

NAD-299 (generic name robalzotan) is a new potential antidepressant with high affinity and selectivity for the 5-HT1A receptor. Objectives: The aim of this positron emission tomography (PET) study was to examine the extent and time-course of 5-HT1A occupancy by NAD-299 in the human brain, in relation to plasma concentration after escalating single oral doses. Methods: Five healthy male subjects received one or more single oral doses of NAD-299 (0.5, 2.5 and 10 mg) in aqueous solution under fasting conditions. Total and unbound (after ultrafiltration) plasma concentrations of NAD-299 were determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MC), over a tentative dosage interval of 8 h. Regional 5-HT1A receptor occupancy in brain was calculated by the simplified reference tissue model using the radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635. Results: After the 10 mg dose, occupancy was high in the raphe (62-85%) and neocortical regions (68-75%) at time for C-max, but had declined considerably (17-44%) at 7 h after dose intake. Conclusions: This study confirmed that the new selective 5-HT1A antagonist NAD-299 occupies 5-HT1A receptors in the living human brain in a dose-dependent manner following oral dosage. The curvilinear relationship between NAD-299 drug concentration and 5-HT1A receptor occupancy was established and can be used for dose selection in subsequent clinical patient studies.

To test the hypothesis that 5-HT1A receptor binding is reduced in human epileptic foci, PET imaging was performed using the radioligand [F-18]trans-4-fluoro-N-2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl-ethyl]-N-(2-pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide ([F-18]FCWAY), a selective 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy and normal controls. Methods: MRI and PET were performed using [O-15]water and [F-18]FCWAY in 10 controls and in 12 patients with temporal lobe epilepsy confirmed on ictal video-EEG; patients also underwent [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose PET. Using quantitative PET image analysis, regional values were obtained for [F-18]FCWAY volume of distribution (V), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and glucose cerebral metabolic rate (CMRglc). Hippocampal volume (HV) was also measured with MRI. [F-18]FCWAY V PET and MR measures were compared within patients and controls using paired t-tests; grouped comparisons were made with two sample t-tests. Results: Lower [F-18]FCWAY V was found ipsilateral than contralateral to the epileptic focus in inferior medial (IMT) and lateral (ILT) temporal regions of patients (ILT 47.4 +/- 6.1 vs 61.8 +/- 6.1, p < 0.01; IMT 52 +/- 4.6 vs 67.0 +/- 6.0, p < 0.01). [F-18]FCWAY V was 29% lower in raphe and 34% lower in the ipsilateral thalamic region of patients than controls. In ILT, mean [F-18]FCWAY V asymmetry index (AT) was significantly greater than mean CBF and mean CMRglc AI. Mean [F-18]FCWAY V AT in IMT was greater than mean HV AT, but the difference was not significant. Conclusion: These findings support the hypothesis of reduced serotonin receptor binding in temporal lobe epileptic foci.

To obtain an efficient radioactive ligand allowing the study of this transporter in vitro and in vivo, we synthesized a new diphenyl sulfide derivative, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-methylphenylthio) benzylamine or MADAM. We present here extensive pharmacological characterization of this compound. [H-3]MADAM bound to serotonin transporters with a very high affinity in vitro on rat cortical membranes, at least 2 times better than the most commonly used radioactive probes (K-d, 60 pM; B-max, 543 fmol/mg of protein). Competition studies showed few inhibitory effect of nisoxetine (K-i = 270 nM), no inhibitory effect of desipramine or 1-[2-(diphenylmethoxy) ethyl]-4-(3-phenylpropyl) piperazine (GBR 12935) (K-i >1000 nM), and strong effect of paroxetine (K-i = 0.32 nM) and citalopram (K-i = 1.57 nM). Therefore, MADAM has around 1000-fold better selectivity for the serotonin transporter than for other transporters. Autoradiographic studies both on rat and postmortem human brain slices demonstrated that the distribution of [H-3]MADAM parallels the localization of serotonin transporters and is prevented by known inhibitors of them. The high affinity and selectivity of [H-3]MADAM for the serotonin transporter show that it is very valuable for studies using in vitro approaches. The high selectivity and low nonspecific binding of [H-3]MADAM on the postmortem human brain, together with preliminary in vivo results with [C-11]MADAM, is a new argument for future use of this ligand in in vivo studies of the distribution, pharmacology, and pathophysiology of the serotonin transporter in the human brain with positron emission tomography.

J	Schetz, JA; Kim, OJ; Sibley, DR				Schetz, JA; Kim, OJ; Sibley, DR			Pharmacological characterization of mammalian D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> dopamine receptors expressed in <i>Drosophila</i> Schneider-2 cells	JOURNAL OF RECEPTORS AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION			English	Article						biogenic amine receptor; GPCR; over-expression; insect cell	FUNCTIONAL-CHARACTERIZATION; FATTY-ACIDS; MELANOGASTER; CLONING; BINDING; K1	Mammalian D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors were stably expressed in Drosophila Schneider-2 (S2) cells and screened for their pharmacological properties. Saturable, dose-dependent, high affinity binding of the D-1-selective antagonist [H-3]SCH-23390 was detected only in membranes from S2 cells induced to express rat dopamine D-1 receptors, while saturable, dose-dependent, high affinity binding of the D-2-selective antagonist [H-3]methylspiperone was detected only in membranes from S2 cells induced to express rat dopamine D-2 receptors. No specific binding of either radioligand could be detected in membranes isolated from uninduced or untransfected S2 cells. Both dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptor subtypes displayed the appropriate stereoselective binding of enantiomers of the nonselective antagonist butaclamol. Each receptor subtype also displayed the appropriate agonist stereoselectivities. The dopamine D-1 receptor bound the (+)-enantiomer of the D-1-selective agonist SKF38393 with higher affinity than the (-)-enantiomer, while the dopamine D-2 receptor bound the (-)-enantiomer of the D-2-selective agonist norpropylapomorphine with higher affinity than the (+)-enantiomer. At both receptor subtypes, dopamine binding was best characterized. as occurring to a single low affinity site. In addition, the low affinity dopamine binding was also found, to be insensitive to GTPgammaS and magnesium ions. Overall, the pharmacological profiles of mammalian dopamine D-1 and D-2 receptors expressed in Drosophila S2 cells is comparable to those observed for these same receptors when they are expressed in mammalian cell lines. A notable distinction is that there is no evidence for the coupling of insect G proteins to mammalian dopamine receptors. These results suggest that the S2 cell insect G system may provide a convenient source. of pharmacologically active mammalian D-1 and D-2 dopamine receptors free of promiscuous G protein contaminants.

Here we investigated the in vitro efficacy and potentially underlying mechanisms of TAM in established cell lines of squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck (SCCHN). Using proliferation and apoptosis assays the antitumor activity of TAM in five SCCHN and the breast carcinoma line MCF-7 (positive control) was determined. MCF-7 was more sensitive to low-dose TAM (below 1 muM), whereas SCCHN showed significant growth inhibition at higher TAM concentrations (5-10 muM). Growth curve analysis and apoptosis assays were indicative for a cytostatic effect of low-dose TAM and high-dose TAM led to cell loss by apoptosis in sensitive SCCHN. In order to further characterize the observed antitumor effects we determined the amount of steroid hormone receptors with the dextran-coated charcoal method and immunocytochemistry. In addition, production of transforming growth factor (TGF-)-alpha, -beta1 and -beta2 was measured by ELISA, and protein kinase C (PKC) activity was assessed with a radioligand assay. Except MCF-7, none of the SCCHN lines was positive for ER. TAM caused decreased TGF-alpha and increased TGF-beta levels in MCF-7, but not in SCCHN supernatants. Furthermore, the antiestrogen reduced PKC activity in MCF-7, but not In SCCHN. In the present in vitro system, the observed antitumor activity of high-dose TAM in SCCHN cannot be explained by estrogen antagonism, alterations of TGF-alpha/beta levels or decreased PKC activity.

Here, we characterize and compare [H-3]LY395153 binding to native AMPA receptors from rat cerebral cortex and recombinant human GluR4(flip) receptors expressed in HEK293 cells. L-Glutamate: and AMPA increased [H-3]LY395153 binding to both native and recombinant AMPA receptors in a concentration dependent and stereoselective manner; this effect of AMPA receptor agonists reflects an apparent increase in ligand affinity. In the presence of L-glutamate (500 muM), [H-3]LY395153 binding is saturable; the affinity of this radioligand is slightly, albeit statistically significantly higher at human GluR4(flip) (K-d=55.6 +/-5.3nM) than rat cortical receptors (K-d=110 +/- 15.1nM). NBQX competitively inhibited L-glutamate-induced increases in [H-3]LY395153 binding in both native and recombinant receptors, whilst LY303070 (the active isomer of GYKI53655) noncompetitively inhibited this effect in native, but not recombinant receptors. The prototypic AMPA receptor potentiator cyclothiazide competitively inhibited [H-3]LY395153 binding with a potency (K(i)similar to7 muM) comparable to EC,, values reported in electrophysiological studies. In contrast, the structurally unrelated AMPA receptor potentiator CX 516 did not inhibit [H-3]LY395153 binding at concentrations of up to 600 muM. Further, at concentrations reported to facilitate AMPA receptor desensitization, thiocyanate acts as a competitive inhibitor of [H-3]LY395153 binding. [H-3]LY395153 binding was unaffected by a variety of structurally land mechanistically) diverse compounds tested at a concentration of 10 muM. These data indicate [H-3]LY395153 is a useful probe for labeling a unique modulatory site on both native and recombinant AMPA receptors. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The therapeutic success of low doses of glucocorticoids is mediated entirely by classical genomic effects, whereas that of high doses is also mediated to an as yet unknown extent by nongenomic effects. We assessed the relative therapeutic importance of these nongenomic effects in pulse therapy. Methods. A [H-3]dexamethasone radioligand binding assay was used to measure the number of glucocorticoid receptor sites (R, given as number of sites per cell) and glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity (K-d, given in nM) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 26 healthy control blood donors and 27 patients with rheumatic diseases. Patients were divided into 4 groups on the basis of their glucocorticoid dose: 0 mg (Group A), less than or equal to 0.25 mg (Group B), 0.25 to 1 mg (Group C), and > 1 mg (Group D) of prednisolone equivalent per kg per day. Results. Sex independent normal values of 3605 +/- 1136 for R and 5.39 +/- 3.4 for K-d were found. Ar 5407 +/- 1968, the number of receptor sites in patients not receiving glucocorticoid therapy (Group A) was significantly higher than that of controls (p < 0.01). In patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy this value was reduced at 3855 +/- 866 (Group B), 3358 +/- 963 (Group C), and 2685 +/- 962 (Group D). The values in Groups C and D were significantly lower than those in untreated patients (p < 0.02). Conclusion. In pulse therapy doses of glucocorticoids that exceed receptor saturation are administered for several days, but in addition significant receptor downregulation occurs. Therefore, we assume an increase in the relative contribution of the nongenomic effects of glucocorticoids to the therapeutic success under these conditions.

We synthesized four new analogs related to GHRH (JV-1-50, JV-1-51, JV-1-52, and JV-1-53) with decreased GHRH antagonistic activity and increased VIP antagonistic potency. To characterize various peptide analogs for their antagonistic activity on receptors for GHRH and VIP, we developed assay systems based on superfusion of rat pituitary and pineal cells. Receptor-binding affinities of peptides to the membranes of these cells were also evaluated by radioligand competition assays. Previously reported GHRH antagonists JV-1-36, JV-1-38, and JV-1-42 proved to be selective for GHRH receptors, because they did not influence VIP-stimulated VPAC(2) receptor-dependent prolactin release from pituitary cells or VPAC(1) receptor-dependent cAMP efflux from pinealocytes but strongly inhibited GHRH-stimulated growth hormone (GH) release. Analogs JV-1-50, JV-1-51, and JV-1-52 showed various degrees of VPAC(1)-R and VPAC(2)-R antagonistic potency, although also preserving a substantial GHRH antagonistic effect. Analog JV-1-53 proved to be a highly potent VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) receptor antagonist, devoid of inhibitory effects on GHRH-evoked GH release. The antagonistic activity of these peptide analogs on processes mediated by receptors for GHRH and VIP was consistent with the binding affinity. The analogs with antagonistic effects on different types of receptors expressed on tumor cells could be utilized for the development of new approaches to treatment of various human cancers.

CCK-2R-mediated internalization and affinity of the new compounds were determined using AR42J cells. Biodistribution and mu SPECT/CT imaging studies at 1 and 24 h p.i. were carried out in AR42J tumor-bearing CB17-SCID mice. Both DOTA-containing minigastrin analogs exhibited 3- to 5-fold better IC50 values than their (R)-DOTAGA-counterparts. Lu-nat-labeled peptides revealed higher CCK-2R affinity than their Ga-nat-labeled analogs. In vivo, tumor uptake at 24 h p.i. of the most affine compound, [F-19]F-[Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18, was 1.5- and 13-fold higher compared to its (R)-DOTAGA derivative and the reference compound, [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-PP-F11N, respectively. However, activity levels in the kidneys were elevated as well. At 1 h p.i., tumor and kidney accumulation of [F-19]F-[Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 and [F-18]F-[Lu-nat]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 was high. We could demonstrate that the choice of chelators and radiometals has a significant impact on CCK-2R affinity and thus tumor uptake of minigastrin analogs. While elevated kidney retention of [F-19]F-[Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18 has to be further addressed with regard to radioligand therapy, its radiohybrid analog, [F-18]F-[Lu-nat]Lu-DOTA-rhCCK-18, might be ideal for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging due to its high tumor accumulation at 1 h p.i. and the attractive physical properties of fluorine-18.

In this Perspective, McClure-Begley and Roth discuss the promises and pitfalls of psychedelic pharmacology, including complex activity profiles beyond canonical 5-HT2A receptor activation that continue to be elucidated. They consider progress and challenges for clinical studies, as well as prospects for parsing the therapeutic from psychedelic effects of this class of compounds to develop 'cleaner' drugs. Psychedelic drugs including psilocybin, N,NMODIFIER LETTER PRIME-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are undergoing a renaissance as potentially useful drugs for various neuropsychiatric diseases, with a rapid onset of therapeutic activity. Notably, phase II trials have shown that psilocybin can produce statistically significant clinical effects following one or two administrations in depression and anxiety. These findings have inspired a 'gold rush' of commercial interest, with nearly 60 companies already formed to explore opportunities for psychedelics in treating diverse diseases. Additionally, these remarkable phenomenological and clinical observations are informing hypotheses about potential molecular mechanisms of action that need elucidation to realize the full potential of this investigative space. In particular, despite compelling evidence that the 5-HT2A receptor is a critical mediator of the behavioural effects of psychedelic drugs, uncertainty remains about which aspects of 5-HT2A receptor activity in the central nervous system are responsible for therapeutic effects and to what degree they can be isolated by developing novel chemical probes with differing specificity and selectivity profiles. Here, we discuss this emerging area of therapeutics, covering both controversies and areas of consensus related to the opportunities and perils of psychedelic and psychedelic-inspired therapeutics. We highlight how basic science breakthroughs can guide the discovery and development of psychedelic-inspired medications with the potential for improved efficacy without hallucinogenic or rewarding actions.

To develop [C-11]PF-06809247 into a clinically usable MAGL positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand, we assessed the occupancy of MAGL by an inhibitor in the non-human primate (NHP) brain. Additionally, we measured the whole-body distribution of [C-11]PF-06809247 in NHP and estimated human effective radiation doses. Methods Seven cynomolgus monkeys were enrolled for brain PET measurements. Two PET measurements along with arterial blood sampling were performed in each NHP: one baseline and one pretreatment condition with intravenous administration of PF-06818883, a pro-drug of a selective MAGL inhibitor (total of seven doses between 0.01 and 1.27 mg/kg). Kinetic parameters K-1, k(2) and k(3) were estimated by a two tissue compartment (2TC) model using metabolite corrected plasma radioactivity as the input function. k(4) was set as 0 according to the irreversible binding of [C-11]PF-06809247. K-i by 2TC and Patlak analysis were calculated as the influx constant. The target occupancy was calculated using K-i at baseline and pretreatment conditions. Two cynomolgus monkeys were enrolled for whole-body PET measurements. Estimates of the absorbed radiation dose in humans were calculated with OLINDA/EXM 1.1 using the adult male reference model. Results Radioactivity retention was decreased in all brain regions following pretreatment with PF-06818883. Occupancy was measured as 25.4-100.5% in a dose dependent manner. Whole-body PET showed high radioactivity uptake values in the liver, small intestine, kidney, and brain. The effective dose of [C-11]PF-06809247 was calculated as 4.3 mu Sv/MBq. Conclusions [C-11]PF-06809247 is a promising PET ligand for further studies of MAGL in the human brain.

We investigated the responsiveness of the bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) basilar artery to noradrenaline (NA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), angiotensin (Ang) II, bradykinin (BK), histamine (His), and acetylcholine (ACh). NA, 5-HT, Ang II, and BK induced contraction, whereas His and ACh induced relaxation, in a concentration-dependent manner. The NA cumulative concentration-response curve was shifted to the right in parallel with phentolamine (an alpha-antagonist). However, propranolol, a beta-antagonist, had no significant effect. The 5-HT curve was shifted to the right in parallel by ketanserin (a 5-HT2 antagonist) and methiothepin (a 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 antagonist). Losartan (an AT(1) antagonist) shifted the Ang II curve to the right, whereas PD123319 (an AT(2) antagonist) had no significant effect. L-NA, indomethacin, and des-Arg(9)-[Leu(8)]-BK (a B-1 antagonist) did not significantly affect BK-induced contractions. HOE140 (a B-2 antagonist) shifted the BK concentration-response curve to the right. The His curve was shifted to the right weakly by diphenhydramine (an H-1 antagonist) and strongly by cimetidine (a H-2 antagonist). ACh-induced relaxation was significantly inhibited by L-NA, atropine, and pFHHSiD (a muscarinic M-3 antagonist), whereas pirenzepine and methoctramine (muscarinic M-1 and M-2 antagonists, respectively) showed no significant effects. At a resting vascular tone, L-NA-induced contraction and indomethacin induced relaxation. These results suggest that alpha-adrenergic, 5-HT1, 5-HT2, AT(1), and B-2 receptors might be important in arterial contraction, whereas M-3 and H-2 (>H-1) receptors might modify these contractions, inducing relaxation.

Acute Lung Injury in Cholinergic-Deficient Mice Supports Anti-Inflammatory Role of α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						nicotinic acetylcholine receptors; muscarinic acetylcholine receptors; acute lung injury; PNU 282987; cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway	MUSCARINIC RECEPTORS; BRAIN-SLICES; RAT-BRAIN; BINDING; INFLAMMATION; AGONIST; METHYLLYCACONITINE; STIMULATION; PNU-282987; CYTISINE	(1) Background: The lung cholinergic pathway is important for controlling pulmonary inflammation in acute lung injury, a condition that is characterized by a sudden onset and intense inflammation. This study investigated changes in the expression levels of nicotinic and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR and mAChR) in the lung during acute lung injury. (2) Methods: acute lung injury (ALI) was induced in wild-type and cholinergic-deficient (VAChT-KDHOM) mice using intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) instillation with or without concurrent treatment with nicotinic ligands. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was collected to evaluate markers of inflammation, and then the lung was removed and processed for isolation of membrane fraction and determination of acetylcholine receptors level using radioligand binding assays. (3) Results: LPS-induced increase in lung inflammatory markers (e.g., neutrophils and IL-1 beta) was significantly higher in VAChT-KDHOM than wild-type mice. In contrast, LPS treatment resulted in a significant increase in lung's alpha 7 nicotinic receptor level in wild-type, but not in VAChT-KDHOM mice. However, treatment with PNU 282987, a selective alpha 7 nicotinic receptor agonist, restored VAChT-KDHOM mice's ability to increase alpha 7 nicotinic receptor levels in response to LPS-induced acute lung injury and reduced lung inflammation. LPS also increased muscarinic receptors level in VAChT-KDHOM mice, and PNU 282987 treatment reduced this response. (4) Conclusions: Our data indicate that the anti-inflammatory effects of the lung cholinergic system involve an increase in the level of alpha 7 nicotinic receptors. Pharmacological agents that increase the expression or the function of lung alpha 7 nicotinic receptors have potential clinical uses for treating acute lung injury.

A study of the structure-affinity relationship in SYA16263; is a D<sub>2</sub> receptor interaction essential for inhibition of apormorphine-induced climbing behavior in mice?	BIOORGANIC & MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Dopamine receptors; Serotonin receptors; Pyridinyl piperazine; D-2 subtype receptors; 5-HT subtype receptors; SYA16263; Apomorphine-induced climbing behavior	DOPAMINE-RECEPTORS; ANTIPSYCHOTIC EFFICACY; AGENT; DRUG; APOMORPHINE; DESIGN	Dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT) receptors are prime targets for the development of antipsychotics. The specific role of each receptor subtype to the pharmacological effects of antipsychotic drugs remains unclear. Understanding the relationship between antipsychotic drugs and their binding affinities at DA and 5-HT receptor subtypes is very important for antipsychotic drug discovery and could lead to new drugs with enhanced efficacies. We have previously disclosed SYA16263 (5) as an interesting compound with moderate radioligand binding affinity at the D-2 & D-3 receptors (Ki = 124 nM & 86 nM respectively) and high binding affinities towards D-4 and 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 3.5 nM & 1.1 nM respectively). Furthermore, we have demonstrated SYA16263 (5) is functionally selective and produces antipsychotic-like behavior but without inducing catalepsy in rats. Based on its pharmacological profile, we selected SYA16263 (5) to study its structure-affinity relationship with a view to obtaining new analogs that display receptor subtype selectivity. In this study, we present the synthesis of structurally modified SYA16263 (5) analogs and their receptor binding affinities at the DA and 5-HT receptor subtypes associated with antipsychotic action. Furthermore, we have identified compound 21 with no significant binding affinity at the D-2 receptor subtype but with moderate binding affinity at the D-3 and D-4 receptors subtypes. However, because 21 is able to demonstrate antipsychotic-like activity in a preliminary test, using the reversal of apomorphine-induced climbing behavior experiment in mice with SYA16263 and haloperidol as positive controls, we question the essential need of the D-2 receptor subtype in reversing apomorphine-induced climbing behavior.

Discovery of a Highly Selective Sigma-2 Receptor Ligand, 1-(4-(6,7-Dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1<i>H</i>)-yl)butyl)-3-methyl-1<i>H</i>-benzo[<i>d</i>]imidazol-2(3<i>H</i>)-one (CM398), with Drug-Like Properties and Antinociceptive Effects In Vivo	AAPS JOURNAL			English	Article						sigma receptors; sigma-2 receptor; neuropathic pain; formalin assay; pharmacokinetic	NEUROPATHIC PAIN; BIOLOGICAL EVALUATION; FORMALIN TEST; BINDING; IDENTIFICATION; PUBLICATION; DERIVATIVES; ANTAGONIST; MODULATION; BLOCKADE	The sigma-2 receptor has been cloned and identified as Tmem97, which is a transmembrane protein involved in intracellular Ca(2+)regulation and cholesterol homeostasis. Since its discovery, the sigma-2 receptor has been an extremely controversial target, and many efforts have been made to elucidate the functional role of this receptor during physiological and pathological conditions. Recently, this receptor has been proposed as a potential target to treat neuropathic pain due to the ability of sigma-2 receptor agonists to relieve mechanical hyperalgesia in mice model of chronic pain. In the present work, we developed a highly selective sigma-2 receptor ligand (sigma-1/sigma-2 selectivity ratio > 1000), 1-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-3-methyl-1H- benzo[d]imidazol-2(3H)-one (CM398), with an encouragingin vitroandin vivopharmacological profile in rodents. In particular, radioligand binding studies demonstrated that CM398 had preferential affinity for sigma-2 receptor compared with sigma-1 receptor and at least four other neurotransmitter receptors sites, including the norepinephrine transporter. Following oral administration, CM398 showed rapid absorption and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) occurred within 10 min of dosing. Moreover, the compound showed adequate, absolute oral bioavailability of 29.0%. Finally, CM398 showed promising anti-inflammatory analgesic effects in the formalin model of inflammatory pain in mice. The results collected in this study provide more evidence that selective sigma-2 receptor ligands can be useful tools in the development of novel pain therapeutics and altogether, these data suggest that CM398 is a suitable lead candidate for further evaluation.

Selective, high-contrast detection of syngeneic glioblastoma <i>in vivo</i>	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PERIPHERAL BENZODIAZEPINE-RECEPTORS; TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN LIGAND; F-18-FET PET; MICROGLIA; EXPRESSION; GLIOMA; TSPO; THALAMUS; BINDING; TARGET	Glioblastoma is a highly malignant, largely therapy-resistant brain tumour. Deep infiltration of brain tissue by neoplastic cells represents the key problem of diffuse glioma. Much current research focuses on the molecular makeup of the visible tumour mass rather than the cellular interactions in the surrounding brain tissue infiltrated by the invasive glioma cells that cause the tumour's ultimately lethal outcome. Diagnostic neuroimaging that enables the direct in vivo observation of the tumour infiltration zone and the local host tissue responses at a preclinical stage are important for the development of more effective glioma treatments. Here, we report an animal model that allows high-contrast imaging of wild-type glioma cells by positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]PBR111, a selective radioligand for the mitochondrial 18kDa Translocator Protein (TSPO), in the Tspo(-/-) mouse strain (C57BL/6-Tspo(tm1GuMu(GuwiyangWurra))). The high selectivity of [18F]PBR111 for the TSPO combined with the exclusive expression of TSPO in glioma cells infiltrating into null-background host tissue free of any TSPO expression, makes it possible, for the first time, to unequivocally and with uniquely high biological contrast identify peri-tumoral glioma cell invasion at preclinical stages in vivo. Comparison of the in vivo imaging signal from wild-type glioma cells in a null background with the signal in a wild-type host tissue, where the tumour induces the expected TSPO expression in the host's glial cells, illustrates the substantial extent of the peritumoral host response to the growing tumour. The syngeneic tumour (TSPO+/+) in null background (TSPO-/-) model is thus well suited to study the interaction of the tumour front with the peri-tumoral tissue, and the experimental evaluation of new therapeutic approaches targeting the invasive behaviour of glioblastoma.

The studies are focused on design, synthesis, biological evaluation and docking-supported SAR analysis for novel 5-HT6R agents as derivatives of lead structure 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-6-(phenoxymethyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (7). The lead modifications included an introduction of: (i) various small substituents at benzene ring, (ii) a branched ether linker or (iii) the ether oxygen replacement with other chalcogen (S, Se) or sulfonyl moiety. Hence, a series of new compounds (7-24) was synthesized and examined on their affinities for 5-HT6R and selectivity, in respect to the 5-HT1AR, 5-HT2AR, 5-HT7R and dopamine D-2 receptor, in the radioligand binding assays. For representative most active compounds functional bioassays and toxicity profile in vitro and antidepressant-like activity in vivo were examined. The 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenyl derivative (10) was found as the most active triazine 5-HT6R antagonist (K-i = 11 nM). SAR analysis indicated, that an exchange of oxygen to selenium (7 vs. 22), and especially, to sulfur (7 vs. 19) was beneficial to increase both affinity and antagonistic action for 5-HT6R. Surprisingly, an introduction of SO2 caused a drastic decrease of the 5-HT6R affinity, which was explained at a molecular level based on docking studies. All in vivo tested compounds (10, 18 and 21) did not show any risk of toxicity in the safety studies in vitro. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

Antidepressant medication exposure and 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptor binding in major depressive disorder	SYNAPSE			English	Article						5HT(1A) binding; antidepressant medications; duration of effect; major depressive disorder; medication naive vs; exposed; PET	SEROTONIN(1A) RECEPTOR-BINDING; ACUTE TRYPTOPHAN DEPLETION; 1A BINDING; TREATMENT RESPONSE; HUMANS; AGE	Objective: We have previously reported higher brain serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) autoreceptor binding in antidepressant-naive patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) compared with healthy volunteers, and a decrease in binding in MDD after selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment. This SSRI effect is also present in rodents administered SSRIs chronically. We therefore sought to determine the duration of antidepressant medication effects on 5-HT1A receptor binding after medication discontinuation. Methods: Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the 5-HT1A receptor radioligand [C-11]WAY-100635 was performed in 66 individuals with current DSM-IV MDD to examine relationships between 5-HT1A binding and time since most recent antidepressant treatment. All subjects were medication-free for at least 2 weeks prior to scanning. Thirty-two additional MDD comparison subjects were antidepressant naive. Results: No differences in [C-11]WAY-100635 binding were observed between antidepressant naive and antidepressant exposed MDD groups in 13 a priori cortical and subcortical regions of interest, including raphe autoreceptors, assessed simultaneously in linear mixed effects models. Furthermore, [C-11]WAY-100635 binding did not correlate with time off antidepressants in the antidepressant exposed patients considering these ROIs. The same results were observed when effects of treatment discontinuation of any psychotropic medication used to treat their depression was examined. Conclusion: These results indicate that any antidepressant-associated downregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptor binding reverses within 2 weeks of medication discontinuation. Since this effect is hypothesized to mediate the antidepressant action of SSRIs, and perhaps other antidepressants, it suggests that patients who need ongoing treatment may relapse rapidly when medication is discontinued. Moreover, 2 weeks appears to be a sufficiently long washout of antidepressant medications for a reliable measure of illness-related binding levels.	[Metts, A. V.; Rubin-Falcone, H.; Ogden, R.

In this study we evaluated the binding of two chemically different tau-specific PET tracers (C-11-THK5351 and C-11-PBB3) in a head-to-head, in vivo, multimodal design. Nine patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer's disease and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker evidence supportive of the presence of Alzheimer's disease brain pathology were recruited after thorough clinical assessment. All patients underwent imaging with the tau-specific PET tracers C-11-THK5351 and C-11-PBB3 on the same day, as well as imaging with the amyloid-beta-specific tracer C-11-AZD2184, a T1-MRI sequence, and neuropsychological assessment. The load and regional distribution of binding differed between C-11-THK5351 and C-11-PBB3 with no statistically significant regional correlations observed between the tracers. The binding pattern of C-11-PBB3, but not that of C-11-THK5351, in the temporal lobe resembled that of C-11-AZD2184, with strong correlations detected between C-11-PBB3 and C-11-AZD2184 in the temporal and occipital lobes. Global cognition correlated more closely with C-11-THK5351 than with C-11-PBB3 binding. Similarly, cerebrospinal fluid tau measures and entorhinal cortex thickness were more closely correlated with C-11-THK5351 than with C-11-PBB3 binding. This research suggests different molecular targets for these tracers; while C-11-PBB3 appeared to preferentially bind to tau deposits with a close spatial relationship to amyloid-beta, the binding pattern of C-11-THK5351 fitted the expected distribution of tau pathology in Alzheimer's disease better and was more closely related to downstream disease markers.

Here, we characterized the binding of radiolabelled [H-3] SB269,652 to human dopamine D3 receptor stably expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells. Under saturating conditions, SB269,652 showed a KD value of approximate to 1 nM. Consistent with high selectivity for human dopamine D-3 receptor, [H-3] SB269,652 binding was undetectable in cells expressing human dopamine D-1, D-2L or D-4 receptors and absent in synaptosomes from dopamine D-3 receptor knockout vs. wild-type mice. In contrast to saturation binding experiments, the dissociation kinetics of [H-3] SB269,652 from human dopamine D-3 receptors initiated with an excess of unlabelled ligand were best fitted by a bi-exponential binding model. Supporting the kinetic data, competition experiments with haloperidol, S33084 (a dopamine D-3 receptor antagonist) or dopamine, were best described by a two-site model. In co-transfection experiments binding of SB269,652 to dopamine D3 receptor was able to influence the functional coupling of dopamine D-2 receptor, supporting the notion that SB269,652 is a negative allosteric modulator across receptor dimers. However, because SB269,652 decreases the rate of [H-3] nemonapride dissociation, the present data suggest that SB269,652 behaves as a bitopic antagonist at unoccupied dopamine D3 receptor, binding simultaneously to both orthosteric and allosteric sites, and as a pure negative allosteric modulator when receptors are occupied and it can solely bind to the allosteric site.

Among others, CB2R agonist A-836339 has been labeled with carbon-11 for PET imaging of the CB2R and displayed promising results in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The aim of the present work was to develop fluorinated analogs of A-836339 for labeling with fluorine-18 to design a new PET tracer for CB2R imaging. Seven fluorinated analogs of A-836339 were synthesized in two to three steps and their binding affinities and selectivities for both the human and the mouse CB2R were measured as well as their early ADME profiles. Among them, compound 2f (K-ihCB2R = 0.1 nM, K-ihCB1R/K-ihCB2R = 300) displayed high affinity and selectivity for CB2R but also promising lipophilicity, kinetic solubility, and membrane permeation properties and was further selected for in vitro metabolism studies. Incubation of 2f with human or rat liver microsomes followed by LC/MS analysis revealed the presence of six different metabolites mainly resulting from oxidation reactions. A tosylated precursor of 2f was synthesized in two steps and radiolabeled with fluorine-18 to afford [F-18]2f in 15 +/- 5% radiochemical yield and a molar activity of 110 +/- 30 GBq/mu mol. Autoradiographies of rat spleen and biodistribution studies in healthy rats including pretreatments with either CB2R or CB1R-specific compounds suggested that [F-18]2f is a specific tracer for the CB2R in vivo. We have therefore demonstrated here that [F-18]2f is a promising novel tracer for imaging CB2R in vivo using PET. Further investigation in animal models of inflammation will follow.

Bradykinin (BK) is an endothelium-dependent agonist that induces relaxation followed by contraction of the porcine basilar artery through release of NO and PGF(2 alpha), respectively. In this study, we evaluated the effect of Ang II-induced hypertension on basilar artery responsiveness to BK in the Microminipig (MMPig). Ang II (200 ng/kg/min) or vehicle was infused into MMPigs for 14 days using an osmotic mini-pump and blood pressure was monitored regularly. The responsiveness of subsequently isolated basilar arteries was then measured using a micro organ bath system. MMPig basilar artery endothelial cells were cultured and stimulated with Ang II or vehicle for 48 h. Mean blood pressure was significantly (P < 0.05; n = 5) higher in Ang II-infused MMPigs than in vehicle-infused MMPigs. In vitro, BK-induced endothelium-dependent dilation of isolated basilar artery specimens was abolished and BK-induced contraction was significantly increased (E-max: 15.85 +/- 2.42% and 56.54 +/- 2.71% of 60 mM KCl in control and Ang II group respectively at 10(-7) M concentration of BK; P < 0.01; n = 5) in Ang II-infused MMPigs. Ang II stimulation of the endothelial cells significantly decreased (54.15% at 24 h; P < 0.05; n = three independent experiment performed in triplicate) the amount of BK-elicited NO and increased (44.27% at 24 h; P < 0.05; n = three independent experiment performed in triplicate) the amount of BK-elicited PGF2 alpha. These results suggest that the decrease of NO and increase of PGF(2 alpha) production from endothelial cells are responsible for cerebrovascular dysfunction in hypertension, possibly causing cerebrovascular contraction and thus increasing the risk of brain infarction.

The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of several variables with possible influence on PSMA ligand uptake in a large cohort. We performed a retrospective analysis of 1007 consecutive patients who were scanned with Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT (1 h after injection) from January 2014 to January 2017 to detect recurrent disease. Patients with untreated primary PCa or patients referred for PSMA radioligand therapy were excluded. The possible effects of different variables including PSA level and PSA doubling time (PSA(DT)), PSA velocity (PSA(Vel)), Gleason score (GSC, including separate analysis of GSC 7a and 7b), ongoing androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), patient age and amount of injected activity were evaluated. In 79.5% of patients at least one lesion with characteristics suggestive of recurrent PCa was detected. A pathological (positive) PET/CT scan was associated with PSA level and ADT. GSC, amount of injected activity, patient age, PSA(DT) and PSA(Vel) were not associated with a positive PET/CT scan in multivariate analysis. Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT detects tumour lesions in a high percentage of patients with recurrent PCa. Tumour detection is clearly associated with PSA level and ADT. Only a tendency for an association without statistical significance was found between higher GSC and a higher probability of a pathological PET/CT scan. No associations were found between a pathological Ga-68-PSMA-11 PET/CT scan and patient age, amount of injected activity, PSA(DT) or PSA(Vel.).

At the interface of the extracellular domains of adjacent subunits lies the acetylcholine binding site, composed of a principal component provided by one subunit and a complementary component of the adjacent subunit. Compared with neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine cholinergic receptors (nAChRs) assembled from a and beta subunits, the alpha 9 alpha 10 receptor is an atypical member of the family. It is a heteromeric receptor composed only of a subunits. Whereas mammalian alpha 9 subunits can form functional homomeric alpha 9 receptors, alpha 10 subunits do not generate functional channels when expressed heterologously. Hence, it has been proposed that alpha 10 might serve as a structural subunit, much like a b subunit of heteromeric nAChRs, providing only complementary components to the agonist binding site. Here, we have made use of site-directed mutagenesis to examine the contribution of subunit interface domains to alpha 9 alpha 10 receptors by a combination of electrophysiological and radioligand binding studies. Characterization of receptors containing Y190T mutations revealed unexpectedly that both alpha 9 and alpha 10 subunits equally contribute to the principal components of the alpha 9 alpha 10 nAChR. In addition, we have shown that the introduction of a W55T mutation impairs receptor binding and function in the rat alpha 9 subunit but not in the alpha 10 subunit, indicating that the contribution of alpha 9 and alpha 10 subunits to complementary components of the ligand-binding site is non-equivalent. We conclude that this asymmetry, which is supported by molecular docking studies, results from adaptive amino acid changes acquired only during the evolution of mammalian alpha 10 subunits.

Hippocampal Neuroinflammation, Functional Connectivity, and Depressive Symptoms in Multiple Sclerosis	BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						Depression; Hippocampus; Multiple sclerosis; Neuroimaging; Neuroinflammation; TSPO	TRANSLOCATOR PROTEIN; MAJOR DEPRESSION; 18 KDA; INFLAMMATION; BRAIN; EXPRESSION; MICROGLIA; CYTOKINES; ATROPHY; BINDING	BACKGROUND: Depression, a condition commonly comorbid with multiple sclerosis (MS), is associated more generally with elevated inflammatory markers and hippocampal pathology. We hypothesized that neuroinflammation in the hippocampus is responsible for depression associated with MS. We characterized the relationship between depressive symptoms and hippocampal microglial activation in patients with MS using the 18-kDa translocator protein radioligand [F-18]PBR111. To evaluate pathophysiologic mechanisms, we explored the relationships between hippocampal neuroinflammation, depressive symptoms, and hippocampal functional connectivities defined by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. METHODS: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) was administered to 11 patients with MS and 22 healthy control subjects before scanning with positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging. We tested for higher [F-18]PBR111 uptake in the hippocampus of patients with MS relative to healthy control subjects and examined the correlations between [F-18]PBR111 uptake, BDI scores, and hippocampal functional connectivities in the patients with MS. RESULTS: Patients with MS had an increased hippocampal [F-18]PBR111 distribution volume ratio relative to healthy control subjects (p = .024), and the hippocampal distribution volume ratio was strongly correlated with the BDI score in patients with MS (r = .86, p = .006). Hippocampal functional connectivities to the subgenual cingulate and prefrontal and parietal regions correlated with BDI scores and [F-18]PBR111 distribution volume ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that hippocampal microglial activation in MS impairs the brain functional connectivities in regions contributing to maintenance of a normal affective state. Our results suggest a rationale for the responsiveness of depression in some patients with MS to effective control of brain neuroinflammation. Our findings also lend support to further investigation of the role of inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of depression more generally.

We coupled cecropin B, an antimicrobial peptide, to LHRH', a form of LHRH modified at carboxyl-terminal residues 4-10, which binds to LHRHr without interfering with luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion. This study aimed to assess the antitumor effects of cecropin B-LHRH' (CB-LHRH') in drug-resistant ovarian and endometrial cancers. Methods: To evaluate the antitumor effects of CB-LHRH', three drug resistant ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV-3, ES-2, NIH:OVCAR-3) and an endometrial cancer cell line (HEC-1A) were treated with CB-LHRH'. Cell morphology changes were assessed using inverted and electron microscopes. In addition, cell growth and cell cytotoxicity were measured by MTT assay and LDH release, respectively. In addition, hemolysis was measured. Furthermore, radioligand receptor binding, hypersensitization and minimal inhibitory concentrations (against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii) were determined. Finally, the impact on tumor growth in BALB/c-nu mice was assessed in an ES-2 xenograft model. Results: CB-LHRH' bound LHRHr with high-affinity (dissociation constant, Kd = 0.252 +/- 0.061nM). Interestingly, CB-LHRH' significantly inhibited the cell viability of SKOV-3, ES-2, NIH: OVCAR-3 and HEC-1A, but not that of normal eukaryotic cells. CB-LHRH' was active against bacteria at micromolar concentrations, and caused no hypersensitivity in guinea pigs. Furthermore, CB-LHRH' inhibited tumor growth with a 23.8 and 20.4 % reduction in tumor weight at 50 and 25 mg/kg.d, respectively. Conclusions: CB-LHRH' is a candidate for targeted chemotherapy against ovarian and endometrial cancers.

Validation for this target comes from antibodies targeting interleukin-17 (IL-17), the signature cytokine produced by T(H)17 cells, which have shown impressive results in clinical trials. Through focused screening of our compound collection, we identified a series of N-sulfonylated benzoxazepines, which displayed micromolar affinity for the ROR gamma ligand-binding domain (LBD) in a radioligand binding assay. Optimization of these initial hits resulted in potent binders, which dose-dependently decreased the ability of the ROR gamma-LBD to interact with a peptide derived from steroid receptor coactivator 1, and inhibited the release of IL-17 secretion from isolated and cultured human T(H)17 cells with nanomolar potency. A cocrystal structure of inverse agonist 15 (2-chloro-6-fluoro-N-(4-{[3-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl] sulfonyl}-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzoxazepin-7-yl) benzamide) bound to the ROR gamma-LBD illustrated that both hydrophobic interactions, leading to an induced fit around the substituted benzamide moiety of 15, as well as a hydrogen bond from the amide NH to His479 seemed to be important for the mechanism of action. This structure is compared with the structure of agonist 25 (N-(2-fluorophenyl)-4[(4-fluorophenyl) sulfonyl]-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzoxazepin6-amine) and structures of other known ROR gamma modulators.

Lower Monoamine Oxidase-A Total Distribution Volume in Impulsive and Violent Male Offenders with Antisocial Personality Disorder and High Psychopathic Traits: An [<SUP>11</SUP>C] Harmine Positron Emission Tomography Study	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							AGGRESSIVE-BEHAVIOR; HUMAN-BRAIN; RADIOLIGAND BINDING; ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE; FOLLOW-UP; MAO-A; RECEPTOR; CORTEX; DOPAMINE; MICE	Antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) often presents with highly impulsive, violent behavior, and pathological changes in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and ventral striatum (VS) are implicated. Several compelling reasons support a relationship between low monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A), an enzyme that regulates neurotransmitters, and ASPD. These include MAO-A knockout models in rodents evidencing impulsive aggression and positron emission tomography (PET) studies of healthy subjects reporting associations between low brain MAO-A levels and greater impulsivity or aggression. However, a fundamental gap in the literature is that it is unknown whether brain MAO-A levels are low in more severe, clinical disorders of impulsivity, such as ASPD. To address this issue, we applied [C-11] harmine PET to measure MAO-A total distribution volume (MAO-A V-T), an index of MAO-A density, in 18 male ASPD participants and 18 age- and sex-matched controls. OFC and VS MAO-A VT were lower in ASPD compared with controls (multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA): F-2,F-33 = 6.8, P = 0.003; OFC and VS MAO-A V-T each lower by 19%). Similar effects were observed in other brain regions: prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsal putamen, thalamus, hippocampus, and midbrain (MANOVA: F-7,F-28 = 2.7, P = 0.029). In ASPD, VS MAO-A V-T was consistently negatively correlated with self-report and behavioral measures of impulsivity (r = -0.50 to -0.52, all P-values<0.05). This study is the first to demonstrate lower brain MAO-A levels in ASPD. Our results support an important extension of preclinical models of impulsive aggression into a human disorder marked by pathological aggression and impulsivity.

However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms and the fate of the transplanted cells. The objective of the presented work was to determine the feasibility of PET imaging and in vivo monitoring after transplantation of dopamine type 2 receptor-expressing cells. Methods: An hMSC line constitutively expressing a mutant of the dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R80A) was generated by lentiviral gene transfer. D2R80A messenger RNA expression was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Localization of the transmembrane protein was analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. The stem cell character of transduced hMSCs was investigated by adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Migration capacity was assessed by scratch assays in time-lapse imaging. In vitro specific binding of ligands was tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and by radioligand assay using F-18-fallypride. Imaging of D2R80A overexpressing hMSC transplanted into athymic rats was performed by PET using F-18-fallypride. Results: hMSCs showed long-term overexpression of D2R80A. As expected, the fluorescence signal suggested the primary localization of the protein in the membrane of the transduced cells. hMSC and D2R80A retained their stem cell character demonstrated by their osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation capacity and their proliferation and migration behavior. For in vitro hMSCs, at least 90% expressed the D2R80A transgene and hMSC-D2R80A showed specific binding of F-18-fallypride. In vivo, a specific signal was detected at the transplantation site up to 7 d by PET. Conclusion: The mutant of the dopamine type 2 receptor (D2R80A) is a potent reporter to detect hMSCs by PET in vivo.

The rat adenine receptor: pharmacological characterization and mutagenesis studies to investigate its putative ligand binding site	PURINERGIC SIGNALLING			English	Article						Antibody; G protein-coupled receptor; Mutagenesis; Radioligand binding; Rat adenine receptor; Sf9 cells; Signal peptide	PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTOR; 2ND EXTRACELLULAR LOOP; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; CONSTITUTIVE ACTIVITY; CYSTEINE RESIDUES; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; SIGNAL-PEPTIDE; HIGH-AFFINITY; SF9 CELLS; IDENTIFICATION	The rat adenine receptor (rAdeR) was the first member of a family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activated by adenine and designated as P0-purine receptors. The present study aimed at gaining insights into structural aspects of ligand binding and function of the rAdeR. We exchanged amino acid residues predicted to be involved in ligand binding (Phe110(3.24), Asn115(3.29), Asn173(4.60), Phe179(45.39), Asn194(5.40), Phe195(5.41), Leu201(5.47), His252(6.54), and Tyr268(7.32)) for alanine and expressed them in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells. Membrane preparations subjected to [H-3]adenine binding studies revealed only minor effects indicating that none of the exchanged amino acids is part of the ligand binding pocket, at least in the inactive state of the receptor. Furthermore, we coexpressed the rAdeR and its mutants with mammalian G(i) proteins in Sf9 insect cells to probe receptor activation. Two amino acid residues, Asn194(5.40) and Leu201(5.47), were found to be crucial for activation since their alanine mutants did not respond to adenine. Moreover we showed that-in contrast to most other rhodopsin-like GPCRs-the rAdeR does not contain essential disulfide bonds since preincubation with dithiothreitol neither altered adenine binding in Sf9 cell membranes, nor adenine-induced inhibition of adenylate cyclase in 1321N1 astrocytoma cells transfected with the rAdeR. To detect rAdeRs by Western blot analysis, we developed a specific antibody. Finally, we were able to show that the extended N-terminal sequence of the rAdeR constitutes a putative signal peptide of unknown function that is cleaved off in the mature receptor. Our results provide important insights into this new, poorly investigated family of purinergic receptors.

However, dedicated experimental settings for small-animal studies are still lacking. The aim of the present study was therefore to develop and evaluate suitable pharmacokinetic models for the quantification of the cerebral A(1)AR in high-resolution PET. Methods: On a dedicated animal PET scanner, 15 rats underwent F-18-CPFPX PET scans of 120-min duration. In all animals, arterial blood samples were drawn and corrected for metabolites. The radioligand was injected either as a bolus or as a bolus plus constant infusion. For the definition of unspecific binding, the A(1)AR selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX) was applied. After PET, the brains of 9 animals were dissected and in vitro saturation binding was performed using high-resolution H-3-DPCPX autoradiography. Results: The kinetics of F-18-CPFPX were well described by either compartmental or noncompartmental models based on arterial input function. The resulting distribution volume ratio correlated with a low bias toward identity with the binding potential derived from a reference region (olfactory bulb) approach. Furthermore, PET quantification correlated significantly with autoradiographic in vitro data. Blockade of the A(1)AR with DPCPX identified specific binding of about 45% in the reference region olfactory bulb. Conclusion: The present study provides evidence that F-18-CPFPX PET based on a reference tissue approach can be performed quantitatively in rodents in selected applications. Specific binding in the reference region needs careful consideration for quantitative investigations.

Novel opioid cyclic tetrapeptides: Trp isomers of CJ-15,208 exhibit distinct opioid receptor agonism and short-acting κ opioid receptor antagonism	BRITISH JOURNAL OF PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						kappa-opioid; agonist; antagonist; analgesic; antinociception; CJ-15; 208; conditioned place preference; cocaine; cyclic tetrapeptide	COCAINE-SEEKING; IN-VIVO; BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION; INDUCED REINSTATEMENT; PLACE PREFERENCE; A ANALOGS; STRESS; PEPTIDE; POTENT; BIOTRANSFORMATION	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE The kappa opioid receptor antagonists demonstrate potential for maintaining abstinence from psychostimulant abuse, but existing non-peptide kappa-receptor selective antagonists show exceptionally long activity. We hypothesized that the L- and D-Trp isomers of CJ-15,208, a natural cyclic tetrapeptide reported to be a kappa-receptor antagonist in vitro, would demonstrate short-acting, dose-dependent antagonism in vivo, preventing reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behaviour. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Affinity, selectivity and efficacy of the L-Trp and D-Trp isomers for opioid receptors were assessed in vitro in radioligand and GTPgS binding assays. Opioid receptor agonist and antagonist activities were characterized in vivo following i.c.v. administration with the 55 C warm water tail-withdrawal assay. The D-Trp isomer, which demonstrated primarily kappa-receptor selective antagonist activity, was further evaluated for its prevention of stress-and drug-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP). KEY RESULTS The two isomers showed similar affinity and selectivity for k receptors (K-i 30-35 nM) as well as kappa receptor antagonism in vitro. As expected, the D-Trp cyclic tetrapeptide exhibited minimal agonist activity and induced dose-dependent kappa-receptor selective antagonism lasting less than 18 h in vivo. Pretreatment with this peptide prevented stress-, but not cocaine-induced, reinstatement of extinguished cocaine CPP. In contrast, the L-Trp cyclic tetrapeptide unexpectedly demonstrated mixed opioid agonist/antagonist activity. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The L-Trp and the D-Trp isomers of CJ-15,208 demonstrate stereospecific opioid activity in vivo. The relatively brief kappa opioid receptor antagonism, coupled with the prevention of stress-induced reinstatement of extinguished cocaine-seeking behaviour, suggests the D-Trp isomer could be used therapeutically to maintain abstinence from psychostimulant abuse.

[2005] Bioorg Med Chem 13:77-87). In this study, WC-10 was radiolabeled with tritium (specific activity = 80 Ci/mmol), and quantitative autoradiography studies were conducted using rhesus monkey and Sprague-Dawley rat brain sections. K-d values for the binding of [H-3]WC-10 to D-3 receptors obtained from quantitative autoradiography with rhesus monkey and rat brain sections are in agreement with K-d values obtained from cloned human and rat receptors (Xu et al. [2009] Synapse 63:717-728). The D-2 selective antagonist [H-3]raclopride binds with 11-fold higher affinity to human HEK D-2L (K-d = 1.6 nM) than HEK D-3 (K-d = 18 nM) receptors; [H-3]raclopride binds to rat Sf9 rD(2L) receptors with a K-d of 6.79 nM, a value that is 4-fold lower than binding to human HEK D-2L receptors and 2.5-fold higher than binding to rat Sf9 rD(3) receptors. In vitro quantitative autoradiography studies with [H-3]WC-10 and [H-3]raclopride were conducted on adult rat and rhesus monkey brain sections. A mathematical model for calculating the absolute densities of dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors based on the in vitro receptor binding data of [H-3]WC-10 and [H-3]raclopride was developed.

The goal of the study was to evaluate a high affinity and high selectivity antagonist, [C-11]P943, as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging the 5-HT1B receptor. [C-11]P943 was synthesized via N-methylation of the precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide or [C-11]methyl triflate using automated modules. The average radiochemical yield was approx. 10% with radiochemical purity of >99% and specific activity of 8.8 +/- 3.6 mCi/nmol at the end-of-synthesis (n=37). PET imaging was performed in non-human primates with a high-resolution research tomograph scanner with a bolus/infusion paradigm. Binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the equilibrium ratios of regions to cerebellum. The tracer uptake was highest in the globus pallidus and occipital cortex, moderate in basal ganglia and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum, which is consistent with the known brain distribution of 5-HT1B receptors. Infusion of tracer at different specific activities (by adding various amount of unlabeled P943) reduced BPND values in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the saturability of the tracer binding. Blocking studies with GR127935 (2 mg/kg iv), a selective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D antagonist, resulted in reduction of BPND values by 42-95% across regions; for an example, in occipital region from 0.71 to 0.03, indicating a complete blockade. These results demonstrate the saturability and specificity of [C-11]P943 for 5-HT1B receptors, suggesting its suitability as a PET radiotracer for in vivo evaluations of the 5-HT1B receptor system in humans.

Rats were treated for 14 days with Org 34850 (15 mg per kg per day subcutaneously), fluoxetine ( 10 mg per kg per day intraperitoneally), or a combination of both drugs. [H-3]-citalopram binding (an index of 5-HT transporter (5-HTT) expression) was only slightly affected by Org 34850 alone: decreased in cortex and midbrain and increased in hippocampus. In contrast, chronic fluoxetine markedly decreased 5-HTT levels in all regions. Importantly, this decrease was significantly enhanced by combined Org 34850/fluoxetine treatment. There were no changes in the expression of 5-HTT mRNA, suggesting these effects were not due to changes in gene transcription. Expression of tryptophan hydroxylase mRNA and both 5-HT1A autoreceptor mRNA and protein (assessed using [H-3]-8-OH-DPAT binding) were unchanged by any treatment. The expression of postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor protein in the forebrain was unaltered by fluoxetine, Org 34850 or the combined Org 34850/fluoxetine treatment. This downregulation of 5-HTT by fluoxetine and its enhancement by Org 34850 can explain our recent observation that GR antagonists augment the SSRI-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT. In addition, these data suggest that the augmentation of forebrain 5-HT does not result in downregulation of forebrain 5-HT1A receptor expression. Given the importance of 5-HT1A receptor-mediated transmission in the forebrain to the antidepressant response, these data indicate that co-administration of GR antagonists may be effective in augmenting the antidepressant response to SSRI treatment.

The present positron emission tomography (PET) study investigated the influence of sex on the major inhibitory serotonergic receptor subtype, the serotonin-1A (5-HT1A) receptor. Methods Sixteen healthy women and 16 healthy men were measured using PET and the highly specific radioligand [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635. Effects of age or gonadal hormones were excluded by restricting the inclusion criteria to young adults and by controlling for menstrual cycle phase. The 5-HT1A receptor BPND was quantified using (1) the 'gold standard' manual delineation approach with ten regions of interest (ROIs) and (2) a newly developed delineation method using a PET template normalized to the Montreal Neurologic Institute space with 45 ROIs based on automated anatomical labeling. Results The 5-HT1A receptor BPND was found equally distributed in men and women applying both the manual delineation method and the automated delineation approach. Women had lower mean BPND values in every region investigated, with a borderline significant sex difference in the hypothalamus (p=0.012, uncorrected). There was a high intersubject variability of the 5-HT1A receptor BPND within both sexes compared to the small mean differences between men and women. Conclusions To conclude, when measured in the follicular phase, women do not differ from men in the 5-HT1A receptor binding. To explain the higher prevalence of affective disorders in women, further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship between hormonal status and the 5-HT1A receptor expression.

Physiological significance of high- and low-affinity agonist binding to neuronal and recombinant AMPA receptors	NEUROCHEMISTRY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						GluR2; GluR3; steady-state desensitization; excised patch recordings; deactivation time constants; stargazin	SELECTIVE GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; METHYL-D-ASPARTATE; RAT-BRAIN; QUISQUALATE RECEPTORS; ALLOSTERIC MODULATORS; STABLE EXPRESSION; DIFFERENTIAL REGULATION; HIPPOCAMPAL SLICES; SINGLE RECEPTOR; THIOL-REAGENTS	Radioligand binding studies have shown that AMPA receptors exist in two variants that differ about twentyfold in their binding affinities, with brain receptors being mainly of the low-affinity type and recombinantly expressed receptors having almost exclusively high affinity. However, the physiological correlate of high- and low-affinity binding is not yet known. in this study we examined if physiological experiments similarly reveal evidence for two distinct receptor variants. We therefore measured equilibrium desensitization by glutamate and determined IC50 values for neuronal receptors and for the homomeric receptors GluR1-4 expressed in HEK293 cells. Contrary to the prediction that these IC50 values exhibit large differences commensurate with those of high- and low-affinity binding, values for homomeric receptors (1-18 mu M) were on an average not different from those of neuronal receptors (3-10 mu M). Moreover, simulations with kinetic receptor models suggest that the IC50 Values for neuronal and recombinant receptors correspond to the binding affinity of the low-affinity receptor variant. These findings indicate that the high-affinity binding measured in heterologous expression systems represents an immature receptor variant that does not contribute to the currents recorded from these cells, and that the functional low-affinity receptors are present in such small number that they are effectively masked in binding assays by the high-affinity receptors. Thus, in order to compare experimentally determined saturation binding profiles with those predicted by kinetic receptor models and with dose-response curves from physiological studies, it will be imperative to develop methods for isolating first the low-affinity receptors.

[I-125]iodoMLA bound throughout the brain with the greatest density in the thalamus and moderate intensity in the basal ganglia and cortical regions. The Kd and Bmax in whole brain tissue were similar whether 1 mM nicotine (Kd 33.25 +/- 15.17 nM, Bmax 5.80 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) or 2 mu M of the alpha 7-selective antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (Kd 46.12 +/- 18.45 nM, Bmax 6.30 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) was used for nonspecific binding. The subtype-selectivity of this ligand was further studied with competition binding studies using nicotine, alpha-bungarotoxin and noniodinated MLA. Each ligand completely inhibited [I-125]iodoMLA binding throughout the monkey brain, with Ki values of 2.23 +/- 0.85 mu M for nicotine, 2.72 +/- 1.71 nM for alpha-bungarotoxin and 1.83 +/- 0.35 nM MLA in the caudate and 2.03 +/- 1.14 mu M, 2.65 +/- 0.86 nM and 3.32 +/- 0.71 nM, respectively, in the putamen. The alpha 3 beta 2/alpha 6*-selective antagonist alpha-conotoxin MII failed to inhibit [I-125]iodoMLA binding in any brain region. In monkeys with cognitive deficits resulting from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration, [I-125]iodoMLA binding was significantly increased in the striatum, similar to results previously observed for [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. These results suggest that, under the present experimental conditions, [I-125]iodoMLA was selective for alpha 7-containing nAChRs and did not bind to alpha 6-containing nAChRs. This radioligand may be a useful tool for selectively imaging alpha 7-containing nAChRs in vivo.

In this study, we investigated the role of the amino acid residues in the COOH terminus of the human P2Y(1) receptor in G(q) activation. Stimulation of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells stably expressing the wild-type human P2Y(1) receptor (P2Y(1)-WT cells), P2Y(1)-DeltaR340-L373, or P2Y(1)- DeltaD356-L373 with 2-methylthio-ADP (2-MeSADP) caused inositol phosphate production. In contrast, cells expressing P2Y(1)-DeltaT330-L373, a mutant lacking the entire COOH terminus, completely lost their response to 2-MeSADP. Similar data were obtained by using these cell lines and measuring Ca2+ mobilization upon stimulation with 2-MeSADP, indicating that the 10 amino acids (330TFRRRLSRAT339) in the COOH terminus of the human P2Y(1) receptor are essential for Gq coupling. Radioligand binding demonstrated that both the P2Y(1)-WT and P2Y(1)-DeltaT330-L373-expressing cells have almost equal binding of [H-3] MRS2279, a P2Y(1) receptor antagonist, indicating that COOH-terminal truncation did not drastically affect the conformation of the receptor. CHO-K1 cells expressing a chimeric P2Y(12) receptor with the P2Y(1) COOH terminus failed to elicit G(q) functional responses, indicating that the P2Y(1) COOH terminus is essential but not sufficient for G(q) activation. Finally, cells expressing a double-mutant P2Y(1) receptor (R333A/R334A) in the conserved BBXXB region of the COOH terminus of the G(q)-activating P2Y receptors completely lost their functional ability to activate G(q). We conclude that the two arginine residues (R333R334) in the COOH terminus of the human P2Y(1) receptor are essential for G(q) coupling.

To investigate the presence of somatostatin and its receptors (sst(1-5) receptors) and their possible involvement in the regulation of nitric oxide (NO) production in human RPE cell cultures. Methods. Human RPE cells (D407) were used for all studies performed. Somatostatin levels were detected by radioimmunoassay, and RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry studies were performed to identify the somatostatin receptors (sst(1)-sst(5)). Radioligand binding assays were also performed examining the ability of certain somatostatin ligands (sst(1), sst(2), sst(5)) to compete for [I-125]Tyr(11) somatostatin binding. The presence of NO synthase in the cultures was assayed with NADPH-diaphorase cytochemistry, and RT-PCR, and NO levels were assessed by examining the production of its stable metabolites NO2- and NO3- (NOx-). Results. SRIF was detected in a concentration of 0.56+/-0.13 picomoles/mg protein. sst(1), sst(2), and sst(5) mRNAs were detected, yet only sst(2B) and sst(5) immunoreactivity was observed in human RPE cell cultures. sst(1)- and sst(5)- but not sst(2)-selective ligands displaced the specific [I-125]Tyr(11) somatostatin binding to RPE cell membranes. NADPH-diaphorase stain and iNOS mRNA were detected. SRIF and the sst(2)-selective analogue MK678 increased the levels of NOx- in a concentration-dependent manner. This increase was blocked by the sst(2) antagonist CYN-154806 (Ac-4NO(2)-Ph-(dCys-Tyr-dTrp-Lys-Thr-Cys)-dTyr-NH2). Conclusions. These results demonstrate the presence of somatostatin, and its receptors sst(1), sst(2B), and sst(5) in human RPE cells and suggest an autocrine or paracrine role for somatostatin. Somatostatin's ability to regulate NO production, by activating sst(2) receptors, provides a functional role of somatostatin in the RPE.

Moreover, specific cardiac binding sites for GHSs have been suggested. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the natural ligand ghrelin and synthetic GHS peptide hexarelin and analogues have direct effects on the cardiomyocyte cell line, H9c2. Hexarelin stimulated thymidine incorporation in a dose-dependent manner with significant responses at 3 muM (147 +/- 3% of control, P < 0.01) and elicited maximal effects at concentrations around 30 mu M. This activity was seen already after 12 h of incubation with a maximal effect after 18 h (176 +/- 9% of control, P < 0.01). Ghrelin also had a significant stimulatory effect on thymidine incorporation (129 +/- 2% of control at 3 muM and 18 h, P < 0.05). The stimulatory effect on thymidine incorporation of hexarelin, Tyr-Ala-hexarelin, EP80317 and ghrelin was specific and no stimulatory effect was observed with the truncated GH-releasing peptide EP51389 or the non-peptidyl GHS MK-0677. In competitive binding studies, I-125-labeled Tyr-Ala-hexarelin was used as radioligand and competition curves showed displacement with hexarelin, Tyr-Ala-hexarelin, EP80317 and ghrelin, whereas MK-0677 and EP51389 produced very little displacement at 1 mu M concentration, adding further support for an alternative subtype binding site in the heart compared with the pituitary. In conclusion, we have demonstrated a dose-dependent and specific stimulation of cardiomyocyte thymidine incorporation by natural and synthetic GHS analogues, suggesting increased cell proliferation and binding of GHS to H9c2 cardiomyocyte cell membranes. These findings support potential peripheral effects of GHS on the cardiovascular system independent of an increased GH secretion.

B2R was sequestered to a major extent upon exposure to BK, as determined by the loss of cell-surface B2R using radioligand binding and by imaging of B2R-GFP using laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Concurrent BK sequestration was revealed by the appearance of acid-resistant specific BK receptor binding. The same techniques showed that B1R was sequestered to a considerably lesser extent upon binding of des-Arg(10)-kallidin. B2R sequestration was rapid (half-life similar to5 min) and reached a steady-state level that was significantly lower than that of BK sequestration. B2R sequestration was minimally inhibited by K44A dynamin (22.4 +/- 3.7%,), and was insensitive to arrestin-(319-418), which are dominant-negative mutants of dynamin I and beta -arrestin respectively. Furthermore, the B2R-mediated sequestration of BK was completely insensitive to both mutants, as was the association of BK with a caveolae-enriched fraction of the cells. On the other hand, agonist-promoted sequestration of the beta (2)-adrenergic receptor was dramatically inhibited by K44A dynamin (81.2 +/- 16.3%) and by arrestin-(319-418) (36.9 +/- 4.4%). Our results show that B2R is sequestered to a significantly greater extent than is B2R upon agonist treatment in HEK293 cells. Furthermore, B2R appears to be recycled in the process of sequestering BK, and this process occurs in a dynamin- and beta -arrestin-independent manner and, at least in part,. involves caveolae.

This study was undertaken to evaluate in detail the interaction of edrophonium with muscarinic M-2 and M-3 receptors. Methods: A functional study was conducted to evaluate the effects of edrophonium on the concentration-response curves for the negative chronotropic effect and the bronchoconstricting effect of carbachol in spontaneously beating right atria and tracheas of guinea pigs. An electrophysiologic study was conducted to compare the effects of edrophonium on carbachol-, guanosine triphosphate (GTP)gamma S-, and adenosine-induced outward K+ currents in guinea Dig atrial cells by whole cell voltage clamp technique. A radioligand binding study was conducted to examine the effects of edrophonium on specific [H-3]N-methylscopolamine (NMS) binding to guinea pig atrial (M-2) and submandibular gland (M-3) membrane preparations, and on atropine-induced dissociation of [H-3]NMS. Results: Edrophonium shifted rightward the concentration-response curves for the negative chronotropic and bronchoconstricting effects of carbachol in a competitive manner. The pA(2) values for cardiac and tracheal muscarinic receptors were 4.61 and 4.03, respectively. Edrophonium abolished the carbachol-induced outward current without affecting the GTP gamma S- and adenosine-induced currents in the atrial cells. Edrophonium inhibited [H-3]NMS binding to M-2 and M-3 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner. The pseudo-Hill coefficient values and apparent dissociation constants of edrophonium for M-2 and M-3 receptors were 1.02 and 1.07 and 21 and 34 muM, respectively. Edrophonium also changed dissociation constant values of [H-3]NMS without affecting its maximum binding capacities. Conclusion: Edrophonium binds to muscarinic M-2 and M-3 receptors nonselectively, and acts as a competitive antagonist.

The training set was designed applying a fractional factorial design using six physicochemical descriptors. The amide moiety is a bicyclohydantoin or a diketopiperazine (X = -(CH2)(3)-, -(CH2)(4)-; m = 0, 1), the spacer length is 3 or 4 methylene units, which are the optimum values for both receptors, and the aromatic substituent R occupies the ortho- or meta-position and has been selected from a database of 387 substituents using the EDISFAR program. The 5-HT1A and alpha (1)-adrenergic receptor binding affinities of synthesized compounds VI (1-32) have been determined. This data set has been used to derive classical quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and neural-networks models for both receptors (following paper). A comparison of these models gives information for the design of the new ligand EF-7412 (46) (5-HT1A: K-i = 27 nM; alpha (1): K-i > 1000 nM). This derivative displays affinity for the dopamine D-2 receptor (K-i = 22 nM) and is selective versus all other receptors examined (5-HT2A, 5-HT3, 5-HT4 and Bz; K-i > 1000 nM). EF-7412 (46) acts as an antagonist in vivo in pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT1A receptor sites and; as an antagonist in the dopamine D-2 receptor. Thus, EF-7412 (46) is a derivative with mixed 5-HT1A/D-2 antagonist properties and this derivative could be useful as a pharmacological tool.

Alterations in glutamate-mediated transmission at N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-sensitive receptors in hippocampus have been implicated in the pathophysiology of the illness. The authors tested the hypothesis that glutamatergic transmission within and efferent from hippocampus is altered in schizophrenia. Method: The authors analyzed postmortem hippocampal tissue from individuals with schizophrenia and from healthy individuals. The tissue samples had been collected by two brain tissue banks, one in Maryland and the other in Melbourne, Australia. Ionotropic receptor binding for the NMDA, kainate, and H-3-amino-3hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors was quantified by using usual radioligand techniques. In situ hybridization autoradiography was used to quantify mRNA for the NMDA receptor subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B. Results: Ligand binding to the ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA, kainate, and AMPA) did not differ significantly overall or in any subregion between the schizophrenia tissue and the healthy comparison tissue. The only exception was AMPA receptor binding in hippocampal subregion CA2, which was slightly but significantly less in schizophrenia. However, the level of mRNA for the NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2B was significantly different between groups; in several hippocampal subregions, the level of NR1 mRNA was lower and the level of NR2B mRNA higher in schizophrenia. Conclusions: Because the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor is critical to full receptor activity, a reduction of NR1 in hippocampus in schizophrenia suggests a functional impairment in glutamatergic transmission at the NMDA receptor, resulting in reduced glutamatergic transmission within and possibly efferent from the hippocampus in schizophrenia. This defect could underlie a hypoglutamatergic state in regions of limbic cortex, consistent with published results from other lines of research in schizophrenia.

Comparisons were made by evaluating times and costs of the radiolabeling process, imaging features including pharmacokinetics, and impact on patient management. The analysis of advantages and drawbacks of both radioligands might help to make a better choice based on firm data. For [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11, the radiochemical yield (RCY) using a low starting activity (L, average activity of 596.55 +/- 37.97 MBq) was of 80.98 +/- 0.05%, while using a high one (H, average activity of 1436.27 +/- 68.68 MBq), the RCY was 71.48 +/- 0.04%. Thus, increased starting activities of [Ga-68]-chloride negatively influenced the RCY. A similar scenario occurred for [F-18]PSMA-1007. The rate of detection of PCa lesions by Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) was similar for both radioligands, while their distribution in normal organs significantly differed. Furthermore, similar patterns of biodistribution were found among [F-18]PSMA-1007, [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11, and [Lu-177]Lu-PSMA-617, the most used agent for RLT. Moreover, the analysis of economical aspects for each single batch of production corrected for the number of allowed PET/CT examinations suggested major advantages of [F-18]PSMA-1007 compared with [Ga-68]Ga-PSMA-11. Data from this study should support the proper choice in the selection of the PSMA PET radioligand to use on the basis of the cases to study.

Here we report the in vitro and in vivo profile of RGH-235, a new potent, selective, and orally active H-3 receptor antagonist/inverse agonist developed by Gedeon Richter Plc. Radioligand binding and functional assays were used for in vitro profiling. Procognitive efficacy was investigated in rodent cognitive tests, in models of attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) and in cognitive tests of high translational value (rat touch screen visual discrimination test, primate fixed-foreperiod visual reaction time task). Results were supported by pharmacokinetic studies, neurotransmitter release, sleep EEG and dipsogenia. RGH-235 displayed high affinity to H-3 receptors (K-i = 3.0-9.2 nM, depending on species), without affinity to H-1, H-2 or H-4 receptors and >100 other targets. RGH-235 was an inverse agonist ([S-35] GTP gamma S binding) and antagonist (pERK1/2 ELISA), showing favourable kinetics, inhibition of the imetit-induced dipsogenia and moderate effects on sleep-wake EEG. RGH-235 stimulated neurotransmitter release both in vitro and in vivo. RGH-235 was active in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR), generally considered as a model of ADHD, and revealed a robust pro-cognitive profile both in rodent and primate tests (in 0.3-1 mg/kg) and in models of high translational value (e.g. in a rodent touch screen test and in nonhuman primates). The multiple and convergent procognitive effects of RGH-235 support the view that beneficial cognitive effects can be linked to antagonism/inverse agonism of H-3 receptors.

Recent studies suggest improved therapeutic efficacy using the SST2 peptide antagonist [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201. However, little is known about the cellular mechanisms that lead to the observed differences. In the present in vitro study, we compared kinetic binding, saturation binding, competition binding, cellular uptake and release of [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 versus [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE using HEK cells stably transfected with the human SST2. While [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 and [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE exhibited comparable affinity (K-D, 0.15 +/- 0.003 and 0.08 +/- 0.02 nM, respectively), [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 recognized four times more binding sites than [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Competition assays demonstrated that a high concentration of the agonist displaced only 30% of [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 bound to HEK-SST2 cell membranes; an indication that the antagonist binds to additional sites that are not recognized by the agonist. [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 showed faster association and slower dissociation than [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE. Whereas most of [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 remained at the cell surface, [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE was almost completely internalised inside the cell. The present data identified distinct differences between [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 and [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE regarding the recognition of receptor binding sites (higher for [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201) and their kinetics (faster association and slower dissociation of [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201) that explain, to a great extent, the improved therapeutic efficacy of [Lu-177]Lu-OPS201 compared to [Lu-177]Lu-DOTA-TATE.

However, there have been few clinical reports based on a large population about the prevalence of zinc transporter 8 autoantibody (ZnT8A) and other islet auto antibodies in AITD patients. We aimed to explore the presence of islet autoantibodies, ZnT8A, glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies (GADA) and insulinoma-associated antigen 2 autoantibodies (IA-2A) compared with thyroid autoantibodies, thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TGAb) and thyrotropin receptor autoantibodies (TRAb) in patients with Graves' disease (GD), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) and T1DM patients with AITD. Methods: Totally, 389 patients with GD, 334 patients with HT, 108 T1DM patients with AITD and 115 healthy controls (HC) were recruited in the study. Islet autoantibodies (ZnT8A, GADA and IA-2A) were detected by radioligand binding as say. Thyroid autoantibodies, TPOAb and TGAb were detected by chemiluminescence assay, and TRAb was detected by RIA. Results: The prevalence of ZnT8A, GADA and IA-2A was higher in GD and HT patients than that of HC (ZnT8A: GD 8.48%, HT 10.8% vs HC 1.74%; GADA: GD 7.4 6%, HT 7.74% vs HC 0.870%; IA-2A: GD 4.88%, HT 3.59% vs HC 0%; All P < 0.05) but lower than that of T1DM subjects with AITD (ZnT8A: 42.6%; IA-2A: 44.4%; GADA: 74.1%; all P < 0.0001). Conclusions: An increased prevalence of ZnT8A as well as GADA and IA-2A was found in both GD and HT patients, indicating that there is a potentia llink between thyroid autoimmunity and islet autoimmunity.

P2X3 receptor antagonists have been identified as promising drugs to treat chronic cough and are suggested to offer pain relief in chronic pain such as neuropathic pain. Here, we analysed whether compounds affect P2X3 receptor activity by high-throughput screening of the Spectrum Collection of 2000 approved drugs, natural products and bioactive substances. We identified aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA) as a nanomolar-potency antagonist of P2X3 receptor-mediated responses. Two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology-based concentration-response analysis and selectivity profiling revealed that ATA strongly inhibits the rP2X1 and rP2X3 receptors (with IC50 values of 8.6 nM and 72.9 nM, respectively) and more weakly inhibits P2X2/3, P2X2, P2X4 or P2X7 receptors (IC50 values of 0.76 mu M, 22 mu M, 763 mu M or 118 mu M, respectively). Patch-clamp analysis of mouse DRG neurons revealed that ATA inhibited native P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors to a similar extent than rat P2X3 and P2X2/3 receptors expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In a radioligand binding assay, up to 30 mu M ATA did not compete with [H-3]-ATP for rP2X3 receptor binding, indicating a noncompetitive mechanism of action. Molecular docking studies, site-directed mutagenesis and concentration-response analysis revealed that ATA binds to the negative allosteric site of the hP2X3 receptor. In summary, ATA as a drug-like pharmacological tool compound is a nanomolar-potency, allosteric antagonist with selectivity towards a(3-methylene-ATP-sensitive P2X1 and P2X3 receptors.

Hence, the present study is focused on the development of Tc-99m-labeled bivalent DTPA-bis-c(RGDfK) conjugate and its preclinical evaluation on human tumor cell lines expressing alpha(v)beta(3) targets. Homobivalent DTPA-bis-c(RGDfK) was prepared and assessed for its affinity and specificity in alpha(v)beta(3) positive (and negative) receptor cell lines. DTPA-bis-c(RGDfK) conjugate was labeled with Tc-99m and subjected to cells/tissue sections. Localization of alpha(v)beta(3) expression was corroborated using immunostaining and ex vivo imaging of the distribution pattern of Tc-99m-DTPA-bis-c(RGDfK). The radiolabeling of the DTPA-bis-c(RGDfK) with Tc-99m is obtained after 45 min at 95 degrees C with a radiochemical yield of about 45%. Radiochemical purity was >95% after C18 Oasis HLB cartridge purification with specific activity of 1475 GBq mmoL(-1). In vitro experiments showed high affinity and specificity for alpha(v)beta(3) with IC50 of 32.86 +/- 7.83 nmol L-1. Ex vivo imaging on tissue sections confirmed preliminary specificity results. In vivo analysis in a mouse model showed that this tracer was able to detect and readily identify U87MG and B16F10 alpha(v)beta(3) positive tumors 60 minutes post-injection. c(RGDfK) blocking experiments confirmed its excellent affinity and specificity to alpha(v)beta(3) receptors in U87MG tumors. The radiotracer was mainly excreted through the renal route with minimal radioactivity being excreted through the hepatobiliary route. Tc-99m-DTPA-bis-c(RGDfK) can be an excellent scintigraphic agent for imaging of alpha(v)beta(3) receptors being expressed in abundance in malignant glioma and melanoma cancer.

A greater understanding of the binding kinetics of small molecule allosteric ligand interactions with CCR5 will lead to a better understanding of the binding process and may help discover new molecules that avoid resistance. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH Using [H-3] maraviroc as a radioligand, a number of different binding protocols were employed in conjunction with simulations to determine rate constants, kinetic mechanism and mutant kinetic fingerprints for wild-type and mutant human CCR5 with maraviroc, aplaviroc and vicriviroc. KEY RESULTS Kinetic characterization of maraviroc binding to the wild-type CCR5 was consistent with a two-step kinetic mechanism that involved an initial receptor-ligand complex (RA), which transitioned to a more stable complex, R'A, with at least a 13-fold increase in affinity. The dissociation rate from R'A, k(-2), was 1.2 x 10(-3) min(-1). The maraviroc time-dependent transition was influenced by F85L, W86A, Y108A, I198A and Y251A mutations of CCR5. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS The interaction between maraviroc and CCR5 proceeded according to a multi-step kinetic mechanism, whereby initial mass action binding and later reorganizations of the initial maraviroc-receptor complex lead to a complex with longer residence time. Site-directed mutagenesis identified a kinetic fingerprint of residues that affected the binding kinetics, leading to the conclusion that allosteric ligand binding to CCR5 involved the rearrangement of the binding site in a manner specific to each allosteric ligand.

Imaging dopamine transmission in the frontal cortex: a simultaneous microdialysis and [<SUP>11</SUP>C]FLB 457 PET study	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						[C-11]FLB 457; positron emission tomography; microdialysis	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EXTRACELLULAR DOPAMINE; ENDOGENOUS DOPAMINE; RECEPTOR-BINDING; RHESUS-MONKEY; AMPHETAMINE; RELEASE; STRIATUM; COCAINE	In a recent human positron emission tomography (PET) study we demonstrated the ability to detect amphetamine-induced dopamine (DA) release in the prefrontal cortex as a reduction in the binding of the DA D-2/3 radioligand [C-11]FLB 457. A key requirement for validating this paradigm for use in clinical studies is demonstrating that the changes in [C-11]FLB 457 binding observed with PET following amphetamine are related to changes in dialysate DA concentration as measured with microdialysis. Microdialysis and PET experiments were performed to compare, in five rhesus monkeys, amphetamine-induced DA release and [C-11]FLB 457 displacement in the frontal cortex after three doses of amphetamine (0.3 mg kg(-1), 0.5 mg kg(-1) and 1.0 mg kg(-1)). Amphetamine led to a significant dose-dependent increase in dialysate (0.3 mg kg(-1): 999+/-287%; 0.5 mg kg(-1): 1320+/-432%; 1.0 mg kg(-1): 2355+/-1026%) as measured with microdialysis and decrease in [C-11]FLB 457 binding potential (BPND, 0.3 mg kg(-1): -6+/-6%; 0.5 mg kg(-1): -16+/-4%; 1.0 mg kg(-1): -24+/-2%) as measured with PET. The relationship between amphetamine-induced peak DDA and D[C-11]FLB 457 BPND in the frontal cortex was linear. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the magnitude of dialysate DA release is correlated with the magnitude of the reduction in [C-11]FLB 457 BPND in the frontal cortex. The use of the [C-11]FLB 457-amphetamine imaging paradigm in humans should allow for characterization of prefrontal cortical DA release in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and addiction.

Imaging Imidazoline-I<sub>2</sub> Binding Sites in Porcine Brain Using <SUP>11</SUP>C-BU99008	JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE			English	Article						PET; imidazoline; I-2; BU99008; C-11	I-2-IMIDAZOLINE RECEPTORS; SELECTIVE LIGAND; DENSITY; ALPHA(2)-ADRENOCEPTORS	Changes in the density of imidazoline-I-2 binding sites have been observed in a range of neurologic disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, and glial tumor; however, the precise function of these sites remains unclear. A PET probe for I-2 binding sites would further our understanding of the target and may find application as a biomarker for early disease diagnosis. Compound BU99008 has previously been identified as a promising I-2 ligand from autoradiography studies, displaying high affinity and good selectivity toward the target. In this study, BU99008 was radiolabeled with C-11 in order to image the I-2 binding sites in vivo using PET. Methods: C-11-BU99008 was radiolabeled by N-alkylation of the desmethyl precursor using C-11-methyl iodide. A series of PET experiments was performed to investigate the binding of C-11-BU99008 in porcine brains, in the presence or absence of a nonradiolabeled, competing I-2 ligand, BU224. Results: C-11-BU99008 was obtained in good yield and specific activity. In vivo, C-11-BU99008 displayed good brain penetration and gave a heterogeneous distribution with high uptake in the thalamus and low uptake in the cortex and cerebellum. C-11-BU99008 brain kinetics were well described by the 1-tissue-compartment model, which was used to provide estimates for the total volume of distribution (V-T) across brain regions of interest. Baseline V-T values were ranked in the following order: thalamus > striatum > hippocampus > frontal cortex >= cerebellum, consistent with the known distribution and concentration of I-2 binding sites. Administration of a selective I-2 binding site ligand, BU224, reduced the V-T to near-homogeneous levels in all brain regions. Conclusion: C-11-BU99008 appears to be a suitable PET radioligand for imaging the I-2 binding sites in vivo.
